commentary_dict = {"Blessings 4.6": ["When a person recites a blessing on bread, it also includes - This halachah has raised questions among the commentaries. The<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, and others interpret this halachah as referring to the blessings before eating. Thus, with regard to bread, it is to a large part analogous to Halachah 11.<br>In this context, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> asks why the Rambam did not mention these laws in the context of Chapter 3, Halachot 5-7, which state the rule that the blessing on primary foods includes secondary foods. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> answers that those halachot describe a situation where the person has no desire to eat the secondary food in its own right and eats it only because of the primary food. In this halachah, the Rambam is speaking about an instance in which one desires to eat the other foods; nevertheless, they are included in the blessing recited over bread because bread includes all other foods.<br>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> offers a different interpretation, which appears more appropriate to the context in which the laws are discussed. Here, the Rambam is speaking only about the blessing recited after eating.<br>", "the appetizers - In his Commentary on the Mishnah,<i>Berachot</i> 6:5 (the source for this halachah), the Rambam defines the term \u05e4\u05e8\u05e4\u05e8\u05ea as \u05dc\u05e4\u05ea\u05df, which is generally translated as \"relish.\" Note the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 176:1), which offer a different interpretation of the term \u05e4\u05e8\u05e4\u05e8\u05ea.<br>", "eaten together with bread - This does not refer only to instances when these foods are eaten while placed on bread, but also to times when they are eaten at a meal at which bread is served.<br>", "e.g., cooked food or fruit. - Because the main element of a meal is considered to be bread, reciting a blessing upon it - either before or after partaking of it - includes the other foods that are eaten together with it.<br>", "Reciting a blessing on these foods, however, does not include bread. - The commentaries question why this clause is necessary according to the Rambam's definition of \u05e4\u05e8\u05e4\u05e8\u05ea. It is obvious that bread would not be considered secondary to any other foods.<br>", "Reciting a blessing on cooked grains - Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and on Chapter 3, Halachah 4.<br>", "includes cooked food. - Since the cooked grains are considered \"sustaining food\" and have been granted a special blessing which includes (in synopsis) all the blessings of grace, reciting a blessing over them includes other cooked dishes eaten with them.<br>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> emphasizes that this applies to cooked foods that are eaten together with the grains. Otherwise, it would be difficult to understand how the blessing for the grains could cover foods that require other blessings. Note also the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, which offers an alternate explanation.<br>", "Reciting a blessing on cooked food, however, does not include cooked grains. - Since these cooked foods are not as satisfying as grains, the blessing recited over them cannot include grains.<br>Several commentaries have raised the question that from <i>Berachot</i> 42b, it appears that the Rambam's decision follows the School of Shammai and not the School of Hillel. The clearest resolution of the difficulty is offered by the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i>, who explains that the Rambam's decision is based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 6:5). When the passage from the Babylonian Talmud is studied in the light of the passage from the Jerusalem Talmud, the Rambam's ruling is no longer difficult.<br>This relates to a concept frequently discussed by students of the Rambam: Does the Rambam accept the principle that when there is a difference of opinion between the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud, the Halachah follows the Babylonian Talmud, or not?<br>"], "Blessings 4.7": ["A person who decides not to continue eating or drinking - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Pesachim</i> 103b, which states that once a person diverts his attention from drinking wine, he must recite another blessing when he begins drinking again.<br>The Ra'avad notes that the passage from <i>Pesachim</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions only drinking and does not discuss eating, and on that basis protests against the Rambam's equation of the two. From <i>Berachot</i> 42a, however, it appears that similar principles apply with regard to eating.<br>", "and afterwards changes his mind and [desires to] eat or drink, must recite another blessing - before partaking of the food or drink. He is not, however, required to recite a blessing after the first food or drink. Rather, he is required to recite only a single blessing after he completes eating.<br>", "although he has not changed his place. - As mentioned in Halachot 3-5, a person who changes his place while eating must recite both a blessing after the food he has eaten previously and a blessing over the food he plans to eat in his new place.<br>Many authorities do not accept the Rambam's decision with regard to a meal that includes bread. When a person sits down to such a meal, he is considered to have fixed his attention on eating. People frequently become drawn into eating more than they originally intended at such meals. Thus, a person's decision not to continue eating is not considered final, since it is quite possible that he will change his mind and decide to eat again. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 179:1).<br>Based on these principles, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 179:1) rules that, although once a person has decided to cease eating or drinking a new blessing is generally required, when partaking of a meal it is not sufficient to make a mental decision, and a person must wash before grace to be considered to have ceased eating.<br>", "If he - remained in the place in which he ate originally, and<br>", "did not decide [to cease] eating or drinking and had in mind to continue - eating at a later time<br>", "even if he made an interruption for the entire day - The Rambam's terminology appears to be a stylistic exaggeration. If a person waits long enough for the food he has eaten to digest, it would appear that he is required to recite another blessing before beginning to eat again (<i>Kin\u2019at Eliyahu</i>).<br>", "he is not required to recite a second blessing - before partaking of more food or drink.<br>"], "Blessings 4.8": ["When people who are sitting together - after having completed a meal<br>", "and drinking say - This refers to a consensus agreed to by all the participants, and not a mere suggestion raised by a single individual.<br>", "\"Let us recite grace,\" or \"Let us recite kiddush,\" - i.e., they were eating on Friday afternoon or the afternoon before a festival. From sunset onward, it is forbidden to continue eating until one recites <i>kiddush</i>. It is, however, possible to recite <i>kiddush</i> early (see <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:11). Once the people agree to recite <i>kiddush</i>, they may no longer continue their meal (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "they are - considered to have diverted their attention from drinking, as mentioned in the previous halachah. Hence, they are<br>", "forbidden to continue drinking until they recite grace or kiddush. - The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 179:2 states that, according to the authorities who differ with the Rambam on the previous halachah, if one's desire to drink stems from having eaten, one may continue to drink at this point.<br>", "Should they desire to drink more - although they are not permitted to do so - i.e., they are obligated to recite grace or<i>kiddush</i> before drinking. Should they desire to ignore that obligation and drink immediately,<br>", "before reciting grace or kiddush, they are required to recite the blessing borey pri hagafen before drinking - because, as mentioned in the previous halachah, the blessing they recited originally does not cover any drink consumed after they concluded drinking.<br>", "In contrast, should they say, \"Let us recite havdalah,\" they are not required to recite a blessing [should they continue drinking]. - The difference between <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdalah</i> is that <i>kiddush</i> initiates the Sabbath. Accordingly, the respect due to the Sabbath adds importance to the diversion of our attention from drinking implied by the statement, \"Let us recite <i>kiddush</i>.\" In contrast, <i>havdalah</i> marks the beginning of the week, which we are not required to treat with such distinction. Thus, as <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:12 states, a person is not required to interrupt his meal at nightfall on Saturday, but may continue and recite <i>havdalah</i> when he concludes eating (Radbaz).<br>24. <i>Berachot</i> 59b emphasizes that this blessing is recited only when one drinks in a company. When one drinks alone, this blessing should not be recited, because it praises God for \"being good\" - i.e., to me - and \"doing good\" - for others (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 175:4).25. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) notes that the Sages instituted this blessing only for different types of wine and not for different types of bread or meat, since wine has two positive qualities: It satisfies a person's appetite and lifts his spirits.26. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), states that this blessing should be recited only when the second type of wine is better than the first. If the first type of wine is better, no blessing should be recited. The commentaries maintain that the Rambam differs and maintains that the blessing should be recited whenever one changes types of wine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 175:2-3) rules that if one knows that the second type of wine is of a lesser quality than the first, the blessing should not be recited.<br>"], "Blessings 4.10": ["A person should not recite a blessing over any food or drink until it is brought before him. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:4) states that a person should hold the food in his right hand before reciting the blessing for it.<br>", "If he - ignored the above directive and<br>", "recited a blessing, and then the food was brought before him - The blessing is considered to be in vain, and before partaking of the food,<br>", "he must recite a second blessing. - There are some authorities who maintain that even though the food was not before one at the time the blessing was recited, if one was absolutely sure that it would be brought before him immediately, he can rely on that blessing (<i>Mishneh Berurah</i> 206:19).<br>", "When a person took food in his hand and recited a blessing, but [before he could eat it] it fell from his hand and was burned or washed away by a river - or in any other way became inedible<br>", "he should take other food and recite another blessing - i.e., the first blessing is no longer in effect ,and a second blessing must be recited before eating.<br>", "[This applies] even when the food is of the same species. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:6) adds, \"and even if the other fruit was before him when he recited the blessing originally.\" The Ramah (based on the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>) differs, and maintains that if he originally intended to partake of the other fruit as well, it is included in the first blessing and he should eat it without hesitation so that the blessing will not have to be repeated.<br>", "He should also say, \"Blessed be the Name of Him whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever\" for the first blessing, so that he will not be considered to have recited a blessing in vain. - See Chapter 1, Halachah 15, which discusses the seriousness of reciting a blessing in vain. See also <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 12:9-11, where the Rambam discusses related concepts, concluding:<br>The Torah has adjured us \"to fear [His] glorious and awesome name.\" Included in this fear is that it should not be mentioned in vain. If, because of a slip of the tongue, one mentioned God's name in vain, one should immediately praise and laud... it.<br>", "A person may stand over a stream of water, recite a blessing, and drink. - The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 6:1) mentions this instance as a contrast to the previous law.<br>", "Although the water that was before him at the time he recited the blessing is not the water he drinks, this was his original intention. - He knew that the water would continue to flow. When he recited the blessing on the water, his intent was on water from the stream and not on the particular water before him at the time he recited the blessing.<br>"], "Blessings 4.11": ["Foods that are eaten within the meal, because of the meal. - The Rambam's statements are quoted, with slight changes, from <i>Berachot</i> 41b. In his commentary on this passage, Rashi defines this first category of foods as relishes eaten with bread. He explains that other foods - e.g., cereals or vegetables - although they are eaten as part of a meal, require an independent blessing.<br><i>Tosafot</i> differs, and maintains that any food that is eaten as part of a meal - e.g., the foods mentioned by Rashi, meat or fish - is included in this category. Even if they are not eaten with bread, merely at the same meal, they<br>", "do not require a blessing beforehand or afterward. - The commentaries question whether the Rambam's position follows that of Rashi or <i>Tosafot</i>. The following sentence (which is the Rambam's addition to <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) sheds light on the question.<br>", "Rather, the blessing hamotzi that is recited in the beginning and the grace recited afterward include everything, because everything is secondary to the meal. - This sentence explains the rationale for this ruling. These foods are not eaten casually during the day, but rather are eaten only as part of a meal, with the intent of satiating one's appetite. Accordingly, they are considered as secondary to bread, which is the primary element of the meal (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 177:1). Accordingly, we follow the ruling mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, that the blessing on primary foods includes secondary foods.<br>This explanation appears to indicate that the Rambam follows<i>Tosafot's</i> interpretation. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 171:1) also rules accordingly. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:1, however, postulates that it is logical to assume that this ruling applies only when bread is eaten throughout the meal. If only a small amount of bread is eaten at the beginning of a meal, and no bread is eaten while the main course is being eaten, it is questionable whether the blessing over the bread covers these foods.<br>", "Foods that are eaten within the meal, but do not come because of the meal - This refers to fruits and the like, which are not satisfying food and are eaten throughout the day, frequently outside the context of a meal, but at times within the context of a meal. This indicates that they are not necessarily connected with the meal and, therefore, are not included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. Accordingly, they<br>", "require a blessing before partaking of them, but do not require a blessing afterward. - Since they are eaten within the meal, they also satisfy a person's appetite. Accordingly, they are included in the blessing that is required by the commandment, \"When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless....\"<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:1,3, based on Rabbenu Asher's commentary on <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions two instances when fruit is included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>:<br>a) When the fruits are eaten on bread itself,b) When one eats a meal of fruit - i.e., the fruit is served to satiate one's appetite.<br>", "Foods that are eaten after the meal, whether because of the meal - i.e., foods served to satiate one's appetite<br>", "or independent of the meal -fruits, desserts, or drinks<br>", "require a blessing beforehand and afterward. - <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) states that this law does not apply at present. Our eating habits have changed, and bread is constantly before us during a meal, and it is customary to partake of it at all times.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> position. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:7 adds that even at large feasts, when it is customary to eat desert without eating bread, a new blessing is not required because, in Talmudic times, bread and the main course were served on a small table, which was then removed, and dessert was served on a new table. Thus, the dessert appeared as a separate meal and required separate blessings. In contrast, at present, desert is served on the same table on which the bread was served. Hence, it is still considered a continuation of the same meal and does not require a separate blessing.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.1": ["The order of the fulfillment of these mitzvot -- the mitzvot of eating matzah, maror, and <i>charoset</i>, and of relating the story of the Exodus.<br>", "on the night of the fifteenth [of Nisan] -- and in the Diaspora, on the night of the sixteenth of Nisan<br>", "is as follows: In the beginning -- It is customary to begin the Seder as soon as possible after nightfall, in order that the children will be able to remain awake and participate in the Seder.<br>", "a cup [of wine] is mixed -- with water, as stated in Halachah 7:9.<br>", "for each individual -- See Halachah 7:7.<br>", "and they recite the blessing, \u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0 \u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d2\u05e4\u05df", ", and the kiddush of the day on it and the blessing, shehecheyanu -- which is recited whenever a person fulfills a mitzvah that is not performed frequently.

The use of the term \"eating\" in halachah implies a minimum of a \u05db\u05d6\u05d9\u05ea (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). Nevertheless, this opinion is not accepted. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 473:6, states that less than a \u05db\u05d6\u05d9\u05ea should be eaten, in order that no question arise as to whether or not one is obligated to recite a blessing afterwards.<br>", "He and all those eating together with him, each and every one, do not eat less than a<br>\u05db\u05d6\u05d9\u05ea \u2014 Despite the fact that a \u05db\u05d6\u05d9\u05ea is eaten, the Rambam does not require the recitation of the blessing, \u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea, after eating the vegetable.

The <i>Emek HaSh'eylah</i> explains that if one forgot to recite a blessing over the <i>Chaggigah</i>, one might think that the blessing recited over the Paschal sacrifice would suffice for the previous mitzvah as well. Hence, this opinion must be negated.<br>", "for] the [Chaggigah] offering -- This follows the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Nevertheless, <i>Pesachim</i> 121a quotes Rabbi Yishmael, who offers an alternate opinion.<br><i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains these Sages' difference of opinion as follows: The blood of the Paschal sacrifice is to be poured out against the base of the Temple altar. In contrast, the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> should be sprinkled on the two opposite corners of the altar.<br>Rabbi Yishmael maintains that \u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3 (after the fact), were a person to pour the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering on the base of the altar, he would be considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Hence, the blessing for the Pesach offering can apply to the <i>Chaggigah</i> as well.<br>In contrast, Rabbi Akiva maintains that even \"after the fact,\" the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is not acceptable if its blood is not sprinkled on the altar as prescribed. Accordingly, the blessing for the Pesach offering has no connection to the <i>Chaggigah</i> at all.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's decision. In <i>Hilchot P'sulei HaMukdashim</i> 2:2, the Rambam writes: \"Whenever [blood] is prescribed to be presented [on the altar] by sprinkling, and it was presented by pouring, one has fulfilled his obligation,\" accepting the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. If so, his acceptance of Rabbi Akiva's opinion here appears to present a contradiction.<br>Rav Yechezkel Landau (<i>Tz'lach, Pesachim</i> ibid.) attempts to resolve the issue, explaining that the Rambam follows the interpretation of Rav Chayim HaCohen (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> ibid.), who favored a different text of the Talmud and, accordingly, an alternate interpretation of the difference in opinion between the two Sages.<br>Rav Chayim maintains that Rabbi Yishmael considers the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering as secondary to the Paschal sacrifice. (See also Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:7.) Hence, reciting a blessing over the Paschal sacrifice, the essential element (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8) of the evening, also fulfills the requirement for the secondary element (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), the <i>Chaggigah</i>. Indeed, regarding the blessings recited over food, the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 3:5) that whenever there are two foods, one essential and one secondary, it is only necessary to recite a blessing over the essential food. A blessing is not required for the secondary item.<br>This interpretation itself presents a question: Since the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted only for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice and is not an obligation in its own right, it can be considered as \"secondary\" to the Pesach sacrifice. If so, what is the rationale for Rabbi Akiva's opinion?<br>It can be explained that Rabbi Akiva never considers one mitzvah as secondary to another. We may use the labels \"primary\" and \"secondary\" in regard to matters dependent on our will, but not in regard to mitzvot which we fulfill in obedience to God's desires. Therefore, though the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted because of the Paschal sacrifice, once it has been instituted, it must be considered as a mitzvah in its own right, with its own importance. Hence, it requires a unique blessing of its own (R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitch Haggadah).<br>", "[Conversely, the blessing for the Chaggigah] offering does not free one of [the obligation of the blessing for] the Paschal sacrifice. -- Both Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael agree with this decision.<br>This law can also be explained within the context of the discussion of \"primary\" and \"secondary\" mentioned above. Since the Paschal sacrifice follows the <i>Chagigah</i> offering, for the Paschal sacrifice should be eaten when satisfied, one might presume that it is considered as \"secondary\" to the <i>Chagigah</i>. Hence, the Sages must negate this presumption.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.8": ["At present, when there is no [Paschal] sacrifice, -- Note the opinions mentioned on p. 34 of the Moznaim edition of <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i>, which question whether the Paschal sacrifice can be offered on the Temple Mount even before the Temple is rebuilt.<br>", "after one recites the blessing, hamotzi lechem -- holding a complete matzah and the broken half, as explained in Halachah 6.

Though the Ra'avad curtly dismisses these words as \"emptiness,\" the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> quote previous authorities, Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Yitzchak ibn Giat, who also require dipping the matzah in <i>charoset</i>.<br>The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> explains the difference between the Rambam and the Ra'avad as follows: As mentioned in Halachah 7:11, <i>charoset</i> is a mitzvah commemorating the mortar used by our ancestors. Hence, the Rambam maintains that it should be eaten together with both the matzah and the maror.<br>The Ra'avad maintains that matzah commemorates two different qualities: the \"bread of poverty\" eaten in Egypt and the matzot our ancestors carried out from Egypt after being redeemed. In contrast, maror and <i>charoset</i> are both symbols of slavery.<br>While the Temple was standing, the Ra'avad did not object to the matzah being dipped in <i>charoset</i>, because, as above, it also commemorates our ancestors' slavery. However, after the Temple's destruction and the negation of the mitzvah of maror, we may assume that the other symbols of the enslavement are also negated. Hence, the only mitzvah is the commemoration of the redemption associated with the matzah. Accordingly, it should not be mixed with charoset, which recalls the slavery.<br>", "and eats it. -- at least a \u05db\u05d6\u05d9\u05ea, while leaning on the left side, as prescribed above.<br>", "Afterwards -- All opinions agree that at present, the matzah is not to be eaten together with the maror. While the Temple was standing, they could be eaten together - since they were both mitzvot, partaking of one mitzvah could not negate another.

Accordingly, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> concludes that although it is permissible to drink a fifth cup, it is not proper to do so.<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXVII, suggests a different interpretation of this halachah, noting that the Rambam does not mention that the fifth cup is drunk. A fifth cup is mixed and placed on the table, and the \"great Hallel\" is recited over it. However, that cup should not be drunk. Thus, the fifth cup is not included as one of the four. Rather, it is a separate and independent obligation.<br>The Vilna Gaon (see <i>Ta'amei HaMinhagim</i> 551) associates the fifth cup with the cup of Elijah. The Talmud concludes the discussion of many unresolved questions with the statement: \u05ea\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5. Literally, the term is a shortened form of the word \u05ea\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd, \"let it remain\". However, it is also interpreted as an acrostic for the expression \u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d9\u05ea\u05e8\u05e5 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea - \"The Tishbite (Elijah) will answer all questions and difficulties.\"<br>Since the requirement of the fifth cup remains an unresolved question, the fifth cup is left for Elijah in the hope that he will come soon and resolve this question as well.<br>The homiletic aspects of this comment notwithstanding, from a halachic perspective a differentiation must be made between the two. The fifth cup is of Talmudic origin and may be poured for each individual. In contrast, Elijah's cup is an Ashkenazic custom of later origin, and a single cup is used for the whole family. Indeed, they are mentioned by halachists in different chapters of the Shulchan Aruch: the fifth cup by the Ramah in Chapter 481 and Elijah's cup by the <i>Chok Ya'akov</i> in Chapter 480.<br>", "One may complete the Hallel wherever one desires, even though it is not the place where one ate. -- A number of different halachic questions would arise should a person decide to leave the home in which he is holding the Seder from the <i>kiddush</i> until the conclusion of the grace after meals.

This opinion is accepted by the later Ashkenazic authorities.<br>", "[However,] if some members of a company slept in the middle of the meal -- Since the other members of the company remained awake,<br>", "they may eat again -- They need not recite new blessings over the food, as explained in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, Chapter 178.<br>", "If they all fell into a sound slumber -- and hence the eating of the entire company has been interrupted.<br>", "and then awoke, they should not eat -- for the reasons explained above.<br>", "If they all [merely] dozed -- i.e., though drowsy, they would be able to respond to questions, the eating of the company is not considered to have been interrupted, and<br>", "they may eat.<br>"], "Blessings 1.1": ["It is a positive mitzvah - <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 19) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 430) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>", "from the Torah - as opposed to the other blessings, which were ordained by the Rabbis.<br>", "to bless [God] after eating satisfying food - The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> and others interpret \"satisfying food\" as referring to bread made from the five species of grain mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 1. Significantly, the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and the <i>Noda BiYhudah</i> maintain that with this expression, the Rambam is implying that the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>, which is recited over other foods made from these species, also has its source in the Torah itself (See also <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 209).<br>", "as [Deuteronomy 8:10] states: \"When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless God, your Lord.\"<br>", "The Torah itself requires a person to recite grace only when he eats to the point of satiation - The Rabbis do not specify a standard quantity or measure of food that a person must eat to have reached this state. Rather, they leave the matter up to the person's own feelings.<br>", "as implied by the above verse, \"When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless....\" - The proof-text clearly indicates that the obligation to \"bless\" applies only when one is \"satiated.\"<br>", "The Sages, however, ordained - <i>Berachot</i> 20b relates:<br>The angels complained to the Holy One, blessed be He: \"...In Your Torah, it is written [that You] 'will not show favor, nor take bribes,' and yet You show favor to the Jews....\"God replied: \"Are the Jews not worthy that I show them favor?

Thus, it has all the authority of a Torah law. Though the Rambam (see the Introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, General Principle 2) refers to laws derived in this manner as \u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e1\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd - literally, \"from the words of our Sages,\" the same term used here - his intent is not to imply that the law did not originate in the Torah itself.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot,</i> loc. cit.), however, explain that the Talmud ultimately does not accept the interpretation that the obligation is derived from the Torah, and maintain that the obligation to recite blessings is Rabbinic in origin. Even according to these opinions, it appears that the Sages ordained the recitation of blessings rather early in our national history. Midrashim referring to the age of King David explicitly mention the recitation of blessings, and there are intimations of this obligation in references to earlier periods. See also the commentary on Halachah 5.<br>", "that we recite blessings before partaking of any food. -<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, states: \"It is forbidden to benefit from this world without reciting a blessing.\" Therefore,<br>", "Even when one wants to eat the slightest amount of food or drink - i.e., less than a <i>k'zayit</i> or a <i>revi'it</i><br>", "one should recite a blessing, and then derive benefit from it. - In this instance, however, a blessing need not be recited after eating or drinking.<br>", "Similarly, when smelling a pleasant fragrance, one should recite a blessing - See Chapter 9 with regard to the particular blessings required.<br>", "and then smell. - <i>Berachot</i> 43b quotes Psalms 150:6: \"All souls shall praise God,\" and asks: \"From what does a soul benefit?

A blessing beforehand must nevertheless be recited, because \"it is forbidden to benefit from this world without a blessing.\"<br>There is, however, a law which appears to be an exception to this principle:<br>", "A person who [merely] tastes food is not required to recite a blessing before partaking of it or afterwards unless he partakes of a revi'it. - Rav David Arameah explains that this law applies only when one spits out the food one tastes. If one swallows it, a blessing is required. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> differs, and maintains that even when a person swallows the food, since his intent is not to benefit from it - but merely to taste it - and he partakes of only a very small amount, a blessing is not required.<br>"], "Blessings 1.3": ["Just as we recite blessings for benefit which we derive from the world - as explained above,<br>", "we should also recite blessings for each mitzvah before we fulfill it. - The laws governing the blessings recited over the performance of mitzvot are discussed in Chapter 11.<br>", "Similarly, the Sages instituted many blessings as expressions of praise and thanks to God and as a means of petition - See Chapter 10.<br>", "so that we will always remember the Creator, even though we have not received any benefit or performed a mitzvah. - By reciting blessings over the special events which occur to us, we become conscious of God's control of all aspects of our daily existence.

Rather, just as explained with regard to prayer, before Ezra's time each person would recite the blessings according to his own inspiration and ability to express himself. In Ezra's time, many people had difficulty expressing themselves eloquently and, therefore, Ezra and his court established a standard text.<br>", "It is not fit to alter it - to substitute different words<br>", "to add to it, or to detract from it. Whoever alters the text of a blessing from that ordained by the Sages is making an error. - The Radbaz (Vol. 5, Responsum 1424) states that as long as the person mentions God's name, His sovereignty over the world, and the subject of the blessing, he fulfills his obligation even if he does not use the text ordained by the Sages. (This interpretation is borne out by the next halachah.)<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's phraseology alludes to two types of changes:a) Changes which do not substantially alter the blessing from the text ordained by the Sages. With regard to such changes, the Rambam uses the expression \"it is not fit,\" which implies that although the person's deed is not desirable, he fulfills his obligation.b) A change of an innovative nature which alters the text of the blessing entirely. These changes the Rambam considers as \"errors\" which prevent a person from fulfilling his obligation.

Although there are other opinions that maintain that as long as the blessing is recited in Hebrew, one fulfills his obligation, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> concludes that it is preferable for a person who does not understand Hebrew to recite the blessings - in particular, the grace - in a language he understands.<br>", "[A person who] changes that text - reciting a different blessing from that ordained by the Sages<br>", "fulfills his obligation nonetheless - since he mentioned God's name, His sovereignty, and the subject of the blessing - although he did so in a ordinary language. \u2013I.e., a language other than \u201cthe Holy Tongue,\u201d Hebrew. See <i>Berachot</i> 40b, which states that a person who recites the phrase \"Blessed be God, Master of this bread\" in Aramaic fulfills his obligation for the first blessing of grace.

When a person recites a blessing over bread and before eating says, \"Bring salt,\" \"Bring food,\" \"Give --- to eat,\" \"Bring food for the animal,\" or the like - See <i>Berachot</i> 40a and commentaries, which explain why each of these statements is connected with the meal.<br>", "he need not repeat the blessing.<br>"], "Blessings 1.9": ["A person who is ritually impure is permitted to recite all the blessings. - In <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 4:8, the Rambam states:<br>The words of Torah never contract impurity. Rather, they remain pure forever, as [Jeremiah 23:29] states: \"Are not My words as fire....\" Just as fire can never contract impurity, the words of Torah never contract impurity.<br>In <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4, the Rambam applies these same principles to the words of prayer.<br>", "This applies regardless of whether the impurity is of a type from which one can purify oneself on the same day - e.g., the impurity which comes as a result of contact with the carcass of an animal.

Each Jew shares a responsibility for his colleague's observance. Therefore, although he personally has already recited the blessing, he has not discharged his obligation entirely until each of his fellow Jews fulfills the requirements incumbent upon him.<br>", "so that they can fulfill their obligation. - The Rambam describes the manner in which the listener fulfills his obligation in the next halachah.<br>For the above principle to apply, however, the listener must be obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. When the listener is not obligated - e.g., a woman for shofar blowing - a person should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated himself (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 589:6).<br>", "There is, however, one exception: blessings over benefit which is not associated with a mitzvah - e.g., the blessings recited over food in an ordinary meal.<br>", "In this instance, one may not recite a blessing for others unless one enjoys benefit together with them. - In this instance, there is no obligation for a person to partake of this food. Hence, the principle of \u05e2\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea does not apply (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>) unless the person reciting the blessing also desires to partake of the food. Should he desire to do so, the blessing he recites may include others as well. (Note an alternate explanation in the commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 16.)<br>", "Nevertheless, one may recite blessings for benefit which is associated with a mitzvah - e.g., eating matzah on Pesach and reciting kiddush [on Sabbaths and festivals] - i.e., not only the blessing <i>al achilat matzah</i>, which mentions the mitzvah of eating <i>matzah</i>, but also the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>, which is recited for eating bread; not only the blessing of <i>kiddush</i>, but also the blessing <i>borey pri hagafen</i>, on the wine.<br>", "for others - since, in this instance, the only way the mitzvah can be fulfilled is by eating the food.<br>Note the <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 273, which states that, at the outset, a person who has already recited <i>kiddush</i> should not recite <i>kiddush</i> for others, unless they are incapable of doing so themselves.<br>", "They may then eat or drink, even though the one [who recites the blessing] does not eat or drink with them. - Note <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>, which states that a person is not allowed to recite<i>hamotzi</i> to enable a colleague to partake of the Sabbath meal when he does not join them. There is reason to assume that, since partaking of such a meal is a mitzvah, one would be allowed to recite a blessing, and thus enable a colleague to do so. Nevertheless, following the reasoning mentioned in <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:20) and commentaries mention only the examples cited by the Rambam.<br>"], "Blessings 1.11": ["Whenever a person listens to the entire recitation of a blessing with the intention of fulfilling his obligation - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:3) rules that the person reciting the blessing also must intend that the listener fulfill his obligation by hearing the blessing.<br>The <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the <i>Bayit Chadash</i> 213 explain that this ruling points to a question of a larger scope: Do mitzvot of the Rabbis require intention, or is it possible to fulfill one's obligation by performing the required act without any intent.<br>According to the latter view, although the person reciting the blessing does not have the intention of fulfilling the obligation of the listener, since \"one who listens is considered as though he responded,\" the listener is considered to have recited the blessing, and thus to have fulfilled his obligation.<br>In contrast, the former view requires that one have a conscious desire to fulfill one's obligation when fulfilling a Rabbinic obligation. Since the person reciting the blessing did not have such an intention on behalf of the listener, the listener cannot fulfill his obligation.<br>", "he is considered to have fulfilled his obligation although he does not answer Amen. - According to the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:13, 213:1), this applies to all blessings. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:1) differs, however, and explains that with regard to blessings for mitzvot, the principle stated by the Rambam is acceptable. With regard to blessings for deriving benefit, however, different rules apply, and a person can fulfill his obligation to recite a blessing by listening to someone else's blessing only when they intentionally sit down to break bread or drink wine together. See the commentary on the following halachah.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 38b states:<br>What is the source which teaches that a person who listens is considered as if he responded?[II Kings 22:16] mentions: \"all the words of the scroll read by the king.\" Did Josaiah [the king] read them? Shafan read them.... Thus, this teaches that a person who listens is considered as if he responded.<br>", "Whoever answers Amen to a blessing recited by another person is considered as if he recited the blessing himself - <i>Berachot</i> 53b mentions two opinions, one which equates the person answering<i>Amen</i> with the person actually reciting the blessing (the opinion cited by the Rambam), and one which considers the person answering to be on an even higher level.<br>Thus, with this statement, the Rambam is explaining that, although a person can fulfill his obligation by listening without answering <i>Amen</i>, when he answers he is considered as if he actually recited the blessing himself (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "provided the person who recites the blessing is obligated to recite that blessing. - This excludes a blessing recited by a mentally incapable individual, a deaf-mute, or a child, who are not obligated to fulfill mitzvot (<i>Berachot</i> 20a, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 29a).<br>In Chapter 5, Halachot 15-16, the Rambam mentions that an adult who did not eat a full meal and is obligated to recite grace only by Rabbinic decree can fulfill his obligation by listening to the blessings recited by a child. This, however, is a unique instance and does not apply to blessings recited in the prayer service or over the fulfillment of other mitzvot. With regard to grace, the child's recitation of the blessings comes as a result of a single Rabbinic obligation. Hence, he can fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of an individual whose obligation is also Rabbinic in origin.<br>In contrast, with regard to other blessings, the blessings themselves are Rabbinic in origin, and the child's obligation to recite them constitutes a second Rabbinic obligation. Accordingly, he cannot fulfill the mitzvah for someone whose obligation stems from a single Rabbinic decree (<i>Tosafot,</i> Megillah 19b).<br>", "If the person who recites the blessing is obligated only because of a Rabbinic ordinance - e.g., an adult male who has not eaten to the point of satiation<br>", "while the person responding is obligated by Torah law - an adult who ate to the point of satiation<br>", "the listener cannot fulfill his obligation until he repeats - word for word<br>", "in response [to the one reciting the blessings] - Our translation (based on <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> and the <i>Bnei Binyamin</i>) does conform to Biblical and Mishnaic interpretations of the word \u05d9\u05e2\u05e0\u05d4. It does, however, appear slightly forced. Nevertheless, it is the most appropriate way to interpret the Rambam's words according to the halachah which states that, only with regard to grace, may an adult fulfill his obligation to recite a blessing by answering <i>Amen</i> to a child's blessing.<br>Rav Kapach presents a unique thesis, maintaining that in this halachah the Rambam is teaching us that an adult can fulfill his obligation to recite any blessing by responding <i>Amen</i> to a blessing recited by a child. His interpretation, though contrary to the accepted halachah, allows for a more direct translation of the Rambam's words.<br>", "or until he hears [the blessing recited] by someone who, like him, is obligated by Torah law. - In the latter case, the listener is not obligated to recite <i>Amen</i>.<br>"], "Blessings 1.12": ["When many people gather together to eat [a meal with] bread or to drink wine, and one recites the blessing - Our translation follows the standard text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.

They fulfill their obligation by listening to the blessing recited previously.<br>", "If, however, they did not intend to eat together, but rather they each came on their own initiative, although they all eat from a single loaf of bread, each one should recite the blessings [before eating] by himself. - Although this is the desired practice, if one answers <i>Amen</i> to another person's blessing, he fulfills his obligation, as stated in the previous halachah.<br>This reflects the position of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:13). The <i>Magen Avraham</i>, however, differs, and maintains that one cannot fulfill his obligation to recite blessings that involve benefit unless one had the intention of eating together with the other person and responding to his blessings. This view takes a more lenient position regarding blessings over mitzvot, which we are obligated to fulfill, than regarding the blessings over food, which we are not obligated to eat.<br>", "When does the above apply? With regard to bread and wine. With regard to other foods, however, which do not require [premeditated intent] to be eaten together as a group - Our interpretation of \u05d4\u05e1\u05d1\u05d4 is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i>, <i>Berachot</i> 6:6.<br>", "if one person recited a blessing and everyone answered Amen, they may eat and drink although they did not intend to gather together as a group. - The Ra'avad differs and maintains that when eating foods other than bread or wine, each person should recite the blessings for himself.

However, it has raised difficulties among the commentaries and its authenticity has been challenged.)<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:1) accepts the Rambam's opinion, but states that this applies only when people sit around a single table as a group.

Furthermore, the <i>Magen Avrahamh</i> 6:9 mentions an obligation to recite<i>Amen</i> ninety times each day.<br>", "to respond Amen - <i>Shabbat</i> 119b states that <i>Amen</i> is an acronym for the words, \u05d0-\u05dc \u05de\u05dc\u05da \u05e0\u05d0\u05de\u05df (God, faithful King). In that passage, our Sages declare that, \"the Gates of <i>Gan Eden</i> will be opened for a person who answers <i>Amen</i> with all his strength.\"<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 124) explains that <i>Amen</i> implies an acknowledgement of the truth of a statement.

One should not respond Amen if the person reciting the blessing is a gentile - Although the latter word is surrounded by parentheses in the standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (indicating a question with regard to its inclusion), it is found in all the authoritative manuscripts and reflects the Rambam's statements in his Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 8:8, the source for this law).<br>The reason we do not respond to a gentile's blessing is that we assume that although he mentions God's name, his blessing is directed toward the alien deity in which he believes.<br>Rabbenu Asher maintains that a person should respond <i>Amen</i> to a gentile's blessing when he hear the blessing recited in its entirety and he supports his statements with a quote from the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 8:8. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 215:2) quotes this opinion. There is not necessarily a contradiction between the latter ruling and the Rambam's. The Rambam's statements can be interpreted as applying to gentiles in general, while those of the Jerusalem Talmud, as applying to those gentiles - e.g., Moslems - who are known not to worship any idols or alien gods.<br>", "an apostate - Since, \"It can be assumed that an apostate has false gods in mind (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 2:5),\" we are forbidden to respond to his blessings.<br>", "a Samaritan - In his Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam elaborates in the description of the Samaritans. He explains that after Sancheriv exiled the ten tribes, he settled several gentile tribes in their land. These tribes adopted certain aspects of Jewish practice.

There, the Talmud relates that the synagogue in Alexandria was so large that flags would be waved as a signal that the <i>chazan</i> had finished a blessing, and then everyone would recite <i>Amen</i>, even though they had not heard the blessing themselves.<br>[Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets \"an orphaned <i>Amen</i>\" as reciting <i>Amen</i> although one does not know which blessing was recited. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) accepts the stringencies that result from both opinions.<br>"], "Blessings 1.15": ["Whoever recites a blessing for which he is not obligated is considered as if he took God's name in vain. - See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 12:9-10, where the Rambam states that a person who intentionally recites a blessing in vain should be placed under a ban of ostracism.<br>Note Chapter 4, Halachah 10, which states that after reciting an unnecessary blessing, one should praise God, saying, \"Blessed be the Name of Him whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever\" so that his mention of God's name will not be in vain.<br>", "He is considered as one who took a false oath - The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 30) states that, with this statement, the Rambam intended to imply that the person should be lashed in punishment. Other Rabbis rule less severely, stating that although this punishment is not administered, the person is considered to have violated the commandment, \"Do not take God's name in vain.\" <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 215:3, however, maintains that since he intended to recite a blessing, his mention of God's name is not entirely frivolous, and he is hence considered to have violated a Rabbinic prohibition and not the commandment of the Torah itself.<br>", "and it is forbidden to answer Amen after his blessing. - For this reason, it is forbidden to recite a blessing unnecessarily - e.g., to recite two blessings when a single blessing is sufficient. Similarly, for this reason, a person who is unsure of whether or not he is obligated to recite a blessing should not recite it, lest he recite a blessing in vain.<br>Despite the severity of the prohibition against taking God's name in vain<br>", "We may teach children the blessings using the full text. Even though in this manner, they recite blessings in vain in the midst of their study, it is permissible - so that the child will learn how to recite blessings properly.<br>", "One should not recite Amen after their blessings. - The source of this halachah, <i>Berachot</i> 53b, indicates that this law applies only when the children are reciting the blessings for practice. When they are reciting the blessings to fulfill their obligation, we should respond <i>Amen</i>.<br>", "A person who answers Amen after their blessings does not fulfill his obligation. - Note our commentary on Halachah 11, which explains that only with regard to grace (see Chapter 3, Halachot 15- 16) may an adult fulfill his obligation by reciting <i>Amen</i> to a blessing recited by a child.<br>"], "Blessings 1.16": ["It is demeaning for a person to recite Amen after his own blessings. - This does not refer to the recitation of a single blessing (which is discussed in Halachah 18), but the recitation of<i>Amen</i> after each blessing recited in a series of blessings. Reciting <i>Amen</i> is considered demeaning because it implies a conclusion of one's prayers. It is not proper to conclude and begin, conclude and begin, several times in one series (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "When, however, one concludes the last of a series of blessings, it is praiseworthy to answer Amen - This serves as a statement that one has concluded one's prayers with praise of God.<br>", "e.g., after the blessing Boneh Yerushalayim in grace - The third blessing in grace. Note also the following halachah. This example is explicitly mentioned by <i>Berachot</i> 45b, the source for this halachah.<br>", "and after the final blessing [following] the recitation of the Shema in the evening service. - This example was chosen by the Rambam himself. The Rambam specifies the evening service because he considers the recitation of <i>Amen</i> at this point in the morning service as an interruption between the blessing \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc and the beginning of <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<br>", "Similarly, always, at the conclusion of the last of a series of blessings, one should recite Amen after one's own blessing. -<i>Tosafot, Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 215:1) state that <i>Amen</i> is recited only after <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i> and not after other series of blessings. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 54:1 explains this ruling, stating that there is another advantage to reciting <i>Amen</i> after <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i>: It differentiates between blessings required by the Torah and those ordained by Rabbinic decree.<br>"], "Blessings 1.17": ["Why is Amen recited after the blessing Boneh Yerushalayim although it is followed by the blessing Hatov v'hametiv? - On the surface, the latter blessing, and not the blessing <i>Boneh Yerushalayim</i>, marks the conclusion of the blessings of grace.<br>", "Because the latter blessing was ordained in the era of the <i>Mishnah</i> - See Chapter 2, Halachah 1, and commentary.<br>", "and is considered to be an addition. The conclusion of the essential blessings of grace is Boneh Yerushalayim. - Hence <i>Amen</i> is recited at this point. As mentioned in the commentary on the previous halachah, its recitation differentiates between the blessings required by the Torah and those instituted by the Rabbis.<br>", "Why is Amen not recited after the blessing Ahavat olam? - Its recitation would be appropriate because <i>Ahavat olam</i> concludes the two blessings recited before the <i>Shema</i>.<br>", "Because it is the conclusion of the blessings recited before the Shema - and an interruption should not be made between these blessings and the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>.<br>", "Similarly, in other instances when [a series of] blessings are recited before a practice - e.g., the blessings recited before the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> or the kindling of the Chanukah lights - when two or three blessings are recited in succession,<br>", "Amen [is not recited] lest it constitute an interruption between the blessings and [the fulfillment of] the performance over which they are being recited. - See Halachah 8.<br>"], "Blessings 1.18": ["Why is Amen not recited after the blessing over fruits and the like? - The Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that the Rambam is not referring to the blessing recited before partaking of fruit. All agree that one should not recite <i>Amen</i> after such a blessing, because <i>Amen</i> would constitute an interruption between the blessing and partaking of the fruit. Rather, the Rambam is speaking about the blessing <i>al hapairot</i> or other similar blessings.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam on this matter and suggests that a person should recite <i>Amen</i> after concluding any of these blessings. The later authorities, however, accept the Rambam's decision.<br>", "Because it is only a single blessing, and Amen is recited only after a concluding blessing that follows another blessing or blessings - e.g., the blessings of the king - The series of seven blessings recited by the king after reading from the Torah at the <i>Hakhel</i> gathering held in the Temple once every seven years (<i>Hilchot Chaggigah</i> 3:4)<br>", "or the blessings of the High Priest - The series of eight blessings recited by the High Priest after reading from the Torah during the Temple service on Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Avodat Yom HaKippurim</i> 3:11).<br>", "to signify the conclusion of the blessings. Therefore, reciting Amen is appropriate. - The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:4) also cites the blessings recited after the haftarah as an example of a sequence at whose conclusion it is appropriate to recite <i>Amen</i>.<br>"], "Blessings 1.19": ["When a person eats a forbidden food - whether consciously or inadvertently - he should not recite a blessing beforehand or afterward. - It is improper to bless God after transgressing His commandments. On the contrary, concerning a similar incident, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 1:5) cites Psalms 10:3, \"A thief who recites a blessing disgusts God.\" Even an inadvertent violation of the law is an act against His will for which it is not appropriate to bless Him.<br>The Ra'avad and Rabbenu Asher differ with the Rambam's decision and maintain that the fact that a person violates a commandment against eating forbidden food should not cause him to violate another commandment and benefit from the world without praising God. The<i>Turei Zahav</i> 196:1 attempts to resolve the two views and offers a compromise: A person who intentionally violates a prohibition should not recite a blessing. If, however, a person eats a forbidden food inadvertently, he should recite a blessing afterwards.<br>Significantly, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 196) explains that even the Rambam would agree that a sick person who is required to eat a forbidden food for medicinal purposes should recite a blessing. There are, however, authorities who differ with this ruling as well.<br>", "What is implied? If one eats tevel - grain, oil, or wine from which <i>terumah</i> was not separated<br>", "even food that is classified as tevel by Rabbinical decree - e.g., produce that grows in containers. According to Torah law, the agricultural gifts are required to be given only from produce that grows in the earth itself (Rambam's Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i>, <i>Berachot</i> 7:1).<br>", "the first tithe from which terumah was not separated - Even when the first tithe was separated before <i>terumah</i>, <i>terumah</i> should be separated from the tithe as well (<i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>", "or the second tithe - which must be eaten in Jerusalem. If this is not possible, the food can be redeemed and the money brought to Jerusalem to purchase food there. It is forbidden to eat this food outside Jerusalem until it is redeemed (Deuteronomy 14:22-27). In this instance, we are speaking about a situation where the redemption was improperly performed - e.g., one used uncoined metal (the Rambam's Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i>, <i>Berachot</i> 7:1).<br>", "or sanctified foods - foods consecrated to the Temple<br>", "that were not redeemed in the proper manner,- They were redeemed using landed property, which is unacceptable (<i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>", "one should not recite a blessing. Needless to say, this applies if one ate meat from an animal that was not ritually slaughtered - but rather, died naturally or was slaughtered without using the proper procedure<br>", "or was trefah - An animal attacked by a wild beast or diseased and therefore suffering from an affliction that will cause it to die within twelve months (<i>Hilchot Shechitah</i>, Chapter 5).<br>", "or if one drank wine used as a libation for idol worship. - It is forbidden to drink such wine. See <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i>, Chapter 11.<br>"], "Human Dispositions 1.1": ["Each and every man possesses many character traits. Each trait is very different and distant from the others. - Many commentaries assume that the Rambam is stating simply that there are many personality types, which he proceeds to describe: e.g., the angry man, the calm man, etc. They quote various sources in support of this viewpoint, among them <i>Berachot</i> 58a: \"Whoever sees a multitude of Jews recites the blessing: 'Blessed is...the wise who knows the hidden secrets,' because just as their natures are not similar, neither are their faces.\"<br>However, by stating that the many character traits are possessed by \"each and every man,\" it is possible that Rambam is implying more than that there are people with different traits. Though in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (The Guide to the Perplexed) 2:40 the Rambam himself elaborates upon that idea, it can be said that here his intent is different. He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual's personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other. Anger, generosity, and modesty, for example, can be found together in the same person, much in the same way that tenants of all sorts - unrelated to each other - can be housed in a common building.<br>To illustrate these traits, the Rambam employs concrete examples of extreme personalities, so that the contrasts can be appreciated more easily.<br>", "One type of man is wrathful; he is constantly angry. [In contrast,] there is the calm individual who is never moved to anger - Obviously, anger or passivity are not these individuals' only traits. Surely, they share the full spectrum of human emotions. However, in these individuals, these traits are most prominent.<br>See Halachah 2:3 for a further discussion of anger.<br>", "or, if at all, he will be slightly angry, [perhaps once] during a period of several years.", "There is the prideful man and the one who is exceptionally humble. - Chapter 2, Halachah 3, also deals at length with the contrasts between pride and humility.<br>", "There is the man ruled by his appetites, who will never be satisfied from pursuing his desires - <i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 1:34 states: \"No person will die having accomplished [even] half of what he desires.\" This statement is difficult to comprehend since there appear to be many successful individuals who achieve their desires. Nevertheless, their accomplishments do not necessitate that their desires will be satisfied. As the <i>Midrash</i> continues: \"A person who possesses 100 silver pieces desires 200. One who possesses 200 desires 400.\"", "Desire itself is never satisfied. Instead, it puts the person on a constantly moving treadmill, with ever-increasing aims. As soon as one reaches one goal, he instinctively begins the pursuit of another.", "and [conversely,] the very pure of heart, who does not desire even the little that the body needs. - This pair of contrasting personality types deal with a person's appetites which can be satisfied by sensual experience. For example, gluttony is stimulated and satisfied by taste. In contrast, the traits mentioned below - the desire for money or the lack of desire for it - do not involve the senses.<br>", "There is the greedy man, who cannot be satisfied - Literally, \"whose soul is not satisfied.\" Perhaps the Rambam uses \"soul,\" both here and with regard to the man ruled by his sensual appetites, because it is the desire that characterizes the man, not the performance of an action as such. A man may never indulge his passion for food, or actually amass money and yet, be gluttonous or greedy. Though, in practice, his ability to gratify his ambitions may be limited by external factors, the desires of his soul are, nonetheless, unlimited.<br>", "with all the money in the world, as [Ecclesiastes 5:9] states: \"A lover of money never has his fill of money.\" - Here, the Rambam describes an example where the desire for money becomes a goal in itself. In contrast, a man who gathers money so that he can buy things or achieve power is not interested in money per se. Although he may be faulted for different reasons, he is not greedy for money. On the other hand, for the \"lover of money,\" money itself becomes his raison d'etre.<br>", "[In contrast,] there is the man who puts a check on himself; - literally, he \"cuts himself short.\" II Kings 19:26 employs a similar usage of the root <i>ketzar</i>: \"And the inhabitants are broken, with shortened (i.e., weakened or useless) arms.\"<br>", "he is satisfied with even a little, which is not enough for his needs, and he does not bother to pursue and attain what he lacks. - This refers to a lazy person, who will not bestir himself even for that which is necessary. In Chapter 2, Halachah 7, this type is described clearly as: \"lazy and an idler.\" This is the description, too, in the Rambam's Introduction to <i>Avot - Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4.<br>", "There is [the miser,] - In contrast to the \"lover of money\" mentioned above, the miser is not as bent on acquiring new wealth as much as hoarding the money and possessions he has.<br>who torments himself with hunger, gathering [his possessions] close to himself. - The terminology the Rambam uses emphasizes the miser's need to be close to his money and possessions. Similar, but not exactly correspondent, expressions are found in the Bible (Proverbs 13:11  and the Talmud (<i>Bava Kama</i> 80a).<br>", "Whenever he spends a penny of his own, he does so with great pain. [Conversely,] there is [the spendthrift,] who consciously wastes his entire fortune. - <i>Chullin</i> 84b gives examples of such behavior: wearing linen clothing, using glass utensils, and hiring workers without supervising them.", "All other traits follow the same pattern [of contrast]. For example: the overly elated and the depressed; - The Rambam is not referring to an average optimist and a pessimist. Rather, he describes personalities who do not have a grip on reality. <i>onain</i> is the term used for the bereaved who has not yet buried his dead. <i>mehulal</i>, the other extreme, is used by Jeremiah 51:7 to refer to a state of intoxication and delirious drunkenness.<br>", "the stingy and the freehanded - Our translation of <i>shua</i> is clearly evident from <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 7:11. It follows that <i>chili</i> represents the opposite extreme. (See also Ibn Ezra, Isaiah 32:5.)<br>The difference between this pair of traits and the miser-spendthrift pair mentioned above is that the latter refers to a person's conduct toward himself, while the former refers to his conduct with regard to others. The stingy man, unlike the miser, may spend money for his own needs, but is tightfisted when others are concerned. By the same token, a freehanded man need not necessarily indulge himself, though he is generous when giving charity. Though this may sound praiseworthy, when taken to extremes it can also prove dangerous, because a person may hurt himself in the process of giving excessively to another. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)<br>", "the cruel and the softhearted; the coward and the rash and the like. - We find a longer treatment of personal characteristics in the Rambam's <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4.<br>"], "Human Dispositions 1.2": ["Between each trait and the [contrasting] trait at the other extreme, there are intermediate points, each distant from the other. - The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> understands this as follows: Let us imagine a line drawn from one extreme to another - between the stingy and the freehanded, for example. All who are neither stingy nor freehanded stand between them. They are all intermediate, whether they tend towards stinginess or freehandedness. Each point along this imaginary line stands apart - \"is distant\" - from the others on that line. In a diagram, this idea might be depicted as follows:X-----*-------*------*-------*----------*---------*XStingy intermediate points freehanded.<br>However, it is highly unlikely that all the Rambam wishes to teach us is that there are many intermediate points of temperament between the extremes. After all, that is self-evident. Furthermore, in each set of associated temperaments - for example, stinginess and freehandedness - only three points on the line are of importance to the Rambam in clarifying his view of personality development: the two extremes and the midpoint. Why should he mention all the other intermediate possibilities?<br>Thus, it appears that the Rambam is telling us that there is a midpoint temperament between each pair of contrasting extremes. Given the entire range of human temperaments, there are a number of midpoints which are not necessarily related to each other. For example, the midpoint for generosity may be very different from the midpoint for humility. Thus, in Halachah 1, the Rambam stated that our personality traits are \"different and distant;\" in this halachah, he makes a parallel statement about the midpoints.<br>", "With regard to all the traits: a man has some from the beginning of his conception - i.e., the Rambam distinguishes between genetic traits and those that are acquired.<br>", "in accordance with his bodily nature. - Here, we see an interrelation between body and soul. Certain temperaments are produced by or relate to particular physical characteristics.<br>[In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam states: \"From the outset of a person's [life], he has neither virtues nor vices....\" However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> and this halachah. The possession of certain character traits does not determine whether one will use them for a vice or a virtue.]<br>", "Some are appropriate to a person's nature and [therefore,] will be acquired more easily than other traits. - i.e., these traits are not transferred genetically. However, a person is born with a tendency towards them.<br>In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam elaborates on this issue at length. He explains that some people are born with a brain whose internal chemistry is prone to intellectual achievement. However, if this person does not develop this tendency, he will not automatically become a thinker.<br>Similarly, others have leanings towards courage or cowardice. Nevertheless, these are merely tendencies, and they will not manifest themselves unless consciously developed. Also, these tendencies are, at all times, subject to man's control. We are granted free will, and choose our course of behavior.<br>", "Some traits he does not have from birth. He may have learned them from others - In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam writes: \"From his youth, one becomes accustomed to acting in accordance with the accepted behavior of one's family and locale.\" In these few words, the Rambam includes all the people who might influence a person's character development: his parents, siblings, teachers, peers, and others. Also, note Chapter 6, Halachah 1.<br>", "or turned to them on his own. - There are two ways of acquiring such traits<br>", "a) This may have come as a result of his own thoughts - i.e., an intuitive realization of the correctness of a certain course of behavior stemming from one's own creative thought.<br>", "b) or because he heard that this was a proper trait for him, which he ought to attain. - i.e., through study a person understands the value of a certain character trait and sets out to acquire it.<br>", "[Therefore,] he accustomed himself to it until it became a part of himself. - Unlike the inborn or easily acquired traits, these qualities must first be accepted intellectually. Then, through habitual actions, they become part of the personality. (See Halachah 7 for a detailed explanation of such a process of behavioral modification.)<br>"], "Human Dispositions 1.3": ["The two extremes of each trait, which are at a distance from one another, do not reflect a proper path - i.e., the path described in this and the following halachot.<br>", "It is not fitting - except in certain cases, as explained in Chapter 2, Halachah 3.<br>", "that a man should behave in accordance with these extremes - if that his nature<br>", "or teach them to himself - and modify his behavior in this direction.<br>In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam elaborates on this concept, contrasting hedonism with asceticism, and pointing out how neither represents a healthy and mature approach to life.<br>", "If he finds that his nature leans towards one of the extremes - i.e., a genetic trait, as mentioned in the previous halachah<br>", "or adapts itself easily to it - a trait which is easily acquired because of the individual's natural tendencies, as mentioned in the previous halachah.<br>", "or, if he has learned one of the extremes - the third type of trait mentioned in the previous halachah.<br>", "and acts accordingly, he should bring himself back to what is proper - See Chapter 2, Halachah 2, for an extensive description of the process of correcting one's excesses of temperament.<br>", "and walk in the path of the good [men]. - i.e., the path that good men follow. This translation is based on the fact that the word \"path\" is in the singular, while the modifier \"good\" is in the plural.<br>", "That is the straight path. - Perhaps the Rambam is borrowing a biblical phrase here: \"That you walk in the path of the good, and guard the way of the righteous\" (Proverbs 2:20 .<br>The nature of \"the straight path\" is explained in detail in the following halachah.<br>"], "Human Dispositions 1.4": ["The straight path - This expression is also used in <i>Avot</i> 2:1. In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam cites his explanation of the middle path in the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>.<br>", "This [involves discovering] the midpoint temperament of each and every trait that man possesses [within his personality.] - i.e., a path develops out of a series of midpoints.<br>", "This refers to the trait which is equidistant from either of the extremes, without being close to either of them. - These statements echo the opening remarks of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>:<br>The good acts are those balanced ones midway between two extremes. Both of the extremes are bad - one reflects excess and the other, want. The virtues [good traits] are temperaments and habits which are midway between these two bad tendencies.These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits.<br>Despite the similarity between the Rambam's statements here and those quoted, there is a slight difference. Here, the Rambam focuses on good traits, while in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, he emphasizes good actions.<br>", "Therefore, the early Sages instructed a man to evaluate his traits - The Rambam appears to be referring to <i>Sotah</i> 5b: \"Whoever evaluates his paths in this world will merit and witness God's salvation.\"<br>", "to calculate them and to direct them along the middle path - At the conclusion of Chapter 4 of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the Rambam writes:<br>When a man weighs his actions constantly and directs them towards their midpoints, he will be on the most elevated human plane possible. He will thereby approach God and grasp His will. This is the most perfect path in the service of God.<br>Constant introspection is a necessary element in any program of personal and spiritual growth. Even when a person has the highest goals, unless he frequently looks himself squarely in the mirror and examines his behavior, he may make gross errors.<br>", "so that he will be sound {of body}. - We have enclosed the words \"of body\" with brackets because they are not found in authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and are problematic. Though a properly balanced temperament may also lead to physical health, this does not appear to be the Rambam's intent.<br>If the Hebrew <i>bigufo</i> is omitted as suggested, the meaning of <i>shaleim</i> would be altered from \"sound\" to \"complete\" or \"perfect.\"<br>", "For example: he should not be wrathful, easily angered; nor be like the dead, without feeling, rather he should [adopt] an intermediate course; i.e., he should display anger - Our translation is based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3. (Note also the commentary of the <i>Knesset HaGedolah</i>.)<br>", "only when the matter is serious enough to warrant it - The Rambam appears to be referring to matters which evoke personal feelings. Nevertheless, the <i>Misrat Moshe</i> interprets this passage as referring to an instance in which Torah law would require a display of anger - e.g., a colleague's transgression of Torah law.<br>", "in order to prevent the matter from recurring.", "Similarly, he should not desire - This refers to physical desire.<br>", "anything other than that which the body needs and cannot exist without, as [Proverbs 13:25] states - The Rambam quotes supporting verses for only two of the \"intermediate traits;\" perhaps, because his description of the middle-of-the-road position for these traits might appear to veer toward one extreme. We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one's satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist.<br>However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. Deuteronomy 8:10 teaches: \"You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord.\" Based on that verse, <i>Berachot</i> 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism.<br>Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess. This is a dominant theme in the sections on diet in Chapter 4, and those describing the conduct of a Torah sage in Chapter 5.<br>", "\"The righteous man eats to satisfy his soul.\" - The verse continues: \"But the belly of the wicked will want.\" The commentaries note that the contrast between the two does not center on the quantity of food they eat, but on the attitude with which they eat it. Because the righteous are not given over to pursuit of gratification, they can be satisfied. Conversely, it is the gluttony of the wicked which actually causes their want.<br>Note also the Midrashic interpretations of this verse:<br>\"The righteous...\" This refers to Eliezer, who said to Rebecca: \"Let me sip a little water\" (Genesis 24:17  - a single sip.\"And the belly of the wicked will want.\" This refers to Esau, who said to Jacob: \"Stuff me...\" (Genesis 25:30 . Rabbi Yitzchak ben Zeira said: he opened his mouth agape like a camel and said: \"I will open my mouth and you put it in\" (<i>Tanchumah; Pinchas</i> 13; <i>BaMidbar Rabbah</i> 21:18).<br>", "Also, he shall not labor in his business except to gain what he needs for immediate use, as [Psalms 37:16] states: - Here again, the Rambam quotes a Biblical verse, because his definition of an intermediate path may seem extreme. The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one's profession as a means of acquiring possessions.<br>It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note Proverbs 6:6: \"Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;\" and <i>Berachot</i> 8a:<br>He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: \"If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good\" (Psalms 128:2 .\"You are fortunate\" - in this life, and \"will possess the good\" - in the world to come.<br>The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:11. Thus, the Rambam is not criticizing a person for working hard, but rather teaching us that work and its profits should not be our greatest priorities.<br>", "\"A little is good for the righteous man.\" - The verse in its entirety expresses a contrast: \"A little is better for the righteous man than the great wealth that many [of the] wicked possess.\" Note the commentary of ibn Ezra: \"The righteous man will be happier with his small lot than the wicked with their great wealth.\"<br>", "He should not be overly stingy - The printed editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> have <i>yikfotz</i> (close his hand). However, most manuscripts use the term: <i>yikabetz</i> (gather).<br><i>Yikfotz</i> recalls Deuteronomy 15:7: \"Do not close your hand from your needy brother.\" Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. <i>Yikabetz</i>, like <i>vikubatz</i> in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift. The variant texts might reflect a difference of opinion as to which opposing extremes the Rambam had in mind.<br>", "nor spread his money about, but he should give charity according to his capacity - See <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 8:12-13, which places restrictions on the extent of one's generosity.<br><b>and lend to the needy as is fitting -</b> Lending is also a form of charity. In <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 10:7, the Rambam lists eight degrees of charity. The highest is the support of a fellow Jew who has become poor by giving him loans or the like.<br><b>He should not be overly elated and laugh [excessively] -</b> Such expressive \"happiness\" is often a sign of inner discontent and suffering.<br><b>nor be sad and depressed in spirit. Rather, he should be quietly happy at all times -</b> his joy should be a composed sense of satisfaction.<br>[In this context, see the Ramah's conclusion of his notes to <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (697:1) in which he quotes Proverbs 15:15: \"A good-hearted person is always celebrating.\"]<br><b>with a friendly countenance. -</b> In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 1:14, the Rambam defines \"a friendly countenance\" as \"a spirit of will and gentility.\"<br><b>The same applies with regard to his other traits. -</b> In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam mentions many other \"intermediate traits.\" Among them:<br>Courage is the midpoint between arrogance and fear. Humility is the intermediate between pride and meekness. Earnestness is the intermediate between boasting and lowliness....Patience is the intermediate between rashness and insensitivity...<br><b>This path is the path of the wise. -</b> i.e., those whose behavior is controlled by their intellect<br><b>Every man whose traits are intermediate and equally balanced can be called a \"wise man.\" -</b> Note the contrast to the \"pious\" of the following halachah. Though the published editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include this line as the final concept in our halachah, many of the authoritative manuscripts place it as the beginning of Halachah 5.<br>"], "Human Dispositions 1.5": ["A person who carefully [examines] his [behavior] - in an effort to achieve the desired intermediate path<br>", "and therefore, deviates slightly from the mean - to compensate for a possible error in calculating that mean.<br>", "to either side is called pious. - In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam explains that one can refine and correct his behavior by balancing a tendency for excess in one direction by intentionally forcing oneself to adopt the opposite extreme. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.) He continues:<br>Therefore, the pious did not allow themselves to fix their traits at the midpoint, but would bend slightly to the side of excess or want as a hedge and a guard.<br>He goes on to explain that, even for the pious, these extremes are not ends in themselves, but means to help them overcome natural tendencies. Thus, both the pious and a person of underdeveloped character may act in an extreme manner. However, the difference between them is that the behavior of the pious is carefully calculated with the intent of refining his personality, while the underdeveloped person does so without thought, as a natural response to his whims and fancies.<br>", "What is implied? - i.e., how is this concept exemplified?<br>", "One who shuns pride - At first glance, the choice of pride as an example is rather problematic, because in Chapter 2, Halachah 3, the Rambam states:<br>There are traits for which it is forbidden for a person to follow an intermediate path.... Such a trait is pride...The proper path is not that a person should merely be humble, but rather hold himself very lowly...Therefore, our Sages commanded: \"Be very, very humble of spirit.\"<br>It is possible to explain that because of the negative aspects of the quality of pride, the middle path that one should follow in regard to it does not resemble the middle paths of the other traits and may appear as an extreme. Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). See also the commentary on the halachah cited above.<br>Possibly, it is the exaggerated contrasts in this set of traits that make it the most fitting example to demonstrate the principle of the middle path that the Rambam espouses. These gross differences allow for the possibility of clear distinctions.<br>", "and turns to the other extreme - The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> emphasizes that one need not actually adopt the other extreme, but rather, he should tend his behavior in that direction.<br>", "and carries himself lowly is called pious. This is the quality of piety - which represents a deviation from the mean.<br>", "However, if he separates himself [from pride] only to the extent that he reaches the mean and displays humility, he is called wise. This is the quality of wisdom. - In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 5:6, the Rambam contrasts the wise and the pious:<br>A boor is one who lacks both intellectual and ethical development...A wise man possesses both these qualities in a complete way, as is fitting.<i>A pious man is a wise man</i> who increases his piety - i.e., his emotional development - until he tends toward one extreme, as explained in Chapter 4 [of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>], and his deeds exceed his wisdom.<br>Thus, the wise man is one whose ethical behavior has been developed to the point at which it reflects his intellectual sophistication. He is able to appreciate the mean of each trait and express it within the context of his daily life. The pious man also possesses this quality, but due to his desire for ultimate self-refinement, he is willing to sacrifice himself and tend slightly to the extreme in certain instances.<br>Although in this halachah, the Rambam differentiates between the middle path - the path of the wise - and \"beyond the measure of the law\" - the path of the pious, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11 he describes how, \"according to the greatness of the Sage, should be the care he takes to go beyond the measure of the law.\" Thus, it appears that a truly wise man will ultimately seek pious ways.<br>", "The same applies with regard to other character traits. - i.e., there is a mean which is the path of wisdom, and a deviation from that course with a positive intent, which is the path of piety.<br>", "The pious of the early generations - This expression is borrowed - out of context - from the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1.<br>", "would bend their temperaments from the intermediate path towards [either of] the two extremes. For some traits, they would veer towards the final extreme - excess (<i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4)<br>", "for others, towards the first extreme - lack (ibid.). Depending on the circumstances involved, deviation to either extreme can produce positive results.<br>", "This is referred to - by our Sages...<br>", "as [behavior] beyond the measure of the law. - We find this expression used in a number of Talmudic passages. For example, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 30b relates that Rabbi Yishmael, Rabbi Yossi's son, was on a journey. A porter traveling the same road asked him to help lift a load of wood. Rabbi Yishmael was a distinguished scholar, and, therefore, this base task would have been demeaning for him. Nevertheless, rather than refuse the porter entirely, Rabbi Yishmael purchased his entire load from him. This was considered as behavior beyond the measure of the law.<br>See also <i>Berachot</i> 7a and 45b, <i>Bava Kama</i> 100a, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 24b. However, in these and other Talmudic passages where the term is used, the emphasis appears to be on the ethical or legal imperative involved, without stressing the aspect of character development. [Note <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> 11:7, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat</i> 259:3 and 263:3, and <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i> (Positive Commandment 49), which mention our obligation to go beyond the measure of the law.]<br>Thus, the Rambam appears merely to be borrowing the term used by the Sages without referring to any specific instance. The path of behavior prescribed by one's intellect corresponds to law, and an intentional deviation from that course for the sake of piety is \"beyond the measure of the law.\"<br>", "We are commanded - The <i>Sifre</i> (on Deuteronomy 13:5  states: 'You shall walk after God, your Lord' - this is a positive commandment.\" The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ki Tetze</i>, p. 270) also makes a similar statement. However, neither source elaborates.<br>Among the <i>Geonim</i>, the <i>Ba'al Halachot Gedolot</i> does list it as a commandment. Rav Sa'adiah Gaon does not include it as a specific commandment.<br><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 610) include this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. However, the Rambam's inclusion of this commandment as one of the 613 mitzvot is somewhat problematic. In <i>Shoresh</i> 4 of his introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he states that he does not include any \"general mitzvah\" which does not involve a specific activity in his reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. For this reason, \"Observe My statutes\" (Leviticus 19:19  or \"Be holy\" (Leviticus 19:2  are not included in the 613 mitzvot. On the surface, the command the Rambam mentions here also seems to be an all encompassing charge to develop ourselves spiritually without any specific activity.<br>Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, was asked this question, and he explained that here the specific activity implied by this commandment is the development of our emotions and character traits. A somewhat deeper perspective can be gained from the Rambam's own description of the mitzvah. When listing the mitzvot at the beginning of these halachot, he states that the mitzvah is \"to imitate God's ways\" and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he defines the mitzvah as \"to imitate Him, blessed be He, according to our potential.\"<br>The implication of these statements is that man has a constant obligation to carry out all of his deeds and guide the progress of his emotional development with the intent of imitating God. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot, Tavo</i> 5748, and note the commentary on the following halachah.)<br>", "to walk in these intermediate paths - Despite the Rambam's praise of piety, his very description of it as \"beyond the measure of the law\" implies that, though it is desirable, it cannot be considered as obligatory.<br><b>and they are good and straight paths - as [Deuteronomy 28:9] states: \"And you shall walk in His ways.\" -</b> The Rambam describes this mitzvah in the following halachah. Indeed, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include the paragraph we have just explained as the beginning of Halachah 6.As emphasized in the introduction to this text, the Rambam has structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intent of \"revealing all the laws to the great and to the small with regard to each and every mitzvah.\" He does not mention philosophical and ethical concepts unless they are halachot - i.e., practical directives for our behavior.<br>In this context, we can understand the structure of this chapter. The Rambam set out to describe the mitzvah of following God's ways. As stated in this halachah, he perceives this to mean developing our personalities by emulating the qualities which the Creator reveals. As he states in the following halachah, those qualities are identical with the middle path of human behavior. Therefore, in the initial halachot of this chapter, the Rambam sets out to describe the nature of human personality and the ideal temperaments - the middle path - that man should seek to achieve. Having laid down this foundation, he is able to define that mitzvah in this halachah and begin offering directives for its fulfillment in Halachah 7.<br><b>[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah -</b> The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (Exodus 14:2  and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.<br>It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:<br>[Deuteronomy 13:5 states]: \"You shall walk after God, your Lord.\" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: \"Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire\" (Deuteronomy 4:24 ?Rather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.Just as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;God visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;God comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;God buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God's deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.<br>There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.<br>Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the \"resemblance of God\" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.<br><b>Just as He is called \"Gracious,\" you shall be gracious; Just as He is called \"Merciful,\" you shall be merciful; Just as He is called \"Holy,\" you shall be holy; -</b> Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is \"piety.\" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.<br><b>In a similar manner, the prophets -</b> The Rambam's choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent.<br><b>called God by other titles: \"Slow to anger,\" \"Abundant in kindness,\" \"Righteous,\" \"Just,\" \"Perfect,\" \"Almighty,\" \"Powerful,\" and the like. -</b> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:11-12 and in detail in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (Guide to the Perplexed), Vol. I, Chapters 53 and 54, the Rambam explains that these names are not descriptions of God, who cannot be defined by any specific quality. To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.<br>Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as \"slow to anger.\" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent.<br><b>[They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths. -</b> i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve.<br><b>A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (ibid.) states that with the latter phrase, the Rambam is adding a new thought. As explained above, God cannot be described by any particular quality. If He manifests a quality, it is for a specific intent.<br></b><br><b>In <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (ibid., Chapter 54), the Rambam mentions that the leader of a country should act in a similar manner.<br></b><br><b>Sometimes he will be merciful and generous to some people - not because of his feelings and natural compassion, but because they are deserving of such treatment.Sometimes he will bear a grudge, seek revenge, and rage against certain people - not out of feelings of anger... - but in order to produce positive results....The ultimate ideal man can achieve is to imitate God according to his potential... i.e., to have our deeds resemble His deeds.<br></b><br>For this reason, human behavior should not be motivated by the spontaneous expression of emotion. Rather, man's emotions should arise as the result of a deliberate process of thought.<br>This reflects themes brought out in the previous halachot of this chapter: that a person must constantly evaluate and review his emotions (Halachah 4); that it is a wise man who is able to appreciate the middle path (Halachah 5).<br>This is what is meant by the imitation of God: that a person not be controlled by the unchecked expression of his emotions. Rather, he should control his feelings and, motivated by his desire to resemble God, search to find the correct and proper quality, the middle path, appropriate to the situation at hand.<br>to the extent of his ability. - for man is ultimately finite in nature, and no true resemblance to God is possible.<br><b>How can one train himself to follow these temperaments to the extent that they become a permanent fixture of his [personality]? -</b> Having established personality development as a mitzvah in the previous halachah, the Rambam begins his explanation of how this mitzvah is fulfilled.<br><b>He should perform - repeat - and perform a third time -</b> Thus, a person's deeds will shape his character traits.<br>In this process of personal change, the stress is on the repetition of an act, and not on its quantity or intensity. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 3:15, the Rambam writes that giving a thousand coins to one person at one time is not as effective in stimulating feelings of generosity as giving a single coin one thousand times.<br>As mentioned in Halachah 4, though the Rambam's explanations in this chapter parallel those of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the texts differ in stressing actions (as the opening lines of that chapter imply), or on character development, which is the theme of our text.<br>For this reason, the two texts also perceive the process of causation differently. In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam states: \"These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits,\" while here he sees the traits being produced by the actions.<br>Nevertheless, the two texts do not actually contradict each other. Both statements are true. Our deeds reflect our personalities, and they also help shape those personalities. Generally, this means that a person's behavior will reinforce and strengthen the character traits that motivated those very deeds. However, this chapter - and more particularly, this halachah - deals with a person who has made a commitment to change and refine his character. Therefore - based on his intellect and the directives of the Torah, rather than his spontaneous feelings - he chooses to perform deeds that will bring about this process of inner change.<br><b>which conform to -</b> reflect and are motivated by...<br><b>the standards of the middle road temperaments -</b> described in Halachot 4 and 5.<br><b>He should do this constantly, until these acts are easy for him and do not present any difficulty. -</b> A trait possessed by a person produces activities naturally and spontaneously. However, if one has not acquired a trait as yet, certain actions will be foreign to his nature, and one must trouble himself to perform them.<br>For example, a liberal man gives charity naturally; the miser must force himself to give. The action for each is the same, but not the inner feelings.<br><b>Then, these temperaments will become a fixed part of his personality. -</b> If the miser continues to give frequently, he will find that he no longer feels like a miser, but has become liberal in heart as well as in hand.<br><b>Since the Creator -</b> The Rambam uses the term <i>yotzer</i> - literally \"the One who forms\" - (which appears only one other time in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:7).<br>The Rambam describes God as the Creator with reference to the Divine qualities he describes in these halachot. Before the existence of the world and man, there would be no purpose for God to reveal these qualities, for until man's creation, no one could learn from or emulate them.<br>[The word <i>yotzer</i> may also be used because of its connection to the word <i>yeitzer</i>, meaning drive or inclination. (See Rashi, Genesis 2:7.)]<br><b>is called by these terms and they make up the middle path which we are obligated to follow, this path is called \"the path of God.\" -</b> As stated in the commentary on the previous halachah, \"the path of God\" involves controlling our emotions by using our intellect, so that our behavior is, to the extent that is possible for man, an objective response to a situation. In this manner, our behavior bears a resemblance to God's transcendence of worldly matters.<br><b>This is [the heritage] which our Patriarch Abraham taught his descendants -</b> See the <i>Midrash Tanchumah, Shofetim</i> 15:<br>And what are the ways of God? Righteousness and justice, as it is stated: \"And they will keep the path of God to do righteousness and justice\" (Genesis 18:19 .<br><b>as [Genesis 18:19] states: \"for I have known Him so that he will command his descendants...to keep the path of God.\" -</b> Since the path of God is mentioned in the context of Abraham's service, it appears that walking in those ways is not synonymous with the performance of the 613 commandments - for they had not been given in Abraham's time. Rather, it must refer to ethics, qualities like righteousness and justice, which are mentioned in that verse.<br><b>One who follows this path brings benefit and blessing to himself, as [the above verse continues]: \"so that God will bring about for Abraham all that He promised.\" -</b> The Rambam concludes his description of the obligation to develop our characters with the assurance that, ultimately, this course of behavior will bring us benefit and blessing."], "Human Dispositions 1.6": ["[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah - The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.).

According to the Rambam, who maintains that the requirement of tzitzit on these garments is Rabbinic in origin, we must assume that these concepts were part of the Rabbinic ordinance requiring tzitzit for these garments (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "the white strands should be made from the same fabric as the garment itself. - The authorities who consider the obligation to attach tzitzit to such garments as stemming from the Torah explain that, in the commandment to attach tzitzit, the Torah mentions the word \"corner\" an extra time, to teach that the tzitzit should be made of the same fabric as the corners.<br>", "For example, silk strands should be used for a silk garment, strands of goats' wool should be used for garments of goats' wool. - If one chooses to make tzitzit from these fabrics, one should use them for all four tzitzit.

Therefore, whenever tzitzit are made, either of these two fabrics may be used.<br>", "because [strands of] wool and linen can fulfill the obligation [of tzitzit] for garments made of their own fabric or for garments made of other fabrics. - Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg maintains, however, that wool and linen strands alone are not sufficient, and only a combination of wool and linen including strands of <i>techelet</i> can be used to fulfill the obligation of tzitzit for garments made from other fabrics. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 9:4 suggests considering this opinion.<br>", "In contrast, [strands made] from other fabrics can fulfill the obligation [of tzitzit] only for garments made of their own fabric. - Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 9:5 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 9:10,13 which discuss a situation where the garment is woven from both wool and another fabric.<br>"], "Fringes 3.6": ["What is the ruling regarding making woolen strands for a garment of linen or linen strands for a garment of wool - even though we are speaking only of the white strands without techelet? - It appears that the Rambam is asking about attaching tzitzit that have only white strands, without attaching <i>techelet</i>. Thus, one can conclude that when attaching tzitzit to a linen garment, it is forbidden to make the white strands of wool even though one includes a woolen strand of<i>techelet</i>. Though the prohibition against <i>sha'atnez</i> is lifted for this garment, it is lifted only when there is no alternative but to do so (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "One might think that it should be permitted, because sha'atnez - a mixture of wool and linen which is forbidden.

If not, the observance of the positive commandment supersedes the negative commandment. - Rav Nissim Gaon explains that although the violation of a negative commandment receives a more severe punishment than the failure to observe a positive commandment, when God originally gave the negative commandments, He prescribed that they do not apply when adherence to them causes the performance of a positive commandment to be nullified.<br>The <i>Tanya</i> (<i>Iggeret HaTeshuvah</i>, Chapter 1) explains the rationale for this principle. Man's purpose in this world is to spread Godly light through the observance of mitzvot. Accordingly, the observance of these mitzvot is always given preference when there is such a conflict.<br>It must be emphasized that one must fulfill the mitzvah at the time one is violating the transgression.

Surely this applies in the present instance, when the mitzvah of tzitzit is not nullified entirely.<br>", "[imposed] lest one wear the garment at night - Significantly, the Rambam does not quote his apparent source (<i>Menachot</i> 40b) exactly. The Talmud states \"lest one wear a garment of the night.\" The Rambam's change of phraseology teaches two concepts. First, that not only a garment which is generally worn at night, but even one which is worn primarily during the day, should not have <i>techelet</i> attached to it, lest one wear it during the night.<br>This also sheds light on a more involved issue. There is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis if the exclusion of wearing tzitzit at night applies to all tzitzit, or if it applies only to garments which are worn primarily at night. According to the latter opinion, garments worn primarily at night do not require tzitzit, even when worn during the day. In contrast, a garment which is worn primarily during the day requires tzitzit, even during the night and one does not transgress the prohibition against <i>sha'atnez</i> when wearing it at that time.<br>By altering the terminology used by the Talmud, the Rambam indicates his acceptance of the first perspective. Rabbenu Asher is the primary exponent of the second position. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 18:1) mentions both views without reaching a conclusion.<br>", "when one is not required to wear tzitzit, and thus violate a negative commandment when the performance of a positive commandment is not involved. - See <i>Hilchot Kilayim</i> 10:32, which mentions a similar concept regarding the priestly garments. The sash worn by the priests was made from <i>sha'atnez</i>. Therefore, the priests were allowed to wear it only when they were actually involved in the Temple service. Wearing it at other times constitutes a transgression, and not a mitzvah.<br>Significantly, Rabbenu Tam differs with the Rambam and allows the sash and tzitzit to be worn even during the times when doing so does not fulfill a mitzvah.<br>", "[This is because] the obligation to wear tzitzit applies during the day, but not at night [as can be inferred from Numbers 15:39]: \"And you shall see them.\" - Note the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 8:13, which states that this verse also implies that one should wear tzitzit in a manner in which the strands can be seen.<br>", "[The mitzvah applies only] during a time when one can see. - i.e., the daytime hours.

Nevertheless, because of Rabbenu Asher's opinion mentioned in the previous halachah, if someone slept in his <i>tallit katan</i>, he should not recite a blessing upon it in the morning. Instead, it is preferable that he recite the blessing over his <i>tallit gadol</i> with the intention of including the <i>tallit katan</i> (<i>Mishneh Berurah</i> 8:24).<br>", "When [the sun has risen so] that one can differentiate between the strands of techelet and those which are white. - This time is slightly more than midway between dawn (\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05d7\u05e8) and sunrise (\u05d4\u05e0\u05e5 \u05d4\u05d7\u05de\u05d4).<br>Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 18:3), who allows the blessing to be recited from dawn onwards.<br>", "Which blessing should be recited upon it? \"Blessed are you, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to wrap ourselves with tzitzit.\" - This is the blessing recited over the <i>tallit gadol</i>.

Therefore, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, at the conclusion of the listing of the positive commandments, he lists tzitzit (together with tefillin) as one of the positive commandments whose observance we must pursue.

If throwing the staff is not comparable to sprinkling blood, why is one held liable for it? Accordingly, some commentaries have explained that this decision applies only when the deity is worshiped by throwing staffs. The <i>Pri Chadash</i>, however, differentiates between the liability of the worshiper (for which a sprinkling that spatters is not required) and the prohibition of the worship of the deity (for which it is).<br>", "because throwing a staff is not considered equivalent to sprinkling blood. The staff remains as it was - a single whole entity<br>", "while the blood spatters [in different directions]. - Since the reason that these services are considered significant even though the deity is not normally worshiped in this manner is that these services were performed in the Temple, the analogy must be complete.

Hence, he is not punished by the court for his deed, nor is he obligated for <i>karet</i> by God. Since he, nevertheless, did perform an act of worship to these gods, he must bring a sacrifice for atonement.<br>The above represents the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> interpretation of this halachah. Many other authorities (see <i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> 64a) disagree, and maintain that even in such circumstances, one could be held liable for capital punishment. For example, two witnesses who knew the law were present and warned the person against repudiating the idol in this fashion. He ignored their warning and performed the derisive act of worship. Although his intent was not to serve the deity, since he performed an act of worship despite the warning he was given, he is liable for execution.<br>Rav Kapach brings support for the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> view from the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:6. There, the Rambam discusses a similar situation and states that a person who performs such service \"is liable for a sin offering.\" In the original texts of that commentary, the Rambam stated that the person \"is liable.\" The addition of the words \"for a sin offering\" appear to indicate that he is liable only for an offering, but not for punishment by the court. Note also <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:4, where the Rambam states that a person who unknowingly worships a false god is not liable for his deeds.<br>"], "Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.6": ["[The following rules apply when] a person serves a false deity out of love - i.e., he desires an image because its service is very attractive - The commentaries note that the Rambam interprets \"out of love\" differently from \"out of fear.\" \"Out of love\" refers to a love for the image and its service, while \"out of fear\" means fear of what the deity can do to the person.<br>Rav Kapach explains the Rambam's position, justifying the need for such a difference in interpretation. Most idolaters do not worship their images out of a genuine conviction that they are the true god, but rather for the benefit they feel this service will bring them. Therefore, were a person to serve an idol with this intent in mind, the Rambam would hold him liable. In contrast, were he to serve out of fear, he is not considered to be acting on his own volition, and hence is not held responsible.<br>", "or when one serves it out of his fear of it - i.e., he fears that it will harm him - as the [idol] worshipers fear [their deities as sources of] benefit and harm: - See Chapter 1, Halachot 1-2.<br>", "If he accepts it as a god - and serves it as an act of worship<br>", "he is liable to be stoned to death - as stated in Halachah 1.<br>", "If he serves it out of love or fear - without accepting it as a god - even though he served it<br>", "through its accepted mode of service - as mentioned in Halachah 2<br>", "or through one of the four services [mentioned above] - in Halachah 3,<br>", "he is not held liable - since he did not accept the deity as a god.<br>Although the Rambam's opinion is questioned by many other authorities, it is based on an established tradition of Talmudic interpretation. This halachah is based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 61b. That passage is also quoted in <i>Shabbat</i> 72b. Rabbenu Chanan'el, one of the foremost commentators in the generations between the Geonim and the Rambam, interprets the latter passage using the same concepts _ and almost the same phraseology _ as employed by the Rambam here.<br>The Ra'avad and others challenge the Rambam's interpretation and explain that \"out of love\" and \"out of fear\" mean: motivated by the love or fear of the person who tries to influence one to worship the false deity. The Rambam cannot accept this interpretation, because in <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 5:4, he states that a person who is forced to serve false gods is not held liable for his deeds (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The fact that a person is not held liable for such service does not at all minimize the seriousness of the prohibition involved. In no way is one allowed to serve false gods for such reasons. Even with regard to the Ra'avad's interpretation \"out of fear\" - i.e., out of fear of a person - the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 150:3) prohibits performing any act that might be interpreted as idol worship - e.g., bowing to a ruler who is wearing an image.<br>", "One who embraces a false deity, kisses it, sweeps before it, mops before it, washes it, anoints it, dresses it, places shoes upon it, or performs any similar act of deference violates a negative commandment, as [implied by Exodus 20:5]: \"Do not serve them.\" - This commandment is described in Halachot 2 and 3.<br>", "Such acts are also \"service.\" The offender is, nevertheless, not - executed, as is one who worships a false deity, nor is he<br>", "punished by lashes, because [these services] are not [mentioned] explicitly [by the Torah]. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that punishment is not given because this prohibition is a \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5 \u05e9\u05d1\u05db\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea - i.e., it includes many different forbidden acts. Lashes are not given for the violation of such a prohibition, as stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3.<br>To explain: The prohibition, \"Do not serve them,\" is twofold in nature. It prohibits the worship of a false deity through its accepted modes of service, as stated in Halachah 2. This is a sin punishable by death. The same prohibition also forbids these expressions of affection or reverence. These deeds are not, however, punishable by death because they are not acts of worship.<br>Since violation of this prohibition incurs a penalty of execution, it is not associated with the punishment of lashes. Since, in essence, this prohibition is not associated with lashes, even the many transgressions of a lesser nature which are also included within this prohibition are also not punishable in this manner (Rav Kapach).<br>", "If one of the above services - kissing, and the like<br>", "was the accepted mode of worship [of a particular deity] and a person performed this service as an act of worship - and not merely as an expression of emotion. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the addition of the words \"as an act of worship,\" noting that in Halachah 5, the Rambam holds one liable for performing the service with which Pe'or or Marculis was worshiped, even though one's intent was to repudiate the idols. Thus, it appears that once a person performs a service which is the accepted mode of worship, his intent is no longer significant.<br>The <i>Pri Chadash</i> resolves this difficulty, explaining that the extent of liability is different. In the previous halachah, the offender was liable for a sin offering alone, while here,<br>", "he is liable [for execution] - as stated in Halachah 2.<br>"], "Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.7": ["If a splinter becomes stuck in a person's foot before an idol, he should not bend down to remove it, because it appears that he is bowing down to the idol. - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 12a states that if the person turns his back or side to the idol, his bowing would not be considered to be an act of deference, and no prohibition is involved.<br>", "Even if no other people are present, this and the following prohibitions apply. Any prohibition that was instituted because of the impression which might be created (\u05de\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05ea \u05e2\u05d9\u05df) is forbidden even in a person's most private chambers.<br>", "If money belonging to a person becomes scattered before an idol, he should not bow down and pick it up, because it appears that he is bowing down to the idol. - From the commentaries' discussion of this law, it appears that if the person does bow down, he is not held liable for his actions. <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> questions the difference between this decision and Halachah 5, which holds a person who throws a stone to Marculis with the intent to repudiate it liable for a sin offering. He resolves that difficulty, explaining that in Halachah 5, the person intended to throw the stone at the idol. Since that act constitutes worship of this deity, he is held liable. In contrast, in our halachah the person did not bow down to the idol at all. The only reason the bowing is prohibited is that a mistaken impression might be created.<br>", "Instead, he should sit down, and then pick it up. - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> (ibid.) mentions a third prohibition, that a person should not bow down to drink from a spring that flows in front of an idol. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that Rav Yitzchak Alfasi also omits this law, and explains that it was not contained in their text of the Talmud. (This is somewhat unlikely, since it is found in Rabbenu Chanan'el's text of <i>Avodah Zarah</i>.)<br>", "The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1389) states that this law is included in the law mentioned in the following halachah. Hence, it is not mentioned explicitly by the Rambam."], "Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.8": ["that he is kissing the false deity. - This prohibition is also mentioned in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> (ibid.).<br>The commentaries have noted a slight difficulty in the Talmud's (and thus, the Rambam's) phraseology.

Accordingly, he is not punished by execution as above. He is, nevertheless, considered to have violated a prohibition, and<br>", "is [liable for] lashes - The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions this statement, noting that lashes are not given for a transgression which does not involve a deed, and that speech is not ordinarily considered to be a deed. He explains that since the craftsman fashions the idol on behalf of the person who commissioned him, he is considered to be the latter's agent. Therefore, the one who commissioned him is held responsible for his deed.<br>The commentaries question this explanation, noting that - with the exception of a few specific instances - the Torah never holds a person who commissions another individual to commit a sin liable, since the person who actually committed the sin is responsible for his actions. Also, the Rambam's phraseology here implies that one is held liable regardless whether the craftsman is a Jew or gentile, and a gentile is never given the halachic status of an agent.<br>The following are among the resolutions offered to this difficulty:a) A hired worker's actions - whether positive or negative - are always attributed to his employer (<i>Machaneh Efrayim, Hilchot Shutafim</i> 8).b) The verse prohibiting this act reveals that this is one of the few exceptions to the general rule mentioned above, and in this case, the person who commissioned the agent is held liable (<i>Darchei HaMelech</i>).c) Commenting on <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 13:2, the <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> explains that if it is possible to violate a particular prohibition by committing a deed, one is punished by lashes even when one violates it without committing a deed. The same concept can be applied here (<i>S'deh Chemed</i>).d) The deed for which one is punished is not the command to make the idol, but rather its purchase or acquisition (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>, Alfandari).<br>", "as [Exodus 20:5] states: \"Do not make for yourself an idol or any representation.\" - The grammatical structure of this verse allows it to be interpreted, \"Do not have an idol... made for you.\" <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 2) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 27) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>", "Similarly, a person who actually fashions a false god for others, even for - gentile<br>", "idolaters - even when he merely acts as a craftsman and does not worship or believe in the idol himself.<br>", "is [liable for] lashes, as [Leviticus 19:4] states: \"Do not make molten gods for yourselves.\" - <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 3) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 214) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>", "Accordingly, a person who actually fashions a false god for himself - violates both of the above prohibitions. Therefore, he<br>", "receives two measures of lashes. - See <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 17:4 for a description of how punishment is administered when a person is liable for more than one measure of lashes.<br>"], "Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.10": ["It is prohibited to make images for decorative purposes, even though they do not represent false deities - i.e., they were made as decorations and works of art, without any intent that they be worshiped.<br>", "as [implied by Exodus 20:23]: \"Do not make with Me [gods of silver and gods of gold].\" - <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 4) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 39) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>", "This refers even to images of gold and silver which are intended only for decorative purposes, lest others err and view them as deities. - The Rambam's statement sheds light on an interesting Rabbinic debate. The Sages of the Talmud often established \"fences around the Torah\" - i.e., safeguards to prevent the violation of Torah law. (See <i>Avot</i> 1:1.) There is a question whether the Torah itself instituted prohibitions for such a purpose - i.e., are there mitzvot that are instituted without a self-contained goal of their own, but merely to prevent the violation of other prohibitions? (See <i>Lekach Tov</i> 8.)<br>From the Rambam's statements here (see also <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 7:8), it appears that he accepts such a premise. It appears that there is nothing intrinsically wrong in making statues per se. Nevertheless, since if such statues are made, the possibility exists that they may be worshiped, the Torah forbids us to make them.<br>", "It is forbidden to make decorative images of the human form alone. - As explained in the following halachah, this prohibition also applies to the sun, the moon, and other celestial beings. It is permitted to make an image of all creations of our world aside from man.<br><i>Avodah Zarah</i> 43b derives this from the above verse. The Hebrew words translated as \"Do not make with Me...\" can also be rendered, \"Do not make Me...\" - i.e., do not make images in the human form, the form in which God has revealed himself (<i>Siftei Cohen, Yoreh De'ah</i> 141:21).<br>", "Therefore, it is forbidden to make human images with wood, cement, or stone - or any other material. The Rambam mentioned these materials because they were commonly used in his time.<br>", "This [prohibition] applies when the image is protruding - for example, images and sculptures made in a hallway and the like. - The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 141) states that we are forbidden to make only a complete human statue. A bust of a head alone or a statue which is lacking any one of the body's limbs is not forbidden. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (141:7) does not accept this view, it is shared by the Ramah.<br>", "A person who makes such an image is [liable for] lashes - but not by execution, since these statues were not worshiped as idols.<br>", "In contrast, it is permitted to make human images that are engraved or painted - e.g., portraits, whether on wood or on stone - or that are part of a tapestry. - Though the images on a tapestry protrude slightly, since they are not a fully formed statue, there is no prohibition involved in making them. Note the contrast to the prohibition against making images of the celestial beings mentioned in the following halachah and commentary.<br>"], "Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.11": ["[The following rules apply regarding] a signet ring - In ancient times, it was customary for rulers to seal their documents with a signet ring. (See Esther 8:8.) Wax would be poured on the document and the ring pressed into the wax, producing an imprint which is a reverse image of that on the ring.<br>", "which bears a human image: If the image is protruding, it is forbidden to wear it - on one's finger, because a protruding image is forbidden, as stated in the previous halachah.<br>", "but it is permitted to use it as a seal - for the human image it produces is sunken into the wax.<br>", "If the image is an impression, it is permitted to wear it - because there is not prohibition against such a human image<br>", "but it is forbidden to use it as a seal, because it will create an image which protrudes - which is forbidden.<br>", "Similarly, it is forbidden to make an image of the sun, the moon, the stars, the constellations - Our understanding of the Rambam's statements here can be enhanced by referring to his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:3:<br>This does not mean a sphere which represents the sun or a hemisphere which represents the moon, but rather the images which the astrologers [i.e., those following Greek mythology] attribute to the stars,... e.g., Saturn is represented as an old dark man of venerable age, Venus is represented as a a beautiful maiden adorned with gold, and the sun is represented as a king with a diadem sitting in a chariot.[These are forbidden because] they are falsehoods and the nature of falsehood is that it will surely spread.<br>Rav Kapach supports this interpretation by quoting <i>BeMidbar Rabbah</i> 2:6, which describes the pennant of the tribe of Issachar as having a picture of the sun and the moon. Were these images forbidden, it would be unlikely that Moshe would have told the tribe to depict them. Even if the decree was instituted in the later generations, it is not probable that the Rabbis would forbid images that had previously been used for a Torah purpose.<br>The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 141:3) quotes the Rambam's opinion. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 141:13 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 141:8, however, note that the Rambam's statements which were quoted above (and the Ramah's statements) refer to a question whether one is allowed to keep images of the sun or moon that he finds. Here, the question is whether one is allowed to make such images oneself. From the discussion of the question in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 43b, where the Sages question how Rabban Gamliel possessed forms of the moon, it would appear that there is a prohibition against making images of the sun and the moon themselves.<br>This interpretation, however, is also somewhat problematic, because the Rambam writes that there is no prohibition against making images of animals, and some of the constellations of the Zodiac are represented and referred to as animals. For example, one of the Zodiac constellations is a fish and <i>Gittin</i> 36a describes Rav as making a drawing of a fish. Another is a lion, which is one of the most popular images found in Jewish art.<br>", "or the angels - As the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:3-5, the angels have no body or form. Hence, here, he is obviously referring to a form which a man has conceived of as appropriate for a particular angel. Alternatively, it could refer to the metaphoric imagery used by the prophets.<br>", "as [implied by Exodus, ibid.]: \"Do not make with Me [gods of silver...]\" - The Rambam (quoting <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.) mentions the above Biblical proof-text in connection with this prohibition. It would appear, however, from the fact that making such images is not punishable by lashes, that the prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature. The reference to the verse must be understood as an <i>asmachta</i> (use of the Biblical verse as a support for a Rabbinic decree).<br>", "i.e., do not make images of - those who are \"with Me\" - i.e.,<br>", "My servants, those who serve before Me on high. _ This refers to the celestial beings and the angels. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 1, and <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:3.)<br>", "This [prohibition] - is more severe than the prohibition against making human images, and<br>", "applies even [to pictures] on tablets. - According to the Rambam's statements in his Commentary on the Mishnah, the difference between the prohibition against making these images and those of humans can be explained as follows: The prohibition against making human statues is Biblical in origin and is defined by the Torah itself. In contrast, the prohibition of making images of the celestial beings was a safeguard instituted by the Rabbis against Greek and Roman culture. It, therefore, applies to all images, whether pictures or statues, because both could influence people to stray from the Torah's ways.<br>According to the simple interpretation of the terms \"sun\" and \"moon,\" the difference can be explained as follows: The sun and the moon, as we perceive them, appear against the background of the sky. Therefore, for a representation of them to be forbidden, it also need not protrude (<i>Tosafot, 14Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.).<br>", "The images of animals and other living beings - with the exception of men - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 42b also mentions a prohibition against making the image of a <i>d'rakon</i> which Rashi and others interpret as an animal similar to a serpent.", "In his Commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), the Rambam describes this image as a fishlike man with fins and many scales, probably referring to the Greek god Neptune.", "and similarly, the images of trees, grasses, and the like may be fashioned. This - leniency<br>", "applies even to images which protrude. - From these two halachot, particularly according to the Rambam's understanding as reflected in his Commentary on the Mishnah, we see that there is no conflict between Torah law and aesthetics. There are only two restrictions: realistic human statues (and according to some authorities, these must be complete, full-bodied statues) and depictions of pagan gods. Even according to the other opinions which forbid depictions of the sun, the moon, and the like, there is no prohibition against abstract portrayals of these entities. No other restrictions apply at all.<br>There is definitely a divergence between the approach to life that spawned much of the art forms of Western culture and a Torah lifestyle. Perhaps for that reason, many religious Jews have traditionally shunned participation in and patronage of the arts. In the present generation, however, a number of our Torah leaders have urged religious artists to dedicate themselves to expressing Torah ideas and values in a variety of art forms, explaining that:a) Through these media, it is possible to reach many Jews who might never enter a synagogue or Torah center;b) Everything in the world was created to be used by the Jews for a Torah purpose (Rashi, Genesis 1:1 . This also applies to art. Using these art forms for Torah purposes expresses the true intent for their creation and endows them with a depth of meaning and inspiration - and in its deepest sense, a new wellspring of creativity.<br>According to Kabbalah, God's presence is more manifest in the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Tiferet</i> (\"Beauty\") than in any other <i>sefirah</i>. Thus, the challenge confronting a Torah artist today is to use beauty as a medium to express Godly truth.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.1": ["Wherever ten Jews live - Since communal prayer is impossible without a quorum of ten, this is the minimum number of people that must live in a community before constructing a synagogue becomes obligatory.<br>", "it is necessary to establish a place for them to congregate for prayer at the time of each prayer service. - Note <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 4:23, which states that a Torah sage is not allowed to live in a city which lacks any of ten community resources, one of which is a synagogue.<br>", "This place is called a Beit K'nesset - literally, \"a house of congregation,\" generally, translated as \"synagogue.\"<br>", "The inhabitants of a city can compel each other - The Ramah (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 163:1) states that even if the majority of the inhabitants do not desire the construction of a synagogue, the minority have the right to compel them to build it.<br>", "to construct - i.e., participate both financially and in the actual construction work, if necessary,<br>", "a synagogue and to purchase scrolls containing the Torah, the Prophets, and the Sacred Writings. - so that these texts will be available for Torah study (<i>Hilchot Sh'chenim</i> 6:1).

However, if the roofs are slanted and therefore, will not be used by people, the height of the other buildings may exceed that of the synagogue. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 150:2) states that apartments or offices in other buildings should also not be higher than the synagogue's roof.<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 150:5 notes that many communities are not stringent in the observance of this law and quotes sources which explain that since buildings owned by gentiles are often taller than the synagogue, the synagogue is not likely to be the tallest building in the city in any case. Therefore, other Jewish houses may also be built higher than the synagogue. His own opinion, however, is not to seek leniency in this regard.<br>", "The entrance to the synagogue should open only on the east [as implied by Numbers 3:38]: \"...And those who camped before - The word \"before\" is understood to mean \"at the entrance to.\"<br>", "the sanctuary on the east.\" - This law is quoted from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>). The <i>Tur</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 150:5) explain that this law applied only in Babylon, where their synagogues faced west. Thus, the doorway on the eastern side would be opposite the ark. However, since the Rambam mentions the possibility of the <i>heichal</i> being built on different walls, but mentions only one position for the entrance, it appears that he requires the entrance to be placed at the east at all times.<br>", "In [the synagogue], a heichal, where the Torah scroll is placed, should be constructed. - This refers to a fixed structure like the ark (<i>Aron HaKodesh</i>) which is found in contemporary synagogues.

Since these activities are accepted in one's home, they are also acceptable in the synagogue.<br>It must be noted that many authoritative manuscripts of the<i>Mishneh Torah</i> omit the phrases \"wearing [only] lower garments\" and \"with dust on his feet.\" Note also the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 151:8) which states that a person should clean mud from his shoes before entering a synagogue.<br>", "If it is necessary for him to spit, he may spit in the synagogue. - Rabbenu Manoach cites the following statement from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 3:5):<br>A person who spits in the synagogue is considered like one who spits in [God's] eye. Rabbi Yonah would spit and wipe it with his foot.<br>Rabbenu Manoach explains that this passage does not contradict the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) which allows one to spit in the synagogue. As long as Rabbi Yonah's practice is followed, there is no prohibition.<br>Though some authorities disagree, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 151:7) accepts Rabbenu Manoach's decision. However, while reciting the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, spitting is forbidden (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 97:2). The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 151:9 mentions that the <i>Ari zal</i> would refrain from spitting within a synagogue.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.11": ["Synagogues and houses of study that have been destroyed remain holy [as can be inferred from Leviticus 26:31]: \"I will destroy your sanctuaries.\" - The commentaries explain that since the verse states \u05d5\u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d0\u05ea \u05de\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d9\u05db\u05dd, with the noun \"sanctuaries\" following the verb \"I will destroy,\" rather than 18\u05dd\u05db\u05d9\u05e9\u05d3\u05e7\u05de\u00e1\u05ea\u05d0\u05d5 \u05dd\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d0, one may draw the following inference.<br>", "[Our Sages explained]: Even though they are destroyed, they remain - sanctuaries and therefore, must be regarded as<br>", "holy. - Therefore,<br>", "Just as one must treat them with respect while they are standing, - as explained in Halachot 5-10.<br>", "so must they be treated [with respect] when they are destroyed - <i>Megillah</i> 28b mentions that if one constructed a synagogue with the condition that it can be used for mundane purposes, one may do so.

Thus, were a synagogue to be built with such a condition, as were the synagogues in Babylonia in Talmudic times, mundane activities could be carried on within its premises after it was destroyed. However, even then, activities directly opposed to the sanctity of the synagogue, e.g., sowing crops on the land, are forbidden.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 151:11) quotes <i>Tosafot's</i> opinion.

The published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (which we have quoted) appears to imply that one should pull them out (i.e., it is imperative to do so). However, the version of the halachah found in authoritative manuscripts is closer to the understanding in the Commentary to the Mishnah.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:10) quotes the version of the halachah in the published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.

Two reasons are mentioned by the Talmud. The Rambam quotes one:<br>", "lest unforeseen difficulties arise [which prevent it] from being built. - The second reason mentioned in the Talmud is so that people will have a place to pray in the interim. The Talmud notes that different corollaries result from these two explanations. If there is another synagogue in the city, according to the second explanation (not mentioned by the Rambam), one could tear down the first synagogue while building a new one, since people would be able to pray in the other synagogue in the interim. However, according to the explanation quoted by the Rambam, it would be improper to destroy the synagogue lest the new synagogue never be built.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 152:1) quotes the Rambam's decision. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 152:4 states that this law applies even if all the money necessary to build the new synagogue has been collected.<br>", "This applies even to a single wall of [a synagogue]. One should build the new wall next to the old wall and then, tear down the old wall. - The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> (152) mentions the opinion of Rabbenu Asher who permits a community to enlarge a synagogue by tearing down an existing wall before building a new one if there is no other alternative.

[It is even forbidden] to sell an old scroll in order to purchase a new one.

Alternatively, he may be referring to circumstances where the new Torah scroll has already been written and all that is necessary is to pay for it.

Despite this limitation, the congregation may use these funds for another purpose associated with a mitzvah and substitute other funds to accomplish the purpose for which these funds were originally collected.

According to this understanding, a synagogue in a small village where large trade fairs are held is bound by the same laws as the synagogues of a large city. By the same token, a synagogue used by a private group of people in a large city may be comparable to a village synagogue.

Therefore, they have the right to sell the synagogue for whatever purposes they wish.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision and maintains that the license granted by <i>Megillah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) only applies to the money received from the sale, while the building that was used as a synagogue can never be used for a purpose which is unbecoming. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) quotes the Rambam's view, the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> suggests following the Ra'avad's decision, quoting the law (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 21:2), which forbids using a <i>tallit</i> for an unbecoming purpose even after its <i>tzitzit</i> have been removed.<br>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Responsa, <i>Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. II, 45) mentions this halachah in regard to the sale of synagogues in neighborhoods where Jews no longer live.

Those who lived far away... would gather together in the synagogues of their locale.<br>In no source other than <i>Megillah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) is it mentioned that the <i>anshei ma'amad</i> would pray in the street.<br>", "because too many people gather to fit within a synagogue, - Note <i>Ta'anit</i> 16a which states that the people would pray in the street as an expression of shame and embarrassment; alternatively, because leaving one's normal place of prayer is a form of exile which brings atonement. Interestingly, the Rambam ignores both these reasons and offers a reason which is not mentioned in previous sources.<br>", "[the street] does not possess any quality of sanctity, because [praying there is only a temporary measure] and it is not established as a place of prayer.", "Similarly, buildings and courtyards where people gather to pray - even for communal prayer, e.g., a room in an office building where people gather for prayer.<br>", "do not possess any measure of sanctity, - Thus, it is also permitted to perform mundane activities (those mentioned in Halachah 6) in these buildings.<br>", "because they were not designated for prayer alone. Rather, [people] pray within them as a temporary measure, as a person prays within his home. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 153:8 mentions a situation in which a building is designated as a synagogue temporarily, for merely a limited period. During that time, it has the holiness of a synagogue. However, once it is no longer used as a synagogue, it has no holiness.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1": ["The text -- As mentioned in the introduction, the Rambam composed the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intention of providing our people with clear directives concerning the performance of all the mitzvot. Hence, he also includes in this work the text of all necessary prayers and legal documents.<br>", "the Haggadah -- The main body of the Haggadah was composed early in our nation's history. Some authorities attribute it to the <i>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</i>, who composed it together with the other prayers and blessings they authored. Large portions of the Haggadah are found verbatim in the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i>, Chapter Ten, and reference is made there to other sections that are not explicitly quoted.<br>However, as obvious from the discussion in that chapter, the precise text of the Haggadah was a matter of debate and question throughout the Talmudic period. A few centuries after the completion of the Talmud, Rav Amram Gaon composed a text of the Haggadah that was accepted internationally, throughout all Jewish communities. Approximately sixty years later, his successor, Rav Saadia Gaon, composed a Haggadah with some changes and emendations. These two texts served as the basis for the Rambam's Haggadah and for the subsequent texts published by other Sages. Only minor differences exist between the Haggadah we use today and that composed by Rav Amram Gaon.<br>", "customarily recited...in the time of exile -- as stated in Halachot 8:3-5, there are certain differences between the text we recite and that recited when the Paschal sacrifice may be offered.<br>", "One begins, [pouring out] the second cup -- After reciting <i>kiddush</i>, washing one's hands, and partaking of the <i>karpas</i>, as mentioned in Halachah 8:1-2.<br>It must be noted that the Rambam prescribes that <i>yachatz</i>, the breaking of the <i>afikoman</i>, be performed directly before eating the matzah and not before beginning the recitation of the Haggadah, as is our custom.<br>", "In haste, we left Egypt -- This statement, half in Hebrew and half in Aramaic, refers to Deuteronomy 16:3. This line is not included in the Haggadot of Rav Amram or Rav Saadia Gaon, nor is it found in most subsequent Haggadot.<br>", "This is the bread of affliction -- This passage is not explicitly mentioned in the Talmud. However, <i>Ta'anit</i> 20b records that before the Seder, Rav Huna would open his door and announce: \"Whoever is needy, let him come and eat.\"<br>In contrast to the rest of the Haggadah, this passage is recited in Aramaic. Among the explanations for this practice are:<br>a) This enabled the passage to be understood by all participants, since Aramaic was the common language of the time (<i>Tosefot Rid, Manhig</i>). Accordingly, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 473:6) relates that he would translate the passage into Yiddish at his Seder.<br>b) The angels do not understand Aramaic, and hence they will not accuse us of being unworthy of redemption (Ritbah).<br>c) The demons do not understand Aramaic, and thus they will not accept our invitation to the Seder (Rashi, <i>HaPardes</i>). This reason is questioned, because Pesach is a \u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05e9\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd (a protected night), on which the demons have no power to harm a Jew.<br>", "This year -- Our Haggadot (and that of Rav Amram Gaon) state \u05d4\u05e9\u05ea\u05d0, \"now.\" However, Rav Saadia Gaon's Haggadah also uses the Hebrew \u05d4\u05d0 \u05e9\u05ea\u05d0, \"this year.\" However, unlike the Rambam, he employs that expression for both clauses.<br>", "Why is this night different from all other nights? -- The practice of asking the four questions is explicitly mentioned in the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a.<br>", "On all other nights, we are not required to dip even once -- Note the commentary on Halachah 8:2 regarding the order of the questions.<br>", "On all other nights, we eat either sitting upright or reclining -- As explained in the commentary on Halachah 2, this question is not mentioned in the Talmud. Hence, some commentaries maintain that it was added in later generations. Nevertheless, the fact that the Rambam includes it together with the question concerning roasted meat appears to indicate that he maintains that this question had been asked during the time the Temple was standing.<br>", "We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt -- <i>Pesachim</i> 115a mentions the beginning of this passage within the context of the discussion of the requirement to begin the description of the Exodus by telling of our people's roots. See also the commentary on Halachah 7:4.<br>", "elders -- This expression is not included in the text of the Haggadah quoted by many authorities, including the <i>Shibolei HaLeket</i> and the Avudraham. Some manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> also omit it. Similarly, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, Mitzvah 157, the Rambam makes statements similar to those of this passage without mentioning this expression.<br>", "Once Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Tarfon -- There is no explicit mention of this passage in the Talmud, although a somewhat parallel story is related in the <i>Tosefta, Pesachim</i>, Chapter 10.<br>", "Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah -- <i>Berachot</i> 12b quotes these statements without any reference to the gathering in Bnei Brak.<br>", "said to them -- This phrase is not mentioned in our text of the Haggadah. Its inclusion answers a question frequently raised: Why does the Haggadah mention this concept, which deals with the mitzvah to recall the Exodus from Egypt each day, on the Seder night? The recollection of the Exodus at the Seder is of a different nature entirely.<br>However, this addition clarifies the issue: This was one of the subjects discussed by the Sages in Bnei Brak.<br>", "Blessed be the Omnipresent -- The use of the word \u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd as a name for God is based on <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 68:9: \"He is the place of the world and the world is not His place.\"<br><b>who has given the Torah to Israel; blessed be He --</b> Our text of the Haggadah employs a slightly different version, mentioning four expressions of blessing to parallel the four sons.<br><b>The Torah speaks of four sons --</b> This passage is found with certain emendations in the Jerusalem Talmud and in the Mechiltah.<br><b>that God, our Lord, has commanded you --</b> Both the aforementioned sources state \"has commanded us,\" preventing comparison between the wise and wicked sons. Nevertheless, the Rambam (as well as Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon) found it more appropriate to quote the verse from the Torah verbatim.<br><b>reply to him, [teaching him] the laws of Pesach... --</b> Our text of the Jerusalem Talmud includes this as the answer to the simple son. Other commentaries (See <i>P'nei David, Simchat HaRegel</i>) give this as the answer to the wicked son.<br><b>dessert --</b> The literal meaning of the Greek word <i>afikoman</i>--see the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <b>Pesachim</b> 10:8.<br><b>you should blunt his teeth and tell him...-</b> Exodus 12:27 states that the question asked by the wicked son should be answered differently: \"It is the Passover service to God...\" The <i>Zevach Pesach</i> explains that the Haggadah implies, in addition to the reply given in the Torah, that he be reprimanded strongly, \"blunt his teeth...\"<br><b>The simple son --</b> the Jerusalem Talmud uses the expression: \"the foolish son.\"<br><b>\"You shall tell your son on that day.\" --</b> This verse, both the answer to the son who does not know how to ask and the source for the mitzvah to relate the story of the Exodus, serves as a transition between the passage of the four sons and the narrative of our redemption. (See also Halachah 7:1.)<br><b>\"it is because of this.\" --</b> The word \u05d6\u05d4 (this) is always used to refer to a clearly visible entity, as <i>Menachot</i> 29a comments on Exodus 12:2. Similarly, in this context, \"this\" refers to a situation where symbols of the Exodus, the matzah and the maror, are visibly present before us.<br><b>In the beginning, our ancestors were worshipers of other gods --</b> <i>Pesachim</i> 115a quotes this passage as reflecting the principle that the narrative of the Exodus must begin by relating our people's roots. (See Halachah 7:4.) It must be noted that the Rambam chooses slightly different phraseology from that employed in other Haggadot.<br><b>Blessed be He Who keeps His promise to Israel --</b> This passage is found in the Haggadot of Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon. However, its origins are unknown.<br><b>the Holy One, blessed be He, calculated the end of [our bondage] --</b> i.e. counting the 400 years of oppression from the birth of Isaac, for during that entire time, the Jews were \"strangers in a land that is not their own.\" The Egyptian exile itself lasted only 210 years.

[The passage is found in the <i>Mechiltah d'Rashbi</i> in its entirety. However, some authorities maintain that it was a later addition.] Nevertheless, other early collections of Midrashim, such as <i>Lekach Tov, Midrash HaGadol,</i> and the <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, include the complete text.<br><b>\"I made you as numerous as the plants of the field...\" --</b> Though the verse has no explicit connection to the Exodus, the commentaries explain that it describes the situation of the Jews in Egypt in metaphoric terms.<br>Many texts of the Haggadah also include the previous verse from Ezekiel: \"And when I passed by you, I saw you weltering in your blood...\" Rav Ya'akov Emden relates that he and his father, the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i>, would recite this verse even though he did not find it in other texts. (His statement is slightly questionable. There are some earlier texts of the Haggadah, such as <i>Siddur HaAri zal</i>, which do include it.)<br><b>\"I will pass through... and I will slay... I will execute... I, God.\" --</b> Our text of the Haggadah contains a further elaboration of this verse, showing how each use of the word \"I\" is intended to exclude God's use of an intermediary to execute judgement.<br><b>Rabbi Yehudah coined abbreviations for them: detzach, adash, b'achav. --</b> This concludes the exegesis of the verses of the \u05d5\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd in the <i>Sifri</i>.<br>Our Haggadot (and similarly, those of Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon) continue with a number of other passages:<br>a) Statements by Rabbi Yossi HaG'lili, Rabbi Eliezer, and Rabbi Akiva concerning the number of plagues with which the Egyptians were punished;<br>b) Passages recounting the extent of God's generosity to the Jewish people.<br>The first group of statements have their source in the <i>Mechiltah</i>. Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, relates that his father did not include them in his text of the Haggadah because they were not popularly known. Nevertheless, it was his custom to recite them at the Seder.<br>The source for the second grouping of passages is less clear.

However, in contrast to the Talmud and our text of the Haggadah, the Rambam's text omits quoting Exodus 13:8: \"And you shall tell your son...\" Apparently, the Rambam had a different text of the Mishnah, which omitted this verse. This difference in texts is also the source for the Rambam's statements, Halachah 7:6: \"In every generation, a person is obligated to present himself...\" See the commentary on that halachah.<br><b>He brought us out from there --</b> Ravvah, <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid., requires reciting this verse.<br><b>Therefore, we are obliged to thank, praise, laud, glorify, exalt, magnify, adore, and give eternal praise --</b> With slight textual differences, this entire passage is found in <i>Pesachim</i> 116b.

To commemorate the latter recitation, we recite the Hallel at the Seder.<br>We divide the Hallel into two portions (see <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid. and Halachah 8:5):<br>the first, containing Psalms referring to the Exodus from Egypt, we recite before the meal;<br>the second, containing Psalms referring to the Messianic redemption (see <i>Pesachim</i> 118a), is recited after the meal.<br><b>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who redeemed us and redeemed our ancestors... --</b> This blessing is quoted from <i>Pesachim</i> 116b. The first portion was also recited while the Temple was standing.<br><b>So too, God, our Lord and Lord of our fathers, enable us to reach --</b>This portion of the blessing, composed by Rabbi Akiva, represents a prayer for our redemption and the rebuilding of the Temple. (See <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid., Halachah 8:5.)<br><b>other festivals --</b> The word \"other\" can also imply \"of a different nature\"--i.e., we pray for the Messianic redemption, when our festivals will be of an entirely different nature.<br><b>we shall eat of the sacrifices --</b> the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering<br><b>and of the Paschal offerings --</b> The <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was not sacrificed when Pesach began on Saturday night. Accordingly, it is our custom to reverse the order of these sacrifices on such an occasion. However, the Rambam does not mention such a practice.<br><b>Then, we shall sing a new song for our redemption --</b> The <i>Mechiltah</i> (see also <i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i>, ibid.) notes that the Bible mentions nine songs sang by the Jewish people as a collective entity. In each case, the Hebrew for song, \u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4, is used in the feminine gender, for our redemption was not complete. In contrast, the song to be sung to greet Mashiach will be a<br>\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9, a new song. The masculine gender is used because the Messianic redemption will represent the complete and ultimate liberation of our people. May it come speedily in our days.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.2": ["On Pesach -- As stated in Halachah 9, once chametz becomes forbidden on noon of the fourteenth of Nisan, we may not derive any benefit from it.<br>", "it is forbidden to derive any benefit from chametz -- for example, to sell it or use it for purposes other than eating.<br>", "as [Exodus 13:3] states: \"Do not eat (<br>\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc", ") chametz\"; i.e., it is not permitted [to be used to derive benefit that leads to] \u2014 The bracketed additions are based on Rashi's commentary on <i>Pesachim</i> 21b.<br>", "eating. -- The Rambam's statements are somewhat problematic. <i>Pesachim</i> 21b records the following disagreement between the Sages:Chizkiyah states: What is the source from which we learn that it is forbidden to derive benefit from chametz? [Exodus 13:3] states: \"Do not eat (\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc) chametz\"; i.e., it is not permitted [to be used to derive benefit that leads to] eating.<br>His decision is based on the fact that the Torah uses the expression \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc. Had the Torah not written \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc \u05dc\u05d0, we may presume that a prohibition against eating would be implied, but not a prohibition against deriving benefit.<br>This contradicts the opinion of R. Abahu who states: Wherever the Torah states \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d0\u05db\u05dc, \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dcor \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5, a prohibition against eating and deriving benefit is implied.The Rambam's statements in this Halachah quote the opinion of Chizkiyah. However, in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 8:15, he quotes the opinion of R. Abahu as accepted halachah.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> resolves the contradiction, explaining that in the halachah at hand, there is no difference in law between Chizkiyah and R. Abahu. Therefore, although the Rambam generally accepts R. Abahu's opinion, in this instance he quotes Chizkiyah's statements because the manner in which the latter derives the concept is more explicit.<br>", "A person who leaves chametz within his property on Pesach, even though he does not eat it, transgresses two prohibitions: [Exodus 13:7] states: \"No leavening agent may be seen in all your territory\" -- This prohibition is counted as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah: <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, negative commandment 200; <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, mitzvah 20.<br>", "and [Exodus 12:19] states: \"No leavening agent may be found in your homes\" -- This prohibition is counted as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah: <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, negative commandment 201; <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, mitzvah 11.<br>", "[Though the prohibitions stated in these verses apply to<br>\u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8,] \u2014 <i>S'or</i> refers to leavening agents, notably yeast.<br>", "it is the same prohibition which forbids both<br>\u05d7\u05de\u05e5 (leaven) and \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 (a leavening agent) \u2014 <i>Beitzah</i> 7a explains that Exodus 13:7 mentions both chametz (leaven), and \u05e9\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8 (<i>S'or</i>, a leavening agent) in the same verse to emphasize that they are identical.<br>The Ra'avad comments that the equation between the prohibitions against chametz and <i>S'or</i> is not complete. Among the differences between them are: Once chametz is no longer fit to be eaten by a dog, it is no longer prohibited. In contrast, yeast is never fit to be eaten and is prohibited even in that state. Nevertheless, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> do not accept his statements.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.3": ["[A violator] is not lashed -- this is the punishment given for the active violation of any of the Torah's prohibitions that are not punishable by death.<br>", "for [transgressing the prohibitions] not to have [chametz] seen [in his possession] and not to have [chametz] found [in his possession] unless he purchased chametz on Pesach -- The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> emphasizes that this law applies only to chametz purchased from a gentile. However, once chametz belonging to a Jew becomes prohibited, that Jew no longer has the authority to sell it. Thus, the purchaser will never really become the legal owner of the chametz (See Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 35a; <i>Tosefot, Chullin</i> 4b).<br>The <i>Or Sameach</i> questions how a person can become liable even for chametz purchased from a gentile, but resolves the issue based on the commentary of Rabbenu Nissim (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>, Chapter 3).<br>", "or [caused flour] to become leavened, and thus committed a deed. -- The <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> raises a significant question: A person is not liable for lashes for violating any prohibition which he can correct by fulfilling a positive commandment (\u05dc\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea\u05e7): For example, if a person violates the prohibition against taking both a mother bird and her eggs, he can free himself from the punishment of lashes by sending away the mother bird.<br><i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 29b) states that the prohibition against chametz being seen in one's property falls into the above category, because one can correct the violation of this prohibition by fulfilling the positive commandment to destroy chametz. Thus, it appears that a person can never be held liable for lashes for this transgression.<br>Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that of Rav Chayim Soloveitchik, who explains that <i>Tosefot's</i> statements apply only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who maintains that chametz must be destroyed by burning. However, according to the Sages (whose opinion is accepted by the Rambam, Halachah 3:11), who maintain that chametz can be destroyed by any means, not necessarily burning, the prohibition against possessing chametz is not considered a \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea\u05e7 \u05dc\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4.<br>What is the essential difference between these opinions: Rabbi Yehudah maintains that the fundamental aspect of the mitzvah to destroy chametz revolves upon the article itself (\u05d7\u05e4\u05e6\u05d4); it is a mitzvah to destroy chametz. In contrast, the Sages maintain that the mitzvah centers on the person (\u05d2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4); he is commanded to remove all chametz from his possession.<br>According to Rabbi Yehudah, since the commandment revolves around the chametz itself, its destruction directly \"corrects\" the sin of its possession. In contrast, according to the Sages, the positive commandment of ridding one's house of chametz is merely a reinforcement of the prohibition against its possession, and the fulfillment of the positive commandment does not have the power to \"correct\" the violation of the prohibition.<br>", "However, if he possessed chametz before Pesach, and when Pesach came he did not destroy it, and left it in his possession -- However, should he remove it from his possession (by giving it to another person or declaring it ownerless), he is not liable even if he does not actually destroy the object.<br>", "even though he transgresses two prohibitions, according to the Torah, he is not lashed, for he did not perform a deed. -- <i>Sh'vuot</i> 21b states: \"The transgression of any prohibition which does not involve a deed is not punishable by lashing.\"<br>", "[Nevertheless,] he is given stripes for being rebellious -- \"Stripes for being rebellious (\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05e8\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea)\" is a punishment instituted by the Sages for violation of a Rabbinic prohibition. A person liable for lashing according to Torah law receives a uniform number of 39 lashes unless he is physically incapable of bearing that number. In contrast, the number of lashes given to a person liable for \"stripes for being rebellious\" is left to the discretion of the court.<br><i>Chullin</i> 14b states that this punishment is also inflicted upon those who violate a Torah prohibition that is not punishable by lashing.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.4": ["It is prohibited to ever benefit from chametz -- itself, in contrast to mixtures of chametz, as explained in Halachah 5.<br>", "[that a Jew] -- in contrast to a gentile (<i>Pesachim</i> 28a).<br>", "possessed during Pesach -- This prohibition applies to all Jews, not only to the owner of the chametz (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Pesachim</i> 28). Thus, it is prohibited to buy chametz from a store owned by a Jew who did not observe the prohibition against possessing chametz on Pesach.<br>", "This prohibition is a penalty instituted by the Sages. -- <i>Pesachim</i> 29a mentions Rabbi Yehudah's opinion that the prohibition stems from the Torah itself. However, this opinion is not accepted as halachah.<br>The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> explains that the debate between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon (who maintains that the Torah does not forbid benefiting from chametz after Pesach) revolves around an abstract concept. Rabbi Yehudah maintains that once Pesach comes, chametz itself becomes forbidden and, therefore, can never become permitted again. In contrast, Rabbi Shimon maintains that the prohibition does not affect the essence of the chametz itself. Thus, we are forbidden to benefit from it during Pesach, but after Pesach there is no prohibition.<br>", "Since the person transgressed the [prohibitions against chametz] being found and being seen [in his possession], they prohibited its use -- The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the prohibition against using a Jew's chametz after Pesach applies even when the prohibitions against possessing chametz are not violated. See Halachah 4:5.<br>", "[The above applies] even if he inadvertently left [the chametz in his possession during Pesach] -- e.g., he forgot that he possessed it.<br>", "or was forced to do so -- The <i>Nodah BiYhudah</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 20) gives an example of such a case. A thief stole chametz from a person before Pesach and returned it to him after the holiday. Even though the person had no opportunity to destroy it before Pesach, it is forbidden.<br>In that responsum, the <i>Nodah BiYhudah</i> also raises the following question: A person died on the fourteenth of Nisan without nullifying or selling his chametz. Are his heirs forbidden to benefit from that chametz or not? He maintains that although the Rambam would probably prohibit benefiting from this chametz, there are rationales on the basis of which its use may be permitted. [Other authorities (note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Kuntres Acharon</i> 435) do not accept this conclusion.]<br>", "[These stringencies were instituted] lest a person -- intentionally<br>", "leave chametz in his possession during Pesach in order to benefit from it after Pesach -- on the pretense that he had forgotten about its existence.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.5": ["If, on Pesach, -- Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> maintain that this principle does not apply until the holiday itself actually begins.

Though others, among them the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, do not accept this view, it is accepted as Halachah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 447:2).<br>", "even the slightest amount of chametz becomes mixed together with another substance -- Ordinarily, it is permissible to use a mixture of a prohibited substance and a permitted substance provided that the permitted substance is present in a greater amount, to the extent that the prohibition is nullified (\u05d1\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5\u05dc \u05d0\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05e8).<br>", "either of its kind -- When the prohibited substance is of the same kind as the forbidden substance (e.g., improperly slaughtered meat mixed with properly slaughtered meat), all that is required to nullify the prohibition is that the permitted substance constitutes the majority of the mixture (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:1).<br>", "or not of its kind -- When the prohibited substance is of a different kind from the permitted (e.g., forbidden fats mixed with grain), the prohibition is ordinarily nullified if the taste of the forbidden article is not discernible, or the quantity of the permitted substance is at least 60 times as great as the forbidden article (ibid. 15:1, 6).<br>", "[the entire mixture] is forbidden -- The above principles do not apply with regard to chametz on Pesach. Even the slightest mixture of chametz may not be eaten, nor may benefit be derived from it. In <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> (15:9), the Rambam explains that this stringency is instituted because chametz is a \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05df (a substance which later will become permitted).<br>A \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05df which becomes mixed together with a permitted substance of its own kind is never permitted to be used because of the following rationale: Since its use in its entirety will later become permitted, there is no need to grant a leniency allowing it to be eaten when forbidden.<br>Similarly, with regard to chametz on Pesach: There is no prohibition against using a mixture of chametz after Pesach. Hence, there is no need to grant permission to eat such a mixture on Pesach itself, even though the quantity of the permitted substance far surpasses that of the chametz.<br>Furthermore, there is a stricter dimension to chametz than to any other \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05df. Generally, a \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e9\u05d9\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05df is permitted if it becomes mixed with a substance of another kind to the extent that its taste can no longer be discerned. However, this leniency is not granted regarding mixtures of chametz. Since Exodus 12:20 states: \"You must not eat any leaven,\" the severity of the prohibition obligates additional stringency.<br>", "Though it is forbidden to benefit from chametz which a Jew possessed on Pesach, if it became mixed with another substance, whether of its kind -- for example, a dough containing yeast mixed with flour.<br>", "or not of its kind -- for example, a mixture of flour with any other substance.<br>", "it is permitted to be eaten after Pesach. -- The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> explains that this leniency applies whether the mixture occurred after Pesach or on the holiday itself. Nevertheless, the latter point should not be misinterpreted. Should such a mixture be discovered on Pesach, we are obligated to destroy it (<i>Ramah, Orach Chayim</i> 447:1). Nevertheless, if either intentionally or unintentionally, the mixture was not destroyed on the holiday itself, it may be used afterwards.<br>", "[The Sages] only penalized and forbade [the use of] chametz itself. A mixture [containing chametz possessed on Pesach] is permitted to be eaten after Pesach. -- <i>Pesachim</i> 30a explains that since the penalty is of Rabbinic origin, it was applied only to chametz itself and not to mixtures.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.6": ["One is only liable for \u05db\u05e8\u05ea \u2014 as stated in Halachah 1<br>", "for eating chametz itself.

Generally, the beer referred to in the Talmud was made from fermented dates (Rashi, <i>Pesachim</i> 42b).<br>", "or similar mixtures which contain chametz -- <i>Pesachim</i> 42a also emphasizes that a person transgresses the commandments against possessing chametz if he owns any of the above mixtures.<br>", "[is punished by] lashes and is not liable for<br>\u05db\u05e8\u05ea", "[for this involves the transgression of a different commandment] \u2014 different from eating chametz itself<br>", "as [Exodus 12:20] states: \"Do not eat any leaven.\" -- The <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (negative commandment 198) and the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 12) consider this as one of the Torah's 613 commandments.<br>Nevertheless, this decision is a matter of debate among the commentators. The Ramban (<i>Hasagot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>) does not accept the Rambam's view, and explains that a person who consumes an olive size of chametz within the specific time period (\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1 \u05db\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d0\u05db\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea) described below should be liable for \u05db\u05e8\u05ea as described in Halachah 1. See also Halachah 4:8 and commentary.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> supports the Ramban's view, noting that in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:3, the Rambam himself explains that any person who eats a mixture containing an olive size of a forbidden food within this time period is liable, just as if he had eaten the forbidden food itself.<br>Based on the explanation of the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 442), the <i>Drisha</i> and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> interpret the Rambam as referring to a mixture to which the chametz does not impart any flavor and is added only for consistency and color.<br>The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> offers a different interpretation, explaining that were chametz to be mixed with other foods, a person eating the mixture would be liable for \u05db\u05e8\u05ea as the Ramban states. However, the Rambam is talking about an instance when flour was mixed with another substance and became leavened as part of the mixture, without ever becoming a distinct entity of its own. The Torah considers this as a different category of chametz and holds a person who eats it liable for a lesser punishment.<br>", "When does the above apply? When the person consumed an olive size -- the minimum size of a prohibited substance for which one is liable for punishment, as explained in Halachah 1.<br>", "of chametz [while eating] from the mixture within the time it takes to eat three eggs or less -- This period (\u05db\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d0\u05db\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05e4\u05e8\u05e1 in Hebrew) is significant in halachah. Just as the Torah requires a specific quantity, the size of an olive, as regards many of the mitzvot and prohibitions concerning eating, it also specifies a limited period in which this amount of food must be consumed: \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05e4\u05e8\u05e1 \u05db\u05d3\u05d9.<br>This measure is also a point of Rabbinic controversy. The Rambam defines it as the time it takes to eat three eggs (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 14:8). Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 44a) takes a more lenient view, defining it as the amount of time it takes to eat four eggs. As regards this matter as well, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 612:4) advises that whenever a question of Torah law is involved, the more stringent opinion should be observed. However, in questions of Rabbinic law, the more lenient view can be relied on.<br>In converting this figure to modern measures of time, there is also a difference of opinion. The shortest opinion limits this period to two minutes. The most commonly accepted view is four minutes and there are opinions of seven and eight minutes as well.<br>", "Then, he is obligated for lashes by the Torah -- as explained above.<br>", "However, if he does not consume an olive size of chametz from the mixture in less time than it takes to eat three eggs, even though eating it is forbidden -- for as explained in the previous halachah, chametz can never be nullified within a mixture. As the following halachah explains, eating less than an olive size of chametz is also prohibited by Torah law. Nevertheless,<br>", "he is not [punished by] lashing.

The Babylonian Talmud (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29a) derives the mitzvah from the verse (Genesis 21:4 , \"And Avraham circumcised his son, Isaac.\" This indicates that the mitzvah is primarily the father's (although after the son reaches adulthood, he also becomes responsible). In contrast, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7) quotes as a proof-text for the mitzvah (Leviticus 12:3 , \"On the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.\" The <i>Korban Eidah</i> explains that this implies the mitzvah is the son's. Since he is not able to perform it himself as a youth, however, his father is given the responsibility while the child is a minor.<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i> continues, explaining that the Rambam's position is obvious from his discussion of the blessings recited for the mitzvot in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i>, Chapter 11. In Halachah 11 of that chapter, the Rambam explains that if one performs a mitzvah on one's own behalf, one should use the form, \"who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us", "to....\" In contrast, if one performs a mitzvah on behalf of another person, one uses the form, \"... and commanded us", "concerning....\"<br>Rav Yitzchak ben Sheshet (Responsum 131) notes that the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 11:5) rules that one should recite the blessing \"...concerning the redemption of a son,\" implying that the mitzvah is not the father's, but the son's (merely that as an infant, the son cannot fulfill it). In contrast, in Chapter 3, Halachah 1, the Rambam states that a father should recite the blessing \"... to circumcise...,\" implying that the mitzvah is his.<br>", "and a master, his slaves. - Here, the responsibility for the mitzvah is surely the master's. This circumcision is one of the stages in the process by which the slave attains the status of <i>eved C'na'ani</i>, an intermediate rung between a gentile and a Jew. He is obligated to fulfill all the negative commandments and all those positive commandments that are not associated with a specific time. (See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 12:11.)<br>", "This applies both to those who are born in his home - i.e., a non-Jewish maidservant gave birth to a male child<br>", "and to those purchased by him. - See Genesis 17:27, which relates that Abraham circumcised both these categories of servants.<br>", "If the father or the master transgressed and did not circumcise them, he negated the fulfillment of a positive commandment. - Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 19:6):<br>If a person transgressed and did not circumcise his son or his servants born in his home... on the eighth day, he transgresses a very great and severe mitzvah, to which there is no comparison among the other mitzvot. He can never compensate for [the lack of fulfillment of] this mitzvah.His sin is much more severe than a person who did not build a sukkah on Sukkot, or one who did not eat matzah on Pesach.<br>", "He is not, however, punished by karet, for karet is incurred only by the uncircumcised person himself. - This is obvious from the proof-text quoted above.<br>", "The court is obligated to circumcise that son or slave at the proper time and should not leave an uncircumcised male among the Jewish people or their slaves. - <i>Kiddushin</i>, loc. cit., interprets Genesis 17:10, \"You must circumcise every male,\" as a charge to the Jewish court, making them responsible for circumcising every member of the people.<br>"], "Circumcision 1.2": ["We may not circumcise a person's son without his knowledge - See <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 7:13-14, where the Rambam describes the prohibition against \"stealing\" the performance of a mitzvah from a colleague, and the fine of ten gold pieces for doing so. The Ramah (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 382:1) explicitly associates this concept with circumcising a person's son without his knowledge.<br>", "unless he has transgressed and did not circumcise him. - The Rambam's phraseology has raised questions among the halachic authorities. Is his intent that once the father has allowed the eighth day to pass, the obligation falls on the court, or is his intent that only after the father makes it obvious that he does not want to circumcise his son that they become responsible? Similarly, the question has been raised what should be done if the father is unaware that a son has been born to him, or is prevented from carrying out the circumcision by factors beyond his control. Should the circumcision be carried out on the eighth day, or should the family wait until the father returns? See <i>Avnei Nezer</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 318) and Rav Kapach's commentary.<br>", "[In such an instance,] the court must circumcise - the obligation mentioned in the previous halachah falls upon them<br>", "[the child] against [the father's] will. - Even if he protests, the mitzvah should be performed.<br>", "If the matter does not become known to the court and they do not circumcise him, when [the child] reaches <i>bar mitzvah</i> he is obligated to circumcise himself. - <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there are three aspects to the mitzvah of circumcision:<br>a) to remove the foreskin;b) to be circumcised;c) not to be uncircumcised. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.)&lt; /p&gt;<br>The first aspect involves a single deed. The second and third dimensions, however, are ongoing qualities that a person continues to possess even after the deed of circumcision is completed. Thus, the <i>Or Zarua</i> quotes <i>Menachot</i> 43b, which relates that when King David entered the bathhouse, he was upset for he was \"naked,\" without mitzvot. When he remembered that he was circumcised, he relaxed, realizing that he was still involved with the performance of a mitzvah.<br>This indicates that, even years after his circumcision, he was considered to be fulfilling the mitzvah. In contrast, with regard to the mitzvot of tefillin and tzitzit, although he had just removed them, he was no longer considered to be involved in the performance of these mitzvot.<br>", "With each and every day that passes after he has reached <i>bar mitzvah</i>, he negates a positive commandment. - Some of the manuscript editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state, \"It is as if he negates a commandment.\" The mitzvah of circumcision is not negated until the person dies without fulfilling it. Unlike tefillin or tzitzit, where each day a person performs a different mitzvah, there is only one mitzvah of circumcision (Rav Kapach).<br>", "He is not, however, liable for karet until he dies uncircumcised - As mentioned above, there are two dimensions to the punishment of <i>karet</i>: premature death and the cutting off of the soul. According to the Rambam, a person who does not circumcise himself is liable only for the second aspect of this punishment, since until he dies, it is not known whether he will perform the mitzvah or not (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statements, stating that each day he does not perform the mitzvah, he is liable for <i>karet</i> and is worthy of premature death.

Although the fetus itself was purchased separately, since [the master] purchased his mother before the child was born - the child is considered \"home-born\" and<br>", "he should be circumcised on his eighth day. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> relates that, according to the Rambam, even if the master at first purchased only the rights to the fetus, and then purchased the mother, since she gave birth while in his domain, the slave is considered \"home-born,\" and is circumcised on the eighth day.<br>"], "Circumcision 1.5": ["If a person purchased a maidservant for her offspring - In his responsum cited above, the Rambam compares this to a person who buys a tree for its fruit - i.e., he is not the actual owner of the tree, but is entitled to all the fruit it produces. Similarly, in this instance, the master is not the owner of the maidservant; what he has purchased is the right to her offspring. Therefore, none of the offspring are considered \"home-born,\" and must be circumcised immediately.<br>", "or purchased a maidservant with the intent of not immersing her as a slave - Through immersion in a <i>mikveh</i>, a female maidservant becomes a <i>shifchah C'na'anit</i> and attains the intermediate status mentioned in the Commentary on Halachah 1.<br>As the Rambam mentions in the following halachah, it is possible to purchase a gentile slave and maintain possession of him or her without changing his or her status in the above manner.<br>", "even though her offspring is born in his domain, the child should be circumcised on the day he was born. - The first instance mentioned does not require explanation. With regard to the second category, the Rambam elaborates:<br>", "[This ruling was granted, because] this child is considered as if he alone has been purchased [by his master], and it is as if he purchased him this day. His mother is not included among the maidservants of the Jewish people, so that the child could be considered homeborn.\" - In the responsum cited above, the Rambam explains that the concept of a \"home-born\" slave is derived from God's commandment to Abraham. All the members of Abraham's household had accepted his beliefs and way of life. In contrast, a slave who is unwilling to accept the mitzvot cannot be considered part of a Jewish household, and her children are not \"home-born.\"<br>", "If his mother immersed herself after she gave birth - This shows that the stipulation that she need not be immersed (see the following halachah) is nullified and considered of no consequence. Therefore, she is considered to be part of the household, and<br>", "the child should be circumcised on the eighth day. - The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision and maintains that unless the mother immerses herself before giving birth, the child should be circumcised immediately. Rabbenu Nissim, in his notes to <i>Shabbat</i> 135b, supports the Rambam's decision, explaining that the Sages did not reach a final ruling on the matter, and hence the more stringent approach should be taken.<br>"], "Circumcision 1.6": ["When a person purchases a slave from the gentiles and the slave does not consent - Note the difference of opinion in <i>Yevamot</i> 48b, whether this leniency is granted if the slave refuses outright to be circumcised.<br>", "to be circumcised, we may be patient with him for twelve months - lest he change his mind and accept his status within the Jewish people.<br>", "It is forbidden to maintain him for any longer period while he remains uncircumcised, and one must sell him to gentiles. - He must, however, agree to accept the seven universal laws mentioned below. Otherwise, he should be slain (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "If, at the outset, while the slave was still in the possession of his gentile master, he made a stipulation that he would not be circumcised - Rav Kapach maintains that the stipulation was made by the slave's master. Since the slave is considered to be chattel, his own say is of no concern.<br>", "it is permissible to maintain him although he is not circumcised, provided he accepts the seven universal laws commanded to the descendants of Noah - The prohibitions against idol worship, cursing God, murder, theft, adultery, eating flesh taken from a living animal, and the obligation to establish a court system. (See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1-2.)<br>", "and becomes a resident alien. - In <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 10:6, the Rambam writes that it is forbidden to allow gentiles who do not accept these seven laws to dwell in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Therefore, a gentile who does is called a resident alien - i.e., a non-Jew who may dwell among us.<br>", "If he refuses to accept these seven laws - The slave must formally accept the performance of these mitzvot in the presence of a Rabbinic court.<br>", "he should be killed immediately. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's decision depends on his statement (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 8:9) that we must do everything in our power to influence the gentiles to observe these seven laws.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statement, explaining that in the present era, we may not kill any gentiles for refusing to observe these seven laws. The commentaries differ whether the Rambam would accept the Ra'avad's decision (and his statement here is, like many of the other laws he states, reflective of the Messianic era), or whether permission is granted to kill a slave for refusing to follow these laws in the present age as well.<br>", "A resident alien may be accepted only in the era when the laws of yovel - The Jubilee year<br>", "are in effect. - The Jubilee must be observed only when the entire Jewish people are dwelling in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Therefore, when the tribes of Reuven and Gad and half the tribe of Menasheh were exiled by the kingdom of Assyria (see II Kings, Chapter 16), the observance of the Jubilee was nullified (<i>Hilchot Shemitah V'Yovel</i> 10:8).<br>"], "Circumcision 1.7": ["When a convert enters the congregation of Israel, he is obligated to undergo circumcision first. - <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 13:1-4 states:<br>With three acts, Israel entered into a covenant [with God]: circumcision, immersion [in the mikveh], and [the offering of] sacrifices.... Similarly, with regard to future generations, when a gentile wants to enter into the covenant, take refuge under the wings of the Divine Presence, and accept the yoke of the Torah, he must undergo circumcision, immersion, and the offering of a sacrifice.<br>The phrase \"accept the yoke of the Torah\" indicates that before performing these deeds, the prospective convert must resolve to fulfill the mitzvot.<br>", "If he had been circumcised while he was a gentile - and not by a Jew for the purpose of conversion.

The blood is extracted lest the child have a thin foreskin that is not readily noticeable (<i>Shabbat</i> 135a). Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 263:4), which requires the extraction of blood and states that we must inspect such a child carefully - but gently - to see whether he possesses a thin foreskin or not. (Perhaps the expression \"thin foreskin\" refers to the membrane removed by <i>pri'ah</i>.)<br>It must be noted that there are <i>Rishonim</i> (see Rashi,<i>Shabbat</i> 134a) who maintain that the extraction of the \"blood of the covenant\" is not a by-product of a search for a thin membrane, but rather serves an independent purpose: The Jews' covenant with God is established through their blood.<br>", "on the eighth day. - Note Chapter 3, Halachah 6, which states that a blessing is not recited for this activity.<br>The Ramah mentions several other instances when blood must be extracted: a child who was circumcised before the eighth day (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 262:1), circumcised at night ( loc. cit.), or circumcised by a gentile ( loc. cit., 264:1) should have blood extracted for the sake of fulfilling the mitzvah.

Therefore, the Rambam clarified the matter. (See also Halachah 11.)<br>", "and a child who has two foreskins - This refers to a birth abnormality. Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 135b) mentions two interpretations: a person with a single penis that is covered by two foreskins; alternatively, a person with two penises.<br>", "should both be circumcised on the eighth day. - Nevertheless, as explained in Halachah 11, none of the individuals mentioned in this halachah are circumcised on the eighth day if it falls on the Sabbath.<br>"], "Circumcision 1.8": ["Circumcision is performed only during the day - This applies to all circumcisions - those of children, servants, and converts<br>", "after the rising of the sun - This refers to \u05d4\u05e0\u05e5 \u05d4\u05d7\u05de\u05d4, the rising of the sun on the horizon.<br>", "as [Leviticus 12:3] states, \"On the eighth day...,\" i.e., during the day - only,<br>", "and not at night. - In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Megillah</i> 2:4), the Rambam writes that the day extends from dawn to the appearance of the stars.

Indeed, it is considered to be an adornment of the mitzvah. - The latter statement can be understood to be an explanation of the former. In contrast to the other species, the myrtle is considered an adornment of the mitzvah. Since the extra myrtle branches are viewed as adornments, they are not considered to be an intervening substance separating the person from the mitzvah. (See the commentary on Halachah 11.) Nor is including them considered to be adding to the mitzvah (and thus, a violation of \u05d1\u05dc \u05ea\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05e3). (See also Rabbenu Nissim and the Rashba, Vol. I, Responsum 535.)<br>There are some authorities who allow additional myrtle branches to be included even though they do not meet the requirement of having all three leaves on the same level.

Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, writes that, based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 88b, the Rambam amended his own manuscript copy of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> to state \"it does not nullify it\" (<i>Birkat Avraham</i> 31).<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.8": ["What is the required length of each of these species? - The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 650:8 states that if the species are smaller than the minimum limits established, they may not be used throughout the festival.

In his commentary on the above Mishnah, the Rambam emphasizes that the measure refers to three full handbreadths, each four fingerbreadths in length.

Indeed, in general, this clause appears to be more closely related to the principles mentioned in the following chapter, where the Rambam mentions the characteristics that disqualify the various species, rather than in this chapter, where he relates the fundamental requirements of each one. Based on <i>Sukkah</i> 34a, which relates that myrtles which are not dry (a factor still common in many Diaspora communities today) are very difficult to find, we can interpret this as an almost parenthetical expression teaching that freshness is not among the fundamental requirements for a myrtle.]<br>", "If one has bound [the other species together with] the lulav, the shidrah of the lulav must extend beyond the myrtle and the willow a handbreadth or more. - The Rambam maintains that regardless of the length of the myrtles and the willows, the <i>shidrah</i> of the lulav must extend beyond them an additional handbreadth, so that it can be shaken.

He interprets <i>Sukkah</i> 42a, \"If he lifted it up in an opposite manner, he did not fulfill his obligation,\" as referring to such a circumstance. Nevertheless, the Rambam (and similarly, most halachic authorities, including the Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:3) interpret that statement as referring to lifting them up opposite to their natural pattern of growth.<br>", "This applies] only when he lifts them up as they grow. - See Halachah 6 and the commentary on it.<br>", "However, if he does not lift them up as they grow, he has not fulfilled his obligation. - For this reason, it is customary in many communities to hold the etrog upside down before reciting the blessing, and then to turn it right side up after the blessing has been recited.<br>", "The fulfillment of the mitzvah as the law [requires is as follows]: One should lift up the three species as they are bound together in one's right hand and the etrog in one's left hand. - holding the etrog together with the lulav (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:11).<br>In the <i>Beit Yosef</i>, Rav Yosef Karo quotes the following story from the Recanti.

The substance used to bind the lulav is not considered to be an independent entity, but rather an extension of the lulav. This principle is also mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 7 of this chapter and Halachot 5:17-18. The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:8) states that it is customary to remove rings or other intervening substances that cover even small portions of one's hands before taking the lulav.<br>", "However, if one placed these species in a vase or a pot - <i>Sukkah</i> 42a explains that this is unbecoming to the mitzvah.<br>", "and took them, one has not fulfilled one's obligation. - The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 651:31 states that this applies even if the container in which one placed the species is made of silver or gold.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.12": ["If one binds the lulav together with the myrtle and the willow and separates between the lulav and the myrtle with a cloth or the like - i.e., a substance which does not contribute to the lulav's attractiveness<br>", "it is considered to be a separation. - between the various species. Taking the lulav in this manner is not acceptable. The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:1) notes that the myrtle branches are frequently bound together with a cord.

In that vein, <i>Avot</i> 2:15 counsels: \"Prepare yourself to study Torah, for it is not an inheritance.\" Therefore, the Rambam continues...<br>", "Whoever desires - In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 4:17, the Rambam relates the content of this halachah and uses the expression: \"Whoever desires to be crowned with the crown of Torah.\"<br>", "may - fulfill the directives mentioned in this chapter, and thus...<br>", "come and take it.", "Lest you say that the other crowns surpass the crown of Torah, [Proverbs 8:15-16] states, \"By me, kings reign, princes decree justice - the latter clause is omitted in many manuscript copies of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.<br>", "and nobles rule.\" Thus, you have learned that the crown of Torah is greater than the other two. - The <i>Sifre, ibid.</i>, states: \"Who is greater, the one who conveys the crown or the one who is crowned!\" Thus, we can appreciate that the crown of Torah surpasses the crown of royalty. Since a king is given greater honor than the High Priest, we can also assume that the crown of Torah is greater than the crown of priesthood (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).<br>"], "Torah Study 3.2": ["Our Sages - <i>Horayot</i> 13a", "declared that even a Torah Sage who is a mamzer - a child born from certain forbidden sexual relations.

(See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Yoma</i> 1:3.)<br>", "as [implied by Proverbs 3:15]: \"It is more precious than pearls.\" - Because of the similarity between the Hebrew for \"pearls,\" <i>peninim</i>, and the Hebrew for \"inner,\" <i>p\u2019nim</i>.<br>", "[That verse can be interpreted] - <i>Horayot, ibid.</i>, to mean:", "more precious than the High Priest who enters the innermost chambers. - i.e., the Holy of Holies.<br>In the introduction to this text, the Rambam explained that he structured it to be <i>halachot, halachot</i> (law after law), implying that he would include only statements of Torah law. In contrast, other concepts, though ethically or philosophically significant, were not included.<br>Accordingly, this halachah and the others in this chapter which praise Torah study must be understood as behavioral directives applicable with regard to:a) the arrangements of one's own priorities and goals in life;b) the order in which people must be given honor and respect.<br>"], "Torah Study 3.3": ["None of the other mitzvot can be equated to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah can be equated to all the mitzvot - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1 as the source for this statement. That Mishnah lists a number of mitzvot whose \"benefits are enjoyed in this world, though the principle [reward] remains for the world to come\" and concludes \"the study of Torah is equivalent to them all.\"<br>However, the <i>Lev Shlomo</i> notes that the antecedents of the phrase \"them all\" are the various mitzvot which are mentioned previously in the mishnah and not \"all the mitzvot of the Torah.\" Hence, he refers to the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1), which states: \"All the mitzvot of the Torah are not worth one word of the Torah.\"<br>", "because study leads to deed. - for without study, one will never know how to fulfill the mitzvot properly.<br>", "Therefore, study takes precedence over deed - See Chapter 1, Halachah 3, and the commentary on it.<br>Though there is a similarity between the halachah cited above and the present one, the two are not redundant. That halachah deals with the course of action proper for a person whose father has not instructed him in Torah study. Thus, the Rambam tells him that rather than ignore Torah study and devote himself to the performance of good deeds alone, he should study.<br>This chapter centers around the principle that Torah study is the highest rung a person can reach. Accordingly, the advice in this and the following halachah applies to even a person who has established a basis of Torah knowledge. It teaches him to seek personal fulfillment in study rather than in deed. Similarly, it advises us that the most propitious way to use each moment of spare time is to devote these moments to Torah study.<br>", "in all cases - with the exception of the instance mentioned in the following halachah.<br>"], "Torah Study 3.4": ["[The following rules apply] when a person is confronted with the performance of a mitzvah and the study of Torah - and the performance of the mitzvah would cause him to interrupt his studies.<br>", "If the mitzvah can be performed by another individual, he should not interrupt his studies. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites the following narrative from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pesachim</i> 3:7):<br>Rabbi Abahu sent his son to study in Tiberias. When he came to visit him, the local people praised his son for his piety in burying the dead. When he heard this, Rabbi Abahu rebuked his son severely, \"Is it because there are no graves in Caesarea that I sent you to Tiberias?\"<br><i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 9b derives the priority of study over the performance of mitzvot as follows:<br>Proverbs 3:15 states: \"None of your desires can be equated to it [the Torah],\" implying that \"your desires\" - i.e., things which man wants - cannot be equated to Torah study, but \"God's desires\" - i.e., the mitzvot - can be equated with it.<br>In contrast, Proverbs 8:11 states: \"No desire\" - seemingly implying even God's desires, the mitzvot - \"can be equated to it.\" How can the two be resolved? When it is possible for the mitzvah to be performed by another individual, nothing takes precedence over Torah study. However, if there is no one else to perform the mitzvah, the performance of the mitzvah is given priority.<br>", "If not - If there is no way the mitzvah can be performed by another person - e.g., paying honor to a deceased person or collecting for charity, when one's position will cause one's words to have a greater effect than those of other people...<br>", "he should perform the mitzvah - <i>Berachot</i> 17a teaches: \"The ultimate of knowledge is Teshuvah and good deeds.\" Similarly, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:2) states that it would be preferable for a person who studies without performing the mitzvot never to have been created. Thus, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:2) relates that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who would not interrupt his studies even for prayer, would stop studying to build a sukkah and to bind his lulav.<br>", "The rationale behind the above statements can be explained as follows: As explained in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 3, the ultimate level of fulfillment man can reach is to step beyond his humanity and fulfill God's will, as revealed in the mitzvot. Nevertheless, priority is given to Torah study, because it possesses a twofold advantage over the other mitzvot: first, it leads to their fulfillment; second, it allows for an internalized connection to be established between the person and God.", "However, when the person ignores the fulfillment of the mitzvot, both those advantages are lost. Obviously, the study does not lead to deed, and, furthermore, his intellectual activity appears to be a matter of personal interest and not a process of connection to God.", "and then return to his studies."], "Torah Study 3.5": ["The first aspect of a person's judgement [in the world to come] will center on Torah study. Only afterwards will his other deeds [be considered]. - The statement is based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7a. Other sources (<i>Shabbat</i> 31a) state that the first question posed to a person in the world to come will be: \"Did you deal faithfully in business?\"<br><i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> <i>ibid.</i>, offers two possible resolutions to this apparent contradiction:a) A person who never studied at all is judged first regarding Torah study. However, one who studied, but did not establish fixed times for study is judged first regarding his business affairs;b) Even though the first question that the soul is asked centers on his business affairs, the first retribution he will receive will result from his neglect of Torah study.<br>", "Accordingly, our Sages - See <i>Pesachim</i> 50b, <i>Sotah</i> 22b, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 105b.<br>", "would say: \"A person should always occupy himself in Torah study, whether for God's sake or even if not for God's sake - The Rambam elaborates further on the definition of these concepts in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 10:4-5:<br>The Sages of the previous generations declared: Should one say: \"I will study Torah in order that I become wealthy, in order that I be called a Rabbi, or in order that I receive reward in the world to come?\" The Torah teaches [Deuteronomy 11:13]: \"[If you are careful to observe My commandments...] to love God;\" [implying] that all that you do should be done only out of love.The Sages also said: [Psalms 112:1 instructs:] \"Desire His commandments greatly.\" [Desire His commandments] and not the reward [that comes from] His commandments...Anyone who occupies himself with the Torah in order to receive reward or in order to protect himself from retribution is considered as one who is not occupied for God's sake.[In contrast,] anyone who occupies himself with it, not because of fear, nor to receive a reward, but rather because of his love for the Lord of the entire earth, Who commanded it, is one who occupies himself for God's sake.<br>", "for from [the study of Torah which] is not carried out for God's sake - Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 17a) and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Ta'anit</i> 7a) note that the Talmud is extremely critical of those who do not occupy themselves with the Torah for God's sake.<br><i>Ta'anit</i> 7a declares that whenever a person does not study Torah for God's sake, the Torah becomes a deadly potion for him. <i>Berachot</i> 17a states that it would have been better for a person who does not study Torah for God's sake not to have been born. In resolution, the commentaries explain that there are two levels of occupying oneself with Torah that is not for God's sake:<br>a) to gain wealth, honor, or other benefits, as implied by the Rambam here;b) in order to vex a colleague.<br>Our Sages suggest occupation with Torah study even if it is not intended for God's sake, if one has the former motives. However, if one's motives are the latter, then our Sages' harsh words of criticism apply.<br>", "will come [the study of Torah which] is carried out for God's sake. - The introduction to <i>Eicha Rabbah</i> (2) quotes God as saying: \"Would that Israel abandon Me and keep the Torah...for its light would ultimately return them to the good.\" If a Jew frequently occupies himself with Torah, the inner Godly nature of Torah will eventually have an effect upon him and motivate him to serve God with the proper intentions.<br>There is a deeper aspect to this statement: The Hebrew <i>mitoch</i>, translated as \"from,\" also can be interpreted as \"from the inner part.\" Every element of a Jew's life is motivated by his Godly potential. Though he may think he is performing a mitzvah for selfish intent, the inner core of that service, its <i>toch</i>, is the Jew's desire to cling to God without any ulterior motive.<br>The Rambam elaborates on the principle that selfish desires can be used as motivation for involvement in Torah in his Commentary on the Mishnah, in his introduction to the tenth chapter of <i>Sanhedrin</i>:<br>When a young child is brought to a teacher to be taught the Torah, this is the greatest good for him, [allowing him] to attain fulfillment. However, because of his youth and underdeveloped intellect, [the child] does not comprehend this good...Therefore, it is necessary for the teacher...to motivate him to his studies with things that he loves...He should tell him: \"I will give you nuts, figs, or a little honey.\" It is out of this motivation that the child [begins to] study. [The child studies] not because of the essence of the study, for the child has no comprehension of that, but because of the food. Eating these delicacies is more important to him than the actual study...When he becomes older and his intellect grows to the point where he realizes the worthlessness of these items, he should be encouraged and motivated to learn by the promise of things he holds dear. His teacher should tell him: \"Study and I will buy you nice shoes or beautiful garments.\" Thus, he will study, not for the sake of the study itself, but for the garment, the garment becoming more valuable for him than the Torah...<br>The Rambam continues mentioning other factors that may be employed to motivate older children - e.g., money or honor. He concludes:<br>All this is degrading. Nevertheless, because of the limits of a person's intellect, it may be necessary to make the goal of wisdom something other than wisdom.<br>In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also emphasizes how a teacher must slowly mold a child's character and lead him, step by step, to an appreciation of the proper motives for the service of God:<br>As their knowledge grows and their wisdom increases, this secret [service of God for His sake] should be revealed to them [slowly,] bit by bit. They should become accustomed to this concept gradually, until they grasp it and know it and begin serving [God] out of love.<br>"], "Torah Study 3.6": ["A person whose heart inspires him to fulfill this mitzvah in a fitting manner - As explained in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 8, the Rambam's statements imply that there are two aspects of Torah study:a) The obligation to study Torah, which is incumbent on every individual: the establishment of fixed times for Torah study (Chapter 1, Halachah 8).b) A commitment to devote oneself to Torah study that has no limitations.<br>The first aspect reflects a commitment that takes into consideration man's perspective, and, hence, is limited in scope. However, when a person views the Torah from God's perspective and appreciates its infinite nature, he will be inspired to make an unbounded commitment to Torah study.

However, it is often the only path with which one can attain that goal.<br>Frequently, earning enough to live a life of comfort takes so much time that one will not be able to devote himself to Torah study in a fitting manner. Furthermore, indulgence in comfort often leads a person to preoccupation with his own needs and desires. Suddenly, he becomes faced with an entire host of \"necessities,\" without which he cannot continue.<br>", "The task is not incumbent upon you to complete - If a person contemplates the totality of Torah knowledge which there is to grasp, he may be intimidated and unwilling to begin such an undertaking. Hence, he is counselled that he is not expected to complete its study. However,...<br>", "nor are you free to desist from it. - and must endeavor to accomplish whatever you can.<br>", "If you have acquired much Torah, you have acquired much reward - The Mishnah continues to explain that the reward for the righteous will be in the world to come.<br>It is difficult to understand why the Rambam emphasizes the aspect of reward, when in the previous halachah he stressed how one should not study Torah for ulterior motives. Included in the latter is also the reward in the world to come.<br>", "and that reward is commensurate with the difficulty [invested]. - In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam interprets this to mean: \"Your reward will be commensurate with the effort invested in Torah study.\" See also Halachah 12, which elaborates on the nature of the effort a person must invest in his Torah studies.<br>In his introduction to <i>Avot</i>, Chapter 6, the Rambam offers a slightly different interpretation: \"A person's reward will be commensurate with the effort necessary to overcome his natural inclination.\"<br>"], "Torah Study 3.7": ["Perhaps, one will say: \"[I will interrupt my studies] until after I gather money, and then I will return and study, [I will interrupt my studies] until after I buy what I need, and then, when I can divert my attention from my business, I will return and study.\" - Note Chapter 1, Halachah 5, which counsels studying Torah before marriage, so the yoke of financial responsibility will not interfere with one's studies.<br>", "If you consider such thoughts, you will never merit the crown of Torah. - The commentaries have offered two reasons why such an individual will never merit \"the crown of Torah:\"a) Desire is never satisfied. \"Whoever possesses one hundred, desires two hundred; whoever possesses two hundred, desires four hundred\" (<i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 1:34). Once a person has given his material concerns priority over Torah study, it is very difficult for him to reverse his pattern and devote himself completely to Torah study.b) The time which he lost while involved in business cannot be recovered, and thus, he will never reach the heights of Torah knowledge that he could have attained beforehand.<br>", "Rather, make your work secondary, and your Torah study a fixed matter. - In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 1:14, the Rambam writes:<br>Make your Torah study of primary importance and all your other affairs secondary.

We have made our business affairs primary and our Torah study secondary, and have not achieved success in either.<br>Do not say: \"When I have free time, I will study,\" for perhaps, you will never have free time. - In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 2:5, the Rambam also associates this statement of Hillel's with the statement of Shammai quoted above.<br>"], "Torah Study 3.8": ["It is written in the Torah [Deuteronomy 30:12, 13]: - Rav Kapach renders this: \"It is written about the Torah,\" emphasizing that according to the Rambam, the antecedent of the pronoun \"it\" in the above verse is Torah study and not Teshuvah, as explained by the Ramban and others.<br>", "\"It is not in the heavens....It is not across the sea....\" [This implies:] \"It is not in the heavens\" - i.e., it is not found in the proud spirited. - and self-centered. Such an attitude runs contrary to the spirit of Torah and, ultimately, prevents one from grasping it, as explained in the following halachah.<br>", "\"It is not across the sea\" - i.e., it is not found in those who travel across the sea - for business purposes. In contrast, one is advised to travel to study Torah, as <i>Avot</i> relates: \"Exile yourself to a place of Torah.\"<br>", "Therefore, our Sages said: - <i>Avot</i> 2:5", "\"Not everyone who is involved in business will become wise.\" - In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam quotes the content of this halachah.<br>", "Our Sages also commanded: - <i>Avot</i> 4:12", "\"Minimize your business activities and occupy - The Hebrew, <i>la\u2019asok</i>, is also used in the Ashkenazic text of the blessings recited before Torah study. In most contexts, that word is rendered as \"business.\" Thus, employing it in the blessing implies that the manner in which a person applies himself to Torah study should resemble the way a businessman applies himself to his business, making it the central matter of his life.<br>", "yourself with Torah.\" - The practical applications of these concepts are found in the following halachah.<br>"], "Torah Study 3.9": ["The words of Torah can be compared to water, as [Isaiah 55:1] states: \"Behold, all who are thirsty, come to the water.\" - <i>Ta'anit</i> 7a mentions the ideas related by the Rambam as well as other dimensions of the comparison between Torah and water.<br>", "This teaches you that just as water does not collect on an incline, but rather flows from it and collects in a low place, similarly, the words of Torah will not be found in the arrogant or in the hearts of any the haughty - i.e., the nature of such a personality does not allow an individual to grasp the words of Torah. As obvious from the contrast with the humble, pride prevents one from grasping Torah for two reasons:a) A proud person will be less likely to make the effort necessary to open himself up to the instruction of a master;b) Pride often leads a person to material desire, whose pursuit will take a person away from devotion to Torah study.<br>", "but rather in the humble and lowly, who sit in the dust at the feet of the Sages - The Rambam borrows the phraseology of <i>Avot</i> 1:4. Others render the phrase: \"Become dusty [pursuing] the Sages' feet\" - i.e., follow them everywhere out of thirst to learn from them.<br>and remove the desires and pleasures of the times from their hearts - See Halachah 12.<br>", "They do only a minimal amount of work each day [to earn] their livelihood if they have nothing else to eat. - Note the narrative from <i>Yoma</i> 35b quoted in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 8, which describes Hillel's daily activities.<br>", "The rest of their days and nights - See Halachah 13.<br>", "are involved with Torah study."], "Torah Study 3.10": ["Anyone who comes to the conclusion that he should involve himself in Torah study without doing work and derive his livelihood from charity desecrates [God's] name - In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 5, and <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 1:4, the Rambam mentions the severity of the sin of desecrating God's name.<br>", "dishonors the Torah, extinguishes the light of faith, brings evil upon himself, and forfeits the life of the world to come, for it is forbidden to derive benefit from the words of Torah in this world. - See the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 7, which quotes the Rambam's commentary on <i>Avot</i> at length, strongly decrying the deriving of material benefit from one's Torah knowledge.<br>These convictions are also expressed in <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'yim</i> 10:18, which states:<br>Even a dignified Sage who becomes poor should work in a profession, even a degrading profession, rather than seek public assistance. It is better to skin the hides of dead animals than to tell the people, \"I am a Sage, support me.\"Our greatest Sages were wood-choppers, porters, water-drawers... They did not ask anything from the public and refused to accept anything that was given to them.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> takes issue with the Rambam's statements and states that there is no prohibition against a Torah Sage receiving support from others. Though the Rambam quotes many examples of sages who performed simple labors to earn their livelihood, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains how none of them can be taken to be conclusive proof of the Rambam's position.<br>For example, the Rambam quotes <i>Yoma</i> 35b, which relates how Hillel would do simple work to earn his sustenance. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Talmud's statements about Hillel were made before his greatness was appreciated. There is no proof that he continued working as a common laborer afterwards.<br>The practice of taking payment for Torah study has its source in <i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i> 106a, which relates that individuals who give up the opportunity to earn their livelihood in other professions so that they can teach Torah or serve as judges are able to receive remuneration, because, in essence, they are not receiving payment for their Torah, but for their time.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> concludes:<br>It is possible to explain that our master's intention is that a person should not cast off the yoke of labor in order to receive his livelihood from others in order to study. Rather, first, he should learn a profession with which he can sustain himself. If that is sufficient for him, it is good. If not, he may receive his livelihood from the community...Even if this is not our master's intention, as apparent from his Commentary on the Mishnah, whenever one is in doubt about the halachah, one should follow the custom. We have seen all the Sages of Israel, both before and after our master, accepting their livelihood from the community.Furthermore, even if the halachah followed our master..., it is possible that all the sages of the [previous] generations agreed to do so because...if the livelihood of the scholars and the teachers were not available, they would not be able to labor in Torah as is fitting, and the Torah would be forgotten, Heaven forbid. Since it is available, they are able to study, \"and Torah is magnified and becomes stronger.\"<br>These ideas are quoted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 246:5). It must be noted that even the Rambam (Chapter 6, Halachah 10, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>ibid.,Hilchot De'ot</i> 6:2) allows a person to give a sage money to invest, or to afford him other benefits in commerce and trade.<br>", "Our Sages declared: - <i>Avot</i> 4:5.<br>", "\"Whoever benefits from the words of Torah forfeits his life in the world.\" - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quoted above refers to the Rambam's commentary on this Mishnah. Major portions of the Rambam's statements are cited in our commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 7.<br>", "Also, they commanded and declared: - <i>Avot, ibid.</i> The Rambam reverses the order of the statements in the Mishnah, perhaps, because the first clause is more explicit. Alternatively, because chronologically, Hillel, the author of the latter clause, preceded Rabbi Tzadok, the author of the former.<br>", "\"Do not make them a crown to magnify oneself - a source of honor,<br>", "nor an axe to chop with.\" - i.e., a means of deriving a livelihood.<br>", "Also, they commanded and declared: - <i>Avot</i> 1:10.", "\"Love work and despise Rabbinic positions.\" - In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam writes: \"Without work, it will be difficult for him for him, and he will steal and cheat. Seeking positions of honor will bring about challenges.\"<br>Similarly, <i>Avot</i> 2:2 teaches:<br>", "\"All Torah that is not accompanied by work will eventually be negated and lead to sin.\" - That Mishnah begins: \"Torah is beautiful when accompanied by work.\"<br>", "Ultimately, such a person will steal from others. - The commentaries cite <i>Kiddushin</i> 29a: \"Whoever does not teach his son a profession is as if he taught him to steal,\" as the source for the Rambam's statements.<br>"], "Torah Study 3.11": ["It is a tremendous advantage for a person to derive his livelihood from his own efforts - and not from charity.<br>", "and is an attribute possessed by the pious of the first generations. - Among the examples of sages who worked as craftsmen mentioned in the Talmud are Rav Huna - a drawer of water (<i>Ketubot</i> 105a), Rabbi Meir - a barber (<i>Eruvin</i> 13a), Rabbi Yehudah - a porter (<i>Nedarim</i> 49b), and Rav Yosef - a miller, Rav Sheshet - a porter (<i>Gittin</i> 67b).<br>", "In this manner, one will merit all the honor - One of the rationales given by many of the Rabbis who permit scholars to derive benefit from their studies is that performing menial work will cheapen the common man's appreciation of them, and thus minimize the honor given to the Torah.<br>The Rambam (see the Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>ibid.</i>) holds the very opposite. The common people will respect a person who honestly earns his livelihood and will look down on a person who derives his income from charity.<br>", "and benefit in this world - i.e., God will grant him blessing and he will be able to earn a respectable income through his efforts.<br>In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 9:1, the Rambam elaborates how God will grant material blessings to a person who dedicates himself to Torah and mitzvot.

This continues the theme that the dedication to Torah study beyond one's nature is the key to acquiring Torah as one's own.<br>In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 5:19, the Rambam quotes this verse and interpretation, and associates it with the advice he gives teachers in Chapter 4, Halachah 5, to cast fear into the hearts of the students.<br>", "Our Sages declared: - Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1<br>", "A covenant has been established that anyone who wearies himself in Torah study in a house of study - Many manuscripts substitute \"in a synagogue,\" as is the text in the Jerusalem Talmud.<br>", "will not forget it quickly - i.e., the fact that study is carried out in a house of study itself contributes to its retention by the students. Accordingly, our Sages highly recommend that one study in a house of study (or at least in a synagogue) whenever possible. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, Hilchot Talmud Torah 4:10.)<br>", "Anyone who wearies himself in Torah study in private will become wise, as [Proverbs 11:2] states: \"To the modest will come wisdom.\" - It must be noted that <i>Berachot</i> 63b severely criticizes those who study Torah alone (when they have the opportunity to study with others). Similarly, in the following chapter, when the Rambam discusses the actual process of study, he continually refers to a teacher studying with many students.<br>", "Whoever raises his voice during his studies - The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1, emphasizes that one should not raise one's voice overly loud.<br>", "will permanently acquire the subject matter. - II Samuel 23:5 states: \"for He has made an everlasting covenant with me, ordered in all and preserved.\" <i>Eruvin</i> 54a interprets the \"everlasting covenant\" as a reference to the Torah, and states: \"If it is ordered in all a person's 248 limbs\" - i.e., if his entire body is involved in his study - \"it will be preserved.\"<br>The <i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 38, explains that a person who studies out loud and invests his energy in Torah study elevates his body and natural life force.<br><b>In contrast, one who reads silently will forget quickly. -</b> It is difficult to ignore the contrast between secular study, which is carried out in a silent library, and the study of Torah carried out in a noisy house of study, each person verbalizing the subject matter which he is studying.<br>Based on <i>Berachot</i> 15b and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 62:3, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 2:12) states that the study of Torah is comparable to other mitzvot associated with speech. A person cannot fulfill his obligation through mere thought, and must either vocalize the words himself or hear from someone else who reads out loud.<br>"], "Torah Study 3.13": ["Even though it is a mitzvah to study during the day and at night - See Chapter 1, Halachah 8.<br>", "it is only at night that a person acquires most of his wisdom. - <i>Eruvin</i> 65a states: \"The moon was created only for Torah study.\" The term \"wisdom\" is interpreted as a reference to those aspects of Torah study described as <i>Gemara</i> or <i>Talmud</i> (Chapter 1, Halachah 11). At night, when a person is removed from his daytime pressures, he is able to concentrate more on these abstract subjects.<br>", "Therefore, a person who desires to merit the crown of Torah - See the commentary on Halachah 1 with regard to the latter term.<br>", "should be careful with all his nights, not giving up even one to sleep - <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 4:4 states that a person should sleep eight hours each night. The commentaries have questioned whether here, the Rambam is advising a person to strain himself beyond those limits, or whether the Rambam is merely stating that the nighttime hours a person has available should be devoted to Torah study.<br>", "eating, drinking - In <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 5:1, the Rambam counsels: \"A Torah Sage should not be a glutton. Rather, he should eat only the foods that are appropriate for his physical health and [even of those], he should not partake excessively. He should not pursue [food] after filling his gut.\"<br>", "talk - In general, the Rambam advises against excessive speech. <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 2:4 states: \"A person should also remain silent to a great extent, and speak only about words of wisdom or things he requires to maintain his existence.\"<br>", "or the like. Rather, [they should be devoted to] the study of Torah and the words of wisdom.", "Our Sages declared: \"The song of Torah can [be heard] only at night, as [Eicha 2:19] states: 'Arise, sing out at night...\" - Note the commentaries on Deuteronomy 31:19, which describe the Torah as God's song.<br>", "Whoever occupies himself with Torah study at night will have a strand of [Divine] favor extended over him during the day, as [implied by Psalms 42:9]: \"During the day, God ordains His kindness and, at night, His song is with me, a prayer to the living God.\" - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3b comments: \"Why does 'God ordain His kindness during the day'?

Whoever maintains the Torah in poverty will ultimately maintain it amidst prosperity.\" -</b> In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam writes:<br>A person who studies Torah in poverty and need, straining himself to study despite these pressures, will ultimately merit to study amidst prosperity without any disturbances to his study.[Conversely,] a person who neglects Torah study because he is prosperous and, therefore, is busy eating, drinking, and seeking pleasure, will ultimately become poor to the extent that the reason he neglects Torah study will be his pursuit of his daily bread.<br><b>This concept is explicitly mentioned in the Torah [Deuteronomy 28:47-48], which states: \"Because you did not serve God, your Lord, with happiness and good feeling when there was an abundance of everything, you shall serve your enemies\" -</b> This interpretation of the verse resembles that of Rashi's commentary on the Torah. Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Lulav</i>, where the Rambam interprets the verse differently, stressing the importance of serving God with joy.<br><b>and [Deuteronomy 8:16] states: \"so that you shall suffer...so that ultimately He will make you prosper.\"<br></b><br>"], "Torah Study 2.1": ["Teachers of small children should be located in each and every land, in each and every region, and in each and every village. - <i>Bava Batra</i> 21a declares:<br>", "Remember that man for good! Yehoshua ben Gamla is his name. Were it not for him, the Torah would have been forgotten by the Jewish people.Originally, a person who had a father would be instructed by him, while a person who had no father would not be instructed...[Afterwards,] they instituted [the practice of] employing teachers of young children in Jerusalem [as implied by the verse]: \"From Zion shall go forth the Torah.\"Nevertheless, whoever had a father would be taken [to Jerusalem], while one who did not have a father would not be taken. [Therefore,] they instituted [the practice of] employing teachers in every region. They would begin study at sixteen or at seventeen.However, if a [student's] teacher were angry with him, he would scoff at him and leave. [This situation persisted] until Yehoshua ben Gamla came and instituted [the practice of] employing teachers of young children in each and every land, in each and every region, and in each and every village. They would bring them [to the schools] at the age of six or seven.This practice was continued in the subsequent generations. Even though the dispersion of the Jewish people and the subjugation to the gentile powers made the management of their communal affairs more difficult, throughout the ages we find references to the establishment of communal programs of education in both the codes of Jewish law and the chronicles of Jewish history. (See Ramah, <i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, 163:3; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:3.)<br>Originally, it was customary for the community to impose taxes to pay for the education of all the children, whether their parents were rich or poor. However, at present it has become customary for each parent to pay for his own child's education. However, if he lacks the financial means to do so, the community is obligated to accept this burden.<br>If a village does not have children who study Torah, the city's populace is placed under a ban of ostracism - See Chapter 7, Halachah 5 for a precise definition of this term.<br>", "until they employ teachers for the children. If - these measures do not motivate the inhabitants to change their ways and....<br>", "they do not employ teachers, the city [deserves to] be destroyed - The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Shabbat</i> 119b. Though our text of that passage differs slightly from the statements here, in the various commentaries and codes (e.g., the <i>She'eltot</i> of Rabbenu Achai Gaon, the <i>Halachot</i> of Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi), we find various versions of that passage. Hence, it is possible to assume that the Rambam's statements are a quote from his text of the Talmud.<br>", "for the world exists only by virtue of the breath coming from the mouths of children who study Torah. - for their breath is not tainted by sin (<i>Shabbat</i>, <i>ibid.</i>). Based on the latter statement, some authorities require the community to support children's study only until they reach bar-mitzvah, since afterwards they no longer possess this quality.<br>"], "Torah Study 2.2": ["Children should be brought to study [under a teacher's instruction] - As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 6 and the commentary on it, even before a child reached that age his father would teach him particular verses from the Torah.<br>", "at the age of six or seven - Note the passage from <i>Bava Batra</i> quoted in the previous halachah and the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 6.<br>", "according to the child's health and build. - This would determine when he would be able to begin the long and rigorous study program described in this halachah.<br>", "Below the age of six, he should not be brought [to a teacher]. - for he will not be able to absorb his studies (<i>Bava Batra</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).<br>At present, it is customary to send children to school at much earlier ages. They are not subjected to such a rigorous schedule and much of the time is devoted to activities other than actual study. Nevertheless, their presence in school is important to develop their character and commitment to Jewish values.<br>", "A teacher may employ corporal punishment to cast fear upon [the students]. - The advice that Proverbs 13:24 gives a father: \"He that spares the rod, hates his son,\" also applies to a teacher. Indeed, <i>Makkot</i> 8a equates a teacher to a father in this respect.<br><i>Makkot</i> 22b relates that Zechariah 13:6, \"What are these wounds?...Those which I was wounded in the house of my beloved,\" refers to the beatings administered to school children.<br>See also Chapter 3, Halachah 12 and Chapter 4, Halachah 5.<br>", "However, he should not beat them cruelly, like an enemy. - Note the parallel of this expression to Jeremiah 30:14. Note also Chapter 4, Halachot 4-5, which recommend restraint and patience on the teacher's part.<br>", "Therefore, he should not beat them with a rod or a staff, but rather with a small strap. - <i>Bava Batra</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) relates that Rav instructed Rav Shmuel bar Shilat (a well known teacher of children):<br>", "When you beat a child, beat him only with a sandal strap. If [it motivates him] to study, then he will study. If he does not study, let him be in the company of the others.From Rav's words, we can infer that corporal punishment may be employed to try to motivate a student to be more attentive. However, if it does not prove to be a successful tool, it should not be used further, lest it create a permanent aversion to Torah study.<br>[The teacher] should sit and instruct them the entire day and for a portion of the night, to train them to study during the day and night. - So that as adults, they will be accustomed to fulfilling the obligation mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 8.<br>", "The children should not neglect [their studies] at all, except at the end of the day on the eve of the Sabbaths and festivals - i.e., they should study on the mornings of these days, but not in the afternoons.<br>The commentaries have questioned the source for the Rambam's statements. Some have pointed to <i>Sukkah</i> 28a, which praises Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai for never leaving the house of study except on the eve of Pesach and the eve of Yom Kippur. Similarly, <i>Pesachim</i> 109a applies such praise to Rabbi Akiva. However, it is difficult to say that these are the sources for the Rambam's statements. Firstly, the passages refer to adults and not to children. Also, the fact that these passages cite the behavior of these Sages as worthy of praise seems to imply that it was exceptional and not the rule followed by most.<br>", "and on the festivals themselves. - for study might disturb a child's conception of the air of rejoicing and celebration that must accompany the festivals. It must be noted that the Rambam suggests that adults use some of their time on the festivals to study (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 6:19).<br>", "On the Sabbath - They should not cease their studies. Nevertheless...<br>", "they should not begin new material - for grasping it may involve difficulty and strain, which should be avoided on the Sabbath. (See <i>Nedarim</i> 37a.)<br>", "However, they should review what was learned already. - for this does not involve tremendous strain.<br>", "The children should never be interrupted from their studies, even for the building of the Temple. - <i>Shabbat</i> 119b makes this statement in the context of its description of the great merit of the children's study, as mentioned in the previous halachah. Indeed, this appears to be the Rambam's logic in the entire halachah. Since children's study is so important, no unnecessary interruptions should be made.<br>", "This rigorous schedule of study is not followed today. Among the reasons given are the different goals for Torah study at present from those in the previous generations, as described in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 12. Alternatively, if today youth were subjected to such a schedule, they might rebel and no value would come of it."], "Torah Study 2.3": ["A teacher of children who leaves the children and goes out - <i>Bava Batra</i> 8b relates that Rav once found Rav Shmuel bar Shilat strolling in a garden.

Furthermore, even now I am thinking about them.\"<br>", "or [remains] with them but performs other work - The commentaries have explained the source for this halachah as follows:<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>D'mai</i> 7:3) relates that Rabbi Yochanan encountered a teacher who looked emaciated. When the Sage enquired about him, his colleagues explained that he fasted. Rabbi Yochanan was very critical: \"If a normal hired worker is forbidden to undergo penances lest he not produce as much as desired, how much more so does this apply to someone doing God's work.\"<br>Accordingly, since we find that a person hired to do one job should not perform another at the same time (<i>Tosefta, Bava Metzia</i> 4:7), it can be assumed that a teacher should refrain from doing so.<br>", "or is lazy in their instruction - As is obvious from <i>Hilchot S'chirut</i> 10:7, this includes two elements:a) one who did not instruct the students; orb) one who erred in their instruction.<br>", "is included in [the admonition]: \"Cursed be he who performs God's work deceitfully\" [Jeremiah 48:10].

In his commentary on Psalms 45:2, Rav Sa'adiah Gaon translates that word as \"expert.\"<br>", "and instructs them carefully. - <i>Bava Batra</i> 21a-b emphasizes the importance of precise study by relating the following story:<br>", "After Yoav returned from slaying all the males of Edom (II Samuel 11:16 , King David asked him to explain his actions.

Though in other areas there are differences between these two categories of theft, in this context the same laws apply.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1), the Rambam explains that any of the species which are stolen may not be used for the mitzvah, because a sin may not serve as the medium with which a mitzvah will be performed (\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4).

Even according to the second opinion, the despair over recovering the article is not sufficient to allow the thief to use it, as is obvious from <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 2:1, where the Rambam writes:A stolen article whose form has not changed...even though its owner has despaired of its recovery...must be returned to its owner.Thus, the article is not considered to belong to the thief, and he may not use it to fulfill the mitzvah. However, if the thief performed a deed which changed the appearance of the lulav or any of the other species, he is considered to have acquired it and may fulfill the mitzvah with it.

In these instances, the nullification of the <i>ashera</i> will not cause it to be permitted for use; rather, it must be totally destroyed. Hence, it is considered to have no size at all, and, therefore, may not be used for the mitzvah (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).

However, Rabbenu Nissim and others differ and allow such an etrog to be used for the mitzvah in other places as well.

The commentaries explain that the Talmud refers to a shape like a tuning fork, where the two ends are distant from each other. The commentaries explain that such a separation can disqualify a lulav even if the majority of leaves are not split in this manner, and hence, the principles mentioned in the following halachah would not apply.<br>", "If it is bent forward - i.e., the <i>shidrah</i> would be bent toward a person facing it<br>", "so that its shidrah appears like a hunchback, it is unacceptable - <i>Sukkah</i> (ibid.) states: If it is bent like a scythe, it is unacceptable.

Rabbenu Manoach explains that this clause refers to the entire myrtle branch, stating that even though most of its leaves have fallen off, as long as it has one full row of leaves covering the branch (at its top, as in Chapter 7, Halachah 8), it is kosher.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 646:4) quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> statements as halachah. In contrast, Rabbenu Manoach's interpretation is not accepted. Halachah 5 (ibid.) states that the majority of the length of the myrtle branch must be covered with leaves. However, if that condition is met, the myrtle is kosher even if the leaves at its top have fallen off.<br>", "When there are more berries than leaves, [the following rules apply:] If they are green, it is kosher - for their color is the same as the leaves of the myrtle.<br>", "If they are red or black - since the berries are a different color from that of the leaves...<br>", "it is not acceptable - since this is not considered to be \"beautiful\" (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 33b).<br>", "If one reduced their number - so that there would be more leaves than berries,<br>", "it is acceptable.<br>", "We may not reduce their number - i.e., the number of black or red berries<br>", "on the holiday itself - i.e., on the first day of the festival, when the restrictions against work apply<br>", "because [by doing so, one] makes [the myrtle] fit for use - and this may not be done on a holiday.

They explain that such a myrtle is acceptable because its leaves cover the branch's severed top. This concept does not apply with regard to a willow.

However, they state that when it is difficult to find a kosher etrog, the Rambam's opinion may be relied upon.<br>", "no matter how small the hole is - i.e., even if it was perforated with a thin needle<br>", "it is not acceptable. - This and the other factors mentioned in this halachah disqualify an etrog for use because it is not \"beautiful.\"<br>The Ra'avad objects to this statement and maintains that some of the etrog's substance must also be lacking for it to be deemed unacceptable. The difference between these two opinions depends on a difference in the text of the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:6). The Rambam's text reads:If [an etrog] was perforated, peeled, cracked, or lacking even the slightest amount of its substance, it is unacceptable.In contrast, the Ra'avad's text read:If [an etrog] was perforated, peeled, cracked: when it lacks even the slightest amount of its substance, it is unacceptable.The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 2) follows the Rambam's view.

In this context, it refers to bumps which protrude above the etrog's surface. However, the commentaries disqualify an etrog only if the bumps grow naturally from the etrog itself. However, if they are caused by external factors - e.g., thorns - the etrog is not disqualified.<br>", "in two or three places - The Ra'avad asks why both the numbers two and three are mentioned. In response, the <i>Mishneh Lamelech</i> quotes many examples of the use of similar terminology throughout the Talmud.

Thus, if an etrog has been soaked in water or in any other liquid for more than 24 hours straight, it is considered to be \"pickled\" and disqualified for use.

As it matures, it turns yellowish.<br>", "If it was grown in a mold and shaped into the form of another creation, it is unacceptable - It is not considered \"beautiful\" because its natural form was changed (Rabbenu Manoach).<br>", "If its natural form was preserved, even though it was shaped in different layers, it is kosher. Two etrogim that grow joined together - This is kosher because the etrogim grew naturally in this way. In this instance, when performing the mitzvah, a person should hold both etrogim in his hands. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 20) accepts this decision, there are other authorities who differ. Hence, it is preferable to use another etrog (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 648:63).<br>", "and an unripe etrog are kosher. - <i>Sukkah</i> 31b mentions etrogim which are small and green as being not fully ripe.

From this incident, our Sages concluded that, on the later days, even such an etrog is kosher.<br>According to the Rambam's opinion, the same applies to all other physical blemishes on the species. Since there is no greater blemish than an etrog which is bitten into, none of the requirements for \"beauty\" must be observed on the later days.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 29b and Rabbenu Asher maintain that this leniency applies only to etrogim which are lacking in substance.

However, those who follow the first opinion (the Ra'avad, the Ramban, Rabbenu Asher) forbid the use of stolen species on the later days as well. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) quotes the Rambam, while the Ramah follows the other view.<br>[Though the above explanation is frequently used, it is difficult to accept. First, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1), the Rambam mentions the reason of \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4. Also, in <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:7 and in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbe'ach</i> 5:7 and 5:9, he forbids the use of stolen articles for the performance of a commandment. In addition, he has not yet mentioned the halachah requiring one to own the lulav used on the first day.<br>The <i>Taz</i> (649:15) clarifies the matter slightly further by explaining that since taking the lulav on the second day is only a Rabbinic commandment, using a stolen lulav is allowed even though it is a \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4.]<br>", "On the second day of the festival - The literal translation of the Rambam's words are \"from the second holiday,\" implying that these leniencies are granted even in the Diaspora, where the second day is celebrated as a holiday. Though all the laws of the holiday apply on the second day as well as the first, this applies only to the laws of the holiday itself. In contrast, in other contexts, since we follow a fixed calendar and know that the holidays fall on their appropriate dates, the restrictions applying to the first day do not apply on the subsequent days (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>Rabbenu Asher differs and maintains that all the restrictions that apply to the lulav on the first day must also be observed on the second day as well. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 649:5) writes that all the species disqualified on the first day may be taken on the second day, but a blessing should not be recited.<br>", "and on the other days - <i>Chol Hamo'ed</i>, when all opinions agree that...<br>", "they are all kosher.<br>", "Those which are disqualified because of the association with idol worship - mentioned in Halachah 1<br>", "or because the etrog is forbidden to be eaten - as mentioned in Halachah 2<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.10": ["On the first day of the festival - It appears from the Rambam's statements that even in Jerusalem, where Torah law requires that the mitzvah be fulfilled for all seven days of the festival, the obligation to own the lulav applies only on the first day.<br>", "a person cannot fulfill his obligation by using a lulav that belongs to a colleague and was borrowed from him - As explained in the commentary on the previous halachah, the Biblical source for the mitzvah of taking the four species, Leviticus 23:40, states: \"On the first day, take for yourself the fruit of a beautiful tree...\" The phrase \"for yourself\" implies that a person must own the species he uses for the mitzvah (<i>Sukkah</i> 41b).<br>As mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 25, a borrowed sukkah may be used on the holiday. Though Deuteronomy 16:13 states \"Celebrate the Sukkot holiday", "for yourself for seven days.\" In this context, only a stolen sukkah is disqualified and a borrowed sukkah is permitted (<i>Sukkah</i> 27b).<br>Since in both cases, the source for the exclusion is the same phrase, one might ask why the laws pertaining to each are different. Many explain that since, as explained in the commentary to that halachah, the Torah includes a special verse to teach us that a borrowed sukkah is permitted, the scope of the exclusion implied by \"for yourself\" is limited.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 637:3 explains that since the person owning the sukkah grants his colleague the use of it, the borrowed sukkah can be considered \"as his own.\" Since a person has to treat a sukkah as his permanent dwelling for the seven days of the holiday, it follows that the sukkah was lent for that purpose. Thus, while a person is using it, he may consider it \"as his own,\" i.e., just like his own dwelling. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 19.<br>", "unless the latter gives it to him as a present. - Though there are certain restrictions against the transfer of property on a holiday, it is permitted to give a colleague a present (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 3:11).<br>", "If [the owner of the lulav] gives it to him as a present on the condition - The use of the Hebrew term \u05e2\u05dc \u05de\u05e0\u05ea frees one from certain obligations in phrasing the terms of the conditional agreement. (See <i>Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah</i> 3:8.)<br>", "that he return it, he may fulfill his obligation with it and return it - There are authorities who require that the owner specifically state that he is giving the lulav to his colleague on the condition that the latter return it. However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 658:5) states that even if the owner gives a colleague a lulav without making such a statement, it is assumed that the lulav was given subject to this condition.<br>", "for a present given on condition that it be returned is considered a present. - See <i>Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah</i> 3:9.<br>", "If he does not return it, he does not fulfill his obligation, because it is as though it were stolen. - i.e., by failing to fulfill the condition under which the present was given, the recipient nullifies the legal transfer of ownership. Thus, although he was in physical possession of the article, it did not belong to him. Hence, it is considered to be stolen and, thus, not eligible to be used for the mitzvah (<i>Sukkah</i>, ibid.).<br>", "[On the first day,] - before all the adults who desire to use it have fulfilled the mitzvah (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid. 6)<br>", "a lulav should not be given to a minor - The definition of the term \"minor\" in this context has been the subject of debate among the Rabbis. From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he includes all minors in this category. However, Rabbenu Nissim writes that a child of six or seven can transfer property and, hence, his return of the lulav is valid.<br>Support for Rabbenu Nissim's position is brought from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:10), which relates that Rav Nachman bar Ya'akov gave his etrog as a present to his son and told him: \"When you take possession of it and fulfill the mitzvah, return it to me.\" Nevertheless, the passage does not serve as conclusive proof, because the possibility exists that his son had already reached majority. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 6) follows the Rambam's view.<br>", "since, according to Torah law, a minor can acquire articles - which are given to him by others who consciously desire that the minor acquire the property, in contrast to ownerless articles, which he cannot acquire according to Torah law (<i>Maggid Mishneh, Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah</i> 4:7).<br>", "but cannot transfer them to others. - The transfer of the ownership of an article requires a conscious decision. Torah law maintains that a child lacks intellectual maturity (\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea), and thus is incapable of making such a decision.<br>", "Thus, [the minor's] return of the article is not considered to be a return [from a legal perspective]. - i.e., although he has physically returned the article, the child still remains the legal owner.<br>The <i>Machaneh Ephraim</i> (<i>Hilchot Meshichah</i> 2) notes that according to Rabbinic law, a child can transfer property that he owns to another. Thus, the Rambam's statements seem to imply that any of the four species that are acquired only according to Rabbinic law may not be used for this mitzvah.<br>A very practical point can be derived from this concept. According to Torah law, property that is purchased changes ownership only after it has been paid for. The completion of a transaction when the property are taken by the purchaser (<i>meshichah</i>) is a Rabbinic institution. Accordingly, if a person purchased a lulav and etrog on the condition that he pay for it after the holiday - even though the seller willingly consented - the purchaser has only acquired the lulav and etrog according to Rabbinic law. Thus, based on this halachah, he would not be able to use it for the mitzvah.<br>", "The above applies to the lulav and to each of the other species of the four taken with it. - The verse quoted above includes all the four species, and not only the lulav. Therefore...<br>", "If one of them was borrowed, the person does not fulfill his obligation on the first day of the festival.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.11": ["When partners purchase a lulav or etrog together, neither is - considered to be the owner of the species in its entirety. Therefore, neither is...<br>", "able to fulfill his obligation with it on the first [day of the festival] - <i>Bava Batra</i> 137b relates that the requirement of owning a lulav includes not only having a share in it, but rather owning it entirely.<br>", "unless his colleague gives him his portion as a present. - The principles mentioned in the previous halachah regarding giving a lulav as a present also apply to giving a share of it as a present.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions a very frequent application of this concept: a lulav and etrog purchased by a synagogue for the use of all of its members. He quotes the Rashba, who explains that since the etrog was purchased with the intent that it be used by each member of that community, implicit in their agreement is that, on the first day, it will belong to each individual entirely at the time he uses it to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 648:7) quotes this statement as halachah. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 648:10 raises questions concerning it and suggests that each member of the community should grant his colleague his share as a present.<br>", "Should brothers purchased etrogim from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet: - This is the case mentioned in <i>Bava Batra</i> (ibid.), from which the above principle is derived. In such an instance, the estate is considered to be the mutual property of all the brothers concerned.<br>", "If one of them takes an etrog with the intent of fulfilling his obligation, [the following rules apply:] If he could eat it without the other brothers objecting - it is considered to be his own. Hence,...<br>", "he has fulfilled his obligation. If they would object - and require that an equal division of the property be made before it was used, he cannot be considered to be the full owner of the etrog. Hence,...<br>", "he does not fulfill his obligation until they give him their share [in the etrog] as a present.<br>The above principles apply only when the funds of the estate were used to purchase a number of etrogim. Since many fruits of the same species were purchased with the money from the estate, it is possible that the other brothers will not object to one brother's taking an etrog for his own use. However, if the money of the estate was used to buy a number of different species of fruit - e.g.,...<br>", "If one brother bought an etrog and another a quince, or together they bought an etrog, a pomegranate, and a quince from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet - we assume that the brothers would desire to have the property formally divided before using it. Hence, they are all considered to be mutual owners of the fruit. Thus,...<br>", "one cannot fulfill one's obligation with the etrog until the others give him their share [in it] as a present, even though they would not object to his [use of it].<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.12": ["Even though it is a mitzvah to rejoice on all the festivals - as Deuteronomy 16:14 teaches: \"And you shall rejoice on your festivals.\" Though that verse is mentioned with regard to Sukkot, Deuteronomy 16:11 states with regard to Shavuot: \"and you shall rejoice before God,\" and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4b explains that an analogy is established to include Pesach as well.<br>", "there was an additional celebration in the Temple on the festival of Sukkot - The Rambam's words present a question: The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1) refers to this celebration as <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>, connecting it with the drawing of water for the water libation. (See <i>Hilchot T'midim Umusafim</i> 10:6-10.) Indeed, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 50b; see also the Rambam's commentary on the above-mentioned Mishnah) emphasizes that connection, quoting Isaiah 12:3: \"And you shall draw water with happiness.\" However, here, the Rambam makes no mention of that water at all!<br>We are forced to say that the Rambam views the verse from Isaiah as a mere <i>asmachtah</i> (an allusion from the Bible with which our Sages connected a verse to an independent concept) and that the celebration came about because of the unique nature of the Sukkot festival. Though this celebration was associated with the water libation, the latter is not the source for the practice. Indeed, the choice of the name <i>Simchat Beit HaSho'evah</i> (the celebration of the house of drawing the water), and not <i>Simchat Hasho'evah</i> (the celebration of the drawing of the water) allows for such an interpretation. (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XVII).<br>", "as [Leviticus 23:40] commands: \"And you shall rejoice<br>", "before God, your Lord - i.e., in the Temple<br>", "for seven days.\" - Although this verse is used to derive the requirement of taking the lulav in Jerusalem for each of the seven days of the festival (Chapter 7, Halachah 13), its simple meaning remains.<br>Nevertheless, this charge is not considered to be an independent commandment, but rather an extension (and an intensification) of the mitzvah of celebrating on the festivals. Thus, in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 54), the Rambam describes that mitzvah and explains that it includes \"to celebrate with musical instruments and to dance in the Temple....This is <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>.\"<br>This explanation resolves another question: <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 8b teaches that one celebration should not be interposed upon another. For this reason, weddings are not held during the festivals so that the wedding celebrations should not clash with those of the festival.<br>Thus, were one to consider the celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> as associated with the water offering, one might ask why the Sages instituted such a celebration which might appear to overshadow the celebration of the festival itself. However, the above explanation resolves this difficulty as well, for as stated above, the <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> celebration is an extension of the festival celebrations and not an independent matter. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, ibid.)<br>", "What was done? On the eve of the first day of the festival - Two reasons are given why the courtyard was not set up during the festival itself:<br>a) It involved construction, which is forbidden on Chol Hamo'ed (<i>Knesset Hagedolah</i>)<br>b) Preparing the courtyard before the festival would allow the celebrations to begin immediately after the departure of the festival (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).<br>", "they would set up a place in the Temple - in the open courtyard before the entrance to the Temple courtyard proper. This was called <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> - the women's courtyard - because in contrast to the Temple courtyard, women were allowed to enter the <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> even when they were not offering sacrifices. The Rambam describes the <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> in <i>Hilchot Beit Habechirah</i> 5:7.<br>", "where women [could watch] from above, and men from below, so they would not intermingle with each other. - Originally, the men and the women would stand in separate sections on the same level. However, the Sages feared that, particularly during a time of celebration, such closeness might lead to frivolous interaction between the sexes, and decided to have a balcony constructed for the women (<i>Sukkah</i> 51b).<br>", "The celebration would begin on the night after the first day of the festival. - Since, as explained in the following halachah, the celebration was not held on the first night of the festival.<br>", "Similarly, on each day of Chol Hamo'ed, after offering the daily afternoon sacrifice, they would begin to celebrate for the rest of the day and throughout the night. - <i>Sukkah</i> 53a quotes Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananyah as saying: \"While we were celebrating at <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>, our eyes saw no sleep.\"<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.13": ["What was the nature of this celebration? - The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1-2) states:Whoever has not seen <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> has never seen rejoicing in his life!...<br>There were golden candelabras....There was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that was not illuminated with the light of <i>Beit Hasho'evah</i>.<br>The pious and men of stature would dance before them with torches of fire in their hands and recite songs of praise. The Levites would play the harps, lutes, cymbals, and all other types of instruments on the steps...leading down from the Israelites' courtyard.", "The flute would be sounded - Indeed, from the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1), which states: \"The flute, for five or six days; this was the flute of <i>Beit Hasho'evah</i>,\" it appears that this was the major element of the celebration.<br>", "and songs played on the harp, lute, and cymbals. [In addition,] each person would play on the instrument which he knew. Those who could sing, would sing. - See the quote from the Mishnah above.<br>", "They would dance and clap their hands, letting loose and whistling, each individual in the manner which he knew. Words of song and praise were recited. - Note the following halachah and commentary.<br>", "This celebration does not supersede either the Sabbath or the festival [prohibitions]. - Since, as explained above, the celebration involved musical instruments, it would not be held on the first night of the festival (or on the Sabbath), when playing such instruments is forbidden (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 23:4).<br>The celebration is an extension of a Torah commandment, while the above prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature. Furthermore, it was held in the Temple, where Rabbinic prohibitions of this nature were usually suspended (\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05de\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9, <i>Pesachim</i> 65a).

Other Sages would also participate. For example, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would juggle eight torches of fire and bow down so low he could kiss the ground. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:3) relates how Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzedek would perform unique feats of jumping.<br>", "However, the entire people - the men and the women - would come to see and hear - deriving joy from this passive participation.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.15": ["The happiness with which a person should rejoice in the fulfillment of the mitzvot and the love of God who commanded them is a great service. - By mentioning this concept at the conclusion - but as part - of the these halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the celebration of the festivals is not just an isolated experience, but rather is intended to influence the totality of our service of God. The rejoicing of the festival of Sukkot enables us to appreciate true happiness in all aspects of our Torah service.<br>", "Whoever holds himself back from this rejoicing is worthy of retribution, as [Deuteronomy 28:47] states: \"...because you did not serve God, your Lord, with happiness and a glad heart.\" - This verse comes after the full description of the curses and retribution which God will visit upon the Jewish people for their sins. From the Rambam's statements, it appears that it is the lack of happiness in the service of God, and not the sins themselves, which brought about this punishment.<br>The <i>Ari</i>, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, explains that even though the punishment comes for the sins, had the Jewish people served God with true joy and happiness, that happiness would have caused Him to overlook those transgressions, regardless of how serious they were. In contrast, a lack of happiness in the performance of the mitzvot demonstrates a deficiency in the person's awareness of the connection to God established thereby.<br>", "Whoever holds himself proud, giving himself honor, and acts haughtily in such situations is a sinner and a fool - for he is concerned with himself, rather than with God.<br>", "Concerning this, Solomon warned [Proverbs 28:10]: \"Do not seek glory before the King.\" - i.e., God, in whose presence we are at every moment.<br>", "[In contrast,] anyone who lowers himself and thinks lightly of his person in these situations - transcending his self-consciousness and committing himself to God totally, without any restrictions<br>", "is [truly] a great person, worthy of honor - his ability to open himself up to God allows him to serve as a medium for the expression of His greatness, and thus, his own personal prestige rises, because, as our Sages commented: \"A king's servant is like a king.\"<br>", "who serves God out of love. - See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, Chapter 10.<br>", "Thus, David, King of Israel - The mention of David's position further emphasizes the concept explained. Alternatively, a king has a connection to each of his subjects. Thus, mentioning the example of the king of Israel emphasizes how each Jew has a potential to achieve this rung of service.<br>", "declared [II Samuel 6:22]: \"I will hold myself even more lightly esteemed than this and be humble in my eyes,\" because there is no greatness or honor other than celebrating before God, as [II Samuel 6:16] states: \"King David was dancing wildly and whistling before God.\" - When Michal, Saul's daughter, witnessed David's recklessness and total lack of inhibitions, she reproved him for conduct unbefitting a king. David answered her sharply, explaining that it is precisely this ability to give oneself totally over to Godliness which characterizes a Jewish monarch and makes him fit to lead the people in the service of God.<br>Though the Rambam stresses how an approach of humility and happiness befits people of honor - as is obvious from the nature of the Sages' celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> - these ideas also apply to every Jew. When an individual is conscious of God's constant presence, he will naturally be infused with these two emotions. He will feel his own smallness in God's presence, yet he will also feel real joy at the knowledge that God is with him at every moment, and that through his service of Torah and mitzvot, he can develop a greater connection with Him.<br>May our service of God with joy hasten the time when \"crowned with eternal joy\" (Isaiah 35:10 , we will be able to \"rejoice before God, your Lord, for seven days,\" in the Messianic Temple.

Seemingly, the intent is that since the time is not favorable, it is unwise to invest money and effort in commercial endeavors (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).<br>There are, however, authorities who maintain that here also, the restriction involves only commercial activity associated with joy - e.g., preparing for a child's wedding or purchasing valuable articles, but ordinary business activities are permitted (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:18).<br>", "construction projects associated with joy - e.g., those involving decorative patterns on the ceilings and walls - In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 1:7), the Rambam states that this refers to ornate buildings erected by the wealthy. There is, however, no restriction on ordinary building projects necessary for one's everyday purposes.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:7) describes the prohibition as applying to \"buildings of joy.\" The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:18 (based on the <i>Tur</i>) explains that this refers to all buildings that are unnecessary and are constructed for beauty and comfort.<br>", "plantings - In this instance, the differences between Hebrew and English have caused our translation to be non-literal. In Hebrew, the word \u05e0\u05d8\u05d9\u05e2\u05d4 refers to both planting trees and setting up tents.<br>", "associated with joy - e.g., that of myrtle trees - In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that this refers to spice and flower gardens planted for pleasure. One may, however, plant orchards for the purpose of growing fruit. There are no restrictions on such activity.<br>", "and the erection of tents. - This also refers to tents set up for festive purposes; there is no restriction against pitching tents for ordinary purposes.<br>", "We also minimize betrothals and marriages - The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575) interprets this to mean that a person who has fulfilled the mitzvah of fathering children should not become betrothed or marry at all.<br>", "unless one has not fulfilled the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying. - This involves fathering a son and a daughter. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 15:4.)<br>", "Whoever has fulfilled this mitzvah is forbidden to engage in sexual relations in a year of famine. - <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a derives this concept from Genesis 41:50, which states that Joseph's children were born before the famine. One can infer that during the famine he did not engage in relations.<br>This restriction was instituted because it is proper to reduce our indulgence in pleasure in a time of communal distress.<br>", "We also reduce the exchange of greetings, and the Torah sages should not exchange greetings at all. - Needless to say, frivolity and jests are also forbidden.<br>", "Rather, [they should conduct themselves as people] who have been rebuffed and ostracized by God. - A person under a ban of ostracism is forbidden to greet others or to return greetings. Hence the above prohibition.<br><i>Ta'anit</i> 14b states that it is proper to cover one's head with a cloak as mourners do. Nevertheless, neither the Rambam nor the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes this obligation (perhaps because even mourners did not generally observe this custom after the Talmudic era).<br>", "When a common person greets them, they may return the greeting - lest the person become offended (Rashi, <i>Ta'anit</i> 14b); but when doing so, they should respond<br>", "in a weak and concerned tone - so that he will appreciate that the greeting was not in place.<br>"], "Fasts 3.9": ["The Torah scholars alone continue to fast - The commentaries do not mention whether it is preferable that all the students of the Torah join in these fasts, as was stated in Halachah 1. One might presume, however, that they should. Indeed, the entire community should have been required to observe these fasts, and it is only because the Rabbis thought that this would be too difficult for them that they were released from this obligation.<br>", "[beginning on the next] Monday, [and continuing on the following] Thursday and Monday - As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 5, and in Halachah 3 of this chapter, there are opinions that maintain that if a cycle of fasts ends on Monday - as does the cycle of the seven communal fasts - the next cycle of fasts may be started on the Thursday of that week. Other opinions - and these are followed by the standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> - maintain that all cycles of fasts begin on Monday. Hence, if a cycle of fasts ends on Monday, the next cycle begins on the following Monday.<br>This difference of opinion involves much more than one day, for these fasts are decreed in series of three. Thus, according to the opinion followed by the standard texts, the scholars would fast three days in every two weeks for the duration of the period. The other view, in contrast, would require them to fast on every Monday and Thursday.<br>", "[in this manner] until the month of Nisan - <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:7 states that these fasts should continue \"until Nisan passes.\" In the Jerusalem Talmud's explanation of this Mishnah, it is explained that this refers to Nisan<br>", "as determined in relation to the spring season - which always begins in the month of Nisan. In <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 9:3, the Rambam defines the beginning of spring as the time the sun enters the zodiac constellation of the goat. This is the beginning of April according to the secular calendar.<br>", "passes. This is not, however, required of the community. No more than these thirteen communal fasts are decreed because of a lack of rainfall. - <i>Ta'anit</i> 14b considered thirteen fasts as the maximum a community should be required to undertake for this reason. More fasts would be considered an excessive burden. (Significantly, according to Kabbalah, the number thirteen is identified with God's attributes of mercy.)<br>As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4, this limit applies only regarding fasts decreed because of a lack of rain. When communal fasts are decreed because of other distressing circumstances, we should continue fasting until our prayers are answered.<br>", "When these individuals fast until Nisan passes, they are allowed to eat at night - i.e., the fast begins at dawn. See Chapter 1, Halachah 8.<br>", "and are allowed to perform work, to wash, to anoint themselves, to engage in sexual relations, and to wear shoes as on other fast days. - These restrictions apply only on Yom Kippur, Tish'ah B'Av, and the latter ten fasts decreed because of a lack of rain.<br>", "They do not fast on Rashei Chodashim, nor on Purim. - As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 9, an individual should not fast on these days. Although many individuals may participate in these fasts, they are still deemed individual - and not communal - fasts.<br>", "After the month of Nisan, as determined in relation to the spring season, passes - i.e. - one month after the spring season begins<br>", "when the sun enters the sign - i.e., the zodiac constellation<br>", "of the bull - This is at the beginning of the secular month of May.<br>", "they should cease fasting. Since no rain has descended from the beginning of the year, rain in this season would be a sign of a curse. - Since the land has already become parched, the rain will be of no benefit. For God to display His beneficence at such a time, after the time had passed when the rain could have helped, is a further sign of Divine disfavor (Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro).<br>"], "Human Dispositions 6.1": ["It is natural for a man's character and actions - As the Rambam emphasizes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8), man's ethical makeup is a combination of character and action.<br>", "to be influenced by his friends and associates and for him to follow the local norms of behavior. - People are, by nature, social beings and there is a constant give and take between the individual and the people with whom he associates (See Guide To the Perplexed, Vol. I, Chapter 31).<br>", "Therefore, - This sociological truism implies the following course of action.<br>", "he should associate with the righteous and be constantly in the company of the wise, - <i>Avot</i> 1:4 advises: \"Let your house be a meeting place for the wise.\" See the following halachah.<br>", "so as to learn from their deeds. - In Halachah 2, the Rambam states that it is a mitzvah to associate with the righteous, while here he describes the need for such association as morally compelling. Note our commentary to that halachah.<br>", "Conversely, he should keep away from the wicked who walk in darkness, so as not to learn from their deeds. - <i>Avot</i> 1:7 states: \"Stay away from a bad neighbor and do not become a friend of the wicked.\" (See also the Rambam's commentary to that Mishnah.)<br>", "This is [implied by] Solomon's statement (Proverbs 13:20 : \"He who walks with the wise will become wise, - <i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezar</i> (Chapter 25) explains this verse with an analogy of a person who spends time in a perfumery. Some of the pleasant fragrance attaches itself to him, even though he does not purchase anything.<br>", "while one who associates with fools will suffer.\" - <i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezar</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) continues the analogy: Conversely, when a person spends time in a tannery, the unpleasant odor of the tannery imparts a foul smell even though he did not take anything from there.<br>", "Similarly, [Psalms 1:1] states: \"Happy is the man who has not followed the advice of the wicked.\" - The verse from Proverbs supports the previously stated concept that a person is influenced by his environment. The verse from Psalms introduces the concept which follows; that bad company should be avoided.<br>A person who lives in a place where the norms of behavior are evil and the inhabitants do not follow the straight path should move to a place where the people are righteous - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXIII, states that this restriction does not apply to a person who settles in a community for the expressed purpose of spreading Torah. He need not worry about being influenced by his surroundings, because, to borrow a concept from <i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Chapter 69, out of context, \"one who is preoccupied with giving will not receive.\"<br>", "and follow the ways of the good. - See the commentary to Chapter 1, Halachah 4.<br>In <i>Iggeret HaShmad</i>, the Rambam states that even when the difference between the two is relative, \"a person who fears God is obligated to move from a country whose norms are not so proper to a good country.\"<br>If all the places with which he is familiar and of which he hears reports follow improper paths, as in our times, - One can only guess what the Rambam would say about our present society.<br>", "or if he is unable to move to a place where the patterns of behavior are proper, because of [the presence of] bands of raiding troops, or for health reasons, - The Rambam apparently does not suggest risking one's life to make such a move. However, note the passage from <i>Iggeret HaShmad</i> quoted below.<br>", "he should remain alone in seclusion - The obligation to find a proper society is not offered simply as a suggestion. The Rambam makes it a firm directive, incumbent upon us even if great difficulty must be endured to ensure that the improper society be avoided.<br>", "as [Eichah 3:28] states: \"Let him sit alone and be silent.\"", "If they are wicked and sinful and do not allow him to reside there unless he mingle with them and follow their evil behavior, he should go out to caves, thickets, - This phrase is borrowed out of context, as is frequently the Rambam's practice, from I Samuel 13:6: \"and the people hid in the caves and crannies.\"<br>and deserts [rather than] follow the paths of sinners - In <i>Iggeret HaShmad</i>, the Rambam also discusses this question, albeit in connection with more extreme circumstances, addressing himself to people who live in countries whose governments do not allow them to follow Torah and mitzvot:<br>The advice which I give myself... my friends, and all those who seek counsel from me is to leave those places and go to a place where he can establish his faith and follow the Torah without interference or fear...He should try to do this even if it involves danger... It has already been expressed by the prophets that whoever dwells among the nonbelievers becomes like them as implied by the statements of King David of blessed memory (I Samuel 26:19 : \"You have driven me away from dwelling in the heritage of God, telling me, 'Go serve other gods;' i.e., [King David] equated his living among the gentiles with idol worship.<br>", "as [Jeremiah 9:1] states: \"Who will give me a lodging place for wayfarers, in the desert.\" - The conclusion of this verse: \"I will leave my people and go from them for they are all adulterers, a faithless band,\" demonstrates that the Rambam was not merely borrowing Biblical phraseology, but rather, quoting a verse that addresses itself specifically to the problem of living within a corrupt society.<br>"], "Human Dispositions 6.2": ["It is a positive commandment - <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 6) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 434) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>In Halachah 1, the Rambam described the association with the wise as a moral imperative and, here, he states that it is a Torah commandment. We saw a similar pattern in Chapter 1. First, he outlined his theory of the middle path of behavior as the optimal moral position. Only afterwards, did he equate it with the commandment to \"walk in His ways.\"<br>This approach demonstrates that the Torah does not impose a Divine Will upon man which he cannot grasp or understand. Rather, it reflects rules and principles that can be conceived by human thought and explained in terms of human nature. Thus, the workings of the Halachah can be seen as having been instituted as an organic part of the makeup of the world at large and man in particular.

Since the Sages fulfill the command \"Know God in all your ways\" (See Chapter 3, Halachah 3), they are in constant connection with Him. Hence, a person can also establish a bond with his Creator by \"clinging\" to them.

Therefore, though <i>Ketubot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the source for these statements, also mentions \"granting a Sage benefit from one's possessions,\" the Rambam omits this clause. Nevertheless, he does allow one to do business on behalf of a Sage as described above.

Therefore, certain commentaries have stated that the mitzvah merely requires us to perform deeds which would normally be motivated by feelings of love. However, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>Shoresh</i> 9), the Rambam specifically states that this mitzvah involves our emotions. Therefore, it must be interpreted to mean that we are commanded to bring ourselves to a state of mind that will inspire feelings of love.<br>Though the mitzvah involves our feelings, it also requires a specific course of behavior as the Rambam continues:<br>Therefore, - i.e., the following are the applications of this mitzvah in the ethical realm. However, since \"'Love your neighbor as yourself' is a great general principle in the Torah\" (<i>Sifra</i>, Leviticus 19:18 , there are also applications of this principle in many other spheres.<br>Thus, <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 14:1 states:<br>It is a positive mitzvah ordained by the Rabbis to visit the sick, comfort mourners, participate in a funeral or a wedding, accompany guests, arrange for all the needs of burial..., and to bring joy to a bride and a groom and assist them with all their needs.These are deeds of kindness performed with one's person for which there is no measure.Although these are Rabbinic commands, they are included in [the commandment, \"Love your neighbor as yourself,\" [which implies that] all the things that you would like others to do for you, you should do for your brother in Torah and mitzvot.<br>The Rambam also mentions this commandment in connection with choosing a bride (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:19), ransoming captives (<i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 8:10), and even determining the proper manner of execution (<i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 15:1).<br>", "one should speak the praises of [others] and show concern for their money just as he is concerned with his own money - <i>Avot</i> 2:15 states: \"Your friend's money should be as dear to your as your own.\"<br>", "and seeks his own honor. - This corresponds to speaking praise of others.

He wrote to a convert named Ovadiah, that although the Jews trace their lineage to Abraham, the converts' connection to Judaism is dependent on God, Himself and is, therefore, more praiseworthy.

Nevertheless, Avshalom is criticized for not making his ill feelings known and failing to try to resolve his differences with Amnon peacefully.<br>The choice of this example appears to be the Rambam's own for the commentaries have not cited any sources which he quotes. Perhaps the Rambam cites this instance to demonstrate the negative effects of such hatred. Ultimately, Avshalom slew Amnon, triggering a series of unfortunate events which culminated in a bitter civil war and his own death.<br>Rather, he is commanded - <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 205) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 239) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.

You must surely admonish your neighbor and not bear a sin because of him. (18) Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against the children of your people. Love your neighbor as yourself.<br>Each of the clauses in these two verses is halachically significant. The first verse informs us that hatred of a fellow Jew is prohibited (Halachah 5). Then, it explains how one should respond if negative feelings towards a colleague arise (Halachah 6, here). Afterwards, it teaches that one's negative feelings must be expressed in a manner that does not embarrass one's fellow Jew (Halachah 8). Thus, the verse can be rendered: Do not bear hate in your heart, instead, inform your fellow Jew of your complaint, but do so in a manner that is not sinful. (Note the Ramban's commentary on the verse.)<br>The second verse teaches that vengeance or bearing a grudge is forbidden (Chapter 7, Halachot 7-8) and then, concludes with a positive statement obligating us to love our fellow Jew (Halachah 3).<br>", "If, afterwards, [the person who committed the wrong] asks [his colleague] to forgive him, he must do so. - See <i>Yoma</i> 87a which gives several examples of Sages who went out of their way to create circumstances that would allow a person who had wronged them to ask for forgiveness.<br>", "A person should not be cruel when forgiving [as implied by Genesis 20:17]: \"And Abraham prayed to God...\" - The narrative in Genesis describes how after God punished Avimelech, King of the Philistines, for taking Sarah, he returned her to Abraham and Abraham prayed for Avimelech's recovery. Though Abraham had been wronged, he was willing to forgive Avimelech.<br>Note <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 2:10 which states:<br>It is forbidden for a person to be cruel and refuse to be appeased. Instead, he should be easily pacified and difficult to anger. When the person who wronged him asks for forgiveness, he should forgive him with a full heart...This is the path of the seed of Israel...

However, it is possible that the Rambam desired the term to be interpreted more narrowly. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 156:7 states that one is obligated to admonish only a close friend. There is no requirement to admonish a person with whom one does not share such ties when there is little likelihood that one's words will have any effect.<br>", "has sinned or is following an improper path - The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that the expression \"improper path\" refers to incorrect behavior even if no actual violation of Torah law is involved.

By sinning, a person causes real loss to himself and the entire world.<br>", "by his evil deeds as [Leviticus 19:17] states: \"You shall surely admonish your colleague.\" - The Torah mentions the mitzvah of admonishment directly after the prohibition against hating a fellow Jew, implying that admonishing is intended as a safeguard to prevent hatred from arising between Jews.<br>The previous halachah dealt with this concept in terms of our interpersonal relationships. Our halachah deals with this concept within the context of a person's relationship with God. <i>Pesachim</i> 113a teaches we must hate a sinner. As a preventive measure, the Torah offers us an alternative, admonishing him, which hopefully will cause him to correct his behavior and thus, do away with the need for such hatred (<i>Sefer Yeraim</i>).<br>A person who rebukes a colleague - whether because of a [wrong committed] against him - as mentioned in the previous halachach<br>", "or because of a matter between his colleague and God - a sin or improper course of behavior as mentioned above<br>", "should rebuke him privately. - to prevent the person being rebuked from becoming embarrassed.

The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 608:2) accepts this view as halachah. Nevertheless, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam specifically writes: \"even if one is cursed or belittled, he should not slacken or cease admonishing until he hits him.\"<br>The Ramah also mentions that the obligation to rebuke a colleague an unlimited number of times only applies when the rebuke is being given to a single individual.

It is better to allow them to remain unaware [of this transgression than risk] their willful violation of it.The same applies concerning similar cases.<br>Commenting on this law, the Ramah (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that a person should not rebuke a colleague for the inadvertent transgression of a Torah law if he knows that the transgressor will not listen.

In this case, even the person's suffering and death does not bring about atonement.

He placed his own money above and below theirs so that he would suffer any possible loss and not they. Similarly, many leniencies and provisions have been instituted within Torah law to protect the interests of orphans. For example, a person who collects a debt from an estate left to orphans must take an oath that the debt had not been repaid even though, had the debtor remained alive, the oath would not have been required.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i>, Chapter 11.<br>", "Anyone who vexes or angers them, hurts their feelings, oppresses them, or causes them financial loss transgresses this prohibition. - The violation of the prohibition is thus dependent on the feelings of the widow or orphans in question. There is no objective standard of behavior. Rather, one must become sensitive to the feelings of the people who have suffered the loss and conduct himself accordingly.<br>", "Surely this applies if one beats them or curses them. - Beating and cursing also involve the transgression of other prohibitions.

Why does he not receive lashes in such an instance?<br>The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> states that since the nature of the prohibition is very subjective, the Torah does not specify any punishment. The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> quotes an opinion which maintains that any prohibition that can be violated by speech or thought alone (as is possible in this case) is not liable for lashes even when it is transgressed with a deed. The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that the reason one does not receive lashes is stated by the Rambam himself, namely:<br>", "the retribution one suffers for its [violation] is explicitly stated in the Torah (<i>ibid.</i> 22:23): \"I will display My anger and slay you with the sword.\" - and this punishment is more severe than lashes. Hence, the lesser punishment is not administered.<br>", "There is a covenant between them and He who spoke and created the world - When people lose a loved one, they often despair and feel that the world is run in a random and arbitrary manner.

However, though the concept the Rambam mentions is also alluded to in <i>Bava Kama</i> 93a, the exact expression he uses is not mentioned there.<br>This instance supports an opinion frequently expressed by certain commentaries, i.e., that the Rambam had at his disposal midrashic sources which are not available to us. Alternatively, we are forced to say the Rambam takes the liberty of developing Halachic interpretations of Biblical verses on his own. Scholars of the post-Talmudic period would rarely make such interpretations.<br>When does the above apply? When one causes them suffering for one's own purposes. However, it is permitted for a teacher to cause them suffering while teaching them Torah, or a craft, or in order to train them in proper behavior. - This point is mentioned explicitly in the <i>Mechilta</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The <i>Mechilta</i> which is most commonly quoted is that composed by Rabbi Yishmael.

Therefore, he suggests that the Rambam actually cited part of Proverbs 23:11 which states: \"Do not enter orphans' fields for their redeemer is powerful, He will take up their cause\" and a printing error caused the other verse to be substituted.<br>Rav Kapach notes that manuscript copies of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> do not include the word \u05e9\u05e0\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 - \"as it states.\" Accordingly, he maintains that the Rambam was merely borrowing the phrasing of a verse (as is his frequent custom), but not quoting it as a prooftext.<br>", "This applies to both those orphaned from their father and those orphaned from their mother. - This point is also mentioned explicitly in the <i>Mechilta</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.

Here, he states that even a snack is forbidden.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) quotes the Rambam's view. The Ramah brings a third opinion (of the <i>Ba'al HaMa'or</i>) which rules that even a large meal is permissible before <i>Minchah Gedolah</i>, and that a snack is permissible even before <i>Minchah K'tanah</i>. He adds that perhaps the reason for this leniency is that since it was customary to call people to synagogue, it is unlikely that they would not forget to go. However, he advises following the more stringent view when praying alone.<br>", "If he begins one of these things - Even if he began after the time of <i>Minchah Gedolah</i> and, therefore, his beginning was a transgression (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).<br>", "he need not stop, but may finish and then recite <i>Minchah</i> - This leniency is also based on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>). After listing all the activities that are forbidden once <i>Minchah Gedolah</i> arrives, the Mishnah concludes: \"And if he starts, he need not stop.\"<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this is the case only if he will be able to recite <i>Minchah</i> before the conclusion of the appropriate time. To emphasize this point, the Rambam mentions explicitly: \"and then recite <i>Minchah</i>\" - i.e., after he finishes doing whatever it is that he has started doing. However, if there will not be time to pray afterwards, he must stop and pray. Only then may he resume his activity.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 232:2, follows this interpretation of the Rambam and adds that if there will not be time afterwards, one must stop what he is doing immediately. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> points out that this means that even if it is still relatively early, if one is eating and expects the meal to continue until after the time of <i>Minchah</i>, he must stop immediately and pray, rather than wait until sometime later before the end of the day.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.6": ["When is the beginning of a haircut? - In Halachah 5, the Rambam taught us that if one had already begun his involvement in any of these activities, he need not stop in order to recite <i>Minchah</i>.

(<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam states that one who has put the cloth over his knees \"is prepared for a haircut.\" From that point on, even though no hair has actually been cut, he is considered involved in the haircut, so that he need not stop to pray.<br>", "When is the beginning of a bath? - i.e., when is he considered to be bathing, so that he need not stop to pray?<br>", "When he takes off his underclothes - literally, \"the garments next to his skin.\" This is based on the Rambam's interpetation of <i>Shabbat</i> 9b: \"When he removes his \u05de\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8\u05ea\u05d5 from himself.\" Rashi, in his commentary on that passage, offers a different interpretation - one's outermost garment, i.e., the first garment removed. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) rules in line with Rashi's position.<br>", "When is the beginning of [work in the] tanning house? When he ties the apron between his shoulders, as is the way of artisans. - <i>Shabbat</i> 9b states simply: \"When he ties between his shoulders.\" In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that it is when he ties his belt in order to work with the skins. Evidently this means the belt around his apron. There is a version of the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah which mentions also that he begins working with the skins. This is, however, hard to understand in light of his commentary here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.<br>", "When is the beginning of eating? For those who live in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is when one washes one's hands - <i>Shabbat</i> 9b records a disagreement between Rav and Rabbi Chanina. Rav states that washing one's hands constitutes the beginning of eating, whereas Rabbi Chanina is of the opinion that loosening one's belt before eating is the beginning of the meal. The Talmud concludes that there is no real argument. Rav described the halachah for inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and Rabbi Chanina, for those of Babylonia.<br>", "For the inhabitants of Babylonia, it is when they loosen their belts - Rashi explains that the custom in Babylonia was to wear their belts particularly tight, necessitating that they be loosened prior to eating. This was not the case in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>It is interesting to note that in his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions only the halachah of washing one's hands. Since the Mishnah was written in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, its interpretation must be in line with the customs and realities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. However, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam focuses on the actual halachah. Hence, he defines the beginning of eating in line with both positions, one relevant to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the other to Babylonia.<br>", "When is the beginning of judgment? When the judges robe themselves in their talleisim and sit down. - Rashi explains that the judges wore their <i>talleisim</i> in court in order to focus their attention on the serious nature of the matter at hand. <i>Shabbat</i> 10a states: \"Any judge who adjudicates a judgment of absolute truth ..., is considered by the Torah to be a partner with God in the creation of the world.\"<br>", "If they were [already] sitting, it is when the adversaries begin to make their claims - <i>Shabbat</i> 10a makes this point of clarification.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.7": ["Even though the Evening Prayer is not obligatory - See Chapter 1, Halachah 6 and the commentary there.<br>", "one should not come home from his work and say: \"I will eat a little and sleep a little and then I will pray,\" lest sleep overtake him and he sleep all night. Rather, he should [first] pray, and afterwards, he may eat, drink or sleep. - <i>Berachot</i> 4b discusses the decree of the Sages requiring the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> before midnight even though its actual time lasts until dawn (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:9.). That passage states:<br>The Sages produced a support for their words in order that a person not come in from the field in the evening and say: \"I shall go home, eat a little, sleep a little and then recite the <i>Shema</i> and pray,\" lest he be overcome by sleep and sleep all night.Rather, he should come from the field in the evening and enter the synagogue. If he is accustomed to recite the <i>Shema</i> immediately, he should. If he is accustomed to study Torah first, he should study, recite the <i>Shema</i>, pray and then eat his bread and recite grace.<br>In contrast to the restrictions mentioned in the previous halachah in regard to the afternoon prayers...<br>It is permissible to have a haircut or enter a bathhouse before the Morning Prayer. [The Sages] only established their decree before <i>Minchah</i>, since it is common for most people to go there during the day. However, in the morning, [these actions] are uncommon. Hence they did not establish a decree. - Since the Mishnah cited above mentions only \"close to <i>Minchah</i>,\" the Rambam assumes that the halachot apply only to \u05de\u05e0\u05d7\u05d4 and not to \u05e9\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea for the reason he explains.<br>The Rambam does not mention going to the tanning house or eating in this halachah, because they are included in Halachah 4 regarding working or eating before the Morning Prayer, both of which are prohibited.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.8": ["A person who is involved in the study of Torah when the time for prayer arrives must stop and pray - The Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) states that one must stop for <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but not for prayer. The Talmud (11a) explains that this refers to one involved in the study of Torah.<br>", "If the study of Torah is his full-time occupation and he does not work at all, - <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) continues:<br>This applies only to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues, whose full time occupation was the study of Torah, but we stop studying to recite the <i>Shema</i> and to pray.<br>Rashi explains that anyone who interrupts his studies in order to work, must also interrupt his studies in order to pray.<br>", "and he is involved in the study of Torah at the time of prayer, he need not stop, since the commandment of the study of Torah is greater than the commandment of prayer - In <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:3, the Rambam states: \"There is no commandment among all the commandments that is equal to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah is equal to all the other commandments, since study brings one to action. Therefore, study comes before action at all times.\"<br>A person involved in Torah study achieves a level of unity with God that is unparalleled by any other activity. One's intellect and God's wisdom become inextricably linked, until they are indistinguishable during the moments of one's actual involvement in study. On this basis, we can understand the description of Torah with the metaphor of bread (Proverbs 9:5, <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13). After bread is consumed by a person, it becomes assimilated into his blood and becomes part of the person himself. Similarly, when Torah is studied, it becomes absorbed into the person's character and becomes an integral part of his being (<i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 5).<br>As explained in the introduction to this text, prayer focuses on our attempt to relate to the Godliness that permeates our worldly existence. Though this is an extremely significant service, the connection established through Torah study is more complete. Thus, <i>Shabbat</i> 10a records how Ravvah rebuked Rav Hamnuna for neglecting his Torah studies to prolong his prayers. By doing he was \"abandoning eternal life for transcient life.\" Therefore, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues whose commitment to Torah was all encompassing were not required to interrupt their studies for prayer.<br>", "Anyone involved in efforts for the welfare of the community is like one involved in Torah study - i.e., he can be compared to one whose full time occupation is the study of Torah. Therefore, he is exempt from the <i>Amidah</i> at that time.<br>This comparison of community work to the study of Torah is found in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1. However, there it is taught in the context of praying in the midst of words of Torah. (See Chapter 4, Halachah 18.) Community work is also considered like Torah, so that one may pray after such work and it is considered as if he prayed in the midst of words of Torah.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this law from the continuation of the Talmudic passage (<i>Shabbat</i> 11a) cited above. The Talmud states that one involved in the decision of whether or not to proclaim a leap year (\u05e2\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4) need not stop to pray, even though Torah study is not his full-time occupation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> posits that the Rambam views involvement in \u05e2\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 as community work. On this basis, he concludes that one need not stop in order to pray if he is involved in such activities.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.9": ["One is forbidden to interrupt his Amidah except in a situation where his life is endangered - In <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:15-17, we discussed the various situations in which one is allowed to interrupt his recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. Here, the Rambam teaches that the laws regarding the <i>Amidah</i> are much more strict. Only a threat to one's very life is considered sufficient cause to interrupt the <i>Amidah</i>.<br>", "Even if the King of Israel greets him, he must not answer him - The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 29b) states: \"Even if the king greets him, he may not answer.\" The Talmud explains that this applies only to a Jewish king, but not to a foreign king. A Jewish king is expected to appreciate the seriousness of prayer and realize that a person's unwillingness to interrupt his prayers is not intended as an insult to the king's authority, but rather, submission to an even greater authority.<br>It is interesting to note that this halachah is taught in the Mishnah within the context of halachot stressing the serious nature of the <i>Amidah</i> and the high level of concentration necessary. Just as we learned that the level of intention necessary for the <i>Amidah</i> is greater than that necessary for <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (see Chapter 5, Halachah 8 and the commentary there), so too, the halachot regarding interruptions are stricter, as mentioned.<br>", "However, he may interrupt [and answer] a non-Jewish king, lest he - fail to understand the concept explained above and...<br>", "kill him - as a rebel against the king.<br><i>Berachot</i> 32b-33a relates the following story which shows that the Sages did not always avail themselves of the leniency granted:<br>A righteous man was once praying on the road. A minister approached him and greet him. However, he did not respond.[The minister] waited until he had finished praying and said to him: \"Empty one! Is it not written in your Torah: 'Take heed and watch yourself carefully' (Deuteronomy 4:9 , and 'Guard yourselves very carefully' (Deuteronomy 4:15 .\"\"When I greeted you, why didn't you answer? If I had cut off your head with my sword, who would have sought vengeance for your life?\"He said to him: \"Let me appease you with words. If you were standing in front of an earthly king and your friend came and greeted you would you answer him?\"[The minister] said: \"No.\"\"And if you did answer him what would they do to you?\"He replied: \"They would cut off my head!\"He said: \"And is it not reasonable that if you [would not interrupt] while standing in front of an earthly king who is here today and in the grave tomorrow, so too I, standing in front of the King of Kings, the Holy One blessed be He, who is eternally present, all the more so [should I not interrupt in order to return greetings].\"The minister was appeased immediately, and the righteous person returned home in peace.\"<br>", "A person standing in the [midst of the] Amidah who sees a non-Jewish king or tyrant approaching him should shorten [his prayer]. - Rabbenu Yonah explains that this means simply to recite the beginning and end of each blessing. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also agrees with this explanation.<br>In Chapter 2, Halachot 2-3, the Rambam mentions the text for a shortened prayer. However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between this opinion and that law.<br>", "If unable to do so, he may stop. - <i>Berachot</i> 32b offers these two alternatives.<br>Rabbenu Yonah maintains that if possible, one should move slightly in order to avoid confronting the king or tyrant, and thus avoid the need to talk.<br>", "Similarly, if one sees snakes or scorpions approaching him in a place where their bite is fatal, he should stop [praying] and flee. If they are not fatal, he should not stop. - The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 29b) states: \"...and even if there is a snake curled around his ankle, he should not interrupt [his <i>Amidah</i>].\" The Talmud (33a) mentions that a snake does not cause an interruption, but a scorpion does. Rashi explains that though snakes are not likely to bite, scorpions are likely to sting. Thus, the passage raises questions on the Rambam's decision, for he does not distinguish between snakes and scorpions.<br>The Rambam's statements appear to be based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1, which states that one ignores a snake only if it is simply curling around his leg. However, were the snake to approach him in a menacing fashion, appearing likely to bite, he may flee from the snake.<br>It is important to note that there is no actual need to interrupt his <i>Amidah</i> in the case of the dangerous creatures. He need simply leave that spot, find a safe place and continue praying.<br><i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> points out that in all the cases mentioned, even if he did actually speak in the middle of <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he need only start again at the beginning of the blessing in which he stopped. If, however, he interrupted himself during the first or last three blessings, he should return to the beginning of the beginning of the first of the three blessings.<br>The laws mentioned in this halachah are discussed in the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 104.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.10": ["Women, slaves and children are obligated to pray - This is based on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 20a-b). This halachah is discussed in Chapter 1, Halachah 2.<br>", "Anyone exempt from Kri'at Shema is also exempt from the Amidah. - The laws regarding those exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> are contained in <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 4:3-6. The exemption of these people from the <i>Amidah</i> is stated explicitly in the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 17b).<br>", "All those accompanying the dead [for burial], even if they are not required to carry the coffin, are exempt from the Amidah - This is also based on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 17b) which teaches that though there are differences between the obligations people have regarding the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 4:4.), \"both are exempt from the <i>Amidah</i>.\"<br>Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> explain that the distinction between <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and the <i>Amidah</i> is based on the fact that the recital of the <i>Shema</i> is a Torah obligation. Some commentaries explain that this explanation would even be acceptable according to the Rambam. Though he holds that the <i>Amidah</i> is also a Torah obligation (see Chapter 1, Halachah 1), it is only necessary to pray once daily in order to fulfill one's Torah obligation. Therefore, one may be more lenient in granting an exemption from the <i>Amidah</i>, since the Torah obligation may have already been fulfilled or may be fulfilled by another <i>Amidah</i> later in the day.<br>However, the Rambam, himself, offers a different explanation in his commentary on the Mishnah. There, he states that since one is troubled (\u05dc\u05d1\u05d5 \u05d8\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3) by the burial, he is exempt from the <i>Amidah</i>. This seems to be a function of the greater need for intention in the <i>Amidah</i> rather than its non-Torah status.<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.1": ["Where are the head <i>tefillin</i> placed? - Though all four Biblical passages state that the <i>tefillin</i> should be worn \"between your eyes,\" <i>Menachot</i> 37b establishes a correlation between these verses and Deuteronomy 14:1, \"Do not place a bald spot between your eyes,\" and explains that, just as in the latter verse, \"between your eyes\" refers to the skull, so, too, the verses which concern <i>tefillin</i> imply a place on the skull.<br>", "They should be placed at the point of the skull, the end of the hairline towards the face - The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 27) states that the place for the head <i>tefillin</i> is the point of the skull, \"the end of the hairline towards the face until the place where a child's brain [can be felt] to pulsate.\" In his commentary on the <i>Tur</i>, Rav Yosef Karo notes the difference in phraseology between the <i>Tur</i> and the Rambam, and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 27:9), he quotes the <i>Tur's</i> text.<br>", "the place where a child's brain [can be felt] to pulsate. - Our translation is based on the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. Instead of \"pulsate,\" Rashi (<i>Menachot</i> 37a) interprets \u05e8\u05d5\u05e4\u05e1 as \"is soft.\"<br>", "Care must be taken to position them in the center - of the head,<br>", "so that they will be - parallel to the place<br>", "\"between the eyes.\" - However, to place the <i>tefillin</i> actually between one's eyes is forbidden and is considered as heresy (Halachah 3; <i>Megillah</i> 4:7).<br>", "The knot - mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 13<br>", "should be at the top portion of the neck - <i>Menachot</i> 35b states that lifting the knot to the top portion of the neck will cause \"Israel to be above and not below.\"<br>", "the bottom of the skull. - the portion opposite the face. Care should be taken that the knot be positioned in the center of the neck and not move from side to side (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 27:10). This point is directly opposite the space between the eyes.<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.2": ["The arm [<i>tefillin</i>] should be tied to one's left arm -<i>Menachot</i> 37a brings a number of exegetical references which indicate that <i>tefillin</i> should be placed on the left arm. Among them, \"It is written, 'And you shall tie' and 'And you should write.' Just as writing is done with the right hand, so, too, tying should be done with the right hand.\" Tying <i>tefillin</i> with one's right hand implies that they are placed on the left.<br>", "at the muscle - but not above the muscle (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 27:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 27:4)<br>", "i.e., the bulging flesh of the arm between the shoulder and the elbow. - <i>Menachot</i> 37b explains that though the verse literally states that <i>tefillin</i> should be placed on the hand, the exegesis of several verses indicates that they are placed on the muscle. The interpretation of the verse, \"And these words...\" quoted by the Rambam is one of the proofs cited there.<br>", "Thus, if one presses his arm to his ribs, the <i>tefillah</i> will be opposite his heart - The <i>tefillin</i>, and, in particular, the <i>yud</i> of the knot, should be tilted to face the heart (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 27:1,2).<br>", "thus, fulfilling the directive [Deuteronomy 6:6], \"And these words... shall be upon your heart.\" - This position implies that one should subjugate the desires and feelings of his heart to God (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 25:5).<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.3": ["A person who places the arm <i>tefillah</i> on his palm - in contrast to our Sages' definition of the phrase, \"on your hand\"<br>", "or the head <i>tefillah</i> on his forehead - in contrast to our Sages' definition of the phrase, \"between your eyes\"<br>", "follows the way of the Sadducees. - In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 1:3, the Rambam writes that Tzadok and Baithos were students of Antigonus of Socho. When they heard their teacher declare, \"Do not serve the master for the sake of receiving a reward,\" they were upset, since they thought that he was implying that no reward would be given for the performance of mitzvot. They spoke about the matter between themselves and decided to reject the Torah.<br>They began splinter groups which rejected the core of Jewish practice, and coveted material wealth. They found that they could not convince the majority of the people to reject the Torah entirely, so they adopted a different tactic. They claimed that they were true to Torah, but the only Torah that was Divine was the Written Law. The Oral Law was merely a human invention.<br>This thesis was only a ruse to sway the people from the performance of the mitzvot. Accordingly, the Sages would frequently refer to all those who deny the Torah and its tradition to be Sadducees (\"followers of Tzadok\") or Baithosees (\"followers of Baithos\").<br>", "A person who makes his <i>tefillin</i> rounded like a nut - <i>Megillah</i> 24b, the source for this law, adds, \"they are dangerous,\" for they can fracture the person's skull.

For a left-handed person, this is the right hand.<br>", "If he is ambidextrous, he should place them on his left hand - i.e., his left hand in a literal sense. - Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 27:6), who explains that everything depends on the hand with which the person writes. If he writes with his left hand, the <i>tefillin</i> should be placed on the right.<br>Rav Shlomo Kluger, the <i>Tzemach Tzedek</i>, and other later authorities have dealt with questions concerning people who are ambidextrous to varying degrees. Frequently, they have advised that such a person wear <i>tefillin</i> on one of his arms during the prayer service, and afterwards place them on the other arm, to make sure that he fulfills the mitzvah.<br>", "The places where to tie and place - The arm <i>tefillah</i> is \"tied,\" while the head <i>tefillah</i> is \"placed.\" This reflects the commandment in Deuteronomy 6:8, \"And you shall tie them... on your hand and they shall be... between your eyes.\" We must actually tie the arm <i>tefillin</i> upon our bodies. In contrast, the mitzvah of the head <i>tefillin</i> is that \"it be\" - i.e., be positioned in its appropriate place.<br>", "the <i>tefillin</i> were received as part of the oral tradition. - In his Introduction to the Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that, on Mount Sinai, Moses was given instructions how to observe all the mitzvot. This constituted the \"oral tradition.\" Though the Sages of the Talmud may have used certain verses from the Torah as allusions to these instructions, the fulfillment of the mitzvot began at Sinai (or shortly afterwards, depending on the mitzvah). The people did not need the allusions from the Torah to tell them how to fulfill the mitzvot, since they had already received this information orally from Moses.<br>To relate these concepts to the present context: Although the Sages mentioned several exegetical references to the places where <i>tefillin</i> are worn, it is not that the Sages discovered the proper position for <i>tefillin</i>. Rather, directly after they were given the commandment to put on <i>tefillin</i>, the Jews placed them on their arms and heads. Years later, the Sages sought allusions for these practices in the Written Law.<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.4": ["The [absence of the] head <i>tefillah</i> does not preclude [wearing <i>tefillin</i>] on the arm - i.e., if a person does not have a head <i>tefillah</i> or is in a situation where it is inappropriate to wear the head <i>tefillah</i> (see Halachah 23), he should still wear the arm <i>tefillah</i><br>", "and similarly, the [absence of the] arm <i>tefillah</i> - or if a person lost the arm on which he should place <i>tefillin</i><br>", "does not preclude [wearing <i>tefillin</i>] on the head. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions a version of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 4:1) which differs with this ruling. Rav Kapach explains that he is referring to the initial version of the Commentary on the Mishnah, which the Rambam later revised.<br>In that initial version, the Rambam explains (based on <i>Menachot</i> 44a) that the Sages feared that if a person were given license to wear only one <i>tefillah</i>, he might hesitate from purchasing the other one. Therefore, they allowed one to wear a single <i>tefillah</i> only when he already possessed the second one. When the Rambam reviewed that commentary, he emended the text to concur with the decision here.<br>", "They are two mitzvot, each one to be considered independently. - Since there are two different commandments in the Torah, \"And you shall tie... and they shall be...,\" they are regarded to be two separate mitzvot.<br>", "What blessings are recited?

When one puts on only one of them. - As mentioned in the previous halachah, at times one can put one on without the other. On such occasions, the appropriate blessing should be recited for each <i>tefillah</i>.<br>", "If, however, one puts them both on - one after the other without interruption. (The rulings governing an interruption are discussed in the following halachah.)<br>", "one recites only a single blessing, \"...to put on <i>tefillin</i>.\" - This phrase can also refer to putting on the head <i>tefillin</i>, since both mitzvot share the same intent. Hence, if no interruption is made between the two, it is unnecessary - and therefore, we are forbidden - to recite a second blessing.<br>This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:5) and is followed by all Sephardic authorities and some Ashkenazic authorities. The majority of the Ashkenazic community follows the opinion of Rabbenu Asher (quoted by the Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) which maintains that the two blessings should be recited even when no interruption is made between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>.<br>This opinion agrees that the blessing \"...to put on <i>tefillin</i>\" also applies to the head <i>tefillin</i>. Therefore, even according to this opinion, it is forbidden to make an interruption between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>; nevertheless, the Sages instituted a second blessing in recognition of the unique importance and holiness of the head <i>tefillin</i>.<br>The later authorities have added that because of the possibility that the second blessing is being recited in vain, one should recite the phrase <i>Baruch shem kavod malchuto le'olam va'ed</i>.<br>", "One should tie the <i>tefillin</i> on one's arm - Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:11) write that one should put on the head <i>tefillin</i> directly after tying the <i>tefillin</i> to the arm, before continuing to wind the straps around the hand. Thus, no interruption at all will be made between the fulfillment of the two mitzvot.<br>There are, however, certain opinions (see the commentary of Rav David Arameah) that maintain that since tying the arm <i>tefillin</i> around the middle finger is an essential element of the mitzvah, this should be done before putting on the head <i>tefillin</i>.<br>Our present practice follows the <i>Ari zal</i> who would wind the <i>tefillin</i> straps around his forearm, put on the head <i>tefillin</i>, and then, tie the straps around his hand (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 25:24, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 25:38).<br>", "and afterwards, put on the head <i>tefillin</i> - following the order stated in the Biblical commandment (<i>Menachot</i> 36a).<br>", "When one removes them, the head <i>tefillin</i> should be removed, and then the arm <i>tefillin</i>. - <i>Menachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) continues, explaining that the phrase, \"they shall be <i>totafot</i> (plural) between your eyes,\" teaches us that \"as long as the <i>tefillin</i> are 'between your eyes,' 'they should be' - i.e., one should wear both <i>tefillin</i>. Thus, the head <i>tefillah</i> should be removed before the arm <i>tefillah</i>.<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.6": ["[After] reciting the blessing, \"...to put on <i>tefillin</i>,\" and tying the <i>tefillin</i> on one's arm, one is forbidden to talk - for doing so would constitute an interruption between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>. Other interruptions - e.g., to signal to a colleague or to wink at him - are also forbidden. They do not, however, require a second blessing.<br>", "even to respond to a greeting from one's teacher - The Rambam chooses this example because a person is required to show deference to his teacher. Accordingly, although normally one is forbidden to interrupt the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, one may do so to greet his teacher or return his greetings, according to the rules outlined in <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:15-16.<br>The comparison to a teacher is also significant from a different perspective. <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) discusses when one may interrupt one's prayers \"because of fear\" - e.g., when one encounters a gentile king. Whenever an interruption is allowed in deference to such a king, one may also respond to <i>Barchu, Kedushah,</i> or <i>Kaddish</i>, for they are expressions of deference to the King of kings (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 66).<br>From the fact that the Rambam mentions the prohibition against talking between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i> in the context of deference to one's teacher, one might assume that he would allow an interruption in the above situations when deference to God is involved. Though this opinion is accepted by many early and later authorities (Rabbenu Tam, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi), the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:10) forbids making such an interruption.<br>", "until he puts on the head <i>tefillin</i>. If he talks, it is considered to be a transgression - since, by doing so, he obligates himself to recite a second blessing that would otherwise not be required. Reciting an unnecessary blessing violates the prohibition, \"Do not take the name of God, your Lord, in vain\" (Exodus 20:7 .<br>Based on Deuteronomy 20:8, the Sages explained that the Jewish army should be composed only of righteous men. Any sinners were excused from military service. Significantly, there are opinions which consider this transgression significant enough for a person to be included in this category (<i>Sotah</i> 44b).<br>", "[In such an instance,] one is required to recite the second blessing, \"...concerning the mitzvah of <i>tefillin</i>,\" and then put on the head <i>tefillin</i>. - The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:9) requires that the person also repeat the blessing \"...to put on <i>tefillin</i>\" in this instance.

At home, or in other places where one could keep the <i>tefillin</i> in a safe place, it is forbidden to wear <i>tefillin</i> in a lavatory (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 43:5).1. See Halachah 11, which prohibits putting on <i>tefillin</i> after sunset.2. As explained in Halachah 24, a container which is always used for <i>tefillin</i> or other sacred articles is considered as an accessory to the <i>tefillin</i> with no importance of its own. Thus, it is as if the <i>tefillin</i> are being held without any covering at all. Nevertheless, if it is a handbreadth in size, it is given halachic significance as an <i>ohel</i>. Hence, it is considered to be a separation between the <i>tefillin</i> and the lavatory.<br>Needless to say, these laws apply only when the person does not have a safe place where he can deposit his <i>tefillin</i>. If such a place is available, he may not bring <i>tefillin</i> into a lavatory (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).3. See Halachah 24, which forbids engaging in intercourse in a room which contains <i>tefillin</i> that are open.4. Thus, it is feared that they may have touched the genitalia (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 26b). Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 40:7), who prohibits a person from wearing <i>tefillin</i> if he has any traces of semen on his body. 5. This halachah is dependent on the description of a bathhouse in<i>Shabbat</i> 10a. There were three rooms: a waiting room, a dressing room, and the actual bathing room.6. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 45:3 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 45:5 explain that this applies even when no one there is actually naked. Those sources also state that these laws apply only in bathhouses which contain filth. In contrast, there are no restrictions against wearing <i>tefillin</i> in the bathing room of a mikveh if no people are standing there naked. Compare also to <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:3-4, 16.<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.23": ["A person should not walk in a cemetery - even if he is not within four cubits of a grave (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 45:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 45:1)<br>", "wearing his head <i>tefillin</i>. - Arm <i>tefillin</i>, however, need not be removed, for they can be worn under one's sleeve.

One must be careful, however, to cover the straps of the arm <i>tefillin</i>, even those around one's hand and finger (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 45:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 45:3).<br>", "Even [outside a cemetery], a person should remove his - head<br>", "<i>tefillin</i> if he comes within four cubits of a corpse or a grave - Proverbs 17:5 states: \"One who mocks the poor (\u05e8\u05e9) reproaches his Creator.\" <i>Berachot</i> 18a explains that the word \u05e8\u05e9 can also refer to the dead, and states that performing mitzvot in the presence of a corpse or by his graveside would be, in a certain sense, mocking him, since he is unable to perform mitzvot. Accordingly, the Sages forbade Torah study, the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, and the performance of other mitzvot in these situations.<br>", "until he distances himself four cubits from them. - Beyond this distance, one is not considered to be in the actual presence of the corpse. If a cemetery is surrounded by a wall, one may wear <i>tefillin</i> outside the wall even within four cubits of a grave, because the wall constitutes a separation (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 45:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 45:1).<br>", "A person should not put on <i>tefillin</i> [when he is naked]. He must first cover his genitalia - From the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 2:3), it appears that, in addition to wearing a cloak over one's body, one must also cover one's genitalia before putting on <i>tefillin</i>.<br>", "and put on his clothes. - <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 45:3 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 45:5 associate this prohibition with the prohibition against standing naked in the presence of sacred texts.<br>", "A person who is carrying a load on his head should remove his head <i>tefillin</i> [and not put it on again] until he puts down his load. - <i>Bava Metzia</i> 105b considers this a lack of respect for the <i>tefillin</i>.<br>", "It is even forbidden to wear a handkerchief - or any other article which is not a garment and is not usually worn on one's head (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 41:1)<br>", "around one's head when wearing <i>tefillin</i>.

Since the hat is being worn as a garment, it is not considered disrespectful to the <i>tefillin</i>. Our Sages relate that the High Priest would wear his turban over the <i>tefillin</i> (<i>Zevachim</i> 19b), and the king would wear his crown above the <i>tefillin</i> (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 44a).<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.24": ["When <i>tefillin</i> or a Torah scroll are in a room, it is forbidden to engage in sexual relations, unless they are removed or placed into a container, and that container placed into a second container - These laws also apply with regard to sacred texts (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 40:4) and mezuzot (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 40:5).<br>", "which is not specific to them. - Covering the <i>tefillin</i>'s container with another garment is sufficient.

In the later generations, this practice was generally followed only by Torah scholars, as the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> relates in the name of Rav Amram Gaon:<br>We saw the <i>Geonim</i>, the heads of the court, and the giants of the previous generations... who would not remove their <i>tefillin</i> until after... the <i>Shema</i> of the evening service.<br>Nevertheless, at present, even Torah scholars have accepted the practice of wearing <i>tefillin</i> only during the morning prayers. This practice was instituted since <i>tefillin</i> require \"a clean body\" (Halachah 15) and one cannot divert his attention from them (Halachah 14), and most people cannot meet these requirements (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 37:2).<br>", "for this is the mitzvah associated with them. - Note the questions in the <i>Pri Megadim</i> and the <i>Bi'ur Halachah</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 37): Is the mitzvah of <i>tefillin</i> to wear them all day, or is the mitzvah to put <i>tefillin</i> on once each day, with the remaining time one wears them being merely the continuation of the mitzvah.<br>", "Among the praises conveyed upon Rav, the student of Rabbenu Hakadosh - Though we find <i>Megillah</i> 28a conveying such praise on Rav Zeira, there is no passage in the Talmud which describes Rav in these terms. Nevertheless, the responsa of the <i>Geonim</i> (<i>Damasek Eliezer</i> 178) include these among the ten acts of pious behavior for which Rav was noted.<br>", "was that he was never seen walking four cubits without [reciting words of] Torah, without <i>tzitzit</i>, and without <i>tefillin</i>. - See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11, which describes such behavior as an example of <i>Kiddush Hashem</i> (the sanctification of God's name).<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.1": ["These are the required measurements of a sukkah: Its height - I.e., the height of its inner space, without including the height of the <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Eruvin</i> 3b)<br>", "should not be less than ten handbreadths - anything less is not considered to be a dwelling fit for human habitation (See <i>Sukkah</i> 4a.) <i>Sukkah</i> 4b-5a derives the concept as follows: The ark and the <i>kaporet</i> covering it were ten handbreadths high. This constituted a line of demarcation between the place where the <i>Shechinah</i> was manifest and the area below it. Thus, we see that a height of ten handbreadths is sufficient for an independent area.<br>Rabbenu Manoach establishes a closer relationship between the above concept and a sukkah, noting that Exodus 25:20 describes how the wings of the cherubs \"shall shield the <i>kaporet</i>,\" using the verb \u05e1\u05db\u05db\u05d9\u05dd, which has the same root as the word <i>s'chach</i>. The beginning of the height of the cherub's \"shield,\" ten cubits, is the minimum of the height for our <i>s'chach</i>.<br>", "nor more than twenty cubits. - Any structure more than twenty cubits high can only be built as a permanent dwelling. Hence, it is unfit to serve as a sukkah, which must be of a temporary nature.

A handbreadth is 8 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 9.6 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.<br>The Rambam explains the requirement of seven handbreadths by seven hand breadths as follows: The first three hand breadths are not of consequence because of the principle of <i>l'vud</i> and four additional handbreadths are required since the smallest area of halachic consequence is four cubits by four cubits (Commentary, to the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1).<br>If the sukkah is not seven handbreadths in either length or width, it is invalid, even if its area equals 49 square handbreadths. If it is round in shape, it must be sufficiently large to encompass a square seven by seven (See Halachah 7). This size is required because if either of the dimensions were less, it would not be considered a dwelling fit for human habitation (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 634:1-2; <i>Magen Avraham; Taz</i>).<br>", "[There is no maximum limit to] its area - The commentaries point to <i>Sukkah</i> 27b: \"All Israel is fit to sit in one sukkah,\" as the source for this statement.

Rabbi Shimeon counts \"a cover from storm and from rain\" as two different activities, and hence requires four walls.<br>", "However, if it has two complete walls - i.e., walls of at least seven handbreadths long, so that the minimum requirements for the sukkah's area mentioned in the previous halachah can be met<br>", "perpendicular to each other in the shape of [the Greek letter], gamma - Rabbenu Manoach notes that a <i>gamma</i> has the same shape as the Hebrew letter <i>dalet</i> (see accompanying drawing) and asks why the Sages did not use that letter to refer to the intended shape.

Therefore, it becomes forbidden.<br>According to the <i>Beit Yosef's</i> opinion (see <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145), which maintains that a gentile can cause a Jew's property to become forbidden, this passage teaches us that the Jew's act is considered sufficient to cause the brick to become forbidden.<br>", "Similarly, if he - a Jew<br>", "stands an egg up and a gentile comes and bows down to it, it becomes forbidden. - This situation is left as an unresolved question in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>). Rashi explains that the question is whether standing up an egg is, like standing up a brick, a significant act, or whether, because an egg is much smaller than a brick, standing it up is of no significance.

Also, the laws of a <i>ger toshav</i> apply only during the era when the Jubilee year is observed. Nevertheless, from <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 11:7 and 13:11, it appears that even a gentile who observes the seven Noachide laws cannot nullify an idol in the present era. There, the Rambam explains that the Moslems are not considered to be idolaters regarding the laws of <i>yayin nesech</i>. Thus, it can be assumed that their nullification of idol worship would not be of consequence.<br>See also the statements of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 124:2) and the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 124:5), which appear to accept this decision.<br>", "When [a gentile] nullifies a false deity, he also nullifies [the connection to idol worship of] its accessories - and it becomes permitted to benefit from them. The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:13) states that this law applies even if a Jew had already taken possession of the accessories, so long as the false deity remained in the possession of the gentile.<br>", "When he nullifies [the connection to idol worship of] its accessories, it is permitted to benefit from the accessories.

Smoothing out any other portion of the idol is not effective.<br>", "or sells it to a Jewish jeweler - By doing so, the gentile implies his willingness to have the Jew smelt down the idol to its precious metal value. Thus, he obviously no longer considers it to be a god.<br>This point is debated in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 53a, and no explicit conclusion is reached. Most other authorities (and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:8) maintain that selling it to a Jewish jeweler is insufficient to nullify it.<br>", "it is nullified. - Note the Ramah's decision (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:7) that making a verbal statement is sufficient to nullify it as an idol in most cases.

Hence, we cannot be certain that it was nullified by the seller.<br>", "[left it] after it was covered by fallen articles without removing them, did not demand its return after it was stolen by thieves - Such acts appear to indicate that the gentile has little reverence for his idol.

Resh Lakish maintains that we can assume that the gentiles nullified their worship of the idol. If it could not save itself, surely it cannot save them.<br>Rabbi Yochanan does not accept this opinion and maintains that even when an idol is broken it is revered. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 49b states that the gentiles would even worship the broken pieces of an idol. (See also the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:3.)<br>", "Accordingly, when a person finds broken pieces of an idol, [he must regard them] as forbidden, lest the gentiles have not nullified them. - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 41b explains that although the possibility exists that the idol was nullified, we must still regard it as forbidden. Since it is recognized as an idol, the prohibition against using it becomes an established fact, which cannot be changed until we are certain that it has been nullified as an object of worship. (Note also our commentary on Chapter 7, Halachah 7.)<br>", "[The following principles apply to an idol] which comes in pieces: If it could be reassembled by an ordinary person - the fact that it is broken is not of consequence. Indeed, the laws which govern it are more stringent than if it remained whole.<br>", "each piece must be nullified individually - for each is considered to be a separate entity.<br>", "If [an ordinary person] could not reassemble it, once one has nullified one of its limbs, all of them are nullified. - Since the idol is broken and cannot be reassembled by an ordinary person, it is treated more leniently, and if one part of it is nullified, the entire idol becomes permitted. In contrast to the Ra'avad and some other authorities, the Rambam does require that at least this minimal nullification be carried out.

Thus, we are forced to say that this law is speaking about an instance where the stone is presently being used as a platform. It can be interpreted as applying when the damage happens as a matter of course. The Rambam is teaching us that even though the stone is being used as a platform at present, since it will soon be replaced, it is permitted. Alternatively, it is speaking about a stone which was originally hewn out to be used as a platform. In such an instance, the damage must be purposely caused by a gentile with the intention of nullifying the platform.<br>", "What is considered a platform, and what, an altar? A platform consists of a single stone; an altar, of many stones. - Rather than differentiate between them because of the functions they serve, explaining that a platform is used to place idols upon, and an altar, to bring sacrifices, the Rambam (based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>,) considers size the determinant.<br>", "How are the stones of Marculis nullified? - As mentioned, a shrine to Marculis consists of three stones placed one on top of the other.<br>", "When one constructs a building from them or uses them to pave the roads or the like, it is permitted to benefit from them. - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 50a relates that even Rabbi Menachem b'Rabbi Simai, who was called the son of the holy because he would not look at the image of a coin, lest it carry the form of an idol, would walk on such roads.<br>", "How is an asherah - A tree which is worshiped or one which offers shade for an idol<br>", "nullified?

That day, hundreds of students streamed into the house of study, and even Rabban Gamliel felt the need to reconsider his approach.

Our Sages (see the uncensored text of <i>Sotah</i> 47a) were highly critical of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Parchiah, who \"pushed Jesus away with two hands,\" and thus caused him to forsake Judaism entirely.<br>", "Similarly, one should not study from a teacher who does not follow a proper path, even though he - the teacher<br>", "is a very wise man and his [instruction] is required by the entire nation, until he returns to a good path - <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 17a relates that there was a Torah sage whose knowledge was needed by his community.

Most people should refrain from studying under such teachers.<br>Accordingly, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> concludes that the Rambam did not quote the passage from <i>Chaggigah</i> because, at present, there are none who are of a stature great enough not to be influenced by a teacher of improper character.<br>The <i>Sefer Kovetz</i> notes that the Rambam mentions this verse in the beginning of his introduction to the Guide to the Perplexed, alluding to the fact that, in composing that work, he had to follow Rabbi Meir's example and study under teachers whose behavior he would not desire to emulate. Nevertheless, this did not represent a contradiction to his omission of this teaching in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. We find that under extraordinary conditions, it is permitted to follow a minority opinion in the Talmud. Hence, when the Rambam saw the need to compose a text like the Guide to the Perplexed, he felt that under such conditions, he should follow Rabbi Meir's example.<br>"], "Torah Study 4.2": ["so that all can see the teacher and hear his words. - <i>Keritot</i> 6a states: \"When you sit before your teacher, look at his face, as [implied by Isaiah 30:20]: 'And your eyes shall behold your teachers.54<br>", "The teacher should not sit on a chair, [while] his students [sit] on the ground.

He explains that sometimes the teacher would sit in an upraised position, so that the students could hear his words more easily. Alternatively, when a sage possessed <i>semichah</i>, the distinct Rabbinic ordination conveyed in a line from teacher to teacher, stretching back to Moses, he was granted greater privileges.<br>Originally, the teacher would sit and the students would stand. - The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> notes that this appears to be a direct contradiction to the principle of equality mentioned beforehand.

In Babylon and even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the popular spoken language was Aramaic, while many of the Sages preferred to teach in Hebrew. Therefore, they would speak to the spokesman in a hushed tone in Hebrew, and he would translate the teachings to Aramaic and teach them to the public in a loud voice.<br>Others maintain that the spokesman was no more than a \"human microphone.\" Rather than have the sage weary himself in speaking in a tone which all could hear, he would speak softly, and the spokesman would speak in a tone that all could hear. This opinion is supported by certain passages (e.g., <i>Kiddushin</i> 31b), which refer to the spokesman as <i>amoriyah</i>, which is the Aramaic for <i>metargaman</i>.<br>The Ra'avad mentions a third perspective, explaining that the spokesman also communicated the teacher's words in a manner that could be understood and grasped by the students. Rabbi Shalom Dovber of Lubavitch follows a similar, but not identical, view. In <i>Yom Tov Shel Rosh Hashanah</i> 5666, he elaborates on this concept in detail, explaining that the teacher was on too high a level to explain his ideas in a manner which the common people could understand. Therefore, he would employ a spokesman, who, though he was able to comprehend the teacher's statements, was on a level that his explanations would not be too sophisticated for the people to grasp.

Throughout these halachot, the Rambam makes no mention of whether the owner of the house previously nullified his chametz or not. This fact is extremely important, for different principles apply to an obligation required by Torah law from those that apply to one instituted by the Rabbis. Indeed, other Rabbinic authorities (some of whom are quoted in the commentaries to the various halachot) devote much attention to this issue, clarifying at length whether the laws apply:a) only when a person had already nullified (or can still nullify) his chametz, or;<br>b) even when the search for chametz is required by Torah law.Since the Rambam does not explicitly state his opinion on this matter, it is impossible to be sure which perspective he adopts. However, when the chapter is considered in its entirety, it appears that these halachot describe a situation where chametz has already been nullified.

In such instances, the fact that there is a much higher probability that the article in question was taken from the permitted substances is not considered significant, and the more stringent perspective is taken. See also <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 8:11.<br>Nevertheless, the Ra'avad and other authorities take issue with this halachah, explaining that the Talmud only made such a statement when a person has not nullified his chametz, and the responsibility to search the house stems from the Torah itself. However, if the person already nullified his chametz, the search is only a Rabbinic obligation. Hence, it should be judged more leniently.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that even though leniencies may generally be taken when doubts arise concerning Rabbinic obligations, the search for chametz is an exception. The entire obligation was instituted even when there was no definite knowledge that chametz existed. Hence, even in this case, a search must be made.<br>Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:1) accepts the Rambam's opinion, the Ramah and the other Ashkenazic authorities make the following qualification: If the person had already nullified his chametz and if the bread was small enough for the mouse to have eaten it entirely, a second search is not required.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.11": ["There were two piles: one of chametz and one of matzah, and two houses: one that had been searched and one that had not been searched.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:4) agrees to this principle, but offers an addition leniency: Even if the owner did not nullify his chametz, a second search is not required when the bread the mouse was holding is small enough to be eaten at once.<br>", "Similarly, there were two houses which had been checked, with one pile of chametz before them. A mouse took [from the pile and entered a house]. However, we do not know which house he entered... -- Each of the homes is judged individually.

Though Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel requires the entire field to be searched, Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi maintains that no further search must be made.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (ibid.) emphasizes that this leniency should only be followed when the owner of the house has nullified or can still nullify the ownership over his chametz. Otherwise, he must thoroughly search the entire house.<br>", "Similarly, when there were nine piles of matzah and one of chametz, and a loaf became separated from the piles, and we do not know whether it was chametz or matzah: If a mouse took the loaf that became separated and entered the house that had been checked -- The passage from <i>Pesachim</i> 9b concerning the ten butcher shops quoted in the commentary on the previous halachah, continues:[If meat from these shops] is found, follow the majority.The principle of \u05e7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2 - judging the permitted and forbidden substances as if they were equal - applies only when the doubt concerning the identity of the substance arises in the place where the presence of the forbidden substance has become fixed. Thus, since the meat has become separated (\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9) from its original place, this principle no longer applies and, as in most cases of mixtures, the decision depends on whether there is a greater number of kosher or non-kosher stores.<br>Similarly, in the case at hand: Since the loaf became separated from the piles before being taken by the mouse, there is no question of a prohibited substance having a fixed identity (\u05e7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e2). Hence, we follow the majority, and thus do not require a further search. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> emphasize that this leniency applies even if the owner of the house had not nullified the ownership over his chametz.<br>", "In all of these cases, there is no need to check a second time -- The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> emphasizes that this is a complete thought in its own right.<br>", "because the presence of the forbidden substance is not fixed -- According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this statement applies only to the final instance mentioned in the halachah as explained.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.12": ["In the following cases, a second search is required.<br>", "A person who placed chametz in one corner and discovered it in another -- <i>Pesachim</i> 10b explains that the Sages felt that it was likely that the chametz discovered was not the chametz lost. Rather, different chametz was placed in the other corner, and the first chametz, deposited elsewhere throughout the house. Hence, a new search is required (See also <i>Hilchot Mitamei Mishkav U'Moshav</i> 12:16.)<br>The Shulchan Aruch HaRav (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:9) states that if the same amount of chametz that was lost is found there is no need to search further if the owner had already nullified the ownership over his chametz. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> grants an even greater leniency and frees the owner of the necessity to search, without placing any qualifications on the chametz discovered, as long as he has nullified his chametz.<br>", "or who put aside nine loaves and found ten -- <i>Pesachim</i> 10a compares this to the following case: \"A person put aside 100 dinars of money designated as <i>ma'aser sheni</i> (the second tithe, to be used only to purchase food in Jerusalem) and discovered two hundred.\"<br>In <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 6:3, the Rambam declares that none of the money is considered as <i>ma'aser sheni</i>. In both instances, we suppose that the substance put aside was taken away and a new substance substituted for it. Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> emphasizes that the owner cannot cease his search until he finds nine piles of chametz. This law applies even if the owner has nullified his ownership over the original nine piles of chametz.<br>", "or a mouse came and took the chametz, and there is a doubt whether he entered this house or not -- <i>Pesachim</i> 10a likens this to a case when a person traveled through a valley in which one of the fields was known to possess a grave. Though he is unsure of whether he entered the field containing the grave or not, he must consider himself ritually impure (See <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTum'ah</i> 20:9.)<br>The Ra'avad's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> contained an additional clause:or there were nine piles of chametz and one pile of matzah: A loaf became separated from them and it is not known whether it was chametz or matzah. A mouse came and took it into a checked house.The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> rejects the inclusion of this clause because in the previous halachah, the Rambam had already stated that once a substance is separated from its original place, its identity is determined on the basis of the majority.<br>", "In all these cases, he must search [the house again].<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.13": ["A mouse entered a house with a loaf -- of chametz<br>", "in its mouth.

Second, as explained in the following halachah, there is a difference whether one performs these mitzvot by oneself or whether one performs them on behalf of another person.<br>", "one should recite the blessing \"... to affix a <i>mezuzah</i>\"; if one erects a guardrail on one's roof, one should recite the blessing \"...to erect a guardrail.\" - See Halachah 4, Note 13.<br>", "Should one separate terumah for oneself, one should recite the blessing \"... to separate [terumah].\" - The Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> also mention the separation of tithes in this context.<br>", "Should one circumcise one's own son, one should recite the blessing \"... to circumcise [one's] son.\" - Although the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 265:2) mentions the Rambam's opinion, the Ramah states that it is customary to recite the blessing \"... concerning the circumcision,\" at all times.<br>", "Should one slaughter one's Paschal sacrifice or festive sacrifice, one recites the blessing \"... to slaughter....\" - The Rambam mentions these mitzvot to contrast them with the following halachah, which describes their performance on behalf of another person. It would appear that the Rambam is making the point that one should use the form \"... to...\" when performing the mitzvah oneself even when, in general, it is more likely that the mitzvah be performed by an agent (<i>Kin\u2019at Eliyahu</i>).<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.1": ["Women, slaves, and minors are freed from [fulfilling the mitzvah of] sukkah. - The same laws that apply to hearing the <i>shofar</i> apply to Sukkah. Hence, women and slaves are free of obligation, as is the case regarding all mitzvot whose fulfillment is associated with a specific time. Minors have no obligations at all according to the Torah. (See the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 1.)<br>See also the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 2 regarding a woman's right to perform the mitzvah if she desires, and whether permission is granted for her to recite a blessing.<br>", "A tumtum and an androgynous are obligated because of the doubt [concerning their status]. - See the commentary on the above halachah for a definition of these terms and their status. Note Halachah 13 regarding their recitation of a blessing.<br>", "Similarly, a person who is half slave and half free is obligated. - See the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachot 1 and 3.<br>", "A minor who does not require his mother's [presence] - <i>Sukkah</i> 28b offers two definitions of this term:a) a child who does not need his mother to help him after he relieves himself;<br>b) a child who does not wake up in the night and call out: \"Mommy! Mommy!\"Nevertheless, based on <i>Eruvin</i> 82a, the Rambam provided us with a more definite guideline...<br>", "i.e., a child of five or six - is obligated [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah according to Rabbinic decree - According to Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 48a) and the Ramban (<i>Milchamot Hashem, Berachot</i> 20b), there is no obligation incumbent on the child himself. The child's father is obligated to educate him. If he has no father, the obligation falls on his mother and on the local Rabbinic court (<i>Terumat Hadeshen</i> 99).<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 48a) differs and explains that the Sages placed the obligation on the minor himself. From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he accepts this view.<br>Support for this premise can be derived from the Rambam's decision in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who ate a small meal can fulfill his obligation by listening to a child reciting the grace after meals (for both are obligated by virtue of Rabbinic decree). Though others object on the grounds that the child himself is not obligated in the mitzvah, the Rambam states that such a practice is acceptable.<br>", "to train him in [the performance of] mitzvot. - The Rambam mentions the same concept in <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:9, <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:1, and <i>Hilchot Lulav</i> 7:19.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.2": ["The sick and their attendants - Since the latter's performance of a mitzvah - tending to the sick - does not enable them to perform the mitzvah of dwelling in the sukkah, they are absolved from the obligation.

However, this leniency is granted only during the time the sick person requires their assistance (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 640:7).<br>", "are freed from [fulfilling the mitzvah] of sukkah. This applies not only to a person who is dangerously ill - who is free from the obligation to perform all mitzvot, even those as severe as the Sabbath or Yom Kippur;<br>", "but also to one with a headache - or any other minor illness (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:4).<br>This leniency is granted because of one of the basic principles related to the mitzvah of sukkah. Leviticus 23:42 states: \"You shall dwell in sukkot (\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e1\u05db\u05ea).\" On that verse, <i>Sukkah</i> 26a comments: \u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5 \u05db\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5 - i.e., dwelling in the sukkah is comparable to living in one's own home. Thus, a person is not required to dwell in a sukkah under circumstances which would cause him to leave his own home.<br>Since a person who is sick would seek the most comfortable lodgings possible and would not camp outside, he is not obligated to do so to fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah (Rabbenu Manoach).<br>", "or a sore eye. - <i>Sukkah</i> 26a relates that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel was granted permission to sleep outside the sukkah for this purpose.<br>The Torah's prohibitions are suspended not only when a person's life is in danger, but also when a particular limb might be lost. Though this premise is accepted by the Rambam (see <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 2:4), it does not appear that he is referring to it here. Rather, it seems that he means a minor ailment comparable to a headache. See also <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Sukkah</i>, ibid.).<br>", "A person who is uncomfortable [when dwelling in the sukkah] is freed from the obligation [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah. - based on the principle of \u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5 \u05db\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5, as explained above. Just as a person would seek out a comfortable permanent dwelling, he is obligated to dwell only in a sukkah which does not cause him unpleasantness.<br>Rabbenu Manoach states that this leniency does not apply on the first night of Sukkot, on which there is a binding obligation to eat in the sukkah. (See Halachah 6.) The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 640:4) quotes this statement as halachah.<br>", "This applies to the person himself, but not to his attendants. - Some earlier texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> stated that leniency was also granted to such a person's attendants, but that is surely a printing error (Rabbenu Manoach).<br>", "Who is \"a person who is uncomfortable [when dwelling in the sukkah]\"? A person who cannot sleep in the sukkah because of the wind or because of the flies, mites, or the like, or because of the smell. - The <i>Tur</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 640:4), and the Ramah emphasize that this law applies only when the discomfort is an unexpected occurrence. However, a sukkah which is constructed in a place where the discomfort will surely come is considered to be unfit to dwell in and is unacceptable for the performance of the mitzvah.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.3": ["A mourner - The term \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc refers to a person in the seven days of mourning which follow the burial of a father, mother, wife, brother, sister, son, or daughter. An \u05d0\u05d5\u05e0\u05df (a person in mourning for these relatives before their burial) is freed from the obligation of sukkah, because he is absolved of the duty to perform all mitzvot (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 4:6).<br>It must be noted that none of the mourning rites should be followed during a festival. If a close relative dies before the festival, the <i>shiv'ah</i> (seven days of mourning) is completed at the festival's commencement, even though all seven days have not passed (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 10:3, 8).<br>", "is obligated [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah. - <i>Sukkah</i> 25b explains that a mourner (\u05d0\u05d1\u05dc) is obligated to fulfill all the mitzvot. Nevertheless, one might suppose that just as a person who is uncomfortable is freed from the obligation of sukkah, a mourner would also be absolved. Therefore, the Talmud includes a special teaching to emphasize the mourner's obligation, explaining that one is absolved only for discomfort which comes from external factors. In this case, the mourner brings discomfort upon himself. He should compose himself and concentrate his attention on the mitzvah.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (640:13) writes that if dwelling in a sukkah will cause a mourner more discomfort than dwelling in his home, he is allowed to choose the latter alternative.<br>", "A groom - because he is involved in the mitzvah of marriage. <i>Sukkah</i> 25b adds that generally, a sukkah is to small to carry out the wedding celebrations in the proper manner. Furthermore, the groom is obligated to rejoice together with his wife, and the sukkah is not an appropriate setting.<br>", "his attendants - In <i>Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah</i>, Chapter 7, the Rambam describes the custom of \u05e9\u05d5\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea (attending a groom).<br>", "and all the members of the wedding party - They are absolved of the mitzvah only while they are involved in the mitzvah of celebrating together with the bride and groom, however, when they leave, they are obligated. Furthermore, there are many authorities who require that the meals served the groom and his attendants be served in a sukkah. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 640:33.)<br>", "are freed from [fulfilling the mitzvah] of sukkah throughout the seven days of [the wedding] festivities. - It must be emphasized that the wedding must have taken place during the four days between Yom Kippur and Sukkot.

Since, at night they are also involved with thinking about how to fulfill the mitzvah, they are still considered as occupied with the performance of a mitzvah and are not required to seek out a sukkah. An example of this principle quoted by the Talmud supports this interpretation:When Rav Chisda and Rabbah bar Rav Huna would attend [the lecture delivered] at the home of the exilarch on the Sabbath of the festival, they would sleep along the river banks of Sura.<br>They explained: \"We are emissaries involved in a mitzvah\" (<i>Sukkah</i> 26a).Though these Sages were visiting a city which served as a center of Jewish life and surely could have found a sukkah to lodge in, they did not see the necessity for doing so. (See also <i>Sukkah</i> 10b.)<br>Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 10b, interprets the passage differently and explains that leniency is granted these emissaries only when dwelling in the sukkah would in some way prevent them from carrying out the mitzvah which they set out to perform. If it is possible to do both - perform the mitzvah they set out to do and fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah - one must endeavor to do so.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam shares Rashi's view. However, the final halachic position followed by most Ashkenazic authorities is closer to <i>Tosafot</i>'s position: i.e., these emissaries are not obligated to trouble themselves to find a sukkah. However, if there is a sukkah available, they should make use of it. Nevertheless, if sleeping in the sukkah would prevent them from getting proper rest, and thus hold them back from fulfilling their mitzvah in a proper manner, they are not required to sleep in a sukkah (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 640:18; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 640:38).<br>(Abstractly, it is possible to differentiate between the two positions as follows. According to Rashi, there is no obligation of sukkah incumbent on this person whatsoever. In contrast, <i>Tosafot</i> would maintain that the person is obligated to perform the mitzvah. However, at all times he is bound by another commitment which takes precedence.)<br>", "People who journey during the day are freed from [fulfilling the mitzvah] of sukkah during the day - i.e., while they are traveling. <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 26a explains that this concept is derived from the principle: \u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5 \u05db\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5 - i.e., dwelling in the sukkah is comparable to living in one's own home.

However, if a watchman is charged with guarding produce which is collected in one place, he is capable of fulfilling the mitzvah and discharging his duty. Hence, he is obligated to construct a sukkah there.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.5": ["How must the mitzvah of dwelling in the sukkah be fulfilled?

(Accordingly, a blessing is recited whenever one makes use of the sukkah [Halachah 12]. See Halachah 7.)<br>", "both during the day and at night - <i>Sukkah</i> 43a derives this concept by drawing an analogy (\u05d2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d4) to the seven days of preparation for the dedication of the Sanctuary. Thus, just as the priests were required to stay in the Sanctuary for seven days - day and night - similarly, the mitzvah of sukkah must be observed in the same manner.<br>", "in the same manner as he dwells in his home throughout the year - following the principle of \u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5 \u05db\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05ea\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5 mentioned above.<br>", "During these seven days, he must consider his house as a temporary dwelling and the sukkah as his permanent home - This statement is a quote from the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:8. In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam defines \u05e7\u05d1\u05e2 as \"of primary importance and a constant practice.\"<br>", "as [Leviticus 23:42] states: \"You shall dwell in sukkot for seven days.\"<br>", "What does this imply? His attractive utensils and attractive bedding - [should be brought] to the sukkah.

The Rambam's intent is that after the meal there is no necessity to keep one's plates in the sukkah, because they are not attractive and are generally stored in pantries outside the home. In contrast, it is customary in many communities not to bring pots into the sukkah, even while eating (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:5). [Needless to say, plates that must be washed must be removed from the sukkah.]<br>The printed (as opposed to certain manuscripts) text of Rashi (<i>Sukkah</i> 29a) also shares the Rambam's interpretation. <i>Tosafot</i> explains the passage slightly differently, rendering \"utensils used for food\" as \"utensils used in the preparation of food\" - i.e., pots and pans.<br>", "A candelabra - i.e., the source of light<br>", "[should be brought] to the sukkah - even when it is not burning, since it is attractive.<br>", "However, if the sukkah is small, it should be left outside the sukkah. - lest it cause a fire (<i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i>, ibid.). This differs from Rashi's interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i>, ibid., which explains that the Talmud is referring to an earthenware lamp. Thus, we may assume that it should not be brought into the sukkah because it is unattractive. This, appears to justify the statements of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, who writes that the lamp should not be brought into the sukkah when it is not burning. Both opinions are quoted by the later halachic authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:3; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:7-8).<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.6": ["We should eat, drink, and sleep in the sukkah through the entire seven days [of the festival], both during the day and at night. It is forbidden to eat a meal - i.e., a meal of bread or food prepared from the five species of grain<br>", "outside the sukkah for the entire seven [day period]. - The <i>B'nei Binyamin</i> explains that this expression includes the Sabbath and festivals, thus excluding the opinions which maintain that any meal of bread eaten on the Sabbath or festivals is significant and cannot be considered as a snack. See the commentary of Rabbi Akiva Eiger.<br>", "However, [there is no prohibition] if one eats a snack - even of bread, outside the sukkah.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 26a defines \"a snack\" as \"what the students will eat before they enter the study sessions.\" In his commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:4, the Rambam explains it as \"a small amount, [eaten] without considering it as a meal, in order to satisfy one's hunger [temporarily], until one can complete eating afterwards.\"<br>Rabbenu Manoach explains that though there is no prohibition involved, it is not desirable to eat even a snack of bread outside the sukkah.<br>", "the measure of a k'beitzah or less, - The Mishnah (ibid.) relates that less than a <i>k'beitzah</i> of bread was brought once to Rabbi Tzadok and he ate it outside the sukkah.<br>", "or even slightly more. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 639:2) restricts the leniency to a <i>k'beitzah</i> (approximately 56 cubic centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and, in this instance, 41 cubic centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>) alone (See <i>Tosafot, Yoma</i> 79a.) The same principles are also applied to cooked foods made from the five species of grain.<br>", "One may not sleep outside the sukkah at all, even a brief nap. - In contrast to eating, where there is a difference between a fixed meal and a snack, no such difference exists regarding sleep. At times, even a rest of a few moments can have a major effect on a person. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 26a; Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:5.)<br>At present, there are many communities where leniency is taken in this regard. In some climates, the cold will cause everyone to consider sleeping in the sukkah as uncomfortable and, hence, they are freed of that obligation. Furthermore, in many communities, there is also a danger involved. In addition, if a husband would sleep in a sukkah, he would deprive his wife of some of the happiness and satisfaction that should accompany a festival. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:2.)<br>Nevertheless, many authorities explain that these leniencies apply only at night, but during the day one is obligated to sleep in the sukkah.<br>", "It is permissible to drink water - or any other beverage, including wine (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:2), outside the sukkah.

In contrast, meat, fish, cheese, and other substantial foods which form the basis of a meal must be eaten in a sukkah. While many later halachic authorities do not accept this view, some maintain that one should not sit down with company to a meal of such foods outside a sukkah.

They said: \"Take them up to the sukkah.\"<i>Sukkah</i> 26b explains that often our Sages counselled against accepting extra stringencies upon oneself, lest one take pride in one's piety.

However, one is obligated to eat three meals on the Sabbath as an expression of the mitzvah of honoring the Sabbath and taking pleasure in its celebration. (See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:9.) Similarly, one is required to eat festive meals on the first day of Sukkot in honor of the holiday. These meals must be eaten in the sukkah.<br>", "The same laws apply as regards the eating of matzah on Pesach. - The Rambam's intent is that, as explained in <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:1, after the first night of the festival a person is not obligated to eat matzah and may subsist on other foods. Similarly, on Sukkot one may eat foods that do not require consumption within a sukkah.<br>However, according to most authorities, his choice of words is not exact. The mitzvah of sukkah differs from that of matzah. In the latter instance, there is no mitzvah involved in eating matzah after the first night of the holiday. In contrast, every activity performed in the sukkah constitutes a further fulfillment of the mitzvah.<br>Accordingly, after the first night of the festival no special blessing is recited before partaking of matzah.

In the latter instance, in essence, the person is obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. However, because of his discomfort, his obligation is temporarily waived. In contrast, when rain descends it is impossible to fulfill the mitzvah at all, because the sukkah is not fit to dwell in. Hence, there is no obligation whatsoever.<br>There is a practical difference between these two abstract positions regarding the question whether a person is obligated to eat in the sukkah on the first night of the holiday even when it rains. (See the commentary on Halachah 7.) According to the <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>, under these circumstances there is no mitzvah which one is required to fulfill. Thus, one may eat at home. In contrast, most authorities do not differentiate between rain and other uncomfortable situations. Thus, since eating in the sukkah on that night is a binding obligation, they require a person to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>There is a further aspect to this concept. The Maharil explains that a person who eats in a sukkah when he is not obligated to do so is a simple person and receives no reward for his \"piety.\" On this basis, in many communities, people make no effort to stay in the sukkah when it rains. In contrast, there are some communities where people will continue to eat in the sukkah despite pouring rain.<br>What is the difference between these two approaches? The first approach follows the perspective that, during the rain, there is no mitzvah to dwell in the sukkah whatsoever. Hence, there is no need to strain oneself to remain there. In contrast, the second perspective does not differentiate between rain and any other uncomfortable circumstances, but maintains that, in essence, dwelling in the sukkah is a mitzvah even under such circumstances. Accordingly, they remain in the sukkah, because while they are involved in fulfilling God's will they do not feel even the slightest trace of discomfort.<br>", "When is one permitted to leave [the sukkah]? - The Maharil writes that when a person is forced to leave the sukkah because of rain, he should depart with humility rather than with anger.<br>", "when enough raindrops descend into the sukkah so that they would spoil a cooked dish - We need not wait until the food actually spoils. As soon as enough rain descends to spoil the food, one is free to enter one's home (Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:5).<br>", "even a dish of beans - i.e., a dish made from bean meal, which spoils quickly (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:8).<br>", "were they to fall into it.<br>", "If a person was eating in the sukkah and rain descended, and hence, he entered his home, if the rains stop, we do not obligate him to return to his sukkah - to finish his meal...<br>", "{that entire night} - This phrase is set off by brackets because it is most likely a printing error. It is not easily understood, nor is it found in the manuscript copies of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> or in the quotation of this halachah in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 639:6).<br>", "until he is finished eating. - However, after he concludes eating he must return to the sukkah.<br>", "If he was sleeping and rain descended - The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:7) emphasizes that even the slightest amount of rain is sufficient to free one from the obligation of sleeping in the sukkah.<br>", "and hence, he entered his home, we do not obligate him to return to his sukkah that entire night should the rains cease. - The same law applies if it was raining when he desired to go to sleep, and hence, he never slept in the sukkah at all (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:39).<br>", "Rather, he may remain sleeping that entire night in his house - even if he wakes up in the middle of the night and it is no longer raining, he is not required to move to the sukkah.<br>", "until dawn. - The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and Rabbenu Manoach note that the Rambam's choice of phraseology implies that the person cannot sleep his normal measure, but must rise at dawn to return to the sukkah. They are not stringent and allow the person to remain sleeping at home until he wakes up. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 639:7) quotes the Rambam's statements verbatim. However, the Ramah includes this leniency.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.11": ["A person should not take apart his sukkah after he finishes eating on the seventh day [of Sukkot]. - lest he require it later during the day.<br>", "However, from the afternoon on, he may take down his utensils and remove them - Keeping one's utensils in the sukkah is included in the mitzvah of dwelling within it, as mentioned in Halachah 5. Nevertheless, one is allowed to take them home to prepare them for use on Shemini Atzeret as a sign of deference to that holiday. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 4:7.)<br>", "If he has no place to put the utensils - i.e., if he used his home as a sukkah, and thus must continue to remain there on Shemini Atzeret (see <i>Sukkah</i> 48a)...<br>", "he should reduce its space - by opening up [a portion of s'chach]<br>", "at least four handbreadths by four handbreadths - to make the sukkah, or at least a significant portion of it, unfit for use.

These acts will differentiate between his eating in the sukkah during the festival, when he is required to do so in fulfillment of the mitzvah, and eating there afterwards, once the mitzvah has been completed (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 666).<br>The Ramah adds that this requirement applies only when one desires to eat in the sukkah on Shemini Atzeret. Once that holiday passes, one may eat in a sukkah without making any changes.<br>", "If he has to eat later that day - even if he has removed his utensils or taken away part of the <i>s'chach</i>...<br>", "he must eat in the sukkah, because the mitzvah extends throughout the seven days.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.12": ["Whenever a person enters a sukkah with the intention of sitting down throughout the seven [days of Sukkot], he should recite the following blessing - Note the commentary on Halachah 7, which explains the difference between this law and the rules governing the blessing recited before eating matzah.<br>", "before sitting - The Rambam maintains that by sitting or doing any other activity which one would perform in one's home in the sukkah, one fulfills the mitzvah. Hence, the blessing is recited before one performs the mitzvah, as required by <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:2.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions why the blessing is not recited before one enters the sukkah, noting that the interpretation of the command \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1 \u05d1\u05e1\u05d5\u05db\u05d4 is \"to dwell in the sukkah,\" not \"to sit in the sukkah.\" However, the <i>Taz</i> 643:2 explains that merely passing through the sukkah is not part of the mitzvah. Rather, one must perform an activity that reflects \"dwelling.\" Hence, the blessing is not recited until one sits down, because previously it is not obvious that one wants to perform a significant activity in the sukkah.<br>The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision, maintaining that one should recite the blessing only before partaking of a meal in the sukkah. This reflects the decision of the Ashkenazic authorities, who maintain that though the performance of all one's activities in the sukkah is a mitzvah, it is not customary to recite the blessing except when eating. When reciting the blessing on that occasion, one should intend to include all other activities. (See <i>Tur</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:8.)<br>", "[Blessed are You...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to dwell in the sukkah. - The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that there is no limit to the number of times one recites the blessing each day. Nevertheless, if one left the sukkah for a brief interval or left with the intent of performing an activity which would improve the sukkah, that departure is not considered an interruption and no blessing is required upon one's return.<br>", "On the first night of the festival, one should first recite the blessing on the sukkah, and then the blessing for the occasion - i.e., the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i>, which thanks God for enabling us to reach this occasion. This blessing is recited whenever one performs a mitzvah that can be fulfilled only from time to time (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:9).<br>That halachah and, similarly, <i>Sukkah</i> 46a, imply that, at the outset, one should recite the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> upon construction of the sukkah. Though the Rambam makes no mention of that concept here, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 641:1) states that one should have the construction of the sukkah in mind when reciting <i>shehecheyanu</i> at night.<br>", "One should recite all the blessings over a cup of wine - as did Rav Kahana (<i>Sukkah</i> 46a).<br>", "Thus, one should recite kiddush - for the festival<br>", "while standing - The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 643:2) states that kiddush may be recited while sitting.<br>", "recite the blessing leishev basukkah - Though one might presume that <i>shehecheyanu</i> would be recited first, since it is more frequent, precedence is given to <i>leishev basukkah</i>, because it is \"the mitzvah of the day\" (Rabbenu Manoach).<br>", "sit, and then recite the blessing shehecheyanu. - On the second night, it is Ashkenazic custom to recite to the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> before the blessing <i>leishev basukkah</i>, since on that occasion the blessing is associated with the celebration of the festival and not the mitzvah of sukkah. (See <i>Bnei Binyamin</i>.)<br>", "This was the custom of my teachers and the Rabbis - Rav Kapach notes that most of the manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 \"the great men of\" and not \u05e8\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9, \"the Rabbis of.\"<br>", "of Spain - The Ra'avad objects and comments that even in Spain such a custom was not followed.<br>", "to recite kiddush while standing on the first night of the Sukkot festival, as explained.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.13": ["At present - in the Diaspora and in certain places in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> (<i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i>, Chapter 9)<br>", "when we celebrate holidays for two days - because originally, the messengers sent by the Sanhedrin could not reach there in time to notify them when the holiday should be celebrated. Hence, even now, when we follow the fixed calendar, we continue to follow this custom.

Indeed, in Halachot 11 and 14, we find certain safeguards instituted because of this commandment. Nevertheless, dwelling in the sukkah on the eighth day does not constitute a violation of this commandment, because the time when the mitzvah is to be performed has already passed. Placing a fifth passage in one's tefillin during the day violates this commandment, because we are obligated to perform the mitzvah at this time. However, once the seven days of Sukkot pass, there is no mitzvah associated with the sukkah whatsoever (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28b).<br>Nevertheless, many Ashkenazic authorities would carry out additional safeguards regarding this matter. For example, the <i>Tur</i> relates (though he opposes this practice himself) that some follow the custom of eating in the Sukkah only on the day of Shemini Atzeret, but not the night. Many of the Rabbis who would sleep in the Sukkah throughout the festival refrain from doing so on Shemini Atzeret. (See <i>K'tav Sofer</i>, Responsum 120.)<br>", "On the eighth day, which is the first day of the holiday of Shemini Atzeret - As its name implies, Shemini Atzeret is the eighth day of Sukkot. However, it also has certain aspects in which it is considered a holiday in its own right (<i>Sukkah</i> 48a).<br>", "we dwell in the sukkah, but do not recite the blessing leishev basukkah. - because as the Rambam explains, a blessing is not recited when a mitzvah is performed only because of a doubt.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 47a relates that \"Rav Huna bar Bizna and all the great Sages of the generation dwelled in a sukkah on the eighth day - which might have been the seventh day - [of the festival], but did not recite a blessing.\"<br>", "Similarly, a tumtum and an androgynous - See Chapter 2, Halachah 1 for a definition of these terms and these individuals' status.<br>", "never recite the blessing leishev basukkah, because their obligation [to perform the mitzvah is based] on doubt - i.e., they are required to perform the mitzvah because of the doubt concerning their status: maybe they are to be considered men.<br>", "and a blessing is never recited when one is doubtful [of one's obligation]. - This follows the rationale that when there is a doubt concerning one's obligation in matters required by the Torah itself, one must follow the more stringent view. However, regarding obligations of a Rabbinic nature, one may opt towards leniency. Since the mitzvah is required by the Torah, even a person in doubt must perform it. However, the blessing is a Rabbinic requirement; hence, there is no necessity in reciting it. Furthermore, by reciting the blessing when one is not required, one uses God's name in vain.<br>This perspective is not accepted by all authorities. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Ashkenazic practice is to allow women and others who are not obligated in the performance of a mitzvah to recite a blessing when fulfilling it.<br>The above applies only regarding the doubts concerning the obligations of a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynous</i>. However, on Shemini Atzeret, when there is a doubt concerning the obligation of the entire Jewish people even the Ashkenazic authorities would agree that a blessing should not be recited.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.14": ["After a person finishes eating on the eighth day [of Sukkot], he should take down his utensils and remove them - from the sukkah and bring them home, where he will eat on Simchat Torah.<br>", "When a person has no place to put the utensils - and desires to continue eating in the sukkah on Simchat Torah,<br>", "[the following rules - safeguards adopted to differentiate between eating in the sukkah as required, and eating there afterwards<br>", "apply]: If it is a small [sukkah], he should bring his candelabra into it - As mentioned in Halachah 5, a candelabra should not be brought into a small sukkah for Sukkot.<br>It must be noted that the Rambam changes the text of <i>Sukkah</i> 48a, which states: \"light his lamp there.\" (See <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Halachah 5.)<br>", "if it is a large sukkah, he should bring in his pots, plates, and the like - which are generally kept outside the sukkah, as explained in Halachah 5.<br>", "to bring to mind that it - the sukkah<br>", "is no longer acceptable and that its mitzvah is completed.<br>", "Since the day is a holiday, one may not reduce its space and nullify it. - as suggested in Halachah 11.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.15": ["A person who did not construct a sukkah [before the holiday] - whether intentionally or unintentionally - <i>Sukkah</i> 27b explains that not only a person whose sukkah fell down in the middle of the festival should reconstruct it, but even one who never built a sukkah at all is entitled to do so.<br>", "should construct a sukkah on Chol Hamo'ed. - The literal translation of Deuteronomy 16:13 is: \"Make the Sukkot festival for seven days.\" <i>Sukkah</i> 27b interprets this verse to mean that a sukkah may be built during the seven days of the festival.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 2:7) explains that Rabbi Eleazar wanted to forbid a person who purposely did not build a sukkah from doing so during the festival, as a punishment for his failure to prepare for the festival.

When discussing this matter, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 36:3) mentions the obligation to place crowns on the letters, \u05e9\u05e2\u05d8\u05e0\"\u05d6 \u05d2\"\u05e5. The obligation of placing crowns on these letters is explicitly mentioned in the Talmud, <i>Menachot</i> 29b. Hence, they are regarded with greater stringency.<br>Afterwards, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also states that there are scribes who customarily place crowns on other letters. Significantly, even in Yemen, where the Rambam's directives are usually adhered to precisely, an exception is made in this instance, and there are different customs with regard to the crowns placed upon letters.<br>5. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (36:5) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (36:15) require that one add any crowns that are lacking in the passages. This refers, however, to the crowns on the letters, \u05e9\u05e2\u05d8\u05e0\"\u05d6 \u05d2\"\u05e5, and not to the crowns required by the Rambam.<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.10": ["A person who purchases <i>tefillin</i> from a person who is not an expert - Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 39:8), which states: \"One should not purchase [tefillin] from a person who is not an expert.\"<br>", "is required to inspect them - checking to see that no extra letters were added, no letters were omitted, and that each letter is formed correctly.<br>[The <i>Shulchan Aruch's</i> directive and the importance of checking <i>tefillin</i> today must be emphasized, because many scribes, particularly those who write inexpensive <i>tefillin</i>, are not experts.

A pair of <i>tefillin</i> which is not worn on a regular basis should be checked twice in seven years. The later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 39:11 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:26) suggest checking even <i>tefillin</i> that are worn regularly. At present, perhaps because of the differences in the way the compartments are made or in the parchment or ink that is used, it is very common for letters in <i>tefillin</i> to smudge, fade, and crack.

The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) explains that although this mitzvah is not associated with a specific time, since women are not obligated to study Torah, they are also not required to fulfill this mitzvah. Note the <i>Sha'agat Arieh</i> (Responsum 35), who objects and obligates women in this mitzvah.<br>", "to write a Torah scroll for himself, as [implied by the commandment (Deuteronomy 31:19 ]: \"And now, write down - Although this command was addressed to Moses, the fact that the plural form of the word \"write\" is used indicates that the command was addressed to the entire people.<br>", "this song - the song <i>Ha'azinu</i><br>", "for yourselves,\" - The above is a quote from <i>Sanhedrin</i> 21b.

Alternatively, a person will be far more motivated to study in a new scroll which he produced himself.<br>", "If a person writes the scroll by hand, it is considered as if he received it on Mount Sinai. - Taking the effort to write the scroll oneself indicates that, had the person lived at the time the Torah was given, he also would have joined the Jews in traveling to Mount Sinai to receive it (<i>Nimukei Yosef, Menachot</i>).<br>", "If he does not know how to write - a scroll according to all the particular halachic requirements<br>", "himself, [he should have] others write it for him. - i.e., he should hire a scribe or purchase a Torah scroll. <i>Menachot</i> 30a states: \"A person who purchases a Torah scroll in the public market is like someone who grabs a mitzvah in the marketplace.\" Rashi maintains that purchasing a Torah scroll fulfills a mitzvah, but the mitzvah is not as complete as if one had written the scroll oneself. The Ramah, however, states (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 270:1) that if a person merely purchases a Torah scroll without checking it, he does not fulfill the mitzvah at all.<br>Note the statements of the <i>Tevuot Shor</i>, which explain that if another person can perform a mitzvah in a more complete manner than one is able to do oneself, it is preferable to commission him to do so as one's agent. In this instance, since most people cannot write a Torah scroll as attractive and halachically accurate as a professional scribe, it is preferable to hire the latter to write one's scroll.<br>", "Anyone who checks even a single letter of a Torah scroll is considered as if he wrote the entire scroll. - Unless the scroll is checked, it cannot be used (See Halachah 12). Checking also involves effort.<br>In his <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i>, Rabbenu Asher explains that, at present, this mitzvah is also fulfilled by writing <i>chumashim</i>, texts of the Talmud, and other books of Torah law. This concept is also quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 270:2).<br>The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (270:4) explains that Rabbenu Asher's intention was not that there is no longer a mitzvah in writing a Torah scroll (for it is impossible that a change in circumstance will nullify a Biblical command), but that the original mitzvah has been extended to include these other texts.<br>Since even according to Rabbenu Asher's view, there is a mitzvah for each person to write a Torah scroll for himself, it is difficult to comprehend why we do not see many individuals trying to fulfill this mitzvah. This question is particularly pertinent in light of the Rambam's statements at the conclusion of the list of positive commandments in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, where he describes the writing of a Torah scroll as a mitzvah which a person is obligated to fulfill.<br>It is possible to explain that since many people are not capable of actually writing a Torah scroll themselves and do not have the financial resources to purchase one and check it, they fulfill this mitzvah through purchasing letters in a Torah scroll written by the community (<i>Pit'chei Teshuvah</i> 270:1; <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24).<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 7.2": ["A king is commanded to write another Torah scroll - <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 17) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 503) count this mitzvah as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>", "for himself, for the sake of his sovereignty - This scroll must be written while the king is in office.

In response to the same question, <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> 30a explains that the study of the Babylonian Talmud also fulfills that directive, because it combines all three areas of study in a single text.<br>At present, this pattern of study is not followed even in the early stages of a child's learning.

Thus, the emphasis was on teaching students by rote.b) Hebrew was a spoken language and, therefore, it was not necessary to spend time teaching the children the meaning of the subject matter.<br>At present, the major emphasis is on teaching learning skills and developing a student's powers of comprehension with the understanding that once one knows how to study, since the texts are easily available, he will be able to apply himself to the actual study at his convenience.

The Hebrew word <i>mitzvah</i> (commandment) shares the same root as the word <i>tzavtah</i> (connection). Fulfilling the commandments establishes a transcendent bond with Godliness. In contrast, a good deed that is not commanded, no matter how worthy, remains an act of man and does not establish such a connection.<br>", "Even though she will receive a reward, the Sages commanded that a person should not teach his daughter Torah - There is no explicit source for the Rambam's statements, though one may draw such a conclusion from <i>Sotah</i> 20a. That passage relates that one prominent sage, ben Azzai, did not share this opinion.<br>As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1, the Rabbis require a woman to study the laws governing the mitzvot which she is obligated to fulfill. Based on that decision, many commentaries explain that the Rambam's statements refer only to intensive study of the subject matter described as <i>Gemara</i> in the previous halachot.<br>", "because most women - Commentaries have mentioned that by adding the word \"most,\" the Rambam implies that if a father sees that his daughter is capable of such study, he should afford her the opportunity.<br>", "cannot concentrate their attention on study, and thus transform the words of Torah into idle matters because of their lack of understanding. - <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> notes the contrast between the first clause, \"A woman who studies,\" and the command the Sages gave \"a father.\" He differentiates between study that a woman undertakes voluntarily, which is considered desirable, and a father's training his daughter in matters which are not necessarily relevant to her.<br>", "[Thus,] our Sages declared: - <i>Sotah</i> 21b<br>", "\"Whoever teaches his daughter Torah is like one who teaches her tales and parables.\" - Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sotah</i> 3:3). From <i>Sotah</i> 21b, it would appear that <i>tiflos</i> (translated as \u201cidle matters\u201d) could be understood as \"romance.\" The Meiri renders it as \"vanity,\" explaining that a woman who has studied will boast of her achievements.<br>", "This applies to the Oral Law. [With regard to] the Written Law: at the outset, one should not teach one's daughter. However, if one teaches her, it is not considered as if she was taught idle things. - Though the Rambam's statements are quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 246:6), the source for his statements has been questioned.<br>Some point to the Mishnah, <i>Nedarim</i> 3:3, which, in passing, mentions a daughter's study of the Written Law. However, the Rambam's own text of that Mishnah lacks the words \"or daughter.\" Others point to <i>Chaggigah</i> 3a (and more specifically, to the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>ibid.</i> 1:1), which describes the reading of the Torah by the king during the <i>Hakhel</i> celebration, which women were also required to attend. Nevertheless, there is a difference between study of the Written Law in its entirety and hearing the reading of a few inspirational passages. (See <i>Taz</i> 246:4.)<br>In this context, it might be noted that the <i>Tur's</i> text of the Rambam reverses these statements and mentioned teaching women the Oral Law as preferable to the Written Law. This can easily be reconciled with the opinions mentioned above, which require a woman to learn the laws governing the mitzvot she is obligated to fulfill. In contrast, the Written Law is a less closely defined field of study.

The Talmud answers<br>", "because it - the outer booth<br>", "is not a permanent structure - and only an entrance of a permanent nature can be considered an \"entrance to an entrance\" and is required to have a <i>mezuzah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

The room which is closer to the entrance to the house is considered as leading to the room which is further removed, and the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed on the right side of the entrance to the latter room;<br>b) The importance of the rooms. The room which is less important is considered as leading into the room which is more important, and the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed on the right side of the entrance to the latter room.These principles are also significant if an entrance has no doors or has sliding doors.

Rabbenu Yonah suggests that the light has a calming effect, allowing one to concentrate on his prayers.<br>", "that face Jerusalem and pray opposite them, - in keeping with the obligation to face Jerusalem mentioned in Halachah 3.<br>", "as [Daniel 6:11] states: \"...and he had windows open in his room facing Jerusalem\" - The verse concludes: \"...and he kneeled on his knees three times a day and prayed.\"<br>", "A person should establish a fixed place where he always prays. - <i>Berachot</i> 6b states: \"Anyone who establishes a fixed place for his prayer will be assisted by the God of Abraham.\" Abraham is mentioned because, as can be inferred from Genesis 19:27, he had a fixed place for prayer.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 4:4, states that even in a synagogue, a person should have a fixed place for prayer and should not move from place to place.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 90:19 quotes this law. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> adds that within four cubits (approx. six feet) of one's place is also considered acceptable, since it is impossible to be in exactly the same spot at all times. Therefore, a person who finds a colleague sitting in one's place in the synagogue, may pray within four cubits of his place. This is preferable to embarrassing the person sitting in his seat, who might very well be a visitor and not be aware of which seats are occupied by regular congregants.<br>", "One should not pray in a destroyed building - This halachah is derived within the context of the following narrative (<i>Berachot</i> 3a):<br>Rabbi Yossi said: Once I was walking on the road and I entered one of the destroyed buildings of Jerusalem in order to pray. Eliyahu [the Prophet] of blessed memory came and waited for me by the entrance until I had finished praying.After I finished my prayer, he greeted me: \"Peace unto you, Rebbe.\"I replied to him: \"Peace unto you, Rebbe and teacher.\"He asked me: \"My son, why did you enter this destroyed building?\"I answered him: \"To pray.\"He told me: \"You should have prayed in the road.\"<br>The Talmud mentions that one should never enter a destroyed building on any account. Nevertheless, since the Talmud made this statement regarding Rabbi Yossi's prayer, the Rambam teaches the laws concerning destroyed buildings here in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "nor should one pray behind a synagogue unless he turns his face towards the synagogue. - <i>Berachot</i> 6b states: \"Anyone praying behind a synagogue is called wicked,... this applies only when he faces away from the synagogue, but if he faces the synagogue there is no problem.\"<br>Rashi (in <i>Berachot</i> 6b) states that by facing away from the synagogue when one prays, one appears to deny God who is worshiped within. Therefore, even if facing the synagogue requires one to turn away from Jerusalem, it is desirable.<br><i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Eruvin</i> 18b, explains that this refers to a person standing on the side of the door facing away from the synagogue, and thus towards the opposite direction of those worshipping inside. Therefore, he must simply turn the other way and solve the problem. <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> suggests that \u201cbehind a synagogue\u201d may even refer to standing on the side of the synagogue and looking away.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:7) mentions all these possibilities and rules that one should refrain from praying in any of these places.<br>", "It is forbidden to sit down next to someone in the midst of the Amidah - <i>Berachot</i> 31b refers to Chanah's prayers for a son and her subsequent remarks to Eli, the priest: \"I am the woman who stood here with you\" (I Samuel 1:26 . This verses indicates that Eli, as well as Chanah, was standing at the time.<br>Rabbenu Yonah also mentions that this applies only to a person sitting idly, but one studying or reciting the <i>Shema</i> need not worry and may continue to sit.<br>", "or to pass in front of him - for walking in front of someone will disrupt that person's concentration.<br>Rabbenu Yonah (commenting on <i>Berachot</i> 27a) explains that this refers only to \"in front of him,\" but not to the side.<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 102:5) points out that the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshat Chayei Sarah</i>) mentions that passing on the side is also forbidden.The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 102:5 mentions a practical application of this halachah:<br>If one completes his <i>Amidah</i> when a colleague is praying behind him, he is forbidden from taking his three steps [backwards] until the person behind him finishes his <i>Amidah</i>. Were he to [step backwards], he is like one passing before another in the midst of the <i>Amidah</i>. One must be especially careful in this, even if the last one began his <i>Amidah</i> after the first person.<br>", "except at a distance of four cubits - which is not likely to distract one's colleague.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.7": ["One should not stand in a place three or more handbreadths high - A handbreadth is the size of a fist: approximately 8 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>. Based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>, anything lower than three handbreadths is considered to be part of the ground itself.<br>", "and pray - <i>Berachot</i> 10b mentions this and the following laws within the context of the requirement to pray in a low place stated in the previous halachah.<br>", "[Similarly, he should not pray while standing] on a bed, bench, or chair - The special mention of these objects requires explanation, since presumably, they would be included in the general category of a place three handbreadths or more high. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) quotes Rabbi Yitzchak Abuhav as suggesting that it is forbidden to pray while standing on these objects even if they are less than three handbreadths high. Even at this low height, a person may be unable to concentrate out of fear that he might fall.<br>The <i>Prisha</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) maintains that it is unlikely that a person would fear falling from such a low height and offers a different rationale. He explains that these objects constitute a separation between the person and the ground. In the Temple, the sacrificial service could be performed only while one was standing directly on the ground. Therefore, our prayers must be recited in a similar manner.<br>", "A raised platform that has a surface area of four cubits by four cubits which is the [minimum] size of a house, - This measure is also significant in regard to the laws of property and the prohibition of transferring from one domain to another on the Sabbath.<br>", "is considered like an attic. - i.e., it is considered a space in its own right rather than a raised area within a larger space.<br>", "Thus, one is permitted to pray there. - <i>Migdal Oz</i> points out that on the basis of this halachah, the leader of the congregation often stands on a raised platform in the synagogue in order that he be heard by all the congregants.<br>", "Similarly, if it is surrounded by walls, even if it is not four cubits by four cubits, - though it lacks the necessary size, its walls cause it to be considered as an independent entity. Hence,...<br>", "one may pray there, since its height is not noticeable, because it constitutes an area unto itself. - i.e., because of the walls, no one will worry about falling despite the height.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.8": ["Craftsmen - who are hired to work for others by the hour or day, in contrast, to a person working on his own time.<br>", "working at the top of a tree or on top of a board - In his commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 2:4, the Rambam explains the meaning of the word \u05e0\u05d3\u05d1\u05da as follows:<br>The custom of those building a wall of earth (as opposed to bricks or stones) was to set up two large boards of wood and throw the earth in between them. They would pack it tight with wooden tools until it had the shape of a wall, and then tie [the two boards together.] Afterwards, they would remove the boards from the structure they had built...<br>\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d3\u05d1\u05da means \"on top of the wall at the time that they are packing (the earth) between the boards that are called \u05e0\u05d3\u05d1\u05db\u05d9\u05dd.\"<br>", "or wall when the time of the Amidah arrives must descend in order to pray, - The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 16a) contrasts the <i>Shema</i> which these individuals may recite in their places and prayer, which requires that they descend. The difference is that, in the <i>Shema</i>, intense concentration is only required when reciting the first verse, while the entire <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> should be recited with such intention. Hence, it is likely that in such precarious positions, the fear of falling will prevent a person from maintaining his concentration for this prolonged period. See also <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i>, Chapter 2, Halachah 4.<br>", "and then return to their work. - i.e., though they are hired workers and thus, their time is not their own, nevertheless, they are granted the time to fulfill their fundamental religious obligations in the proper manner. However, after discharging those duties, they must return to work immediately.<br>", "If they were at the top of an olive or fig tree, they may pray where they are because of the excessive effort [involved in descending]. - <i>Berachot</i> 16a differentiates between these trees and those of other species. Rashi explains that the danger of falling from these trees is minimal because of their thick branches, and, therefore, one may stand there firmly and pray.<br>The Rambam, based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 2:5, explains that the wide branches make the descent problematical, and, therefore, the workers may pray in the trees themselves.<br>", "What it is that they pray? If they are working for meals alone they recite three Amidahs of 19 blessings - <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) arrives at this differentiation based on an apparent contradiction between two <i>beraitot</i>, one stating that workers must recite the entire <i>Amidah</i>, and the other stating that the abridged version is sufficient.<br>Those working for daily wages are in effect paid by the hour and must use their time for their employer in the fullest manner possible. In contrast, implicit in an agreement to work for meals is that a high rate of productivity is not expected from such a worker. Hence, he is granted greater leniency.<br>", "If they are working for wages, they recite \"Give us understanding\" - i.e., the abridged version of the <i>Amidah</i>, discussed in Chapter 2, Halachot 2-4.<br>", "In either case, they do not lead the congregation - nor participate in communal prayer because of the additional time involved. Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 16a) also agrees that this applies even to one working for meals.<br>", "or lift up their hands [to bless the people] - i.e., if the artisan is a <i>Cohen</i> he should not bless the people during the repetition of the <i>Amidah</i>.

A person should not raise his voice during his Amidah - <i>Berachot</i> 31a explains that these laws are derived from the description of Channah's prayer (I Samuel 1:13 : \"Channah spoke unto her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard.\"<br>", "nor should he pray silently - i.e., merely contemplating on the words of prayer in his heart. The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 4:1, states that the phrase, \"only her lips moved,\" implies that she was speaking, not only thinking to herself.<br>", "Rather, he should pronounce the words with his lips, whispering in a tone that he can hear - <i>Sotah</i> 32b relates: \"Why did they decree that the <i>Amidah</i> must be whispered? In order that those who have transgressed will not be embarrassed.\"<br>Rashi explains that transgressors confess their sins before God during the <i>Amidah</i>, and, therefore, the Sages ruled that the entire <i>Amidah</i> should be recited in a hushed tone so that people would not feel embarrassed to confess.<br>", "He should not make his voice audible - The first clause of this halachah implies that one should not raise his voice and speak very loudly during the <i>Amidah</i>. This clause teaches that one should not even speak in a normal tone of voice.<br>Both of these laws are based on <i>Berachot</i> 24b:<br>One who makes his voice audible during the <i>Amidah</i> is among those of little faith (i.e., he seems to indicate that it is necessary to speak loudly in order that God should hear him - Rashi).One who raises his voice in the <i>Amidah</i> is among the false prophets. (Rashi explains that this is based on I Kings 18:28, which describes the actions of the false prophets of Ba'al: \"And they called out loudly.\")<br><i>Lechem Yehudah</i> notes that the mention of both these halachot is somewhat unnecessary. The prohibition of making one's voice audible alone would appear to be sufficient. However, since that prohibition is lifted on occasion as explained below, the Rambam mentioned also the first law which is followed regardless of the circumstances involved.<br>", "unless he is sick or cannot concentrate otherwise, - When stating the abovementioned restriction, <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that it can be relaxed in this eventuality.<br>", "In such a case, it is permitted except when in a congregation, lest the others be disturbed by his voice. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 101 allows an exception to this rule on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. On these days, people devote more concentration to their prayers. Also, they generally pray from a prayerbook. Therefore, they are less likely to be disturbed by someone else's voice. Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> notes that the Zohar suggests praying in a hushed tone even on these days.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.10": ["Bowing, - The bows in the <i>Amidah</i> are intended to express the concept of complete abnegation of self (See <i>Tanya,</i> Chapters 39 and 42).<br>", "what is implied?

This perspective, however, is not accepted by other authorities, who explain that surely, the Rambam requires order within the passages. He gave the above example only because he felt that it was more important to emphasize that even if the passages themselves were written in order, if their order was reversed, the <i>mezuzah</i> is not acceptable.<br>", "If one writes a <i>mezuzah</i> on two different parchments, it is not acceptable even if they were sewn together [later]. - In his Responsa (213), Rabbi Akiva Eiger writes that if the parchments were sewn together before the passages were written upon them, the <i>mezuzah</i> is acceptable.<br>", "A <i>mezuzah</i> should not be made from a Torah scroll - i.e., one may not cut the passage, <i>Shema</i>, from a worn Torah scroll and write the passage, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>, on the empty space below it. One may not cut both passages from the Torah scroll since, as explained above, a <i>mezuzah</i> may not be written on two different parchments (<i>Siftei Cohen, Yoreh De'ah</i> 290:1).<br>", "or <i>tefillin</i> that have become worn - Though it is possible to cut the two passages from the arm <i>tefillin</i>, it is forbidden to do so.<br>", "nor should a <i>mezuzah</i> be written on the empty parchment from a Torah scroll - the empty parchment left as a border above and on the sides of the Torah scroll. The <i>Or Sameach</i> notes that<i>Shabbat</i> 116a questions whether or not these empty portions of parchment have become sanctified with the holiness of a Torah scroll, and does not resolve the issue. Because of the doubt involved, the Rambam rules that in situations where the question of their holiness is raised, one should always take the more stringent perspective. Therefore, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 23:27, the Rambam rules that they should not be saved from a fire on the Sabbath if the violation of even a Rabbinic transgression is involved (accepting the possibility that they have not become consecrated). In this halachah, this approach requires accepting the possibility that they have been consecrated.<br>", "because one should not lower an article from a higher level of holiness - As explained in Chapter 10, Halachot 2-5 (see also <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 11:14), the holiness of a Torah scroll surpasses that of all other articles.<br>", "to a lesser one. - Our Sages have established the principle, \"One may ascend to a higher level of holiness, but may not descend to a lower one.\"<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.2": ["It is a mitzvah to leave a space between the passage, Shema, and the passage, V'hayah im shamo'a, as if it were s'tumah. - <i>S'tumah</i> means \"closed.\" According to the Rambam, it refers to a passage whose first word is always written in the middle of a line in the Torah. See Chapter 8, Halachah 2. In the Torah, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> is <i>s'tumah</i>.<br>", "If space were left as if it were p'tuchah - <i>P'tuchah</i> means \"open.\" According to the Rambam, it refers to a passage whose first word is always written at the beginning of a line in the Torah. See Chapter 8, Halachah 1.<br>", "it is acceptable, since these passages do not follow each other in the Torah. - Note the contrast between this ruling and the Rambam's decision in Chapter 2, Halachah 2, regarding <i>tefillin</i>: \"If one wrote a passage which should be <i>s'tumah</i> as <i>p'tuchah</i> or a passage which should be <i>p'tuchah</i> as <i>s'tumah</i>, it is unacceptable.\"<br>The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32) explains the difference as follows: In <i>tefillin</i>, there are passages which follow directly after each other in the Torah. Therefore, all the passages must be written as they appear in a Torah scroll. In contrast, the two passages contained in a <i>mezuzah</i> do not follow each other in the Torah. Therefore, there is no absolute requirement for the passages to be written as they appear in the Torah.<br>", "One must take care regarding the crowns - See Chapter 2, Halachot 8-9 and Chapter 7, Halachot 8-9.<br>", "[on the letters] in a <i>mezuzah</i>.

Furthermore, such people are included among those who deny the Torah, because they relate to the words of the Torah as if they are cures for the body, when, in fact, they are cures for the soul, as [Proverbs 3:22] states: \"And they shall be life for your soul.\"<br>The inclusion of these people among \"those who do not have a portion in the world to come\" is based on <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, which makes such a statement about \"those who deny the Torah.\"<br>", "Not only do these fools nullify the mitzvah - As stated in the previous halachah, any addition made on the inside of the <i>mezuzah</i> invalidates it. (Significantly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 288:15 states that it is forbidden to add to the inside of the <i>mezuzah</i>, but does not explicitly say that the <i>mezuzah</i> becomes invalidated.)<br>", "but furthermore, they make from a great mitzvah [which reflects] the unity of the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, the love of Him, and the service of Him - These are the subjects discussed in the two passages written within the <i>mezuzah</i>.<br>", "a talisman for their own benefit. They, in their foolish conception, think that this will help them regarding the vanities of the world. - The Rambam's statements have aroused questions from many commentaries who note that, in several places, the Talmud associates a <i>mezuzah</i> with Divine protection - e.g., <i>Menachot</i> 33b, the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> resolves this difficulty explaining that, although a <i>mezuzah</i> affords Divine protection, that protection comes, in and of itself, in reward for the fulfillment of the mitzvah. There is no need for any additions on man's part. Indeed, a person who makes additions to the <i>mezuzah</i> in an attempt to increase its influence demonstrates that he is concerned with \"his own benefit\" and \"the vanities of the world\" and not with the fulfillment of God's mitzvah. Therefore, he deserves the Rambam's severe words of criticism. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 19.1. Our translation follows the standard text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions another version which states \"at the beginning or the end of the line.\" That version parallels the apparent source for the halachah, <i>Menachot</i> 31b.2. This custom is also recorded by Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, and earlier, in the halachot of Rav Yehudai Gaon. It is not clear when this custom was begun.3. As mentioned in Halachah 2, a space is left at the beginning of the line so that the passage, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>, will be written in the <i>s'tumah</i> form.<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 5.6": ["When [a <i>mezuzah</i>] is folded - As the Rambam states, the intent is that the <i>mezuzah</i> be rolled.

As will be explained, there his interpretation is contested by other authorities. In this halachah, the Rambam describes the rulings which govern the situation when an effort has been made to rectify the situation by detaching the branches from their source of nurture. These are based on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 11a, and are also accepted by other Rabbinic authorities. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:2.)<br>", "If one draped the leaves and branches of trees [over the sukkah], and then placed s'chach over them, and only afterwards detached them - As mentioned in Halachot 1 and 2, branches are fit to be used for <i>s'chach</i> only after they have been detached from their source of nurture.<br>", "[the following rules apply:]<br>", "If the amount of [kosher] s'chach exceeded [the branches], it is kosher. - Though at present, the branches would be acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>, as explained in the commentary on Halachah 9, the Torah requires that when <i>s'chach</i> is originally put in place, it must be kosher. Otherwise, it is unacceptable even though steps were taken to correct the disqualifying factors. This is based on the principle that one must make a sukkah and not use one which is already made.<br>Nevertheless, since the prohibition against using these branches as <i>s'chach</i> does not relate to their essential nature, their presence may be nullified when there is a majority of kosher <i>s'chach</i>.

However, if there is a greater quantity of branches, the presence of the figs is nullified. In contrast, in this halachah, that concept is not applied.<br>Rav Avraham distinguishes between the two. In Halachah 3, the person does not intend to use the fruit for the purpose of shade; he merely wants to save the effort of removing it from the branches. Therefore, their presence may be nullified. In contrast, in this halachah the substances which are not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> are being employed for the purpose of shade itself. Hence, their presence cannot be nullified.<br>", "[the mixture] is not acceptable. - As mentioned above, this decision depends on the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 9b. That passage reads:A person who constructs his sukkah under a tree is considered as though he built it within his home...<br>Ravva said: \"The above applies only to a tree whose shade is greater than its open space. However, if its open space is greater than its shade, it is kosher.<br>What difference does it make if its open space is greater than its shade, the substance not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> will be combined with the kosher <i>s'chach</i> [and therefore, the sukkah will not be acceptable]?<br>Rav Pappa said: \u05d1\u05e9\u05d7\u05d1\u05d8\u05df.The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, the Ra'avad, and Rabbenu Manoach explain that the Rambam renders \u05d1\u05e9\u05d7\u05d1\u05d8\u05df as \"when he separated them.\" Thus, when the two substances were combined, the Rambam's opinion would be that the sukkah is not kosher, as explained in this clause of the halachah. When they are separate, the sukkah may be kosher according to the stipulations mentioned in the following clause of this halachah and the halachot to come.<br>(The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam renders \u05d1\u05e9\u05d7\u05d1\u05d8\u05df as \"when he severed them.\" However, that difference in interpretation does not result in a difference in halachah.)<br>Rashi and others interpret \u05d1\u05e9\u05d7\u05d1\u05d8\u05df as \"when he lowered them (and mixed them together with the kosher <i>s'chach</i>).\" Thus, according to this opinion, the sukkah is acceptable when the kosher and non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> are mixed together. Thus, this view is diametrically opposed to the Rambam's, who maintains that such a mixture is of no avail.<br>As noted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1), there are two ways of understanding this interpretation of the passage. However, since both of them are not acceptable to the Rambam, their explanation will not be included here.<br>", "If one covered the sukkah with the two substances and kept them separate - When there is a majority of kosher <i>s'chach</i>, it is judged to be an independent entity. When there is a sufficient amount of kosher <i>s'chach</i>, the sukkah is kosher unless the substance that is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> is placed in a manner which can disqualify the entire sukkah, as is explained in this and the following three halachot.<br>", "[the following rules apply:] If there are more than three handbreadths of the substance which is not acceptable as s'chach in one place - The principle of <i>l'vud</i>, by which this substance could be considered to be a continuation of the kosher <i>s'chach</i>, cannot apply. However, if there is less than three handbreadths of the substance that is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> in one place, even though there are a number of such patches among the <i>s'chach</i>, the sukkah is kosher, as stated in Halachah 16. Furthermore, one may eat and sleep under the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 632:1).<br>", "whether - the substance which is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> is placed...<br>", "in the middle of the sukkah or at its side, it is not acceptable. - As stated in the following halachot, this is relevant only with regard to a sukkah which possesses the minimum area. The reason the sukkah is not acceptable is not that it is disqualified by the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, but that it does not have the minimum amount of kosher <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Sukkah</i> 17b).<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.14": ["Where does the above apply?

In this instance, a substance that is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> was placed on the roof intentionally.<br>", "[In all these cases,] if there are four cubits [or more] from the edge of the kosher s'chach until the wall, it is not acceptable. If there is less than that amount, we view it as though the wall has been made crooked - i.e., the substance that is not acceptable as s'chach is considered part of the wall - Rabbenu Nissim states that this law applies only when the walls reach all the way to the <i>s'chach</i>. Otherwise, it is impossible to consider the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> to be an extension of the walls.

In contrast, a snack may be eaten outside a sukkah.)<br>", "under it in a sukkah. - for the same reasons mentioned above.<br>", "By the same token, if one sets up four pillars and spreads a sheet over them, if they are ten [handbreadths high], they are considered to be a sukkah within a sukkah. - Hence, we are forbidden to use the space below it as a sukkah.<br>This halachah depends on the Rambam's interpretation of the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:3. However, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 10b and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 627:3) interpret the passage differently and forbid spreading a canopy over bedposts which are permanently affixed to the four corners of a bed, even if the canopy is less than ten handbreadths above the ground.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.24": ["In contrast, should one spread a sheet over two pillars - <i>Tosafot</i> (ibid.) and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) differ with this decision as well, and explain that if these pillars are ten handbreadths high and permanently affixed to the bed, it is forbidden to spread a sheet over them.<br>", "or [use] a canopy that has a roof of less than a handbreadth - If the canopy is not permanently affixed to the bed, even <i>Tosafot</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> will permit its use.<br>", "no matter how high they are - i.e., even if they are more than ten handbreadths high.<br>", "it is permitted to sleep under them within a sukkah. - <i>Sukkah</i> 19a relates that Abbaye found Rav Yosef sleeping in a canopied bed in the sukkah. The latter explained that the canopy he was using was permitted because it did not have a roof.<br>", "They are not considered to be a sukkah within a sukkah, because they do not have a roof. - As stated in Chapter 4, Halachah 7, such structures are not acceptable for use as a sukkah. Hence, they also cannot disqualify a sukkah.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.25": ["A borrowed sukkah is fit [to be used on the holiday]. - Although, as stated in Chapter 8, Halachah 10, a person cannot fulfill the mitzvah of lulav as prescribed by the Torah with a lulav belonging to a colleague, that concept does not apply with regard to a sukkah.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 27b explains the derivation of this concept as follows: Leviticus 23:42 states: \"Every citizen of Israel shall dwell in sukkot.\" The latter word is written \u05e1\u05db\u05ea, implying one sukkah. This prompted our Sages to declare: \"All Israel are fit to dwell in a single sukkah.\"<br>In his commentary, Rashi explains that the cost of such a sukkah would not be high enough to require every individual to pay a penny's worth. Hence, we must assume that some people would be using a borrowed sukkah, and, nevertheless, our Sages said that it was kosher.<br>", "Similarly, a stolen sukkah is also fit [for use]. - There is a slight imprecision with the Rambam's statements. A stolen object which the thief is obligated to return cannot be used to perform a mitzvah, because it is considered a mitzvah that came about through a sin (\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4). However, in the instances cited by the Rambam, the sukkah itself is never considered stolen property. Hence, the use of such a sukkah is not forbidden. However, in a number of instances (see below), the sukkah itself is considered to be stolen property and must be returned. Hence, it cannot be used to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>", "What does the latter imply? If a person attacked a colleague, forced him to leave his sukkah, stole it, and dwelled in it, the attacker has fulfilled his obligation, because landed property cannot be stolen. - <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 8:14 relates that \"landed property is never acquired by a thief, but rather remains in the possession of its owner forever.\"<br>Since the sukkah is built on the land, it is considered part of the property and the above rule applies to it as well. Thus, the sukkah is still considered to be the property of its original owner and the thief is viewed as merely \"borrowing\" the sukkah from him. As mentioned above, use of a borrowed sukkah is permitted.<br>", "[Similarly,] if he stole wood and made a sukkah from it, he has fulfilled his obligation - <i>Sukkah</i> 31a relates that a woman once came to Rav Nachman complaining that the exilarch's servants had stolen wood from her to build his sukkah.<br>Rav Nachman answered that they had, nevertheless, fulfilled their obligation...<br>", "because the Sages ordained that the owner of the wood is entitled only to the monetary worth of the wood - but not the wood itself. Thus, the sukkah itself is the property of the thief. Though he is obligated to pay the owner for his wood, that obligation does not prevent the sukkah from being considered as his.<br><i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 1:5 explains this principle by stating:Anyone who steals is obligated to return the stolen property itself... If it was lost or changed, he is obligated to return its monetary value...<br>Even if one steals a beam and builds a mansion [using it], since [the beam] has not been changed, the Torah law would require him to destroy the entire building and return the beam to its owner.<br>Nevertheless, the Sages instituted a decree [to encourage] those who repent; they ordained that all that is necessary is for him to return [the beam's] monetary value, and thus he will not forfeit his building.Rabbenu Manoach asks: Since the mitzvah of sukkah is commanded by the Torah, and Torah law regards these boards as stolen, how can the Sages' decree change their status in this context?<br>He explains that, as implied by the principle \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e7\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d3\u05d9\u05df, the Torah has granted the Sages the right to determine the status of property. Their decree can alter entirely a person's rights to its title. Thus, in the present case, since Rabbinic law entitles the thief to use of the boards, he is permitted, according to Torah law, to use them as a Sukkah.<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (637:5) writes that if the thief refuses to pay for the wood, it is considered to be the property of its original owner, and the thief does not fulfill his obligation.<br>", "Even if one stole boards and merely put them in place without attaching them or changing anything about them, he has fulfilled his obligation. - This is a special leniency granted out of respect for the mitzvah of sukkah (<i>Sukkah</i>, ibid.). Since the thief has not made any changes in the wood itself or built a permanent structure from it, the Rabbinic decree mentioned above would not apply. Thus, during the rest of the year (and even in this case, after the Sukkot festival), the wood would have to be returned. During the festival, the Sages considered it to be the property of the thief and he is allowed to use without any constraints throughout the festival (<i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i>, ibid.).<br>Nevertheless, in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 637:3), Rav Yosef Karo gives two examples of a stolen sukkah which one is forbidden to use: a sukkah that had been constructed on a ship or one that had been constructed on a wagon. Since the thief did not build anything, the abovementioned Rabbinic decree does not apply; nor are they affixed to land, and hence the principle that landed property cannot be stolen is not relevant.<br>", "If a person constructs his sukkah in the public domain - Though the Jewish inhabitants of the city would surely not object to use of public property for this purpose, the gentile inhabitants of the city would. Since they also have a share in this property, building a sukkah there is equivalent to stealing from the public (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 637:3).<br>Nevertheless, since the theft of land is involved...<br>", "it is acceptable - for the reasons mentioned above.

If the favorable tidings are individual in nature, the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> should be recited. The Rambam mentions <i>hatov v\u2019hameitiv</i> in this halachah, because he is referring to - although not quoting exactly - the text of the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 9:2.<br>", "he should recite the blessing: \"Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who is good and does good.'' - As mentioned in Chapter 4, Halachah 9, this same blessing is also recited when different wine is served during a meal.<br>", "If he hears bad tidings, he should recite the blessing: \"Blessed [are You...] the true Judge.'' - This blessing has the implication that, although one personally feels upset over the event, he realizes that since everything is controlled by God and He is \"the true Judge\":<br>a) the occurrence, however tragic, was just,b) ultimately, it is intended for the good.

These five species are also mentioned in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:1.<br>", "wheat, barley - These grains, fundamental to day to day life in Western society, are among the seven species for which Deuteronomy 8:8 praises <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> for producing.<br>", "rye - This is the accepted translation. There is some difficulty, however, in accepting it, since rye was not commonly grown in the Mediterranean region. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Kilayim</i> 1:1, the Rambam defines \u05db\u05d5\u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05df as \"wild wheat.\"<br>", "oats - In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam describes oats as \"wild barley.\"<br>The term \u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05dc\u05ea \u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc, which literally means \"the kernels of the fox,\" is used because, unlike wheat and barley, oat kernels grow separate from the stalk of the grain, like a fox tail, which has hairs that stand out rather than lie flat.<br>", "and spelt. - In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions that this grain resembles \u05db\u05d5\u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05df. [For this reason, there are commentaries which interchange the translations of \u05db\u05d5\u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05df and \u05e9\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05df.]<br>", "Rye is a sub-species of wheat, and oats and spelt are sub- species of barley. - Although this statement has other implications (see Rashi, <i>Pesachim</i> 35a), the Rambam mentions it here to teach us that although Deuteronomy (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions only wheat and barley, since these other three grains are sub-species of them, they are governed by the same laws.<br>", "When these five species are in their stalks, they are referred to as tevuah. After they have been threshed and winnowed, they are referred to as grain. - Here, also, although these statements have other halachic implications (e.g., <i>Challah</i> 1:2 mentions these points within the context of vows: if a person vows not to benefit from <i>tevuah</i> or grain, he is forbidden to benefit from these species), the Rambam is defining these terms here because he will refer to them throughout this chapter.<br>", "When they have been milled and their flour kneaded and baked, they are referred to as bread - and require the ritual washing of hands and the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> beforehand and grace afterwards.<br>", "Bread made from these species is referred to as bread without any additional modifier. - If, however, bread is made from other grains - e.g., rice or corn - it is referred to as ricebread or cornbread.<br>"], "Blessings 3.2": ["Before eating bread - made from the five species of grain mentioned in the previous halachah<br>", "a person should recite the blessing, \"Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who brings forth bread from the earth.\" - <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 38b, notes that the conclusion of the blessing is taken from Psalms 104:14. Because of its importance as \"the staff of life,\" the Sages established a special blessing for bread in place of the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>.<br>", "Afterwards, he should recite the four blessings [of grace] - discussed in the previous chapter.<br>", "Before eating kernels of grain that have been cooked without being processed, - i.e., without removing the kernel's shell or crushing it. See Halachah 4.<br>Literally, the Rambam's words mean \"grain cooked as it is.\" The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this to mean \"as it comes from the silo.\"<br>", "a person should recite the blessing borey pri ha'adamah - the blessing recited for eating vegetables and other products of the earth (Chapter 8, Halachah 1).<br><i>Berachot</i> 37a states, \"A person who chews [kernels of] wheat should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>.\" Even though the grain has been cooked, since the kernels were not processed at all, it does not warrant a blessing of greater importance (<i>Kessef Mishnah</i>).<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:3-6 discusses the question of grains that are cooked whole, but are cooked for a long period until their shell dissolves. There are authorities who recommend that unless the kernels have been cooked to the extent that they stick together as a single mass, whole grains should be eaten only in the midst of a meal containing bread. See also Halachah 4.<br>", "Afterwards, he should recite the blessing borey nefashot rabbot. - The blessing usually recited after partaking of foods other than those from the seven species for which <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was praised. The same rationale mentioned above applies. Since the kernels were served without being processed, they do not warrant a blessing of greater importance.<br>", "Before eating flour - which has not been cooked<br>", "a person should recite the blessing shehakol. Afterwards, he should recite the blessing borey nefashot rabbot. - In this instance as well, the special blessings for grain products are not recited because the food was not prepared in the usual fashion. Furthermore, even the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> is not recited, because generally people do not eat flour (Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, See also <i>Berachot</i> 36a).1. I.e., it resembles a porridge.2. Because of the importance of the five species of grain, the Sages ordained the recitation of a special blessing before and after partaking of them. Since this mixture is considered a food and not a beverage, it warrants the recitation of these blessings.3. Since this mixture is considered a beverage and not a food, it does not warrant the recitation of these blessings. 4. <i>Berachot</i> 37b relates that any food that is made from the five species of grain but is not considered bread requires the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>. Since these foods are cooked in a pot, they are not considered bread. See also note 6.5. Since the grain kernels have been processed slightly, they are considered worthy of the special blessings ordained for foods from the five species. As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 2, the later authorities suggest that the grains be cooked to the point that they stick together as a single mass before these blessings should be recited. If, however, both the shell of the kernel has been removed and they have been crushed, the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> may be recited even when the kernels do not stick together (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:15).6. As mentioned in Halachah 6, as long as the grain is included to add flavor, it is considered the primary element in the mixture, and the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> should be recited, even though quantitatively, the dish contains a majority of other substances. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 208:2.) 7. The definition of foods as primary and secondary depends on the person's intention and not the quantity of the foods included in the mixture.8. This principle is quoted from the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7.9. Thus producing a single food, as exemplified in Halachah 6.10. In this instance, the two foods remain separate, yet the secondary food is included in the blessing recited over the primary one, as exemplified in Halachah 7. 11. The Rambam is quoting <i>Berachot</i> 39a, which states that this law applies even to turnips that require a large amount of flour.12. <i>Beitzah</i> 38a states, \"Anything added for flavor is never considered negligible.\"<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 204:25 and the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i> (Responsum 129) explain that the Rambam's (and the Talmud's) statements apply only to products from the five species of grain. Whenever they are added to flavor foods, they are considered of primary importance even when, quantitatively, they are less than the other ingredients of a particular dish. In contrast, when two or more types of foods other than grain products are mixed together in a single dish and both are intended to add flavor and/or satiate the person eating, the food which is greater in quantity is considered as the primary ingredient.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that if the starch was added for flavor, the mixture would require the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>. He continues, explaining that when other foods - e.g., fruits which are not usually eaten raw, are cooked in sugar to produce jam, the fruits are considered of primary importance. Hence, the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i> should be recited. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 204:11. 14. By adding the clause, \"so that the heavy brine...,\" the Rambam explains the source for this ruling, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7, and clarifies a problem posed by the commentaries.<br>Although the Mishnah mentions the example of bread serving as a secondary food when it accompanies salted foods, the Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 44a) protests, and explains that in almost all situations bread would be considered the primary food. The Mishnah is describing a specific instance: people who eat fruit that originates in the area around Lake Kineret.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that this refers to people who work as watchmen in orchards. They eat large quantities of fruit. Hence, in order to help their digestion, they also must partake of brine. Since the brine itself could be harmful, they eat bread with it.<br>Here, also, the Rambam is referring to a case where the person has no desire to eat bread and does so only to protect his throat. If, however, a person wanted to eat salted fish on bread and desired both the bread and the fish, he must recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> and recite grace. (See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 212:1-2.)<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 212:2 gives another example: A person who eats bread to weaken the taste of an alcoholic beverage. 16. A <i>k'zayit</i>. In contemporary measure, it is equivalent to 28.8 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 33 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.17. Out of faithfulness to the Rambam's text, we have translated his words literally, although they have caused the commentaries great difficulty. On the surface, there is an open contradiction between the first clause and the second clause. From the first clause, it appears that a piece of bread less than the size of an olive which resembles bread warrants the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. In contrast, the latter clause appears to indicate that the bread must both be the size of an olive and have the appearance of bread to warrant the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.<br>Because of this difficulty, the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1393) and <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> have suggested amending the text and rendering the latter clause, \"If they are not the size of an olive and no longer resemble bread because of the cooking process.\" Furthermore, even without amending the text, this interpretation can be accepted, since, as the Rambam's own descendant, Rabbi Yehoshua, explains, there are times when the Hebrew \u05d0\u05d5 can be rendered as \"if.\" Thus, the passage would read, \"If they are not the size of an olive, if....\"<br>Rav Yosef Karo was aware of the text's difficulty and the suggestions to amend it. Nevertheless, both in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:10), he seeks to justify the Rambam's choice of phraseology, explaining his statements as follows:<br>When one cooked pieces of bread or mixed them into soup, if they are the size of an olive, one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> although they no longer resemble bread. If they are less than the size of an olive but resemble bread, one should recite this blessing when they have been mixed into soup. If, however, they have been cooked, and although it is obvious that these pieces came from a loaf of bread, they no longer have the appearance of bread, only the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited.<br>To summarize: when one breaks bread into pieces and puts them into soup, since the pieces still resemble bread they may not be eaten unless one recites the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. If the pieces of bread were cooked completely to prepare a different food and less than a <i>k'zayit</i> remains whole, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited.

When the wood had burned until all that remained was glowing coals, they would remove them and fill the hole with dough. Afterwards, the coals would be placed above the dough and allowed to remain there until the dough was baked.

[He arrives at this calculation as follows: In the desert, the Jews received an <i>omer</i> of manna for two meals each day. An <i>omer</i> is twice the quantity of an <i>isaron</i>.] This is approximately 22 <i>k'beitzot</i>, or 1266 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 1452 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.

Hence, it was instituted only for breads that are usually served for such a purpose. If, however, a person decided to serve another food made from flour and resembling bread with a similar intent, it is also appropriate that he recite <i>hamotzi</i>.<br>", "Similar [laws apply to] dough that was kneaded with honey, oil, or milk - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:7) states that all that is necessary is to mix enough of these ingredients into the dough so that their taste is felt. The Ramah and the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 168:16 differ and maintain that the amount of these ingredients must exceed the quantity of water used. Support for their ruling can be drawn from the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:20.<br>The above is significant with regard to what is popularly called today <i>mezonot</i> bread, which is produced by using apple juice instead of (or together with) water. According to the Ramah, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should not be recited:a) if the dough is made with more water than juice, b) if one uses this bread as the basis for a large meal.<br>", "or mixed together with different condiments - sugar, honey, nuts, fruits, or spices<br>", "and baked - producing a product which, like cake, is generally eaten for pleasure and not as the basis of a meal.<br>", "It is referred to as pat haba'ah b'kisnin. - Note the<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:7), which offers two other interpretations of the term, <i>pat haba'ah b'kisnin</i>:a) Rabbenu Chananel's interpretation - dough filled with other sweet substances - e.g., pies that are served for dessert, like apple pie;b) Rav Hai Gaon's interpretation - crackers.<br>", "Although it [resembles] bread, the blessing borey minei mezonot is recited over it - because it is not food which, like bread, is the foundation of our diets.<br>", "If, however, one uses it as the basis of a meal - eating the quantity mentioned above of this grain product either alone or together with other foods (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 168:13)<br>", "one should recite the blessing hamotzi. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that all three opinions may be accepted as halachah, and none of these three types of foods requires the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> or grace, unless it is eaten as the basis of a meal.<br>There are, however, several difficulties with the application of this decision in contemporary situations, particularly with regard to \"<i>mezonot</i> bread.\" Surely, when one eats a complete meal, serving such bread does not free one of the obligation of washing and reciting grace. Furthermore, there are difficulties even when one eats only a snack with such bread. First, some authorities - e.g., Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi in his <i>Piskei Siddur</i> - state that a meticulous person should not each such bread without having recited <i>hamotzi</i> on other bread first.<br>Second, when one eats sandwiches using such bread or eats it with other foods, one may easily eat more than four <i>k'beitzot</i> of food, and that, as explained above, is problematic according to certain authorities.<br>"], "Blessings 3.10": ["Before eating rice - In this halachah, we have translated \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d6 as \"rice\" and \u05d3\u05d5\u05d7\u05df as \"millet,\" based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shvi'it</i> 2:7. There is, however, debate concerning this manner among the halachic authorities. Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 37a) and the Maharil interpret \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d6 as \"millet.\" With respect to these opinions, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 208:9 and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 208:11 suggest partaking of rice or millet only in the midst of a meal including bread. If either are eaten separately, the blessing <i>shehakol</i> should be recited beforehand because of the doubt involved.<br>In contrast, the <i>Sha'ar Tziyun</i> 208:31 rules that the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited before partaking of rice. He explains that there are opinions that the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited on all satisfying food. Since rice serves this purpose, it can be given this blessing.<br>", "that has been cooked - after its shell has been removed and it has been crushed<br>", "or bread made from rice - In contrast, before eating kernels of rice, one should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> as is done before partaking of kernels of grain. (See Halachah 2 and <i>Berachot</i> 37a.)<br>", "one should recite the blessing borey minei mezonot. - The latter phrase praises God as \"the Creator of satisfying food.\" Since rice falls into this category, <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, decided that it should be given this blessing.<br>", "Afterwards, the blessing borey nefashot should be recited. - Although rice is a satisfying food, it is not one of the five species of grain. Hence, neither grace nor <i>al hamichyah</i> is recited after partaking of it. See also the following halachah.<br>", "This applies only when no other ingredients are combined together with the rice. - Thus, the law regarding rice differs from that regarding cooked foods made from the five grains. As explained in Halachot 4-6, although quantitatively a food may contain a mixture of other ingredients, as long as the grain was intended to add flavor to the food, it is considered the primary ingredient. In contrast, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> is recited on a mixture of rice and other foods only when rice is quantitatively the primary element of the mixture. See <i>Shulchan Aruch (</i>14Orach Chayim13 208:7).<br>The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 208:9, however, maintains that the Rambam's words should be interpreted literally. Thus, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited only when rice is prepared by itself and not when eaten in combination with even a minority of other foods.<br>", "In contrast, before eating bread made from millet - Rabbenu Asher and many other Ashkenazic authorities differ with the Rambam and maintain that since millet, like rice, is a sustaining food, it warrants the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>. Nevertheless, the<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:8) and the later authorities follow the Rambam's opinion. Note, however, the difference of opinion on the definition of the terms \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d6 and \u05d3\u05d5\u05d7\u05df mentioned above.<br>", "or other species of kitniyot - <i>Kitniyot</i> is generally translated as \"legumes.\" In halachic literature, however, it is used to refer to a far wider scope of agricultural products, particularly with regard to the laws of Pesach.

For example, corn is referred to as <i>kitniyot</i>.<br>", "one should recite the blessing shehakol. - Although all<i>kitniyot</i> grow from the ground, the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> is recited only when one eats them cooked as vegetables, and not when they have been ground into flour and baked into other foods, since this is not the normal manner in which they are eaten (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 208:12).<br>", "Afterwards, the blessing borey nefashot should be recited - as is proper after partaking of all foods of this type.<br>"], "Blessings 3.11": ["Whenever the blessing hamotzi is recited before [partaking of a food] - i.e., when one eats bread or enough of other grain substances to warrant the recitation of <i>hamotzi</i>, as mentioned in Halachah 9.<br>", "the four blessings of grace are recited afterwards in their proper order.<br>Whenever the blessing borey minei mezonot is recited before [partaking of a food] - i.e, the foods made from the five species of grain that are mentioned in Halachot 3, 4, 8, and 9.<br>", "a single blessing, which includes the three [blessings of grace], is recited afterward - This blessing contains the three primary elements of the first three blessings of grace, an expression of thanks to God for granting us sustenance, for granting us <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and for granting us Jerusalem.

Both emphasize how God is above nature and, hence, can change nature according to His will.<br>This quality is also reflected in our service.

Customarily, we follow both opinions in our recitation of the Haggadah (Rav Yitzchak Alfasi), and hence the Rambam includes both opinions in this halachah.<br>There is, nonetheless, a certain difficulty with the Rambam's statements. All texts of the Haggadah begin with \"We were slaves,\" and then relate the passage \"Originally, our ancestors were idol worshipers.\" Here, the Rambam reverses that order.

However, the prevailing opinion (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 472:19) is that for the first three cups, it is sufficient to drink the majority of a quarter of a <i>log</i> (i.e., at least 1.68 fluid ounces of wine). For the final cup, one should drink an entire quarter of a <i>log</i>.<br>The source of the latter law is <i>Pesachim</i> 108a, which mentions a person who drinks wine from his cup and then gives to his children and the members of his household. The Talmud concludes that he fulfills his obligation if he drinks the majority of the cup.

However, the question can be raised: why does the Rambam not require a blessing to be recited over the <i>charoset</i>? Among the answers given is that the <i>charoset</i> is considered secondary (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc) to the substances which are dipped in it.

Furthermore, its Aramaic name, \u05d7\u05e1\u05d0, also means compassion and alludes to God's mercy for our people.

To explain: Following the verse quoted here by the Rambam as a proof-text, the Torah continues [Numbers 10:10]: \"On the days of your rejoicing, on your festivals, and on your new moon [celebrations], you shall sound the trumpets for your burnt offerings and for your peace offerings.\"<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:We are commanded to sound the trumpets in the Temple when offering sacrifices that are offered only at appointed times.... [Also,] we are commanded to sound the trumpets at a time of distress and difficulty when we pray to Him.In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (and similarly in <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, Mitzvah 384), the emphasis of the mitzvah is clearly on the sounding of the trumpets during the sacrifices. In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, when listing the 613 mitzvot at the beginning of the text, the Rambam mentions the sounding of the trumpets both for the sacrifices and in times of distress. Nevertheless, further on in the beginning of the text, when delineating the mitzvot according to subjects, he places the emphasis on crying out to God at a time of distress (seemingly, including crying out verbally and crying out with the trumpets in the same mitzvah). Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i>, Chapter 3, where the Rambam mentions the practice of sounding the trumpets in connection with the offering of the sacrifices, he does not mention it as a component of this or any other specific mitzvah.<br>(Note also the commentary of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, which questions why these two different rites were included as a single mitzvah at the outset. Even in the Torah, they are included in two separate verses.)<br>", "to cry out - in prayer. Our Sages (<i>Sifre, VaEtchanan</i>) explain that \u05d6\u05e2\u05e7\u05d4 is one of the ten verbs used for prayer.<br>", "and to sound - The verb \u05dc\u05d4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e2 refers to the sounding of a series of staccato notes referred to as <i>teru'ah</i>. See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:2-4. Significantly, although in practice, both types of notes were sounded, with regard to the sounding of the trumpets at the offerings, the Torah uses the verb \u05d5\u05ea\u05e7\u05e2\u05ea\u05dd, which refers to sounding a <i>teki'ah</i>, a single long note.<br>", "trumpets - In the Temple, these were made of silver (<i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 3:5). Josephus describes them as being approximately a cubit long, slightly thicker than an ordinary flute, and having a bell-like end. It is questionable whether it was necessary for them to be silver outside the Temple as well.<br>See also the Ramban (<i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i>), who mentions an opinion that the shofar, and not a trumpet, should be sounded in time of communal distress. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also notes this opinion and states that either instrument, a shofar or a trumpet, is acceptable, but that - outside of the Temple premises - only one of the two should be used in time of distress. Some support for this position can be drawn from Halachah 6.<br>", "in the event of any difficulty that arises which affects the community, as [Numbers 10:9] states: \"[When you go out to war...] against an enemy who attacks you and you sound the trumpets....\" - As obvious from Halachah 4, this practice was observed throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and not only in the Temple. Nor is its observance dependent on the existence of the Temple, nor does the Rambam specify that it must be fulfilled only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (In this regard, there are differing opinions; see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:1) Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:1 questions: Why is the rite of sounding the trumpets (or shofarot) not observed at present?<br>The resolution of this question lies in the Rambam's words, \"any difficulty that arises which affects the community.\" This rite should not be observed when an individual, or even a group of individuals, are in distress, but only when a \"community\" is affected.<br><i>Pesachim</i> 54b explains that communal fasts are possible only within <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There is no concept of taking such a unified communal act of this nature in the diaspora. Therefore, this mitzvah was not relevant in all the generations of our people's existence in the diaspora. (See also the <i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i> of the Ramban.)<br>A question arises, however, with regard to the situation at present, with the renewal of the Jewish settlement in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 11, there are opinions (see the gloss of the <i>Birkei Yosef</i> to the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575) that maintain that at present, the concept of community also applies in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>According to this view, without entering into the discussion regarding the halachic status of the present government, it would appear that it would be proper for this mitzvah to be observed, since its observance is not dependent on the Temple.<br>", "[This commandment is not restricted to such a limited scope - i.e., it does not apply to war alone, as might be understood from the verse.<br>", "rather] the intent is: Whenever you are distressed by difficulties - e.g., famine, plague - Note <i>Ta'anit</i> 22b, which states that the trumpets should not be sounded in the case of a plague even during the week. Since a plague is a very severe matter, were the trumpets to be sounded during the week, they might also be sounded when a plague took place on the Sabbath, and thus a prohibition would be violated. The Rambam discusses this question in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:3). Similarly, in Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Rambam rules that the trumpets are sounded when a plague occurs.<br>", "locusts, or the like - i.e., circumstances that cause distress to the community as a whole.<br>", "cry out [to God] because of them and sound the trumpets. - See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 2:6, where the Rambam gives the assurance that if the Jews cry out to God as a community, He will surely heed their prayers.<br>"], "Fasts 1.2": ["This practice is one of the paths of repentance - Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Temurah</i>, where the Rambam writes that although all the mitzvot of the Torah are Divine decrees and thus unfathomable in nature, we should meditate upon them and, to the fullest extent of our potential, try to explain them. Similarly, with regard to the mitzvah under discussion, without claiming to be able to fathom it in its entirety, the Rambam gives a rational explanation for the practice.<br>", "for when a difficulty arises, and the people cry out [to God] and sound the trumpets, everyone will realize - The very sound of the trumpets will have a startling effect, arousing the people to inspect their conduct. Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:4, the Rambam writes:Although the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah is a mitzvah, it also contains an allusion. [It is as if the shofar is saying,] \"Wake up you sleepy ones.... You who forget the truth in the vanities of time... look to your souls and improve your conduct.\"", "that [the difficulty] occurred because of their evil conduct, as [Jeremiah 5:25] states: \"Your sins have turned away [the rains and the harvest climate].\" - See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 9:1, where the Rambam explains that God has instituted a cycle of causation into the world in which performing a mitzvah brings an individual - or a community - blessing and prosperity, which enable them to perform more mitzvot. Conversely, the failure to observe mitzvot brings about misfortune, which, in turn, makes it even harder to observe mitzvot.<br>", "This [realization] will cause the removal of this difficulty. - For when the Jews turn to God in repentance, He will remove their hardships.<br>"], "Fasts 1.3": ["Conversely, should the people fail to cry out [to God] and sound the trumpets, and instead say, \"What happened to us is merely a natural phenomenon and this difficulty is merely a chance occurence\" - Rather than seeing their difficulty as part of a Divinely structured plan to motivate their repentance.<br>", "this is a cruel conception of things - Misfortune is definitely not pleasant. Nevertheless, when one conceives of it as a message from God, intended to motivate a change in one's conduct, one can appreciate that, ultimately, its intent is mercy. In contrast, when one does not appreciate God's hand, one is left with a conception of an existential and cruel world in which there is no force working for man's benefit.<br>", "which causes them to remain attached to their wicked deeds - for they refuse to pay attention to the external cues God gives to motivate repentance.<br>", "Thus, this time of distress will lead to further distresses. - Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Tum'at Tzara'at</i>, where the Rambam explains that when a person remains indifferent to the punishment God gives him, God brings more severe punishment upon him.<br>", "This is implied by the Torah's statement [Leviticus 26:27-28]: \"If you remain indifferent to Me, I will be indifferent to you with a vengeance.\" - \u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d4, the Hebrew for \"chance occurrence,\" shares the same root as \u05e7\u05e8\u05d9, \"indifferent.\" Thus<br>", "The implication of the verse is: When I bring difficulties upon you so that you shall repent and you say it is a chance occurence, I will add to your [punishment] an expression of vengeance for that indifference [to Divine Providence].<br>"], "Fasts 1.4": ["In addition - to the obligation to cry out and sound the trumpets incumbent upon us from the Torah<br>", "it is a Rabbinic ordinance to fast - The <i>Or Sameach</i> mentions that this practice has its source in Biblical times.

Instead, we are obligated to continue fasting until God shows us His mercies and eliminates the source of distress.<br><i>Ta'anit</i> 14b quotes a Rabbinic opinion that maintains that no more than thirteen communal fasts should be ordained because of a difficulty. The Talmud, however, explains that this statement was made with regard to drought alone. With regard to other difficulties, we should continue to fast until our prayers are answered. This conclusion is alluded to by the Rambam's choice of wording in Chapter 3, Halachah 9, and is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:6).<br>", "On these fast days, we cry out in prayer, offer supplications, and sound the trumpets - blow a series of <i>teru'ah</i> notes<br>", "only. - I.e., with no other instrument to accompany them.<br>", "In the Temple, we sound both the trumpets and the shofar. - From the Mishnah (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 3:3), it would appear that two shofarot were sounded together (<i>Minchat Chinuch</i>).<br>", "The shofar blasts should be shortened and the trumpet blasts extended - I.e., the trumpet blasts should continue even after the shofar blasts have ceased.<br>", "for the mitzvah of the day is with the trumpets. - Note the contrast to <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 1:2.<br>", "The trumpets are sounded together with the shofar only in the Temple, as [can be inferred from Psalms 98:6]: \"Sound trumpets and shofar blasts before God, the King.\" - I.e., only \"before God,\" in the Temple, where His Presence is manifest, should these two instruments be sounded together, not elsewhere.<br>"], "Fasts 1.5": ["These fasts ordained for the community because of difficulties should not be consecutive - day after day.<br>", "for - even though it would be permitted to eat at night<br>", "the community would not be able to observe such a practice. - And an ordinance for the community is not instituted unless it is possible for the majority of the community to observe it (<i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 2:5). Were a communal ordinance that could not be observed by the majority of the community to be instituted, the people's observance, not only of that particular ordinance, but of the Torah as a whole, would be weakened.<br>", "A communal fast should be ordained only on a Monday - See the commentary on the following halachah, which deals with the question of communal fasts being instituted on days other than Monday or Thursday.<br>", "on the subsequent Thursday, and on the subsequent Monday. - Mondays and Thursdays are days associated with significant spiritual influences. Also, in this manner, the fasts are separated from each other and from the Sabbath.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:9), the Rambam explains that communal fasts should be held first on Mondays, because were they to be held on Thursday, the shopkeepers would assume that the possibilities for famine are great - for otherwise why would a public fast be instituted before the Sabbath - and they would raise the prices of foodstuffs.<br>(This rationale differs slightly from Rashi's interpretation of the Mishnah. Significantly, many of the traditional commentaries on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> do not mention the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah. See the <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>.)<br>", "This pattern - Monday, Thursday, Monday - should be followed until [God manifests His] mercies. - From the wording of this halachah, it would appear that the second Thursday should be skipped, and the second series of three fasts begun on the third Monday. The commentaries note that although there is justification for this position in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:13), the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 15b) rules that there is no need to interrupt the sequence of fasts on the second Thursday. This ruling is also borne out by the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and some authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. There are, however, other Rabbinic opinions - which are also supported by different manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (see the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 3) - that maintain that a series of communal fasts should always begin on a Monday.<br>"], "Fasts 1.6": ["A communal fast should not be decreed on a Sabbath, nor on a festival - for the reasons mentioned above.<br>The <i>Merchevat HaMishneh HaSefaradit</i> raises a question regarding this statement. From the previous halachah, it would appear that a communal fast is ordained only on Mondays and Thursdays, and from this halachah one might assume that, since it is necessary to exclude the Sabbath, such a fast might be ordained for other days.<br>In resolution, it is explained that the previous halachah refers only to the thirteen communal fasts instituted when the rains fail to descend. When a difficulty of another nature arises, a fast may be instituted on a day other than Monday or Thursday. Alternatively, it can be explained that if the difficulty is not a matter of immediate emergency, the fast is put off for a Monday, as mentioned above. In the case of an immediate emergency, however, a fast may be held on any day other than those mentioned in this and the following halachah.<br>", "On these days, neither a shofar nor a trumpet should be sounded, nor do we cry out [to God] or offer supplications in prayer. - Because of the atmosphere of rest and pleasure that permeates the Sabbath, it is improper to make requests about matters that are not immediate necessities. See <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:12<br>", "The [only] exceptions are - See also Chapter 2, Halachah 2, which states that we should cry out in prayer, even on the Sabbath, if our source of sustenance is threatened.<br>", "a city surrounded by gentiles or a [flooding] river and a ship that is sinking at sea. - for these are situations where human life is in immediate danger.<br>", "[In these instances, and indeed,] even when a single individual is being pursued by gentiles, by thieves, or by an evil spirit - i.e., he loses control of his behavior and may harm himself (Rashi, <i>Ta'anit</i> 22b)<br>", "(we may fast because of them on the Sabbath) - This phrase is set off by parentheses in most contemporary editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, because it is not included in the quotation of this halachah in the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 576). In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo brings support for the omission of this phrase, noting that in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 2:24 and 30:12, where the Rambam discusses praying to God in the event of such imminent disasters on the Sabbath, he does not mention fasting. Hence, when mentioning appealing to God with regard to these difficulties on the Sabbath in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (288:9, 576:12), Rav Yosef Karo omits the mention of fasting.<br>", "cry out [to God], and offer supplications on their behalf in prayer. - <i>Ta'anit</i> 14a states that this refers to the addition of the prayer <i>Anenu</i>. According to the authorities who maintain that we may fast on the Sabbath (and even according to some who forbid fasting), this refers to the blessing <i>Anenu</i> added to the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>). According to the other opinions, it refers to the seven blessings mentioned in Chapter 4 that begin \"May He who answered... answer you\" (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>", "[The trumpets] should not be sounded - Sounding a trumpet is not one of the forbidden Sabbath labors; it is, nevertheless, forbidden because of a Rabbinical decree (see <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:7).<br>", "for them - as an expression of prayer to arouse God's mercies.<br>", "however, unless they are being sounded to gather together the people to help them and [try to] save them. - I.e., they may be sounded as an alarm to call people to come to their assistance, for the Sabbath laws may be violated for the sake of saving lives (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>Note Chapter 2, Halachah 14, which states that if a community's source of sustenance is threatened \u05de\u05ea\u05e8\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd (the verb that generally means \"we sound the trumpets\") on the Sabbath.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 572:2) quotes the Rambam's ruling.<br>", "If, however, the community has begun to fast because of a distressing situation for even a single day, and the schedule of fasts requires that a fast be held on one of the days mentioned above, we should fast, and [indeed,] fast for the entire day. - Although the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>) states that the fast should be interrupted before nightfall because of the positive nature of these days, <i>Ta'anit</i> 18b quotes a majority opinion that maintains that the fast should be completed.<br>"], "Fasts 1.8": ["Pregnant women, nursing women - lest their fetus or child be endangered by the lack of nourishment.<br>", "and children - The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:10 questions the mention of children in this halachah, for it is accepted that children are never obligated to fast. He explains that, in this instance, the term refers to children past the age of majority. Males are not obligated to observe fasts of this nature until they are 18, nor females until they are 15.<br>The <i>B'nei Binyamin</i> offers another explanation, noting that on Yom Kippur children should be trained to fast by withholding food from them for several hours (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:10). This practice need not be observed on these fast days.<br>", "need not fast - Nevertheless, as mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, they should not indulge in food and drink for the sake of pleasure.<br>", "on communal fasts that are instituted because of difficulties of this nature. - In contrast, these women are required to fast on the seven fasts observed for a lack of rain (<i>ibid.</i>).<br>", "[With regard to these fasts,] even though we are required to fast during the day, we are allowed to eat on [the preceding] night, with the exception of the fasts instituted for [a lack of] rain, as will be explained - in Chapter 3, Halachot 3 and 5.<br>", "Whenever we are allowed to eat on the night of a fast, whether a communal fast or an individual fast, a person is allowed to eat until dawn, provided he does not sleep.

If one merely dozes off briefly, one may eat.<br>", "he may not eat after arising - even if he wakes up before dawn.<br>The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 564:1) state that if, before going to sleep, a person stipulates that he desires to rise before dawn and eat, he is allowed to eat, and yet his fast is still considered to be a fast.<br>"], "Fasts 1.9": ["Just as the community should fast because of distress, so too, each individual should fast [when confronted by] distress. - The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this as an obligation.

Surely, one should fast for one's own sake if that is possible. In many situations, however, were a person who confronts distress to fast, he would lack the strength to cope with the crisis he is facing. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 571:3.)<br>Nevertheless, <i>Ta'anit</i> 8b gives advice regarding such a situation as well, counselling one to vow to fast in the future. This will be considered as if the person fasted already, as implied by Daniel 10:12, \"From the day on which you first <i>considered</i>... fasting before your Lord, your words were heeded.\"<br>", "ask for mercy for him in prayer, and say [the passage] Anenu - See <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 2:14.<br>", "in - the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i> in<br>", "all the Shemoneh Esreh prayers recited [that day].<br>", "One should not fast on the Sabbath, on festivals, on Rosh Chodesh, on Chanukah, or on Purim. - The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this as a prohibition. Although a community may observe a fast on some of these days, as stated in Halachah 7, an individual may not. (See also Halachah 12.)<br>Note the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, which raises questions about this decision, citing <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 3:9, where the Rambam states:If a person vowed to fast for several days, and those days included Chanukah and Purim, his vow is nullified and he should not fast. [The celebration of] these days was instituted by the Rabbis, and hence, it should be reinforced.One might infer that on the other days that should be celebrated because of the Torah's decree, a vow to fast takes precedence. Some commentaries, however, differentiate between a vow to fast and a commitment to fast made in the afternoon service of the preceding day, as mentioned in the following halachah. In practice, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 578:1) rules that one should not fast on these days.<br>"], "Fasts 1.10": ["Whenever an individual did not accept a fast [on the previous day] before sunset, it is not considered to be a fast. - <i>Ta'anit</i> 12a describes a person who fasts without having made such a commitment to be \"a bellows full of air\" - i.e., he receives no reward for refraining from eating. Note the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, who questions why such a person does not receive at least the reward of an hourly fast, as mentioned in Halachah 13.<br>He explains that since the person desired his fast to be considered as a full day fast, it is impossible for him to receive the merit of an hourly fast. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 562:42.)<br>", "How does one accept a fast? After reciting the afternoon prayers - i.e., after reciting the verse, <i>Yih'yu l'ratzon</i>, but before concluding one's prayers entirely.<br>Significantly, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that some texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state that one should make this commitment in the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i>, reciting the prayer <i>Anenu</i>. Although the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others take issue with this concept, its authenticity is borne out by two responsa ascribed to the Rambam.<br>In practice, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 562:6 mentions both possibilities, while the Ramah states that it is preferable to make this statement after the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Interestingly, the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:2 fuses together both options, stating that one should make a mental resolve while reciting the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i>, and a verbal statement after reciting the verse, <i>Yih'yu l'ratzon</i>.<br>", "one states, \"Tomorrow I will fast,\" and resolves to do so. - From the Rambam's statements, it appears that a mental resolve is not sufficient. This is borne out by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 563:1). Note the ruling of the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 563:3, which state that, after the fact, it is sufficient to have made a mental resolve for one's commitment to fast to be binding.<br>", "Although one eats at night, this does not detract from one's commitment to fast. - In contrast to what might be inferred from the Rambam's statements and the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) also mention that, after the fact, it is not necessary for the commitment to be made in the afternoon service. As long as it was made during the previous day, whether before the service (according to the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> only) or afterwards (according to both sources), it is binding.<br>", "Similarly, if one resolved to fast for three or four days consecutively and accepts such a fast upon oneself, the fact that one eats each night does not detract from his fast - provided that in the daylight hours one refrains from eating.<br>", "It is unnecessary for him to state his intent on the afternoon before each succeeding day. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:8) questions whether this applies only when one intends to fast on several consecutive days. If, however, one intends to fast on several non-consecutive days - e.g., on a Monday, on the following Thursday, and on the following Monday - perhaps one is required to make a separate commitment for each day.<br>With regard to the fasts of <i>B'hav</i> (the Monday-Thursday-Monday sequence of fasts which follow the festivals), the authorities agree that a single statement of intent is sufficient. In other instances, however, the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:1 and others require a separate commitment.<br>The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:3 mentions another leniency in this instance.

It is fasting and not indulgence that will bring such a person satisfaction.<br>Note that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 288:5) explains that at present, it is customary to fast on the Sabbath only for certain disturbing dreams, since we are not as aware of the proper interpretation of dreams as were the Sages of the previous generations.<br>", "reciting the passage Anenu in each of the prayer services. - During the week, this passage should be recited in the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i> as usual.

The others maintain that it should be rendered \"provided he has not eaten anything the entire day.\" Based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nedarim</i> 8:1), the Rambam maintains that even if a person has eaten, if he does not eat for the remainder of the day, he receives merit for fasting.<br>", "What is implied?

In his responsa (Vol. I, Responsum 6), the Rashba writes that the Rambam altered his opinion in his later years and accepted the majority view. The majority opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:10).<br>Significantly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also mentions a more stringent view (that of Rabbenu Asher). According to this opinion, even an hourly fast has to be accepted on the previous day. Thus, an hourly fast refers to an instance when a person previously made a commitment to fast for half a day, and then decided to extend the fast for the entire day.<br>It must be noted that at present, when individuals find fasting difficult, it is customary for a community to declare an hourly fast. In these instances, the members of the community make a commitment not to eat until the afternoon. They recite the afternoon service early, and each individual recites <i>Anenu</i> (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 562:6).

The Great <i>Hallel</i>, in contrast, refers to Psalm 136 (<i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 8:10).<br><i>Pesachim</i> 118a explains that this psalm is given this title because it contains the verse, \"He grants bread to all flesh, His kindnesses are everlasting.\" This is the greatest praise of God, that although He utterly transcends our world, He provides each creation with its needs.<br>", "for the Great Hallel is recited only when one's spirit is satisfied and one's belly is full. - Hence, we do not recite these verses of praise until we have eaten.<br>", "If [the rains descended] after noon, since the majority of the day had passed in holiness - i.e., in separation from material concerns<br>", "they should complete their fast. - From this explicit teaching regarding rain, the Rambam infers that<br>", "Similar [rules apply] if [a community] - in contrast to an individual, as mentioned in the previous halachah<br>", "was fasting because of a distressing situation, and the distress passed, or because of a harsh decree and the decree was nullified: - The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 569:5 quotes a difference of opinion among the Rabbis whether the leniency to be mentioned applies if the prayers of the community were not answered, but the reason for which they are fasting ceases to become relevant. For example, the people were fasting for the recovery of a sick person and he died.<br>", "[If this occurred] before noon, they need not complete their fast; - The Ra'avad objects to this decision, explaining that the leniency of stopping a communal fast applies only with regard to the fasts associated with rain. In other instances, it is impossible to be certain that the distressing situation has entirely passed before noon.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that although the Ra'avad's rationale is generally applicable, if - in fact - the distressing situation passes before noon, the fast may be halted.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also states two reasons for the difference between an individual fast and a communal fast:<br>a) Leniency was granted to the community because of the greater scale of the difficulty involved in such a fast;<br>b) When the court called the communal fast, it had in mind that were the community's prayers to be answered, the fast could be terminated.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 569:1) rules that if the Torah scholars and the majority of the members of the community desire to continue the fast, all the members of the community are obligated to abide by their decision.<br>", "after noon, they should complete their fast. - There are opinions which rule that if the community receives word after noon that the difficulty for which they are fasting was averted before noon, they need not continue their fast.<br>"], "Sabbath 9.4": ["When one person brought fire, another brought wood - The Rambam's ruling is based on <i>Beitzah</i> 34a and the <i>Tosefta, Shabbat</i> 12:4. There are, however, slight differences between the wording chosen by the Rambam and the wording of those sources. Furthermore, the Talmud implies that the person who brought the fire is liable, not for performing a derivative of the labor of cooking, but for the labor of kindling. (See Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>) This is definitely not the Rambam's intent.<br>In resolution of this difficulty, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes his teacher, Rav Ya'akov bei Rav, who explains that the first clause describes a situation in which all the individuals performed their act virtually simultaneously, with a shared intent. Hence, since the end result of their activity is the performance of a forbidden labor, all are held liable as if they had performed the labor themselves.<br>", "another brought the pot - As the Ra'avad mentions, <i>Beitzah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as referring to a situation where a new pot is used. Thus, heating the pot hardens it as would heating in a kiln. This is is also a derivative of the labor of cooking. (See Halachah 6 and <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 3:11.)<br>According to the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentioned above, this is unnecessary. Since the pot was brought together with the other elements for the sake of cooking, the person bringing it is liable, even if it is an old pot.<br>", "another added water - Even those who do not accept the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> would hold such a person liable, since a person is liable for heating water, as explained in Halachah 1.<br>", "another put in meat - Here too, the obligation is clear, for the person is cooking food.<br>", "another put in spices - Since the spices contribute flavor to the food, adding them to the pot is sufficient to make one liable for cooking, even according to the opinions that do not accept the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.<br>", "and another stirred it - for stirring hastens the cooking process. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 318:18) emphasizes that one is liable for stirring only when the food is not completely cooked. Once it is cooked, there is no prohibition against stirring.<br>The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that even after food is completely cooked, one should not stir it. The later authorities emphasize that although there is reason to follow this stringency with regard to stirring, there is no difficulty in removing food from the pot if it is already cooked and removed from the fire. (While the pot is cooking this is forbidden, for in the process of taking out the food, one will stir the remaining food.) See Chapter 3, Halachah 11.<br>", "all are liable for cooking, since anyone who performs an activity that is necessary for cooking is considered as [having performed that forbidden labor].<br>If, by contrast, one put down the pot, another came - According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this is the key phrase in understanding the difference between the first clause and the second. \"Another came\" - i.e., he came after, and without any connection, to the first individual. Hence, the responsibility is not shared by the entire group. Accordingly, since the actions of the persons mentioned first could not bring about cooking in their own right, they are not held liable.<br>", "and added water, another came and added meat, another came and added spices, another came and brought fire - The person bringing the fire would probably be liable for kindling, but that is not the Rambam's concern in this halachah. He is not liable for cooking, for without the wood the flame would burn out in the near future.<br>", "another came and placed wood on the fire - Once the wood begins to burn, the fire will have the potential to cook the meat. Hence, the person who brings it is liable.<br>", "and another came and stirred - Since the person stirred the food after it began to cook, he is liable. Although he acted independently of the others, the act he performs in its own right is sufficient to incur liability.<br>", "it is only the latter two who are liable for cooking.<br>"], "Blessings 2.1": ["This is the order of the blessings of the grace after meals: The first blessing [thanks God for providing our] sustenance; - Deuteronomy 8:10 states: \"When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless God, your Lord....\" <i>Berachot</i> 48b states that this command obligates us to recite the blessing thanking God for our sustenance.<br>", "The second blessing [thanks God for granting us] Eretz [Yisrael]; - The above verse continues, \"for the good land which He has granted you.\" <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as an obligation to add a special blessing thanking God for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>", "The third blessing [praises God as] \"the builder of Jerusalem\"; - <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets the modifier \"good\" in the above verse as a reference to Jerusalem and the Temple.

He instituted the blessing thanking God, \"for Israel, Your people, and Jerusalem, Your city\" (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>", "and his son, Solomon - who built the Temple and added to the blessing instituted by his father, acknowledgement of \"the great and holy house on which Your name is called\" (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>There is a slight difficulty with these statements. The first three blessings are considered to have been instituted by the Torah. If so, how can the authorship of the latter two of them be attributed to Joshua, David, and Solomon, who lived in later generations?<br>The Ramban in his <i>Hasagot</i> explains that, although the fundamental obligation to recite these blessings originates in the Torah, the basic form of the text of these blessings was ordained by each of these prophets in his time. Beforehand, each person would recite the grace in his own words. (See also the commentary on the following halachah.)<br>The Ramban also explains that, after the destruction of the Temple, a prayer that it be rebuilt was included in the third blessing. In this context, it is also worthy to question whether Ezra and the Men of the Great Assembly also made any changes in the grace when they arranged all the prayers and blessings, as mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 5 and commentary. (See <i>Kochba d'Shavit</i>.)<br>", "and the fourth by the Sages of the <i>Megillah</i>. - <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates that the Sages instituted this blessing on the day the Romans granted permission for the dead of Beitar to be buried. This city had served as the capital of Bar Kochba's revolt against Rome and had exacted a heavy toll of legionnaires while making a valiant defense. When the city finally fell, the Romans slew hundreds of thousands mercilessly, the extent of the carnage staggering all chroniclers. As a further measure of punishment to its inhabitants, they refused to allow them to be buried.<br>Years passed before such permission was granted. When the Romans finally granted the Sages permission to bury these people, they were amazed at the wondrous miracle their eyes beheld. The corpses had remained whole. They had neither rotted, nor been eaten by predators. In appreciation of this Divine kindness, the Sages instituted this blessing, praising God for being \"good\" (for preventing them from rotting) and \"doing good\" (for allowing the corpses to be buried).<br>"], "Blessings 2.2": ["When workers are employed by an employer and eat a meal of bread, they should not recite a blessing before eating. - The obligation to recite the blessing before eating is Rabbinic in origin. In certain situations, the Sages did not institute such a requirement.<br>", "Similarly, they should recite only two blessings after eating - combining the second and third blessings and omitting the fourth.<br><i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 16a, states that although the third blessing is required by the Torah, it is not recited because the Sages have the power to withhold the fulfillment of a Torah precept. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offers a different rationale, explaining that the Rambam did not state that the Torah requires that a specific number of blessings be recited for grace.<br>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> clarifies the matter further, explaining that the Rambam maintains that the Torah requires us to mention three concepts in grace: appreciation for the sustenance God grants us, appreciation for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and appreciation for Jerusalem. According to the Torah, it does not matter how these three concepts are mentioned, whether in one blessing (as in <i>al hamichyah</i>), two blessings (as in this law), or three blessings (as is the usual case).<br>", "so that they do not neglect their employer's work. - From this we learn two concepts:a) that it is forbidden to work while reciting grace (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 2:5; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 183:12);b) how important it is for a worker to devote himself faithfully to his work. See the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i>.<br>", "[In such an instance,] the complete text of the first blessing should be recited. - Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), explains that this distinction is made because the latter two blessings resemble each other, and hence can be combined with little difficulty. In contrast, the first blessing focuses on a different theme.<br>", "In the second blessing, they should begin with the text of the blessing for Eretz Yisrael, include aspects of the blessing for the building of Jerusalem - One should recite:<br>We offer thanks to You, God, our Lord, for having granted our ancestors a precious, good, and spacious land, and Jerusalem, Your city. May You rebuild it speedily in our days (Rabbenu Manoach).<br>It may be presumed that one should also include the aspects of the second and third blessings that Halachot 3 and 4 consider as absolute requirements (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).<br>", "and conclude using the standard conclusion of the second blessing.<br>", "If they do not receive a wage, but only meals in return for their services - their responsibility to their employer is less, and they are required to recite all the blessings.<br>", "or if they eat together with their employer, they should recite the full text of the four blessings as others do. - The fact that their employer joins them can be interpreted as license to take the leisure of reciting the full text of grace.<br>At present, it is assumed that employers allow their workers greater leniency and, in all instances, workers are required to recite the entire grace (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 191:2).<br>"], "Blessings 2.3": ["The blessing for Eretz Yisrael should include an acknowledgement of thanks [to God] at its beginning and at its conclusion. - In \"The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,\" the Rambam relates that this blessing begins, \"We offer thanks to You, God, our Lord...\" and states, shortly before its conclusion, \"For all these, God, our Lord, we give thanks to You.\" An omission of the second mention of thanks, however, does not require the repetition of grace (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 187:4).<br>", "It should conclude: \"[Blessed are You, God,] for the land and for the sustenance.\" - This is a single expression of thanks, acknowledging God's gift of \"a land which produces sustenance\" (<i>Berachot</i> 49a).<br>", "Whoever does not include the phrase \"a precious, good, and spacious land\" - This expression is a combination of the praises of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> mentioned in Jeremiah 3:19 and Exodus 3:8.<br>", "in the blessing for Eretz Yisrael does not fulfill his obligation. - Unless one mentions these qualities, one has not adequately expressed one's appreciation for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The omission of this phrase requires the repetition of the grace. See Halachah 12.<br>", "A person must mention the covenant [of circumcision] - Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 48b) explains that the mitzvah of circumcision is connected with God's promise of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to Abraham, as Genesis 17:8-10 states: \"I will give you and your descendants... the entire land of Canaan.... You shall keep My covenant.... Circumcise every male.\"<br>", "and the Torah [in this blessing] - Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>) notes that a similar connection applies with regard to the Torah, as Deuteronomy 8:1 states: \"Observe all the mitzvot which I am commanding you... so that you will... inherit the land that God promised to your ancestors.\"<br>The phraseology used by the Rambam indicates that he does not require the repetition of the grace if either of these points is omitted. Other authorities (including the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 187:3) differ and require the repetition of grace in such an instance.<br>", "mentioning the covenant before the Torah. [The reason for this order - which gives priority to the covenant<br>", "is] that the covenant mentioned in the blessing for Eretz Yisrael refers to the covenant of circumcision, concerning which thirteen covenants [are mentioned in the Torah]. - Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Milah</i>, where the Rambam enumerates these thirteen expressions.<br>", "In contrast, [the Torah mentions only] three covenants with regard to the Torah, as [Deuteronomy 28:69] states: \"These are the words of the covenant... in addition to the covenant He established with you at Chorev,\" and [Deuteronomy 29:9-11] states: \"You are standing... to establish a covenant.\" - The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> notes that there are several other verses that refer to a covenant with regard to the Torah. These three, however, are unique in that they refer to the establishment of a covenant regarding the bond between the Jews and the Torah.1. <i>Berachot</i> 49a mentions both these possibilities. In \"The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,\" the Rambam quotes the former expression.2. The beginning of a blessing must share the same theme as its conclusion. Nevertheless, the rebuilding of Jerusalem shares a connection with God's showing mercy to the people of Israel, since the rebuilding of Jerusalem is an expression of God's mercy to the Jewish people (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).3. Although <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that two different concepts should not be mentioned in the conclusion of a blessing, this version of the blessing does not contradict that rule. The intent is a single request that Israel be granted the ultimate comfort, the rebuilding of Jerusalem.4. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 48b, mentions another reason for the mention of the House of David. It was David who conquered Jerusalem and established the holiness of the city. 5. Since an integral element of our celebration of the Sabbath and festivals is eating festive meals, the sacred element of the day should be mentioned in the grace recited after partaking of those meals. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the day does not require a blessing in its own right, nor is it made the essential element of the third blessing. Therefore, one begins and concludes that blessing in the same manner as is done during the week (Rashi, <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 48b).6. The order in which these alternatives are mentioned in this halachah is the reverse of that mentioned in the previous halachah. It can be explained that in the previous halachah, the Rambam mentioned the text he considered most appropriate first. The order he mentions in this halachah, however, is closer to the expression used by our Sages in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this halachah.7. Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot. With regard to Rosh HaShanah, see the commentary on Halachah 13.8. <i>Shabbat</i> 24a explains that since an additional sacrifice (<i>korban musaf</i>) is offered on these days, they possess an element of sanctity that is worthy of mention. As obvious from the contrast of Halachah 12 to Halachah 13, however, there is a difference between the obligation to mention these days and the obligation to mention Sabbaths and festivals. 9. Since Chanukah and Purim are Rabbinic holidays which are not associated with an additional sacrificial offering, they are not mentioned in the third blessing. The second blessing is more appropriate for the mention of the miracles of these holidays, since it is an expression of thanks to God (<i>Shabbat</i> 24a).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> note that from <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it would appear that while permission is granted to mention Chanukah and Purim in the second blessing, it is not an obligation to do so. In contrast, the Rambam requires that they be mentioned. They explain that since the Sages of the Talmud were wont to mention these holidays in grace, and the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 7:6) considers their mention a binding obligation, the Rambam established their mention as a requirement. See also Halachah 13 and commentary.10. Precedence is given to the Sabbath because it occurs more frequently than the festivals and is on a higher spiritual level (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). 11. \"Blessed are You, God, our Lord, 16King13 of the Universe, the God, who is our Father and our 16King13... the 16King13 who is good.\" The reason for this stress on God's sovereignty in this blessing is that the blessing recited previously mentions the sovereignty of the House of David, and the Sages wanted to emphasize how all earthly kings are subordinate to a higher authority (<i>Berachot</i> 49a).12. The blessing mentioned is quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46a. That source also contains additions to the blessing that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi would recite. 13. The Rambam's words are quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46b, which relates that Mar Zutra recited this blessing.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 379:14) relates that this blessing should be recited throughout the seven days of mourning by the mourners and by all who recite grace together with him when there is a <i>zimun</i>. Other opinions (based on <i>Ketubot</i> 8a) state that this blessing should be recited only when ten people recite grace together. The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 207:7 writes that it is Ashkenazic custom to rely on this opinion, and hence, this blessing is generally not recited.14. <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates several additions Mar Zutra made on the above occasion.15. In \"The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,\" the Rambam includes several requests beginning with the word <i>Harachaman</i> (May the Merciful One...) in his text of grace. These requests were additions to the grace made by the Geonim, who lived in the era subsequent to the Talmud. 16. This refers to the final blessing quoted in Halachah 11.17. <i>Nisu'in</i> (marriage) is marked by the entry of a bride and groom into a private chamber together. This ceremony is referred to as <i>chuppah</i> and is accompanied by a celebration. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 10, and commentaries.<br>As mentioned at the conclusion of the following halachah, according to the Rambam this blessing is recited only when ten adult males are present. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:4) differs and maintains that it should be recited even when fewer than ten people are present. Note the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:7) who states that today this blessing is never recited alone. If \"new faces\" - people who had not attended the wedding celebrations previously - are present, all seven blessings are recited. If no \"new faces\" are present (although ten males are), the meal is considered like a meal eaten by the bridegroom alone, and the blessing is not recited.18. The same laws applying to a widow or widower apply to a person who has been divorced. Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:12, the Rambam states that even if a woman has been married before, her husband should celebrate with her for three days.19. Surely, this also applies when neither the bride nor groom have been married before. <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states: \"The Sages ordained that everyone who marries a maiden should celebrate with her for seven days.\"<br>The differences between the time limits mentioned in this halachah and those mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, are worthy of comparison. See the commentary on that halachah.20. <i>Ketubot</i> 8a states that after the first day of the wedding celebrations, Rav Ashi would recite the wedding blessings only when \"new faces\" were present. In his responsa, the Rambam's son states that his father required only two \"new faces.\" Note the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 64:7 who requires only one \"new face.\" The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> write that on the Sabbath the presence of new guests is not necessary, since the Sabbath itself is considered as \"guests.\"21. <i>Ketubot</i> 7b derives this rule from the account of the wedding between Ruth and Boaz. Ruth 4:2 relates that Boaz invited ten men to witness the marriage. 22. Only six blessings are mentioned below; the seventh blessing is the blessing over the wine. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:4.)23. Rashi (<i>Ketubot</i> 7b) explains that this blessing is in praise of the creation of Adam, the first man.<br>In <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, where the text of the wedding blessings is repeated, this blessing follows the blessing \"who has created all things for His glory.\" This order is the sequence in which these blessings are recited today. It appears more appropriate, particularly according to Rashi's commentary (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which explains that the blessing \"who has created all things...\" is not directly connected to the wedding itself, but rather is recited in appreciation of the guests who have come to celebrate together with the new couple.<br>[The repetition of the text of the blessings in two separate halachot, something very out of character for the Rambam in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, has aroused the attention of the commentaries. Some have gone so far as to suggest that the text of the blessings here was added by the printers, and not by the Rambam himself.]24. Despite the fact that this blessing follows two (or three) blessings which begin with \"Blessed...,\" it also begins with \"Blessed....\" Among the explanations offered is that the first blessings are short, and if the line \"Blessed...\" were not mentioned, they would appear as a single blessing (<i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).25. Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as a reference to the creation of woman, who was created from man (\"his own self\"), and gives him the potential for reproduction (\"a structure that will last for all time\").26. \"The barren one\" refers to Jerusalem. Psalms 137:6 states: \"Let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not place Jerusalem above my highest joy.\" Thus, at the height of the wedding celebration, we recall the holy city and pray that it be rebuilt. 27. This is a prayer that the bride and groom enjoy the happiness experienced by Adam in Eve before the first sin.<br>Several manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> mention a different conclusion for this blessing, \"Blessed are You, God, who brings joy to His people, Israel, and rebuilds Jerusalem.\" (In this context, note the commentary of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)28. The blessing joins our wishes for the happiness of the particular couple with our hope for the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The ultimate marriage relationship is the bond between God and the Jewish people, which will be realized in the Messianic age. Thus, the two themes, marriage and redemption, share an intrinsic link.29. Rashi, <i>Ketubot</i> 8a, explains the difference between the last two blessings. The fifth of the blessings concludes with a request that the bride and groom enjoy a lifetime of happiness and success together. The sixth and final blessing concludes with a request that they find happiness in each other, that their wedding joy be extended throughout their lives. Alternatively, the final blessing is a blessing for the Jewish people as a whole who find fulfillment in married life.<br>"], "Blessings 2.12": ["[The following rules apply when a person who is reciting grace] on a Sabbath or a festival [concludes the third blessing - More precisely, mentions God's name in the conclusion of the third blessing. If he remembers his omission before he mentions God's name, he should add the special passage, and then repeat <i>Uvneh Yerushalayim</i>. Once he mentions God's name, however, he should complete the blessing, \"<i>boneh Yerushalayim. Amen,</i>\" and then add the blessing mentioned below.<br>", "and] forgets to mention the aspect of holiness connected with the day: - See Halachah 5.<br>", "If he remembers before he begins the fourth blessing - <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 188:9 interprets this to mean: before he mentions even a single word of the blessing.

As will be explained, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 188:8) does make such a distinction with regard to the repetition of grace. Nevertheless, if a person remembers his omission in time to add the special blessing, even the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:7) requires it to be recited after any and all meals on Sabbaths and festivals.<br>", "Blessed [are You, God...] - Our text follows the position of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, who emphasizes that this blessing contains God's name and the phrase \"King of the universe,\" as do other blessings. This view is not shared by the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and several other commentaries, who point to the fact that neither <i>Berachot</i> 49a nor the Rambam explicitly mentions God's sovereignty. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) shares the <i>Lechem Mishneh's</i> position.<br>", "who has granted rest to His people Israel as a sign and a holy covenant. Blessed are You, God, who sanctifies the Sabbath. - The Sabbath was sanctified by God on the seventh day of creation.<br>", "On the festivals: Blessed [are You, God...] who has granted festivals to His people Israel for rejoicing and for happinesss. Blessed are You, God, who sanctifies Israel and the seasons. - The sanctification of the festivals is dependent on the Jews, who fix the monthly calendar. (See <i>Beitzah</i> 17a.)<br>", "Afterwards, one should begin the fourth blessing and conclude grace - without any further changes.<br>", "If he [does not] remember [the omission of the special passages until after] he begins the fourth blessing, - i.e., even if he merely mentions the first word, <i>Baruch</i>, as explained above<br>", "he should cease [his prayers] - Based on <i>Berachot</i> 49b, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:8) mentions a difference between the first two meals on the Sabbath and festivals and any subsequent ones. We are obligated to eat only two meals that require grace on these holy days. One may fulfill his obligation for the third meal with other foods, without eating bread on the Sabbath, whereas on festivals one is not obligated to eat a third meal at all.<br>Accordingly, although there is a dimension of holiness connected with all the Sabbath and festival meals, the need to mention this dimension in grace is considered significant enough to require repetition of all the blessings only when an omission is made in the first two meals of the day.<br>It must be noted that neither the Rambam nor <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) make such a differentiation explicitly. This has led the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and others to postulate that the Rambam maintains that an omission of the Sabbath or festivals in grace is sufficient to require repetition of the blessings in any meal eaten on these holy days.<br>", "and return to the beginning [of grace], the blessing for sustenance. - If three people ate together and made the same omission, however, they do not repeat the <i>zimmun</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>:9).<br>The Ra'avad challenges the Rambam's decision, calling attention to a law quoted by the Rambam in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 10:10. When a person omits <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he is required to repeat the entire <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Nevertheless, if he is accustomed to recite prayers of supplication after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> before withdrawing from his place of prayer, and remembers while in the midst of those supplications, he is not required to repeat <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. All that is necessary is to return to the blessing <i>R'tzey</i>.<br>Similarly, the Ra'avad argues, the blessing <i>Hatov v'hametiv</i> resembles the supplicatory prayers recited after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Accordingly, one should return to the third blessing of grace and not recite the other two.<br>This opinion, although respected for its sound reasoning, is not accepted by most authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) and others quote the Rambam's view.<br>"], "Blessings 2.13": ["[The following rules apply when a person who is reciting grace] on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> [concludes the third blessing and] forgets to recite Ya'aleh v'yavo - as required in Halachah 5:<br>", "If he remembers before he begins the fourth blessing - as mentioned in the commentary on the previous halachah, this means after one has recited even a single word of the blessing.<br>", "he should recite the following: \"Blessed [are You, God...] who granted <i>Rashei Chadashim</i> to His people Israel as a remembrance.\"<br>The blessing does not include a chatimah. - Many blessings begin: \"Blessed are You, God, King of the universe...,\" and conclude, \"Blessed are You, God....\" The latter concluding phrase is referred to as a <i>chatimah</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:7.)<br><i>Berachot</i> 49a mentions that the Sages were unsure of whether this blessing should include a <i>chatimah</i> or not. Therefore, to avoid the possibility of mentioning God's name in vain, the <i>chatimah</i> is omitted.<br>", "Afterwards, he should begin the fourth blessing and conclude grace - without any further changes.<br>", "If he remembers - the omission<br>", "after beginning the fourth blessing, he should complete it - the fourth blessing<br>", "[without making any additions]. He need not repeat [the entire grace]. - <i>Berachot</i> 49b explains that although in prayer (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 10:10), the omission of <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> warrants a repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> its omission does not warrant a repetition of grace. The difference between the two is that prayer is an obligation, while eating a meal of bread is not. Since there is no obligation to recite grace on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>, failing to mention it in grace is not sufficient cause to warrant its repetition.<br>", "The same rules apply on <i>Chol HaMo\u2019ed</i> - since we are not obligated to eat a meal of bread on these days.<br>Within this context, it is worthy to mention the laws regarding the recitation of <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> on Rosh HaShanah. Neither the Rambam nor the Talmudic sources which deal with this subject (<i>Berachot</i> 49a-b and <i>Shabbat</i> 24a) mention adding <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> to grace on Rosh HaShanah. Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (188:7) takes it for granted that such an addition should be made.<br>Furthermore, if one becomes conscious of the omission of that addition before beginning the fourth blessing, one should add a special blessing to mention Rosh HaShanah. If, however, one has already begun the fourth blessing, one should continue grace without mentioning Rosh HaShanah, since there is no obligation to eat festive meals on that day. On the contrary, fasting is allowed.<br>", "[When a person reciting grace] on Chanukah or on Purim forgets to mention the uniqueness of the day in grace - <i>Al hanisim</i>, as mentioned in Halachah 6.<br>", "he need not repeat [the grace]. - The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 7:6) requires grace to be repeated for such an omission. Nevertheless, since there is no indication in the Babylonian Talmud of such an obligation (indeed, <i>Shabbat</i> 24a does not require even the recitation of <i>Al hanisim</i>), the Rambam does not accept that ruling.<br>It has, however, become customary to add <i>Al hanisim</i> among the paragraphs beginning <i>Harachaman</i> at the conclusion of grace if one forgets to recite it in its proper place (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 187:4).<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.1": ["Moses, our teacher, ordained that the Jews should read the Torah publicly on the Sabbath - See also Chapter 13, Halachah 8.<br>", "and on Monday and Thursday - <i>Tosafot, Bava Kama</i> 82a relates that these days are days of Divine favor.<br>", "mornings - The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 135:1 states that, although ideally the Torah should be read in the morning service, if one fails to do so, it may be read the entire day.<br>", "so the [people] would never have three days pass without hearing the Torah. - <i>Bava Kama</i> 82b quotes Exodus 15:22: \"And they travelled three days without finding water,\" and explains:<br>Water refers to the Torah, as [implied by Isaiah 55:1]: \"May all the thirsty go to the water.\" Since they travelled three days without Torah, they complained.

The rabbis did not want to translate the Torah into the languages which the people did understand, because of the possibility of error and misinterpretation.

The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 4:1) mentions that we should approach the Torah reading with awe, reflecting the awe experienced by the Jews at Mount Sinai.3. Rabbenu Nissim maintains that this prohibition only applied before Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi permitted the oral tradition to be recorded. Afterwards, it was permitted for the translator to use a written text. Rabbenu Nissim's position is somewhat difficult to accept, since the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this law, was written several hundred years after Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi granted this leniency. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Nissim's view was widely accepted.4. The <i>Tosefta, Megillah</i> 3:21, cites the example of Aharon, who served as a spokesman for Moses. See also <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.5.

Were the common people given the opportunity of hearing the full story of the golden calf, they might believe that it had spiritual power (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>). Alternatively, the narrative places a major burden of responsibility on Aharon (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).8.

Rather, we should structure our thoughts, setting for them guidelines, those being the mitzvot of the Torah.The Rambam explains the reason for these prohibitions:<br>In general, people have limited powers of understanding, and not all minds are capable of appreciating the truth in its fullness. - See also <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:12, 4:11,13, where the Rambam mentions the restrictions placed on the study of deeper spiritual concepts lest one err in his conception.<br>", "[Accordingly,] were a person to follow the thoughts of his heart, it is possible that he would destroy the world because of his limited understanding. - There are several ways to understand the expression used by the Rambam: \"destroy the world.\" On the most obvious level, it is a figurative expression, not to be interpreted literally. On a deeper level, it can be seen as a reference to his statements in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:4 that a person should always \"see himself and the entire world as equally balanced between merit and sin. If he commits one sin, he tips his balance and that of the entire world to guilt and brings on destruction.\"<br>Today, we can appreciate the Rambam's words in a very literal sense. Society as a whole is plagued by irrational acts of violence. and on a global level it is possible for utter destruction to be brought about if a few individuals act irresponsibly.<br>", "What is implied? There are times when a person will stray after star worship - and consider it beneficial<br>", "and - there are<br>", "times when he will wonder about God's oneness: Perhaps He is one, perhaps He is not? - In his Commentary on the Mishnah (Introduction to the Tenth Chapter of <i>Sanhedrin</i>), the Rambam lists the oneness of God as the second of his Thirteen Principles of Faith. See also <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:7, 2:10.<br>", "[He may also wonder:] - <i>Chaggigah</i> 11b states: \"It would have been better for someone who considers the [following] four matters never to have been created.\" The passage continues by mentioning the four questions quoted by the Rambam here.<br>", "What exists above the heavenly realms? What exists below them? What was before time? What will be after time? - Our translation is based on Rashi's interpretation of <i>Chaggigah</i>, <i>ibid.</i><br>", "Similarly, [one may wonder about] prophecy: Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not? - In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 7:1, the Rambam states: \"It is [one] of the foundations of [our] faith that God communicates by prophecy with man.\" Similarly, the Rambam lists the concept of prophecy as the sixth of his Thirteen Principles of Faith.<br>", "And [one may also wonder] about the Torah: Perhaps it emanates from God, perhaps it does not? - As the eighth of his Thirteen Principles of Faith, the Rambam states: \"The Torah which we have was given by Moses our teacher... and emanates - in its entirety - from the Almighty.\" He explains that this also applies to the oral law. He reiterates this concept in his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.<br>", "Since he might not know the guidelines with which to evaluate [ideas that will lead him] to the truth in its fullness, he might come to heresy. - The Rambam's statements should be interpreted, not as a restriction of one's thinking processes, but rather a call to structure our thoughts according to the guidelines provided for us by the Torah.<br>In this context, it is worthy to refer to <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13:<br>I maintain that it is not proper for a person to stroll in the <i>Pardes</i> (study Torah's mystic secrets) unless he has filled his belly with bread and meat. \"Bread and meat\" refer to the knowledge of what is permitted and what is forbidden, and similar matters concerning other mitzvot. Even though the Sages referred to these as \"a small matter\" - since our Sages said: \"'A great matter,' this is <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah</i>. 'A small matter,' this is the debates of Abbaye and Ravva\" - nevertheless, it is fitting for them to be given precedence, because they settle a person's mind.<br>Thus, the Rambam teaches that a person should not embark on the study of deep spiritual questions until he has gained the intellectual maturity which comes from Torah study. Even after a person gains such maturity, there is no need for him to concern himself with the study of idol worship because there is no value which he can derive from such study.<br><b>The Torah has warned about this matter, saying [Numbers 15:39]: \"Do not stray after your hearts and eyes, which have led you to immorality\" -</b> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 47) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 387) counts this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br><b>i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth. -</b> Instead, he should follow a structured pattern for intellectual growth and development prescribed by a Torah master.<br><b>Our Sages -</b> <i>Sifre, Sh'lach</i>.

The transgression of both of the prohibitions mentioned in this halachah involves thought and can also involve deed. Just as the commentaries suggested several deeds which violate the first prohibition, similar acts could be performed which violate the latter prohibition. The Rambam, however, appears to imply that there is no way that the latter prohibition could be transgressed in a manner warranting punishment.<br>"], "Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.4": ["The commandment [forbidding] the worship of false gods is equivalent to all the mitzvot, as [implied by Numbers 15:22]: \"Lest you err and not perform all the mitzvot....\" - The passage implies that it is speaking about a single sin; nevertheless, the verse specifically mentions \"all the mitzvot.\"<br>", "The oral tradition - <i>Sifre, Sh'lach</i> and <i>Horayot</i> 8a, resolves this seeming contradiction and<br>", "teaches that the verse refers to - a single prohibition which is equivalent to the violation of the entire Torah.

There are many Rabbinic authorities who are highly critical of the Hasmoneans for assuming the kingship of the Jewish people. (See the Ramban's commentary on the Torah, <i>Parashat Vayichi</i>.) Although in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:7-8, the Rambam writes that King David's descendants have an eternal right to the monarchy in Jerusalem, his description here of the Hasmoneans as kings does not have the slightest intimation of criticism; if anything, the contrary is true.<br>Several laws regarding the nature of kingship are derived from the Hasmonean kings and others, even from the kings of Herod's dynasty, who ruled after them.<br>"], "Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.3": ["Accordingly, the Sages of that generation - <i>Shabbat</i> 21b states that the celebration of the holiday was ordained in the year following the miracle.<br>", "ordained that these eight days, which begin from the twenty-fifth of Kislev, should be commemorated - There are many who question why the holiday is celebrated for eight days, since the miracle was only for seven (for there was enough oil for the Menorah to burn for a single day).

The miraculous lighting of the <i>Menorah</i> began on the twenty-fifth of Kislev and continued for eight days.<br>[Note, however, the <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 670:1), who explains that, according to the Rambam, the first day of the celebration was instituted in appreciation of the military victories, while the remaining seven came in recognition of the miracle of the <i>Menorah</i>.]<br>", "as days of happiness - an acknowledgement of God's miracles in a material context in appreciation of the military victories.<br>As the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Purim</i>, Chapter 2, \"happiness\" is associated with feasting.

This is not the case.<br>", "but rather, at all times - i.e., on all the days that the complete Hallel is recited, [the obligation to do so] is a Rabbinic ordinance. - The Ra'avad notes that the Sages (see <i>Pesachim</i> 95b, <i>Arachin</i> 10b) consider Isaiah 30:29, \"This song shall be to you as the night of the sanctification of the festivals\" to be a reference to the recitation of <i>Hallel</i>. Because of this association with a Biblical verse, he considers the obligation to recite <i>Hallel</i> as different in status from other Rabbinic commandments. Indeed, the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> considers this obligation to be one of the 613 mitzvot. This runs contrary to the position the Rambam mentions in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 1), where he states that even those mitzvot ordained by the prophets are considered to be Rabbinic commandments.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the verse in Isaiah reflects a command to recite <i>Hallel</i> in appreciation whenever God redeems us from difficulties. (For this reason, it is customary in certain communities to recite <i>Hallel</i> on the anniversary of a miraculous deliverance.) The custom of reciting <i>Hallel</i> on festivals, however, was established afterwards.<br>", "There are eighteen days during the year when it is a mitzvah to recite the entire Hallel - in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There are three more days in the diaspora, as mentioned in the following halachah.<br>", "They are: the eight days of Sukkot, the eight days of Chanukah, the first day of Pesach - In contrast to the holiday of Sukkot, when a different <i>musaf</i> sacrifice is offered each day, on Pesach the same <i>musaf</i> sacrifice is offered every day throughout the holiday. Therefore, the entire <i>Hallel</i> is recited on the first day alone (<i>Arachin</i> 10b).<br>(Note also <i>Megillah</i> 10b, which states in connection to the splitting of the Red Sea, the major miracle associate with the later days of Pesach, \"My creations are drowning in the sea and you desire to say <i>Hallel</i>!\")<br>", "and the holiday of Shavuot. Hallel is not recited on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, since they are days of repentence, awe, and fear, and are not days of extra - Rosh HaShanah is a day of happiness.

This view, however, is not accepted by most authorities, and the prevailing practice is to follow their ruling.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:11, where the Rambam states that it is not absolutely necessary to read the different passages of the <i>Shema</i> in order. On the other hand, there the Rambam explains his decision, stating that the passages of the <i>Shema</i> are not found in this order in the Torah. In contrast, the psalms of <i>Hallel</i> are recited in the order they are found in the Bible.<br>", "If a person reads and pauses, reads and pauses, even if he pauses for a time long enough to complete the entire [Hallel], he fulfills his obligation. - From <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 34b, we can conclude that the laws that apply to the reading of the Megillah also apply to the reading of <i>Hallel</i>.

The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, however, is more restrictive and allows interruptions only when there is a need.<br>In their analysis of <i>Berachot</i> 14a (the source for this halachah), Rabbenu Asher and other commentaries differ and compare the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>.

When he mentioned this to Rabbi Yosse, the son of Rabbi Zevida, the latter reprimanded him, explaining that he would be doing them a great favor by having them stand before him, because this would lead to the fear of God, as implied by Leviticus (<i>ibid.</i>): \"Stand up before a white-haired [man]...and you shall fear your God.\"<br>The <i>Bnei Binyamin</i> explains that everything depends on the sage's intention.

This statement implies that there is a certain leniency with regard to a ban imposed because of the embarrassment of a Torah sage. However, the first of the 24 reasons the Rambam lists for imposing a ban of ostracism that must be observed by every Jew is disgracing a Torah sage. (See <i>Avodat Hamelech</i>.)<br>Among the resolutions of the difficulty offered is that there is a difference between a ban imposed by a court according to Torah law and a ban issued by a sage individually to protect his own honor.<br>", "However, a person who was placed under a ban of ostracism for another reason for which such a ban may be declared - as are enumerated below<br>", "even if the ban was declared by a person of the lowest stature in Israel - the nasi and all Jews are obligated to abide by the terms of the ban - <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 17a relates that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi's maidservant declared a ban of ostracism on a person, and the entire Jewish people observed that ban for three years.<br>", "until he repents for the matter for which the ban was imposed and the ban is lifted. - See Chapter 7, Halachah 7.<br>", "A ban of ostracism is imposed upon a person - either man or woman - Most of the instances where the Talmud mentions a ban of ostracism concern men.

A significant number of reasons are also mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 3:1); however, the majority of the reasons mentioned by the Rambam below were gathered by him from many different passages throughout the Talmud.<br>", "a) a person who disgraces a sage - as explained above<br>", "even after his passing - <i>Berachot</i> 19a relates that a ban was imposed on a person for disgracing the sages Shemayah and Avtalion, even after their passing.<br>", "b) a person who embarrasses a messenger of a court - <i>Kiddushin</i> 70b relates that Rav would impose a ban of ostracism for this reason.<br>", "c) a person who calls a colleague a slave - See <i>Kiddushin</i> 28a.<br>", "d) a person who was ordered [to appear before] a court at a specific time and did not come - See <i>Bava Kama</i> 112b and also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 25:8.<br>", "e) a person who treats even one point of Rabbinic law with disrespect - <i>Eduyot</i> 5:6 relates that Eliezer ben Chanoch was placed under ban for raising difficulties regarding the practice of washing one's hands, a Rabbinic ordinance.<br>", "needless to say, this applies regarding [matters of] Torah law - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the Rambam uses the expression, \"treats with disrespect.\" If a person transgresses a command, he is punished by other means. However, ostracism is imposed for causing others to view a Torah or Rabbinic law disparagingly.<br>", "f) a person who refuses to comply with the decisions [rendered by a court] is placed under ban until he complies - <i>Bava Kama</i> 113a serves as the source for this law. Note the slight difference between the Rambam's statements here and those in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> <i>ibid.</i><br><b>g) a person who possesses an entity that can cause damage - e.g., a dangerous dog or a faulty ladder - is placed under ban until he removes that entity -</b> This concept, with these two examples, is quoted from <i>Bava Kama</i> 15b.<br><b>h) a person who sells land to a gentile is placed under ban until he accepts responsibility for any damages which the gentile may cause his Jewish neighbor -</b> <i>Bava Kama</i> 112a mentions this point.<br><i>Tosafot</i> postulates that this restriction applies only when a Jewish colleague is prepared to pay the same amount as the gentile. However, if the gentile offers more than the Jew, the owner is not liable to sustain the loss. However, in <i>Hilchot Sh'chenim</i> 12:7, where the Rambam quotes this law, he does not make such a provision. Furthermore, in several of his responsa, he forbids selling property that borders on the property of a fellow Jew to a gentile, even when substantial losses are involved (Rav Kapach).<br><b>i) a person who testifies against a Jewish colleague in a secular court and causes money which Torah law would not [require him to pay] to be expropriated from him is placed under ban until he repays [that amount] -</b> See <i>Bava Kama</i> 113b.

Hence, he clarifies that, at present, since we use a fixed calendar, the observance of the second day of the festivals is no longer considered to be a Rabbinic decree and is only a custom.

In <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 1:26, the Rambam states that this halachah applies even if later the knife was inspected and found to be kosher. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that leniency is taken in this matter, because it has become customary for ritual slaughter to be performed only by experts.

It can be derived from the leniency allowing one to maintain possession of chametz belonging to a gentile mentioned at the conclusion of the Halachah. Some authorities explain that the Rambam derived the concept from the <i>Mechiltah</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.<br>In his commentary on the Torah (Exodus 12:19 , the Ramban differs with the concept in its entirety and states that a person does not transgress the prohibition against possessing chametz when it is entrusted to a gentile.

Two explanations are offered why, in the present instance, a more stringent measure is required:<br>a) the amount of chametz the gentile entrusted for safekeeping is probably too large to be covered by utensils;<br>b) covering the chametz with a utensil is only a temporary measure, intended to be effective only until the end of the day of the festival. Once that day is concluded, the chametz must be destroyed. In contrast, in this instance the chametz will remain in the Jew's possession throughout the entire holiday. Hence, more severe measures must be taken.<br>The Ramban and the <i>Ba'al HaItur</i> do not accept this requirement and maintain that if a Jew does not accept responsibility for the chametz, he is not obligated to construct a partition. All that is necessary is that the chametz be placed out of the way. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:2) and the later halachic authorities all follow the Rambam's opinion.<br>", "[With regard to chametz] that has been consecrated, this is unnecessary; everyone shies away from consecrated property, lest they infringe on [the prohibition of]<br>\u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4. \u2014 Leviticus 5:15-16 describes the prohibition of \u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4, the misappropriation of consecrated property for personal use.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.3": ["A gentile who entrusted his chametz to a Jew: Should the Jew accept the responsibility of -- caring for the chametz as a watchman would, and<br>", "paying for the worth of the chametz if it is lost or stolen -- due to factors other than his personal negligence.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:13,16) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> advise following the latter opinion.<br>", "behold, he is obligated to destroy it -- before the sixth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan.<br>", "Since he accepted responsibility for it -- and would have to pay for it if it is lost.<br><i>Pesachim</i> 5b offer two possible explanations why the chametz is considered as if it belongs to the Jew. One opinion maintains that throughout the Torah, an article that causes financial liability is considered as one's responsibility.<br>Another opinion maintains that in this instance, since the Torah adds a special commandment \"leaven should not be found,\" extra stringency must be taken. From this discussion, we see that the responsibility to destroy this chametz stems from the Torah itself, and is not merely a matter of Rabbinic decree.<br>", "it is considered as though it were his -- and, hence, must be destroyed. <i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 6a maintains that if a Jew designates a specific place within his home for the gentile and tells him to place his chametz there, he is not obligated to destroy it even though he accepted responsibility for it. Rashi does not accept this position. From the Rambam's omission of the matter, we may assume he also follows Rashi's view (<i>Lechem Mishnah</i>).<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:1) quotes the Rambam and hence, requires the acceptance of the more stringent position. However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (440:16) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (440:3) mention certain leniencies based on <i>Tosefot's</i> position.<br>", "If he did not accept responsibility for it -- the gentile's chametz<br>", "he may keep it in his domain -- without transgressing the prohibitions against possessing chametz<br>", "and may eat from it after Pesach -- in contrast to chametz possessed by a Jew during Pesach which is forbidden to be used (Halachah 1:4)<br>", "for it was in the gentile's possession -- <i>Pesachim</i> 6a mentions a situation where a gentile brings chametz that he wishes to entrust to a Jew, and the latter designates a particular portion of the house for him to put the chametz.

Nevertheless, since he told the gentile to put it in one specific place, it is considered as if that place belongs to the gentile, and thus the chametz is not found in the Jew's possession.<br>The Rambam does not accept this interpretation and requires the gentile's chametz to be destroyed whenever a Jew accepts responsibility for it.

The Ra'avad maintains that, generally, the fact that a borrower does not specify that the security would retroactively become the lender's property implies that he never really intended to sell it to him and always considers it as his own. Thus, were such a transaction to be carried out between Jews, the Ra'avad maintains that the security would never become the lender's property. However, he explains that this law applies only regarding business dealings carried out between Jews, and not to those involving gentiles. Therefore, in this instance, the chametz given as security becomes the gentile's property.<br>In contrast, the Rambam does not consider such an agreement an <i>Asmachtah</i>. However, he does not accept a gentile's right to an article given as security. Hence, though the date for repayment passes before Pesach, he still considers the article as belonging to its original Jewish owner.<br>In this matter, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> follows the more stringent view if the chametz is worth more than the loan, and forbids its use after Pesach. However, if it is not worth more than the loan, that text and, similarly, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>, require the Jewish borrower to redeem his chametz before Pesach. However, if he fails to so, they allow people to rely on the Ra'avad's opinion and benefit from the chametz.<br>Different laws apply to chametz given to a Jew as security by a gentile or by another Jew. In the former instance, a Jew is considered the owner of the chametz if the agreement included the clause specifying retroactive ownership, even though the time for payment is not fixed until after Pesach. If the agreement lacked that clause, and the Jew is not held responsible for the chametz (see Halachah 3 above), the Jew is not liable for that chametz (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>).

For this reason, it is not advisable for a person to sell his chametz himself.

The prohibitions against <i>terumah</i> (and any other substances which are also called <i>terumah</i>) are lifted when it becomes mixed with 100 times their amount of other substances and similarly, the prohibitions against <i>orlah</i> and <i>kilai hakerem</i> are lifted when these substances are mixed with 200 times their amount of other substances.<br>Because of the serious nature of the prohibition against idol worship, these principles do not apply and anything connected with it is forbidden, regardless of the proportion of the mixture the forbidden substances make up.

Indeed, in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 16:10, when discussing the prohibitions of a \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d7\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1 (a forbidden substance whose importance prevents it from ever being nullified in a mixture), the Rambam himself appears to follow this view, stating:<br>If one pomegranate from a mixture [containing a forbidden pomegranate] falls together with two other pomegranates... and from these three, one pomegranate falls together with other pomegranates, the latter [mixture] is permitted.<br>Indeed, on the basis of the statements in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) deviates from the Rambam's opinion and requires three mixtures.<br>This approach, however, is not followed by all commentaries. Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) explain that even with regard to a \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d7\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1, only two mixtures are necessary. These views are quoted as halachah by the <i>Turei Zahav</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> in their glosses on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:8).<br>Among the suggestions made by the commentaries to resolve the difference between the Rambam's statements here and those in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> are the following:a) Most people are careful regarding the prohibition against benefiting from any object connected with idol worship. Therefore, there is no need to reinforce the prohibition. In contrast, the prohibition against benefiting from a \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d7\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1 is far less known. Hence, the Rabbis added severe safeguards to make sure that it be observed (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).b) Here, the Rambam is speaking about a prohibition against benefiting from a forbidden object (\u05d0\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d0\u05d4). In contrast, <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> is concerned with partaking of forbidden foods, where the prohibition is more severe (<i>Siftei Cohen</i>, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:52).<br>Even the authorities who permit the second mixture to be used do not allow a single individual to partake of the entire mixture at one time. In such an instance, there would be only a single doubt whether he used the forbidden object or not.<br>The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, 74b) mentioned another example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:<br><b>Should a ring [used to adorn] an idol become mixed together with one hundred other rings, and -</b> they would thus all be forbidden according to the above principles. However, if<br><b>then two of them fall -</b> accidentally. If one intentionally throws one into the sea, the leniency does not apply (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:7).<br><b>into the Mediterranean Sea -</b> and are thus lost. If two merely become separated from the group, the others remain prohibited (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.). (Note the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> comments that here, the Dead Sea is intended.)<br><b>it is permissible to use all of them. -</b> i.e., all the rings that remain. The prohibition does not continue to apply, because<br><b>We presume that the [forbidden] ring was among the two -</b> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that when stating a similar law in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 15:2, the Rambam required only a single barrel of wine to be lost. The difference between these two laws can be resolved by taking into account the nature of the prohibited substances: Rings are small, and the loss of a single ring does not make a substantial difference to the entire group. In contrast, barrels of wine are large, and the loss of even one will attract attention.<br>[which fell]. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) limits this leniency, stating that it is forbidden to use a single ring alone, nor may one person benefit from the entire group of rings at once.<br>The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) mentioned a third example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:<br><b>Should [a forbidden ring] become mixed together with a hundred others and -</b> they would thus be forbidden according to the above principles. However, if<br><b>then [the group] becomes divided, forty -</b> i.e., the minority<br><b>being separated in one group, and sixty -</b> i.e., the majority<br><b>in another, and then the entire [group of] forty fall into another group of rings, it is permissible to use all of them -</b> the second mixture.<br><b>We presume that the forbidden ring remained among the majority. -</b> There is a doubt whether the forbidden ring was among the forty. Even if it had been included within that forty, perhaps the ring one chooses from the second mixture is not the forbidden one.<br>In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) does not accept the Rambam's view, and forbids the second mixture. Even according to the Rambam, it is not permissible to eat the entire second mixture at one time, for then there would be only a single doubt.<br><b>If the -</b> entire<br><b>[group of] sixty fall into another group of rings, they are all forbidden. -</b> Should, however, only a portion of the sixty fall into another mixture, the Rambam (but not the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>) would permit their use.

According to his opinion, the prohibition stems from the impurity of idol worship.<br>", "If he has no other route, he may pass under it, provided he runs - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> (ibid.) relates that Rav Sheshet would run when he passed under an <i>asherah</i>.

Rather, one must knock the chicks down with a stave, and then collect them.

There, the Rambam specifically writes that when taking the nest - as stated in the final clause of this halachah - it permissible to climb up the tree in the normal manner. Therefore, it appears that one should knock down the chicks to see if they are capable of flying on their own or not. This explanation also clarifies why the Rambam does not mention in this halachah the need to knock down the chicks. By stating that only those which do not need their mother are permitted, he implies that one must determine whether or not the chicks need their mother (Rav Kapach).<br>", "In contrast, the chicks and eggs which need their mother are forbidden, for the asherah is considered as if it is a base for them. - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 42b explains that this is a Rabbinic decree imposed lest the people desire to benefit from the <i>asherah</i> itself.

The coals and the heat produced by the initial fire, however, are not forbidden and one may bake with them. He does not make such statements here, because, as stated in Halachah 10, even the coals and ashes of an <i>asherah</i> are forbidden.<br>[Curiously, when mentioning these laws in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (142:4), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i>, substituting forbidden wood for <i>orlah</i>, without distinguishing between the different prohibitions.

In Talmudic times, the ovens were made of clay and the clay would not harden sufficiently until the oven was kindled once. Thus, since kindling the oven for the first time prepared it to be used on all subsequent occasions, some Rabbis forbade its use when this first kindling was made with a forbidden substance. This opinion is, nevertheless, not accepted as halachah. The Rambam's view is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i>, ibid.

Since they were offered on the Temple altar, as explained above, they are forbidden even if they are not found within the temple of an idol.

The rabbinic authorities of these areas interpreted these laws more leniently, offering different explanations of how one could benefit from church-owned property. (See Ramah and the <i>Turei Zahav, Yoreh De'ah</i>, ibid.)

Does your Torah not command: 'Let nothing which is condemned cling to your hand'?He responded: \"One does not reply in a bathhouse.\" After he had departed, he told him, \"I did not come into her territory, she came into mine. One does not say, 'This bathhouse is becoming to Aphrodite.' One says, 'Aphrodite is becoming to the bathhouse.' Furthermore, no matter how much money you were offered, you would not enter your idol's temple naked... and urinate before it.\" (The mishnah continues, mentioning the interpretation of Deuteronomy 12:2 quoted by the Rambam.)<br>[Significantly, Rashi (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 44b) interprets the mishnah differently from the Rambam. They explain that rather than the idol being located within the bathhouse, the bathhouse was located within premises belonging to the idol.]<br>", "because it is placed there for aesthetic purposes and not to be served. - This is the Rambam's interpretation of Rabban Gamliel's first point. He did not enter a place where the statue was served (Aphrodite's territory). Rather, he entered a bathhouse (his territory) where a statue had been placed as an adornment.<br>[The Rambam's interpretation is also found in the <i>Tosafot Rid</i> and the <i>Eshkol</i>.

Other authorities, however, do not share this opinion, and maintain that there is no prohibition against using such a knife.

Thus, the animal's slaughter enhances its value.<br>", "and this improvement involves benefit from an accessory of idol worship. - Hence, it is forbidden, as stated in Halachah 2. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that, based on Halachot 12 and 13, it would appear that the Rambam maintains that all the meat from the animal is forbidden, and there is no way one may benefit from it. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> does not accept that view, and argues that it is sufficient to destroy an amount of meat equivalent to the value of the knife.<br>Similarly, it is forbidden to cut meat - i.e., cut large pieces of meat into smaller ones<br>", "with [such a knife], because one is enhancing its value - making it fit to be sold or cooked. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 142:6) relates that if one cut pieces of meat with such a knife, even the Rambam would not forbid use of the meat entirely. It would be necessary, however, to destroy an amount of meat equivalent to the value of the knife.<br>", "Should one cut with a destructive intent, causing a loss - e.g., cut pieces which are of a size fit for cooking into smaller ones, which would be less attractive.

This position is not accepted by all authorities. For example, the <i>Avudraham</i> considers the blessings associated with the prayer service as a separate category of blessings.<br>", "These are: When a person gets into bed - Note the <i>Otzar HaGeonim</i> which requires that both this blessing and the <i>Shema</i> be recited in one's bed, directly before retiring.<br>", "to sleep at night - The Rambam begins his discussion of the blessings of prayer with one recited at night in keeping with the concept that the new day starts after sunset.

He also notes that the Yemenite siddur, which was composed in accordance with the Rambam's opinion, follows this version. Rav Yitzchok Alfasi's <i>Halachot</i>, which the Rambam often used as a source, also omits this clause.<br>", "and illuminates the pupil of the eye - See the <i>Targum</i> to Psalms 17:8.

Accustom me to commandments and not to transgressions and bring me not to sin or transgression, trial, or embarrassment.<br>This text is found in the Siddur of Rav Amram Gaon. The Vilna Gaon, in his emendations to the Talmud, suggests that these requests were not originally included in the Talmud and were added later by Rav Amram Gaon.<br>", "to save me from the evil inclination and from a bad occurrence.

As we go to sleep at night in a dark world, we express our thanks for the Divine light that constantly fills the world.<br>The recitation of a blessing for sleep is based on our Sages' conception of sleep as one of God's greatest gifts because it allows man to rest and awake refreshed, able to serve his Creator with renewed energy and vigor. In <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 9:8, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar interprets the words uttered by God at the end of the sixth day of creation, \"and behold it was very good\" (Genesis 1:30 , as referring to the creation of sleep.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.2": ["[Then,] - <i>Berachot</i> 60b states that one first recites <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and then, the blessing of <i>hamapil</i> (the blessing discussed in Halachah 1). This opinion is quoted by the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 239:1). However, this order is only followed in Nusach Ari. Both Nusach Ashkenaz and Nusach Sephard follow the order stated by the Rambam.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1) relates that Rav Zeira was accustomed to recite the <i>Shema</i> over and over until he fell asleep. This indicates that the <i>Shema</i> is the last thing said at night before sleeping (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> in the name of Rabbenu Nissim Gaon).<br>", "one reads the first section - This is consistent with our text of <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) which states that, before going to sleep, one recites \"from <i>Shema</i> until <i>V'haya im shamoa</i>.\" This is the opinion followed in most communities at present.<br>Rabbenu Chananel rules that one recites the first two sections of <i>Shema</i> since both contain the phrases \"with all your heart\" and \"while laying down\" (See the commentary below). Rabbenu Asher also follows this position.<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (239:1) quotes the <i>Ari</i>, Rabbi Yitzchok Luria, as requiring the recitation of all three sections of the <i>Shema</i> so that the 248 words it contains will guard the 248 limbs of the body during sleep. According to the opinion of Rashi mentioned below, it is also necessary to read all three sections.<br>", "of Kri'at Shema and goes to sleep - <i>Berachot</i> 4b explains that \"it is a mitzvah\" to recite the <i>Shema</i> before retiring. These statements are based on Psalms 4:5: \"Tremble, but do not sin. Speak in your heart upon your bed and be still.\" Our Sages interpreted \"Speak in your heart\" and \"upon your bed\" as allusions to the phrases \"with all your heart\" and \"upon your bed\" in the<i>Shema</i>.<br>That Talmudic passage implies that the reason for reciting the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is to protect oneself from undesirable influences during the night. According to Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) and others who allow the evening service to be recited before sunset, the recitation of <i>Shema</i> before retiring enables us to fulfill the mitzvah of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. According to the writings of the Ari, the reciting of the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is a service of spiritual preparation for the soul's ascent from the body during sleep.<br>Since <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that \"it is a mitzvah\" to recite the <i>Shema</i> before retiring, it was customary in certain communities to recite a blessing before reciting the <i>Shema</i> as is customary before performing other mitzvot. In his responsa (<i>Pe'air HaDor</i> 100), the Rambam specifically rules against reciting such a blessing. [However, note the <i>Kolbo</i> (29) who quotes the Rambam as stating in a responsa that such a blessing is required.]<br>", "[This applies] even if his wife is sleeping with him. - This line does not appear in either the Oxford or Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:<i>ibid.</i> which permits the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> while touching one's wife because one is familiar with her.<br>", "If he is overcome by sleep, - and cannot recite the entire first section, at the very least<br>", "he should read the first verse [of Kri'at Shema] - which contains the essential statement of the unity of God.<br>", "or verses of mercy - <i>Berachot</i> 4b-5a states:<br>Rabbi Nachman says: \"A Torah scholar need not [recite <i>Kri'at Shema</i> before sleep] for his Torah will protect him.\"Abbaye says: \"Even a Torah scholar must recite at least one verse describing God's mercy, for example: 'Into Your hand I entrust my spirit, You will redeem me, God, God of truth' (Psalms 31:6 .<br><i>Sh'vuot</i> 16b mentions that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would recite Psalm 91 as protection against unfavorable influences at night.

This makes it clear that a person who wakes up in the middle of the night and intends to return to sleep, need not recite this blessing.<br>", "while still in bed - Rabbenu Yonah (in his commentary to the <i>Halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchok Alfasi) takes issue with this statement. He writes:<br>This is difficult to understand. Since [upon waking] one's hands are not clean, how is it possible that [the Rambam] says that one should recite these blessings [while still in bed]. The Talmud mentions this [practice. However, this is because the Sages] were particularly holy. They would wash their hands [at night before sleep] and would be able to maintain a state [of purity] such that they could recite the blessings in the morning in cleanliness. We, however, are unable to maintain this state of cleanliness. Therefore, it is proper that we recite them only after \u05e0\u05d8\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd (the washing of the hands).<br>This position is widely accepted and is the basis of our practice today. See the commentary to Halachah 9.<br>", "he says: My Lord - In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:1, the Rambam writes:<br>All of the blessings begin with <i>Baruch</i> and conclude with <i>Baruch</i> except the final blessing of the blessings associated with the <i>Shema</i>, a blessing which follows directly after another blessing, and a blessing over fruit, those [blessings] which resemble it, or a blessing for mitzvot.<br>Given this statement, the commentaries wonder why this blessing does not begin with <i>Baruch</i>. Furthermore, in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:5, the Rambam writes that, unless a blessing follows another blessing, it must mention God's sovereignty over the world and no such mention is made in this blessing.<br>The <i>Meiri</i> in his commentary to <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) offers the following resolution to these difficulties: Despite the fact that the entire period of a person's sleep divides between the recitation of <i>hamapil</i> and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i>, the sleep is not considered as an interruption and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is considered as following directly after <i>hamapil</i>. Accordingly, it is not required to begin with <i>Baruch</i> or mention God's sovereignty.<br>Other commentaries who follow different halachic perspectives than the Rambam offer these resolutions:1) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is a blessing of praise and prayer and does not require an opening phrase of blessing, in the same way that the blessing recited before travelling does not (<i>Tosafot, Pesachim</i> 104b).2) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is generally recited immediately after the blessing of \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e6\u05e8 and therefore can be considered as a blessing which follows another blessing.<br>", "the soul that You have placed within me - Each morning, we renew our thanks for the soul which God has returned to us, refreshed and revitalized.<br>", "is pure. - Despite his lowly physical state, man possesses an innate spirituality, a pure Godly soul, which is the source of all his positive actions and thoughts.<br>", "You have created it, You have formed it, You have breathed it into me - The three verbs used in this blessing correspond to three different descriptions of the creation of man in the Torah:1) \u05d5\u05d9\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0-\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd - \"And the Lord created man\" (Genesis 1:27 .2) \u05d0-\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05e6\u05e8 \u05d4' - \"And God, the Lord, formed man\" (Genesis 2:7 .3) \u05d5\u05d9\u05e4\u05d7 \u05d1\u05d0\u05e4\u05d9\u05d5 \u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05ea \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd - \"And He blew into his nostrils the soul of life\" (<i>ibid.</i>).<br>These three verbs also relate to the three components of the soul, \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9, \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7, \u05d5\u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05d4 (<i>Maharsha, 14Berachot</i> 60b).<br>In Kabbalah, the three verbs are understood as referring to the three worlds: \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05d4 - the world of creation, \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 - the world of form, and \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05e2\u05e9\u05d9\u05d4 - the world of physical action. The word \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05d4 - \"pure\" refers to \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05d0\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea - the world of emanation, the highest of the four worlds. Thus, this prayer traces the descent of man's soul from God's Throne of Glory into the physical world.<br>", "and You preserve it within me. - Although the natural inclination of the soul is to return to its Source, God preserves its presence within the body in order that the person may serve His Creator in this world (<i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 62).<br>", "You will ultimately take it from me - at the time of death.<br>", "and restore it to me in the Time to Come - at the time of the resurrection of the dead.<br>", "As long as the soul is lodged - Though the word, \"lodged,\" is present in the printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, it is lacking in most manuscripts. Similarly, it is not included in the text of the blessing in most siddurim.<br>", "within me, I am thankful before You, O God, my Lord, Master of all works. - Some siddurim add the phrase, \"Lord of all souls,\" at this point so that the concluding phrase of the body of the blessing will correspond to the wording of the blessing itself.<br>", "Blessed are You, God, who restores souls to dead bodies. - <i>Berachot</i> 57b compares sleep to 1/60 of death. Therefore, waking can be compared to the resurrection of the dead (Rabbi Ya'akov Emden in his commentary on the siddur).<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.4": ["When one hears the crow of a rooster, he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who gives the rooster understanding to distinguish between day and night. - Since the crowing of the rooster generally heralds the dawn, the Sages established this blessing in response to it.<br>The word \u05e9\u05db\u05d5\u05d9 is translated as \"rooster\" based on <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26a which refers to Job 38:36: \"Who has put wisdom in the inward parts and [given] understanding to the rooster (\u05e9\u05db\u05d5\u05d9).\"<br>Rabbenu Asher (in his halachic commentary to <i>Berachot</i>) interprets \u05e9\u05db\u05d5\u05d9 as \"heart.\" The heart is the source of understanding which allows man to distinguish between day and night.<br>", "When he puts on his clothes, - This refers to one's outer garment.

In contrast, Rabbenu Yitzchok Alfasi interprets the Talmud's statement as referring to donning the <i>tallit</i>.<br><i>Tosafot</i> and other Ashkenazic authorities maintain that this blessing should be reciting upon putting on a hat, yarmulke, or other headcovering.<br>", "he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who crowns Israel in glory. - The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) associates this blessing with the prohibition of walking four cubits with one's head uncovered (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b; See <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 5:6). Covering our heads symbolizes Israel's fear and awe before God's presence. This is their glory, as Isaiah 62:3 states: \"You shall be a crown of glory in the hand of God.\"<br>", "When he passes his hands over his eyes - In order to cause sleep to pass from their eyes, people often rub them vigorously.<br>Our text of <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states when \"one opens his eyes.\" Many authorities favor this version over the text quoted by the Rambam (and Rav Yitzchok Alfasi) because <i>Shabbat</i> 108b warns of the dire consequences of touching one's eyes before washing one's hands in the morning. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46:2) suggests that people might have avoided the problem by cleaning their eyes with a cloth or rubbing their eyes with closed eyelids (<i>Sha'arei Teshuvah</i>).<br>", "he recites: [Blessed...] who opens the eyes of the blind. - This blessing is based on Psalms 146:18 and can be interpreted as a statement of gratitude for more than our physical eyesight. We thank God for the ability to see His greatness in creation. These are our metaphorical \"eyes of reason.\"<br>", "When he sits up in his bed, he recites: [Blessed...] who unties those bound. - thanking God for the ability to move our limbs after sleep.<br>", "When he lowers his feet from the bed and rests them on the ground, he recites: [Blessed...] who spreads the earth over the waters - This blessing is based on Psalms 136:6: \"[Give thanks] to the One who spread the earth over the waters, for His lovingkindness is eternal.\"<br>", "When he stands up, he recites: [Blessed...] who straightens the bowed. - This is based on Psalms 146:8. This blessing expresses gratitude for the uniquely human characteristic of upright posture. It may also be interpreted as giving thanks to God, the source of salvation for those bowed and downtrodden.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) states that if one recites this blessing before the blessing \"who unties those bound,\" he should refrain from reciting the latter blessing. Though there is some difference of opinion about the matter, most later authorities accept the <i>Tur's</i> decision.<br>", "When he washes his hands, - In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:2, the Rambam specifically states that one should recite this blessing before washing one's hands so that the blessing will precede the performance of the mitzvah (<i>Pesachim</i> 7a). Rabbenu Yonah states that one should not recite this blessing until after washing one's hands because until one has washed his hands, he is not in a fit state to mention God's name (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 4:2). (According to others, the recitation of this blessing should be delayed until after drying one's hands.)<br>The Rambam obviously does not accept this rationale since he requires many blessings to be recited before the washing of the hands as above.<br>", "he recites: [Blessed...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us - Although this washing was instituted by the Rabbis, this wording is appropriate, as is explained in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>", "regarding the washing of hands. - This washing is required in preparation for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> and the morning service.<br>Based on the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. I, 169b, 184b), the Rabbis rule that, on washing in the morning, one pours water over his hands three times alternately, i.e., once over the right hand, once over the left hand, once more over the right, etc. This is done in order to remove the spirit of impurity that remains after sleep.<br>", "When he washes his face - Note Chapter 4, Halachah 2, which states that a person must wash his face in the morning as a preparation for prayer.<br>", "he recites: - There are slight, but significant, differences between the text of the blessing here and its source in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>", "Blessed are You, God, Our Lord, King of the universe, who removes the bonds of sleep from my eyes - The last traces of drowsiness disappear when one washes his face (<i>Avudraham</i>).<br><b>and slumber from my eyelids. May it be Your will, God, -</b> This entire prayer is considered one blessing. Therefore, one should not recite \"Amen\" after hearing a colleague recite the opening sentence of the blessing (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 46:1). <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) states that one should say \"and may it be...\" to emphasize that the prayer is a single blessing.<br><b>my Lord and Lord of my fathers, that You accustom me -</b> The Rambam, and similarly the <i>Tur</i>, use the first person singular, thus, making the prayer an individual statement. However, most siddurim use the first person plural, \"us.\"<br><b>to the performance of [Your] commandments and do not accustom me to sins or transgressions.

Nevertheless, its instructions apply whenever one relieves himself.<br>[Note, however, the opinion quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 6:1, which maintains that the blessing, \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e6\u05e8, can be considered as one of the morning blessings and should be recited even if one does not relieve oneself.]<br>", "before entering, he says: Be honored, holy honorable ones, servants of the Most High. - This statement is quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 60b, but there are slight variations between the way the passage appears in the Talmud, the manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, and its published text.<br>In his commentary to <i>Berachot</i>, Rashi explains that this statement is addressed to the angels that accompany us at all times as Psalms 91:11 states: \"He will command all His angels for you, to guard you in all your ways.\"<br>", "Help me.

For this reason, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 3) rules that this prayer is not recited today.<br>", "After he - relieves himself, whether he defecated or urinated (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, in contrast to an opinion quoted by the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> which rules that the blessing which follows should be recited only after defecating).<br>", "comes out, he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who formed man in wisdom - See the <i>Targum Yonaton</i> to Ezekiel 28:12 which uses similar terms to praise the Divine wisdom manifest in the creation of the human body.<br>", "and created within him many openings and cavities. - e.g., the mouth, nose, anus.<br>", "It is revealed and known before the throne of Your glory that if one of them were to be blocked or if one of them were to be opened, it would be impossible to exist for even one moment - <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) quotes <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> (1:3) which states that unlike a manmade container which is unable to hold liquid when pierced by even the smallest pin, the body that God created is full of holes and cavities which open and close in a manner that allows man to continue to exist.<br>The <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> (<i>Shemini</i>) relates:<br>", "Happy are you, Israel!

This may explain the accepted order of the blessings in which \u05d0-\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05d4 (Halachah 3) is recited immediately after this blessing, \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e6\u05e8.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.6": ["When one fastens his belt, - The Rambam accepts the interpretation most commentaries have given to the words \u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e1\u05e8 in <i>Berachot</i> 60b, the source for this blessing. The Ra'avad interprets the Talmud as referring to putting on one's trousers.<br>", "he recites: [Blessed...universe], who girds Israel - The <i>Taz</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) points out that, of the morning blessings, only this and the blessing uttered after covering one's head (\u05e2\u05d5\u05d8\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05ea\u05e4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d4) mention Israel. The other blessings praise God for kindnesses enjoyed by all people. In contrast, these two blessings highlight actions performed by the Jewish people as an expression of modesty. The belt is intended to separate the heart from the lower half of the body (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:7 and 3:17). The covering of one's head signifies one's awareness of the Divine Presence, as stated above (See Halachah 4).<br>The <i>Avudraham</i> notes that this blessing is conceptually rooted in Jeremiah 12:11: \"'As a girdle clings to a man's loins so have I caused the whole of the House of Israel and the House of Judah to cleave unto Me,' says God; 'that they might be unto Me, a people, a name, a praise and a glory.'\u201d<br>", "with strength - The <i>Avodat Yitzchok</i> explains that a belt or girdle protects a person's body and affords him greater strength. Rav Asher of Lunil explains that this blessing refers to the spiritual strength granted to Israel through Torah study.<br>", "When he puts on his shoes, he recites: [Blessed...universe] for You have provided me - Our text follows the published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The same text is also quoted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher.<br>However, our text of <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this blessing, reads: \u05e9\u05e2\u05e9\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05db\u05dc \u05e6\u05e8\u05db\u05d9 - \"who provides me with all my needs\"; referring to God in the third person rather than in the second person. This version is found in most siddurim today. It is also found in the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and many Yemenite manuscripts.<br>", "with all my needs - Several different explanations are given for the association of this blessing with the putting on of one's shoes. The <i>Avudraham</i> states simply that a person is unable to move about freely without shoes. Therefore, putting on shoes enables him to acquire whatever he needs.<br>Rav Shlomo Kluger cites our Sages' statement, \"A person should sell everything he owns and buy shoes,\" as evidence that a person who has shoes to wear has acquired that which is most necessary.<br>The <i>Sh'loh</i> quotes the Maharshal as explaining the source for this blessing as Psalms 8:6-9.<br>You have made him [man] a little lower than angels.... You have given him dominion over the works of Your hands. You have put everything under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the sky and the fish of the seas.<br>Wearing leather shoes demonstrates the way in which the animal kingdom has been placed \"under man's feet\" and makes us aware that the dominion we have been granted over all creation allows us to acquire \"all our needs.\"<br>", "When he walks to depart on his way, he recites: - Our text of <i>Berachot</i> 60b and similarly, most contemporary siddurim, place this blessing before the previous one. Nevertheless, Rav Yitzchok Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher follow the same order as the Rambam.<br>", "[Blessed... universe] who prepares the steps of man - This blessing is based on Psalms 37:23: \"The steps of man are ordered by God\" and Proverbs 20:24: \"The steps of man are from God,\" both of which imply that in addition to giving man the ability to walk, God also guides the direction of his steps.<br>", "[Also,] every day, a person should recite: - Based on <i>Menachot</i> 43b, the following three blessings are recited daily as an expression of thanks for the renewal of our being. Some authorities require a person to have seen a gentile, woman, or slave before reciting the appropriate blessing. However, the Rambam maintains that the blessing should be recited each morning unconditionally (The Responsa of Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son).<br>", "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a non-Jew - We thank God for creating us with the opportunity to relate to Him through the Torah and mitzvot which were given only to the Jews.<br><i>Menachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) uses a positive statement for the formula of this blessing: \"Blessed... who has made me a Jew.\" Rabbenu Asher quotes this text. The Rambam's version is found in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 9:2. Rabbenu Yitzchok Alfasi also follows the Jerusalem Talmud.<br>The <i>Levush, Orach Chayim</i> 46, explains the reason for reciting the blessing in the negative: <i>Eruvin</i> 13a states that it would have been better for man not to have been created than to have been created (i.e., man's soul was in a higher state before its descent into the world than it is while in this world). Therefore, we do not express thanks for being created. Nevertheless, having been created, we thank God for not creating us as gentiles since gentiles have a far lesser number of commandments to fulfill.<br>The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> explains that the negative formula was chosen for the following reason. Our Sages required that we recite three blessings each morning. Torah law states that whenever a single blessing covers two different circumstances, the second blessing may not be recited. Therefore, since a statement thanking God \"for making me a Jew\" would make the blessing for \"not making me a servant\" superfluous, it is preferable to recite this blessing using the negative formula.<br>", "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a woman - A woman is not obligated to fulfill all the positive mitzvot whose performance is limited to a specific time. As a result, a man has many more mitzvot to fulfill and recites this blessing thanking God for that privilege.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) mentions that a woman should recite a blessing thanking God \"for making me according to His will.\"<br>", "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a servant - i.e., a Canaanite servant who is not a full member of the Jewish people (see <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 13:11). Like women, a Canaanite servant is exempt from all the positive mitzvot whose performance is limited to a specific time.<br>The published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and <i>Menachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) list these blessings in this order. However, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, and most siddurim today reverse the sequence of the last two blessings. This order reflects an ascending hierarchy, with women who are endowed with the holiness of the Jewish people, placed after servants.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.7": ["These eighteen blessings - Only seventeen blessings are recited in the morning. The eighteenth blessing is <i>hamapil</i>, the blessing recited before retiring at night. Nevertheless, as explained in the commentary to Halachah 3, the Rambam views it as connected to the morning blessings.<br>The eighteen blessings correspond to the eighteen blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and also to the number of times God's name is mentioned in Psalms 29, in the song sung by the Jewish People after the splitting of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19), and in the three sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. (See also our commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4.)<br>", "do not have a particular order - as might be inferred from the previous halachot. (The practice of reciting the blessings in a set order is discussed in Halachah 9.)<br>", "Rather, one recites each of them in response to the condition for which the blessing was instituted, at the appropriate time. - The Rambam's statements in this and the following two halachot are all based on the idea that these blessings are \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d0\u05d4 - \"blessings of thanks.\" Therefore, a person who does not receive the benefit associated with a particular blessing does not recite the blessing thanking God for that particular condition.<br>Rav Natrunai Gaon and Rav Amram Gaon differ with the Rambam. They consider these blessings to be \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05d1\u05d7 - \"blessings of praise\" for the goodness which God has granted the world as a whole and not thanks for benefit which one has derived as an individual. This opinion is accepted by the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) and other Ashkenazic halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Sephardic authorities accept the Rambam's view with certain reservations.<br>", "What is implied? - As the Rambam explained, each blessing is recited in response to a particular action generally carried out each morning. Therefore, should these actions be performed in a different order, the sequence of the blessings is changed correspondingly.<br>", "One who fastens his belt while still in his bed recites [the blessing] \"who girds Israel with strength\" - Although in Halachah 6, the Rambam stated that this blessing should be recited after one has gotten off his bed, if one fastens his belt while still in bed, he recites the appropriate blessing at that time.<br>", "One who hears the voice of the rooster recites [the blessing] \"who gives understanding to the rooster\" - This halachah is restated here as a prelude to the law that follows, i.e., that one not obligated in a blessing should not recite it. According to the Rambam, one who did not hear a rooster in the morning does not recite the blessing of \u05d4\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05df \u05dc\u05e9\u05db\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4.<br>", "Any blessing in which one is not obligated - because one has not personally derived the benefit associated with the mitzvah<br>", "should not be recited - As mentioned above, this is one of the differences between the Rambam's conception of the morning blessings and that of the other Geonim, who maintain that the blessings should be recited regardless. In consideration of the Rambam's position, the <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 46:8<i>)</i> suggests reciting the blessings without mentioning God's name. The Ramah maintains that one should follow the other opinion.<br>Even among those who accept the Rambam's conception of these blessings, some authorities would disagree regarding this particular blessing. With this blessing, we are not thanking God for hearing the rooster's crow itself, but for the benefit which we receive from the daylight which the rooster discerns. (See <i>Tosafot</i> and Rabbenu Asher, <i>Berachot</i> 60b.)<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.8": ["What is implied? - This halachah exemplifies the final principle mentioned in the previous halachah, that a person should not recite a blessing if he does not derive the benefit associated with it.<br>", "One who sleeps in his outer garment - in contrast to pajamas or underwear<br>", "should not recite the blessing \"who clothes the naked\" upon rising. - Since, though he is clothed, he performed the activity associated with the blessing on the previous day.<br>", "One who walks barefoot does not recite the blessing, \"for You have provided me with all my needs.\" - the blessing associated with wearing shoes.<br>On Yom Kippur and the ninth of Av, when one does not wash, - Washing is one of the five afflictions forbidden on these two days.

Rashi interprets this as \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4, the spirit of impurity which rests on our hands before the morning washing.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Yoma</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) rules that one does wash his hands upon rising in the morning on Yom Kippur since \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 is considered like any filth and may be removed in its normal fashion. As apparent from the previous halachot, the Rambam does not consider \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 as a significant factor and forbids such washing. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh, Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i>.)<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 613:2) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> opinion and states:<br>One washes his hands in the morning [on Yom Kippur] and recites \u05e2\u05dc \u05e0\u05d8\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd. One should be careful to wash only the ends of the joints of his fingers.<br>The Ramah adds: \"And he should not intend to enjoy the washing, and do so [only] to remove the \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 from his hands.\"<br>", "nor the blessing \"who removes the bonds of sleep...\" - which is associated with washing one's face. Since washing in this manner is prohibited on these days, one does not recite this blessing.<br>This ruling is also questioned by other halachic authorities. The Ra'avad states that since it is permissible to clean one's face if it is dirty, one may clean the dirt that collects in one's eyes overnight and recite the blessing associated with this washing.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 613:4 rules that one who is particularly fastidious may wash his face with water on the morning of Yom Kippur. The Ramah adds that the custom is to be very strict in this regard and not even to wash the eyes. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (basing himself on the <i>Bayit Chadash</i>) permits one to moisten his fingertips and clean the dirt from his eyes. All of these laws regarding Yom Kippur also apply to the ninth of Av.<br>One who does not relieve himself - in the morning.<br>", "does not recite the blessing, \"who created man in wisdom....\" - as part of the morning blessings.<br>", "The same applies regarding the remainder of the blessings. - Though Ashkenazic authorities do not accept the Rambam's ruling as explained above, we do find a law which parallels the Rambam's stance here. Even according to the Ashkenazic authorities, one should not recite the blessing \"who has provided me with all my needs\" on Yom Kippur or Tish'ah B'Av, since it is forbidden for everyone to wear shoes on these days.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.9": ["It is the custom of the people in the majority of our cities to recite these blessings one after another in the synagogue, whether or not they are obligated in them. - This practice has its source in the opinions of the other Geonim mentioned above. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) explains the custom:<br>Since one's hand are not clean [upon rising], the [rabbis] instituted the practice of reciting the [blessings] in order in the synagogue. [Another reason for the institution of this practice is that] many of the common people do not know how to recite the [blessings] and when they are recited in the synagogue, they can answer \"Amen\" afterwards, and thus, fulfill their obligation.<br>This is a mistake and it is not proper to follow this practice. One should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated to. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam sees two difficulties in this practice:a) The blessings are not recited at their proper time, i.e., immediately after the action to which they are a response;b) In the synagogue, all the blessings are recited and it is improper to recite a blessing that one is not obligated to recite.<br>In answer to the first objection, Rabbenu Asher and Rabbenu Yonah explain that there is no problem with reciting these blessings after the actions to which they relate have been completed. The only blessings that must be recited in direct conjunction with the deed with which they are associated are those recited before fulfilling commandments. However, blessings of thanks or praise may be uttered later. This opinion is accepted by all Ashkenazic authorities.<br>Today, many people recite these blessings at home after washing and dressing. In certain communities, they are recited communally in the synagogue. In all cases, however, each individual who is able to read the blessings from a siddur or knows them by heart should recite the blessings himself every morning.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.10": ["One who rises to study Torah, whether the Written or Oral Law, - There is debate in the Talmud about this matter. Some Sages did not require the recitation of a blessing for the study of certain portions of the Oral Law (See <i>Berachot</i> 11b). Nevertheless, the decision quoted by the Rambam is accepted by all halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:2 explains the reason for this decision, \"They [all portions of the Oral Law] are all Torah and were given to Moses at Mount Sinai.\"<br>", "before he recites the Shema, - <i>Berachot</i> 11b states:<br>Once one has recited the <i>Shema</i>, he need not recite a blessing [for Torah study] since he has fulfilled his obligation with <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> (the second blessing before the <i>Shema</i>).<br>This blessing praises God for teaching our ancestors \"the laws that bring eternal life\" and includes our prayers that He \"grant our hearts understanding... to learn and to teach... all the teachings of Your Torah.\" Therefore, <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> is considered as comparable\u00e1to the blessings recited before Torah study (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).<br>Rabbenu Asher quotes an opinion in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:1) which states that the blessing of <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> can replace the blessings before the study of the Torah only when one studies immediately after reciting the <i>Shema</i> and <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. The Ra'avad and the Rashba, however, maintain that the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> is also considered as Torah study. Therefore, if one recites the <i>Shema</i> after <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i>, one is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.<br>The Rambam appears to follow the latter opinion, however, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47:8) accepts Rabbenu Asher's view.<br>should wash his hands beforehand, - to fulfill the obligation of \u05e0\u05d8\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd upon rising in the morning.<br>", "recite [the following] three blessings, and then study. - Both here and in Halachah 11, the Rambam states that one must study immediately after reciting these blessings. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) explains the motivating principle: All blessings recited before the performance of a commandment must be followed immediately by the fulfillment of the commandment.<br>This position is, however, not universally accepted. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b), Rabbenu Yonah, and the Mordechai disagree and do not require the repetition of the blessings even if an interruption was made between their recitation and Torah study. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>,:9) warns against making such an interruption.<br>[The comparison of the blessings before Torah study to the blessings of the mitzvot is not universally accepted. In addition to the opinion of the Ramban mentioned in the following halachah, the <i>Levush</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) compares the blessings before Torah study to the blessings recited before partaking of food. Just as one thanks God for the satisfaction granted from food and other physical things, one blesses Him for the satisfaction derived from Torah study. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:1, <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> Vol. 14.]<br>", "[These blessings] are: [Blessed... universe] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the words of Torah. - There are two different versions of this blessing:a) one which has its source in the published text of the Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 11b, and concludes: \u05dc\u05e2\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d1\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 - \"to occupy [ourselves] in the words of Torah.\"b) the version quoted by the Rambam: \u05e2\u05dc \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 - \"concerning the words of Torah.\" This version is also found in the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon and the <i>Halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchok Alfasi.<br>The siddurim of the Sephardim, Yemenites and Nusach Ari follow the Rambam's text, whereas Nusach Ashkenaz reads \u05dc\u05e2\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d1\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4.[<br>In both versions, this blessing contains thirteen words corresponding to the thirteen principles of Biblical exegesis that apply to the Torah (\u05d9\u00ba\u05d2 \u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05ea \u05d1\u05d4\u05df, <i>Shulchan Tahor</i>).]<br>", "And - The presence here of the Hebrew letter <i>vav</i> (\u05d5) which is generally translated as \"and\" is the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) explains that, according to <i>Rabbenu Tam</i>, any blessing that follows another blessing of only a single line must itself begin \"Blessed are You...\" and cannot be included in the phrase \"Blessed are You...\" in the first blessing. Therefore, since this paragraph does not begin \"Blessed are You...,\" it appears to be a continuation of the first blessing and not a blessing of its own. The <i>vav</i> - \"and\" - indicates the connection between the two paragraphs.<br>The Rambam, however, clearly states that the second paragraph is considered as a blessing in its own right and not a continuation of the first blessing. The <i>vav</i> would, therefore, appear to be superfluous. Though most printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include a <i>vav</i>, the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Yemenite manuscripts, and the Ramah's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> all lack a <i>vav</i>. (Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:5, which explains that even according to the opinion that the second paragraph is a separate blessing, adding the <i>vav</i> is in place.)<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 47:6 rules that the <i>vav</i> should be recited. The Ramah adds that although the custom is not to say it, it should be said. Most siddurim of <i>Nusach Ashkenaz</i> and <i>Sefard</i> include the <i>vav</i>.<br>", "please, God, our Lord, make pleasant the words of Your Torah - We ask God to let us appreciate the sweetness of His Torah so that we will study it with love (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 11b).<br>", "in our mouths and in the mouths of Your people, the entire House of Israel. May we, our offspring, - The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> adds \"and our offsprings' offspring\" as a reference to the statement (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 85a) that the Torah will never depart from a family which has three generations of Torah scholars. However, this version is not included in many siddurim.<br>", "and the offspring of Your people, be knowers of Your name and among those who occupy themselves with Your Torah. Blessed are You, God, who teaches Torah to His people, Israel. - This version is found in the published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and the published texts of <i>Berachot</i> 11b, the source for this blessing. However, in his responsa, the Rambam suggests a different conclusion for this blessing: \"Blessed are You, God, the Giver of the Torah.\" He explains the reasons why he favors the latter version:<br>This [wording] alludes to our recognition that God gave us the Torah so that we will learn to do everything it states. [The blessing is a request] that He open our hearts to the study of Torah, for this was the reason it was given to us as a heritage.However, to conclude [the blessing with] \"who teaches Torah...\" is incorrect, for God... does not teach us the Torah. Though in His love for us, He separated us from the gentiles and gave us the Torah of truth, the actual performance of the mitzvah is left to us and doing His will is in our hands.<br>", "Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has chosen us from among all the nations and given us His Torah. - The designation of Israel as God's chosen people is associated with His giving them the Torah on Mount Sinai (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 47).<br>", "Blessed are You, God, who gives the Torah - <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) refers to this as \"the most exalted of these blessings\" because it contains thanks to God and praise of Israel and the Torah (Rashi).<br>Rabbenu Yonah points out that although this blessing follows directly after another blessing, it departs from the normal pattern of such blessings and begins \"Blessed are You....\" He explains that this is because this blessing is also often recited in isolation, before the reading of the Torah in the synagogue.<br>The recitation of the blessings of the Torah is very important. <i>Bava Metzia</i> 85a states that Eretz Yisrael was destroyed because the Jews forsook the Torah. Our Sages clarified that statement, explaining that it means that the people would study Torah without reciting the blessings before it. A person who studies Torah without reciting the blessings fails to realize its holiness and sanctity, therefore, it is considered as if he \"\"forsook the Torah.''<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.11": ["One is obligated to recite these three blessings - The nature of this obligation is debated among the commentaries. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) and others understand the Rambam as considering these blessings similar to any other blessing recited before the performance of a mitzvah and hence, of Rabbinic origin.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Berachot</i> 21a and <i>Yoma</i> 37a state that the obligation to recite a blessing on Torah study stems from the Torah itself. In keeping with this view, the Ramban (<i>Hosafot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, positive commandment 15) reckons the recitation of the blessings of the Torah as a separate mitzvah.<br>", "every day. - Perhaps with the words \"every day,\" the Rambam is implying that these blessings should be recited even if one does not sleep at night. See <i>Magen Avraham</i> 47:11.<br>The blessings are recited only once a day. In contrast to the blessings recited over other mitzvot, even if one interrupts his study and occupies himself with other matters, one need not recite a second blessing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 4:7 gives two reasons for this difference:1) The blessings before the Torah resemble the other morning blessings. A person enjoys the benefits associated with the morning blessings intermittently throughout the day, yet he only recites the blessings once in the morning. Similarly, though one may study at several different occasions in a single day, the blessings are recited only once daily.2) The obligation to study Torah is incumbent upon one throughout the entire day and, at all times, one's attention should be on one's studies.<br>", "Afterwards, one should read a few words of Torah. - If these blessings are comparable to other blessings recited before the performance of mitzvot, the mitzvah (studying Torah) must also be fulfilled immediately after the recitation of the blessing (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "[To fulfill this obligation,] the people adopted the custom of reading the Priestly Blessing. - The Priestly Blessing is found in Numbers 6:22-27. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b) also mentions the custom of reciting the Priestly Blessing each morning and Rav Amram Gaon includes the Priestly Blessing in his siddur.<br>The <i>Avudraham</i> mentions that the recitation of these verses arouses Divine blessing for the Jewish people. The <i>Even Yarchi</i> notes that the verses of the Priestly Blessing contain 60 letters, corresponding to the 60 tractates in the Talmud.<br>", "In certain places, they recite [the passage (Numbers 28:1-9)]: \"Command the children of Israel...,\" - These verses describe the morning sacrifice offered daily in the Holy Temple. The <i>Machzor Vitri</i> (an early siddur of French origin) does not include the Priestly Blessing and mentions these verses instead.<br>", "and there are places where they read both of them - In the Order of the Prayers for the Entire Year found at the conclusion of <i>Sefer Ahavah</i>, the Rambam includes both these passages, with the verses describing the sacrifices preceding the Priestly Blessings.<br>The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47:9) both understand the Priestly Blessing to be a fulfillment of the requirement to study Torah after the blessings. The verses of the Daily Sacrifice are recited later, with the intention that our recitation of these verses will compensate for our inability to actually offer these sacrifices (<i>Ta'anit</i> 27b, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 48).<br>", "Also, [it is proper] to read chapters or laws from the Mishnah and the Beraitot. - so that we will have studied passages from the written law, the Mishnah, and the Talmud and thus, emphasize how our obligation to study Torah applies to all three. Note <i>Kiddushin</i> 30a and <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:11, which advises one to divide his Torah study, a third in the Written Law, a third in Mishnah and a third in Talmud.<br>In his Order of Prayers, the Rambam lists the following passages from the oral law after the the Priestly Blessings:<br>These are the precepts for which no fixed limit is prescribed: <i>Pe'ah</i> (the corners of the field left unharvested for the needy, Leviticus 23:22 , <i>Bikkurim</i> (the first fruits, Exodus 23:19 , <i>HaRei'on</i> (the pilgrimage offerings, Deuteronomy 16:16-17), acts of kindness and the study of Torah. [A Mishnah, <i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1.]These are the precepts, the fruits of which a person enjoys in this world, while the principle remains [for him] in the world to come: Honoring one's mother and father, acts of kindness, concentration during prayer, visiting the sick, waking early to go to the study hall, hospitality to guests, bringing peace between man and his fellow man, and the study of Torah, which is equivalent to them all. [A <i>beraita</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 127a]Rav Zeira says: \"Jewish women imposed a stringent practice upon themselves. Even if they saw a drop of [vaginal] blood the size of a mustard seed, they would count seven clean days after it.\" [An example of Torah law, <i>Berachot</i> 31a, <i>Nidah</i> 66a, and <i>Megillah</i> 28b]It was taught in the School of Elijah: Whoever studies Torah law every day is assured of life in the world to come [as implied by Chabakuk 3:6]: \"<i>Halichot</i> (the paths of) the world are his.\" Do not read <i>halichot</i>, but <i>halachot</i> (Torah laws) [<i>Megillah</i> 28b].Rabbi Eliezer said in the name of Rabbi Chanina: Torah scholars increase peace in the world as [implied by Isaiah 54:13]: \"And all your children will be students of God and great will be the peace of your children.\" [<i>Berachot</i> 64a.]<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.12": ["The Sages praised - Rav Kapach notes that at the beginning of this chapter, the Rambam attributes the order of the prayers to the <i>Anshei K'nesset HaGedolah</i>. Therefore, we can assume that they also instituted the practice of reciting verses of praise before the blessings of the <i>Shema</i>. (Note the statement of Rabbi Simlai, <i>Berachot</i> 32a, which suggests praising God before reciting the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.) Though from the passage from <i>Shabbat</i> quoted below one might infer that the recitation of these verses was instituted later, perhaps this refers to the designation of the specific verses to be recited, while the practice of reciting verses itself had already existed.<br>", "those who recite songs from the Book of Psalms every day; from \"A song of praise by David... (Tehillah l'David)\" (Psalms 145) - <i>Berachot</i> 4b states that anyone who recites Psalms 145 three times each day is guaranteed a place in the World to Come.<br>", "until the end of the Book [of Psalms] - <i>Shabbat</i> 118b relates:<br>Rabbi Yossi said: \"May my portion be with those who complete [the recitation of] <i>Hallel</i> every day.\"That cannot be. Behold, the master taught that one who recites <i>Hallel</i> every day is considered as a blasphemer and abuser.In regard to what did [Rabbi Yossi] make his statement? In regard to \u05e4\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d3\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05d0 - the verses of song.<br>The Rambam understands \u05e4\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d3\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05d0 as referring to the last six chapters of Psalms (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). This definition is also accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher.<br>", "It has become customary to read verses before and after them - In his Order of Prayers for the Entire Year, the Rambam mentions a series of verses from Psalms and from I Chronicles 29:10-14 which are recited before and after these six Psalms. See <i>Soferim</i> 17:11. These verses are customarily recited today in both Ashkenazic and Sephardic communities.<br>They instituted a blessing before the [recitation of the] songs, Baruch She'amar..., - Tradition states that the <i>Anshei K'nesset HaGedolah</i> received this blessing and the blessing,<i>Yishtabach</i>, from Heaven. Therefore, our custom is to recite these blessings standing (<i>Or Zerua</i>).<br>The <i>Pri Chadash</i> takes issue with this view and maintains that these blessings were instituted by the <i>Geonim</i> after the conclusion of the Talmud. Though the <i>Or Zerua's</i> opinion is based only on \"tradition,\" the fact that the Jerusalem Talmud refers to these blessings, as mentioned below, indicates that they were recited during the Talmudic era.<br>", "and a blessing after [concluding] them, Yishtabach. - The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> explain that the blessings, <i>Baruch She'amar</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> are considered a single unit. Therefore, <i>Yishtabach</i> is considered a blessing which follows directly after another blessing - despite the verses recited between the two blessings. Accordingly, it does not begin \"Blessed are You, God....\"<br>Though the verses of \u05e4\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d3\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05d0 are not considered an interruption between the blessings, idle conversation certainly would be. Thus, the Jerusalem Talmud rules that anyone who talks between <i>Baruch She'amar</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> has transgressed and is not fit to be part of the Jewish army (which must be composed only of righteous men).<br>", "Afterwards, one recites the blessings for Kri'at Shema and recites the Shema - See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:5-8.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.13": ["There are places where they are accustomed to recite the Song of the Sea (Exodus 14:30-15:26) each day - The <i>Zohar</i> (II:54b) states that anyone who recites this song at present will merit to recite it in the Messianic age.<br>See also the <i>Tosefta, Berachot</i> (2:1) and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 66:4 which emphasize (albeit in a different context) that the obligation to recall the exodus from Egypt each day should also include the recollection of the miracle of the splitting of the sea.<br>", "after they recite Yishtabach. - In his siddur, Rav Sa'adia Gaon writes that \"though this is a fine custom, it is not obligatory or necessary.\"<br>", "Afterwards, they recite the blessings for the Shema - It is improper to make an interruption between <i>Yishtabach</i> and the blessings of the <i>Shema</i>. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 54:3) However, verses of praise and prayer are not considered an interruption. Note the custom of reciting <i>Shir hama'alot</i> at this point in prayer during the Ten Days of Repentance.<br>Today, we recite the Song of the Sea before <i>Yishtabach</i>. <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> suggests that this is because it is also praise of God and thus, is appropriate within the context of \u05e4\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d3\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05d0.<br>", "There are places where they recite the song of Ha'azinu (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) - <i>Ha'azinu</i> is also a song of general relevance. The Maggid of Meseritch advised reciting it daily as a means of evoking Divine blessing.<br>Among Sephardic Jews, there is a custom to recite <i>Ha'azinu</i> in place of the Song of the Sea on the Tish'ah b'Av because of the verses of reproof contained in it (<i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>).<br>", "and there are individuals who recite both of them.

In this halachah, the Rambam explains the reason for Rabbi Abahu's action.<br>The Rambam's statements are accepted by Rabbenu Asher, Rabbenu Nissim, and most other authorities. Nevertheless, it is significant that Rav Hai Gaon, one of the major authorities who preceded the Rambam, offers a different explanation for Rabbi Abahu's actions.<br>Rav Hai Gaon maintains that it is impossible that a doubt existed among the Jewish people concerning such an important manner as sounding the shofar. Since the shofar was sounded each year, surely the tradition could have been maintained. Hence, he explains that all the different manners of sounding the shofar were acceptable and that Rabbi Abahu's contribution was the establishment of a uniform custom that included all the different practices common among the Jewish people. By mentioning the \"many years\" and \"exiles,\" the Rambam addresses himself to the question raised by Rav Hai Gaon.<br>", "Does it resemble the wailing with which the women cry - thus, it would be short, staccato sounds like sobs<br>", "when they moan - The word <i>teru'ah</i> is translated into Aramaic as <i>yevavah</i> (moan), as in Judges 5:28: \"Sisra's mother gazed out the window and moaned through the lattice.\"<br>", "or - does a <i>teru'ah</i> resemble...<br>", "the sighs - i.e., longer sounds<br>", "which a person who is distressed about a major matter will release repeatedly? - Since before a person cries, he sighs (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b).<br>", "Perhaps a combination of the two - sighing and the crying which will follow it - is called teru'ah, because a distressed person will sigh and then cry.

On Rosh Hashanah, a Jew must concentrate on the coronation of God as King of the world.

One of the fundamental texts of the period directly following the conclusion of the Talmud, the <i>Sh'eltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon (note 171), mentions a different practice.<br>Three series of blasts from each pattern are not blown directly after each other. Rather, after sounding three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i>, three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>, and then three series of <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> is sounded.<br>", "[Then,] he sounds a teki'ah; afterwards, three shevarim; and afterwards, a teki'ah. - in accordance with the opinion that maintains that a <i>teru'ah</i> resembles sighing.

From this, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> derives a halachic insight, maintaining that according to the Rambam, one may take a breath between the two. (The <i>Mayim Chayim</i> supports this conclusion, noting that, regarding this series, the Rambam states that one should blow \"three <i>shevarim</i>, and afterwards, a <i>teru'ah</i>.\") Nevertheless, the Ramban and other authorities do not permit this leniency.<br>Regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 590:4) suggests adhering to the more stringent view regarding the <i>teki'ot</i> required by Torah law.

Hence, according to the Rambam, the length of the <i>teki'ot</i> are dependent on the length of the <i>teru'ot</i>.<br>Rabbenu Nissim objects to the Rambam's interpretation, explaining that the word \u05d5\u05d4\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea, the verb mentioned in the commandment to blow the shofar, implies a long blast, and hence the measure mentioned by the Rambam would not be appropriate.<br>Similarly, the Ra'avad does not accept the Rambam's interpretation, and explains that the Mishnah establishes an independent measure for the length of a <i>teki'ah</i> - three <i>teru'ot</i> - with each <i>teru'ah</i> being equal to three short sobs. Thus, the measure of a <i>teki'ah</i> is equivalent to nine short sounds. The Ramban and the Rashba also subscribe to this view.<br>Rashi and most Ashkenazic authorities accept the simple meaning of the Mishnah and explain that a <i>teki'ah</i> is equal to the length of a <i>teru'ah</i>. However, as explained in the previous halachot, there are three different interpretations of the definition of a <i>teru'ah</i>. Thus, the required length for the <i>teki'ah</i> varies accordingly.<br>Regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 590:3) mentions the views of Rashi and the Ra'avad, but not that of the Rambam.<br>", "The required length of the three shevarim is that of a teru'ah. - i.e., the length of the three <i>shevarim</i> should resemble a series of <i>teru'ot</i>.<br>", "When a person sounds a teki'ah and a teru'ah, and afterwards sounds a long teki'ah, extending it twice the length of the original one - with the intention that it be considered to be the final blast of the first series and the initial blast of the following series<br>", "we do not say that it may be considered to be two teki'ot - although it is of sufficient length<br>", "thus allowing one [to complete the series merely by] sounding a teru'ah and another teki'ah. - This represents a rephrasing of the Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:9 and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a.<br>", "Rather, even if one extended a teki'ah the entire day, it is considered to be only a single teki'ah - This decision runs contrary to the statements of the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 3:3), which does not accept a <i>teki'ah</i> blown with such an intention at all.<br>", "and one must sound another teki'ah, teru'ah, and teki'ah [until he completes] three series. - This law is quoted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 590:6).

Furthermore, the <i>Tosefta</i> 2:12 states specifically that one does fulfill one's obligation in this manner.<br><i>Tosafot</i> disagrees with Rashi, mentioning the second reason stated by Rabbenu Manoach.

Nevertheless, if a person knows how to sound both <i>teki'ot</i> and <i>shevarim</i>, he should sound three series of such blasts even if he does not know how to sound a <i>teru'ah</i>. Since it is possible that the mitzvah may be fulfilled by these series (as explained in Halachot 2 and 3), at the very least they should be sounded (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 593:2).<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.7": ["The congregation - but not an individual (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34b)<br>", "is obligated to hear the shofar blasts - i.e., the nine blasts mentioned in Halachah 1<br>", "together with the order of blessings. - <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16b explains that the Sages instituted the blowing of the shofar in the midst of the prayer service in order to confuse Satan, lest he lodge accusations against the Jews in the midst of their prayers. The Sages explain (ibid., 32b) that it would have been appropriate to institute the shofar blowing in the morning service. However, the Romans desired to stamp out the performance of the mitzvot and sent guards to make sure that the mitzvah was not fulfilled. After midday, the guards left, and then, in the musaf service, the shofar would be sounded.<br>Originally, the Sages' decree involved determining the place of the service when the mitzvah required by the Torah would be fulfilled and this halachah must be interpreted in that context. However, as explained in Halachot 11 and 12, it became universally accepted Jewish custom to blow the shofar before the musaf prayers to fulfill the Torah's commandment, and thus \"confuse the Satan\" even before the beginning of our prayers, and then to sound the shofar again in the midst of those prayers to fulfill the Rabbinic decree.

In the previous clause, he stated that one must recite three verses - one from the Torah, one from the prophets, and one from the writings - to fulfill one's obligation, while this clause implies that the recitation of one is sufficient.<br>The source for the difficulty is the following quotes: The Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a, states:One should not recite fewer than ten verses for <i>Malchuyot</i>, ten for <i>Zichronot</i>, and ten for <i>Shofarot</i>. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says: \"If one recites three - three of each - one fulfills his obligation.\"<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 35a quotes Rav Chanan'el as saying in the name of Rav:Even if he states: \"In Your Torah, it is written...\" [and recites one verse], nothing further is necessary.From the Talmud, it appears that both these statements are accepted as halachah. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam interprets Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri's requirement of three verses as the total for all three blessings. Thus, for each blessing, one must state \"In Your Torah, it is written...\" and recite a single appropriate verse. [This surely differs from the Rambam's statements in his commentary on the Mishnah.]<br>The Ramban, Rabbenu Nissim, and others explain that Rav Chanan'el agrees with Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri and thus, in addition to \"In Your Torah, it is written...,\" he also requires one to say: \"In Your holy writings, it is recorded...,\" and: \"by your prophets, it was proclaimed...,\" mentioning an appropriate verse in each instance. (This opinion is quoted by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 586:8 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 591:11.)<br>Alternatively, one may explain the Rambam's position as follows: Ideally, one should recite ten verses for each blessing; after the fact, three are sufficient, as stated by Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri. When does this apply? Once one has recited at least one verse from the Torah. However, if one has not recited any verses, it is sufficient to say \"In Your Torah, it is written...\" and recite a single verse from the Torah, as Rav Chanan'el said in the name of Rav.<br>The flexibility regarding the number of quotes in each blessing was only granted in the previous generations. Since at present we have adopted a standard set of blessings, a person should not delete verses at will (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 591:6; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 591:8).<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.9": ["One should not recite [verses for] Malchuyot, Zichronot, and Shofarot which describe [Divine] retribution - Since Rosh Hashanah is a day of judgement, we are careful not to mention any factors that might lead to negative repercussions.

The Talmud objects to this verse because it is of an individual nature. Though it continues to resolve that difficulty, explaining that God's granting providence to Sarah effected the future of the entire Jewish people, the Rambam nevertheless avoided the problem by choosing the verse which is clearly of general import.<br>", "may not be included as Zichronot. - The meaning of \u05e4\u05e7\u05d3 is often \"remember.\" Indeed, the Targum of the cited verse in Genesis is \u05d3\u05db\u05d9\u05e8, the Aramaic for \"remembered.\" Furthermore, the Talmud mentions that Rabbi Yosse allowed verses using the verb \u05e4\u05e7\u05d3, and although Rabbi Yehudah objected, in differences of opinion between the two, Rabbi Yosse's position is generally favored. Nevertheless, since there are many verses that use the verb \u05d6\u05db\u05e8, there is no difficulty in establishing a practice that will be accepted by all opinions (<i>Beit Yosef</i> 591).<br>", "One may mention verses that refer to retribution to be visited upon the gentile nations - for example, [Psalms 99:1]: \"God is King, the nations will tremble...\"; [Psalms 137:7]: \"Remember, O God, against the Edomites, the day of Jerusalem\"; [Zechariah 9:14]: \"God, the Lord, will sound the shofar and proceed in a southerly storm-wind.\" - Despite this decision, only the latter verse is included in the text of the blessings we recite on Rosh Hashanah.<br>", "All the following verses: [Deuteronomy 6:4]: \"Hear Israel, God is our God, God is one\"; [Deuteronomy 4:35]: \"To you, it has been revealed that you may know...\"; and [Deuteronomy 4:39]: \"And you shall know today and draw it close to your heart...\" express the concept of God's sovereignty. - These verses all express the oneness of God and creation; thus they emphasize how \"He is unique and one, with none that compare to Him.

Though the Rambam accepts the principle that Moses served the people as a king (see <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:11), he does not necessarily view this verse as the source for that concept.<br>The verses which have been accepted in the standard text for these blessings are as follows:<br><i>MALCHUYOT</i><br>TorahAnd you shall know today and draw it close to your heart that God is the Lord in the heavens above and the earth below.

Indeed, we find the Hebrew, <i>chanut</i>, used to refer to a place of eating in <i>Bava Metzia</i> 83b.<br>", "or in the marketplace, - Though the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ma'aserot</i> 3:2 mentions this prohibition in reference to a Torah Sage, the Babylonian Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 40b condemns even a common person for such behavior, stating: \"Whoever eats in the marketplace is like a dog.\" The passage in <i>Kiddushin</i> continues to explain that such a person is unacceptable as a witness and the Rambam quotes that law (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 11:5).<br>The commentaries have attempted to resolve this difficulty in different ways: For example <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> (ibid.) explains that a common person is condemned only if he eats a full meal in the market place, while a wise man should not eat anything at all in public. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot Edut</i>) differentiates between eating in a crowded place - which is forbidden for everyone - and eating in a quiet corner - which is deemed improper only for a Sage. The <i>Bach</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 34) explains that a common person is censored only for eating while walking through the market place, while the wise man should not eat in public even while standing in one place.<br>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in this halachah, the Rambam uses the expression <i>chacham</i> (a wise man), his ideal for a person with a developed personality, and not <i>talmid chacham</i> (a Torah Sage). Apparently, he does not differentiate between a Torah Sage and a common person in this matter and requires a refined, highly developed standard in meeting our physical needs from everyone.<br>", "unless there is a very pressing need, lest he be viewed without respect by others.", "He should not eat together with the unlearned, - <i>Sanhedrin</i> 52b states that, at the outset, a common person will consider a Torah Sage to be like a vessel of gold. However, if the Sage derives benefit from the common person, he will come to regard the Sage like an earthenware shard.<br>Note <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11, where the Rambam equates the dining of a learned and pious man together with the unlearned with the desecration of the Name of God. See also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> (25:4) where he rules that communal leaders and judges should not eat and drink with the common people.<br>", "nor at those tables that are \"filled with vomit and excrement.\" - This expression is obviously a reference to <i>Avot</i> 3:3:<br>[When] three eat at one table and do not speak words of Torah there, it is as if they eat from sacrifices to the dead [i.e., idols] as [Isaiah 28:8] states: \"For all tables are full of vomit and excrement; there is no room.\"<br>In his commentary to this mishnah, the Rambam writes:<br>Previously, the verse dealt with eating and drinking while forsaking the Torah and those who study it. Therefore, all of these tables are considered as if excrement and filth; i.e., the foods of idol worship, are eaten upon them.<br>Furthermore,...<br>", "He - the wise man<br>", "should not eat frequently in other places, - outside his own home; i.e., the wise man, even when he eats in a private home and in the proper company, should limit the number of homes that he frequents (<i>Pesachim</i> 49a).<br>", "even in the company of wise men, nor should he eat where there is a large gathering. - The reason for these restrictions is, as the Rambam expresses in the Guide to the Perplexed (ibid.), a basic desire for a person, particularly when he relates to others, to emphasize the refined and developed aspects of his being and not those which he shares with other animals. Therefore, even when there is no danger of subjecting himself to undesirable influences or disgracing the Torah with which he is identified, he should refrain from performing a physical activity like eating in the presence of others.<br>", "It is not fitting for him to eat at another person's [table] except at a feast associated with a mitzvah, - <i>Chullin</i> 95b states that Rav would not partake of a meal in public unless it was associated with a mitzvah.<br>", "e.g., a betrothal - This decision is not accepted by all authorities. Some do not consider such a betrothal feast as \"associated with a mitzvah.\"<br><i>Erusin</i> translated as \"betrothal,\" refers to the first stage of the marriage process, i.e., giving the woman the wedding ring. In Talmudic and post-Talmudic times, this ceremony was carried out before the actual wedding (<i>nisuin</i>). At present, we perform the two stages of the wedding, <i>erusin</i> and <i>nisuin</i> together. Thus, reference to what we term engagement as <i>erusin</i> is technically a misnomer.<br>", "or wedding feast - and then, [only] when a scholar is marrying the daughter of a scholar. - <i>Pesachim</i> 49a mentions that weddings between scholars and common people are undesirable and should not be attended by a Torah Sage (<i>Avodat HaMelech</i>). The Rambam also deals with this subject in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>, Chapter 21.<br>", "The righteous and the pious of old never partook of a meal that was not their own. - <i>Chullin</i> 7b relates that even when Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi invited Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair to a meal, the latter Sage refused. Note also the Rambam's comments at the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Zechiah U'Matanah</i>.<br>"], "Human Dispositions 5.3": ["Whoever becomes drunk is a sinner, - The commentaries cite <i>Berachot</i> 29b: \"Do not become drunk and do not sin;\" a passage which seems to say that drink leads to sins. There is room for question for it appears that the Rambam views drinking itself as sinful.<br>", "is shameful, - In the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 8, the Rambam castigates drunken revelry in the harshest terms:<br>A drinking party is more shameful than a gathering of naked people [who] defecate together in daylight in one place. Elimination is a necessary human function. However, drunkenness is the voluntary act of the wicked man.<br>", "and will lose his wisdom. - See Proverbs 31:5: \"Lest he drink and forget the Law and pervert the judgement of all the poor.\"<br>The Torah gives examples of the degrading effects of drunkenness (Noah, Genesis, Chapter 8; Lot, Genesis, Chapter 19). There are specific prohibitions against drinking - e.g. a priest is not allowed to perform the priestly services while under the influence of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9-11). Similarly, numerous passages throughout the Prophets and Sacred Writings castigate drunkenness. These are also paralleled in the rabbinic literature, e.g. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 70a, <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 12.<br>", "If he becomes drunk before the common people, he desecrates God's Name. - Note the Rambam's remarks in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 25:4:<br>When a person is given a position of authority over the community... most certainly [he is forbidden] to eat and drink and become drunk in public and in a gathering of the ignorant or at a repast of friends.Woe to those judges who act with such affront to the Torah of Moses, who disgrace its laws and reduce it to the earth, bring it down to the dust and cause evil to themselves and their descendants in this world and the next.<br>Most commentaries cite <i>Pesachim</i> 49a as the source for the Rambam's statement, however, that passage does not mention intoxication. The <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. I, 110a, specifically associates drunkenness with the desecration of God's name.<br>Since intoxication is such an undesirable state...<br>", "It is forbidden to drink even a small quantity of wine - Note <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:17 which considers a <i>revi'it</i> (between 3 and 5 oz.) of wine as slightly intoxicating. Since our wines are considerably weaker than those of the Rambam's time, it is questionable whether this measure would apply today.<br>", "in the afternoon hours, - <i>Avot</i> 3:13 mentions wine that is drunken in the afternoon as one of four things which \"remove a person from the world.\" <i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i>, Chapter 21, explains that drinking wine in the afternoon causes a person to \"negate the entire Torah.\"<br>", "unless it is taken together with food because drink that is taken together with food is not intoxicating - to the same degree as wine that is drunk without food. See the Rambam's commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:6.<br>", "Only wine that is taken after the meal is to be avoided."], "Human Dispositions 5.4": ["it is fitting that a wise man behave with holiness. - Though a Jew's commitment to holiness must encompass every aspect of his behavior, the Torah and our Sages have always emphasized the importance of this quality in regard to sexuality. There is no more powerful expression of man's basic, instinctual nature than sex. Therefore, precisely in this area, a Jew must reveal that his nature is not only material, that he possesses a spiritual dimension that lies at the core of his being and seeks expression.<br>For this reason, the Jewish marriage bond is referred to as <i>Kiddushin</i>, emphasizing how <i>kedushah</i>, holiness, is a fundamental element in marriage. Similarly, Leviticus 20:7, proclaims \"Sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am God, your Lord,\" as a preface to the laws proscribing forbidden intimate relations. <i>Sh'vuot</i> 18b interprets the above verse as also including a command to conduct oneself in a holy manner within permitted relationships.<br>The quality of holiness involves not only restraint, as mentioned in the ensuing statements, but also the manner in which relations are carried out. The Rambam elaborates on this aspect in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:9 and in his commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4.<br>", "He should not frequent his wife like a rooster. - The rooster is a widely used symbol of lust. The phrase used by the Rambam is quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 22a. See also <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:5.<br>In <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:11, the Rambam also elaborates on this matter, calling frequent intimate relations a severe blemish and boorish behavior which was frowned upon by the Sages.<br>", "Rather, [he should limit his relations to once a week] - <i>Ketubot</i> 62a,b describes the frequency with which people involved in different occupations should engage in intimate relations (See also <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 14:1-4.). The measure given here is the one allotted to Torah Sages.<br>", "from Sabbath evening to Sabbath evening, - <i>Ketubot</i> (ibid.) states that Psalms 1:3: \"It brings forth its fruit in its season\" applies to such a person.<br>[The commentaries note the continuation of the verse, \"Its leaves will not wither\", and interpret it as implying that the draining of physical energy caused by intimate relations which the Rambam described in Chapter 4, Halachah 21, will not occur when a person follows this schedule.]<br>", "<i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> (attributed to the Ramban) emphasizes that on the Sabbath, a person is granted a greater spiritual potential which enables him to maintain his bond with God even when involved in physical activities.", "if he has the physical stamina. - See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 14, where the Rambam prescribes criteria for the frequency of intimate relations that are coordinated with a person's physical stamina.<br>When he speaks - The Rambam quotes this euphemism for intimate relations from <i>Nedarim</i> 20b.<br>", "with her, he should not do so at the beginning of the night, when he is sated and his belly [is] full, nor at the end of the night, when he is hungry; rather, in the middle of the night, when his food has been digested. - Note Chapter 4, Halachah 19. <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> explains that both during the time food is being digested and when a person is hungry, his emotional balance is somewhat disturbed and it is difficult for him to develop the proper attitude and spiritual awareness necessary to make intimate relations a Godly act.<br><i>Nedarim</i> 20b emphasizes that the midnight hour also allows a person to rest from all his worldly involvement. The quiet of the hour prevents him from being disturbed by other thoughts and he is able to concentrate on his wife alone.<br>Despite the advantages of having relations at midnight, many contemporary authorities suggest that a couple not hold to this as a binding rule. If a couple have already begun thinking of sex, they should not be forced to wait until midnight to fulfill their desires.<br>He should not be excessively lightheaded, - Previously (Chapter 2, Halachah 7), the Rambam cited a mishnah (<i>Avot</i> 3:16) which links lightheadedness and immorality.<br>", "nor should he talk obscene nonsense even in intimate conversation with his wife. - Though a man should talk to his wife to prepare her for intimacy, he must be careful of what he says. Note the comments of <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 24:7.<br>\"And your camp shall be holy, that He see no lewd things in you\" (Deuteronomy 23:15 . The latter refers to unseemly speech. Rav Shmuel bar Nachman said: Lewd speech is obscenity.<br>", "Behold, the prophet has stated (<i>Amos</i> 4:13): \"And He tells over to a man what he has spoken.\" [On this verse,] our Sages - <i>Chagigah</i> 5b<br>", "commented: A person will have to account - when being judged in the afterworld...<br>", "for even the light conversation that he has with his wife. - for every aspect of a man's behavior is significant.<br>", "[At the time of relations,] they should not be drunk, - For intimate relations to be a meaningful act, each of the partners must have all his faculties at his command.<br>As mentioned in the following halachah, a proper attitude toward intimate relations will cause one to father children who are refined and attractive. The converse is also true. If parents engage in intimate relations in a coarse manner or if there is friction and lack of harmony between them, the children born of their union will have undesirable character traits.<br>In particular, <i>Nedarim</i> 20b describes ten situations in which relations are forbidden and states that the children born of such unions are endowed with extremely negative tendencies. One of the undesirable states at the time of relations is drunkenness. See also the following halachah and <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:12.<br>", "nor lackadaisical, - People should not engage in relations except when motivated by desire (preferably a holy desire as explained in Chapter 3). For this reason, as mentioned below, a husband should spend time arousing his wife's desires.<br>", "nor tense - Some manuscripts have <i>atzubim</i>- \"depressed\" - instead. Neither state of mind conforms to the attitude desired by the Torah as mentioned below.<br>", "[neither both of them,] or [even] one of them. - The act of intimacy should be a true union between man and wife.

During intimacy, he uncovers a handbreadth and covers a handbreadth (i.e., engages in intimacy modestly) and it appears that a demon is pressuring him\" (i.e., he would withdraw after completing the act of intimacy).<br>"], "Human Dispositions 5.5": ["Whoever conducts himself in this manner [may be assured that] not only does he sanctify his soul, purify himself, and refine his character, but, furthermore, - in addition to these spiritual and ethical benefits,...<br>", "if he has children, - The Rambam does not promise that children will be conceived. However, if conception takes place,...<br>", "they - the offspring<br>", "will be handsome - Note the passage from <i>Nedarim</i> quoted in the previous halachah.<br>", "and modest, worthy of wisdom and piety. - <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> states:<br>When a person joins together with his wife while his thoughts cleave to the spiritual realms, those thoughts draw down a sublime light which rests on that drop of semen... Thus, that drop of semen is always connected to that shining light.This is the mystic secret implied in [God's words to the prophet, Jeremiah   1:5 ]: \"Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you;\" i.e., He had already established a connection of shining light with the sperm [from which] that Tzaddik [was conceived] at the time of [his parents'] union.<br>", "[In contrast,] whoever conducts himself in the ways of the rest of the people who walk in darkness - The latter phrase is borrowed, out of context, from Isaiah 9:1.<br>", "will have children like those people. - The effect of improper intimate behavior on offspring is mentioned in <i>Nedarim</i> 20b and <i>Eruvin</i> 100b. Note our comments in the previous halachah. See, too, <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:12.<br>"], "Human Dispositions 5.6": ["Torah Sages conduct themselves with exceptional modesty. - With this statement, the Rambam establishes a connection with the previous halachah and sets the motif for what follows. Modesty is not simply a matter of dress, (this is discussed in halachah 9), but rather, an awareness of God which causes a person to cover head and body out of respect for the Divine Presence. The Rambam expands upon this concept in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Vol. III, Chapter 52):<br>He is constantly with us, observing us, as [Jeremiah 23:24] proclaims: 'Can a man hide himself in the secret places and I not see him,' says God.\" Understand this well.Know that when perfect men comprehend this, they achieve such humility, such awe and fear of God and a sense of shame before Him... that their private behavior with their wives and in latrines is like their public conduct with other people.Know that they have forbidden a man to walk with an erect carriage, because: \"the entire world is filled with His glory\" (Isaiah 6:3 ... We are always in His presence... Thus, the greatest among the Sages found it difficult to bare their heads because the Divine Presence constantly hovers over man.<br>", "They do not demean themselves and do not bare their heads, - <i>Kiddushin</i> 30a relates that Rabbi Chiya bar Abba once saw Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi taking his son to school while wearing a makeshift hat. When Rabbi Chiya asked him the reason he was wearing such a head-covering, he explained that he was forced to leave his home in a hurry and was not able to arrange his turban. Nevertheless, he found it preferable to wear even a makeshift head-covering, rather than go out bareheaded.<br><i>Kiddushin</i> 31a quotes Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yeshoshua, as explaining that he would not walk four cubits bareheaded out of respect for \"the Divine Presence which is above my head.\" (See also <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. III, p. 245b.) Similarly, <i>Shabbat</i> 156b relates that an astrologer told Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak's mother that he was destined to be a thief. From his earliest childhood, she trained him to avoid this fate. She would constantly tell him to cover his head \"so that the fear of God will be upon you.\"<br>", "or their bodies. - The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (2:1) lays down the following general rule: Any portion of our bodies which is usually covered should not be revealed unless there is a specific reason for doing so.<br>Modesty, as understood in the present context, results from the awareness of the Divine Presence. The ordinary man experiences such awareness while at prayer when \"he is as if standing before the Divine Presence\" (<i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:16) and then he is required not to bare his head (ibid. 5:5) or various parts of his body; e.g., his chest (ibid. 4:7) and his feet (ibid. 5:5). As emphasized in Chapter 3, Halachah 3, a wise man should try to be conscious of the Divine Presence at all times and places. As a result, he will constantly be modest.<br>Though in Talmudic times and in the Rambam's era, personal modesty and covering one's head were considered the signs of a Sage (<i>Kiddushin</i> 8a) and a unique and special merit (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b), at present, both practices have been accepted as ordinary behavior for all observant Jews.<br>Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. - <i>Tamid</i> 27b quotes Rav as giving his son the following advice: \"Sit and reveal yourself. Cover yourself and stand.\"<br>", "He should not wipe himself clean with the right hand. - Since the right hand is used to tie <i>Tefillin</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 62a) and is given priority over the left hand regarding service in the Temple (<i>Zevachim</i> 24a), the installation ceremony of priests (Leviticus 8:23 , and other ritual manners, it is not proper that it be used for this function.<br>Many authorities maintain that this restriction only applies when one is cleaning oneself with one's hand alone, but not when one uses toilet paper.<br>", "He should stay away from all others and enter a chamber beyond a chamber, a cave within a cave, and relieve himself. - <i>Berachot</i> 62b derives this law from I Samuel 24:3's description of the behavior of King Saul. Though it is forbidden to delay relieving oneself (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:31), our Sages did not give this prohibition precedence over the dictates of modesty (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 3:11).<br>", "If - no latrine is available and<br>", "he [must] relieve himself - These restrictions only apply to defecation. The Sages feared that refraining from urination might be damaging (<i>Bechorot</i> 44b).<br>", "behind a fence, he should move far enough away that no one can hear the sound if he breaks wind. - I.e., even though an observer might see that he is squatting and thus, conclude that he is defecating, since the fence covers his lower body, there is no difficulty (<i>Berachot</i> 62a).<br>", "If he [must] relieve himself in an open area, - where such a barrier is not available<br>", "he should be far enough off so that no one can see him baring himself. - i.e., though the ultimate reason for modesty is the awareness of God's presence, there also is a dimension of modesty which implies respect for one's fellow man and restraint in revealing one's body and bodily functions in his presence.<br>", "One should not speak while relieving himself, even if there is great need. - <i>Berachot</i> 62a states that \"modesty and silence are appropriate for the latrine.\" <i>Sanhedrin</i> 19a states that women are allowed to speak in the latrine to prevent men from entering.<br>", "Just as he conducts himself with modesty while in the latrine by day, he should also do so at night. - <i>Berachot</i>, ibid. Since modesty is practiced out of an awareness of God's presence, there is no difference between day and night (The Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 52).<br>", "One should always train himself to relieve himself in the early morning and after dark only, so that he [need] not go far off - to avoid others seeing him (<i>Berachot</i>, ibid.).<br>"], "Sabbath 7.1": ["With regard to the [forbidden] labors for which one is liable to be executed by stoning - when a forbidden labor is performed in the presence of witnesses who administer a warning (Chapter 1, Halachah 1)<br>", "or to receive karet if one transgresses willingly - when a forbidden labor is performed when witnesses are not present (<i>ibid.</i>)<br>", "or for which one is obligated to bring a sin offering if one commits the transgression unknowingly, - i.e., one intended to perform the forbidden labor, but was not aware that doing so was breaking the Sabbath laws.<br>", "there are primary categories and [their] derivatives. - In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2), the Rambam explains that the primary categories are so defined because \"they were part of the work of the Sanctuary, which is termed <i>melachah</i> [the term used for the Torah for forbidden labor].\" The Rambam clarifies the definition of what constitutes a primary category and what constitutes a derivative in Halachot 2-6.<br>See <i>Yereim</i> (249) who notes that the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) derives the existence of thirty nine categories of work from the exegesis of Exodus 38:2. There is a question if this difference in sources creates a difference in law as well. See also the preface to <i>Eglei Tal,</i> which questions whether the definition of the categories of forbidden labor are taken from the activities necessary for the offering of the sacrifices in the Sanctuary, or merely the activities necessary for construction of the Sanctuary. (In this context, see Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 73a, which states that the forbidden labor of baking was not practiced in the Sanctuary although one of the offerings was the showbread which was baked each week.)<br>", "The sum of all the primary categories of [forbidden] labor are forty minus one. - The commentaries question why the Rambam (and his source, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2, use this expression, rather than merely stating \"thirty-nine.\" Some draw attention to the parallel found in the Mishnah's description of the number of lashes given a transgressor (<i>Makkot</i> 3:10). Others explain that this expression indicates that there is a fortieth activity - the spiritual service of prayer and study - which must be performed on the Sabbath day.<br>", "They include: plowing - This and the ten labors that follow are described as <i>sidura d'pat</i>, the manner in which bread is baked. They were necessary to prepare the herbs used as dyes for the curtains of the Sanctuary. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 1.)<br>", "sowing, - Significantly, plowing is mentioned before sowing in the Mishnah. <i>Shabbat</i> 73b explains that this was done to teach that if the earth is hard, and it is necessary to re-plow the land after the first plowing, one is liable for the second plowing as well. The Rambam, however, follows the usual order of activities. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.)<br>", "reaping - As explained in Chapter 8, Halachah 3, this refers to reaping with a utensil. Severing produce by hand is considered merely a derivative. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 3.)<br>", "collecting sheaves - In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions that the reapers usually gather the grain in small sheaves. Others follow who collect these sheaves into larger bundles. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 5.)<br>According to one opinion in <i>Shabbat</i> 96b, there is an explicit reference to the prohibition of this labor on the Sabbath. Numbers, ch. 15, relates that a person was executed for collecting wood on the Sabbath. As the Rambam states Chapter 21, Halachah 11, this labor includes only the collection of produce. Gathering other substances - e.g., salt - is not included. It is, however, forbidden by Rabbinic decree.<br>", "threshing - applying pressure to grain to extract the kernel from its husk. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 7.)<br>", "winnowing - casting the mixture of kernels and husks to the wind. The wind will blow away the chaff, while the kernels that are heavier will fall to the ground.<br>", "separating - separating stones and the like from the kernels of grain. This is usually done by hand.<br>", "grinding - crushing the kernels into flour. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 15.)<br>", "sifting - the flour with a sifter. <i>Shabbat</i> 74a (see also Chapter 8, Halachah 11) notes that the three labors - winnowing, separating, and sifting - are similar. Nevertheless, because they represent three different activities performed in the construction of the Sanctuary, each one is considered a separate primary category of forbidden labor.<br>", "kneading - mixing the flour with water to create a dough. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 16.)<br>", "baking - This also includes cooking, roasting, or the like. In the construction of the Sanctuary, cooking was necessary for the preparation of dyes. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 1.)<br><b>shearing -</b> This and the following twelve labors are necessary for the preparation of fabric. Shearing involves removing hair or wool from an animal, whether dead or alive. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 7.)<br><b>whitening -</b> After the wool is removed from the animal, it is washed to remove dirt. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 10.)<br><b>beating -</b> Unlike Rashi and others who interpret as combing the wool, in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah he translates the word into an Arabic term meaning \"beat it with a stick.\" This activity is necessary as a preliminary stage of the preparation of flax to be spun into linen. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 12.)<br><b>dyeing -</b> for most of the fabrics used in the curtains and roof-coverings of the Sanctuary were dyed. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 13.)<br><b>spinning -</b> intertwining the fibers to make thread. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 15.)<br><b>making heddles -</b> The Hebrew, literally means \"house of string.\" In the weaving process, it refers to the following practice: Weaving involves passing the threads of the woof over and under each of the consecutive threads of the warp. In order to facilitate this process, two frames are made, each possessing many threads with a loop (referred to as a \"heddle\") in the middle of these threads. The threads of the warp are passed through these loops, one from one frame, and the next from the other, consecutively. When this is completed, the weaver lifts the two frames alternately. As he raises one up, he passes the woof through. In this manner, he is able to thread the woof through the entire warp at one time. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2; <i>Keilim</i> 21:1.)<br><b>mounting the warp -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 17-18, where the Rambam describes how a loom is set up. First, the threads of the warp are extended to the desired length and width. They are then attached to a rod on either side, and held taut. This is the activity referred to by this term.<br><b>weaving -</b> passing the threads of the woof between the threads of the warp. (See Chapter 9, <i>loc. cit.</i>)<br><b>undoing woven fabric -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 20.<br><b>tying -</b> This refers to a permanent knot whose tying requires professional expertise. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 1.) In the construction of the Sanctuary, the <i>chilazon</i> which were used for dye were caught with nets that had to be tied (<i>Shabbat</i> 74b).<br><b>untying -</b> This also includes untying only such knots. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 7.)<br><b>sewing -</b> at least two stitches. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 9.)<br><b>tearing -</b> in order to sew. Otherwise, one is not liable. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 10.) If a hole was found in one of the curtains of the Sanctuary, it was cut open and sewn close (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 302:4).<br><b>building -</b> any structure; similarly, leveling the ground is included in this category. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 12.) The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> gives as an example, the placement of the boards of the Sanctuary in their sockets.<br><b>demolishing -</b> Here also the intent must be a constructive one: demolishing in order to rebuild. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 15.)<br><b>beating with a hammer -</b> The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> points to the fashioning of the <i>menorah</i> in the Sanctuary.<br>A craftsman finishing the fashioning of a utensil concludes his work by giving several taps with a hammer to smooth the utensil's surface. Thus, this labor also includes all activities performed to apply the finishing touch to an object - e.g., polishing and shining. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.,</i> and Chapter 10, Halachah 16.)<br><b>trapping -</b> The Mishnah mentions the following seven categories as activities necessary to write a scroll. Leather hides were used to cover the roof of the Sanctuary. (See also Chapter 10, Halachah 19.)<br><b>slaughtering -</b> Although this term is usually used to refer to ritual slaughter, the intent here is taking a life through any means. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 1.)<br><b>skinning -</b> the hide of an animal to use for leather. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 5.)<br><b>processing [hides] -</b> into leather. (See Chapter 11, <i>loc. cit.</i>) Significantly, the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) also includes salting the hides as a separate category of labor. <i>Shabbat</i> 75b, however, includes this activity in the category of processing hides and includes ruling parchment as the thirty-ninth category of labor.<br><b>removing hair -</b> For leather or parchment, smooth skin is required. (See also Chapter 11, Halachah 5, 6.)<br><b>cutting [leather] -</b> This refers to making an exact cut, so that the leather can be used for a purpose. Cutting indiscriminately is a destructive activity. Hence, one is not held liable. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 7.)<br><b>writing -</b> two letters. This activity was necessary in the Sanctuary, for a mark was made on the boards so that the same boards could be matched to each other each time they were attached together. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 9.)<br><b>erasing -</b> For if the builders of the Sanctuary erred in making a sign, they would erase it and write another in its place. In this instance as well, one is held liable only when one erases with the intent of writing two letters in this place. (See Chapter 11, <i>loc. cit.</i>)<br><b>ruling lines -</b> For proper writing is possible only on ruled lines. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 17.) In the Sanctuary, this labor was performed to prepare the hides to be cut.<br><b>kindling a flame -</b> This was necessary to cook the dyes. As the Rambam explains in Chapter 12, Halachah 1, one is liable for kindling a flame only when when desires to cook with it, use it for light, or desires ash. Otherwise, it is considered a destructive activity.<br><b>extinguishing a flame -</b> Here also, one's intent must be constructive - e.g., to use the charcoal produced. In the Sanctuary, this was necessary to produce an even flame for the fashioning of the metal utensils (See Chapter 12, Halachah 2.)<br><b>transferring from one domain to another. -</b> All the materials necessary for the construction of the Sanctuary were brought from the private domain to the public domain (<i>Shabbat</i> 96b). This forbidden labor is discussed in great length. (See Chapters 12-19.)<br>"], "Reading the Shema 3.1": ["One who recites the <i>Shema</i> should wash his hands with water - Rabbi Yochanan says: A person who wants to accept upon himself the kingship of Heaven in the most complete fashion should see to his bodily needs, wash his hands, put on <i>tefillin</i>, recite the <i>Shema</i> and pray. Rav Chiyya bar Abba equates this process with the building of the altar and the bringing of sacrifices, based on the verse in Psalms 26:6: \"I wash my hands in innocence and I encompass Your altar, O God\" (<i>Berachot</i> 14a-15a).<br>", "before reciting it. - This is the case even if one's hands are not obviously dirty, because hands tend to touch the covered parts of one's body, and thus, require the washing of hands.<br>The Rambam holds that a blessing is recited after one washes one's hands before <i>Kri'at</i> Shema. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:2.) The requirement to wash our hands upon rising in the morning was established by the Sages as a preparation for <i>Kri'at</i> Shema and the <i>Amidah</i>. A blessing was instituted for this act and, therefore, a blessing is recited every time that one washes his hands before <i>Kri'at</i> Shema or the <i>Amidah</i>. (Rabbenu Asher also shares this position. See his notes to the ninth chapter of <i>Berachot</i>.)<br>The Rashba explains, however, that the blessing \u05e2\u05dc \u05e0\u05d8\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd was instituted as one of the many blessings that one recites upon rising in the morning (\u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05d7\u05e8). In response to receiving anew his soul from Heaven, one is obligated to praise and thank God. In that context, the Sages also instituted the requirement that he sanctify himself for his day's worship, just as the priests in the Temple did - i.e., by washing his hands with water from a vessel. There is, however, no intrinsic connection between the washing of hands, and <i>Kri'at</i> Shema and the <i>Amidah</i>. Therefore, the blessing is recited only in the morning upon rising.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 92:5 and 233:2 agrees with the Rashba and does not require a blessing upon washing hands in preparation for <i>Kri'at</i> Shema and the <i>Amidah</i>. (See also <i>Beit Yosef</i> on <i>Tur Orach Chayim</i> 7, <i>Magen Avraham</i>, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> on <i>Orach Chayim</i> 4:1, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 4:1.)<br>", "If the time for reciting the <i>Shema</i> arrives - See Chapter 1, Halachah 11. According to the Rambam's position, this refers to ten minutes before sunrise. The differing opinions will interpret it to mean that the third hour of the morning will soon pass.<br>", "and he cannot find water, he should not delay his recitation in order to search for water. - In contrast, in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:2 and 4:3, the Rambam obligates one to travel a substantial distance (up to 4 kilometers) to find water in order to wash his hands before the <i>Amidah</i>. Rabbenu Manoach explains that, in the latter instance, the law is stricter because there is a longer time during which one may recite the <i>Amidah</i> - until the end of the fourth hour. Hence, we need not worry that he will miss the proper time.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that we are stricter regarding the time of <i>Kri'at</i> Shema since it is a Torah obligation. Were a person obligated to travel great distances in search of water, he might miss the proper time of <i>Kri'at</i> Shema simply in order to fulfill the Rabbinic ordinance regarding washing his hands.<br>", "Rather, he should clean his hands with earth, a stone, or a beam [of wood] - <i>Berachot</i> 15a explains that Psalms 26:6, the verse from which the obligation to wash is derived, does not state \"I wash my hands in water,\" but rather <i>binikayon</i>, in innocence or cleanliness. Thus, anything useful for cleaning the hands may be used, although water is most preferable.<br>", "or a similar object, and then recite. - <i>Berachot</i> 15a uses the expression \u201canything that cleans.\u201d Therefore, rough clothing is also useful for this purpose (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>), as is cleaning one's hands by rubbing them against the wall (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 92:6).<br>"], "Reading the Shema 3.2": ["One should not recite the <i>Shema</i> in a bathhouse - When describing the proper environment for an army camp, Deuteronomy 23:15 states: \"He shall not see any nakedness among you.\" Implied is that nakedness, and also a place where people undress even if no naked people are there, is not appropriate for \"God to walk among you.\" Hence, neither <i>Shema</i> nor the <i>Amidah</i> can be recited there. See halachot 16-19.<br>", "or latrine - even if there is no fecal material in it - <i>Berachot</i> 26a and <i>Shabbat</i> 10a explain that even without the presence of fecal matter, a latrine is not a fit place for prayer.<br>", "nor in a graveyard or next to a corpse. - <i>Berachot</i> 18a. Proverbs 17:5 states: \"The one who mocks the poor (<i>rash</i>) reproaches his Creator.\" The Talmud also explains that this term also refers to the dead and derives many halachot regarding conduct in the presence of a corpse from this verse. It is forbidden to wear <i>tefillin</i> or carry a Torah scroll in a graveyard, since one would, in a certain sense, be mocking the dead, who are unable to perform mitzvot. This is the case regarding <i>Kri'at</i> Shema also.<br>", "If he distances himself four cubits from the grave or the corpse, he is permitted to recite it. - <i>Sotah</i> 43b teaches us that a corpse \"occupies\" a space of four cubits regarding <i>Kri'at</i> Shema.<br>", "Anyone who recites in an improper place must recite the <i>Shema</i> again. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's position is based on the notion of \u05e7\u05e0\u05e1\u05d5\u05d4\u05d5 \u05e8\u05d1\u05e0\u05df i.e., that the Rabbis disallowed the <i>Kri'at</i> Shema even in a case where one was unaware of the impropriety of the place, so that people would exercise greater care in this matter.<br>The Ra'avad differs with one aspect of the Rambam's decision. He maintains that although it is certainly forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of a corpse or in a graveyard, the violation of this prohibition does not override the fact that one did recite the <i>Shema</i>. Therefore, he need not repeat it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 71:7, agrees with the Rambam. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> also.)<br>"], "Reading the Shema 3.3": ["The <i>Shema</i> may be recited facing, but not inside,a latrine that has been newly built, but not used as of yet. - The designation alone of a building for such a purpose attaches a stigma to it such that it is unfit for the <i>Shema</i> to be recited inside it.<br><i>Shabbat</i> 10a raises the question of praying in such a building and does not resolve the issue. The Ra'avad therefore disagrees with the Rambam and feels that such a doubt should be dealt with leniently - i.e., that we should allow one to pray inside such a building.<br>", "[In contrast,] the <i>Shema</i> may be recited in a new bathhouse. - Rav Adda bar Ahava states: \"One may pray in a bathhouse.\" The Talmud explains that he was referring to a new bathhouse. Rashi explains that this means that it has been designated as such but no one has ever bathed there (<i>Shabbat</i> 10a).<br>The Sages felt the stigma attached to a bathhouse was not as severe as that attached to a latrine and hence, were more lenient.<br>", "In the case of two buildings, one of which was designated for use as a latrine and, concerning the other, the owner said: \"And this...\" - a doubt remains regarding the latter: whether it also was appropriated for a similar use or not. - <i>Nedarim</i> 7a mentions this case within the context of the Talmudic concept of <i>yad</i> (\u201ca handle\u201d) of a vow or other significant utterance. This term refers to expressions that are not completely self-explanatory and leave room for doubt. Just as the handle of a cup is not the essential part of the cup, and yet when one grabs the handle the whole cup itself follows, so, too, a statement can be made which in itself is incomplete or unclear, but seems to contain within it an intimation of a complete idea. In our case, it is unclear whether the word \u05d5\u05d6\u05d4 refers also to a latrine or to another idea altogether.<br>", "Therefore, one should not deliberately recite the <i>Shema</i> there - since perhaps the expression \u05d5\u05d6\u05d4 does indeed make it appear as if he actually said the word \"latrine.\"<br>", "However, after the fact, if he recited it there, he has fulfilled his obligation. - Rav explains that this is based on the idea of \u05e1\u05e4\u05e7 \u05d3\u05e8\u05d1\u05e0\u05df \u05dc\u05e7\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 (that a doubt concerning a rabbinic ordinance is dealt with leniently).<br>", "If the owner said \"Also this,\" both have been designated for this use, and the <i>Shema</i> may not be recited in them. - <i>Nedarim</i> 7a deals explicitly with this case and understands \"Also this\" as clearly referring to a latrine.<br>", "It is permissible to recite the <i>Shema</i> in the courtyard of the bathhouse - In contrast to the previous cases in this halachah, this applies to the courtyard of a bathhouse which is being used.<br>", "i.e. the place where people stand clothed. - <i>Shabbat</i> 10a distinguishes between the middle room where some people are clothed and others naked, and the courtyard of the bathhouse, where everyone is clothed. Only there, in the courtyard, is one permitted to recite the <i>Shema</i>.In the middle room one is prohibited from reciting <i>Kriat</i> Shema even if there are no naked people there at the time (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav Orach Chayim</i> 84:1).<br>"], "Reading the Shema 3.4": ["Not only Kri'at <i>Shema</i>, but nothing pertaining to matters of sanctity - e.g., Torah study or prayers,<br>", "may be uttered in a bathhouse or latrine, even in a language other than Hebrew. - <i>Berachot</i> 24b quotes various verses which equate such utterances with very serious transgressions.<br>", "Not only speech but even thoughts pertaining to the words of Torah are forbidden in a bathhouse, latrine or other unclean places - Psalms 12:7 states: \"The words of God are pure words.\" Therefore, it is improper for them to be uttered or contemplated in a place of filth (<i>Sefer Chassidim</i> 546).<br>", "i.e., a place where feces or urine is found. - <i>Zevachim</i> 102b relates that Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon thought of a halachah while at the latrine. The Talmud then asks how he could have done such a thing, since such thought is forbidden. They explain that a state that is unavoidable (<i>anus</i> is different.<br>Rashi explains that Rabbi Elazar was so immersed in his Torah study that he thought about it even against his will. Rabbenu Manoach quotes the Ra'avad as saying that in such a case, thoughts of Torah are permitted when at the latrine. <i>Sefer Chassidim</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>.) advises that people should force themselves to think of mundane matters in order to avoid thoughts of Torah in unclean places.

The <i>Ramah (Orach Chayim</i> 3:2) mentions that it is preferable not to speak at all at the latrine.<br>", "Similarly, the terms used to express Divine attributes, - The terms used to praise God, but which are not His specific names and may therefore be erased (<i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 6:5).<br>", "such as merciful, - \u05e8\u05d7\u05d5\u05dd in Hebrew. The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and states that since this attribute is used as a name only in relation to God, it may not be uttered in the latrine. Rabbenu Yonah quotes Psalms 112:4 as a source that uses the term \u05e8\u05d7\u05d5\u05dd in relation to a righteous person, thereby refuting the Ra'avad.

One prohibits the <i>Shema</i> to be read near the excrement of dogs and pigs, and the other prohibits <i>Kri'at</i> Shema in the presence of these excrements only when skins are soaking in them. Ravvah prefers the second source, and the Rambam decides halachah in accordance with Ravvah's position.<br>Rashi explains that the idea of soaking skins applies only to the excrement of dogs and pigs, since it is a common practice to soak skins in them, but not to human feces, which is not used for such a purpose.<br>", "or in the presence of any other feces like these that have a foul odor. - This includes chicken or donkey dung (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i> based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 3:5).<br>", "This is also the case regarding human urine but not animal urine. - I.e., the <i>Shema</i> may be recited next to it. The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and quotes the Jerusalem Talmud, which includes donkey urine as one of those items that prohibit <i>Kri'at</i> Shema. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Talmud on which the Rambam based his decision most probably mentioned donkey dung (as mentioned in the previous comment) and not donkey urine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:6 reflects the position of the Ra'avad.<br>Rabbenu Asher points out that the Rambam mentions animal urine alone as not being problematic, thereby indicating that animal dung (e.g., cow or horse excrement) would be problematic. Rabbenu Asher himself sees no room to prohibit animal dung, since it is never mentioned in the Talmud as problematic. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> holds that the Rambam's position is that animal dung is prohibited only if its smell causes discomfort, and that the extent of this discomfort is somewhat subjective. Therefore, the Rambam did not mention it explicitly.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:4 rules in accordance with this understanding of the Rambam. (This is not surprising, since the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> were both written by Rav Yosef Karo.)<br>", "One need not distance oneself from the feces or urine of a child unable to eat the weight of an olive, - The weight of a \u05d6\u05d9\u05ea (an olive's size) cannot be determined by weighing an average olive today. Rather, it is dependent on the measure established by the Sages, and this is the subject of debate by the Rabbinic authorities. The <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) explains that the Rambam considers an olive as one third the size of an egg (\u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4, a more familiar Talmudic measure). In terms of modern measurements, this olive size would be between 16.6 and 24 grams, according to various Halachic opinions.<br><i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Chullin</i> 103a) differs, and defines a 18\u05ea\u05d9\u05d6\u05db (the size of an olive) as one half the size of an egg (between 25.6 and 36 grams according to the various opinions).<br>", "of grain cereal - There are five types of grain cereal - wheat, barley, oats, spelt and rye (See <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 5:1).<br>", "in the time in which an adult could eat an amount equivalent to the weight of three eggs. - This measure (\u05d0\u05db\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05e4\u05e8\u05e1 in Hebrew) is significant in halachah. Just as the Torah requires a specific quantity, the size of an olive, as regards many of the mitzvot and prohibitions concerning eating, it also specifies a limited period in which this amount of food must be consumed: 18\u05d9\u05d3\u05db \u05e1\u05e8\u05e4\u00e1\u05ea\u05dc\u05d9\u05db\u05d0 - the time it takes to eat this measure.<br>This measure is also a point of Rabbinic controversy. Here and in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 14:8, the Rambam defines 18\u05ea\u05dc\u05d9\u05db\u05d0 \u05e1\u05e8\u05e4 as three eggs. Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 44a) takes a more lenient view, defining it as four eggs.<br>This halachah is based on the principle that it is unnecessary to distance oneself from a child's feces or urine which does not have a foul odor. Thus while a child's sole source of nourishment is nursing, there is no prohibition. However, grains emit a foul odor after being digested (Rashi on <i>Succah</i> 42b).

However, if they were so dry that if thrown away - <i>Berachot</i> 25a defines this as feces which when either: a) rolled, or b) thrown, they will not crumble. At such a time, they are regarded like a shard.

Nevertheless, in practice, it is agreed that women should mention both these mitzvot, because the ultimate fulfillment of the creation of both men and women is when they marry. Therefore, a man and his wife are considered a single unit (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 187:7).<br>", "There is a doubt whether their obligation stems from the Torah, since [this is a positive mitzvah] that is not linked to a specific time - Women are not obligated to fulfill such mitzvot.

(In <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 4:13 and <i>Hilchot Chagigah</i> 2:3, however, the Rambam states that the obligation to train a child to fulfill these mitzvot lies on the father.)<br>The hypothesis that the obligation lies on the child is supported by Halachah 16, which states that a child may fulfill the obligation of grace for a person who did not eat to the point of satisfaction (and, therefore, is obligated to recite grace only by Rabbinic decree). Were the Sages to have placed the obligation to educate the child on his father and not on the child himself, the child would not be able to fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of another person.<br>Nevertheless, it is possible to explain that the Sages placed the obligation on the father.

They should not, however, mention God's name. - The mention of God's name causes the recitation of grace to be considered \"a holy matter.\" As stated in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 8:6, prayers of this nature can be recited only when a quorum of ten adult males is present (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "An androgynous - A person who possesses both male and female sexual organs<br>", "may make a zimmun among his own kind, but should not be included among a zimmun either of men or of women - since he is not a member of either sex.<br>", "A tumtum - a person who has flesh covering his genitalia, making it impossible to determine whether he is a male or a female<br>", "should not be included in a zimmun at all. - He should not be counted among men or women, because we are unsure of his sex. Furthermore, unlike androgynouses a group of <i>tumtumim</i> cannot make a <i>zimmun</i> of their own.<br>In the case of an androgynous, the doubt is how to define his halachic status properly. Hence, they are considered a separate category. In contrast, a <i>tumtum</i> is either a male or a female, and it is his physical condition that prevents us from determining his sex. Thus, a group of <i>tumtumim</i> may include both males and females, and hence they are not allowed to be counted in a <i>zimmun</i> at all (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "A child - The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 199:6 states that this applies to only one child, but not two or more.<br>", "who understands Whom is being blessed may be included in a zimmun, although he is merely seven or eight years old. - Rav Yitzchak Alfasi mentions an age of nine or ten. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 199) states that all authorities agree that a child below the age of six may not be counted in a <i>zimmun</i>.<br>", "He may be counted among either a group of three - to recite the <i>zimmun</i> together with two adult males<br>", "or a group of ten - to include the mention of God's name together with nine adults<br>", "for the purpose of zimmun. - The <i>Magen Avraham</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, explains why such a decision is granted with regard to a <i>zimmun</i> and not with regard to <i>kaddish, barchu, kedushah</i>, and the like. The latter prayers are obligations incumbent on a person each day, and may be fulfilled only with a quorum of adult men. In contrast, since each person may fulfill his obligation to recite grace without a <i>zimmun</i>, leniencies were granted in counting the people included.<br>Rabbenu Asher and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 199:10) do not accept this distinction, and rule that a child may not be counted in a <i>zimun</i> until he is thirteen years of age and has exhibited signs of physical maturity.<br>", "A gentile may not be included in a zimun - even when we are certain that he will bless God.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:1, based on <i>Berachot</i> 47b), the Rambam states that this refers to a gentile who has already made a decision to convert and has been circumcised for that reason. Nevertheless, if he has not immersed himself in the mikveh, he is not considered a Jew, and may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>.14. This ruling is not accepted by many other authorities, including Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher. Because of the difference of opinion, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:3) rules that, at the outset, an attempt should be made to follow the Rambam's decision. If, however, the third person does not desire to eat bread, he may be included in the <i>zimmun</i> as long as he partook of a<i>k'zayit</i> of other foods.15. The commentaries note that the Rambam does not quote <i>Berachot</i> 48a (the source for this halachah) exactly. The Talmud states \"dipped his food in brine with them.\" The Rambam's choice of phraseology is particularly difficult since, as the Rambam himself writes in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:5, brine is generally not eaten alone as a food.16. The commentaries have noted the apparent redundancy in the Rambam's expressions. The <i>Kol ben Levi</i> offers a possible resolution, explaining that, in the opening clause, the Rambam states that these people are not required to make a <i>zimmun</i>. In the final clause, he states that they are not allowed to do so. 17. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 47a, writes that if they have already decided to recite grace, the third person may not be included in a<i>zimmun</i> with them. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:1) accepts this ruling.18. According to the Rambam's opinion mentioned in the previous halachah, the third person must partake of bread. According to the other opinions mentioned above, if the third person partakes of other foods, the first two may include him in a <i>zimmun</i>.19. <i>Berachot</i> 47a relates that Rav Simai bar Chiyya joined Rav and Shemuel in a meal after the latter had completed eating. They ate another side dish together with him, and then recited the <i>zimmun</i>.20. Note the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 197, which states that they are obligated to recite the <i>zimmun</i>.21. He may, however, convey this privilege on another person if he desires (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 201:1).<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that if a guest is present, he should be given the privilege of reciting the<i>zimmun</i>, so that he will be able to recite a blessing for the host, as mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 7.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) also mentions that a priest who is a Torah sage should be given the privilege of reciting the <i>zimmun</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 4:2 and <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 12:18.)<br>22. Although a sufficient number of people to recite grace with a<i>zimmun</i> will remain, each individual is personally obligated to participate in the <i>zimmun</i> and may not recite grace alone.23. Enough people remain in each group to allow them both to recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i>. There is, however, no obligation to separate. If the people desire, they may recite grace in a single group (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1).24. Until there are twenty people, separation will prevent - at the very least - the people who separate from reciting grace with God's name.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1, based on<i>Berachot</i> 50a) states that, at a meal attended by many people, if there is a difficulty or inconvenience preventing an individual from participating in the <i>zimmun</i> in which God's name is mentioned, he may recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i> of three.<br>"], "Blessings 5.11": ["When three people who each came - It is possible to explain that this is referring to three individuals who each began eating with a separate group in the same large room. Afterwards, they joined together and ate at the same table.<br>Alternatively, the halachah is speaking about three groups that ate on the same table, and one remained from each group (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>), or the three individuals came from different groups, but left their original group inadvertently or because of forces beyond their control (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:25).<br>", "from a different group of three - and thus were each personally obligated to participate in a <i>zimmun</i> (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 50a)<br>", "[join together], - even when they themselves do not eat together (<i>loc. cit.</i>). According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this applies when they eat together. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:5) states that, in either instance, the following law applies.<br>", "they should not separate [without reciting grace with a zimmun]. - Ideally, they should not have separated from their first company. See the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i>; Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:6). After the fact, since they all have still not recited grace and are all obligated to participate in a <i>zimmun</i>, they should do so.<br>", "If each of them already participated in a zimmun - i.e., although they desired to continue eating, they responded to the<i>zimmun</i> and listened to the first blessing of grace (<i>Tosafot,</i> <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 200:1)<br>", "they may separate. They are not obligated - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (193:5) states, \"They cannot...\"; i.e., it is forbidden for them to participate in a <i>zimmun</i> again.<br>", "to participate in a zimmun again - Even if the latter group of three eat together, since they did not begin their meal with the intention of eating as a company, they are not obligated to recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i>.<br>", "because a zimmun was already recited including them. - This expression implies a different concept. If a fourth person joined the two remaining in the original group and a <i>zimmun</i> was recited, the obligation of a <i>zimmun</i> is no longer incumbent on the person who left the group. Therefore, a <i>zimmun</i> may not be recited in the new group of three (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 193:6).<br>If the three people in the new group eat together as a company, they may recite a <i>zimmun</i> (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:33).<br>", "When three people sit down [together] to eat bread, they may not separate - even though one of the three desires to recite grace before the others, they must recite the <i>zimmun</i> as a group (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:28).<br>", "even though each person eats from his own food. - It is the intent to sit down together at a single table that establishes them as a company, and not the fact that they share food.<br>25. This halachah describes a large feast, at which many people eat at different tables. Nevertheless, they all came together for the same purpose, and thus are considered a single group. (See the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 7:5; and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 195:2).<br>In contrast, in a restaurant, although many people eat in the same room, since they did not come with the intention of eating together, they are considered as a single group. 26. The Rambam is quoting the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:5). Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 195:1) state that the same principles apply if the feast is held in two separate rooms (or houses), as long as they are not separated by a street.27. Similarly, if a single group is large enough to prevent the words of the blessings from being heard, people should recite the <i>zimmun</i> in smaller groups (<i>Kessef Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 193:1). 28. He must also respond (<i>Berachot</i> 45b; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 194:6).29. He fulfills his obligation for <i>zimmun</i>, but not for grace.30. It is only proper that God's name be mentioned when the ten people are in the same room (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>). 31. If, however, two people from a group of three recite grace alone, a <i>zimmun</i> may not be recited (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 194:1).32. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 194:1) states that this law only applies when the individual has not answered to a <i>zimmun</i> previously. If, however, he answered to the <i>zimmun</i> of a previous group, he may not be included in this <i>zimmun</i>.33. He should respond as usual.34. <i>Zimmun</i> should precede grace. Once a person has recited grace, he can no longer fulfill his obligation for <i>zimmun</i><br>."], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.1": ["In the days of Rabban Gamliel - The commentaries question which Rabban Gamliel the Rambam refers to. <i>Seder Hadorot</i> points to Rabban Gamliel, the elder, grandson of Hillel the Elder, who lived in the first half of the first century of the Common Era. <i>Dorot Harishonim</i>, however, believes this to refer to the latter's grandson, who headed the Rabbinical court in Yavneh from 80 CE, after it was established there by Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai following the destruction of the Second Temple.<br>", "the numbers of heretics among the Jews increased - In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam describes a heretic (<i>apikoros</i>) as one who denies the notion of prophecy or the idea that knowledge could be transmitted from the Creator to human beings, one who refutes the prophecy of Moshe Rabbenu, or one who denies God's omniscience regarding the actions of human beings.<br>Some manuscript editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> use the word <i>min</i> (non-believer) instead of <i>apikoros</i>. In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:7, the Rambam describes the <i>min</i> as one who does not believe in God, whereas the heretic denies not God, but Torah.<br>Historically, this could refer to the Saducees and other Jews with assimilationist tendencies that began to multiply at this time.

The blessing of the heretics differs for it appears full of hate and destruction.<br>The composition of this blessing required great care, since the content must not imply the hatred of people per se, but a righteous indignation, born out of love for God and the pain felt when His Majesty is not honored. Shmuel HaKatan authored the famous statement: \"Refrain from joy at the fall of your enemies\" (<i>Pirkei Avot</i> 4:19). Thus, he was most worthy to author this blessing. His zealousness bore no trace whatsoever of hate, but was a true reflection of his unbounded love for God and His Torah.<br>Consequently, there are nineteen blessings in the Shemoneh Esreh. - We do, however, still call the prayer the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, based on its original eighteen blessings.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.2": ["In each Shemoneh Esreh, - i.e., in all three prayer services<br>", "every day, a person should recite these nineteen blessings in the proper order.

The King over all the Earth who sanctifies Israel and the Day of Remembrance\" (This conclusion is also used for the intermediate blessing in all the prayers of Rosh Hashanah.)<i>Zichronot</i> - \"...The One who remembers the Covenant.\u201d<i>Shofarot</i> - \"...The One who hears the <i>Teru'ah\u201d</i> - based on Leviticus 23:24.<br>See also the Rambam's Order of Prayer for the Whole Year at the end of the Book of the Love of God.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.7": ["On Yom Kippur, one recites seven blessings - See <i>Yoma</i> 87b and <i>Niddah</i> 8b.<br>", "in each of the five prayers of the day - I.e., <i>Maariv, Shacharit, Musaf, Minchah</i> and the <i>Ne'ilah</i> Prayer discussed in Chapter 1:7.<br>", "the first three and the last three blessings, - recited in every <i>Amidah</i> prayer.<br>", "and the intermediate blessing appropriate to the day. - mentioning the unique character of Yom Kippur.<br>", "One concludes the latter blessing in each of the services with: \"the King over all the Earth, who sanctifies Israel and the Day of Atonement.\" - <i>Soferim</i> 19:6 mentions the <i>chatimah</i> of this prayer as:<br>who pardons and forgives our transgressions and the transgressions of His people Israel with mercy, and atones for their wrongdoing, the King over all the Earth, who sanctifies Israel and the Fast Day of Atonement.<br>A similar text is quoted in the <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 613 and in most Yom Kippur <i>Machzorim</i> (prayer books).<br>One cannot presume that the Rambam is mentioning only the end of a longer <i>chatimah</i> in our halachah, since in his Order of Prayer for the Whole Year, the conclusion of the intermediate blessing for Yom Kippur is as it appears in this halachah. The Rambam's text appears to be based on the Siddur of Rav Sa'adiah Gaon.<br>If [Yom Kippur] falls on the Sabbath, one concludes [this blessing in] each service with: \"the King over all the Earth, who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Atonement.\" - I.e., as for the rest of the holidays, the word Sabbath is simply inserted into the <i>chatimah</i> of the blessing after \u05de\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9 (who sanctifies). This is also the case according to the more widely accepted longer version of the <i>chatimah</i> of this intermediate blessing.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.8": ["When does the above apply? On the Fast Day - i.e., Yom Kippur, the only day when the Torah requires fasting<br>", "of each and every year. However, on the Fast Day of the Jubilee Year - the final year of a 50-year cycle. Every seventh year is called the Sabbatical year. There is a cycle of seven Sabbatical years, the end of which is the fiftieth year - the Jubilee Year. See Leviticus 25:8-13 and <i>Hilchot Shemitah V'yovel</i>, Chapters 10-13.<br>", "one recites a <i>Musaf</i> Prayer of nine blessings like the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer of Rosh Hashanah. - See Halachah 6.<br>", "They are exactly the same blessings, no less and no more. - The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b) states that the Jubilee Year is equivalent to Rosh Hashanah regarding the blowing of the shofar and the blessings. Rashi explains that the shofar is blown in the same fashion as on Rosh Hashanah, albeit for a different reason, and that nine blessings are recited in the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer of Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year.<br>", "These blessings are only recited when the Jubilee Year is in effect. - The Jubilee Year is observed only when all the tribes of Israel dwell in Israel. The dispersion of even a part of the people put an end to the celebration of the Jubilee Year (<i>Erichin</i> 32b). Thus, the exile of the tribes of Reuven, Gad and half the tribe of Menasheh described in I Chronicles 5:26 caused the end of the celebration of the Jubilee Year. (See <i>Hilchot Shemitah V'Yovel</i> 10:8.)<br>In <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 12:1, the Rambam writes that with the Mashiach's coming, the celebration of the Jubilee year will be renewed.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.9": ["Before the first blessing of each and every prayer, one states: \"God, open my lips, and my mouth will utter Your praise\" [Psalms 51:17]. - See <i>Berachot</i> 4b which quotes Rabbi Yochanan as requiring this verse to be recited before every prayer.<br>Rabbenu Yonah explains that this verse must be understood in conjunction with the verse that follows it: \"You do not desire that I offer sacrifices; a burnt offering, You do not want:\" (Psalms 51:18 . After his relations with Bathsheva, King David realized that he could not attain forgiveness by offering a sacrifice, since a sacrifice is accepted only after an act done unwittingly. Therefore, he asked that God assist him in finding the proper means of expression through prayer to achieve atonement.<br>We, too, are in a similar situation for we have no Temple and our prayers were instituted in the place of our sacrifices. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 5.) Accordingly, we ask God to assist us in our desire to utter His praises, and request our needs in such a way that it will be desirable to Him.<br><i>Berachot</i> 4b raises a question regarding the recitation of this verse before <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Rabbi Yochanan himself states that one who starts the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> immediately after the blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, \u05d2\u05d0\u05dc \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc (Who redeemed Israel) is called a person of the World to Come. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 18, where the Rambam mentions this halachah.)<br>Why is the recitation of this verse not considered an interruption between the blessing and the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>? The Talmud answers that this verse is considered as an integral part of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and thus, is viewed as a \"long prayer.\"<br>", "Upon concluding the prayer, he says - <i>Berachot</i> 9b mentions that just as King David wrote this verse after eighteen chapters of praise (it appears in Psalm 19), we recite it after eighteen blessings of prayer.<br>", "\"May the utterances of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be in accordance with Your will, O God, my Rock and Redeemer\" [Psalms 19:15] - This verse is particularly apt for recitation after the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Proper intention during the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is a very difficult matter (See Chapter 4, Halachah 15). Therefore, at the end of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> we ask God to heed our words in any case:<br>\"May the utterances of my mouth...\" - meaning to say: May the words which I uttered in the midst of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> be accepted by You even if my intention was not complete and my mouth acted independently of my heart and mind. \"... and the meditations of my heart...\"; i.e., those lofty thoughts and desires which burn in my heart, but I cannot express, may they also be heard by You and received favorably.<br>", "and then steps backwards. - after completing the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, one takes three steps backwards.

They are called Chol Hamo'ed, the \"mundane\" days of the festivals - i.e., those days which are simultaneously part of the festival, but also days on which most work is allowed. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 530-548 for the laws of Chol Hamo'ed.)<br>", "one recites 19 blessings in the Evening Prayer, Morning Prayer, and <i>Minchah</i> Prayer as on other days. - One's prayers resemble those of an average weekday, and not those of a festival.

However, the Rambam's interpretation of this passage differs from that of other commentaries.<br>Both Rashi and Rabbenu Nissim interpret \"concluding with Sabbath\" to mean that the <i>chatimah</i> of the middle blessing should be \"... who sanctifies the Sabbath,\" with no mention of Rosh Chodesh or the relevant festival. In contrast, the Rambam maintains that this refers to the text of the blessing itself and not the <i>chatimah</i>.<br>[It is interesting to note that the position which states that in the <i>chatimah</i> of the blessing one need mention only Sabbath does have halachic importance. The <i>Bi'ur Halachah, Orach Chayim</i> 487, rules that a person who forgets to insert the end of the <i>chatimah</i> \"...Israel and the appointed times\" on the Sabbath of Chol HaMoed and only mentions the Sabbath fulfills his obligation \u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3 - i.e., after the fact, the mention of Sabbath alone is enough. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein discusses this issue in the fourth volume of <i>Orach Chayim</i> in <i>Iggerot Moshe, siman</i> 21:3.<br>", "He concludes [the blessing] on Rosh Chodesh with: \"who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and Roshei Chodashim;\" - following the logic mentioned in halachah 5 that the sanctity of the Sabbath is mentioned first for it is not dependent on the Jews' consecration of the months.<br>", "On the intermediate days of a festival, he concludes in the same fashion as when the holiday itself occurs on Sabbath. - i.e., \"...who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and the appointed times,\" as mentioned in Halachah 5.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.12": ["On a holiday that occurs on the first day of the week, - i.e., it occurs immediately after the the Sabbath.<br>", "at night, - The Jewish day starts after sunset. Thus, the prayer of the holiday will be recited Saturday night. Therefore,...<br>", "one inserts into the fourth blessing - i.e., the middle blessing of the seven recited on a holiday.<br>", "[the following]: - This extra <i>Havdalah</i> prayer is added between the first and second paragraphs of the middle blessing.<br>", "\"And You have made known to us Your righteous statutes and have taught us to perform the decrees of Your will. And You have given us, God, our Lord, the sanctity of the Sabbath - <i>Berachot</i> 33b. The Talmud discusses the exact placement of the <i>Havdalah</i> paragraph in the context of a three-sided disagreement on the issue in the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 33a).<br>There are slight differences between the text quoted by the Rambam and the text found in most contemporary siddurim. In his Order of Prayers for the entire year found at the conclusion of <i>Sefer Ahavah</i>, the Rambam also mentions a slightly different text. See also <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:28.<br>", "the glory of the festival - this is manifested in the prohibition of \"work\" on a holiday, as on the Sabbath, and the obligation to eat our finest foods and dress in our best clothes.<br>", "and the rejoicing of the pilgrim feast. -This refers to the special sacrifices brought on the holidays.<br>", "You have distinguished between the sanctity of the Sabbath and that of the holiday, and You have sanctified the seventh day above the six workdays. - i.e., on a holiday one is allowed to do certain types of work which are forbidden on the Sabbath. These are called \u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5\u05db\u05dc \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9, those activities necessary for cooking and preparing food. (See <i>Hilchot Shivitat Yom Tov</i> 1:1.) The punishment for transgressing the Sabbath prohibitions is also more severe than that for transgressing the prohibitions of a holiday.<br>", "And You have set apart and sanctified Your people Israel with Your holiness. You have given us, O God, our Lord, festivals for joy, holidays and appointed times for gladness, etc. - Joy and gladness are especially relevant to the holidays, as it is written: \"And you shall rejoice in your holidays...and you shall be only joyous\" (Deuteronomy 16:14-15). The Rambam discusses the halachot based on these verses in <i>Hilchot Shivitat Yom Tom</i> 6:17-18.<br>", "On the night after the Sabbath and after a holiday all year long, one recites the Havdalah prayer - This is the addition to the Evening Prayer that mentions the distinction between the Sabbath and the rest of the week. (See also the commentary on Halachah 4.)<br>", "in \"You bestow knowledge...\" - i.e., the first of the intermediate blessings in the weekday <i>Shemoneh Esreh.<br></i><br><i>14Berachot</i> 33a states that without knowledge and understanding a person cannot comprehend these distinctions in time. Accordingly, the <i>Havdalah</i> prayer is recited in the blessing recognizing God as the source of our gift of thought.<br>", "even though he [also] recites the Havdalah prayer over a cup - I.e., he is obligated to recite <i>Havdalah</i> in the fourth blessing of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> even though he must also recite the full <i>Havdalah</i> service over a cup of wine afterwards.<br><i>Berachot</i> 33a,b explains that originally <i>Havdalah</i> was established to be recited in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. When the Jewish people began to prosper, the Sages then required that it be said over a cup of wine. (Rashi explains that the original decree that it be mentioned in prayer was forgotten.) Then the fortunes of the Jewish people declined again, and the Sages reinstituted the obligation to recite <i>Havdalah</i> in prayer. They also ruled that after <i>Havdalah</i> in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, one must also recite the <i>Havdalah</i> service over a cup of wine. A parallel is drawn to Friday night when we mention <i>Kiddush</i> in prayer and then make <i>Kiddush</i> over a cup of wine afterwards.<br>The Rambam begins his discussion of <i>Havdalah</i> within the context of the halachot of the specific prayers recited on various holidays. Therefore, he first mentions the halachot of <i>Havdalah</i> recited on a holiday and only, afterwards, mentions the halachot of <i>Havdalah</i> recited in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> every Saturday night though seemingly, the latter would be given priority.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.13": ["On Chanukah and Purim, one adds \"For the miracles,...\" - Both Chanukah and Purim are commemorated with the same basic prayer, \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd. This prayer begins with a statement of thanks for the miracles and redemption relevant to these days, and then a paragraph describing the events of the holiday is recited.<br><i>Shabbat</i> 24a, which discusses the laws of Chanukah, is the source for this prayer. However, this Talmudic passage mentions only Chanukah, and not Purim. However, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi quotes a <i>Tosefta</i> from <i>Berachot</i> which equates Chanukah and Purim.<br><i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> quotes Rav Amram Gaon that \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd is not recited at night on Purim because we have not yet read <i>Megillat Esther</i>. This position is not accepted. It is, however, interesting that a difference was made, according to Rav Amram, between the \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd of Chanukah and that of Purim.<br>", "in the blessing of thanks. - I.e., in the blessing which begins: \"we acknowledge with thanks that You are God, our Lord...,\" the second of the last three blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 24a) explains that since \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd is a prayer of thanks and not supplication, it is included in the blessing of thanks in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<br>", "On the Sabbath that occurs during Chanukah, one mentions \"For the miracles,...\" in the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer, just as he does in all the other prayers. - <i>Shabbat</i> 24a asks whether <i>v\u2019al hanisim</i> is mentioned in the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer or not. Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah are of the opinion that it should not be mentioned, since <i>Musaf</i> is not usually recited on Chanukah, and, therefore, there is no need to refer to Chanukah during the <i>Musaf</i> prayer of the Sabbath. Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan hold that since <i>Musaf</i> is simply one of the prayers of the day, and \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd is recited on this day, its inclusion in <i>Musaf</i> is in place.<br>The Talmud ultimately decides in favor of the position of Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan. This is supported by the fact that on Yom Kippur which falls on the Sabbath, reference is made to the Sabbath in the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer, even though <i>Ne'ilah</i> is not normally recited on the Sabbath.<br>The Rambam does not mention this halachah with regard to Purim, since it is only in rare cases that Purim occurs on the Sabbath. Purim is generally celebrated on the fourteenth of Adar, which never occurs on the Sabbath according to our fixed calendar. However, cities which were walled at the time of Joshua's conquest of Israel celebrate Purim on the fifteenth of Adar (<i>Shushan Purim</i>). Nevertheless, there are very few such cities.<br>Jerusalem is, however, one of them, and there, Purim can fall on the Sabbath. In such a case, \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd is said on the Sabbath, even though most of the other commandments of Purim are fulfilled either on the Friday before or the Sunday afterwards. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 688:6 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> there.)<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.14": ["On Fast Days, - This includes the communal fast days (the third of Tishre, the tenth of Tevet, the thirteenth of Adar, the seventeenth of Tammuz, and the ninth of Av) and those fast days proclaimed in response to a specific time of trouble, such as a lack of rain. (See Chapter 1 of <i>Ta'anit</i>.)<br>", "even an individual who fasts [by his own volition] - i.e., even one who accepts upon himself a fast in response to a bad dream or for purposes of spiritual growth, although it is not a public fast day.<br>", "adds \"Answer us...\" - <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b refers to the prayer of fast days. Rashi explains that this is <i>aneinu</i> (Answer us...), a prayer of supplication asking God to look down upon us with favor and not hide His countenance from us because of our wrongdoing.<br>", "in \"the One who hears prayer.\" - I.e., the last of the intermediate blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b states:<br>Rav Yehudah taught his son Rav Yitzchak, who said: \"An individual who accepts a fast upon himself recites the prayer of fast days. And where does he say it? Between \u05d2\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc \u05dc\u05e8\u05d5\u05e4\u05d0 - i.e., the blessing of redemption and that of healing!\"Rav Yitzchak asked upon this position: \"Can an individual establish an extra blessing for himself?\" Rather, Rav Yitzchak is of the opinion that it should be inserted into the blessing of \"the One who hears prayer.\" Rav Sheshet is also of this opinion.<br>Although the Talmud refers specifically to one who accepted a fast upon himself, it is clear from the continuation of the discussion there that the same halachah applies to the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> recited by everyone on a public fast day also.<br>It is interesting to note that the Rambam obligates one to add \u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 in all the prayers recited on a Fast Day. This is in line with <i>Shabbat</i> 24a which states: \"On fast days...in the Evening, Morning, and <i>Minchah</i> Prayers, one adds a mention of the particular day in 'the One who hears prayer.' However, the <i>Tur</i> quotes the Geonim that one should recite \u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 only in the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer. Since one could be overcome by terrible hunger and break the fast, if one recited \u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 earlier he would have spoken falsely when he mentioned the fast day. Therefore, according to this position, this prayer should be mentioned only in the <i>Minchah</i> service at the end of the fast days.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 565:3) quotes the <i>Tur's</i> position, but distinguishes between the four public fast days that occur every year (i.e., those mentioned above in our commentary) and other public fast days. On the four main public fasts, he obligates the individual to mention \u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 in all his prayers. Since the Sages declared it a public fast, even were he to eat later on, he would not have spoken falsely in his prayer.<br>The Ramah ( <i>ibid.</i>), however, mentions that it is customary to recite \u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 in <i>Minchah</i> only. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that even one reciting <i>Minchah</i> in the early afternoon should add \u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5, because even if he eats later on, at least he fasted until midday. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 562:1.) Sephardim follow the custom of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, and Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah and therefore recite \u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 only in <i>Minchah</i>.<br>", "The leader of the congregation recites it as an independent blessing between \"the One who redeems Israel\" and \"the One who heals...,\" and concludes with \"the One who answers in times of trouble.\" Thus, he recites 20 blessings. - This is based on the passage from <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b quoted above. A clear distinction is made between the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> uttered by all the congregants and the repetition recited aloud by the \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 (leader of the congregation). The \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 does establish for himself, as representative of the community as a whole, an independent blessing relevant to the fast day. Therefore, he recites 20 blessings, as explained by the Rambam: 19 blessings as on any day, and one extra that is particular to the fast day.<br>There is no disagreement regarding the obligation of the \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 to recite \u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 in the Morning Prayer. He is praying on behalf of the entire community. Therefore, we need not worry about the possibility of the fast being broken, since it is not possible that a number from among the congregants will not fast the whole day (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 565:3). (See the <i>Bi'ur Halacha</i> who holds that at least ten people must intend to fast in order for the \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 to recite \u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5.)<br>", "On the ninth of Av, - The fast day commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temple, both destroyed on this date, approximately 500 years apart. This fast is different from the other public fasts mentioned above in that it starts at sundown and lasts until sundown, a full day later.<br>", "one adds [the following] to the blessing of \"the One who rebuilds Jerusalem\" - i.e., the eleventh intermediate blessing of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. It is appropriate that the addition regarding the ninth of Av be placed in this blessing, which speaks of rebuilding Jerusalem.<br>Despite this logic, there is some question regarding the inclusion of this prayer in this blessing. The source for this addition is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2). That passage questions whether the addition should be made in the \u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 (the first of the last three blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) or the \u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d0\u05d4 (the second of the last three blessings). It explains that as a general rule commemorative prayers are mentioned in \u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d0\u05d4, while prayers regarding the future are placed in \u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4.<br>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this passage, but adds that the custom is to recite the addition in \u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd (the blessing of Jerusalem). He explains that this decision is based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8a which states that even though normally, we add special requests in the blessing of \u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e2 \u05ea\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 (the One who hears prayer), one is able to make a request relevant to one of the blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, in that blessing itself. Therefore, our prayers and supplications regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem may rightfully be placed in the blessing of \u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1.)<br>", "\"Have mercy on us, God, our Lord, and on Your people, Israel, and Jerusalem, Your city, the mourning city,...\" - The Hebrew term is \u05e8\u05d7\u05dd \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5. This version appears in the Jerusalem Talmud. However, in both Rabbenu Asher's and Rabbenu Yitzhak Alfasi's quotes of that passage, the terms used is \u05e0\u05d7\u05dd (Console us...). This version is found in most siddurim, although the version of Yemenite Jewry is \u05e8\u05d7\u05dd, as in the Rambam.<br>There is also a question regarding when this prayer is recited. The Rambam seems to indicate that \u05e8\u05d7\u05dd (or \u05e0\u05d7\u05dd) is to be recited in every prayer on the ninth of Av. However, the Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) states that it should only be recited in <i>Minchah</i>, just like \u05e2\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 on fast days.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557) quotes the custom of saying \u05e8\u05d7\u05dd in the Evening and Morning Prayers, and \u05e0\u05d7\u05dd during <i>Minchah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) rules that \u05e0\u05d7\u05dd should be recited in all three prayers of the day. This is the custom of Sephardim, though Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah mentioned above. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 557:1.)<br>The Ramah explains that the rationale behind his decision is that the fire which destroyed the Temple broke out on the afternoon of the ninth of Av. Hence, we ask for comfort at that time specifically. Alternatively, the Ritba explains that only in the afternoon are we able to be comforted. Until then the pain of our loss is too real.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.15": ["During the rainy season, [the phrase] \"the One who causes the rain to fall\" - This is not the full text of the addition.

The Talmud continues to explain a parallel between the resurrection of the dead and the winter rains which renew life in the dry ground.<br>", "In the summer, [one adds] \"the One who causes the dew to descend\" - This represents one of the differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazic practice. Sephardic tradition, following the Rambam and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 114), obligates the utterance of \u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d8\u05dc in the summer. In contrast, the Ramah, (ibid., 114:3) explains that the custom of the Ashkenazim is not to utter 18\u05dc\u05d8\u05d4\u00e1\u05d3\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05de<i>.<br></i><br><i>The 14Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 114:3) explains the latter position based on <i>Ta'anit</i> 3a, which states that the Sages did not obligate one to mention the winds or dew for they are never lacking. Nevertheless, if one desires to mention them, he may. Ashkenazim do include \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 in the winter, because of the mention of the rains which are necessary. Sephardim and the Nusach Sephard recited by Chassidim do mention \u05d8\u05dc in the summertime.<br>", "When does one recite \"the One who causes the rain to fall\"? From the Musaf Prayer on the last holiday of Sukkot - The Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2a) states:<br>From when does one mention the strength of the rains? Rabbi Eliezer says: \"From the first holiday of Sukkot (i.e., the first <i>Yom Tov</i>, the fifteenth of Tishre). Rabbi Yehoshua says: \"From the last holiday of Sukkot (i.e., <i>Shemini Atzeret</i>).\"Rabbi Yehudah says: \"[When] one leads the congregation on the last holiday of Sukkot: the last one (i.e., the one who leads the congregation in Musaf) mentions it; the first one (the one who leads the Morning Prayer) does not mention it. On the first holiday of Pesach (the fifteenth of Nisan), the first one mentions it, the last one does not mention it.\"<br>The halachah follows Rabbi Yehudah's position. Even though the beginning of Sukkot is also the beginning of the rainy season, we do not mention rain until the end of Sukkot, since rain on Sukkot is a bad omen. <i>Sukkah</i> 28b-29a draws a comparison to a servant who brings his master wine only to have the wine spilled in his face - i.e., we build our sukkot in order to serve our Master, but He causes the rain to fall, as if to say that He does not desire our service and requests that we leave His presence.<br>", "until the Morning prayer of the first holiday - i.e., the first day, in contrast to the seventh day, which is also a holiday.<br>", "of Pesach - The Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 12b) explains that rain after this time is also an unfavorable omen.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 114:2) adds that one may not begin to mention the rain until the \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 has mentioned it. Therefore, before Musaf on Shemini Atzeret, there is a custom to remind the congregation to mention the rains in order to allow everyone to say \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d2\u05e9\u05dd in their silent prayer.<br>The Ra'avad, quoted in <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 114, explains that the \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 must announce \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d2\u05e9\u05dd (or \u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d8\u05dc in the summertime), and then the congregation may utter it in their silent prayer. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> points out, however, that a simple reminder is enough, so that everyone will remember and recite the same words. Therefore, one may recite 18\u05d1\u05d9\u05e9\u05de \u05d7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 in his silent prayer even though the \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 does not make the \"official\" announcement until his repetition of Musaf.<br>The laws regarding the omission of \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d2\u05e9\u05dd or the mention of \u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d8\u05dc in its place are mentioned in Chapter 10, Halachah 8.<br>", "[Conversely,] from the Musaf Prayer of the first holiday of Pesach, one utters \"the One who causes the dew to descend.\" - This is based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 1:2) which states that one should mention the dew during all three festivals.

Rabbenu Asher (See <i>Tur</i> and <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 117) raised the question of praying for rain in the summer in Spain or Germany when the climate of the land requires it. Similarly, since the crops in his area would be seriously damaged if rains were not to fall until late November, he lauds the practise (followed in Provence) which begins petitioning for rain in Marcheshvan. At present, the question has become more sensitive when many Jews live in the Southern hemisphere whose rainy season coincides with our summer.<br>Nevertheless, Rav Yosef Karo rules that all places outside of Eretz Yisrael should follow the practice observed in Babylonia. This position is accepted halachically. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim</i> 117:1 and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> which discusses this issue at length.)<br>One begins the petition for rain in the Evening Prayer of the sixtieth day (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.).

In the present case, the Rambam quotes Abbaye's opinion even though Ravva differs, stating that the prohibition applies only when one follows a divergent opinion without the support of a formal Rabbinical court (<i>Yevamot</i> 14a). When, however, there is a Rabbinical court which advocates each of the differing opinions - e.g., the differences of opinion between the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel - there is no prohibition against following either view until the halachah is determined by the supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>.<br>Many authorities have advanced different explanations for the Rambam's decision. The most straightforward is that of the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1384), who explains that the Rambam favored Abbaye's view because of the emphasis on unity. Furthermore, selecting it over Ravva's in this instance does not represent a break with the accepted tradition, since the difference of opinion here does not center on positions adopted by Abbaye and Ravva independently, but rather on their interpretation of Resh Lakish's statements.<br>", "[Because of the similarity in the Hebrew roots,] - The Hebrew \u05d2\u05d3\u05d3 means both \"gash\" and \"group.\"<br>", "the prohibition against gashing ourselves [can be interpreted] to mean: \"Do not separate into various different groupings.\" - It must be noted that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> does not quote this halachah as law. It would appear that while many of the subsequent Rabbis appreciate the ideal of unity this halachah espouses, they felt that compelling people to conform to a uniform standard would create more strife than would result from the existence of different views.<br>One of the practical applications of the issues under discussion is the issue of differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazic religious practices (and similarly, the variety of different approaches that exist within these two major groupings). All of the contemporary authorities agree that it is desirable for each group to adhere to its native customs without change.

It is significant that the Rambam did not list this prohibition together with the previous ones in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>.<br>", "as [Deuteronomy 14:1] states: \"Do not make a bald spot between your eyes - <i>Menachot</i> 37b explains that here the intent is not the area which is literally \"between the eyes,\" but rather the center of the head.<br>", "for a dead person.\" When either a priest or an Israelite makes a bald spot [on his head] for a dead person, he is [liable for] only a single measure of lashes. - Although, as the Rambam quotes below, Leviticus 21:5 states specifically that a priest may not create a bald spot on his head, that verse should not be understood to be a separate commandment, but rather a further elaboration of this prohibition.<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 171), the Rambam elaborates on this subject, explaining that since the mitzvah cannot be derived in its entirety from the verse in Deuteronomy, the verse in Leviticus is not considered to be a second mitzvah applying to priests alone, but rather a further definition of that same command.<br>", "A person who makes four or five bald spots for a single dead person is [liable for] a measure of lashes equivalent to the number of bald spots he made, provided he received a separate warning for each bald spot - as explained in Halachah 12. If, however, he creates a single bald spot for five individuals, he is [liable for] only a single measure of lashes. In contrast, were he to gouge himself once for each of these individuals he would receive a commensurate number of measures of lashes.<br>", "There is no difference whether one created the bald spot with his hands - pulling his hair out<br>", "or with a potion - that removes the hair chemically.<br>", "If a person dipped his fingers into a potion and positioned them in five places on his head at the same time, since he created five bald spots, he is [liable for] five measures of lashes - because it is considered as if he performed five different activities.<br>", "even though only a single warning was given - That warning can be applied to each of the bald spots he created<br>", "for they were all created at the same time.", "One is liable [for creating a bald spot] on any part of the head, [not only] \"between the eyes\" - as mentioned in the verse from Deuteronomy quoted above.<br>", "[as is inferred from Leviticus 21:5]: \"Do not make a bald spot on your heads.\" - <i>Makkot</i> 20b explains that this verse is used to define the scope of the prohibition for everyone, both priests and Israelites.<br>", "What is the measure of a bald spot? An area on one's head the size of a gris - <i>Nega'im</i> 6:1 defines a <i>gris</i> as an area which encompasses 36 hairs as they stand naturally on one's head. Contemporary authorities explain that this is approximately the size of an American dime or slightly smaller than an Israeli telephone token.<br>", "which is free of hair. - Rabbenu Asher disagrees and maintains that one is liable even if he removes two hairs. Furthermore, even the removal of a single hair is forbidden.

The obligation to bring a sacrifice is a sign of Divine mercy, intended to allow a person to gain atonement. Since his colleague is [liable for] lashes for the transgression, he is not given the opportunity to atone for his part in the sin merely through offering a sacrifice.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.1": ["In the morning, <i>Musaf</i>, and Ne'ilah services - In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 26), the Rambam writes that the mitzvah is for the priests to bless the people \"every day.\" The Sages extended the scope of the requirement and obligated the priests to bless the people in all the above services (<i>Ta'anit</i> 26b).<br>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128:44) writes:<br>It is customary in these countries to recite the priestly blessing only on holidays, when people are in festive and joyous spirits...In contrast, on other days - even on Sabbaths - [the priests] are disturbed, worrying about earning a livelihood and the delay of work.Even on holidays, the priestly blessing is recited only in the <i>Musaf</i> service, directly before the people leave the synagogue and rejoice in the holiday festivities.<br>The Ramah's decision is based on the view that the priestly blessings must be recited with feelings of joy and goodwill, and if those feelings cannot be aroused (see <i>Zohar</i> III 147a), it is proper that the blessing not be recited. Though the Ashkenazic community follows his view, in Egypt and in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> the priests have always fulfilled the mitzvah of blessing the people every day. Many Ashkenazic authorities, among them Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi and Rav Shlomo Kluger, desired to introduce this practice in the Ashkenazic community. However, they were not successful in doing so.<br>", "the priests - The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> states, in the name of the <i>Sefer HaCharedim</i>, that just as it is a mitzvah for the priests to bless the people, it is a mitzvah for the people to be blessed.

Accordingly, just as a priest is forbidden to serve in the Temple while intoxicated (Leviticus 10:9 , he is also forbidden to recite the priestly blessings in such a state (<i>Ta'anit</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>", "Even on a fast day - when there is no suspicion that the priests are drunk<br>", "the priestly blessings are not recited during the <i>Minchah</i> service. - See the following halachah for clarification.<br>", "This decree [was instituted,] lest [people fail to differentiate between] the <i>Minchah</i> service of a fast day and the <i>Minchah</i> service of an ordinary day. - <i>Ta'anit</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) records a difference of opinion on this question among the Sages. All the Sages agree that the priestly blessing is not recited during an ordinary <i>Minchah</i>. However, Rabbi Meir requires the priestly blessing to be recited on a fast day. On the other hand, Rabbi Yosse follows the view quoted by the Rambam.

These days are associated primarily with mourning. In contrast, the other fasts are days when we increase our supplication in an effort to evoke Divine mercy. For this reason, the Sages instituted the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer on these days alone (<i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 579).<br>", "since the <i>Minchah</i> service is recited close to sunset, it resembles Ne'ilah - See Chapter 3, Halachah 6, which states: \"The proper time of the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer is such that one completes it close to sunset.\"<br>", "and will not be confused with an ordinary <i>Minchah</i> service. - which is generally recited in the early afternoon, to afford people the opportunity to eat afterwards, since it is forbidden to eat a meal in the afternoon before reciting <i>Minchah</i> (<i>Tosafot, Ta'anit</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>", "Therefore, the priestly blessing is recited during it. - Similarly, in Ashkenazic communities, when the priests do not recite the priestly blessings every day, the <i>chazan</i> should recite the blessing in his repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<br>", "If a priest transgressed and ascended to the platform during the <i>Minchah</i> service of Yom Kippur, since it is known that there is no possibility of drunkenness on that day, he may recite the priestly blessing - Because of this decision, in Ashkenazic communities the <i>chazan</i> recites the priestly blessings in his repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> during these days (<i>Hagahot Ma'amoniot</i>).<br>", "and he is not required to descend because of the suspicion [that might be aroused], so that people do not say, \"He is of blemished lineage.

The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> explains that the priests recite <i>Y'varechecha</i> - the first word of the priestly blessings - directly after concluding the blessing (see Halachah 12) recited before blessing the people, without being prompted by the reader. They take the initiative, so that an interruption is not made between the recitation of the blessing before the performance of a mitzvah and its actual performance.<br>Study of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) shows that the Rambam himself had questions about this matter. In the first manuscripts, the Rambam writes that \"the leader of the congregation recites <i>Y'varechecha</i>, and the priests read after him.\" This is also the reading in the popularly published edition of that text. However, in the later manuscripts of the Commentary on the Mishnah (see Rav Kapach's edition of that text), the Rambam changes his mind and states that the priests begin reciting <i>y'varechecha</i>.<br>In his <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128), Rav Yosef Karo mentions these different views, and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (128:13) rules that the priests begin on their own initiative. The Ramah differs and states that it is Ashkenazic practice that this word is also recited in response to the <i>chazan</i>.<br>", "The leader of the congregation reads [the blessing] to them, word for word, and they respond after him [as can be inferred - See the <i>Sifre</i> on the verse below.<br>", "from Numbers 6:23: \"This is how you should bless the children of Israel:] 'Say to them...;\u2019\u201d [i.e., the priests do not bless until one] \"says to them.\" - The fact that the priests merely repeat the blessing emphasizes the concept (Chapter 14, Halachah 7) that the blessing is God's, and the priests do no more than convey that blessing to the people (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).<br>When [the priests] conclude the first verse, all the people answer \"Amen.\" - The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> states that responding \"Amen\" to the priestly blessings is an obligation from the Torah.<br>Note the difference between this law and the ruling when the <i>chazan</i> recites the priestly blessings in the absence of any priests (Chapter 15, Halachah 10). Note also the contrast to the people's response to the priestly blessings in the Temple, (Halachah 9).<br><b>The leader of the congregation reads [the priests] the second verse, word for word, and they respond after him until they complete the second verse. -</b> The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>:45) mentions the custom of the priests chanting during the recitation of the blessings. This practice is followed only on holidays. In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the priests do not chant when the priestly blessing is recited on other days.<br><b>The people respond \"Amen.\" The same applies regarding the third verse. -</b> <i>Berachot</i> 55b states that a person who has a dream which requires explanation should stand before the priests when they bless the people.

The standard text relates that the <i>chazan</i> should not begin reading the blessing to the priests until one no longer hears the Amen which the congregation recited in response to the blessing recited by the priests (Halachah 12) before blessing the people.<br>According to the texts which read \u05db\u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd, the halachah teaches us that the <i>chazan</i> should not call the priests until the Amen recited by the congregation in response to the blessing <i>Modim</i> can no longer be heard. Both opinions are accepted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and commentaries (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128:18).<br>", "The priests are not permitted to begin reciting the blessing - either the blessing recited before blessing the people, or the priestly blessing itself, depending on the above interpretations.<br>", "until the statement of the person who calls the priests - either <i>Y'varechecha</i> or <i>Kohanim</i>, according to the respective interpretations.<br>", "is no longer heard. - In order that each of the statements and blessings can be clearly heard.<br>The congregation should not respond \"Amen\" until the blessing of the priests - This refers to the blessing recited before blessing the people, and also each of the priestly blessings.<br>", "is no longer heard.

Nevertheless, he should not recite \"Amen,\" because he may become confused and begin reading the wrong blessing to the priests.<br>Note that in Chapter 15, Halachah 10, the Rambam writes that if the <i>chazan</i> is the only priest present in a community, he should not bless the people, lest he become confused and err in his prayers. However, if he is sure that he will not make a mistake, he may bless the people. In the present halachah, the Rambam does not make such an allowance.<br>Perhaps the difference is that in Chapter 15, there is the possibility that the recitation of the priestly blessing will be nullified entirely. Hence, greater leniency is shown. In this halachah, the congregation as a whole will not suffer if the <i>chazan</i> does not respond \"Amen\" to the priests' blessings. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i> 128:19) quotes the Rambam's decision, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (128:31) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (128:71) state that particularly at present, when the blessings are recited from a siddur, the <i>chazan</i> should respond Amen.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 14.6": ["The priests are not permitted to turn their faces away from the congregation until the leader of the congregation begins [the blessing] Sim shalom.

Rather, another member of the congregation should call the priests.<br>The Rambam addresses himself to this question in one of his responsa and explains that there is nothing wrong with another member of the congregation calling the priests.

There, the Levites would stand and accompany the Temple service with songs and music. No mention is made of the priests standing there. Also, in Halachah 14, the Rambam mentions that the priests would bless the people while standing on the steps of the Temple building.<br>The Radbaz (Vol. II, <i>Leshonot HaRambam</i>) offers a resolution to this difficulty, noting that priests with disqualifying physical deformities may not stand on the Temple steps (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 7:20). Thus, the majority of priests would stand on the Temple steps, and those with deformities would stand on the <i>duchan</i>.<br>The <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i> (<i>Middot</i> 2:4) states that most of the priests would stand on the Temple steps.

Rather, this refers to an instance when a person lacks a source of income and is required to sustain himself from charity (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

Accordingly, if the new scroll has already been completed and an agreement concluded, the old scroll may be sold.

There are authorities who interpret the Talmud's statement to mean that one should not hold a Torah scroll while the scroll is uncovered. See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 147:1).

This is dependent on the discussion (See commentary, Halachah 2) regarding the extent of the obligation to read <i>Shema</i> required by the Torah. Rabbi Meir understands intention to be absolutely necessary only for the first verse and this opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 60:5.<br>", "without intention - The definition of the term \"intention\" is the subject of much discussion by the Rabbis.<br>There is a dispute among the <i>Rishonim</i> regarding whether the performance of commandments requires intention, i.e., must a person have in mind that he is performing the required act in fulfillment of God's command or not? The Rambam (See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:4 and note <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:4, and the commentary of the Moznaim editions of those Halachot) maintains that it is necessary to have such an intention. This opinion is also supported by Rabbenu Yitchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher and is accepted as Halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60:4, 598:8). [The dissenting opinions are held by the Rashba and others.]<br>However, concerning the first verse of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, an extra level of concentration is required. In addition to the intent to carry out God's command, the <i>Shema</i> must be read in fear and awe, trembling and trepidation. One accepts upon oneself the kingship of Heaven and proclaims the unity of God. It is unthinkable that at such a time, one would not focus his attention on the words he is uttering, but would rather think of mundane matters. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 60:5.)<br>Each day one should imagine that he is reciting <i>Shema Yisrael</i> for the first time, and not as if he had heard it many times before (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:1,2).<br><i>Kri'at Shema</i> contains 248 words (245 of the three sections, plus the three extra words of <i>Ado-nai Elo-heichem Emet</i> repeated upon completion of the third section). This corresponds to the 248 positive commandments in the Torah and the 248 limbs of the human body (<i>Midrash Ne'elam</i>; quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:3.)

The <i>Magen Avraham</i> also supports this position (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60:5).<br>"], "Reading the Shema 2.2": ["A person may recite [the Shema] as he is - This is based on Hillel's interpretation of the verse \"...and when you walk on the way\" (Deuteronomy 6:7 .

(See Halachah 1.)<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 63:3 also accepts this decision.<br>", "He may recite the rest while walking - for, as stated above, concentrated attention is not an absolute prerequisite for reading these passages.<br>", "If one is sleeping, we should disturb him by awakening him until he reads the first verse. - <i>Berachot, op. cit.,</i> explains that one unavoidably overcome by sleep after having recited the first verse has fulfilled his obligation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the majority of the <i>Rishonim</i> hold that this is the case on the condition that he nevertheless manages to recite the rest of the <i>Shema</i>, albeit in a drowsy state.<br>Thus, our halachah mentions the necessity of alertness for the first verse within the context of the halachot of the intention required to read the <i>Shema</i>. In Halachah 12, the Rambam discusses sleepiness within the context of the need for proper enunciation of the words of the <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. That halachah supports the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> position that one fulfills one's obligation only if he also recites the rest of the <i>Shema</i>.<br>", "From that point on, if he is overcome by sleep, we are not obligated to disturb him. - A careful reading of the Rambam\u2019s words leads one to support the position of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> just mentioned. After the first verse, the Rambam mentions only that we need not disturb the person, but he does not write that we should not awaken him. This could mean that although we are not obligated to disturb him to such an extent that he is aroused to a state of full alertness, we are obligated to awaken him so that he can finish <i>Kri'at Shema</i> before going back to sleep.

In contrast, a foreman who is there to encourage his work force, must descend from the tree and recite it on the ground.

This refers even to Sages like Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai who would never interrupt their Torah study except to perform mitzvot which could not be performed by others. The acceptance of the yoke of God's kingship in the <i>Shema</i> is fundamentally necessary even for a person with such an all encompassing commitment to Torah.<br>Similarly, as stated above, <i>Berachot</i> 10b states that the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> at its proper time is preferable to the study of Torah.<br>", "with the blessings before and after it. - See the commentary at the end of the previous halachah.<br>", "One who is involved in community matters should not stop - The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:1) equates involvement in community matters to the study of Torah, in terms of granting an exemption from prayer.

A priori (\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4), one must read in such a way as to be audible to himself and enunciate the letters clearly.

There are other cases in <i>Kri'at Shema</i> where this problem arises, such as <i>veahavta et</i> (Deuteronomy 6:5 . In all these cases care must be exercised to separate the words clearly.<br>It is interesting to note that the Rambam mentions one example from each of the three sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, in order to teach us that enunciation is equally important in all the sections.<br>", "One must also pronounce distinctly the zayin of tizkeru (Numbers 15:40  - in order that he not say <i>tiscaru</i> - i.e., in order that he not declare: \"you will garner reward.\" This halachah also applies to the <i>zayin</i> in <i>uz'chartem</i> (Numbers 15:36  (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61 records more halachot regarding the proper way of reciting the <i>Shema</i>.<br>It must be emphasized that the elongation of the <i>dalet</i> and the <i>chet</i> should not distort the proper pronunciation of the word.<br>"], "Reading the Shema 2.10": ["A person may recite the Shema in any language he understands. - <i>Berachot</i> 13a records a disagreement between Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi, who holds that the <i>Shema</i> must be read as it is - i.e., in <i>lashon hakodesh</i> - and the Sages, who hold that it may be recited in any language.

In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam explains that the one who reads intermittently fulfills his obligation even if he pauses long enough to finish the whole <i>Megillah</i>.<br><i>Berachot</i> 24b applies that halachah not only to the reading of the <i>Megillah</i>, which is a Rabbinic ordinance, but also to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, which is a Torah obligation.

Such an interruption is considered significant, since even if he had wanted to finish the <i>Shema</i>, he would have been unable to do so.<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> points out that the Ramah's position would apply only in the case that one were unavoidably detained by the need to relieve himself, or that he suddenly found himself in a place unfit for the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.

The <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 64 also explains the halachah in this fashion.<br>The Rambam, however, understands that the Gemara obligates one to return to the beginning of the first section. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> explains that both Rashi and the Rambam agree that one must return to the point of the first pause in <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, holds that the first pause one makes while reading the <i>Shema</i> is not between the first two sections.

If he has no father, the obligation falls on his mother and on the local Rabbinic court (<i>Terumat Hadeshen</i> 99).<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 48a) differs and explains that the Sages placed the obligation on the minor himself. Support for this premise can be derived from the Rambam's decision in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who ate a small meal can fulfill his obligation to recite grace by listening to a child reciting those blessings (for both are obligated by virtue of Rabbinic decree). Though others object on the grounds that the child himself is not obligated in the mitzvah, the Rambam states that such a practice is acceptable.<br>", "One who is preoccupied and in an anxious state regarding a religious duty - <i>Berachot</i> 16b differentiates between a bridegroom, who is exempt because of his involvement in a mitzvah, and one whose ship is sinking in the sea. Though the latter individual is also anxious, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>, because his preoccupation is not with regard to a commandment.<br>", "is exempt from all commandments - This is based on the principle - \u05d4\u05e2\u05d5\u05e1\u05e7 \u05d1\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 \u05e4\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8 \u05de\u05df \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d4 - One who is involved in one commandment is exempt from another (<i>Sukkah</i> 25a, <i>Sotah</i> 44b).<br>", "including Kri'at Shema. - I.e., even though it contains an acceptance of the yoke of the sovereignty of Heaven, he is still exempt.<br>The phrase, Deuteronomy 6:7, \u05d5\u05d1\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05da \u05d1\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05da (and while you are sitting in your house) implies that the obligation is only incumbent on someone who is involved in his own personal affairs - \"your house.\" Thus, it excludes one who is involved in the performance of a mitzvah (<i>Berachot</i> 11a and 16a).<br>", "Therefore, a bridegroom whose bride is a virgin is exempt from Kri'at Shema until he has consummated the marriage - The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 16a, explains the derivation of the bridegroom's exemption. The phrase \u05d5\u05d1\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05da \u05d1\u05d3\u05e8\u05da - \"and as you go in your way\" implies that the obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> only applies to someone going on \"your way,\" i.e., involved in his own personal affairs and not preoccupied with the fulfillment of a mitzvah as is a bridegroom. [In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam mentions that the bridegroom is involved in the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying.]<br>Rashi explains that this concept could not be derived from the phrase \u05d1\u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05da \u05d1\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea\u05da - \"and while you are sitting in your house\" because if there were only one verse, one would have thought that only one who is actually involved in the performance of a commandment is exempted. Thus, an additional phrase is necessary to exempt a bridegroom, who though not immediately involved in the performance of the mitzvah is in an anxious state, because of the possible problems inherent in the overall situation.<br>", "because he is distracted lest he not find her a virgin. - as explained above. Rabbenu Manoach writes in the name of the Ra'avad that the bridegroom is exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> only if he is able to have relations with his wife. However, if she is menstruating or sick, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.<br>Rabbenu Manoach also discusses the different views regarding the bridegroom's obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> during the day if he does not engage in relations the first night. He concludes that he should be obligated since \"the Jews are a holy people and the bridegroom will be able to divert his thoughts from his wife and concentrate on reciting the <i>Shema</i>.\"<br>", "And if he delays until Saturday night after the wedding - This is dependent on the Talmudic custom (<i>Ketubot</i> 2a), which relates that virgins would marry on Wednesday night.<br>and does not have relations with her, he is obligated to recite the Shema from that time onward, since - he has waited this long, we can assume that...<br>", "his mind has settled and he is familiar with her even though they have not consummated the marriage. - I.e., he is no longer nervous and distracted and can be expected to recite the <i>Shema</i> with the proper intention. In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions that by this time, his all-consuming desire to consummate the marriage has passed.<br>In this instance, the actual halachah does not reflect the Rambam's position. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:3, mentions that bridegrooms were originally exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> the first three days (i.e., days and nights) after the wedding. However, today, because of the general lack of intention that everyone has regarding <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, even the bridegroom is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (70:14) adds that a bridegroom who does not recite the <i>Shema</i> appears haughty, because his actions appear to imply that he usually has a high level of intentions. The bridegroom is also obligated to recite the blessings before and after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and to pray as usual (<i>Magen Avraham; Mishnah Berurah</i>). These positions are based on <i>Tosafot</i> in <i>Berachot</i> 17b.<br>"], "Reading the Shema 4.2": ["However, one who marries a woman who is not a virgin is obligated to recite the Shema, - on his wedding night<br>", "because even though he, too, is involved in the performance of a mitzvah, - the mitzvah of procreation<br>", "it is not so distracting. - for there is no question of the woman's virginity.<br>", "The same principle applies to similar cases."], "Reading the Shema 4.3": ["One who is bereaved of a relative for whom he is obligated to mourn - <i>Leviticus</i> 21:2-3 mentions the six relatives for whom a person is obligated to mourn: a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, a sister. The Rabbis also added the obligation to mourn for one's wife or husband. See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 2:1.<br>", "is exempt from Kri'at Shema - and all the other mitzvot of the Torah (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 4:6).<br>", "until he has buried him - The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 17b, states that one who has his dead one \"lying in front of him\" is exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Talmud (<i>ibid.</i> 18a) explains that any relative waiting to be buried is considered to be \"lying in front of him.\" This is derived from Abraham's characterization of Sarah as being in front of him (Genesis 23:4 , even though her body was not physically present.<br>", "because his attention is distracted from reciting [the Shema]. - I.e., even if he is not necessarily involved in dealing with the arrangements for the burial or the burial itself, he is exempt, because his mind is distracted (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 3:1) derives this halachah from Deuteronomy 16:3: \"to remember the day you left Egypt all the days of your life.\" This implies \"days that you are involved with the living and not days in which you are involved with the dead.\" Since the obligation to remember the Exodus (an integral part of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> - see Chapter 1, Halachot 2 and 3) does not apply on those days when one is involved in dealing with the burial of one's loved ones, one is also exempted from reciting the <i>Shema</i>.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 25a explains that the exemption of a mourner cannot be derived from that of a bridegroom mentioned in Halachah 1. A bridegroom's lack of concentration stems from his involvement with a mitzvah. In contrast, the mourner's inability to concentrate is a personal matter. Rashi elaborates: Though mourning is a mitzvah, the pain associated with mourning is not.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud notes that a mourner should not voluntarily recite the <i>Shema</i>. It is a sign of disrespect to the departed for their relatives to recite the <i>Shema</i> before they have been buried.<br>", "A person who is watching the body - I.e., guarding the body from an animal or other damage. (See <i>Berachot</i> 18a.)<br>", "is also exempt, even if it is not the body of a relative - Since a person involved in one commandment is exempt from another. (See the commentary on Halachah 1.)<br>", "When there are two watchers, one should continue watching while the other withdraws and recites the Shema. [When the latter] returns, the other should depart and recite [the Shema]. - As opposed to the actual mourners, the guards are obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i> if they are able to. Their exemption is not based on their distracted condition, but on their involvement in the commandment. Therefore, if another is able to guard the body for a few moments, the guard must recite the <i>Shema</i>. However, if there is no one to relieve the guard, he is not allowed to recite the <i>Shema</i> (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> on the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 71:3).<br>The watchers must remove themselves in order not to recite the <i>Shema</i> within 6 feet of the dead person. (See Chapter 3, Halachah 2 and commentary.)<br>", "A gravedigger is also exempt from Kri'at Shema. - See <i>Berachot</i> 14b. His exemption is also based on the principle that one involved in a commandment is exempt from another. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 71:5) points out that even while he is resting for a few moments, the gravedigger is still exempt, because his resting is also part of the mitzvah, since by resting he gains strength to continue his task.<br>"], "Reading the Shema 4.4": ["A body should not be taken out for burial close to the time for reciting the Shema - Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 19a, explains that doing so will prevent many people from reciting the <i>Shema</i>.<br>", "unless the deceased was a great man. - <i>Berachot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, questions the above statement, noting that when Rav Yosef died he was taken out for burial close to the time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Talmud answers that a great man is different - i.e., for a man of Rav Yosef's stature, even <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is postponed in order to honor his greatness.<br>Neither Rav Yitzchak Alfasi or Rabbenu Asher mentions this passage, indicating that they do not feel that it is halachically relevant. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 72) mentions the Rambam's view, but adds that his father, Rabbenu Asher, did not differentiate between important and normal people.<br>The <i>Beit Yosef</i> explains that, at present, there is no person of a stature that we would not delay his burial in order to recite the <i>Shema</i> at its proper time. Therefore, the halachah is not in force. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also omits reference to it.<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> mentions that the prohibition against burying someone close to the time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> relates only to <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in the morning. However, in the early evening, one should first bury the body and then recite the <i>Shema</i>, or recite the <i>Shema</i> early enough to allow the burial to take place before nightfall so that the person will be buried as close to the day of his death as possible.<br>", "If they do begin to remove the deceased and the time for reciting the Shema arrives while they are accompanying the body, - to the burial<br>", "anyone required to [carry] the coffin - e.g., the bearers of the coffin and their replacements and those who, in turn, relieve the replacements, whether they are before the coffin - I.e., they have yet to carry it<br>", "or after it - I.e., they have already carried it. It is customary for several people to carry the coffin, in order to involve themselves in the mitzvah.<br>", "are exempt [from Kri'at Shema] - The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 17b, states:<br>The bearers of the coffin, their replacements and those who in turn will relieve the replacements, the ones before the coffin and the ones after the coffin - the ones who are before it and are required to [carry] the coffin are exempt. Those who are after it, even if they are required to [carry] the coffin, are obligated [to recite the <i>Shema</i>].\"<br>This certainly seems to differentiate between those before and after the coffin, and indicates clearly that those who have already carried the coffin are indeed obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>, unlike the halachah written by the Rambam.<br>Rashi explains that those who have already carried the coffin are obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>, even though they may be needed to carry it again, because they have already fulfilled their obligation.<br>There is, however, another version of the Mishnah. See <i>Tosafot</i> in <i>Berachot</i> 17b and most printed versions of the Mishnah (Rabbinic edition, Kahati, Mossad Harav Kook edition of the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah). It states:<br>The bearers of the coffin and their replacements and those who in turn will relieve the replacements, the ones before the coffin and the ones after the coffin - the ones who are required to [carry] the coffin - are exempt.

In our case, the deceased is not present and the mourner is sitting silent, and yet he is still not obligated because of his distracted state (see Halachah 3).<br>"], "Reading the Shema 4.6": ["After the burial, when the mourners return to receive condolences and the people follow them from the gravesite to the place where they form a line to receive condolences. - The people form a \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 - a line (or lines) around the mourners. Afterwards, they offer their condolences one by one, as they pass before the mourners (<i>Hilchot Aivel</i> 13:1,2). Others interpret the \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 as two lines facing each other. The mourners then walk between these two lines, and as they pass, the people offer their condolences.<br>The people are generally accustomed to say: May God comfort you among the other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem.<br>", "If the people are able to start and finish even one verse [of Kri'at Shema] before they arrive at the line, - directly before the mourners<br>", "they should do so.

The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that one is allowed to recite the <i>Shema</i> before comforting the mourners, because he has not yet begun performing the mitzvah of comforting them.<br>", "until they have consoled the mourners. After they have taken their leave, they should commence reciting. - Rabbenu Yonah explains that not only the burial of the dead, but also the consoling of the mourners is part of the commandment of \u05d2\u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd (acts of lovingkindness). In his commentary on <i>Mishnah Pe'ah</i> 1:1, the Rambam divides acts of lovingkindness into two categories: a) those one does with his money, such as charity,b) those one does with his body - e.g., comforting mourners and accompanying the dead to burial.<br>Rabbenu Yonah states explicitly that this is a Torah commandment. The Rambam, however, is of the opinion that burying the dead, comforting the mourners, and all acts of lovingkindness are Rabbinic commandments. In <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 14:1, he writes:<br>It is a positive commandment of Rabbinic origin to visit the sick, comfort those mourning, take out the dead, bring in the bride, accompany guests [from your house] and to involve oneself in those things necessary for burial - i.e., to carry [the coffin] on his shoulders, to walk before him, to eulogize him, to dig [the grave] and to bury him.<br>The Rambam's classification of these commandments as of Rabbinic origin creates a problem for us. How are we to understand the halachot we have just learned?<br>The Rambam has taught us that those involved in the burial of the dead and the comforting of the mourners are exempt from reciting the <i>Shema</i>, based on the principle that those involved in the performance of one commandment are exempt from another. According to Rabbenu Yonah, who understands \u05d2\u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05d7\u05e1\u05d3 (acts of lovingkindness) to be Torah commandments, this is easily comprehended. However, according to the Rambam, how can involvement in a Rabbinic commandment exempt one from the fulfillment of a Torah obligation, especially one as central as <i>Kri'at Shema</i>?<br>The answer to this question depends on the continuation of <i>Hilchot Eivel</i>, <i>ibid.</i>:<br>Even though all these commandments are of Rabbinic origin, they are included [in the command] \u05d5\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05ea \u05dc\u05e8\u05e2\u05da \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05da (Love your fellow as yourself, Leviticus 19:18 . All those things that you would want others to do for you in the realm of Torah and commandments, you should do for your colleague.<br>Thus, the Rabbinic commandments regarding acts of lovingkindness are the specific ways established by the sages to express the Torah commandment of \"Love your fellow as yourself.\" Accordingly, although these commandments are Rabbinic in origin, since their ultimate source is found in a Torah commandment, the rule that \"one performing one commandment is exempt from another\" applies to them as well.<br>", "Those standing in the inner line - i.e., they can see the faces of the mourners - are exempt from Kri'at Shema. Those at the outside, since they cannot see the mourner, are obligated to recite the Shema where they are. - This is in accordance with the <i>beraita</i> quoted in <i>Berachot</i> 19b. The Ra'avad understands, however, that the words \"inner line\" in the <i>beraita</i> refer to the inner circle - i.e., the family of the mourners. It is the Rambam's position which is most widely accepted.<br>"], "Reading the Shema 4.7": ["Anyone who has an exemption from Kri'at Shema but nevertheless desires to be strict with himself and recite, may do so. - The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 16b) records a difference of opinion whether a bridegroom may recite the <i>Shema</i> on the first night or not.<br>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel states: \"Not everyone who wants to take the name may take it,\" (i.e., not everyone may pronounce God's name whenever he pleases). The Sages differ and allow the <i>Shema's</i> recitation.<br>", "This is conditional upon the fact that his mind is not distracted. - The Sages maintain that a person has the potential to compose himself to the extent that he can recite the <i>Shema</i> with proper intention. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintains that this is not possible for most people. Indeed, a person who does so is considered tobe acting haughtily, implying that he has the power to concentrate when most people cannot.<br>", "However, if this exempted person is in a confused state, he is not permitted to recite [the Shema] until he composes himself. - If he cannot compose himself, even the Sages agree that the <i>Shema</i> should not be recited.<br>The Rambam follows the majority position of the Sages. Rabbenu Asher accepts the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. However, <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 17b) explains that at present, our level of concentration has changed and all bridegrooms should recite the <i>Shema</i>. Any bridegroom who does not recite the <i>Shema</i> would be acting haughtily by intimating that usually he has a very high level of concentration.

See Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 76:4.<br>", "and it was therefore negated. - i.e., because of the inability of the Jewish people to maintain this very high level of purity, the decree was never really accepted as law.<br>This explanation is significant. The Mishnah (<i>Eduyot</i> 1:5) teaches us that a court does not have the jurisdiction to override the ruling of another court unless it is greater in wisdom and number - i.e., unless the scholars are of a greater stature and more numerous. There was no later court with the stature of Ezra's, and, therefore, no one had the authority to abolish Ezra's ruling (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "The Jewish people accepted the custom of reading the Torah - <i>Berachot</i> 22a relates that one of Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira's students was mumbling his words.

This response, in turn, has ramifications regarding the honor of the Torah studied in such a place. Ritual impurity is, however, a wholly metaphysical reality, and that particular reality has no ability to affect the Torah.<br><b>Rather, they stand in their state of purity forever, as [Jeremiah 23:29] states: \"Are not my words like fire, declares the Lord.\" -</b> Thus, the differentiation made above has its basis, not on human logic, but on Divine decree. Deuteronomy 23:13 teaches: \"And your camp shall be holy,\" forbidding the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of physical filth. In contrast, the verse from Jeremiah quoted above clearly implies the inability of ritual impurity to exert its influence over the words of Torah (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br><b>Just as fire is incapable of becoming ritually impure, so, too, the words of Torah are never defiled. -</b> This decision alludes to a fundamental concept regarding the nature of Torah study. On one hand, we see Torah study as being associated with the student, as obvious from the law, <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 5:11, that allows a Torah scholar to forgo the honor due him. Although that honor is not being paid to him personally, but to the Torah knowledge he possesses, that Torah is considered his to the extent that he can forego the honor. Nevertheless, even while Torah is associated with the person studying it, its essential Godly nature remains intact to the extent that it cannot contract ritual impurity.<br>"], "Human Dispositions 3.1": ["A person might say, \"Since envy, desire, [the pursuit] of honor, and the like, are a wrong path and drive a person from the world, - With these statements, the Rambam obviously refers to the mishnah from <i>Avot</i> which he quoted at the conclusion of the previous chapter.

Others observed their behavior and mistook asceticism for an end rather than a means to achieve the middle path.<br>From the Rambam's statements in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, it would appear that there are two drawbacks to asceticism:a) It might lead a person to poor health, illness, and a lack of strength which would prevent him from serving God as the Rambam states in Halachah 3.b) A person might err and feel that he has fulfilled his obligation to serve God through these ascetic practices. As a result, he may never feel the need to dedicate himself to the service of God as He prescribed in the Torah.<br>There is a third disadvantage that is stressed heavily by the teachings of Kabbalah and Chassidut and may be hinted at by the Rambam's statements in the following halachot.<br>The <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, p. 42b) states that God created the world \"in order to let Himself be known.\" Similarly, <i>Tanya</i> (Chapter 33) explains that God created the world because He desired to have a dwelling place in the lower worlds. Thus, a person who tends to otherworldliness and asceticism, defeats God's purpose in creation.<br>", "Whoever follows this path is called a sinner [as implied by Numbers 6:11's] statement concerning a nazarite: \"and he [the priest] shall make an atonement for him, for his having sinned regarding [his] soul.\" - A nazarite is forbidden to become impure through any contact with a dead body for the extent of his nazarite vow. If he contracts such impurity, he is required to bring a special sin offering. See Numbers, Chapter 6, <i>Hilchot Nezirut</i>, Chapters 6-8.<br>", "Our sages declared: - <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a. [Interestingly, the author of this statement, Rabbi Eliezer HaKfar, is also the author of the statement (<i>Avot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) that \"envy, desire, and the pursuit of honor, drive a person from the world.\"]<br>", "If the nazarite who abstained only from wine requires atonement, how much more so does one who abstains from everything.", "Therefore, our Sages directed man to abstain only from those things which the Torah denies him and not to forbid himself permitted things by vows and oaths - One should not conclude that the Rambam completely disapproves of vows and oaths. At the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> (13:23), the Rambam states: \"Whoever takes a vow in order to stabilize his temperaments and correct his deeds, is zealous and praiseworthy.\"<br>In <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>, he gives examples of people who were excessively inclined to a particular quality who take vows to correct their faults (in a manner reminiscent of his advice in the beginning of Chapter 2 of these halachot). Rather, what the Rambam criticizes in our halachah is abstention for the sake of abstention.<br>", "[of abstention]. - Note the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 4:12:<br>Rav Chizkiyah the priest said in the name of Rav: \"A person will ultimately be called to judgment for everything which his eye saw and which he did not taste.\"Rav Lazar was concerned because of this teaching. He saved his pennies and would [purchase] and eat from every fruit once a year.<br>", "Thus, our Sages stated: - The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Nedarim</i> 9:1<br>", "Are not those things which the Torah has prohibited sufficient for you that you must forbid additional things to yourself? - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam prefaces this statement with the following comment: \"Our Sages have made statements about this subject which are more marvelous than any others that I have ever seen.\"<br>This general statement also refers to those who fast constantly. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam also criticizes excessive fasting. He quotes the prophet, Zechariah, who questions the motives of the Jews' fasts (7:5): \"Was it for Me that you fasted?\" and exhorts them to \"Practice true justice, and show kindness and mercy every man to his brother\" as the proper service of God. To underscore this point, he concludes with the prophecy (<i>ibid.</i> 8:19) that even the public fasts will ultimately be transformed into festivals and days of rejoicing.<br>", "They are not following a good path, [for] our Sages - <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a<br>", "have forbidden a man to mortify himself by fasting. - The phrase \"to mortify himself\" is significant here. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Ta'anit</i> 1:4; 1:9) himself mentions that the Sages commanded both the community and the individual to fast in times of distress.<br>The Rambam's statements have been questioned by the Rashba (Responsa 431 and 688) and by the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> based on <i>Nedarim</i> 10a. However, the commentaries note that Shmuel, the author of the statement in <i>Ta'anit</i>, also states (<i>Bava Kama</i> 91a) that one may fast. Here, the Rambam's statements are directed against self- mortification and asceticism and not against fasting per se.<br>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, when the Rambam describes \"the paths of Teshuvah\" (3:4), he makes no mention of fasting.<br>", "Of all the above, and their like, Solomon directed and said: \"Do not be overly righteous and do not be overly clever; why make yourself desolate?\" (Ecclesiastes 7:16  - The midrashic works have not interpreted this verse in the manner suggested here. However, we find other Spanish Jewish Sages who followed this interpretation. See Duties of the Heart 3:25, Ibn Ezra in his commentary to Ecclesiastes.<br>Note that this verse uses the two terms - the righteous (<i>tzadik</i> and the wise (<i>chacham</i>) - which the Rambam has used to designate the man with a ideal traits.<br>The placement of this halachah raises questions. One might have expected it to appear in the previous chapter which deals with other excesses and deviations from the middle path. However, it is possible to explain that, in its present position, it serves as a preface to the following halachot which explain how our service of God and connection to Him can be established within the context of our material reality. Thus, when viewed as a totality, this chapter emphasizes how Judaism desires that religious fulfillment be found within the context of our day to day life, rather than in otherworldly \"spiritual\" activities.<br>"], "Human Dispositions 3.2": ["A person should direct his heart and the totality of his behavior to one goal, - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, Chapter 5, the Rambam addresses himself to many of the concepts mentioned in this and the following halachah. He begins that chapter with the declaration:<br>A person must control all the powers of his soul with [his] intellect... and concentrate on a single goal at all times: To comprehend God, blessed be He, to the extent that man can know Him.All of his activities: what he does, the way he rests, and what he says should lead to this goal.<br>", "becoming aware of God, blessed be He. - Literally, the term means \"The Name,\" but obviously, it refers to the Master of The Name.<br>", "The [way] he rests, rises, and speaks should all be directed to this end. - In the previous Halachah, the Rambam condemned asceticism and otherworldliness. In this Halachah, he stresses the desired intent of our worldly involvement, to know God.<br>In Chapter 1, Halachah 6, the Rambam introduced a religious component into the development of an ethical personalty, pointing out that we must \"imitate\" God's qualities. In this halachah, he adds a further point. All of man's actions are to be taken in an atmosphere of God-awareness.<br>The concept of knowing God recalls the opening Halachah of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:<br>The fundamental [principle] upon which all fundamental [principles are based] and the pillar of the wisdoms is to know that there is a Primary Being.<br>In both halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the knowledge of God is not an abstract, intellectual past-time, but rather an all- encompassing commitment, embracing every aspect of our experience. Torah living does not confine God to the synagogue or the house of study, but provides us with a means to relate to Him within every dimension of our lives (<i>Al HaTeshuvah</i>).<br>For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. - i.e., he should not view the acquisition of money as an end in its own right.<br>", "Rather, he should do these things, - as a means...<br>", "so that he will be able to obtain that which the body needs - food, drink, a home and a wife. - However, as the Rambam continues in the following Halachah, the maintenance of physical well-being is also not an end in its own right. Rather, it is also only a means for the service of God.<br>Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also uses the expression \"solely for pleasure,\" indicating that the Rambam does not advocate a life without physical pleasure. (Note also the passage from the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, quoted below.)<br>There is nothing wrong with enjoying food, for example, as long as one does so within the framework of maintaining health. Indeed, in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam emphasizes how one may use pleasure to encourage himself to perform the acts necessary to maintain his health.<br>", "to the point where he will eat and drink only that which is sweet to the palate and have intercourse for pleasure. Rather, he should take care to eat and drink only in order to be healthy in body and limb. - The Rambam has just laid down the principle that all of man's actions are to be carried out in a framework of awareness of God. Yet, to exemplify this principle, he speaks not of awareness of God, but of avoiding indulgence and maintaining one's health. The Rambam introduces the maintenance of health as an immediate - and intermediary - goal which will provide us with a program of concrete action.<br>", "Therefore, he should not eat all that the palate desires like a dog or a donkey. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam states: \"In such an activity, a person is just like an animal. It is not an action man undertakes because he is a man, but rather, one that he undertakes because he is an animal.\"<br>", "Rather, he should eat what is beneficial for the body, be it bitter or sweet. Conversely, he should not eat what is harmful to the body, even though it is sweet to the palate. - The Rambam gives a full list of proper eating habits in the following chapter. Here, he cites only selected examples:<br>", "For example: a person with a warm constitution should not eat meat or honey, nor drink wine - as Solomon has stated in a parable: The eating of much honey is not good (Proverbs 25:27 . One should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter, - this is given as a remedy for a warm liver constitution (Maimonides' Medical Aphorisms).<br>", "for then, he will be eating and drinking for medical reasons only, in order to become healthy and be whole - for a man cannot exist without eating and drinking.", "Similarly, he should not have intercourse except to keep his body healthy - See Chapter 4, Halachah 19, for a discussion of this matter.<br>", "and to preserve the [human] race. - The Ra'avad mentions a third reason for intercourse - granting one's wife her conjugal rights The Rambam does not mention that issue here because, in these chapters he focuses on those behaviors in which a person engages voluntarily as an expression of his personal desires. He discusses a man's conjugal obligations later in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 14 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "Therefore, he should not engage in intercourse whenever he feels desire, - See also Chapter 5, Halachah 4, which discusses the frequency of intimate relations.<br>", "but when he knows that he requires a seminal emission for medical reasons, or in order to preserve the [human] race. - In his commentary to the mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, the Rambam writes:<br>The intent of intimate relations is the preservation of the species and not only pleasure. The aspect of pleasure was only introduced in order to arouse the creations toward that ultimate goal...The proof of this is that desire and pleasure cease after ejaculation for this was the entire goal for which our instincts were aroused. If the goal were pleasure, satisfaction would continue as long as man desired.<br>"], "Human Dispositions 3.3": ["A person who accustoms himself to live by [the rules of] medicine does not follow a proper path if his sole intention is that his entire body and limbs be healthy - The Rambam puts the maintenance of health mentioned in the previous halachah into proper perspective. It is not to be pursued as a goal in its own right. Rather, it should be appreciated as merely a means to enable one to reach an awareness of God. The Rambam develops this idea at length in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> Chapter 5. There, he states:<br>A person should have the intention while eating, drinking, having intercourse, sleeping, awakening, moving, and resting, [that he does so] for the purpose of his physical health alone.His intention in [seeking] physical health should be to prepare for the soul healthy and sound vessels to acquire wisdom and intellectual and emotional advantages until he reaches the goal of [knowing God].<br>", "and that he have children who will do his work and toil for him.- i.e., though procreation is a valid reason for intimate relations, one's intent in procreation should not be selfish.<br>", "Rather, he should have the intent that his body be whole and strong, in order for his inner soul to be upright so that [it will be able] to know God. - The Rambam also elaborates on the interrelation between the attainment of physical health and spiritual achievement in the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 27.<br>Heath is necessary as part of one's process of striving to know God...<br>", "For it is impossible to understand and become knowledgeable in the wisdoms when one is starving or sick, or when one of his limbs pains him. - The Maggid of Mezeritch would say: \"A small hole in the body creates a large hole in the soul.\"<br>", "[Similarly,] one should intend to have a son [with the hope that perhaps he will be a wise and great man in Israel. - This is the desired goal in procreation - to perpetuate the nation, not only physically, but also spiritually.<br>Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam associates such behavior with Deuteronomy 6:5: \"Love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.\" The course of action described enables us to dedicate every aspect of our being toward the love of God as prescribed by this verse.<br>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He. - Perhaps, the Rambam uses this name for God to convey the concept that just as God's presence pervades all existence, our service of Him must encompass all aspects of our lives.<br>On this matter, our Sages - <i>Avot</i> 2:15<br>", "have directed and said: \"And all your deeds should be for the sake of Heaven.\" - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam elaborates upon this statement as follows:<br>Our Sages included this entire concept in the most succinct expression possible... When one meditates on this concise statement, one wonders how they could describe in its entirety an idea so awesome that many books were written about it without encompassing it totally. Without a doubt, [the statement] was made with Divine inspiration.<br>The commentaries note that <i>Beitzah</i> 16a stated concerning Hillel: \"All of his deeds were for the sake of Heaven,\" and associates that with the following narrative in <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 34:3.<br>Hillel bid his students farewell. They asked him where he was going He told them that he was going to perform a mitzvah. They discovered that he was going to the bathhouse and asked him to explain his previous statements. He told them: Since the human body is created in the image of God, it is a mitzvah to wash oneself.<br>", "This is what Solomon declared in his wisdom: \"Know Him in all your ways - <i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i> 17:7 also associates the above statement with this Biblical quote. <i>Berachot</i> 63b describes this verse as: \"A small passage upon which all the fundamentals of Torah depend.\" Note also the Rambam's comments in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, <i>ibid.</i><br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. III, notes that the rules of Torah scholarship would have called for the quotation of the Biblical verse before the quote from our Sages. However, the Rambam chooses this sequence because it reflects a progression in the service of God.<br>\"All of your deeds should be for the Sake of Heaven\" implies that the deeds are not themselves holy, merely that they are directed toward a Godly intent. \"Know Him in all your ways\" implies that a bond with God can be established within the context of our physical activity itself.<br>", "and He will straighten your paths\" (Proverbs 3:6 . - In <i>Iggerot HaKodesh</i>, the Ramban interprets the state described in this clause as a natural product of the elevated rung of service mentioned in the previous clause. When a person develops an all encompassing bond with God, Divine light will illuminate all his paths.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.1": ["It is a positive commandment from the Torah - <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 170) and <i>Sefer Hachinuch</i> (Mitzvah 405) count this mitzvah as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>", "to hear the sounding of the shofar - The mitzvah is not the blowing of the shofar, as might be inferred from the verse, but rather listening to the blowing. The blessing recited before the fulfillment of this mitzvah, praising God for commanding us \"to listen to the sounding of the shofar (Chapter 3, Halachah 10),\" emphasizes this principle.<br>Accordingly, the Rambam writes (Chapter 1, Halachah 8) that a person who blows a shofar without hearing it does not fulfill the mitzvah. Conversely, he writes (Responsum 78) that if the mitzvah were the blowing of the shofar, a person who heard it being blown, but did not blow it himself, would not fulfill his obligation.<br>It must be noted that the published text of the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon states that the mitzvah is \"to sound the shofar.\" Also, concerning the blowing of the shofar in the <i>yovel</i>, the Rambam himself writes that: \"it is a positive mitzvah to blow the shofar on the tenth of Tishre... (<i>Hilchot Shemitah V'Yovel</i> 10:10).\"<br>", "on Rosh HaShanah, as [Numbers 29:1] states: \"It shall be a day of sounding [the ram's horn] for you.\" - Though the ram's horn is not explicitly mentioned in the verse, our Sages derived the requirement as the Rambam explains.<br>", "The shofar, which is sounded both on Rosh HaShanah and for the yovel - to announce the freeing of the slaves and the return of property, as explained in Leviticus 25:9-13.<br>", "is a bent -Rams' horns are always bent. This, too, has homiletic significance, referring to the bending over of our proud hearts. (See <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26b.)<br>", "ram's horn. - <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 16a states that a ram's horn is used to recall the <i>akedah</i> (binding) of Isaac.<br>", "All shofarot other than that of a ram are unacceptable. - The Rambam's opinion is based on the statement of Rav Levi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b), who declares: \"The mitzvah of Rosh Hashanah is to be performed with bent [shofarot],\" implying the use of a sheep's or ram's horn for that is their natural shape.<br>The Ra'avad, Rabbenu Asher, and many other Rishonim maintain that Rav Levi desired to designate the type of shofar which is most preferable to use, but did not intend to disqualify the horns of other animals. Their view is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:1), which states that it is desirable to use the horn of a ram. However, if that is not possible, the horn of any animal may be used. The only exceptions are the horns of a cow and some wild animals whose horns are single, solid entities (Ramban).<br>", "Even though the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah - The above verse merely mentions \u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 - \"a day of sounding\" - without stating what must be sounded.<br>", "is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah [it was derived by our Sages in the following manner]. Concerning the yovel, [Leviticus 25:9] states: \"You shall make a proclamation, sounding the shofar...you shall proclaim with the shofar.\" The oral tradition - <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b<br>", "explains that just as the \"sounding\" required by the Torah in the yovel requires a shofar, so, too, the \"sounding\" on Rosh HaShanah requires a shofar. - An analogy (\u05d2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e9\u05d5\u05d4) is drawn between the two verses, to teach that the same type of \"sounding\" is required on both occasions. Thus, since the Torah specifies states that the \"sounding\" of the <i>yovel</i> is carried out with a shofar, that same instrument is used on Rosh HaShanah.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.2": ["In the Temple - As will be explained in the commentary to Chapter 2, Halachah 8, and Chapter 7, Halachah 13, in certain contexts the Rambam interprets the expression \u05d1\u05de\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9 - literally, \"in the holy place\" - as referring to the entire city of Jerusalem. (See also the Rambam's commentary to the mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 4:1.) However, in the present context, it refers to the Temple alone. Thus, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 27a states that the shofar was sounded in this manner only \"on the Temple Mount and at the eastern gate.\"<br>", "on Rosh HaShanah, they would blow [the shofar in the following manner]: There was one shofar and two trumpets, [one on either] side. - The verse from Psalms mentions \"the voice of the shofar,\" using the singular. In contrast, it refers to \"trumpets.\"<br>", "The sounding of the shofar was extended - for greater emphasis<br>", "while that of the trumpets was shortened, because the mitzvah of the day is performed with the shofar. - <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26b contrasts the sounding of the shofar and trumpets on Rosh HaShanah with their being blown on a fast day declared because of unfavorable conditions. On the latter occasion, the sounding of the trumpets was emphasized in keeping with the instructions of Numbers 10:9.<br>", "Why were the trumpets sounded together with it? Because [Psalms 98:6] states: \"You shall sound trumpets and the voice of the shofar before God, the King.\" - <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a states that the expression \"before God\" implies: in the Temple.<br>", "However, in other places - even within Jerusalem<br>", "on Rosh Hashanah, only the shofar is blown.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3": ["At the outset, we should not blow a shofar of idol worship. - For it is not appropriate to use such a shofar for a mitzvah.<br>", "However, if one sounded it, one has fulfilled his obligation. - The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this refers to a shofar belonging to a gentile that was used in the worship of idols, or a shofar which was itself worshiped as an idol. However, as will be explained, if the shofar of idol worship belonged to a Jew or if it was made from the horn of an animal that was sacrificed to an idol, even after the fact, its use is not acceptable.<br>", "[In contrast,] should one sound a shofar belonging to an apostate city, - \u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d3\u05d7\u05ea. Deuteronomy 13:13-19 describes the laws governing a city in which the majority of the inhabitants have turned to idol worship. All the idolaters must be slain and all the homes and property burned. No benefit may be derived from them. (See also <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>, Chapter 4.)<br>", "one has not fulfilled one's obligation. - <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a explains that the difference between a shofar of idol worship and one of an apostate city is that all the property within the latter must be destroyed. Since ultimately this shofar must be burnt, even before it is actually destroyed it is no longer considered to be an existent entity. Thus, we may not use it on Rosh HaShanah, because a shofar used for the mitzvah must be of a specific size - slightly larger than one's hand, as mentioned in Halachah 5 - and a nonexistent entity has no size at all.<br>A shofar of idol worship must also be destroyed. However, should the gentile negate its connection to idol worship before it is acquired by a Jew, it need not be destroyed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8. Since there is a possibility that it will not have to be destroyed, it is considered to be an existent entity and may be used for the mitzvah.<br>This principle applies only to aspects of idol worship belonging to a gentile. It is impossible to negate the connection between an idol worshiped by a Jew and its forbidden nature. (See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:9.) Hence, a Jew's shofar of idol worship may not be used. Similarly, if a Jew has acquired a shofar of idol worship that belonged to a gentile before the latter negated its connection to idol worship, the Jew is no longer capable of negating this connection. Therefore, such a shofar may not be used on Rosh HaShanah.<br>Also, once an animal has been sacrificed to an idol, there is no possibility of negating its connection to idol worship. Hence, its horn may not be used as a shofar.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:3-4) quotes all the above laws as halachah. The Ramah relates that certain authorities recommend not using even a gentile's shofar of idol worship unless we know that he negated its connection with idol worship before Rosh HaShanah begins.<br>", "Concerning a stolen shofar - one who blows it fulfills his obligation - Though in general, a mitzvah performed with a stolen article is not acceptable (see Chapter 8, Halachah 1; <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:7), this case is an exception...<br>", "because the mitzvah is only to listen to the sound - Hence, a person who listens to the shofar being blown fulfills his obligation<br>", "even though the listener does not touch [the shofar] - Based on this statement, the commentaries propose that, according to the Rambam, a person who blows a shofar without putting his lips to it fulfills his obligation. The Ramban (see <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> 1:6) does not accept this view.<br>", "or lift it up. - Accordingly, after the fact, by hearing such a shofar, one has fulfilled one's obligation, because<br>", "The laws of theft do not apply to sound alone - for sound is not a physical entity that can be possessed. Rabbenu Manoach and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cite other examples from <i>Nedarim</i> 13b-15a, where the Sages differentiate between sound and material entities.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1) derives this law as follows:Everyone agrees that a stolen lulav is unacceptable. What is the difference between a shofar and a lulav?<br>Rabbi Yosse responded: \"Concerning a lulav, [Leviticus 23:40] states: 'You shall take for yourself,' implying that only 'your own' is acceptable. In contrast, [Numbers 29:1] states: 'It shall be a day of blowing for you,' implying that regardless [of the nature of the shofar used, the blowing shall be 'for you']\".<br>Rabbi Eliezer explained: \"There, [concerning the lulav,] one must perform the mitzvah with the lulav itself. Here, [concerning the shofar,] one performs the mitzvah with its sound.\"Nevertheless, because a sin is associated with this mitzvah, Ashkenazic custom is that no blessing should be recited before blowing such a shofar (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 586:4).<br>", "Similarly, a shofar from an - animal consecrated as an...<br>", "olah offering should not be sounded, - Once an animal is consecrated as an <i>olah</i> offering, no part of its body may be used any other purpose. Therefore, we should not use such a shofar from such an animal for any purpose whatsoever.<br>This halachah applies before the blood from the sacrifice has been offered on the altar. Afterwards, the skin and horns of the animal become the property of the priests and may be used for mundane purposes (Rashi, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a).<br>", "but if one sounds it, he fulfills his obligation, because the laws of \u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4", "- The prohibitions forbidding use of consecrated articles for mundane purposes...<br>", "do not apply concerning sound alone. - In <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> 5:16, the Rambam writes:Concerning the sound, sight, and smell of consecrated objects: We should not derive benefit from them. However, all the implications of the prohibition against using them for mundane purposes do not apply.", "If you ask: \"Behold, he has derived benefit from hearing [the shofar's] sound?\" - Though the laws of \u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 do not apply to sound, there is still a Rabbinic prohibition against benefiting from the sound of consecrated articles. Therefore, one might think that we would be unable to fulfill the mitzvah with such a shofar (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). Accordingly, the Rambam explains:<br>", "Mitzvot were not given for our benefit - Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.) states: \"the mitzvot were not given to the Jewish people for their enjoyment, but rather as a yoke.\"<br>This concept has relevance in the ethical, as well as the halachic sphere. In the tenth chapter of <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, the Rambam writes:One who serves [God] out of love occupies himself with the Torah and the mitzvot...for no ulterior motive, not because of fear that evil will occur, nor in order to acquire benefit...<br>The great Sages would command the more understanding and brilliant among their students in private: \"Do not be like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a gift. Rather, since he is the Master, it is fitting to serve Him\"; i.e., serve [Him] out of love.The above is not intended to imply that a person should not feel happy and fulfilled in the service of God. Quite the contrary; indeed, the Rambam concludes these halachot (Chapter 8, Halachah 15) with a description of the importance of happiness in the service of God. However, the intent is that the happiness should be a byproduct and not the goal of the service.

Rather, he should hear the <i>teki'ot</i> from a colleague.<br>Also, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) notes that if a person specifically states that he vows not to listen to a colleague's <i>teki'ot</i>, he may not hear that person blow the shofar on Rosh HaShanah, because a vow (<i>neder</i>) can also negate a mitzvah.

This applies - not only when obtaining the shofar requires the violation of a <i>melachah</i> (forbidden labor) prohibited by the Torah, but<br>", "even when the forbidden practice is in the category of sh'vut. - In <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:1, the Rambam defines <i>sh'vut</i> as a prohibition instituted by the Sages because a particular activity resembles one forbidden as a <i>melachah</i> by Torah law, or because performing it may cause one to perform a <i>melachah</i>.<br>Though these prohibitions are of Rabbinic origin, the Sages reinforced the power of their decrees and equated them with Torah law. Hence, just as one may not violate a <i>melachah</i> forbidden by the Torah to obtain a shofar, so, too, it is forbidden to violate a <i>sh'vut</i> forbidden by Rabbinic law (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). [Nevertheless, note the clarification of this principle in Chapter 2, Halachah 6.]<br>", "How is the above exemplified? If there is a shofar in a treetop or across a river - and that is the only shofar available - one may not climb the tree - lest one accidentally cut off a branch (ibid., 6)<br>", "or swim across the water to bring it - lest one prepare a swimming aid (ibid., 23:5). The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b) mentions other examples of forbidden activities.<br>", "Needless to say, we may not cut the shofar [from the animal's head] - In his commentary on the mishnah, the Rambam explains that this refers to cutting the horn off with a household knife. Since a craftsman's knife is not being used, cutting the shofar off is not forbidden by Torah law. Nevertheless, the Rambam uses the expression \"needless to say,\" because such an activity bears a closer resemblance to one forbidden by Torah law than those mentioned previously.<br>", "or perform a forbidden labor - cutting off the horn with a craftsman's knife<br>", "[to prepare a shofar so that we may blow it].<br>", "[The rationale for the above is:] Blowing the shofar fulfills a positive commandment - as stated in Halachah 1.<br>", "while [the observance of] the festivals fulfills both a positive and a negative commandment. - In <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 1:2, the Rambam writes:Whoever rests from a <i>melachah</i> categorized as \"work\" on one of [these days] fulfills a positive commandment, because the Torah describes them as \"days of rest\"... if one performs a <i>melachah</i> that is not intended to prepare food,... one negates the performance of a positive commandment and transgresses a negative commandment, as [Leviticus 23:8] states: \"You shall not perform any servile work.\"", "The observance of a positive commandment does not negate the observance of both a positive and negative commandment. - Though the performance of a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment (<i>Yevamot</i> 3b), that applies only when the negative commandment is not reinforced by a positive commandment, as in the case at hand.<br>", "It is permitted to rinse a shofar with water, wine, or vinegar in order to improve its tone. - It is forbidden to prepare a utensil for use on a festival.

Thus, the difference between the width of a thumb and the other fingers accounts for the \"expansion.\" In modern measure, a handbreadth is considered between 8 (<i>Shiurei Torah</i>) and 9.6 (<i>Chazon Ish</i>) centimeters.<br>", "Should a shofar be cracked lengthwise - i.e., from its mouth to its end;<br>", "it is unacceptable. - This is a quote from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27b. The Rabbis have noted that, in contrast to a crack along the shofar's width, in this context no minimum figure is mentioned with regard to the portion of the shofar remaining uncracked. Two contrasting interpretations are offered to explain the difference.<br>Some maintain that as long as the entire length (or the majority of the length) of the shofar is not cracked, the shofar is not disqualified. Others maintain that even the slightest crack along the length of the shofar disqualifies it, because the pressure of the blowing will cause the crack to grow until, ultimately, the entire shofar will be cracked (Rabbenu Asher; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 586:8).<br>Concerning <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, both the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (586:8) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (586:43) write that when no other shofar is available, one may rely on the first opinion. Nevertheless, even the latter opinion does not disqualify a shofar that is cracked lengthwise if it is tied firmly so that the crack will not expand, or if the shofar is heated and the crack closed. Some opinions also allow such a shofar to be used if the crack is plugged closed with other substances.<br>", "Should it be cracked along its width - with the crack extending along the majority of the shofar's circumference (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> ibid., 9),<br>", "if a measure equivalent to the minimum size of a shofar remains - Most authorities require a handbreadth to remain from the crack to the shofar's mouth (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). However, the <i>Ba'al Ha'itur</i> maintains that a shofar is acceptable even if the minimum measure remains only from the crack to the end of the shofar.<br>", "it is kosher. - This applies even if the sound of the shofar is changed because of the crack (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.).<br>", "It is considered as if it were cut off at the place of the crack. - Hence, the crack does not disqualify it.<br>", "[Regarding a shofar with] a hole: If it was plugged - In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 3:5), the Rambam writes that the hole must be plugged. This point is not accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 7), which emphasizes that if the hole is not plugged, the shofar is kosher even though its sound has changed. Nevertheless, the Ramah states that if another shofar is available, a shofar with a hole should not be used.<br>", "with another substance, - i.e., any substance other than a ram's horn;<br>", "it is unacceptable - because the sound produced does not come from the shofar alone, but rather from the shofar and the other substance.<br>", "If;<br>", "a) it was plugged with its own kind,<br>", "it is kosher [under the following conditions]:<br>", "b) the majority of the shofar remained whole;<br>", "c) the plugging of the holes did not alter its sound. - These three conditions are dependent on the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27b. Rabbenu Asher interprets the passage differently. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) favors the Rambam's interpretation, but states that under difficult circumstances, when no other shofar is available, one may rely on Rabbenu Asher's interpretation.<br><b>If one [merely] perforated the insides of the horn, -</b> the bonelike tissue inside the horn<br><b>[but did not remove them,] it is kosher, because a substance of the same kind is not considered an intervening entity. -</b> The presence of a foreign substance inside the shofar would cause it to be disqualified, as stated in the following halachah. However, since this tissue is considered to be part of the horn itself, the shofar is acceptable.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 586:15) quotes this law, but also adds that if one removed this tissue from the horn and then hollowed it out, the tissue would be unacceptable for use as a shofar.<br><b>Should one stick together fragments of shofarot until one has constructed a shofar, it is unacceptable. -</b> <i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a explains that this construction is not called a shofar. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 10) states that this law applies even if the fragment of the shofar closest to one's mouth is of sufficient size to be considered a kosher shofar itself.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.6": ["If one made any addition to a shofar - whether from the mouthpiece or from the wider end (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 586:11).<br>", "whether of its kind - using a fragment of a ram's horn<br>", "or from another substance - it is unacceptable. - On the surface, this law appears to be an extension of the principle mentioned in the last clause of the previous halachah. If so, one might question why the Rambam mentions them in two separate halachot.<br>", "Should one coat it with gold - or any other foreign substance<br>", "from the inside or at the mouthpiece, it is unacceptable - for the sound must come from the shofar itself. Though <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b mentions that the mouth of the shofar used in the Temple was coated with gold, the place where the person blowing would put his mouth was not covered.<br>", "Should one coat it - with gold or any other substance<br>", "on the outside: If its sound is changed from what it was originally, it is not acceptable - for then, the sound we hear is a product of both the shofar and the coating, and not the shofar alone.<br>Based on this law, the Ramban advises against making designs in the shofar and coating them with paint or metal, for this may alter the shofar's sound and prevent the <i>teki'ot</i> from being acceptable.<br>", "If its sound did not change, it is kosher - All these laws are quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:16).<br>", "Should one place one shofar within another: If one hears the sound of the inner shofar, - i.e., with the further end of the inner shofar protruding beyond that of the outer shofar<br>", "one has fulfilled one's obligation - for the outer shofar had no effect on the sound we hear. The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 586:20) emphasizes that one may fulfill one's obligation under such circumstances only if the sound of the inner shofar remains totally unchanged. The <i>teki'ot</i> are unacceptable if its sound is altered.<br>", "If one hears the outer shofar - i.e., its edge protrudes beyond that of the inner shofar<br>", "one has not fulfilled one's obligation - for then, one is hearing the sound of two <i>shofarot</i>.

That expression is also related to the word \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8, meaning \"to pass.\" The manner in which we use the shofar must parallel the manner in which the ram passes by with it on its head.<br>Based on the same principle, our Sages (ibid.) explain that a shofar is unacceptable if it was heated to the point that the horn became soft, and then turned inside out.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.7": ["If a shofar was long and one shortened it - It makes no difference whether the portion is cut away from the shofar's mouthpiece or from its wider portion (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 586:63).<br>", "it is kosher. - <i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 27b explains that the necessity of mentioning this law arises from the last clause of the previous halachah. Since we find that the Torah requires us to use the shofar in the same manner as which it was carried by the ram, a special teaching is necessary to inform us that a shofar is acceptable even if it was shortened.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that such a shofar is acceptable even it was shortened because of a disqualifying factor which it possessed on the portion which was cut off.<br>", "If one scraped away the horn - either from the inside - widening the hollow of the shofar<br>", "or from the outside - scraping away its outer shell<br>", "even if one did so to the extent that all that remained was the thin external shell, - even if the sound of the shofar changes (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 586:13; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 586:65).<br>", "it is kosher - since no change is made in its fundamental shape.<br>", "Regardless of whether [the shofar's] sound is heavy, thin, or raspy, - Rabbenu Manoach and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> translate \u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05e8 as \"dry,\" explaining that blowing a shofar causes it to dry out and produce a raspy tone. Hence, it was customary to rinse it with water or wine, as mentioned in Halachah 4.<br>", "it is kosher, because all the sounds produced by the shofar are kosher. - In his commentary on this clause, Rabbenu Manoach injects a spiritual concept emphasizing how the musical quality of the shofar's tones are not significant, but rather the stirring and rousing nature of the shofar's call which motivates the people to Teshuvah.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.8": ["When a person sounds a shofar within a pit or within a cave - Rav Hai Gaon writes that these laws were not merely questions of abstract theory.

If the people hear echoes together with the shofar's sound, they do not fulfill their obligation.<br>At present, there is a more common application of this principle. A person who hears the shofar through a microphone does not fulfill the mitzvah. In addition to the difficulties involved with the use of the microphone on a festival, there is a more essential problem. The listeners are not hearing the sound of the shofar, but rather a second sound, produced by a different mechanism. The microphone converts the sound waves of the shofar to electronic signals; these are then amplified and converted to a different set of sound waves.

The other authorities maintain that as long as the vessel from which the water is poured contains a <i>revi'it</i>, two people may have their hands washed from it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:13) accepts the latter view.<br>Significantly, the Rambam mentions washing the hands only once before partaking of food. In <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 11:3, where he mentions the washing of the hands within the context of ritual purity, he mentions the need to wash hands twice: once to purify the hands, and once to wash off the water used to purify them. (See Halachah 10 and commentary.) In these halachot, he makes no mention of a second washing, seeming to imply that it is unnecessary to do so. (Rav Kapach adds that it is customary in certain Yemenite groups to wash only once before meals, and bases this practice on the Rambam's decision.)<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 162:2) mention washing the hands two or three times before partaking of a meal.

I.e., whether before a meal or in preparation for prayer.6. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this expression indicates that it is not necessary to wash one's hands a second time (see the commentary on the previous halachah) or to dry them before partaking of the food. When washing one's hands for food, this is required because the water used for the first washing that remains on the hands becomes ritually impure. In contrast, the water that remains on one's hands after immersion in a <i>mikveh</i> is pure. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:19.)7. A <i>mikveh</i> must have at least 40 <i>se'ah</i> of water that has flowed into it by natural means. In contemporary measurements, 331 liters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 648 liters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that this applies only to water that does not emanate from a natural spring. When a person immerses his hands in such a spring, all that is necessary is that there be sufficient water to cover his hands. (See also <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 9:8.)<br>Significantly, Rabbenu Yonah maintains that it is acceptable to immerse one's hands in a <i>mikveh</i> containing even less than 40 <i>se'ah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:14) accepts this view, although the Ramah favors the Rambam's position.<br>8. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, and maintains that one may immerse one's hands in water poured into a pool in the ground. He supports his position by referring to the immersion of a <i>ba'al keri</i> (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4-5), which is acceptable even in such pool. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Mikveot</i> 8:1.) Nevertheless, most authorities accept the Rambam's decision. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 159:23; <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 159.) 9. See Halachot 7-9.10. See Halachot 4 and 10.11. See Halachot 11-12. The Rashba quotes the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> as explaining that it is necessary to wash with a vessel, because the washing of hands is derived from the sanctification of the priest's hands in the Temple.12. See Halachot 13-14.13. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) states that this concept is derived from the laws of the <i>ki'or</i> (the basin in the Temple from which the priests washed their hands). If its water changed color, it could no longer be used.14. E.g., ink or another coloring fell into it.15. It became rusty from a metal container. Note, however, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:22, which state that water that has become murky from mud or dirt is acceptable, because even this is often the color of natural stream water.<br>If after water was disqualified because of an abnormal color, its color reverts to the norm, it can be used to wash one's hands (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:5).<br>16. See <i>Hilchot Rotzeach USh'mirat HaNefesh</i> 11:6-16, which discusseshe prohibition of water left uncovered. This prohibition was enacted out of fear of the possibility that a poisonous snake or the like released venom into the water.17. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 30b states that washing with such water could be dangerous lest the venom seep into cuts or sores or even through the body's pores. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) notes that since the presence of poisonous snakes and the like is no longer widespread, the prohibition against drinking - and hence, washing with - such water need not be observed at present. This ruling is accepted by the later authorities.18. The Rambam is implying that the water in a <i>mikveh</i> or in a natural stream remains acceptable for washing although it was used for other tasks (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).19. If, however, the bread fell into the water accidentally, the water is not disqualified (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:8).20. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:2) states that even if the baker washed his hands in the water, the water does not become unacceptable. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (160:3) refutes this ruling. His opinion is accepted by the later authorities. 21. Slightly murky water is acceptable, as mentioned above. The determining factor is whether or not a dog will drink from the water.22. Since a <i>mikveh</i> containing such water is acceptable for the immersion of one's entire body, it is surely acceptable for the immersion of hands, which is only a Rabbinic commandment.23. These hot springs have a high mineral content and are very bitter.24. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this as referring to a stream that was diverted into a trench that does not contain forty <i>se'ah</i>. Although logically, this would be acceptable for the immersion of hands, the Sages forbade using such water, lest one also immerse one's hands in a container of water. Significantly, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:7), Rav Yosef Karo adds a further point, that the water was cut off from its source.25. I.e., the washing before partaking of bread.26. I.e., the washing after the meal (see Halachah 17); alternatively, the second pouring of water over one's hands, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4. Note the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. 27. In both instances, one must pour at least a <i>revi'it</i> of water over one's hands in a single pouring. In the first instance, while the water is being poured one gradually moves one's hands under the water, while in the second instance, one pours hurriedly, but forcefully, over the entire hand at once.28. I.e., several people stand with their hands outstretched, and a person passes in front of them pouring water over their hands.29. Although the water first passes over the hands of one person, it is still acceptable for the person whose hands are held below, because as long as it contains the required quantity and comes in one continuous stream, it does not become impure.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:16 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:68,72 state that the two people must originally have the intention to wash their hands as one, and must hold their hands close together. Otherwise, it is considered as if the second person washed with the water that was rendered impure by the first person's washing.<br>30. Note the difference of opinion on this issue between the Rambam and the other Halachic authorities mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4.<br>"], "Blessings 6.11": ["One may not use the following to wash one's hands - because they are not vessels and were not made with the intent of containing water (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>):<br>", "the sides of vessels - Broken shards of an earthenware container that are still capable of holding water. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159) states that if a broken vessel can still hold a <i>revi'it</i> when it stands unsupported, it is not disqualified for use. The later authorities (see <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 159:6; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 159:12) favor the Rambam's ruling.<br>", "the base of a samovar - Our translation is based on Rav Kapach's interpretation of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Yadayim</i> 1:2 which is the source for this halachah).<br>", "pieces of earthenware - Although some commentaries state that this also refers to shards, others, to avoid redundancy, state that it is referring to unshaped pieces of earthenware.<br>", "or the covering of a jug. - These usually contain a handle on their top, and thus cannot stand erect when turned upside down.<br>", "Should one modify such a covering - by breaking the handle so that it could stand erect<br>", "to use for washing, it is acceptable. - Although the covering was not originally made to contain liquid, since it was modified with that intention and, in its present state, it can contain a <i>revi'it</i> without being supported, it is acceptable.<br>", "Similarly, a wine-pouch that was modified - by having a stand erected for it (<i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i>)<br>", "may be used for the washing of hands. - The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159) questions why any modification is necessary for a wine-pouch, since it is also originally made with the intention of containing liquids. It explains that generally, if left uncovered, without a stand, a pouch will not be able to contain water. Hence, unless a stand is made for it, it is unacceptable.<br>", "In contrast, a sack or a basket - [although] they have been modified - and the holes in them filled with tar to prevent water from flowing out<br>", "may not be used to wash hands. - The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) explains the difference between these and the former two instances:<br>The purpose for which a covering of a jug and a wine pouch are made is related to the containing of liquids. Accordingly, although without modification they cannot serve that purpose in a manner acceptable for use in washing hands, once they are modified they are acceptable. In contrast, a sack or a basket is never used to contain liquids. Therefore, even after modification, it is unacceptable.<br>", "One may not hold water in one's hands and pour it over a colleague's [hands], because one's hands are not a vessel. - See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:6).<br>", "Vessels that have been broken to the extent that the laws of ritual impurity no longer apply to them - <i>Hilchot Keilim</i>, Chapters 6, 11, and 19, relates the following general principle: Once a vessel is broken to the point that it can no longer serve its original purpose, it is no longer considered a vessel and can no longer contract ritual impurity.<br><i>Chulin</i> 107a mentions that a vessel that is used for containing liquids becomes disqualified when it contains a hole large enough to allow liquids to enter when the vessel is placed within them.<br>", "may not be used to wash hands, because they are considered to be broken vessels. - In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo states that the Rambam would consider a vessel acceptable if the hole is on the side and the portion of the vessel below the hole contains more than a <i>revi'it</i> of liquid.<br>In contrast, in his <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159), he explains that the Rambam would disqualify such a utensil because even though it can still contain a sufficient amount of liquid, it is a broken vessel and, as such, unsuitable for use for this mitzvah. In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:1), he rules that a hole on the side disqualifies a vessel unless one is able to pour water through the hole.<br>"], "Blessings 6.12": ["All vessels, even those made from cow dung or earth - e.g., utensils made from mud without being fired in a kiln<br>", "may be used to wash hands - Although utensils made from these substances are not categorized as \"vessels\" with regard to the laws of ritual impurity, they are acceptable for this purpose.<br>", "provided they are whole. - as mentioned in the previous halachah.<br>", "A vessel that cannot contain a revi'it - i.e., is too small to contain this amount of water<br>", "or a vessel that - is of sufficient size to contain this amount, but at the present time<br>", "does not contain a revi'it may not be used for the washing of hands. - This refers to pouring the first amount of water over one's hands. According to our custom of pouring water twice (or three times) over our hands, the second pouring need not contain a <i>revi'it</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 11:8.)<br>"], "Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 1.1": ["During the times of Enosh - the grandson of Adam. See Genesis 4:26, 5:6-11. Enosh lived from the year 235 after creation to the year 1140 (3525 to 2620 B.C.E.).<br>", "mankind made a great mistake and the wise men of that generation gave thoughtless counsel. - Interestingly, the Rambam does not attribute the rise of paganism to simple commoners, but to the \"wise\" of the generation.<br>", "Enosh, himself, was one of those who erred. - Our text of <i>Shabbat</i> 118b mentions that \"the generation of Enosh\" were idol worshipers. However, certain versions of that text omit the words \"generation of.\" (See <i>She'iltot D'Rabbi Achai Gaon, Bereshit</i>.)<br>", "Their mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres - See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 3, for a description of the stars and the spheres, and their place within the Rambam's conception of the cosmos.<br>", "with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him. - i.e., mediums of Divine influence<br>", "Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor. - Rashi finds an allusion to the worship of false gods in Enosh's times in Genesis 4:26: which he renders, \"It was then that they called profanely upon the name of God.\"<br>", "[They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king. - In <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i>, ibid., and in several places in the Guide for the Perplexed, the Rambam explains that the stars and the spheres are on a higher plane than the creations of our world. Though they influence our world, they are also God's creations and have no free will of their own. Thus, they are no more than an axe in the hands of a wood-chopper, and should not worshiped or served.<br>", "After conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to the stars - Note the Rambam's comments on astrology in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7), which are quoted in the commentary on Chapter 11, Halachah 16.<br>", "and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify them with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by doing so, they would - according to their false conception - It is questionable if such worship is forbidden to gentiles or not. Based on Deuteronomy 4:19, certain authorities maintain that the gentiles may worship other gods, provided they have the awareness that God is the ultimate power (\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea\u05d5\u05e3).<br>The Rambam, however, does not mention this perspective in these halachot, nor in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i>, Chapter 9, where he discusses the prohibition against the worship of false gods as it affects gentiles. [In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 2), however, he states \"Israel is commanded regarding the unification of God\"; from which it could be inferred that gentiles need not believe in this concept and can combine their worship of God with other powers.] All authorities agree that such worship is forbidden for Jews.<br>", "be fulfilling the will of God. - It is unclear from the Rambam's statements here whether, originally, they would worship the stars without any self-interest - merely with the intent of honoring those whom God honors - or whether their service was self-oriented - i.e., they worshiped the stars because they considered them as mediums of Divine influence and hoped to derive benefit from of their service. In the following halachah and in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7), the Rambam mentions the second view. It is, however, unclear if this was the original intent of the star-worshipers or whether this was a later development.<br>", "This was the essence of the worship of false gods - See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.<br>", "and this was the rationale of those who worshiped them - at the outset.<br>", "They would never say that there is no other god except for this star - as the pagans mentioned in Halachah 2 later did. The first generations of star worshipers were aware of God's existence and conceived of the stars as no more than intermediaries between ourselves and Him.<br>", "This message was conveyed by Jeremiah, who declared (10:7-8): - See also the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. I, Chapter 36) where the Rambam explains a similar idea using the same Biblical proof-text.<br>", "\"Who will not fear You, King of the nations, for to You it is fitting. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. They have one foolish and senseless [notion. They conceive of their] empty teachings as wood;\" - i.e., as an entity of substance<br>", "i.e., all know that You alone are God. Their foolish error consists of conceiving of this emptiness - the worship of the stars<br><b>as Your will. -</b> This and the following two halachot are somewhat problematic. The Rambam conceived of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as a book of law. He included philosophical and historical points only when they are halachot, directives for our behavior. In this light, this entire chapter seems unnecessary.<br>This difficulty can be resolved based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3, which states that it is forbidden to entertain thoughts of idol worship. Hence, in order to know which thoughts are forbidden, the Rambam feels it necessary to describe the entire thought process which led people to worship idols (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 20).<br>The phenomenon described by the Rambam does not belong entirely to the past. Although, at present, bowing down to the \"stars and spheres\" is not very common - although it has been renewed by some cultists - the theoretical premise that motivated the ancients to serve the stars is still followed by many. Is it all that uncommon to find people who compromise their service of God in expectation of receiving benefits by following what they perceive as the natural order?<br>"], "Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 1.2": ["After many years passed, there arose people - false prophets - Note <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 9:5, which states that anyone who states that God told him in a prophetic vision to worship idols should automatically be considered a false prophet.<br>See also the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. II, Chapter 36) where the Rambam describes how people can be overcome by their powers of imagination to the extent that they - as do others who see them in such a trance - think of themselves as prophets, although, in fact, they received no Divine influence.<br>", "who told [the people] that God had commanded them to say: - Thus, this represents a second stage in the spread of idol worship. At first - as explained in Halachah 1 - star worship was not institutionalized, but was practiced by individuals because of their mistaken conceptions.<br>The second phase involved the development of religious institutions and set modes of worship. The leaders, however, still recognized God and attributed the instructions to worship the stars to Him. In the third stage - as the latter portion of this halachah states - people would worship the stars and idols without any awareness of God.<br>", "Serve this star - or all the stars - sacrifice to it, offer libations to it, build a temple for it and make an image of it so that all people - including the women, the children, and the common people - could bow to it. - See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7) and his statements in Chapter 11, Halachah 16, where he explains that idol worship was instituted by the leaders of the nations to unite the people of a particular land, give them a sense of national identity, and establish a hierarchy of leaders.<br>", "He would inform them of a form that he had conceived, and tell them that this is the image of the particular star, claiming that this was revealed to him in a prophetic vision. - With these statements, the Rambam explains how people began to worship statues and idols. Since the star was far away and could not be perceived as more than a twinkling dot in the sky, the people wanted a more tangible image which they could relate to. The \"prophets\" obliged and devised forms for statues to serve as talismans to bring down influence from these stars.<br>", "In this manner, the people began to make images in temples, under trees, and on the tops of mountains and hills. - Note Deuteronomy 12:2, which commands the Jews to destroy \"all the places where the nations... would worship their gods, on the high mountains, on the hills, or under any luxuriant tree.\" Note the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 45, where the Rambam mentions the gentile practice of building temples on hills and mountaintops.<br>", "People would gather together and bow down to them - the images<br>", "and the [false prophets] would say: This image is the source of benefit or harm. It is appropriate to serve it and fear it. Their priests would tell them: This service will enable you to multiply and be successful. Do this and this, or do not do this or this. - At this stage, their service was clearly self-oriented. They wanted to derive benefit or prevent harm to themselves through this service.<br>", "Subsequently, other deceivers arose and declared that a specific star, sphere, or angel - See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 2, for a description of the angels.<br>", "had spoken to them and commanded them: Serve me in this manner. He would then relate a mode of service [telling them:] Do this, do not do this. - This represented a further descent. Rather than prophesy in the name of God, these imposters would speak in the names of the idols themselves. (See also Chapter 5, Halachot 6-7.)<br>", "Thus, these practices spread throughout the world. People would serve images with strange practices - one more distorted than the other - Note Chapter 3, Halachah 2, which describes the service of Ba'al Pe'or. The people would defecate before the idol as an act of worship.<br>", "offer sacrifices to them, and bow down to them. As the years passed, [God's] glorious and awesome name was forgotten by the entire population. [It was no longer part of] their speech or thought, and they no longer knew Him. - It is not clear at which point in the history of the world this change took place. The period between Enosh's birth and Abraham's lasted slightly more than one thousand years, with the flood taking place approximately 750 years after Enosh's birth.<br>", "Thus, all the common people, the women, and the children would know - Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Chulin</i> 1:1), where he also differentiates between the people who believe in the spiritual service intended to draw down spiritual energy from these celestial bodies and practice it, and the common people who worship the idols blindly, on faith.<br>", "only the image of wood or stone and the temples of stone to which they were trained from their childhood to bow down and serve, and in whose name they swore - i.e., they conceived of the images as gods. Such worship represented more than a mere conceptual error. Six of the seven mitzvot commanded to Noach and his descendants were also given to Adam, the first man. Among them was the prohibition against serving other gods (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1). Thus, by worshiping these images, they were breaking an explicit Divine commandment.<br>", "The wise men among them would - not worship the images as gods in their own right, but they would<br>", "think that there is no God other than the stars and spheres for whose sake, and in resemblance of which, they had made these images. The Eternal Rock - the true God<br>", "was not recognized or known by anyone in the world, with the exception of a [few] individuals - Our Sages speak critically of these individuals, who were themselves righteous, but did nothing to influence the people around them.<br><b>for example -</b> See also the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. II, Chapter 39, where the Rambam cites these individuals as prophets.<br><b>Chanoch -</b> Note Genesis 5:22: \"And Chanoch walked with God.\"<br><b>Metushelach -</b> Though his righteousness is not mentioned explicitly in the Torah, it is mentioned by our Sages in a number of places - e.g., <i>Yalkut Shimeoni, Bereshit</i> 42, which states: \"Metushelach was a completely righteous man.\"<br><b>Noach -</b> See Genesis 6:9: \"And Noach was a righteous man, perfect in his generation.\"<br><b>Shem -</b> Noach's second son.<br><b>and Ever. -</b> Shem and Ever are frequently mentioned by our Rabbis as righteous sages.

Though he was a child, he began to think [incessantly] throughout the day and night, wondering: How is it possible for the sphere to continue to revolve without having anyone controlling it? - Note the <i>Midrash HaGadol</i> (<i>Parashat Lech Lecha</i>), which explains that Abraham questioned: Why should we bow down to idols, gods that we ourselves make? We should bow to the earth, for it produces crops that sustain us.<br>Therefore, he began to worship the earth. Then he saw that the earth needs rain, and began to worship the sky. Later, he saw that the most brilliant creation in the sky was the sun, and began to worship it. Afterwards, when the sun set and the moon rose, he began to worship the moon. When the sun rose the next morning, he did not know what to do. He did not see which was stronger: the sun or the moon. So Abraham continued in a quandary, questioning who was the true God.<br>", "Who is causing it to revolve? Surely, it does not cause itself to revolve. - Interestingly, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:5, the Rambam uses the same concept as a proof for the existence of God.<br>He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. -<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 61:1 elaborates on the lack of instruction that was available to Abraham.<br>Note the Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who question why Noach, Shem, and Ever (all of whom were alive at this time) did not try to nullify the worship of idols and why they did not instruct Abraham. They offer two explanations. The first is that they were afraid and hid from the idolaters. (See <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 118. Note, however, teachings which state that these righteous men also protested the worship of false gods, <i>Tanna Devei Eliyahu Rabba</i>, Chapters 20 and 25.)<br>Alternatively, Shem and Ever lived in the land of Canaan, while Abraham lived in Babylon. The question remains, however, why did Abraham not seek out these righteous men (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).<br>", "Rather, he was mired in Ur Kasdim among the foolish idolaters. His father, mother, and all the people [around him] were idol worshipers - Indeed, our Sages relate that his father had a shop where idols were sold.<br>", "and he would worship with them. - See <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:8, which states that Abraham was always worried that God would not absolve him from his sin of worshiping idols.<br>", "[However,] his heart was exploring and [gaining] understanding. Ultimately, he appreciated the way of truth - an awareness of God<br>", "and understood the path of righteousness - an ethical approach to behavior, which reflected his spiritual awareness<br>", "through his accurate comprehension. He realized that there was one God who controlled the sphere, that He created everything, and that there is no other God among all the other entities. - These are the fundamental principles of the Jewish faith, as explained in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:1-6.<br>", "He knew that the entire world was making a mistake. What caused them to err was their service of the stars and images, which made them lose awareness of the truth. - Their worship of idols dulled their sensitivity to spirituality to the point where they lost all awareness of God.<br>", "Abraham was forty years old when he became aware of his Creator. - Note <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 64:4, which mentions two opinions regarding when Abraham became aware of God: one when he was three and one when he was forty eight. It is possible that the Rambam's text of the Midrash read \"forty\" instead of \"forty eight.\"<br>As explained above, the opinions are not necessarily contradictory. Abraham's process of inquiry could have begun at age three, while at forty he gained greater understanding, and at forty eight, he achieved an even higher level of awareness.<br><i>Avot</i> 5:21 states: \"At forty, one achieves understanding.\" By associating Abraham's apreciation of the Creator with this age, the Rambam implies that this awareness can come as a product of our own thought and meditation.<br>", "When he recognized and knew Him - <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:1 explains Abraham's process of thought with a parable. A person saw a brightly lit palace. He wondered: Could this palace exist without an owner? Immediately, the owner revealed himself to him. Similarly, Abraham wondered: Is it possible for the world to exist without one who controls? Immediately, God revealed himself to him.<br>", "he began to formulate replies to the inhabitants of Ur Kasdim and debate with them, telling them that they were not following a proper path - by serving the stars and idols.<br>", "He broke their idols and began to teach the people that it is fitting to serve only the God of the world. - Our Sages relate that after breaking his father's idols, he put a stick in the hands of the largest idol. When his father asked him why he destroyed the idols, he replied that he didn't do it; the idol holding the stick did.<br>His father curtly dismissed his reply: \"That idol is only metal. It cannot do anything,\" he roared at his son.<br>\"If so, why do you worship it?\" Abraham replied.<br>", "To Him [alone] is it fitting to bow down, sacrifice, and offer libations, so that the people of future [generations] would recognize Him. - The Rambam's words imply that the value of offering sacrifices at this time (before the Torah commanded that they be offered) was not as the acts of service of God, but in the educational effect they had on the people and the awareness of God they inspired.<br>", "[Conversely,] it is fitting to destroy and break all the images, lest all the people err concerning them, like those people who thought that there are no other gods besides these [images].

A number of sources in the oral tradition (<i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer</i>, Chapter 39; <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 15:27), however, reveal this concept.<br><b>He established him [as the head of] the academy -</b> The <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> (<i>Vayigash</i>) interprets Genesis 46:28: \"And Jacob sent Judah before him,\" to mean that he charged him with founding a yeshiva. Similarly, <i>Yoma</i> 28b states that this Talmudic academy continued throughout the Egyptian exile.<br><b>to teach them the way of God -</b> Note <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 1:7, which explains that the expression, \"the way of God,\" refers to ethics, emulating the qualities of spirit which God has revealed.<br><b>and observe the mitzvot of Abraham. -</b> In this context, note the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1. After relating the seven universal laws given to Noach and his descendants, the Rambam states:<br>In addition to these, Abraham was commanded regarding circumcision. He instituted the morning prayer. Isaac separated tithes and added another prayer service towards evening. Jacob added the prohibition against eating the <i>gid hanasheh</i>, the \"displaced nerve,\" and instituted the evening prayers.<br><b>[Jacob] commanded his sons that the leadership should not depart from the descendants of Levi -</b> Thus, the mantle of leadership passed to Kehat and then to Amram, Moses' father.<br><b>so that the teachings would not be forgotten. This concept proceeded and gathered strength among the descendants of Jacob and those who collected around them, until there became a nation within the world which knew God. -</b> This describes the initial period of the Jews' stay in Egypt, when they prospered both spiritually and materially.<br><b>When the Jews extended their stay in Egypt -</b> The entire period of the Egyptian exile lasted 210 years. As long as Jacob's sons were living, the Jews preserved the heritage of their fathers and were treated with honor by the Egyptians.<br>The last of Jacob's sons to die was Levi. After his death, the spiritual level of the Jews descended. Levi lived 127 years. He was 44 when he entered Egypt. Thus, this spiritual descent occurred 83 years after the Jews entered Egypt.<br><b>however, they learned from the [Egyptians'] deeds and began worshiping the stars as they did -</b> When the Jews adopted Egyptian values - as a reflection of their spiritual state - they were enslaved by the Egyptians.<br><b>with the exception of the tribe of Levi, who clung to the mitzvot of the patriarchs - the tribe of Levi never served false gods. -</b> The tribe of Levi was also the only tribe which perpetuated the mitzvah of circumcision (<i>Sifre, Berachah</i>). As a result of their spiritual fortitude, the tribe of Levi was never enslaved.<br><b>Within a short time, the fundamental principle that Abraham had planted would have been uprooted and the descendants of Jacob would have returned to the errors of the world and their crookedness. -</b> Our Sages relate that, in the Egyptian exile, the Jews had descended to the forty-ninth degree of impurity. Had they descended another level, it would have been impossible for us ever to be redeemed.<br><b>Because of God's love for us, and to uphold the oath He made to Abraham, our patriarch -</b> This is a reference to Deuteronomy 7:7-8: \"It is not because of your greatness over all the other nations that God desired you and chose you..., but it was because of God's love for you and because He kept the oath He swore to your fathers.\"<br><b>He brought forth Moses, our teacher -</b> Rav David Arameah notes that the word \u05e2\u05e9\u05d4, rendered as \"brought forth,\" literally means \"made.\" He explains that from Moses' birth, God granted him the potential to develop unique spiritual awareness. Although the Rambam also accepts this concept (see the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. II, Chapter 32), it is more likely that he chose this expression as a reference to I Samuel 12:6 (Rav Kapach).<br><b>the master of all prophets -</b> See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 7:6, where the Rambam elaborates on the advantages Moses had over all the other prophets. Indeed, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (Introduction to Chapter 10 of <i>Sanhedrin</i>), he includes belief in the supremacy of Moses' prophecy as the seventh of his Thirteen Principles of Faith.<br><b>and sent him [to redeem the Jews] -</b> after 117 years of idol worship and slavery.<br><b>After Moses, our teacher, prophesied, and God chose Israel as His inheritance, He crowned them with mitzvot and informed them of the path to serve Him -</b> by<br><b>[teaching them] -</b> the Torah which reveals<br><b>the judgement prescribed for idol-worship and all those who stray after it -</b> as will be explained in the subsequent chapters. The Rambam's elaboration on the negative experience of our people in Egypt and the giving of the Torah has the following implication. Although man can appreciate the futile nature of idol worship and the greatness of God with his own intellect, because man is fallable, it is necessary to have these principles institutionalized in an objective, unchanging religious code (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 20).<br>"], "Fringes 1.1": ["The tassel that is made on the fringes of a garment - The word <i>anaf</i>, translated as \"tassel,\" literally means \"branch.\" Just as a branch is an extension of the tree, the tzitzit are extensions of the fringes.<br>", "from the same fabric as the garment - See Chapter 3, Halachah 5.<br>", "is called tzitzit - in Numbers 15:38-39.

Though there are some sources that appear to indicate that the Torah also fixed the number of strands required, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 88b concludes that the essence of the mitzvah of tzitzit is a Torah obligation; its explanation, however, is Rabbinic in origin.<br>Significantly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:12) rules that if one includes more than eight strands in tzitzit, they are unacceptable. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:1 goes further and states that by doing so, one violates the prohibition forbidding adding to a Torah commandment.

This strand is called techelet. - The Rambam discusses the nature of this dye and its preparation in Chapter 2.<br>", "The Torah did not establish a fixed requirement for the number of times that this strand should be wound [around the tassel]. - <i>Menachot</i> 39a requires that the strand of <i>techelet</i> be wound at least seven times around the tassel, as explained in Halachah 8.

(See <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 4:4.) As explained in the following halachah, however, unlike tefillin, they are counted as one mitzvah and not two.<br>", "What is implied? A person who does not have techelet should make [tzitzit] from white strands alone. - This is the practice in the present age, when we do not know how to obtain <i>techelet</i>. Even in Talmudic times, when <i>techelet</i> was available, it was very expensive, and many of the common people made their tzitzit without it.<br>", "Similarly, if [tzitzit] were made from both white strands and techelet, and afterwards, the white strands snapped and were reduced until [they did not extend beyond] the corner [of the garment] - The explanation of the Rambam's statements has been debated by the commentaries. Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Menachot</i> 4:1.<br>", "and thus only the techelet remained, it is acceptable. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> emphasizes that the Rambam does not accept tzitzit that were made from <i>techelet</i> without any white strands. Since the verse states, \"and you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand of <i>techelet</i>,\" there must be tassels of white strands around which to wind the <i>techelet</i>.

One begins from the corner of a garment - i.e., the end of its woven portion. - The tzitzit must be placed at the \"corners\" or the \"fringes\" of the garment.<br>", "One ascends upward no more than three fingerbreadths from the edge - Any further distance upward would be considered part of the garment itself and not its \"corner\" or \"fringe\" (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 11:9).<br>", "but no less than the distance from the knuckle of the thumb to its end. - This is approximately two fingerbreadths. Any lower would be considered as \"below the fringe\" and not \"on the fringe\" (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:16).<br>Other opinions mention that these distances should also be applied in regard to the space between the hole and the side of the garment. It is customary to follow this view (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:10).<br>", "[A hole is made] and four strands inserted, [causing them] to be folded in half. Thus, there will be eight strands hanging down from the corner. - As mentioned in Halachah 1, the Torah does not explicitly mention the number of strands in the tzitzit. Although <i>Menachot</i> 39b derives this concept from the exegesis of Deuteronomy 22:12, the Rambam considers this process of derivation to be Rabbinic in origin (\u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9 \u05e1\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd).<br>", "These eight strands must be at least four fingerbreadths long. - This decision is based on the Rambam's interpretation of<i>Menachot</i> 39a and 41b. Based on the same sources, Rabbenu Tam requires that the strands be at least twelve fingerbreadths long. His opinion is accepted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:4) and the later authorities.<br>", "If they are longer - even if they are a cubit or two long - it is acceptable. - It is common to make the strands slightly longer than twelve fingerbreadths, so that, even if they tear, they will still retain the desired length (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:9; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 11:21).<br>", "The term \"fingerbreadth\" refers to a thumbbreadth. - See <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i> 9:9.

The other half should retain its natural color, white.<br>The Ra'avad disagrees with this point and maintains that one of the larger strands should be dyed in its entirety, thus producing two smaller strands that are dyed <i>techelet</i>. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 10) and other Ashkenazic authorities maintain that two of the four strands were <i>techelet</i> and two were white.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's position, noting that Numbers 15:39 states, \"And you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand (singular) of <i>techelet</i>.\" Note also the commentary of the <i>Or Sameach</i>.<br>Significantly, archaeological excavations have uncovered tzitzit belonging to bar Kochba's soldiers. Only one of the eight strands was dyed <i>techelet</i>.<br>", "the other seven should be white. - The dyed strand should be slightly longer than the others, so that, even after it has been wound around them, it will be the same length as the others.<br>"], "Fringes 1.11": ["Both the white strands of the tzitzit and those dyed techelet must be spun for the sake of being used for [the mitzvah of] tzitzit. - i.e., before one begins spinning the strands, one must state that he is doing so for the sake of use for tzitzit.<br>As explained in <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 1:11, any time when an activity must be carried out <i>lishmah</i>, it cannot be performed by a gentile. Therefore, the strands may not be spun by a gentile alone (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 11:1).<br>", "[Tzitzit] may not be made from wool which becomes attached to thorns when sheep graze among them, nor from hairs which are pulled off the animal, and not from the leftover strands of the woof which the weaver leaves over when he completes a garment. - Tzitzit must be made from the same fabric as that which was used for the garment to which they are attached. Since these three sorts of wool are of an inferior quality and are not suitable for use in a garment itself, they may not be used for tzitzit either (<i>Sefer HaMaor, Sukkah</i>).<br>", "Rather, they must be made from shorn wool or from flax.<br>", "[Tzitzit] may not be made from wool which was stolen - Numbers 15:38 states: \"And you shall make tzitzit for yourselves.\" The latter term implies that the tzitzit must belong to their owner and may not be stolen.<br>One of the principles of Jewish law is that if the form of a stolen article is altered and its original owner gives up hope of its return, it is acquired by the thief, and he is required merely to return its worth, but not the article itself. Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:12 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 11:30, which discuss the implications of this principle on the use of stolen wool for tzitzit.<br>", "which came from an ir hanidachat - An <i>ir hanidachat</i> is a city condemned to be destroyed because the majority of its inhabitants worshiped idols.

Tzitzit can be made only from wool that belongs \"to you.\" Once an animal is designated for sacrificial purposes, it is no longer considered as belonging to a private individual (<i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>).<br>", "If such wool was used, it is unacceptable.<br>", "If a person bows down to an animal, its wool is not acceptable for use for tzitzit. - In contrast to other objects worshiped as false deities, an animal does not become condemned and may be used for other purposes (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:1). Nevertheless, wool of this nature is unfit to use for a ritual purpose. (See <i>Hilchot Issurei HaMizbe'ach</i> 3:6.)<br>", "If, however, one bows down to flax which is planted, it is acceptable - for use as tzitzit<br>", "because it has been changed - and no longer resembles the object which was worshiped.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 14:1) does not accept this opinion. The Ramah, however, states that it is preferable for women not to tie tzitzit.<br>", "If, however, a Jew made tzitzit without the intention [that they be used for the mitzvah], they are acceptable. - This principle can be derived from the above concept. Were it necessary for the tzitzit to be tied with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah, there would be no need for a special verse from the Torah to teach that those made by a gentile are unacceptable. The concept would be self-explanatory. Whenever a deed must be performed with a specific intention, a gentile's acts are not acceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The Ashkenazic authorities do not accept this premise and maintain that, at the very least, the strands must be attached to the garment with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 14:2.)<br>", "Tzitzit that are made from those already existing are not acceptable. - This principle is explained and illustrated in detail in the following four halachot.<br>"], "Reading the Shema 1.1": ["We [are obligated to] recite the Shema twice daily, in the evening and in the morning - as [Deuteronomy 6:7] states: \"...when you lie down and when you rise\" - In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 10), the Rambam mentions the beginning of this verse, \u05d5\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea \u05d1\u05dd... (And you shall speak of them...) as the source for the mitzvah of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.<br>Nevertheless, his statements in this halachah do not necessarily represent a change of mind. Here, the Rambam is not interested in the actual source for the mitzvah itself (which is the case in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>), but in stating our obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> twice daily, once at night and once in the daytime. This is derived from the end of the verse, as mentioned by the Rambam.<br>", "in the evening and in the morning - The obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> at night is mentioned first both in the Mishnah,<i>Berachot</i> 1:1 and here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, following the pattern mentioned in the verse quoted above: \"...when you lie down and when you rise.\"<br><i>Berachot</i> 3a understands this order as parallel to the creation of the world itself which began: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05e2\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d4\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e7\u05e8 (And then there was night and there was day..., Genesis 1:5 .

However, based on the above verse, <i>Beit Shammai</i> obligates one to recline while reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night, and to stand while reciting it in the morning. <i>Beit Hillel</i> holds that the verse simply establishes the general times at which the <i>Shema</i> is recited, as stated by the Rambam in this halachah; i.e., at the time that people sleep and at the time that they are accustomed to wake up.<br>"], "Reading the Shema 1.2": ["And what is it that one recites? - There are various opinions as to what constitutes the positive commandment of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Commandment 419) states clearly that the Torah obligates us to read only the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> - i.e., <i>Shema Yisrael</i>. The reading of the rest of the three sections was instituted by the Sages.<br>Rabbenu Yonah understands that the whole first section constitutes the Torah obligation. (See <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 63 at the end.) There is also an opinion that the obligation to recite the first two sections originates in the Torah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 58.) However, in practice, everyone ultimately agrees that one must recite all three sections mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah (<i>Berachot</i> 13a).<br>", "These three sections: \"Hear O Israel...\" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9), \"And if you will listen...\" (Deuteronomy 11:13-21) and \"And God said...\" (Numbers 15:37-41). - For, as explained, each of these paragraphs contains fundamental concepts central to the Jewish faith.<br>Note <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Commandment 420) who quotes the Rambam, not to explain the order of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but rather to clarify why the Sages included these three sections in the <i>Shema</i>.<br>we begin with the section of \"Hear O Israel...\" - <i>Berachot</i> 13a, 14b, offers two different explanations regarding the order of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, does not quote either explicitly, but rather seems to suggest his own reason.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> holds that the Rambam's explanation of the order of the first two sections, \"Hear O Israel\" and \"And if you will listen,\" is in fact consistent with the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 13a. Regarding the last section, the Rambam desired to supply us with both the reason for its inclusion and its placement after the second section (even though the third section precedes it in the Torah itself).<br>", "since it contains [the concept of] the unity of God - The statement \"God is our Lord, God is one\" implies not only that there is only one God, but all creation is one with Him. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:6.<br>", "[the commandment of] loving Him - \"And you shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength\" (Deuteronomy 6:5 .<br>", "the study of Torah - \"... and you shall teach your children and speak of them\" (Deuteronomy 6:7 .<br>It must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i>, the Rambam quotes Deuteronomy 11:19 (a verse in the second section of the <i>Shema</i>), as the source for the mitzvah of Torah study.<br>", "it being a fundamental principle upon which everything is based - This refers to the concept of the unity of God. (See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:6.)<br>", "After it [we read] \"And if you will listen...,\" since it contains the imperative to fulfill the rest of the commandments - \"And if you will listen to all my commandments...\" (Deuteronomy 11:13 . This section also contains the commandment of loving God (verse 13) and the study of Torah (verse 19). It is, however, the mention of \"all the commandments\" which distinguishes this section as separate and unique from the first section.<br>and finally the portion of tzitzit, since it also contains the imperative of remembering all the commandments - \"And you shall see them (<i>tzitzit</i> - the fringes on the corners of four-cornered garments) and remember all the commandments of God and do them\" (Numbers 15:39 .<br>Rashi, in his commentary on the above verse, explains how <i>tzitzit</i> serve as a reminder of all the Torah's commandments. The numerical value of the Hebrew word \u05e6\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05ea is 600 (\u05e6 = 90 \u05d9 = 10 \u05e6 = 90 \u05d9 = 10 \u05ea = 400) There are also eight strings and five knots. Therefore, by looking at the <i>tzitzit</i>, one is reminded of the 613 divine commandments.<br>"], "Reading the Shema 1.3": ["The commandment of tzitzit is not obligatory at night - Numbers 15:39 states: \"And you shall see them...\" - implying that <i>tzitzit</i> must only be worn when they can be seen, i.e., daytime. Accordingly, there is no obligation to wear <i>tzitzit</i> at night. See <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:7-8.<br>", "Nevertheless, we recite [the section describing] it at night because it mentions the exodus from Egypt - \"I am God, your Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt to be your Lord, I am God, your Lord\" (Numbers 15:41 .<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the mention of the exodus can itself be understood as the reason for the inclusion of this section in <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, mentions <i>tzitzit</i> as the basis for the presence of this section in <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (see Halachah 2), since it is the <i>tzitzit</i> that cause us to remember all the commandments.<br>", "We are commanded to mention the exodus from Egypt both during the day and at night - See <i>Berachot</i> 12b.<br>It is interesting to note that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam does not count the mentioning of the exodus from Egypt as one of the 613 commandments in the Torah, nor does he mention it elsewhere in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.<br>The Rambam does, however, count the commandment of the telling of the story of the exodus on the fifteenth of <i>Nisan</i> - i.e., Passover night - as one of the mitzvot. See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 157), <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 21), and <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i>, Chapters 7 and 8.<br>According to some opinions, one can differentiate between the two obligations as follows: A person can fulfill his daily obligation with simply a thought about the exodus, whereas on <i>Pesach</i> night the mitzvah can be performed only through the verbal description of the redemption from Egypt. (See <i>Sha'agat Aryeh</i>, 13.)<br>This would explain the omission of this commandment from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. A commandment that can be fulfilled with a thought alone and not an explicit statement or action is not \"worthy\" of inclusion in the list of 613 commandments of the Torah. (See the Rambam's explanation of the commandment to remember Amalek: Positive Commandment 189).<br>The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>, however, disagrees with this opinion. In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 67, he states that even the daily obligation requires an explicit statement. Nevertheless, he explains that it was not chosen as one of the 613 commandments because the obligation to remember the exodus twice daily is not stated in the form of a command in the Torah to \"Remember,\" but rather, as a reason for another mitzvah (the mitzvah of <i>matzah</i>): \"In order that you shall remember...\" (Deuteronomy 16:3 .<br>", "all the days of your life - The word \"all\" includes even the nighttime.<br>The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshat Vayakhel</i> 216b) explains the mystical significance of mentioning the exodus from Egypt after proclaiming the unity of God.<br>", "The reading of these three sections in this order constitutes the recitation of the Shema. - The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:5) mentions that the sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> also contain a reference to each of the 10 utterances of the revelation at Mount Sinai (Exodus 20:1-14), thus representing a complete statement of Jewish spirituality and values.<br>"], "Reading the Shema 1.4": ["When reciting the Shema, after completing the first verse, one says quietly: \"Blessed be the name of the glory of His Kingdom forever.\" - This phrase is recited quietly because it is not part of the section of the <i>Shema</i> as it appears in the Torah, but rather was recited by Jacob in Egypt, as explained later in this halachah.<br>It is, however, pronounced loudly on Yom Kippur. <i>Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer</i> explains that the angels praise God with this verse. On Yom Kippur, we are as pure as angels and thus, emulate their practice (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).<br>It is preferable to separate clearly between the end of \"Blessed be the name\" - i.e., the words \u05dc\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 - forever, and the beginning of the next section, \u05d5\u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05ea (And you shall love...) (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 61).<br>", "He then continues to read the first section. Why do we read it in this fashion? - i.e., Why do we include this verse of \"Blessed be the name...,\" since it is not part of the section of the Torah beginning with \"<i>Shema Yisrael</i>...\"<br>", "It is our tradition that when the patriarch, Jacob, gathered all his sons together in Egypt close to his death - See Genesis, Chapter 49.<br>", "he commanded and urged them regarding the Unity of God and the path of God upon which Abraham and Isaac, his father, had tread. - This narrative can be found in <i>Pesachim</i> 56a.<br>", "He asked them: \"My sons, perhaps there are dregs among you, one who does not stand with me in the Unity of God?\" - What would cause Jacob to have such a doubt regarding his children? One of the greatest merits of Jacob is that he - unlike Avraham, who fathered Yishmael, and Yitzchak, who had Esau as a son - had only righteous children.<br><i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains that Jacob desired to reveal the secret of the end of days to his children, but that this knowledge suddenly left him. He was worried that perhaps his sudden lack of understanding was due to the imperfect state of his children and therefore, felt compelled to ask them about their faith in the One God.<br>The Rambam omits all these particulars, since they are not relevant to the matter at hand - namely, the source of the custom of saying \"Blessed be the name...\" after \"<i>Shema Yisrael</i>...\"<br>", "This is comparable to the manner in which Moses, our teacher, said to us: \"Lest there be among you a man or woman [whose heart turns this day from God...]\" - The Rambam adds this in order to teach us the nature of Jacob's doubts. He was not casting aspersions on the behavior of his sons, since he knew that their deeds were righteous. He was, however, worried that perhaps one of them had a mistaken understanding regarding the unity of God. This is in line with the verse the Rambam quotes. Moses is not chastising the Jewish people for their actions, but rather warning them of the possibility that there might be someone with a lack of faith that could lead to blasphemy later (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "They all answered and said: \"Listen, Israel, - Jacob is also called by that name (Genesis 32:29 .<br>", "God is our Lord, God is One,\" i.e., listen to us, Israel, our father, God is our Lord, God is One.", "The wise elder responded: - Praising God for the fortune of having righteous children;<br>", "\"Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever.\" Therefore, the Jews are accustomed to utter the praise that Israel, the wise elder, uttered after this verse.", "Commentary, Halachah 5", "Blessings are recited before and after Kri'at Shema. - See the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 11a.<br>", "In the day, one recites two blessings before it and one after it. At night, one recites two blessings before and two blessings after it. - There are a total of seven blessings associated with the reading of the <i>Shema</i>, three in the day and four at night. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:5) bases this on the verse \"Seven (times) in the day will I praise you\" (Psalms 119:164 .<br>The <i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 49, discusses the reasons for these blessings at length, noting that, on the surface, they are not related to the <i>Shema</i> at all. That text explains that the basic intent of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is to attain the love for God as described in the verse, \"And you shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength.\"<br>To reach such a level, one must first contemplate the greatness of God. Accordingly, in the first blessing, we outline the praises of God uttered by the angels, who are of supreme intelligence and spiritual wisdom. These lofty creatures proclaim God's greatness and abnegate themselves completely to Him, stating that He transcends even their ability to understand.<br>Then, in the second blessing, we describe God's great love for the Jewish people, as manifested by His giving us His Torah and choosing us as His people.<br>Having contemplated such ideas, we are prepared to reciprocate God's love for us by proclaiming our love for Him. We recognize His infinite Greatness and Unity, see His Providence in the events of our life, and internalize our intellectual understanding into an emotional outpouring for our Creator.<br>"], "Reading the Shema 1.6": ["[The Shema] is followed by [the section beginning] \"True and certain...\" - affirming the truth of the statements mentioned in the <i>Shema</i>.<br>", "At night, the first blessing preceding [the Shema begins: \"Blessed are You, God...], the One who brings the evening,...\" and the second [begins with] \"With everlasting love, You have loved Your people Israel.\" The first blessing after [the Shema] is [the section begining] \"True and faithful...\" - These blessings parallel the content of the three blessings recited in the morning.<br>", "and the second [begins] \"Lay us down...\" - in preparation for going to sleep.<br>"], "Reading the Shema 1.7": ["The first blessing preceding it, both in the day and at night, begins \"Blessed [are You, God our Lord...]\" and concludes \"Blessed [are You, God...]\" - The first blessing in a series of blessings generally possesses a <i>p'tichah</i>, as well as a <i>chatimah</i>. Other examples of this are the first blessing in the silent <i>Amidah</i> prayer and the blessing with which we begin grace after meals.<br>", "The rest of the blessings all conclude with \"Blessed [are]...\", but do not begin \"Blessed [are]...\" - A blessing which immediately follows another as part of a series of blessings is not introduced with a <i>p'tichah</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a). The paragraphs of \"True and certain\" and \"True and faithful\" are also considered as blessings that follow another blessing, even though the <i>Kri'at Shema</i> itself would seem to constitute an interruption. Therefore, these blessings need not begin with a <i>p'tichah</i>, but simply conclude with the standard <i>chatimah</i>: Blessed are You, God (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 36a).[<br>The Rambam discusses only the concepts of <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i> and omits the second category of blessings mentioned in the Mishnah and <i>Tosefta</i> (i.e., long and short blessings). This seems to indicate that he equated a long blessing with that which has a <i>p'tichah</i> and a <i>chatimah</i>, and a short blessing with one that has only a <i>chatimah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). In fact, in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 11a), the Rambam writes that even a long blessing has a <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i>, and a short one has only one of the above.<br>In contrast, Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 11a) holds that the distinction between long and short blessings is a matter of length only, irrespective of <i>p'tichot</i> and <i>chatimot</i>. He defines the blessing of \u05d0\u05de\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 - \"True and faithful\" - (the first blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night) as a long blessing, and \"Lay us down\" (the last blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night) to be a short blessing, even though they both have only a <i>chatimah</i> and no <i>p'tichah</i>.]<br>", "These blessings and all the rest of the blessings familiar to the Jewish people were instituted by Ezra, the scribe, and his court - This is a general statement. In particular, there are some blessings that were not established by Ezra, but rather by the Sages of the Mishnah. See <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 2:1 and <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 2:1.<br>", "One may not detract from them or add to them.", "In every instance that they decreed to conclude with \"Blessed...\" - e.g., all the blessings of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, the silent <i>Amidah</i> prayer and grace after meals.

Only when one deviates from the <i>p'tichah</i> or <i>chatimah</i> of a blessing does the Rambam require the recitation of another blessing. However, a person who maintains the nature of the <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i>, but changes the wording of the rest of the blessing, fulfills his obligation as long as the basic intent of the blessing remains.<br>", "Anyone who does not say [the paragraph of] \"True and certain...\" in the morning prayer or [the paragraph of] \"True and faithful...\" in the evening prayer - <i>Berachot</i> 12a derives this from Psalms 92:3: \"To relate Your lovingkindness in the morning and Your faithfulness at night.\" Rashi explains that \u05d5\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d0\u05de\u05ea, \"True and certain\" (which is recited after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in the morning) is necessary, since it tells of God's infinite lovingkindness in taking our forefathers out of Egypt and splitting the Red Sea.<br>\u05d0\u05de\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 (True and faithful) (which is recited at night) chronicles our hopes and beliefs regarding our future, that God will fulfill His promise to redeem us from the exile and restore us to a vibrant life of freedom. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 66) explains that \u05d0\u05de\u05ea \u05d5\u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 (True and faithful) could also refer to our faith that God will return our soul, which we put in His trust every night, to us.<br>", "does not fulfill his obligation - Rav Hai Gaon holds that the blessings of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> are an integral and necessary part of the fulfillment of the commandment. Therefore, he explains <i>Berachot</i> 12a as saying that one who does not say <i>Emet v'yatziv</i> has not fulfilled his obligation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and must therefore recite it again. The Rambam appears to accept this opinion.<br>However, the vast majority of the <i>Rishonim</i> are of the opinion that a person can fulfill his obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> even if he does not recite the blessings. The above passage, therefore, is to be understood as teaching that one has not performed the mitzvah in its proper fashion if he omits the blessings.<br>Both the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 66:10) reflect this understanding. They add the word \"properly\" at the end of this halachah: \"One who does not say <i>Emet v'yatziv</i>, etc., does not fulfill his obligation properly.

The commandment [starts] from the time of the appearance of the stars... - The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) states that the time for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> begins at the hour when a priest who has become ritually impure may immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> and resume eating <i>terumah</i>. The Talmud explains that this is the time when the stars appear.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) holds that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited earlier, during the last hour before sunset. This is based on the understanding that Rabbi Yehudah, who disagrees with the majority opinion regarding the proper time for the afternoon prayer, also disagrees about the proper time for the evening prayer and <i>Kri'at Shema</i> contained therein. (See <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 235.) This will be discussed at length in <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 3:6.<br>There are several different positions regarding the precise definition of \u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd (the appearance of the stars). It generally refers to the appearance of three medium-sized stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 235:1 requires the sighting of three small stars before reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that the basic halachah is indeed that three medium sized stars constitute the time of \u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd, but that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> obligated one to wait for smaller stars in order to diminish the possibility of error regarding the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night.<br>There are three basic positions regarding the actual time of \u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd (the appearance of the stars). <i>Shabbat</i> 34b determines that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset.<br>The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a: one defines \u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.<br>There are two different methods of determining the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary to the mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 3:2, maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i> - is that the measure of time is 18 minutes.<br>Therefore, according to <i>Shabbat</i> 34b, the appearance of the stars is 13 1/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that \u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd is determined in this fashion. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the Equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset in order to be certain.<br>According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> strongly suggests adhering to the position that \u05e6\u05d0\u05ea \u05d4\u05db\u05d5\u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Siman 24), mentions only the position of the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> on the other.<br>", "[and continues] until midnight - There are three positions recorded in the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 2a regarding the time until which one may recite the <i>Shema</i> at night.<br>Rabbi Eliezer says until the end of the first of the three watches of the Temple - i.e., one third of the night, which is until approximately 9:30 pm. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. The Mishnah then explains that the Sages' opinion is, in effect, that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> until dawn, but that they mentioned midnight as a preferred time in order to distance people from transgression. This is the source of this halachah in the Rambam.<br>The <i>Rosh</i> and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 235) hold that the halachah follows Rabban Gamliel's position, and that a priori (\u05dc\u05db\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4), a person may read the <i>Shema</i> at night until dawn. The Rambam sees the Sages' position as halachically valid, and therefore one may rely on Rabban Gamliel only after the fact (\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 235:3 quotes the Rambam's position. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah 235:34-35.)<br></i><br>A person who transgresses and delays - the Rabbinic decree that the <i>Shema</i> should be read before midnight.<br>", "fulfills his obligation if he recites [the Shema] before dawn. - In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1), the Rambam defines dawn (\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05d7\u05e8) as the light that radiates from the east before sunrise.<br>There are three major positions regarding this time. All are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 94a which defines the time from dawn until sunrise as that in which a person can walk either 4 <i>mil</i> (according to one opinion) or 5 <i>mil</i> (according to the other).<br>As mentioned above, there are two opinions regarding the measure of time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>: 18 minutes or 24 minutes. Thus, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi defines dawn as 120 (5 x 24) minutes before sunrise. The most widely held view is that it is 90 (5 x 18) minutes before sunrise, while the <i>Beit Yosef</i> holds that dawn is 72 (4 x 18) minutes before sunrise. This is the opinion of the Rambam, as stated in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)<br>", "[The Sages established the limit] of midnight only in order to distance us from negligent wrongdoing. - <i>Berachot</i> 1:1 lists other instances where the Sages established similar guidelines, e.g., partaking of sacrificial meat, burning sacrificial limbs."], "Reading the Shema 1.10": ["[but] before sunrise - the last possible time that could be defined as night<br>", "does not fulfill his obligation unless he was unavoidably detained - e.g., drunk or sick, or in a similar situation. -<br>Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said in the name of Rabbi Akiva: \"Sometimes a person can recite the <i>Shema</i> twice in the day, once before sunrise and once after sunrise, and fulfill his obligation - once for the day and once for the night.\"Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: \"The law follows [the statement of] Rabbi Shimon in the name of Rabbi Akiva.\" Rav Zeira says: \"This is so, provided that he does not say [the paragraph of] \"Lay us down\" (<i>Berachot</i> 8b-9a).<br>The Talmud explains that Rabbi Shimon's statement only applies when a person is unavoidably detained. The evening <i>Shema</i> must be recited \"when you lie down.\" The Torah left the definition of that term to the Rabbis. The latter maintained that a person who intentionally delays the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> cannot recite it after dawn. However, they were more lenient in regard to a person who was unavoidably detained and gave him until sunrise.<br>", "A person who was so detained and reads [the Shema] at this time does not recite [the blessing of] \"Lay us down.\" - for this is not a time when a person lays himself down to sleep. Nevertheless, one does recite the other blessings related to <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night (two before and one after it).<br>"], "Reading the Shema 1.11": ["When is the proper time [for the recitation of the Shema] during the day? The commandment is that one should start to read before sunrise - The Mishnah, (<i>Berachot</i> 9b) records a disagreement regarding the time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in the morning.<br>An anonymous position sees the earliest possible time as when one can distinguish between <i>techelet</i> (blue-green) and white. Rabbi Eliezer says: Between green and blue-green - i.e., later - and that the time lasts until sunrise. Rabbi Yehoshua says that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> \"until three hours.\"<br>The Talmud then adds various other opinions and quotes Abaye as saying that the <i>Shema</i> should be recited \u05db\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05e7\u05d9\u05df - i.e., one should finish reciting the <i>Shema</i> as the sun rises, in order to start the silent <i>Amidah</i> with the sunrise.<br>The Rambam clearly prefers this position and establishes 6 minutes as a reasonable amount of time to recite the <i>Shema</i> and the blessing after it, in order to start the <i>Amidah</i> at the proper time. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 58:1) explains that all opinions agree that the commandment to recite <i>Shema</i> in the morning begins at dawn. The only disagreement revolves around the optimum time to recite <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.

The <i>Magen Avraham</i> holds that daylight is divided into 12 equal parts from dawn until the appearance of the stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> hold that daylight is determined from sunrise to sunset.<br>Therefore, the end of the third hour according to the <i>Magen Avraham</i> is earlier than that of the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Vilna Gaon</i>, and even though each \"hour\" is longer, it is calculated from dawn, which is at least 72 minutes before sunrise.

However, if the person recalls the possession of chametz after the beginning of the sixth hour, he must return to destroy his chametz even if he is involved in the performance of a mitzvah.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> goes further and explains that saving the people's lives supersedes all matters. Hence, even if a person has time to return home to destroy the chametz, he should first deal with saving the lives, for that is the primary concern.<br>Though the primacy of saving lives is accepted by all authorities, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> qualifies the matter. If the person knows for sure that he will be able to return home, destroy his chametz, and still have time to save the people's lives, he must destroy his chametz first.<br>", "Should he go out for his own purposes -- to deal with his own business affairs<br>", "and remember that he possesses chametz at home, he must return immediately -- to destroy it.

They did not require a person to return to destroy chametz unless a quantity the size of an egg, the measure associated with ritual purity and impurity, was found.<br>", "If there is less than the size of an egg, it is sufficient for him to nullify it in his heart -- as required by Torah law. The above applies when the person can still nullify his ownership over the chametz. However, beyond the beginning of the sixth hour, if the person has not nullified his chametz he must return to destroy even an amount the size of an olive.

Hence, a person is still entitled to nullify his ownership of it.<br>Once he has nullified his ownership of the dough, its presence in his house does not constitute a violation of the prohibitions against the possession of chametz, because it no longer belongs to him.<br>At present, people very infrequently bake matzah on Pesach itself in Ashkenazic communities. However, it is customary to do so in certain Sephardic communities. When preparing the dough, the women always nullify their ownership of any small pieces of dough that become stuck to the kneading pin or bowl before they become leavened, so that they will not possess even the slightest amount of chametz. (See <i>Hagahot Maimoni</i>.)<br>", "However, if [the dough] has already become leavened, his nullification is not at all effective -- just as one cannot nullify one's ownership of other chametz after the end of the sixth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan (Halachah 8).<br>", "for he has already violated [the prohibitions]: \"[leaven] shall not be seen\" and \"[leaven] shall not be found.\" He must destroy it immediately -- or cover it with a utensil if this occurs on the day of the festival itself.<br>", "when he returns home -- Furthermore, he must return home to do so as fast as possible.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.11": ["How must chametz be destroyed? -- Halachah 2:2 explains that the mitzvah \"to destroy chametz\" is fulfilled by nullifying one's ownership of it.

Once it is forbidden, it can be destroyed only by burning.<br>", "If the chametz is hard and the sea will not cause it to dissolve speedily, one should crumble it and then throw it into the sea. -- In his commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 2:1), the Rambam writes that dried bread should be crumbled \"a lot\" before being thrown to the sea. <i>Pesachim</i> 28a records a debate among the Sages whether it is necessary to crumble all chametz before throwing it to the sea. There is extensive debate among the commentators regarding the Rambam's interpretation of this passage. Most halachic authorities (<i>Taz, Orach Chayim</i> 445:1) require chametz to be crumbled even before it is tossed into the sea.<br>", "If other substances fell upon chametz and it was covered by three handbreadths or more of earth -- The Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 31b) states this law applies when \"a dog will no longer search for it.\" The Gemara explains that a dog will not search more than three handbreadths deep.<br>", "it is considered as having been destroyed.

The following chapter discusses this subject in depth.<br>", "If one burns it before the sixth hour, he is permitted to benefit from the charcoal that remains during Pesach -- <i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 21a explains that once chametz has been burned to the extent that it is not fit for a dog to eat, there is no prohibition involved in its use.<br>", "However, if he burns it from [the beginning of] the sixth hour and onward, since benefit may not be derived from it, it should not be used as fuel -- while it is being burned.<br>", "for an oven or range -- <i>Shabbat</i> 38b defines a range as an earthenware vessel in which coals can be placed, with two holes upon which to place two pots, and an oven as a larger structure.<br>", "One may not bake or cook with it -- even after it becomes charcoal.<br>", "If one did bake or cook [using the chametz as fuel], it is forbidden to derive benefit from that loaf or that dish. -- Nevertheless, this prohibition applies only if there is enough charcoal from the chametz to sustain a fire sufficient to cook or bake by itself (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>).<br>", "Similarly, it is forbidden to derive benefit from the charcoal that remains from it, because it was burned after benefit from it became forbidden. -- <i>Temurah</i> 34a states that we may benefit from the ashes of any substance that must be destroyed by burning.

(See Chapter 7, Halachah 1.)<br>The Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah is significant. Our Rabbis have offered two definitions of the mitzvah of resting on the Sabbath: In his commentary on <i>Yevamot</i> 6a, the Rashba states that the mitzvah is negative in nature: one refrains from performing prohibited labors. In contrast, in his commentary on Leviticus 23:24, the Ramban explains that the mitzvah possesses a positive dimension: to spend the day in a restful frame of mind, abstaining from all activities - even those that are not forbidden labors - which would disrupt this tranquility.<br>From the Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah, it would appear that he follows the first view.

With regard to all other transgressions punishable by \u05db\u05e8\u05ea, the Rambam merely states \"as a conscious act of defiance.\"<br>The Radbaz explains that it is possible that the Rambam mentioned the concept of \"willingly\" with regard to these three transgressions because they are the first cases of \u05db\u05e8\u05ea mentioned in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. After mentioning the concept on these three occasions, he does not think further repetition is necessary.<br>", "he is liable for karet - \u05db\u05e8\u05ea means \"cut off.\" <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 28a relates that a person liable for \u05db\u05e8\u05ea would die prematurely, before reaching the age of fifty.

Even \u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3 (after the fact), such parchment is not acceptable, as stated in Halachah 14.<br>As explained in Chapter 3, this requirement applies not only to the parchment, but also to all the other elements involved in making these sacred articles.<br>", "One may write on the hides of [all] kosher animals, wild beasts, and fowl. - See Halachah 20 in regard to writing on parchment made from the skin of birds.<br>", "This applies even when these animals died without being ritually slaughtered or when they were killed by wild beasts. - <i>Shabbat</i> (ibid.) offers the following parable to explain why even though such animals may not be eaten, it is permitted to use their hides. There were two people who were sentenced to death. One was executed by the king himself and the other by the executioner. Which is more noteworthy? Obviously, the one whom the king executed himself.<br>Similarly, in the present instance, the fact that these kosher animals were \"executed by the king\" - i.e., their death came about at God's decree - distinguishes them from other animals which are never fit to be eaten.<br>", "We may not write on the skin of a kosher fish because of the foul secretions, since the processing of the skin will not cause the foul secretions to cease. - <i>Hilchot Keilim</i> 1:4 states: \"The skin of a fish is not susceptible to contracting ritual impurity and would be fit for <i>tefillin</i> to be written upon, were it not for its foul secretions.\" This implies that the only problem is the secretions of the fish skin.<br>"], "Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.11": ["The g'vil for a Torah scroll and the k'laf for <i>tefillin</i> and for a Torah scroll must be processed with this purpose in mind. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:8; <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:1) states that when placing the skin in lime at the beginning of the process of making it into parchment, one should explicitly say that one is processing it for these purposes.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (32:11) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (32:26-27) explain that parchment processed to be used as a Torah scroll may be used for <i>tefillin</i> (or for a <i>mezuzah</i>).

It is not that we suspect that the gentile will not listen to the person who hires him, and his act is therefore not acceptable. Rather, because his nature is to \"follow his own intentions,\" he is disqualified from performing any act that requires a sacred intention.<br>According to this interpretation, the question of whether a gentile's actions are accepted if he is supervised by a Jew must be understood as follows: The act of preparing the parchment for a Torah scroll is not, in and of itself, a sacred act, but merely a preparation for performing such an act. Accordingly, one might assume that it is sufficient for a Jew to command the gentile to process the scroll for the proper intent. The gentile would be considered like a machine which performs activities with no will of its own, and it would be as if the Jew performed the act himself. In conclusion, however, it is accepted that because the gentile acts independently, the intention of the Jew who hires him cannot be associated with his acts.<br>", "Therefore - the scope of this ruling can be expanded:<br>", "whenever an article must be made with a specific intent in mind - e.g., the strands of tzitzit (<i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 1:11) or a bill of divorce (<i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 3:16)<br>", "it is unacceptable if made by a gentile. - Rabbenu Asher does not accept the Rambam's ruling with regard to these parchments.

Here, it is absolutely necessary to have the intent to use the parchment for <i>tefillin</i> or a Torah scroll only at the moment it is placed in the lime. We can assume that if a gentile is given instructions to place it in the lime with that intent, he will do so with that intent.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes both opinions in <i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:9. <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:1, however, mentions only the Rambam's opinion. In both places, the Ramah states that it is customary to follow Rabbenu Asher's opinion.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:12 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:28-29 quote Rabbenu Asher's statements that a Jew should be present at the time the parchment is placed in the lime and that he should explicitly tell the gentile to put it in the lime to be used for a Torah scroll. Afterwards, he should assist the gentile somewhat in the process of preparing the parchment.<br>", "[The parchment used for] a <i>mezuzah</i> need not be processed with this purpose in mind. - The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 3:6) states, \"Parchment which was processed for use as a talisman is acceptable for a <i>mezuzah</i>.\"<br>In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the reason for the difference in law between a <i>mezuzah</i>, on the one hand, and a Torah scroll and <i>tefillin</i>, on the other, stems from the fact that a Torah scroll and <i>tefillin</i> are mitzvot which each person is obligated to fulfill. In contrast, the mitzvah of <i>mezuzah</i> is an obligation that is not incumbent on a person unless he dwells in a house that requires one. (It must be noted, however, that there are opinions which maintain that this responsum was not written by the Rambam.)<br>This ruling is not accepted by the other authorities.

If, however, one wrote <i>tefillin</i> without ruling the parchment, the <i>tefillin</i> are acceptable even if the lines are crooked (<i>Mishneh Berurah</i> 32:21).<br>", "because they are covered. - This explains why although a verse from the Torah must always be written on ruled parchment, we are not required to do so for <i>tefillin</i>.<br>Even though a <i>mezuzah</i> is also covered, ruling the parchment is required because it can be removed from its covering easily and must be checked twice in seven years.

In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam defines an <i>apikoros</i> as a person who denies the Torah and/or the prophetic tradition, while in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:7, he describes a <i>min</i> as a person who does not believe in God. When a <i>min</i> writes a Torah scroll, the names of God it contains do not possess any holiness, because he does not believe in God at all. In contrast, since an <i>apikoros</i> does believe in God, were he to write a Torah scroll the names he writes would possess a certain dimension of holiness.<br>", "should be burned. - In <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 6:8, the Rambam explains why burning such a scroll does not violate the prohibition against destroying God's name:<br>He does not believe in the sanctity of [God's] name and did not compose it for a sacred purpose. Rather, he considers this to be similar to any other text. Since this is his intent, the names [of God he writes] do not become holy.<br>Significantly, the Rambam does not state that we presume that the scribe had the intention that the name of God refer to a false deity. Note, however, the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 2:5: \"[It can be assumed that] a <i>min's</i> thoughts are concerned with false gods.\" <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 39:4 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 39:13 refer to the latter statement and explain that the passages should be burned, because the names of God refer to a false deity.<br><i>Shabbat</i> 116a draws a parallel between the burning of such a Torah scroll and the scroll of a <i>sotah</i> (a woman accused of adultery). In the process of a <i>sotah's</i> trial, a scroll on which is written a passage containing God's name is blotted out. Our Sages conclude that just as God is willing to allow His name to be wiped out to establish peace between a man and his wife, so, too, He allows His name to be destroyed because of these individuals who disturb the peace that exists between Him and His people.<br>", "If they were written by a gentile, an apostate Jew, a person who betrays [the Jews] - or Jewish property<br>", "to a powerful person - It was quite common in the Second Temple period for Jews to betray their countrymen or their property to the Roman authorities.

It has been confused and has sunk into oblivion. - I.e., contemporary Greek is very different from the classical tongue, to the extent that they can be considered to be two separate languages.<br>", "Therefore, at present, all three sacred articles may be written using Assyrian script alone. - Significantly, however, in <i>Hilchot Megillah</i> 2:3, the Rambam does not state that Greek is unacceptable at present. Note also <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 690).<br>", "One must be precise while writing them, making sure that one letter does not become attached to another one, because any letter which is not surrounded by parchment - In our commentary on the following halachah, we discuss the laws governing a letter which is not surrounded by parchment because of a hole that is located on its border.<br>", "on all four sides - There is no minimum amount of space required to be left between letters. Furthermore, one must be careful not to leave too much space, to the extent that it appears that the word is divided in two (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 274:4).<br>", "is unacceptable. - If the letters are attached, however, the difficulty may be corrected and, afterwards, the sacred article may be used (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:18).<br>", "Any letter that cannot be read by a child who is neither wise nor foolish - This refers to a child who is able to recognize letters, but not words. Were he able to recognize words, one could assume that he might identify a letter, not by its shape, but because of the meaning of the word in which it is located (Rashi, <i>Menachot</i> 29b).<br>", "is not acceptable. - Tefillin and mezuzot must be written in order (Chapter 3, Halachah 5; Chapter 5, Halachah 1). Therefore, if a letter which cannot be recognized by a child is written in <i>tefillin</i> or mezuzot, the parchment may never be corrected. Changing the form of the letter is tantamount to rewriting it in its entirety (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:25).<br>", "Therefore, one must be careful with regard to the form of the letters - This applies not only when the sacred article was originally written, but throughout the time it is being used. If a portion of a letter cracks, fades, is rubbed out, or is torn, in a manner which alters its form, the sacred article is unacceptable.<br>See also the <i>Tur</i>, <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, and commentaries (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 36) for a detailed description of the proper form for each letter.<br>", "so that a yud will not resemble a vav, nor a vav a yud; - These two letters are very similar, the difference between them being that the leg of the <i>vav</i> is extended and that of the <i>yud</i> is not. Therefore, if a scribe would write a <i>yud</i> with a long leg or a <i>vav</i> with a short leg, difficulties may arise.<br>", "a kaf should not resemble a beit, nor a beit a kaf; - The difference between these two letters is primarily in the lower right-hand corner.

Writing which is \"perfect\" should not be broken by holes in the parchment.<br>", "If, however, ink passes over the hole [without seeping through] - As long as no ink seeps through the parchment, the writing can be considered as \"perfect.\"<br>", "the presence of the hole is of no consequence, and one may write upon it. - This applies even if there is a slight hole in the parchment which can be seen when the parchment is held up to light (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:17; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:32).<br>[The latter principle has ramifications in contemporary society. Today, many scribes check mezuzot and <i>tefillin</i> using light tables and/or magnifying glasses.

This halachah mentions the ruling when the perforation is made afterwards.<br>", "it has been written on: - Since, at the outset, the writing was \"perfect,\" the parchment is not disqualified because of a hole of later origin. Nevertheless, as will be explained, there are other halachic difficulties involved.<br>", "If the perforation is within the inside of a letter - e.g., in the space inside a heh, inside a mem, or inside any of the other letters - it is acceptable. - According to the Rambam, the letter is acceptable even though the hole touches the letter itself. Although the previous halachah states that a letter must be surrounded by parchment on all sides, that statement refers only to the external perimeter of the letter. There is no obligation that the letter be surrounded by parchment on the inside.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:15, quotes the Rambam's opinion, but also mentions a passage from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 1:9), which requires that the letter be surrounded by parchment on the inside as well. Most Ashkenazic halachic authorities suggest accepting the stringency of the Jerusalem Talmud's ruling.<br>", "Despite the fact that a leg of a letter becomes perforated to the extent that it becomes separated [into two portions], it is acceptable if: a) [the length of - the portion of<br>", "the leg] - which remains connected to the body of the letter<br>", "is equivalent to that of a small letter; - i.e., a <i>yud</i>.<br>In this context, Rabbenu Asher differentiates between the right and left legs of the <i>heh</i>.

If the length of the upper portion would prevent a child (see the previous halachah) from confusing it with a <i>yud</i>, it is acceptable.<br>", "If [the length of - the portion of<br>", "the leg] - which remains<br><b>is not equivalent to that of a small letter, it is -</b> not large enough to be of consequence, and the letter is<br><b>not acceptable. -</b> See also <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32).<br>"], "Torah Study 5.1": ["Just as a person is commanded to honor his father and hold him in awe - Exodus 20:12 commands: \"Honor your father and mother.\" Leviticus 19:3 commands: \"A man shall fear his mother and father.\" (See <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i>, Chapter 6, for a discussion of these mitzvot.)<br>", "so, too, is he obligated to honor his teacher and hold him in awe. - All the particulars of this halachah apply only regarding <i>rabo hamuzhak,</i> a teacher from whom one has learned the majority of one's wisdom (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 33a.) (See also the commentary on the next halachah.) However, every teacher under whom one has studied Torah deserves a certain measure of respect (Halachah 9).<br>", "[Indeed, the measure of honor and awe] due one's teacher exceeds that due one's father. His father brings him into the life of this world - i.e., he sired him and provided him with his fundamental necessities<br>", "while his teacher, who teaches him wisdom, brings him into the life of the world to come. - A person's Torah study and the mitzvot it motivates are the means through which he will attain a portion of the world to come.<br>The reason given by the Rambam has its source in <i>Bava Metzia</i>, <i>ibid.</i> <i>Keritot</i> 28a states a different reason: \"He and his father are both obligated to honor his teacher.\" The Rambam quotes this in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Mitzvah 209).<br>", "[Accordingly,] if he saw a lost object belonging to his father and one belonging to his teacher, the lost object belonging to his teacher takes precedence. - Therefore, he should tend to his teacher's article first. Only after returning it should he tend to his father's.<br>", "If his father and his teacher are both carrying loads, he should relieve his teacher's load, and then his father's. - In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Keritot</i> 6:9, the Rambam equates removing a load with returning a lost article and redeeming a person from captivity in all respects. Accordingly, as explained below, if one's father is also a Torah sage, he should be given priority. However, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that where there is no danger to life or property, and only honor is involved, priority should be given to one's teacher, even if one's father is a Torah sage of equivalent stature.<br>", "If his father and his teacher are held as captives, he should redeem his teacher, and afterwards, redeem his father. - Note <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i>, 8:10-18, for a discussion of this important mitzvah.<br>", "However, if his father is also a Torah sage - even if he is not equivalent to his teacher (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)<br>", "he should redeem his father first. - This decision is disputed with regard to the return of a lost object, as explained below. Nevertheless, with regard to the redemption of captives, all agree that because of the life-and-death nature of the question, one's father is given priority if he has achieved some level of scholarship.<br>", "[Similarly,] if his father is a Torah sage - even if he is not equivalent to his teacher - he should return his lost article, and then that belonging to his teacher. - The commentaries have noted the apparent contradiction between this statement and <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> 12:2, which states:<br>[The following rule applies when] one sees a lost object belonging to his teacher and a lost object belonging to his father: If his father was equal in stature to his teacher, his father's [lost article] is given precedence. If not, his teacher's is given precedence.This applies only to a person's primary teacher, from whom he learned the majority of his wisdom.<br>The text of <i>Bava Metzia</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the source for this decision, is closer to the text in <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i>. Indeed, on that basis, the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> and others maintain that our text contains a printing error. However, that conclusion is difficult to accept, since in his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Keritot</i> <i>ibid.</i>, the Rambam gives a father who is a Torah sage priority over a person's teacher, without requiring that the father be of greater stature.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that our text refers to a situation when it is possible to retrieve both lost objects, and the only question is whose is given priority. In contrast, <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> refers to a situation where it is possible to return only one of the lost objects.<br>Alternatively, the Tashbaytz (Responsa, Vol. III, 275) and the Radbaz (Responsa, Vol. V, 1493) explain that here we are referring to a father who has also instructed his son (albeit, not to the same degree as his teacher). In contrast, <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> refers to a father who has not instructed his son at all.<br>", "There is no greater honor than that due a teacher, and no greater awe than that due a teacher. Our Sages declared - <i>Avot</i> 4:15<br>", "\"Your fear of your teacher should be equivalent to your fear of Heaven.\" - In his commentary on that Mishnah, Rashi notes that <i>Pesachim</i> 22b equates the deference due a Torah sage to that due God. Surely, that applies to a sage under whom one has studied.<br>", "Therefore, they said - <i>Sanhedrin</i> 110a. The Rambam quotes the entire passage that follows below in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, Positive Mitzvah 209, in his description of the commandment to honor a Torah sage.<br>", "Whoever disputes the authority of his teacher - i.e., \"comes out against his decisions...teaching and granting decisions, without his permission\" (<i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>). (See the following halachot.)<br>", "is considered as if he revolts against the Divine Presence, as implied [by Numbers 26:9]: \"...who led a revolt against God.\" - This verse describes Korach's revolt. Though ostensibly, the revolt was directed against Moses, the Torah considers it as directed against God, Himself.<br>", "Whoever engages in controversy with his teacher is considered as if he engaged in controversy with the Divine Presence, as implied [by Numbers 20:13]: \"...where the Jews contested with God and where He was sanctified.\" - Numbers 20:1-3 describes how, because of a lack of water, the Jews began quarreling with Moses. As above, God interpreted their controversy as being directed against God Himself.<br><b>Whoever complains against his teacher is considered as if he complains against the Divine Presence, as implied [by Exodus 16:8]: \"Your complaints are not against us, but against God.\" -</b> When the Jews complained against him and Aaron because of a lack of food, Moses gave them this reply.

To one's outstanding teacher (<i>rabo hamuzhak</i> ), from whom one has gained the majority of one's wisdom. However, a person who has not gained the majority of his wisdom under a teacher's instruction is considered to be both a student and colleague. He is not obligated to honor him in all the above matters.<br>", "A person who - studied under a teacher and then<br>", "establishes a house of study [where] he sits, explains, and teaches - and renders halachic decisions. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 242:7 (see also <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>) explains that the prohibition applies only to rendering halachic decisions on matters directly related to practice. There is no difficulty involved in teaching on a merely theoretical level. However, it is not clear whether the Rambam would accept this view.<br>The <i>Rishon Letzion</i> explains that this prohibition applies even to establishing a house of study under one's own direction, even though one does not render any halachic decisions.<br>", "without his teacher's permission - A person granted permission by his teacher is allowed to render halachic decisions outside his teacher's presence. The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 242:14) equates a teacher's granting permission to a student to render halachic decisions to the concept of <i>semichah</i> within its present context (in contrast to its definition in Talmudic times).<br>", "in his teacher's lifetime. - It is a mark of disrespect to one's teacher to set oneself up to be an equivalent authority.<br><i>Eruvin</i> 62b relates that as long as Rav Huna was alive, Rav Chisda, his disciple, would not render any decisions, even those concerning as obvious a matter as dipping \"an egg in a mixture of sour milk and bread.\"<br>After the teacher's death, there is no restriction, provided one is fit to render Torah judgments. (See Halachot 3 and 4.)<br>", "[This applies] even when one's teacher is in another country. - This can be derived from <i>Eruvin</i> 63a, which states that Rav Hamnuna would not render judgments in Rav Huna's lifetime, even though they lived in different cities.<br>Even though a person has been granted permission by his teacher to render halachic judgments...<br>", "It is forbidden to ever render a halachic judgment - except in the instances mentioned in the following halachah. The Vilna Gaon explains that this includes even teaching a halachic concept incidentally, outside the context of a house of study.<br>", "in one's teacher's presence. - The Rambam defines this term in the next halachah.<br><i>Ketubot</i> 60b relates that, without considering the question of respect due one's teacher, there is an additional problem. Spiritual influences will cause a student who renders a halachic judgment in his teacher's presence to err.<br>The Maharik (Responsum 169) states that if a student has reached a stature approximate to that of his teacher, he is permitted to render halachic judgments even in his teacher's presence. He points to many Talmudic passages which record halachic decisions given by Resh Lakish in the presence of Rabbi Yochanan (his teacher).<br><i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 242:12) explains that it is possible to say that the Rambam would accept this decision. However, there is no intimation of such a concept in the Rambam's words.<br>", "Whoever renders a halachic judgment in his teacher's presence is worthy of death. - <i>Eruvin</i> 63a explains that Nadav and Avihu, Aharon's sons, died (Leviticus, Chapter 10) because of this sin.

There, all halachic questions were posed to Moses, as alluded to by Exodus 33:7: \"All those who sought God would go the Tent of Meeting\" (Rashi, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 5b). (See also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 20:9.)<br>[Exodus, Chapter 18, relates how Moses appointed judges to render halachic judgments concerning cases that did not require Moses' knowledge.

In summation of that entire passage, Rabbenu Nissim writes that a Torah sage is not entitled to render a halachic judgment until he reaches 40, unless there is no sage of equivalent status in his city. He questions why the Rambam makes no mention of this requirement.<br>Among the resolutions offered for the Rambam's decision are:a) The Rambam interprets the passage from <i>Avodah Zarah</i> to mean that only until he is forty years old can a worthy student hold himself back from rendering judgment because of his humility. He does not mention this law here, since the unworthy students have become so numerous, and at present, no worthy student should hesitate from rendering judgment at all (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).b) The Talmud's decision refers only to a student who received his instruction from an individual teacher. At present, since students gain their knowledge from texts which are always available, there is no such restriction (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).c) The Rambam places the entire emphasis on a student's capability and does not pay attention to the age factor (<i>Merchevat Hamishneh</i>).<br>Though the latter paragraph is included in this halachah in the published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, many manuscripts include it in the following halachah.<br>"], "Torah Study 5.4": ["Any student who is not worthy of rendering halachic judgments and does so is foolish, wicked, and arrogant. - The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Avot</i> 4:9, which uses these adjectives to describe a person who \"renders halachic judgments casually.\" In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam states that this applies to one who \"does not worry about rendering a judgment and proceeds to do so without fear or proper consideration.\"<br>", "[Proverbs 7:26:] \"She has cast down many corpses\" applies to him. - This concept can be derived because the word <i>hipilah</i> (cast down) is related to <i>neifal,</i> a stillborn baby (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>", "[Conversely,] a sage who is worthy of rendering halachic judgments - Almost parenthetically, in the midst of his critique of the underdeveloped who render halachic judgments too casually, the Rambam explains that, nevertheless, a person who is qualified should not hesitate from rendering halachic judgments. On the contrary, if he does hesitate, he is also guilty of improper conduct.<br>[A teacher once told a student to serve as the Rabbi of a particular community.

Rabbi Eliezer would say: \"I praise the lazy ones who do not leave their homes during the festivals, because it is written: 'And you shall rejoice on your festivals.\u2019\u201cThat is unacceptable, because Rabbi Yitzchak taught: What is the source for the obligation that a person has to visit his teacher on the festival, it is written: \"Why are you going to him today?

Therefore, he explains that it applies only in the time of the Temple. In contrast, at present, since the Temple is destroyed and the festival pilgrimages are no longer made, it is improper to make a special visit to one's teacher. Doing so would imply that one is showing him greater deference than is shown the Divine Presence.<br>This view is not accepted by many commentators. Indeed, the Talmudic references to visiting one's teacher during the festival cited above took place in the period after the destruction of the Temple. Based on the statement quoted in Halachah 1, \"Your fear for your teacher should be equivalent to your fear of Heaven,\" <i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> explains that there is a parallel between a visit to one's teacher and a pilgrimage to the Temple.<br>"], "Torah Study 5.8": ["unless it is customary for his teacher also to show him deference. - Since the teacher himself shows the student deference, he will not be upset by others doing so (Rashi, <i>Bava Batra</i> 119b).<br>All the services which a servant performs for his master should be performed by a student for his teacher. - as an expression of the deference and respect he has for him.<br>", "[However,] - In one situation, an exception is made to the above principle...<br>", "if [the student] was in a place where he was not recognized and was not wearing <i>tefillin</i> - At that time, it was customary to wear <i>tefillin</i> the entire day.

However, in this instance, there is a particular obligation to do so, lest it be assumed that this teaching was authored by one's teacher.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 2:1) mentions the following incident: Rabbi Yochanan was walking, supported by Rabbi Ya'akov bar Iddi. Rabbi Yochanan complained to him that his student, Rabbi Eliezer, never made statements in his name.<br>Rabbi Ya'akov told him that there was a precedent to such behavior. Rabbi Meir would quote teachings in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, but would not quote teachings in the name of Rabbi Akiva, his teacher.Rabbi Yochanan answered that there was nothing wrong with that, because everyone knew that Rabbi Meir was Rabbi Akiva's disciple, and most of his teachings came from him.<br>Rabbi Ya'akov explained that the same concept applied at present: \"Everyone knows that Rabbi Eliezer is your disciple, and that most of his teachings are yours.\"<br>Thus, were a student to mention a concept without mentioning its source, it is likely for the listeners to assume that it was authored by his teacher. If, in fact, it was authored by someone other than his teacher, and his teacher would not have approved of it, creating such an impression would not be respectful to his teacher.<br>", "When his teacher dies, he should rend all his garments until he reveals his heart. - With regard to the rending of one's garments until one's heart is revealed, see <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 8:3, 9:2 and <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 22a.<br>", "He should never mend them. - <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 26a equates garments torn over a teacher's passing with those torn over a father's passing, with regard to the latter law.

If olive oil is not available, one should use beeswax candles.<br>", "and even those wicks that do not hold the light well. - Here also, these wicks were forbidden for use for the Sabbath candles lest one tilt the light.<br>Although all wicks are acceptable, it is customary to use wicks of flax or of cotton (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:2).<br>", "Even on the Sabbath nights of Chanukah, it is permitted to light - the Chanukah lights<br>", "with oils and wicks that are forbidden to be used for the Sabbath lights. - Needless to say, the prohibition against using these candles for the Sabbath lights still remains in effect.<br>", "[The reason for this leniency is that] - In addition to the reason cited by the Rambam in this halachah, <i>Shabbat</i> 21b mentions the principle stated in the previous halachah: If a Chanukah candle is extinguished, there is no obligation to light it again.<br>Thus, the reason these wicks and oils may be used on the Sabbath of Chanukah can be explained as follows: We are not worried about the candles being extinguished, because even in that eventuality, there is no obligation to relight the candles. Nor are we worried that one will tilt the Chanukah candles so that their light will shine brighter, because:<br>", "it is forbidden to use the Chanukah candles [for one's own purposes] - During the week, this prohibition applies only during the first half hour that the candles are burning. Afterwards, their mitzvah is completed, as stated in the previous halachah.<br>", "whether on the Sabbath or on a weekday. - The Sabbath candles were instituted to bring about <i>sh'lom bayit</i>, \"peace in the home,\" through the use of their light. In contrast, the Chanukah candles were instituted for <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle. To emphasize this purpose, the Sages forbade using them for any other purpose.<br>Furthermore, the Chanukah candles were instituted to commemorate the miracle of the Menorah in the Temple. Thus, just as it is forbidden to use the Menorah's light for any worldly purpose, so too, the light of the Chanukah candles is prohibited (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:8).<br>", "It is even forbidden to use their light to inspect or count coins. - <i>Shabbat</i> 22a relates that this prohibition was instituted so that the mitzvot would be viewed with respect. If a person were able to use the light of the Chanukah lamp for his own purposes, he would treat the mitzvah with little regard.<br>In this halachah, the Rambam is describing a situation when the Chanukah candles are lit outside the home (where it is unlikely that the light of the candles will be used for mundane purposes). In Halachah 8, he mentions the lighting of candles within the home (and it is likely that work will be carried out within the home at that time). Therefore, it is in that halachah that he mentions the custom of lighting another candle (the <i>shamash</i>) next to the Chanukah candles, so that if a person carries out an activity near the candles, he will be using the light of that additional candle.<br>See also the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which questions whether it is permissible to use the Chanukah candles for a holy purpose - e.g., to study Torah by their light.<br>"], "Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.7": ["It is a mitzvah to place - As is obvious from Halachah 9, the Chanukah lamp should be placed outside before being lit.<br>\"IR1200", "the Chanukah lamp at the outside of the entrance to one's home - As mentioned previously, the mitzvah of lighting Chanukah candles was instituted for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle. Therefore, the candles should be placed at the outside of one's dwelling to attract the attention of the passersby in the public domain (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 21b).<br>In a spiritual sense, this points to the potential possessed by the Chanukah candles to spread light beyond the normal limits of holiness. Generally, mitzvot are performed within a home or synagogue. In this instance, the nature of the mitzvah is to spread light to the public domain, to illuminate the darkness of the world at large.<br>\"IX", "within the handbreadth that is closest to the doorway - If the candelabrum were placed any further away, it would not be obvious that the owner of the home placed it there for the purpose of kindling Chanukah lights (<i>ibid.</i>).<br>", "on the left side as one enters the home - Generally, mitzvot are associated with the right side; the left side, by contrast, is identified with the forces of evil.

Needless to say, there have been countless other periods of persecution in Jewish history.<br>It is, however, significant that even in times when there was no obvious danger, the custom has been to light the Chanukah candles inside our homes. Even in the present day, when there is little danger of persecution in most places where Jews are located, it is not customary to light the Chanukah candles at the entrance to the home in most communities.<br>", "even if he lit it on his table, it is sufficient. - i.e., there is no necessity to light near a doorway.

Since it is very likely that there will be some activity carried out in the house while the candles are burning, an additional light should be kindled. Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:14, which explains that the present custom is to kindle an additional light near the Chanukah candles, besides the light that is ordinarily burning in the room.<br>This light, called the <i>shamash</i>, should be placed apart from the Chanukah candles so that it can be distinguished from them (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 673:1).

This opinion is not, however, accepted by other authorities, although they do mention that a child should be trained in the observance of the mitzvah of Chanukah candles as part of his process of education (<i>chinuch</i>).<br>Although the Rambam does not mention the latter concept explicitly, nevertheless, it is expected that he would agree.

This law differs from the others stated in this halachah, which depend on the principle, \"Kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah and not placing it down.\" Indeed, <i>Shabbat</i> 22b cites this law in an attempt to refute this principle. Nevertheless, although the above-mentioned principle is accepted, this law is still valid. Thus, it can be assumed that the Rambam mentions this law in this halachah only because it is mentioned in this context in the Talmud.<br>", "since - another factor is involved<br>", "an observer will say, \"He is standing there for his own purposes.\"<br>", "When a lamp was burning through the entire [Sabbath] day, one may extinguish the light - To fulfill the mitzvah for the present night, one must extinguish the light. The word \"may\" is used only because there is no obligation to kindle one's Chanukah lights in this manner.<br>", "recite the blessings [for the mitzvah], and relight the lamp. - Although an onlooker would not necessarily appreciate that this lamp was kindled for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, one is considered to have fulfilled the mitzvah. The rationale for this decision - and most of the other laws mentioned in this halachah - is the following principle:<br>", "Kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah and not placing it down. - <i>Shabbat</i> 23a derives this principle from the blessing we recite before lighting the candles, which mentions the commandment \"to kindle the Chanukah lights.\"<br>There are two dimensions to every mitzvah: the performance of the deed itself (the <i>po'al</i>) - in this instance, the deed of kindling the Chanukah lights - and the effect of that performance (the <i>nif'al</i>), the fact that these lights are burning. This principle emphasizes that it is the kindling of the lights which is the focus of the mitzvah.<br>This is significant, for one might think that since the purpose of the mitzvah is <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, communicating the Chanukah miracles, what is most important is the fact that the lights are burning; how they are lit is of no consequence. This principle shows, however, that for <i>pirsumei nisa</i> to take place, the Chanukah lights must be kindled as prescribed by our Sages (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).<br>", "It is permissible to light one Chanukah candle - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 674:2) cites an opinion that states that this also applies to other candles that are lit for the purpose of a mitzvah - e.g., the Sabbath candles.<br>", "from another Chanukah candle. - Chanukah candles may not be used for any mundane purpose, for doing so is an act of disrespect for the mitzvah. <i>Shabbat</i> 22a states that using them to light another Chanukah candle is acceptable, however, since this is obviously not an act of disrespect.<br>The Rambam states this law in the present halachah, which deals with the principle, \"Kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah and not placing it down,\" because <i>Shabbat</i> 22b associates the two. Since \"kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah,\" the act of lighting the lamp is the essence of the mitzvah, and, therefore, using another Chanukah candle is not considered an act of disrespect. If, however, placing the Chanukah candles down constituted the mitzvah, the kindling of another candle would not be a direct fulfillment of a mitzvah. Therefore, it would not be proper to use another Chanukah lamp for that purpose (see Rashi, <i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>).<br>[Note, however, <i>Tosafot (Shabbat</i> 23a) and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 674:1), which state that it is customary not to light one Chanukah candles from another.]<br>Among the questions also discussed with regard to this law is whether one must light the second candle from the first, or if it is acceptable if one lights a match from the first candle and uses it to light the second candle. To state the matter in terms of a question relevant to us: If the <i>shamash</i> is extinguished and one intends to use it to light other candles, may it be relit from a Chanukah candle which is already burning or not? Both opinions are mentioned in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 674:1). According to the later authorities, it is definitely desirable to light only a candle to be used for a mitzvah itself from the Chanukah lights.<br>"], "Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.10": ["When a courtyard has two entrances from two different directions - Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 23a, clarifies that the entrances need not be on opposite sides, as long as they are different - e.g, north and east<br>", "it requires two [Chanukah] lamps. - The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 671:8 states that only one blessing should be recited, for the second candle is not being lit to fulfill the mitzvah <i>per se</i>.<br>", "[Were one to light at only one entrance,] the passersby from the other direction might say, \"A Chanukah light had not been placed down.\" - At present, however, when it is customary to light inside one's home, it is sufficient even for a person with such a courtyard to kindle a single Chanukah lamp (Ramah, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>", "If, however, [two entrances to a courtyard] - and it is obvious they are from a single home (Ramah, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>", "are located on the same side, [it is sufficient] to light at only one of them. - For there is no possibility of such a mistake being made.<br>"], "Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.11": ["A guest - i.e., a person who is not a permanent member of the household, even though he eats at the family table (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 677:4).<br><i>Shabbat</i> 23a, the source for this halachah, concerns itself with <i>yeshivah</i> students.

I.e., although as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 4, the obligation to kindle Chanukah lamps is incumbent on each person, the mitzvah is that every Jewish dwelling should be illuminated. Therefore, if Chanukah lamps are being kindled in one's dwelling, one has no further obligation regarding the mitzvah even though one does not see those Chanukah lamps oneself.<br>The rationale for this decision is that the Chanukah candles were instituted for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>. Thus, what is important is that the light of the Chanukah lamps is perceived by others.<br>Note the Ramah's decision (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 677:3) that if a person desires, he may light the Chanukah lamps in the place where he is staying. This is common practice in the Ashkenazic community at present.<br>The Ramah states that such a person may also recite the blessings.

Although <i>Shabbat</i> 23b, the source for this halachah, refers to the two items mentioned in this halachah together, there is no necessity for the Rambam to do so. On the contrary, the Rambam structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> subject by subject. Seemingly, it would have been proper for him to mention this law in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>. [Indeed, the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 263:3) mention this law in connection with the laws of the Sabbath as well.]<br>By structuring his text in this manner, however, the Rambam indicates that the priority of kindling Sabbath candles stems not from a particular law associated with the Sabbath, but rather from a general principle - the importance of peace - which relates to the entire Torah as a whole (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XV).<br>", "the lamp for one's home receives priority, since it generates peace within the home. - <i>Shabbat</i> 23b associates the Sabbath candles with peace, explaining that they prevent the members of the household from stumbling over obstacles, and also allow them to avoid the discomfort of sitting in darkness.<br>Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:1, the Rambam mentions that the Sabbath candles contribute to the atmosphere of <i>oneg Shabbat</i>, Sabbath pleasure. Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:5, he mentions them as being associated with activities carried out in honor of the Sabbath (<i>k'vod Shabbat</i>). In the laws of the Sabbath itself, the Rambam does not mention the connection between the Sabbath candles and peace within the home.<br>This relates to the concept mentioned previously, that the peace generated by the Sabbath candles relates to the Torah as a whole and not to the Sabbath in particular (<i>Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.</i>).<br>", "[Peace is of primary importance, as reflected by the mitzvah requiring] God's name to be blotted out - As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 6, blotting out God's name is a severe matter and constitutes a Torah prohibition.

The Torah does not exist for the world. On the contrary, <i>Shabbat</i> 88b relates that the Torah existed even before the world came into being. I.e., the Torah represents spiritual truths that transcend our material existence. Nevertheless, the Torah \"was given,\" drawn down into the context of our material frame of reference for a purpose,<br>", "to bring about peace within the world, as [Proverbs 3:17] states: \"Its ways are pleasant ways and all its paths are peace.\" - This concept shares an intrinsic connection to Chanukah (and is therefore chosen as the conclusion for <i>Hilchot Chanukah</i>), because the Chanukah candles are intended for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>. They project the light of Torah into the world at large and make the world conscious of its Godly purpose. The spreading of the awareness of Godliness is associated with peace, as reflected by the Rambam's statements at the conclusion of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:In that era (the Era of the Redemption), there will be... neither envy nor competition....

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also rules that if one is unable to go to the synagogue he should, at least, attempt to pray at the same time as the community. He quotes both these concepts in his <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 90:9.<br>Though this and the following two halachot mention the importance of a synagogue, the synagogue is discussed here only within the context of the importance of communal prayer. In Chapter 11, the Rambam focuses on the sanctity of the synagogue as a subject in its own right.<br>", "Anyone who has a synagogue in his city and does not pray [together] with the congregation in it is called a bad neighbor. - <i>Berachot</i> 8a derives this concept based on Jeremiah 12:14: \"So says God regarding all my evil neighbors that touch the inheritance (i.e., the synagogues and houses of study) that I have bequeathed to My people Israel.\"<br>When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:11) also quotes the continuation of the above Talmudic passage:<br>Furthermore, they cause dispersion to themselves and their children as [the verse in Jeremiah continues]: \"Behold, I will uproot them from their land.\"<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.2": ["It is a mitzvah to run to the synagogue as [Hoshea 6:3] states: \"Let us know.

Instead, he should proceed [slowly,] step by step. - Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 6b) explains that hurrying away from the synagogue, suggests that one views the synagogue and the obligations contained therein to be a burden.<br>", "When one enters a synagogue he should go in the distance of two doorways and then pray, - Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 8a) explains that we are obligated to enter the distance of two doorways widthwise in order not to appear anxious to leave. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) explains that this refers to a distance of eight handbreadths.<br>The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> interprets the Talmud's statement, \"the measure of two doorways\" as a matter of time, not distance. One should wait a few moments after entering the synagogue before he starts to pray.<br>The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> also states that according to the interpretation that the \"measure of two doorways\" refers to actual distance, this requirement only applies when the synagogue is located near the public thoroughfare. If it is not, one may pray near the door. Rabbenu Yonah also mentions that a person whose fixed place for prayer in the synagogue is beside the door does not violate this requirement. It is obvious that he is sitting there not because of his desire to leave quickly, but because it is his seat in the synagogue.<br>", "[in order] to fulfill [the instructions of Proverbs 8:34] which states: \"to guard the posts of My doors.\" - The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:1) points to the plural forms of \"posts\" and \"doors\" as indicating the need to enter the distance of two doorways.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.3": ["A study hall is greater - i.e., it is a more auspicious place to pray.<br>", "than a synagogue - Other ramifications of this concept are mentioned in Chapter 11, Halachah 14, and in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 4:9.<br>", "Even though [some of the] great Sages [lived in] cities where many synagogues were located, they would pray only in the place where they studied Torah. - <i>Berachot</i> 30b relates: \"Even though there were thirteen synagogues in Tiberias, Rav Ami and Rav Assi would pray only between the pillars in the study hall.\"<br><i>Berachot</i> 8a interprets the phrase \"the gates of Zion\" in Psalms 87:2: \"God loves the gates of Zion above all the dwellings of Jacob\" as referring to \"the gates of those who are \u05d1\u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (distinguished by the halachah studied there)\" and states that they receive the highest degree of Divine attention.<br>The Talmud continues: Abbaye says: \"Originally, I would study in my house and pray in the synagogue. After hearing this, I pray only where I study.\"<br>", "The above applies [however, only] when one can participate in communal prayer there. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions the view of certain rabbinic authorities who maintain that it is preferable for a scholar to pray in a study hall even without a <i>minyan</i>. However, he also mentions the opinion of Rabbenu Asher (See Responsum 4) who writes that if the scholars do not appear in the synagogue the common people will assume that their presence is also unnecessary. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:18) quotes the Rambam's position.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.4": ["What is implied by [the term,] communal prayer? One [person] prays aloud and all [the others] listen. - With this statement, the Rambam touches on a point debated both by the Sages of the Talmud and the later Rabbis. The mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 33b, states:<br>Just as the leader of the congregation is obligated [to pray], each individual is obligated. Rabban Gamliel states: \"The leader of the congregation fulfills the obligation on behalf of the community.\"<br>The Talmud (34b) elaborates on the difference of opinion:<br>They asked Rabban Gamliel: \"According to your opinion, why does the community pray?\"He replied: \"In order to allow the leader of the community to prepare his prayers.\"Rabban Gamliel asked them: \"According to your opinion, why does the leader of the congregation pray aloud?\"They replied: \"In order to allow those who are not knowledgeable to fulfill their obligation.\"He told them: \"Just as he fulfills the obligation on behalf of those who are not knowledgeable, he fulfills it on behalf of those who are knowledgeable.\"<br>The Sages of the Talmud continued to debate the issue. The ultimate decision accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, the Rambam (See Halachah 9), and Rabbenu Asher, is that during the entire year, the Sages' opinion is accepted. However, on Rosh HaShanah, because of the complexity of the blessings (See Halachah 10), Rabban Gamliel's opinion prevails.<br>Both Rabban Gamliel and the Sages agree that the practice of communal prayer involves two elements:a) the silent prayers of many individuals; andb) the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.They differ, however, as to which of these elements is considered of primary importance. According to the Sages, the essential element of communal prayer is that ten or more people recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the same time. According to Rabban Gamliel, the essential element of communal prayer is, as the Rambam states in this halachah, the prayer of the leader of the congregation.<br>[Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, which explains that their difference of opinion revolves around a more general issue: Which is of higher priority, quantity (the prayers of the many) or quality (the prayers of the leader of the congregation)?]<br>The Rambam's statement here is difficult to place in perspective. Though in Halachah 9, he accepts the Sages' view (See also Chapter 9, Halachot 2-3) in this halachah, his opinion follows that of Rabban Gamliel. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that after the Sages instituted the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> to allow the leader of the congregation to prepare his prayers, even Rabban Gamliel would agree that all the individuals praying in a <i>minyan</i> also fulfill their obligation to pray by reciting their own prayers. Still it is difficult to understand why the Rambam would have the individuals forfeit the higher quality of communal prayer in order to pray individually.<br>In his notes to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rav Chayim Soloveichik writes that to take into consideration the Rambam's statements in this halachah, after concluding his individual prayers, each person should stand and listen to the prayer of the leader of the congregation and thus, fulfill the mitzvah of communal prayer. Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, which compares answering to the <i>chazan's</i> prayer to reciting a voluntary prayer (See Chapter 1, Halachah 9). By doing so, one will have both the advantages of individual and communal prayer.<br>", "This should not be done with fewer than ten - See Halachot 4 and 5.<br>", "adult - Males who have reached the age of thirteen years and a day and manifested signs of physical maturity. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:19.)<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this halachah from <i>Berachot</i> 47b-48a which allows for the inclusion of a child in the <i>zimmun</i> for the grace after meals. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:7.) We assume that this leniency was granted only in regard to grace, but not in regard to prayer. See also <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 91:3.<br>Many Halachic authorities do not accept this conclusion. In his siddur, Rav Sa'adia Gaon rules that a child may be counted as the tenth in a <i>minyan</i>. Similarly, the <i>Ba'al HaMe'or</i> holds that even up to four minors may be counted in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 55:4), rules that a minor may not be included in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer. The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted. There are opinions that in such a case, the minor must be at least six years old, understand that prayer is service to God, and hold a <i>chumash</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 55:5, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 55:5).<br>", "free males - i.e., excluding a Canaanite slave. However, a Jewish slave (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9) may be counted as part of a <i>minyan</i>. <i>Berachot</i> 47b relates that once, Rabbi Eliezer entered the synagogue and finding only nine people there, freed his slave to complete the quorum of ten.<br>", "The leader of the congregation is [counted as] one of them. - Though there is no explicit source to this effect, a number of midrashim (e.g., <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 23:4) lead to this conclusion.<br>One of the communal rites listed in <i>Megillah</i> 23b which requires a <i>minyan</i> is \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd - the blessing one utters to those in mourning. For the recitation of that blessing, the presence of ten men other than the mourner himself is required. (See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 13:1.) Perhaps the Rambam feels that this statement is necessary to clearly distinguish between the different requirements of a <i>minyan</i> for prayer and \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05ea \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd.<br>", "Even if some of them have already prayed and fulfilled their obligation, they can complete the [quorum of] ten - Though they do not pray together with the others, their presence in the room where the others pray can complete a <i>minyan</i>.<br>", "provided the majority of the ten have not prayed. -<i>Soferim</i> 10:7 states:Our Sages in the West say [that <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>barchu</i> may be recited] even with seven.

However, the Rambam's opinion is universally accepted as halachah.<br>Similarly, we should not recite Kedushah, - See Chapter 7, Halachah 17.<br>In the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is customary to recite three verses in the <i>Kedushah</i>:a) \"Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the entire earth is full of His glory\" (Isaiah 6:3 ;b) \"Blessed be the glory of God from His place\" (Ezekiel 3:12 ;c) \"The Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, throughout all generations\" (Psalms 146:10 .<br>Only the first two of these verses are recited in the <i>Kedushah</i> of the blessings before the <i>Shema</i>. However, in the<i>Kedushah</i> recited at the end of the service, a verse similar to Psalms 146:10 is also included.<br>The commentaries debate the definition of <i>Kedushah</i> and therefore, question which passage the Rambam requires to be omitted when one prays alone. The Rambam's statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, appear to define <i>Kedushah</i> as only the first of these three verses.<br>", "read the Torah with its blessings - i.e., the reading of the Torah as part of the prayer service.

If people want to fulfill their obligation to recite the blessings associated with the <i>Shema</i> by answering \"Amen\" to the <i>chazan's</i> blessings instead of reciting those blessings themselves, a quorum of ten is required.

The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 12:7) associates shaving with the practices of gentile priests. Many Rabbis have strongly encouraged growing a beard even when there is no question of violating the prohibition against shaving. (See <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> 7, <i>Shibolei Leket</i> Vol. II, 41.)<br>However, in communities where removing one's facial hair in a permitted manner is an accepted practice, the lack of a beard is not considered as a deterrent against a person serving as a <i>chazan</i>.<br>", "should not be appointed as the leader of the congregation even if he be a wise man of great stature, as a gesture of respect to the congregation. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:6) states that this only refers to the appointment of a permanent <i>chazan</i>. However, Rabbenu Nissim interprets the Rambam's words as meaning that even on occasion, a youth should not serve as a <i>chazan</i>. See also Chapter 15, Halachah 4.<br>", "However, he may recite the Shema publicly - <i>haporeis al Shema</i> as described in Halachah 5. See <i>Megillah</i> 24a.<br>", "after he has reached the age of thirteen and manifested signs of physical maturity. - until then, he is a minor and incapable of fulfilling the obligation of prayer on behalf of an adult.<br>"], "Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.12": ["Similarly, the inarticulate who pronounce an alef as an ayin or an ayin as an alef - <i>Megillah</i> 24b relates that a <i>chazan</i> should not be appointed from Beit Shean or Haifa, since they mispronounce these letters. Rashi explains that such mispronunciations will cause blessings to be read as curses. For example, if the word, \u05d9\u05d0\u05e8, the first word of the second priestly blessing, \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05da \u2018\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d0\u05e8, is read with an \u05e2 instead of an \u05d0, it becomes a curse.<br>", "or one who cannot articulate the letters in the proper manner should not be appointed as the leader of a congregation. - For many Jews today, this halachah is rather difficult to observe since we do not differentiate between the pronunciation of an <i>alef</i> and an <i>ayin</i> or a <i>sin</i> and a <i>samech</i>. The Radbaz and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> write that if these pronunciation errors are commonplace, even someone who pronounces a <i>chet</i> as a <i>hay</i> or a <i>shin</i> as a <i>sin</i> may serve as a <i>chazan</i>. See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 53:16, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 53:37-38.<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> also cites Chapter 15, Halachah 1, from which it appears that a person who stutters, lisps, or has another speech defect which prevents him from pronouncing the letters properly should not serve as a <i>chazan</i>.<br>A teacher may appoint one of his students to lead the prayers in his presence. - even if the student lacks the above qualities (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Though the previous halachah stated that the leader of the congregation should be the man of the greatest stature in the community, the mishnah (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) and similarly, several sources throughout the Talmud (See <i>Berachot</i> 33b) indicate that a teacher could appoint a student to serve as a <i>chazan</i> instead of doing so himself.<br>The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that this refers to a student who does not articulate the letters properly. Though such a person should not ordinarily serve as a <i>chazan</i>, if he is appointed by his teacher he may. Thus, we find that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi appointed Rabbi Chiya as a <i>chazan</i> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 85b) even though he would pronounce a <i>chet</i> as a <i>hay</i> (<i>Megillah</i> 24b).<br>", "A blind person may recite the Shema publicly - even though the first blessing before the <i>Shema</i> thanks God for creating light, a blind person also benefits from light (<i>Megillah</i> <i>ibid.</i>).<br>", "and serve as the leader of a congregation. - Perhaps the Rambam thought it necessary to clarify this point because there was a difference of opinion among the Sages as to whether a blind person is obligated in all the mitzvot or not. The Sages concluded that he is obligated. Hence, he can also fulfill the obligations of others as the leader of the congregation.<br>", "A person whose shoulders are uncovered - though he may recite the <i>Shema</i> publicly - may not serve as the leader of the congregation until he is covered by a cloak. - <i>Soferim</i> 14:15 understands this as a gesture of respect for the congregation. See also <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 17b which states that when God taught Moses the thirteen attributes of mercy, \"He robed himself as a <i>chazan</i>.\"<br>This does not necessarily refer to wearing a <i>tallit gadol</i>, but rather to a cloak or jacket that covers his shoulders and arms (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 53:13). However, in many communities, it is customary for a <i>chazan</i> to wear a <i>tallit</i> as a token of respect for the community.<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.1": ["in order that one will approach eating matzah with appetite.

In contrast --", "greater leniency applies on the eve of Sabbaths or other festivals -- The Rambam's statements require some explanation: In <i>Hilchot Yom Tov</i> 6:16, the Rambam states:It is proper for a person not to dine on the day before a festival from the time of Minchah onward, as on the day before the Sabbath.The latter phrase is a reference to <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:4, which states:A person may eat and drink [on Friday] until nightfall. Nevertheless, as part of the honor given to the Shabbat, a person should refrain from scheduling a meal from the time of Minchah onward.Thus, on the day before the Sabbath and other festivals, a person should not schedule an important meal. However, he may partake of a casual meal and continue eating. On Pesach, even the latter is forbidden.<br>", "one may continue eating until darkness. -- at which time one is required to cease eating.

Therefore, a person who does not taste that bitterness does not fulfill his obligation.<br>Alternatively, certain texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (and <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid.) read \"A person who swallows maror fulfills his obligation.\" The proponents of this text maintain that it is impossible to swallow a piece of maror the size of an olive without feeling some bitterness. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (475:3) quotes the former text.<br>", "A person who swallows matzah and maror together fulfills the obligation of matzah -- as above. There is an added undesirable factor in eating matzah in this manner. Preferably, no other substances should be eaten with the matzah, so that only its taste will be sensed. (Indeed, were he to chew both the matzah and the maror, he would not fulfill his obligation (See <i>Pesachim</i> 115a). To insure that nothing negate the taste of the matzah, in many communities it is customary not to dip the matzah in salt when eating it at the seder).<br>", "but not that of maror, for the maror is secondary to the matzah. -- The Ra'avad raises a question, noting that the latter phrase is not an explanation why one does not fulfill the mitzvah of maror.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's intention is to explain why the person fulfills the mitzvah of matzah. One might argue that the maror, like the fibers mentioned in the following clause, would prevent one from fulfilling the mitzvah of matzah. Therefore, the Rambam explains that \"the maror is secondary...\"<br>It must be noted that according to the second version of the text mentioned above, the passage reads with no difficulty whatsoever.<br>", "If he wrapped them in fibers or the like and swallowed them -- the matzah, maror, and fibers<br>", "he does not even fulfill the obligation of matzah -- for unlike the maror, the fibers are considered as an interruption between the person's digestive system and the matzah. The fibers are placed in this category because they are not food in their own right. (A similar concept is stated in <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTum'ah</i> 3:5.) In contrast, all other foods are considered secondary to the matzah and, hence not an interruption (<i>Pri Chadash</i>).<br>"], "Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.3": ["A person who eats matzah without the intention [to fulfill the mitzvah] -- This halachah touches on a question left unresolved by the Talmud (see <i>Pesachim</i> 114b), and which has become a source of debate and discussion among the Rabbis in subsequent generations.

Nevertheless, the commentaries qualify the Rambam's statements, based on <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:4:A person who occupies himself with blowing shofar to learn does not fulfill his obligation... one does not fulfill his obligation until both the person hearing [the shofar] and the one sounding it intend to fulfill the obligation.In resolution, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that to fulfill his obligation, the person being forced to eat the matzah must know that today is Pesach, that he is obligated to eat matzah, and that it is matzah which he is eating. Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage from <i>Keritot</i> 19b.<br>Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only \u05de\u05ea\u05e2\u05e1\u05e7 (performing a deed without any thought). However, a person who eats forbidden foods or engages in forbidden sexual relations in this manner is liable, because he derived pleasure from his activities.<br>Similarly, in the present context, since the person derived physical satisfaction from eating the matzah, even though he was forced to do so, the action is attributed to him. In contrast, since his body did not benefit from hearing the shofar, he does not fulfill his obligation until he hears the shofar blown in the proper manner.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 475:4) quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> opinion as regards <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> adds the explanation mentioned in the name of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. (It must be noted that the <i>Pri Chadash</i> and other commentaries do not accept this decision). In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 589:8, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes the Rambam's decision concerning blowing the shofar, stating that a \u05de\u05ea\u05e2\u05e1\u05e7 does not fulfill the mitzvah.

Similarly, certain manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> contain both verses. The fact that the mitzvah to eat matzah is derived from the verse in Exodus and not the verse in Deuteronomy tends to support the text which quotes both verses. However, <i>Pesachim</i> 35a, the source for the exegesis of this verse, only mentions one verse.<br>", "states: \"Do not eat chametz upon it... eat matzot for seven days.\" From the verse's association of chametz and matzah, [we may derive:] substances which can become leavened -- that would become leavened if left unattended for the required period.<br>", "may be eaten as matzah to fulfill one's obligation -- as evident from the following halachah, the actual dough used to make the matzah need not have the potential to become leavened.

Hence, there is no limit to the quantity of wheat required. In contrast, other <i>kitniyot</i> do not \"accept\" the flavor of wheat so easily (nor does rice \"accept\" the flavor of the other four species of grain).

Furthermore, every stage of its preparation should be carried out with the intent that it be used to fulfill the mitzvah.

There is a slight difficulty with this statement. The halachah cited states that only water should be used for the matzah. The Radbaz (Vol. III, Responsum 1074) states that only the four liquids mentioned here may not be used, for only they change the taste of the matzah appreciably.

The latter opinion is compatible with the Rambam's decision. However, according to the former opinion, it appears that an <i>androgynous</i> would resemble a person who is half slave and half free.

Rather, he, as does Rav Yitzchak Alfasi (the Rif), maintains that the halachah follows the latter opinion.<br>Furthermore, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that even according to the former opinion, it is possible to differentiate between an <i>androgynous</i> and one who is half slave and half free, the former condition being brought about by God; the latter, by man.<br>", "A tumtum cannot facilitate the performance of the mitzvah [for anyone], whether of his kind or not of his kind, for - in his case, the doubt is not about the general category, but an individual question about the particular <i>tumtum's</i> nature<br>", "if [the layer of skin covering] the tumtum's [genitalia] is cut open, it is possible that it will be discovered that the tumtum is a male - and the <i>teki'ot</i> he blows are acceptable.<br>", "but it is possible that it will be discovered that the tumtum is a female - and hence, unable to blow the shofar for a male.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.3": ["A person who is half slave and half free cannot even facilitate the performance of the mitzvah - by blowing the shofar<br>", "for himself - let alone for others,<br>", "because the aspect of himself which is a slave cannot facilitate the performance of the mitzvah for the aspect of himself which is free. - Every activity performed by such an individual is considered as a combined effort carried out by both aspects of his being.

Hearing the shofar is a complete act in and of itself. Hence, since the free side of the person has heard the shofar, he is considered to have performed the mitzvah. In contrast, the blowing of the shofar is merely the preparation for the fulfillment of the mitzvah. Hence, the free side of the person cannot fulfill his obligation by hearing <i>tekiot</i> which were produced by a person whose entire being was not obligated to perform the mitzvah.<br>Based on this explanation, we can understand how such a person fulfills the mitzvah of lulav, for there as well, the act of taking the lulav constitutes rather than prepares for, the fulfilment of the mitzvah.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.4": ["A person who occupies himself with blowing the shofar in order to learn - without the intention of fulfilling the mitzvah of hearing the shofar<br>", "does not fulfill his obligation. Similarly, one who hears the shofar - even though he desires to fulfill the mitzvah<br>", "from a person who blows it casually - without the intention of facilitating his colleague's performance of the mitzvah<br>", "does not fulfill his obligation. - for he has heard an unacceptable shofar blast (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 589:5).<br>These laws relate to a question of a much larger scope: Must a person who performs a mitzvah have the intention of doing so or not? <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b, which is the source for these decisions, maintains that such intention is necessary. However, other Talmudic sources imply that there is no need for such intention. Whenever a person performs the deed of a mitzvah, he fulfills his obligation, regardless of his intention.<br>On the surface, the Rambam's own decisions regarding this question appear paradoxical. <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:3 states:A person who eats matzah without the intention [of fulfilling the mitzvah] - e.g., if gentiles or thieves force him to eat - fulfills his obligation.There, it appears that the Rambam does not require a person to have the intention to fulfill a mitzvah, for in this instance the only reason the person ate the matzah was the coercion of the gentiles.<br>The commentaries attempt to resolve the issue. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that to fulfill his obligation, the person being forced to eat the matzah must know that today is Pesach, that he is obligated to eat matzah, and that it is matzah which he is eating. Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage.<br>Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only \u05de\u05ea\u05e2\u05e1\u05e7 (performing a deed without any thought). However, a person who eats forbidden foods or engages in forbidden sexual relations in this manner is liable, because he derived pleasure from his activities (<i>Keritot</i> 19b).<br>Similarly, since the person derived physical satisfaction from eating the matzah, even though he was forced to do so, the action is attributed to him. In contrast, since his body did not benefit from hearing the shofar, he does not fulfill his obligation until he hears the shofar blown in the proper manner.<br>As regards <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, in <i>Orach Chayim</i> 589:8, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes the Rambam's decision concerning blowing the shofar, stating that a \u05de\u05ea\u05e2\u05e1\u05e7 does not fulfill the mitzvah. Similar decisions are rendered concerning <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60) and lulav and etrog (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651).<br>Concerning matzah, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 475:4 quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>'s opinion, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> adds the explanation mentioned in the name of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. (Even so, the <i>Pri Chadash</i> and other commentaries do not accept this decision.)<br>", "If the person hearing had the intention of fulfilling his obligation, but the person blowing did not have the intention of facilitating the latter's performance of the mitzvah - <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28b quotes Rabbi Zeira as instructing Shamaya: \"Have me in mind and blow for me.\"<br>", "or the person blowing had the intention of facilitating his colleague's performance of the mitzvah, but the person hearing did not have the intention of fulfilling his obligation, [the person hearing] did not fulfill his obligation. - The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (189:4) states that if a person comes to the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah with the intention to fulfill his obligation to hear the shofar, that intention is sufficient. Even if he has no specific intention while the shofar is being blown, he fulfills his obligation.<br>", "Rather, both the person hearing and the one allowing him to hear - i.e., the person blowing the shofar<br>", "must have the [proper] intention.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.5": ["If a person blew the shofar with the intention of enabling all those hearing his blowing to perform the mitzvah - The blower need not have each individual in mind. However, as the previous halachah states, he must have the intention that his blowing enable people to fulfill their obligation to hear shofar. If he blows without that intention, their listening is of no consequence.<br>", "and a listener heard while having the intention to fulfill his obligation - However, as stated in the previous halachah, if the listener lacks that intention, he does not fulfill his obligation.<br>", "even though the person blowing did not have a specific intention that this individual would hear his blowing, nor did he know about him - the listener has fulfilled his obligation, because the blower had in mind all those who heard him. - <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29a derives this principle by contrasting the law mentioned in the previous halachah with the law mentioned in this halachah's latter clause.<br>", "Accordingly, if a person was traveling on a journey - The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (589:5) explains that a person who continues traveling must be sure that he has the intention of fulfilling his obligation. However, if he stops to hear the shofar, that itself is sufficient proof that he desires to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>", "or was sitting in his home and heard the teki'ot from the person leading the congregation, he has fulfilled his obligation if he had that intention, since the leader of the congregation had the intention of enabling the many to fulfill their obligation. - In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 3:5), the Rambam writes: \"the [function of] leader of the congregation was instituted in that capacity only in order to enable the many to fulfill their obligation.\"<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.6": ["If the festival of Rosh Hashanah falls on the Sabbath - According to the fixed calendar we use, Rosh Hashanah never falls on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday (<i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 7:1). Thus, the second day of Rosh Hashanah will never fall on the Sabbath. However, it is not at all infrequent for the first day of Rosh Hashanah to fall on the Sabbath.<br>", "the shofar is not sounded in every place. - However, it is sounded in certain places, as explained in Halachot 8 and 9. There is an allusion to this in the Torah itself. Though Numbers 10:10 describes Rosh Hashanah as a day of \"the sounding of the shofar,\" Leviticus 23:24 refers to it as a day of \"the remembrance of the sounding [of the shofar\" - i.e., this refers to Rosh Hashanah which falls on the Sabbath, when the shofar is not actually sounded (Rashi, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a).<br>", "[This law was enacted] even though blowing [the shofar] was forbidden only as sh'vut. - See the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4 for a definition of the term <i>sh'vut</i>. <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b equates the blowing of the shofar with removing bread from the oven. It appears from <i>Shabbat</i> 117b that the removal of bread from the oven was forbidden only because it is \"a weekday act,\" not in the spirit of the Sabbath. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 588:4.)<br>", "It would be appropriate for [the shofar] to be sounded, for a positive commandment of the Torah should supersede sh'vut instituted by the Sages. - A question can be raised, based on the Rambam's statements in Chapter 1, Halachah 4:Regarding a shofar to be used on Rosh Hashanah: It is forbidden to violate the festival's laws to obtain it. This applies even when the forbidden practice is in the category of <i>sh'vut</i>.The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> offers a number of resolutions to this difficulty. Among them:<br>a) Had the proper attention been paid to the matter before Rosh Hashanah, the <i>sh'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 with regard to obtaining the shofar would not exist. In contrast, the <i>sh'vut</i> involved in blowing the shofar cannot be avoided.<br>b) The <i>sh'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 must be violated before the mitzvah is performed. Hence, there is no way the prohibition can be relaxed in the mere expectation that a mitzvah will be performed. In contrast, in this instance, the performance of the mitzvah and the <i>sh'vut</i> occur concurrently.<br>However, the order of the halachot here suggests a different explanation. As the Rambam states in the following halachah, certain leniencies are taken regarding the <i>sh'vut</i> of sounding the shofar on Rosh Hashanah (since, as mentioned above, it is forbidden only because it is a \"weekday act\"). In contrast, the activities mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 are of a more severe nature, and hence no leniency may be taken in their regard.<br>", "If so, why is the shofar not sounded? Because of a decree [of the Sages] lest a person take it in his hands and carry it to a colleague so that the latter can blow for him - The Rambam alters the expression used by <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b, which states: \"perhaps he will take it to a skilled person so that the latter will teach him.\" Perhaps, the emendation was made because it is more likely that a person would desire that his colleague blow for him than begin to teach him on Rosh Hashanah itself.<br>", "and [in the process,] carry it four cubits in the public domain or transfer it from one domain to another - <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 12:8 equates the two and explains the nature of this <i>melachah</i>. It must be noted that the phrase \"transfer it from one domain...\" is the Rambam's addition and does not appear in <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid. (Indeed, <i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> 4b explains that there is no suspicion that the latter prohibition will be violated.)<br>", "and thus violate a prohibition punishable by being stoned to death - as is the commission of all Shabbat <i>melachot</i> (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 1:1-2.)<br>", "[This is necessary because] all are obligated in the mitzvah of blowing the shofar, but not all are skilled in it. - A similar expression is also found in <i>Hilchot Megillah</i> 1:13, explaining why the Megillah is never read on the Sabbath. It must be noted that while the Temple was standing, a similar decree was not enacted on the first day of Sukkot which fell on the Sabbath, even though it is possible that a person would carry his lulav in a forbidden manner. Note our commentary on Chapter 7, Halachot 13 and 14, which explains the difference between the two festivals.<br>The fact that a Rabbinic decree can cause a mitzvah to be nullified - particularly as significant a mitzvah as the blowing of the shofar - has been the subject of much discussion by the Rabbis. In his commentary on the tractate of <i>Sukkah</i>, Rabbenu Nissim states that this decree was instituted only because in most Jewish communities, the people were not aware of the date the Rabbis had established for Rosh Hashanah. Hence, since the people could not be sure that they were in fact performing a mitzvah, the Rabbinic decree had the power to negate its performance. Even in the places where they were conscious of the proper date, they would not blow the shofar in such a year, so that great divisions in Torah practice would not be created among the Jewish people.<br>In <i>Likkutei Torah</i>, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains the matter from a mystical perspective. He writes that the Sabbath itself generates spiritual influences which resemble those produced by the blowing of the shofar. Thus, there is no necessity to blow the shofar, and the Sages were therefore willing to allow such a decree to negate its observance.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.7": ["Children who have not reached an age at which they can be educated - Rabbenu Manoach explains that this refers to children of six or seven.<br>", "We need not prevent them from blowing [the shofar] on a Sabbath - even though blowing the shofar on the Sabbath is prohibited for an adult<br>", "which is not the festival of Rosh Hashanah, so that they will learn [to blow]. - This halachah is not directly related to the laws of Rosh Hashanah, but rather to the laws of the Sabbath. If a child has not reached the age where he can be educated concerning the mitzvot, his parents are not required to prevent him from violating any of the mitzvot (<i>Yevamot</i> 114a).<br>The law stated here represents a reversal of the Rambam's understanding of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33a from that in his commentary on the Mishnah. Indeed, his change in interpretation caused the Ra'avad to object to this halachah. It is interesting to note that the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:9) and the primary interpretation mentioned in the <i>Halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchak Alfasi (the Rif) - sources which the Rambam relies upon heavily - follow the Rambam's initial approach.<br>", "An adult is permitted to be involved in the instruction [of children - He may tell them to blow the shofar and teach them how to blow (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>", "in the blowing of shofar] on the festival. - even though the blowing of the shofar is prohibited on the Sabbath.<br>", "[This applies] concerning both children who have reached an age at which they can be educated and those who have not reached that age, for blowing [the shofar] is prohibited only as <i>sh'vut</i>. - Since the prohibition against blowing the shofar is not severe, a number of leniencies are taken in this regard. The shofar is sounded for women (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 589:6), and similarly, additional blasts are sounded to \"upset Satan\" (Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i>, 596:1). However, it is forbidden for an adult to sound the shofar on Rosh Hashanah unnecessarily. Nevertheless, even a child who has reached the age when he is educated concerning the mitzvot need not follow this stringency (Ramah, ibid.).<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.8": ["When [the Sages] decreed not to sound [the shofar] on the Sabbath, they applied that decree only to places which lacked a court. - The Sages forbade sounding the shofar on the Sabbath lest someone carry it in a forbidden manner, as explained in the previous halachah. However, that decree was not applied to places where the Sanhedrin, Israel's supreme court, held its sessions. The influence of the court would be felt throughout the entire city and its surroundings. Hence, the people would be more scrupulous in their observance of the mitzvot.

He disagrees with the Rambam on two points:<br>a) while the Temple was standing, the Rambam maintains that the shofar was sounded throughout Jerusalem, while the Ra'avad maintains that it was sounded in the Temple alone.<br>b) after the Temple's destruction, the Rambam maintains that the shofar was not sounded in Jerusalem, while the Ra'avad argues that it was.<br>The difference between the two depends on the Rambam's interpretation of the Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:1):When the festival of Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath, they would sound the shofar in the <i>Mikdash</i>, but not in the country at large.In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam writes: \"We have already explained to you several times (see <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:4, <i>Shekalim</i> 1:3, <i>Sukkah</i> 3:10) that the term <i>mikdash</i> refers to the entire city of Jerusalem.\" Thus, he maintains that if Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath while the Temple was standing, the shofar would be sounded throughout the city. After the destruction of the Temple, this practice was discontinued.<br>", "[This did not apply] to the people of Jerusalem alone. - The influence of the Sanhedrin could be felt even on the outskirts of the city.<br>", "Rather, every city that was within the outer limits - This refers to the \u05ea\u05d7\u05d5\u05dd \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea - 2000 cubits from the outermost house from each point on the city's circumference.

However, the sound would not carry that far.<br>", "and travel to Jerusalem - i.e., excluding those separated by a wadi - which they would be unable to cross<br>", "from the city - The exclusions mentioned by the Rambam are quoted from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid., based on the text of the Mishnah. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:1) interprets the Mishnah slightly differently.<br>", "the people of these cities would blow the shofar on the Sabbath as in Jerusalem.

Only a judge who himself possesses <i>semichah</i> can convey this distinction to a colleague. Moses gave Joshua and the seventy elders <i>semichah</i>, and they began a chain that stretched over many generations, ending several hundred years after the destruction of the Temple. (See <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 4:1-2.)<br>", "in Eretz Yisrael - <i>semichah</i> could be conveyed only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> (ibid.:6).<br>", "permanently holds sessions - i.e., if, on Rosh Hashanah, the court held special sessions in a city where it was not normally located, the shofar would not be sounded. (See the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:1.)<br>", "the shofar is sounded on the Sabbath. - The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b) states:When the Temple was destroyed, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai ordained that the shofar be sounded in every place where a court holds sessions.The Talmud elaborates:[After the destruction of the Temple,] Rosh Hashanah once fell on the Sabbath, and all the cities gathered together [in Yavneh]. Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai asked the family of Beteira: \"Shall we blow?\"<br>\"Let us consider the matter,\" they replied to him.<br>\"Let us blow, and then consider the matter after having blown,\" he answered them.<br>\"Let us consider the matter,\" they replied again.<br>He told them, \"The sounding of a horn has already been heard in Yavneh. Once a deed has been performed, no further discussion is entertained.\"", "Furthermore, the shofar is sounded on the Sabbath only in a court that has sanctified the new moon. - Originally, the months were sanctified by the courts after hearing the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon. (See <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i>, Chapters 1 and 2.)<br>", "However, the shofar will not be sounded in other courts, even though their judges have received <i>semichah</i>. - The Rambam's statements represent a middle road in a difference of opinion between the Rabbinical giants upon whom our understanding of the Talmud is based. Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29a) states that the shofar was sounded on the Sabbath only in the presence of the Supreme Sanhedrin. Thus, this law applied only in Yavneh and in the few other cities where the Sanhedrin subsequently held its session.<br>Rav Yitzchak Alfasi (the Rif) quotes this law in his <i>Halachot</i> even though he quotes only those laws which are applicable in his age. From this it appears that he maintains that the shofar may be sounded in the presence of any court of stature on the Sabbath, even if its judges do not possess <i>semichah</i>. Indeed, the Ramban and Rabbenu Nissim write that Rav Yitzchak Alfasi would have the shofar sounded in his own court when Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath. Similarly, the text <i>Haezer</i> records that the author saw a Sage from Damascus who stated that he saw the shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah which fell on a Sabbath.<br>(The Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, ibid., does not mention the need for the judges to possess <i>semichah</i>. Thus, it is possible that he also originally subscribed to this view.)<br>In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam's position lies in between these views. On one hand, unlike Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, he requires that the judges possess <i>semichah</i> and be of sufficient stature to have sanctified the new moon (thus, excluding any contemporary courts). Nevertheless, unlike Rashi, he allows the shofar to be sounded in the presence of any court that has those qualifications, and not the Supreme Sanhedrin alone.<br>", "Also, the shofar is sounded only in the presence of a high court - Our translation of \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d3\u05d9\u05df \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc is based on the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who explains that in this context the term refers to an established court of judges with <i>semichah</i>, and not the Supreme Sanhedrin, as is sometimes the case. Indeed, authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from Yemen omit the word \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc from the above expression.<br>", "It may be sounded during the entire time they are in session. - but only while they are in session. If they have risen, the shofar can no longer be sounded. However...<br>", "Even after they - the judges<br>", "have begun preparing to rise - as long as they have not risen - the shofar may be sounded before them - Though the Sages (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 30a) raised a question on this matter and left it unanswered, the Rambam allows the shofar to be sounded under such circumstances. Since the question concerns a Rabbinic decree, the more lenient approach is taken (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>", "However, outside the court, the shofar may not be sounded. - In this aspect, there was a difference between the sounding of the shofar on the Sabbath between Jerusalem and Yavneh. In Jerusalem, the influence of the Temple and the court was felt so strongly that even outside the presence of the court, the shofar could be sounded. In contrast, in Yavneh and other cities where courts were located, the shofar was sounded only in the presence of a court (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.).<br>", "Why is the shofar allowed to be sounded in the court? Because the court is scrupulous [in the observance of the mitzvot] and, in its presence, those who blow the shofar will not carry the shofar in the public domain, for the court will warn the people and inform them. - The <i>S'dei Chemed</i> derives a general principle from this law. <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:27 states that all Sabbath and festival prohibitions that were categorized as <i>sh'vut</i> were suspended in the Temple, because the priests were scrupulous in their observance of the mitzvot and there was no danger that any infringement of Torah law would occur. Similarly, the above text continues, all decrees of this nature may be suspended in the presence of a high court, because the court will ensure that the Torah's laws will be kept.<br>This logic runs contrary to a statement of Rabbenu Nissim, who writes that although Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai instituted the blowing of the shofar on the Sabbath in the presence of a court, he was not that lenient regarding the taking of the lulav and etrog. Thus, we see that the leniency mentioned here applies to the shofar alone and not to other cases.<br>"], "Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.10": ["In the present age, when we celebrate Rosh Hashanah in the exile for two days - There is a slight imprecision with the Rambam's statements. Rosh Hashanah was celebrated for two days throughout almost the totality of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> even while the Temple was standing. It was impossible to notify the people in most of the land (for the messengers were not allowed to travel more than two thousand cubits beyond Jerusalem) whether or not the court had substantiated the testimony of the witnesses on the day when Rosh Hashanah was expected to fall. (See <i>Beitzah</i> 4b-5a; <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 5:7-8.)<br>", "the shofar is sounded on the second day just as it is sounded on the first. - This refers to the actual sounding of the shofar.

Among the possible resolutions to this difficulty are:<br>a) as the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 5:3, until the age of Abbaye and Ravvah, there were courts of judges who sanctified the new month based on the testimony of witnesses. Thus, the Rambam could be referring to such a court.<br>b) In <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 4:11, the Rambam discusses the possibility of the renewal of the practice of <i>semichah</i>. He could be referring to such an eventuality in the present instance.<br>", "may blow the shofar on the second day alone. - This is our practice at present.<br>"], "Fasts 5.1": ["There are days when the entire Jewish people - All healthy adult men and women<br>", "fast - It appears that the Rambam considers these fasts to be obligatory in the present era. Based on his interpretation of <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 18b in his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 1:3, the Rambam explains that in the era of the Second Temple, these fasts were of an optional nature. After the destruction of the Temple, however, every Jew is required to observe them. This obligation is also explicitly stated by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 549:1, 550:1).<br>", "because of the calamities that occurred to them then - Here, the Rambam employs the same principle he developed at the beginning of this text regarding fasts instituted because of difficulties of an immediate nature, with regard to these fasts which were instituted for these national calamities.<br>Fasting in and of itself is not a purpose. Fasting can, however, serve<br>", "to arrouse [their] hearts and initiate [them in] the paths of repentance. - This is the intent of the fasts, and not merely refraining from eating. For this reason, the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 121:1 harshly reproves those who fast, but spend their days taking pleasure strolls and being involved in other forms of leisure activity.<br>", "This will serve as a reminder of our wicked conduct and that of our ancestors, which resembles our present conduct and therefore brought these calamities upon them and upon us. - Although these tragedies took place in previous generations, we share the responsibility for them. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 1:1) states, \"Every generation in which the Temple is not rebuilt should consider it as if it was destroyed in its days.\"<br>", "By reminding ourselves of these matters, we will repent - The word \u05e0\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1, translated as \"we will repent,\" literally means, \"We will return.\" <i>Teshuvah</i> involves a return to one's fundamental self, becoming aware of the fundamental Divine nature one possesses.<br>Such a process relates to these commemorative fasts, which on the surface are associated with undesirable elements, but possess a positive core, as reflected in the Rambam's statements at the conclusion of this chapter that in the era of the Redemption, all these fast days will be transformed into days of rejoicing and celebration.<br>", "and improve [our conduct], as [Leviticus 26:40] states: \"And they will confess their sin and the sin of their ancestors.\" - See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 1:1-2, 2:2, where the Rambam associates the mitzvah of teshuvah with confession.<br>"], "Fasts 5.2": ["These days are the following: - The Rambam lists these fasts, not in the order in which the events which they commemorate transpired, nor according to the order in which they are mentioned in Zechariah 8:19 (see Halachah 4), but rather in the order of the year, beginning from the month of Tishrei.<br>", "The Third of Tishrei.

As the siege persisted, their supply of lambs dwindled, and on the Seventeenth of Tammuz, there no longer were any lambs to sacrifice (Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:6).<br>Significantly, other commentaries (Rashi, <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i>) on the Mishnah identify the nullification of the sacrifices on the Seventeenth of Tammuz with different events in our history.<br>", "c) [The walls of] Jerusalem were breached in [the war leading to] the destruction of the Second Temple; - Jeremiah 39:2 states that in the destruction of the First Temple, Jerusalem's walls fell to the Babylonian conquerors on the ninth of Tammuz. Nevertheless, it is the destruction of the city by the Romans that we commemorate by fasting, because the effects of that destruction are more severe (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 549:2). The Rabbis did not institute a fast for the Ninth of Tammuz as well, for it was felt that this would be an excessive burden for the people (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 549:4).<br>Furthermore, according to the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:8, because of the many difficulties suffered by the Jewish people, they miscalculated the date, and, even during the destruction of the First Temple, it was on the Seventeenth of Tammuz that Jerusalem's walls were breached.<br>", "d) Apostmos, the wicked - a Greek official in the Second Temple era (Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro)<br>", "burned a Torah scroll - The Meiri identifies this as the Torah scroll written by Ezra the Scribe.

It was not until after the destruction of the Temple that the observance of the dates mentioned in <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i> was nullified.

Even if this teaching is not accepted as historical fact, we can glean from it that in Rav Achai's time, shortly after the conclusion of the Talmud, the fast was already a long-standing custom.<br>Significantly, because of the difference in status between it and the other commemorative fasts, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 686:2) rules far more leniently in regard to this fast than in regard to the others.<br>", "If the Thirteenth of Adar falls on the Sabbbath, the fast is pushed forward - It is not postponed until after the Sabbath, because Purim is Sunday and the celebration of Purim cannot be postponed.

This meal should be characterized by mourning and sadness, and these foods bring happiness.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:25) associates Ezekiel 32:27: \"And their sins will be upon their bones\" with eating meat and drinking wine at this meal.<br>", "One may, however, drink grape juice that has not been left [to ferment] for three days. - For it has no alcoholic content, and will not lead to happiness.<br>", "One may eat salted meat that was slaughtered more than three days previously. - The prohibition against eating meat was derived from the fact that with the Temple's destruction, the sacrifices were nullified. Since no sacrificial meat could be eaten on the third day and afterwards, this restriction does not apply to such meat (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 552:5).<br>It must be emphasized that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 552:2) and the later authorities explain that, at present, it is customary to refrain from partaking of even these foods at this meal.<br>", "One should not eat two cooked dishes. - This restriction was instituted because when two or more dishes are served, a meal is considered important, and partaking of such a meal is inappropriate at this time (Rabbenu Asher).<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 552:3-5) discusses in detail what is excluded by the phrase \"two cooked dishes.\"<br>"], "Fasts 5.8": ["When does the - need to observe the restrictions mentioned<br>", "above apply? When one ate [this meal] in the afternoon on the day preceding Tish'ah B'Av. - The governing principle for this and the previous and following halachot is that unlike the meal before the fast on Yom Kippur, the meal before the fast of Tish'ah B'Av is somber in nature. The atmosphere of mourning that prevails throughout the fast has already begun, and therefore, eating a normal meal should be out of the question.<br>", "If, however, one eats a meal before noon, although this is the last meal one eats before the fast, one may eat all that one desires. - For then, one is still far removed from the fast itself.<br>", "When the day before Tish'ah B'Av falls on the Sabbath - the obligation to honor the Sabbath surpasses the need to commemorate the destruction of the Temple. Therefore,<br>", "one may eat and drink to the full extent of one's needs, and one may serve even a meal resembling Solomon's feasts at one's table. - There are some authorities (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>) who recommend observing certain practices associated with mourning at the third Sabbath meal. Their opinions are not, however, accepted as halachah.<br>There is, however, one aspect in which this third Sabbath meal differs from the way this meal is eaten throughout the year. Generally, we are allowed to continue this meal into the night. When the fast of Tish'ah B'Av begins on Sunday, however, we must cease eating at sunset. (See Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 552:10.)<br>", "Similarly, when Tish'ah B'Av falls on the Sabbath - since the observance of the fast is postponed, there is no need to minimize one's Sabbath joy, and<br>", "one need not withhold anything at all. - Significantly, the Rambam does not mention any mourning rites in connection with such a day. In contrast, the decisions of the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:19) reflect the following principles. All expressions of mourning that would be noticed by the public should be forbidden. Those practices of mourning which are private in nature - e.g., the prohibition of sexual relations - should be observed.<br>"], "Fasts 5.10": ["Pregnant women and those who are nursing - although absolved from fasting on the other commemorative fasts<br>", "must complete their fasts on Tish'ah B'Av. - Needless to say, they or any other person who feels that fasting will threaten their health may eat and drink. (See Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:6.)<br>", "[On this day,] it is forbidden to wash in either hot or cold water - for the sake of pleasure. One may, however, wash one's hands to remove filth or for ritual purposes. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and commentaries, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 544:9-10.)<br>", "it is even forbidden to place one's finger in water - without any valid reason. One may, however, pass through water to greet one's teacher or to watch one's crops (<i>ibid.</i>:12-13). Similarly, a woman is allowed to wash food that she will serve children, even though her hands also become wet (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 554:19).<br>The Rambam does not elaborate on these leniencies here, because he has already mentioned them at length with regard to Yom Kippur in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 3:1-7.<br>", "Similarly, anointing oneself for the sake of pleasure - in contrast to anointment for hygienic or medicinal reasons<br>", "wearing - leather<br>", "shoes - is forbidden. One may, however, wear shoes made from other materials. Even leather shoes are permitted in certain instances. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:17.)<br>", "and sexual relations are forbidden - See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 554:37, where the question is raised whether one may touch one's wife or not.<br>", "as on Yom Kippur. - With this phrase, the Rambam refers the reader to his discussion of these prohibitions and the leniencies that may be granted in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i>.<br>", "In places where it is customary to do work - The word \"work\" in this context does not refer to the thirty-nine labors prohibited on the Sabbath, but rather to concentrated activity that would distract one's attention from mourning (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 554:43).<br>", "one may work. - If, however, a person desires to refrain from working because of the unique nature of the day, he may.<br>", "In places where it is not customary to work, one should not. - The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 554:45 states that this is the custom in the Ashkenazic community at present.<br>", "Torah scholars everywhere should remain idle on this day. - For they should set examples to the people at large. Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:6, where he writes that \"Performing work on this day is very disgraceful.\"<br>", "Our Sages said - <i>Ta'anit</i> 30b<br>", "\"Whoever performs work on this day will never see a sign of blessing forever.\" - Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> interpret this as referring to the work performed on Tish'ah B'Av itself. This interpretation is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:24).<br>"], "Fasts 5.11": ["Torah scholars - Indeed, this applies also the people as a whole. Torah scholars are mentioned because they are expected to be more sensitive to the tragedy of our loss on Tish'ah B'Av.<br>The Rambam's choice of wording is based on his interpretation of the <i>Tosefta, Ta'anit</i> 3:11, \"<i>Chaverim</i> should not exchange greetings on Tish'ah B'Av,\" for the term <i>chaverim</i> is often used as a reference to Torah scholars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:20), however, interprets <i>chaverim</i> in its literal sense, that it means \"friends.\"<br>", "should not exchange greetings on Tish'ah B'Av. - Nor should gifts or other social amenities be exchanged (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 554:41).<br>", "Instead, they should sit in agony and frustration like mourners. - Nothing should be done to distract one's attention from the loss.<br>With the above expression, the Rambam also explains the rationale for these laws. When the Sages ordained the commemoration of Tish'ah B'Av, they structured its observance to resemble Yom Kippur in certain contexts, and to resemble the laws of mourning in others.<br>", "If a common person greets them, they should reply to him - lest he become upset, but this should be done<br>", "weakly, in a somber tone. - So that he also appreciates the nature of the day. See also Chapter 3, Halachah 8.<br>", "On Tish'ah B'Av, it is forbidden to read from the Torah, the Prophets, or the Sacred Writings [or to study] the Mishnah, Torah law, the Talmud, or the Aggadic works. - Because \"the precepts of God... make the heart glad\" (Psalms 19:9 . Even this joy is inappropriate on Tish'ah B'Av (<i>Ta'anit</i> 30a).<br>", "One may study only - Torah works that are somber in nature - e.g.,<br>", "Job, - which recounts his grief and suffering over the tribulations which beset him<br>", "Eichah - the Book of Lamentations for the Temple's destruction. This text is read communally on Tish'ah B'Av and may be studied by individuals as well.<br>", "and the prophecies of retribution in Jeremiah. - In addition, one may study the Talmudic passages describing the Temple's destruction (from the chapter <i>Hanezikin</i>, <i>Gittin</i>, Chapter 5, in the Babylonian Talmud, and the last chapter of <i>Ta'anit</i> in the Jerusalem Talmud), the <i>Midrashim</i> on Eichah, the laws of Tish'ah B'Av, the laws of mourning, and other similar texts.<br>One should, however, recite all the passages from the Bible and the Talmud that are included in the daily prayer service.<br>", "Children should not study in school on this day. - for they also derive happiness from their study (<i>Ta'anit, ibid.</i>).<br>", "There are some sages who do not wear the head tefillin. - A mourner does not wear <i>tefillin</i> on the first day of mourning (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 4:9). In particular, support for this custom is derived from Eichah 2:1, which states, \"He cast down the glory of Israel from the heaven to the earth.\" \"The glory of Israel\" is a reference to <i>tefillin</i>.<br>The Rambam's choice of wording appears to indicate that the arm <i>tefillin</i> may be worn. Similarly, he does not mention any change in practice regarding the <i>tallit gadol.</i> The custom at present in most communities (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 555:1) is not to wear <i>tefillin</i> - neither the head <i>tefillin</i> nor the arm <i>tefillin</i> - nor to wear the <i>tallit gadol</i> in the morning service. A <i>tallit k'tan</i> is worn, but a blessing is not recited over it.<br>For the afternoon service, the <i>tallit gadol</i> and both the head and arm <i>tefillin</i> are worn.<br>"], "Fasts 5.19": ["All these [commemorative] fasts will be nullified in the Messianic era - With the conclusion of the exile, there will be no need to mark the dates that led to it with mourning and fasting. Thus the Rambam writes at the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Megillah</i>: \"All memories of the difficulties [endured by our people] will be nullified as [Isaiah 65:16] states: 'For the former difficulties will be forgotten.'<br>As mentioned previously, fasting is not an end in its own right, but a means to motivate the Jews to return to God and correct the faults in their behavior. The coming of the redemption will be a sign that the service of repentance is complete, and thus there will be no further need for fasting.<br>", "and, indeed, ultimately, they will be transformed - Through repentance, sins are transformed into merits (<i>Yoma</i> 86a). And in this process, these fasts, which came as a result of the exile that stems from sin, will be transformed<br>", "into holidays and days of rejoicing and celebration - There is no possibility for the existence of an entity that is genuinely negative in nature. All those factors that appear negative represent hidden good, and furthermore, a good so powerful that the only way it can be revealed in this world is through qualities that outwardly appear negative. Their inner nature, however, is good, and in the era of the redemption when the world will be refined to the extent that it can accept this great good, this nature will be revealed.<br>", "as [Zechariah 8:19] states: \"Thus declares the Lord of Hosts, 'The fast of the fourth [month] - The Ninth, or at present, the Seventeenth, of Tammuz (see Halachah 4),<br>", "the fast of the fifth [month] - Tish'ah B'Av<br>", "the fast of the seventh [month] - the Third of Tishrei<br>", "and the fast of the tenth [month] - the Tenth of Tevet<br>", "will be [times of] happiness and celebration and festivals for the House of Judah. And they shall love truth and peace.' - Note the interpretation of this verse in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, and the introduction to the tractate of <i>Avot</i> (<i>Shemonah Perakim</i>), Chapter 4. There the Rambam elaborates on how, instead of asceticism and fasting, God desires intellectual development (\"truth\") and emotional harmony (\"peace\").<br>From a different perspective, it can be understood that by quoting the conclusion of the verse, the prophet was also alluding to the means by which the Messianic redemption - and thus the transformation of these fasts - could be brought closer.<br><i>Yoma</i> 9b relates that the Temple was destroyed because of unwarranted hatred among the Jewish people. By spreading peace and truth, we will nullify the cause for the exile, and this will cause the effect, the exile itself, also to cease (<i>Likkutei Sichot,</i> Vol. 15, pp. 415ff.).<br>"]}
