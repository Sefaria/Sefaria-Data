    <td>What is meant by a diviner? This refers to a person who performs certain deeds to cause him to fall into a trance and have his mind cleared of all thoughts until he can predict the future, saying, "This will happen" or "This will not happen;" or saying, "it is proper to do such and such. Be careful to do so." There are some diviners who use sand or stones [to obtain their answers]. Others prostrate themselves on the ground, make strange motions and scream. Others look at a metal or crystal mirror, fantasize, and speak. Still others carry a staff and lean on it and tap with it until they fall into a trance and speak. This is what the prophet [Hoshea <span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">(</span>4:12<span style="background-color: red;"> </span><span style="background-color: green;">)</span> meant by] saying, "My people will inquire of their rods.

Therefore, a person who desires to merit the crown of Torah should be careful with all his nights, not giving up even one to sleep, eating, drinking, talk, or the like. Rather, [they should be devoted to] the study of Torah and the words of wisdom. Our Sages declared: "The song of Torah can [be heard] only at night, as [Eichah 2:19] states: 'Arise, sing out at night...’“ Whoever occupies himself with Torah study at night will have a strand of [Divine] favor extended over him during the day, as [implied by Psalms 42:9]: "During the day, God ordains His kindness and, at night, His song is with me, a prayer to the living God." [In contrast], any house in which the words of Torah cannot be heard at night will be consumed by fire, as [implied by Job 20:26]: "All the darkness is hidden away from His treasures; a fire that need not be blown will consume him."

Our Sages declared: "Whoever neglects Torah study when wealthy will ultimately neglect it amidst poverty. Whoever maintains the Torah in poverty will ultimately maintain it amidst prosperity." This concept is explicitly mentioned in the Torah [Deuteronomy 28:47-48], which states: "Because you did not serve God, your Lord, with happiness and good feeling when there was an abundance of everything, you shall serve your enemies," and [Deuteronomy 8:16] states: "so that you shall suffer...so that ultimately He will make you prosper."</td>

    <td>Walls which are connected to the roof of the sukkah, but do not reach the earth: If they are more than three handbreadths above the earth, they are invalid; if the distance is less than that, they are kosher. [The following rules apply] should the walls be connected to the earth, without reaching the s'chach: If they are ten handbreadths high, they are kosher even though are removed several cubits from the roof, provided they are positioned below the end of the roof. If the roof was separated from the wall by more than three handbreadths, it is invalid; less than this amount is kosher.</td>
