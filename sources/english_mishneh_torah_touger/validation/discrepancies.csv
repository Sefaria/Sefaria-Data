"Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars 11:4","If a king will arise from the House of David who diligently contemplates the Torah and observes its mitzvot as prescribed by the Written Law and the Oral Law as David, his ancestor, will compel all of Israel to walk in (the way of the Torah) and rectify the breaches in its observance, and fight the wars of God, we may, with assurance, consider him Mashiach. If he succeeds in the above, builds the Temple in its place, and gathers the dispersed of Israel, he is definitely the Mashiach. He will then improve the entire world, motivating all the nations to serve God together, as Tzephaniah 3:9 states: 'I will transform the peoples to a purer language that they all will call upon the name of God and serve Him with one purpose.' If he did not succeed to this degree or was killed, he surely is not the redeemer promised by the Torah. Rather, he should be considered as all the other proper and complete kings of the Davidic dynasty who died. God caused him to arise only to test the many, as Daniel 11:35 states: 'And some of the wise men will stumble, to try them, to refine, and to clarify until the appointed time, because the set time is in the future.' Jesus of Nazareth who aspired to be the Mashiach and was executed by the court was also alluded to in Daniel's prophecies, as  11:14 states: 'The vulgar among your people shall exalt themselves in an attempt to fulfill the vision, but they shall stumble.' Can there be a greater stumbling block than Christianity?

"Mishneh Torah, Human Dispositions 3:2","A person should direct his heart and the totality of his behavior to one goal, becoming aware of God, blessed be He. The [way] he rests, rises, and speaks should all be directed to this end. For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. Rather, he should do these things, so that he will be able to obtain that which the body needs - food, drink, a home and a wife. Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure to the point where he will eat and drink only that which is sweet to the palate and engage in intercourse for pleasure. Rather, he should take care to eat and drink only in order to be healthy in body and limb. Therefore, he should not eat all that the palate desires like a dog or a donkey. Rather, he should eat what is beneficial for the body, be it bitter or sweet. Conversely, he should not eat what is harmful to the body, even though it is sweet to the palate. For example: a person with a warm constitution should not eat meat or honey, nor drink wine, as Solomon has stated in a parable: The eating of much honey is not good (Proverbs 25:27 . One should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter, for then, he will be eating and drinking for medical reasons only, in order to become healthy and be whole - for a man cannot exist without eating and drinking.

Therefore, he should not engage in intercourse whenever he feels desire, but when he knows that he requires a seminal emission for medical reasons or in order to preserve the [human] race.","A person should direct his heart and the totality of his behavior to one goal, becoming aware of God, blessed be He.

"Mishneh Torah, Human Dispositions 3:3","A person who accustoms himself to live by [the rules of] medicine does not follow a proper path if his sole intention is that his entire body and limbs be healthy and that he have children who will do his work and toil for him. Rather, he should have the intent that his body be whole and strong, in order for his inner soul to be upright so that [it will be able] to know God. For it is impossible to understand and become knowledgeable in the wisdoms when one is starving or sick, or when one of his limbs pains him. [Similarly,] one should intend to have a son [with the hope that] perhaps he will be a wise and great man in Israel. Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God. Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He.

"Mishneh Torah, Sabbath 15:1","A person standing in a public domain may move [articles] throughout a private domain. Similarly, a person standing in a private domain may move [articles] within a public domain, provided he does not transfer them beyond four cubits. If he transfers an article [beyond that distance], he is not liable, because he is located in a different domain.

Similarly, a person standing in a private domain may move [articles] within a public domain, provided he does not transfer them beyond four cubits.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">In both these instances, there is not even a Rabbinic prohibition against moving the articles. As mentioned in the notes on the following halachah, Rashi and the Rashba state that this leniency applies only with regard to articles the person does not require in the domain in which he is standing. If he needs them, the Rabbis decreed that they may not be moved, lest the person forget and bring the articles into the domain where he is standing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 350:1) appears to favor the view of these authorities.</i> If he transfers an article [beyond that distance], he is not liable, because he is located in a different domain.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's decision, noting that <i>Eruvin</i> 99a would appear to hold a person liable in such a situation. The difficulty with the Rambam's statements is compounded by the fact that the passage cited above associates the law in question with the following decision, ""A person who carries an article from the beginning [of a square] four cubits long to the end [of that square] in the public domain is liable, even when he lifts it above his head."" Since the Rambam holds one liable in the latter instance (see Chapter 12, Halachah 14), it would seem that he would hold one liable with regard to the law under discussion. The Ra'avad's arguments are so powerful that the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> suggests amending the text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> accordingly.<br>The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1527) notes the Ra'avad's question, and states that he checked all the ancient manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> available to him, and they all state that the person is not liable. Therefore, he explains that a person is not liable for transfering an article unless he is standing in one of the domains involved in the transfer. This concept is derived from the transfer of the articles in the construction of the Sanctuary. In this instance, the people were not standing in a domain other than those involved in the transfer. Based on this foundation, he offers an interpretation - albeit a slightly strained one - for the passage in <i>Eruvin</i>.</i><br><br><br><br><img><br><br>A - A private domain where the person is standing<br><br>B - A public domain<br><br>C - The space through which the article is moved<br>(more than 4 cubits)<br><br>Similarly, a person standing in a private domain may open [a door with a key<sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">This and the following law refer to situations where the key is located in the domain where the door is located.</i>] in a public domain.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions the possibility of placing the key in the door as a forbidden transfer.

If there is even a small portion [of the wall] remaining on both sides of the opening, or if a portion [of the wall] four handbreadths in size remains on one side of the opening, it is permitted to carry in the entire courtyard.

Nevertheless, since this conduit is so wide, it is no longer considered part of the private domain.</i><br>What is the ruling regarding carrying in the courtyard as a whole?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">42</sup><i class=""footnote"">I.e., does the conduit nullify the courtyard's distinction as a private domain? Significantly, this question is asked in this halachah and not in the previous one. In the previous halachah, although the conduit itself was considered a separate domain, since the opening was less than ten handbreadths, it is considered as an entrance and the enclosure is not nullified. This halachah, however, mentions an opening of more than ten cubits, an aperture which ordinarily nullifies an enclosure.</i> If there is even a small portion [of the wall] remaining on both sides of the opening, or if a portion [of the wall] four handbreadths in size remains on one side of the opening, it is permitted to carry in the entire courtyard.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">43</sup><i class=""footnote"">Several explanations have been offered for the Rambam's ruling. Among them: the small portion of the wall which remains juts out over the water. Therefore, the opening to the courtyard is less than ten cubits (Rabbenu Yonason, commenting on Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi). The portions of the wall which remain on either side are considered like poles. As stated in Chapter 17, Halachah 7, it is permitted to carry in a courtyard with poles on either edges of the entrance to the fourth side (an ancient commentary on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from Egypt). See also the <i>Or Sameach</i>.</i> It is forbidden only to draw water from the conduit.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">44</sup><i class=""footnote"">For the reasons mentioned above, the wall of the courtyard is an acceptable divider, and thus the courtyard as a whole is still considered to be a private domain. Nevertheless, since the wall was not made for the purpose of distinguishing the water that is outside the courtyard from that which is within the courtyard, a separate partition is required for that purpose (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> If, however, no portion of the wall remains, it is forbidden to carry in the entire courtyard, for it has been opened up to the sea,<sup class=""footnote-marker"">45</sup><i class=""footnote"">When there are no portions jutting out over the water (according to the first interpretation in note 49) or when the entire wall is destroyed (according to the second), the courtyard is considered as enclosed on three sides alone and it is forbidden to carry within.</i> which is a <i>carmelit</i>.","

"Mishneh Torah, Sabbath 15:13","How must the partitions be erected in the water? If [the majority of the partition] is above the water, at least a handbreadth of the partition must descend into the water. If the partition as a whole descends into the water, at least a handbreadth must rise above the water level. [In this manner,] the water in the courtyard will be distinct, [from the water in the conduit on either side of the courtyard].     Although the partition does not reach the ground [in the conduit], since it is ten handbreadths high, it is permitted. The use of a partition that remains hanging was allowed only with regard to water.

"Mishneh Torah, Sabbath 15:16","We must not pour water into a courtyard that is less than four cubits by four cubits on the Sabbath, because [the water] will flow into the public domain rapidly.     Therefore, it is necessary to dig a pit that contains two  in the courtyard or in the public domain next to the courtyard, so that the water will collect there. [If the pit is within the public domain], one must build a domed covering over this pit from the outside so that the pit will not be seen in the public domain. The courtyard and the patio adjoining it are combined [when calculating] the four cubits. How large is a pit that contains two ?

Significantly, the Rashba accepts the more lenient view and, in this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 357:1) follows his ruling.</i> on the Sabbath, because [the water] will flow into the public domain rapidly.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">62</sup><i class=""footnote"">Pouring the water into the courtyard does not violate a Torah prohibition, because the courtyard itself is an extension of the home. Although the water flows into the public domain, this is due to the forces of gravity and inertia. Thus, the person's pouring of the water is considered as merely a cause; it is not considered as if he poured the water into the public domain directly. Nevertheless, the Rabbis forbade pouring the water in this manner.</i><br><br><br><img

"Mishneh Torah, Torah Study 3:13","Even though it is a mitzvah to study during the day and at night, it is only at night that a person acquires most of his wisdom. Therefore, a person who desires to merit the crown of Torah should be careful with all his nights, not giving up even one to sleep, eating, drinking, talk, or the like.

"Mishneh Torah, Festival Offering 1:1","The Jewish people have been commanded to observe three positive commandments on each of the three pilgrimage festivals. They are: a) to appear before the Divine presence, as Exodus 23:17 states: ""All of your males shall appear""; b) bringing a festive offering, as Deuteronomy 16:15 states: ""You shall bring a festive offering to God your Lord""; and c) celebration, as :14 states: ""And you shall rejoice in festivals."" The Torah's charge to appear before God mandates that one should appear in the Temple Courtyard on the first day of a festival and bring with him a burnt-offering, whether from fowl or from domesticated animals. One who comes to the Temple Courtyard on the first day of a festival without bringing a burnt-offering has not only failed to perform a positive commandment, but has violated a negative commandment, as Exodus 23:15 states: ""You shall not appear in My presence empty-handed."" One is not liable for lashes for the violation of this prohibition, because he did not perform a deed.
