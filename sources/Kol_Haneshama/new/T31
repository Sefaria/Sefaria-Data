/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. /ITHatefilah/XX, "The Prayer," is the central prayer of the worship
service. The language and manner of reciting the /ITTefilah/XX offer insights into
the place of the individual in communal prayer. When the /ITTefilah/XX is recited
privately, each individual stands (hence the name /ITAmidah/XX, "standing") and
addresses God in a sustained conversational way. Calling God "you" indi-
cates intimacy and immediacy. Nevertheless, the individual prays with the
communal voice: "We acknowledge you," "Bless us," "Grant us peace."
The Mishnah provides the structure within which additional prayers and
petitions are placed. Even an individualòs private needs have importance
within the communal context./PR

Throughout the centuries the pursuit of meaningful communal prayer has
led to variations in the /ITAmidah/XX. These variations reflect the attitudes and
beliefs of different prayer communities. In the ongoing pursuit of mean-
ingful prayer for a Reconstructionist prayer community, changes have been
introduced into this /ITAmidah/XX, most notably in the first two of the seven
/ITberah/±ot/XX which comprise the Shabbat /ITAmidah/XX. The first /ITberah/±ah/XX has been
expanded to include the matriarchs along with the patriarchs as exemplars
of Godòs presence in human lives. By concentrating on examples of heal-
ing forces and life-sustaining rains, the second /ITberah/±ah/XX acknowledges God
as the power that sustains life. The traditional emphasis on Godòs ability
to resurrect the dead has been replaced here by a celebration of God as the
power that sustains all life.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. A. J. Heschel has said, "The term, `God of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacobò is semantically different from a term such as `the God of truth,
goodness, and beauty.ò Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob do not signify ideas,
principles or abstract values. Nor do they stand for teachers or thinkers,
and the term is not to be understood like that of `the God of Kant, Hegel,
and Schelling.ò Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not principles to be compre-
hended but lives to be continued. The life of one who joins the covenant
of Abraham continues the life of Abraham, for the present is not apart
from the past. `Abraham is still standing before Godò (Genesis 18:22).
Abraham endures forever. We are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." In this same
spirit, we are also Sarah and Rebekah, Rachel and Leah.    /SC/XXL.W.K./XX/PR

ר ר / /ITezrat sarah/XX. The biblical term /ITezer/XX has two meanings, "rescue"
and "be strong." It is commonly translated as "aid" or "help." It also has
the sense of power and strength. In Deuteronomy 33:29, /ITezer/XX is parallel to
ו, majesty. Eve is described as Adamòs /ITezer kenegdo/XX, a power equal to him,
a strength and majesty to match his. Thus /ITmagen avraham/XX (shield of
Abraham) and /ITezrat sarah/XX (help of Sarah) are parallel images of power
and protection.    /SC/XXR.S.A./XX/PR

reflect their theological outlooks and ethical concerns. At any place where
a blessing occurs in the liturgy, the following elements can be combined
to create alternative formulas for /ITberah/±ot/XX. This can be done by selecting
one phrase from each group to form the introductory clause./PR

the inward flame of devotion that brings our prayer close to God. Indeed,
as the Hebrew phrasing vividly conveys, a passionate longing for godliness
can exist among those unable to express that feeling in words. The phrase
/ITlahav tefilatam/XX, "the flame of Israelòs prayer," recalls that feeling of
/IThitlahavut/XX: the "in-burning" flame of passionate devotion. To attain
/IThitlahavut/XX in prayer is to soar with the rapturous ecstasy of divine commu-
nion, to access the infinite and be aflame with the nearness of God./PR

is a need for daily wonder, there is a need for daily worship. The sense of
the "miracles which are daily with us," the sense of the "continual mar-

we take for granted the blessings or defeats of living...The profound and
