INTRODUCTIONThe Reconstructionist Press now proudly presents this nextvolume in the <i>Kol Haneshamah</i> series, <i>Shabbat Veḥagim</i>. Thisprayerbook has been profoundly influenced by the hundreds ofdetailed responses to the experimental <i>Erev Shabbat</i> siddur thatpreceded it. Together with the soon to be published dailyprayerbook, the forthcoming High Holiday prayerbook and thealready published <i>Shirim Uvraḥot</i>, this volume is part of thecomplete cycle of liturgy that comprises <i>Kol Haneshamah</i>. Whilethe <i>Kol Haneshamah</i> series strives to meet the needs ofcontemporary Jews, it stands in the tradition of earlierReconstructionist liturgy.When the Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation first publishedthe Sabbath Prayer Book in 1945, it was a revolutionary event.In fact, a picture of some rabbis who burned it as heresyappeared on the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>. That bookplays a critical part in the legacy of the first generation ofReconstructionists. It rests on four principles: reverence for thetraditional siddur; use of the vast literature of Judaism;cognizance of contemporary problems and aspirations; andcourage to produce new liturgy and edit the traditional liturgyin order to be true to contemporary Jewish sensibilities andmoral vision.The series of prayerbooks launched in 1945 deleted referencesto Jewish chosenness, to <i>Mashiaḥ ben David</i> (Messiah son ofDavid), to hope for the reinstitution of sacrifices, to individualreward and punishment, and to bodily resurrection. It assumedthat not every word of Scripture is factual and divinely ordained.Those prayerbooks, edited by Mordecai Kaplan, Eugene Kohn,Ira Eisenstein, Ludwig Nadelmann, Jack J. Cohen, and MiltonSteinberg, have provided an invaluable legacy to this generationof worshippers. The new prayerbook remains faithful to theseprinciples. In fact, they helped to inspire the currentgeneration's efforts by asserting that each generation should actin light of its own Jewish sensibilities, moral strivings,exploration of inherited tradition and spiritual search.The situation of North American Jewry has changed remarkablysince the 1940s. Then Jews were struggling to assimilate intoNorth American society. Today many North Americans aretrying to find their way into Judaism. In the 1940s the horrorof the Holocaust and the emergence of the State of Israel hadnot yet redefined the Jewish sense of self, and the ethnicawakening of Jews had not yet begun. The language of prayerhad not yet been affected by the growing informality ofAmerican manners. Changes in women's roles had not yet hada major influence. There was no way of anticipating the smallergroups that would join in prayer, the return to lay leadership inworship, and the growing desire for a sense of inclusion. Largecongregations have also been revitalized by these trends. Manyof the metaphors found in prayer were considered necessaryconventions by those who had grown up with them. Todaymany Jews prefer other metaphors.English usage, too, has changed considerably in the last fortyyears. Thus there was substantial agreement about the need tochange. That change was guided by the ReconstructionistPrayerbook Commission.The composition of the Prayerbook Commission is noteworthy.For the first time in Jewish history, the body overseeing thedevelopment of a Jewish prayerbook series contains a roughlyequal number of rabbis and laypeople, as well as equalinvolvement of men and women. The ReconstructionistRabbinical Association and the Federation of ReconstructionistCongregations and Havurot appointed Commission memberswith the intention of representing the diverse views andpractices of those who will use the new books. The livelydiscussions of the Commission often grew out of efforts tounderstand the differing sensibilities of its members and to makeroom for them within the prayerbooks while maintaining thecoherence of the prayerbooks as a unified liturgy.The broad acceptance of the experimental <i>Erev Shabbat</i> volume,in its third printing as this siddur is published, evidences thegrowing constituency comfortable with <i>Kol Haneshamah</i>'sapproach to liturgy. These are Jews who are finding their wayto fuller Jewish lives despite scanty Jewish educations and scarcememories of powerful experiences of worship and ritual. Theyare discovering for themselves the treasures of learning andaction, spiritual discipline and ritual in Judaism. Fears that moretraditional worship styles inevitably carry with them moretraditional theology have been put to rest.The members of the Editorial Committee worked individuallyon the areas assigned them, with the product of their effortscoming back to the Prayerbook Commission for comment. TheEditorial Committee has not only brought an extraordinaryarray of knowledge, skills and insights to bear on the project; ithas brought varied spiritual lives and personal tastes as well.Furthermore, its members have been tolerant of the PrayerbookCommission's need to retain editorial control. We have aimedto produce a book with a central core that unifies through styleand basic theological assumptions while allowing themulti-vocal nature of the collective enterprise of Jewish prayerto emerge. What that has meant in more specific terms can beillustrated by looking at the individual parts of theprayerbook.H<small>EBREW</small>. The new Hebrew text was shaped by severalinfluences: The Sephardic and Ashkenazic texts of KabbalatShabbat, the theological considerations that frameReconstructionism, and the recent additions to the service fromaround the world. Hebrew texts that were omitted fornon-theological reasons in the first Reconstructionist prayerbookhave been restored. Sections of the Song of Songs, traditionallyrecited on Friday evening, have been added to <i>Kabbalat Shabbat</i>,providing rich and vivid imagery. Several newly composed texts,including an additional version of the <i>Aleynu</i>, have been added.They respond to several needs: to include suitable references tothe Holocaust and the founding of the State of Israel, to furtherexplicate the movement's commitment to pluralism anduniversalism, and to respond to lessons learned from feminism.Some of these changes are subtle, and some add options. Theresult is Hebrew text suitable for use either by itself or inconjunction with English translation and readings. Where it istraditional for the cantor or service leader to begin chanting aprayer, an asterisk has been placed in the Hebrew text.T<small>RANSLITERATION</small>. Since a prayerbook is of little use if it is notaccessible, and since many who could grow into its use havevirtually no Hebrew language skills, transliteration has beenplaced adjacent to the Hebrew. All the parts of the service thatare frequently sung are transliterated. That is done as a bridgefor newcomers, encouraging their participation in worship. It ishoped that such participation will inspire people to learnHebrew for themselves: Full participation in Jewish culturerequires Hebrew literacy.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. A large number of those who will use the newprayerbook have little knowledge of the structure or history ofthe siddur. In many cases they have had little opportunity toexperience prayer as deeply moving and life-shaping. Thecommentary addresses that reality in several ways. It points outthe underlying structure of the liturgy. It notes places where thenew siddur differs from earlier prayerbooks and explains why. Itprovides contemporary interpretations and applications of thetraditional liturgy and explores the meaning of particular termsand literary forms. The commentary will help to open theprayerbook to people who might otherwise find communalworship alienating, or who find private prayerincomprehensible. It can help all of us to continue learningabout the liturgy.The explanations at the bottom of the page are divided into sixcategories: Comments beginning with <i>Hebrew words</i> explain themeaning of those words. <i>Notes</i> are short explanations.<i>Commentary</i> discusses liturgical structure, literary forms and themeaning of particular prayers. <i>Kavanot</i> and <i>Guided Meditations</i> areintended to shape the spiritual intention, the inner directionwith which prayers are spoken. <i>Derash</i> is a homiletical form thatmakes a moral point or provides a popular interpretation.T<small>RANSLATION</small>. Influenced by the power of the King Jamestranslation of the Bible and by a desire for grandeur and majestyin worship, prayerbook translations in English have had anarchaic flavor about them until quite recently. Moving toward acontemporary, vivid, yet elegant translation required the handof a poet steeped in Jewish tradition and American idiom.Dr. Joel Rosenberg's extraordinary efforts were complicated bythe decision to make the translation completely gender-neutral.This and similar problems were resolved by complexinterpretations weaving together the poetic, the theological, andthe midrashic. These sources provided the foundation fromwhich the new translation emerged.The most difficult translation issue is the question ofGod-language. The classical translation of the הוהי name of Godis Lord, a masculine noun that does not work because of itsgender. It does not work as living imagery. Furthermore, it isnot consistent with a theology that stresses God's immanence --God made manifest through human action, through nature, andthrough the workings of the human heart. After a careful reviewof the responses to the experimental <i>Erev Shabbat</i> book andlengthy discussion among members of the Commission, adecision was reached. Everywhere that the Tetragrammaton or<i>Adonay</i> appears in Hebrew, a descriptive name of God appears inhalf-caps in the English translation. Several reasons underlie thisdecision: It solves the problem that many people have in relatingto "Lord." It conveys some of the complexity and freshness ofJewish metaphors that refer to the divine. By explicating themany ways that God's presence is made manifest in Jewishliturgy, this mode of translation encourages every worshipper tobecome aware of the elements of the divine infused in all themany parts of our lives and our world. The use of these manymetaphors is also meant to suggest that no words are adequatefor naming or containing the divine. All the images togetherpoint to a reality beyond themselves.R<small>EADINGS</small>. The readings in the prayerbook are selected withattention to significant literary quality, to clarity andcomplexity, to their ability to evoke images and feelings, and totheir ability to remain meaningful with repeated use. Thereadings are not didactic; they are meant to help us discoverwhat is ready to be revealed within ourselves.Furthermore, the readings play an important role by providinga counterbalance to the Hebrew. Changing huge sections of theHebrew liturgy would sever our roots in traditional prayer. Somissing themes must find their place elsewhere, and theadditional readings are a natural place for them. For example,the voices of women emerge in the readings. That has not meantstrained jargon or a separatist viewpoint, but rather theexpression of hopes and perceptions that all can grow intosharing. This is a transitional time in the formation of prayercommunities. We affirm the need for continued change andrecognize that it will carry both the English and the Hebrew ofthe siddur far beyond what we in our lifetimes will witness. Still,we hope that some of what we have done will become a lastingpart of Jewish tradition.No prayerbook's readings can be expected to be comprehensive.They cannot reflect the continuously changing panoramaof world events, or reflect every mood, insight, or theologicalnuance. Congregations should seek out additional readings thatmeet the needs of the liturgical moment or speak strongly to aparticular congregation. Many of these prayers, which may workwonderfully once but not hold up to repeated use, should bemade available within the congregation in a nonpermanentformat. We hope that leaders will choose to use the readingshere often and still recognize that a continuous search forsupplemental sources will enrich the liturgical experience.S<small>ONGS</small>. For many, singing provides a sense of belonging andactive participation in public worship. Because of the size of thevolume, no musical notations have been included here. Formusical notation, see <i>Kol Haneshamah: Shirim Uvraḥot</i>, for whichthere is also an audio tape. In addition, audio tapes of the <i>nusaḥ</i>(music for chanting and singing the liturgy) are available for theentirety of this volume.M<small>EDITATIONS</small>. The guided meditations and <i>Shiviti</i> drawings aretools for inner exploration. Restoring silence and wordlessmelody to worship should enrich the prayer experience.D<small>ESIGN</small>. The design of this prayerbook highlights the meaningof the text and suggests fresh ways of thinking about it. Designshould enhance the text rather than compete with it. Most ofthe artwork in this siddur is calligraphic because representationalart has not been a frequently used Jewish form. While includingartwork in a siddur is uncommon, it reflects a deep commitmentto all aspects of Jewish civilization. That commitment has beenthe hallmark of the Reconstructionist movement.The overall appearance of a prayerbook contributes to theaesthetic experience. We have done our best to produce clean,spare pages. They are meant to be both highly readable andpleasing to the eye. In general, we have placed the Hebrew onthe left side of the page rather than on the customary right. Thisis done partly for aesthetic reasons and partly to allow thebeginnings of the lines to be near each other for those movingback and forth between Hebrew and English. We feel confidentthat once people move beyond their initial surprise, they willquickly feel comfortable with the layout.A U<small>SER'S </small>G<small>UIDE</small>. The design of this siddur makes it easy to use.Relatively inexperienced service leaders and <i>daveners</i> should findthat the rubrics guide them smoothly through such questions as:Where do I stand or sit? Where can I put extra readings? Whichthemes belong where? We hope that the siddur's rubrics willprovide a sufficient guide to use, but we recognize that local<i>minhagim</i> (customs) vary so widely that all of them could notpossibly be mentioned. We hope that differing local customswill continue to flourish.A C<small>OLLECTIVE </small>O<small>F </small>D<small>ISTINCTIVE </small>I<small>NDIVIDUALS</small>. By now it shouldbe clear that the commentators and editors who worked on thevarious sections of the prayerbook had different charges. Ibelieve that this process has produced a book in which manyvoices can be heard. No effort has been made to mute thedistinctiveness of those voices. The members of the choir,however, were selected with an ear to the range and timbre oftheir voices. The distinctiveness of the soloists at any momentis therefore compatible with the liturgical choir. It will be up toeach <i>sheliaḥ tzibur</i> (service leader) to decide which voices shouldbe heard on any given day. The wide range of choices shouldallow each congregation to use the new prayerbook in a waycontinuous with previous congregational practice. It is hopedthat the book will also stimulate congregations and minyanimto try new things, to stretch themselves a bit. The prayerbookwas never a homogenized entity. It always included the voicesof theists and panentheists, mystics and scholars, pietists andtraditionalists. That multi-vocality is just as present in our book.We hope that your voice, too, will be heard in the prayers thatfly off the new siddur's pages.K<small>OL </small>H<small>ANESHAMAH</small>. The name of this prayerbook series comesfrom Psalm 150--<i>Kol haneshamah tehalel Yah</i> that is oftentranslated, "Let every soul praise God." But <i>kol haneshamah</i>could also mean, "all the soul." Let it be the soul's voice thatoffers praise. These are our hopes for this book. Let everyonewho opens it find here the means to praise God. Let those whouse it regularly fill their souls with the divine. And let ustogether give voice to the divine in ways that transform us andour world.D<small>AVID </small>A.
