/KAPREFACE/XX/PR

This new siddur reflects the work of a dedicated group of editors
and Commission members, as well as thousands of thoughtful
responses to its predecessor /ITKol Haneshamah: Erev Shabbat/XX, by
Reconstructionist laypeople and rabbis. It draws upon the talents
of a myriad of nameless Jewish liturgists as well as many dozens
of poets and commentators. Joe Blair, Lillian Kaplan, David
Golomb, Allan Abrahams, David Steinberg and Shoshee Larkey
have helped with proofreading. Arthur Green has been an
invaluable advisor in forming the Hebrew text. Mel Scult has
provided comments from the published and unpublished writing
of Mordecai Kaplan. Seth Riemer has helped faithfully with
liturgical research, literary permissions, paste-ups and other
editorial tasks. Cantors David Tilman and Elizabeth Bolton have
guided my choices of /ITnusah/±/XX and /ITzemirot/XX. Ezra Spicehandler
graciously consulted regarding Hebrew poetry. Alvin
Schultzberg of The Town House Press has guided the bookòs
design, typesetting and printing. Deborah Brin and Lee
Friedlander have again served brilliantly in selecting readings.
Joel Rosenberg has brought his wondrous poetòs ear to the task
of translation. Betsy Platkin Teutsch has again enhanced the
book through her artistic vision. Reena Spicehandler has labored
diligently and good naturedly for years in developing the bookòs
manuscript. Mordechai Liebling has managed the finances and
distribution of the volume./PR
