/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The three blessings on pages 162, 166, and 168 constitute
a meditation on body, soul and intellect. The first blessing reflects the
intricate workings of our physiology. We recognize the wondrous system
of arteries, organs and glands that comprise the "human machine." We
then celebrate the purity of the soul that is implanted within us, we feel
the "wind-spirit" of our own breath, our /ITanima/XX filled with air. As we
breathe, all the systems of our bodies are also filled with life-sustaining
oxygen. Finally, we rejoice in our intellects--in our ability to study and
grapple with words of Torah, to reflect on them and our capacity to teach
them to future generations.    /SC/XXL.B./XX/PR

הרות ירבדב קסעל / to occupy ourselves with words of Torah. The Hebrew
words here do not say "to study Torah," but rather to "be engaged" or "to
be busy with" the study of Torah. We study Torah not as an intellectual
exercise alone. Rather, we understand our "engagement" with Torah more
holistically--as an every day, every moment activity. We also understand
that to be fully "engaged" with Torah is to wrestle with Torah--to chal-
lenge our tradition while loving it, to question while celebrating it.    /SC/XXL.B./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Blessings and texts for Torah study are a traditional part of
/ITBirh/±ot Hashah/±ar/XX. Like body and soul, Torah study is a daily part of Jewish
living. Rabbinic literature records more than a half dozen versions of
Torah blessings. The ornate Torah blessing in our text (pages 169-171)
both begins and ends with the formula "/ITBaruh/± atah/XX." In the first instance,
the formula of the blessing acknowledges that Torah study is essential to
Jewish life. The concluding phrase of blessing praises God as the teacher
of Torah. From a Reconstructionist perspective, the metaphor of God as
teacher is an invitation and challenge to discern the divine presence in
learning. A talmudic passage appears between the two blessings. It offers
the hope that we, the people Israel, will always see Torah as an intrinsic
part of ourselves.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. We must study the Torah with a view toward discerning the great
traits of Jewish consciousness that struggled to become articulate in its tra-
ditions, laws, prophecies, psalms and wisdom. We should study all of its
traditions with the purpose of finding out their bearing on Israelòs destiny
and duty in the world and then seek to make that destiny and duty our

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. When we recite the Kaddish Derabanan, we are thankful for the
teachings of Torah (in its widest sense). We have received from those who
have come before us--and we accept our own place as links in the chain
of tradition. Every student becomes a teacher--what we have learned we
will teach. We celebrate our sense of accomplishment, our feeling that we
have gained richness from our study--and we re-affirm with this Kaddish,
the honorable endeavor in which we have been engaged. We are a people
of study and learning, teaching and receiving--/ITthis/XX is critical to our collec-
tive Jewish life.    /SC/XXL.B./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Most scholars agree that Kaddish Derabanan is the most
ancient form of the Kaddish prayer. It was used at the conclusion of study
long before the Kaddish became a prayer for mourners. Its prayer is that
the efforts of both students and teachers bring holiness and a sense of the
divine presence into the world. This in turn should help them formulate
a vison of peace that they can spread to all Israel, and ultimately to all the
world. Kaddish Derabanan, like all forms of the Kaddish, thus brings us
in touch with the central purpose of prayer.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR
