BIRḤOT HASHAḤAR/MORNING BLESSINGS/HN/KABIRKAT LIMUD TORAH /BLESSING PRECEDING TORAH STUDYThe following blessing is said only when it precedes Jewish study. Some appropriate studytexts can be found on pages 694-703. Any other Jewish sources may of course be selected.Blessed are you, THE ONE OF SINAI, our God, the sovereign ofall worlds, who made us holy with your mitzvot, andcommanded us to occupy ourselves with words of Torah./PIC<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The three blessings on pages 162, 166, and 168 constitutea meditation on body, soul and intellect. The first blessing reflects theintricate workings of our physiology. We recognize the wondrous systemof arteries, organs and glands that comprise the "human machine." Wethen celebrate the purity of the soul that is implanted within us, we feelthe "wind-spirit" of our own breath, our <i>anima</i> filled with air. As webreathe, all the systems of our bodies are also filled with life-sustainingoxygen. Finally, we rejoice in our intellects--in our ability to study andgrapple with words of Torah, to reflect on them and our capacity to teachthem to future generations.

Any other Jewish sources may of course be selected.ּבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יהוה אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ ֽֽֽמֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם אֲשֶׁר קִדְּֽֽֽשָׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו וְצִֽֽֽוָּנוּלַּעֲסֹק בְּדִבְרֵי תוֹרָה:PּH/HNBaruḥ atah adonay elo<u>hey</u>nu <u>me</u>leḥ ha'olam asher kide<u>sha</u>nubemitzvotav vetzi<u>va</u>nu la'asok bedivrey torah./PIהרות ירבדב קסעל / to occupy ourselves with words of Torah. The Hebrewwords here do not say "to study Torah," but rather to "be engaged" or "tobe busy with" the study of Torah. We study Torah not as an intellectualexercise alone. Rather, we understand our "engagement" with Torah moreholistically--as an every day, every moment activity. We also understandthat to be fully "engaged" with Torah is to wrestle with Torah--to chal-lenge our tradition while loving it, to question while celebrating it.    L.B.Transmit to us, WISE ONE, our God, your Torah's words, intoour mouths, and to the mouths of all the House of Israel, whocalled you kin. May we, and our children, and all the childrenof your people, the House of Israel, all of us, be knowers of yourName and learners of your Torah, for its sake alone. Blessed areyou, THE SAGE, who teaches Torah to your people Israel.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Blessings and texts for Torah study are a traditional part of<i>Birḥot Hashaḥar</i>. Like body and soul, Torah study is a daily part of Jewishliving. Rabbinic literature records more than a half dozen versions ofTorah blessings. The ornate Torah blessing in our text (pages 169-171)both begins and ends with the formula "<i>Baruḥ atah</i>." In the first instance,the formula of the blessing acknowledges that Torah study is essential toJewish life. The concluding phrase of blessing praises God as the teacherof Torah. From a Reconstructionist perspective, the metaphor of God asteacher is an invitation and challenge to discern the divine presence inlearning. A talmudic passage appears between the two blessings. It offersthe hope that we, the people Israel, will always see Torah as an intrinsicpart of ourselves.

We must study the Torah with a view toward discerning the greattraits of Jewish consciousness that struggled to become articulate in its tra-ditions, laws, prophecies, psalms and wisdom. We should study all of itstraditions with the purpose of finding out their bearing on Israel's destinyand duty in the world and then seek to make that destiny and duty ourown.    M.M.K. (ADAPTED)/KAKADDISH DERABANAN / THE SAGES' KADDISH<i>Reader:</i> Let God's name be made great and holy in the world thatwas created as God willed. May God complete the holy realmin your own lifetime, in your days, and in the days of all thehouse of Israel, quickly and soon. And say: Amen.<i>Congregation:</i> May God's great name be blessed, forever and as longas worlds endure.<i>Reader:</i> May it be blessed, and praised, and glorified, and held inhonor, viewed with awe, embellished and revered; and may theblessed name of holiness be hailed, though it be higher (OnShabbat Shuvah, add: by far) than all the blessings, songs, praises, andconsolations that we utter in this world. And say; Amen.For Israel and her sages, for their pupils and all pupils of theirpupils, and for all who occupy themselves with Torah, whetherin this place or any other place, may God grant them and youabundant peace, and grace, and love, and mercy, and long life,and ample sustenance, and saving acts, all flowing from divineabundance in the worlds beyond. And say: Amen.May heaven grant a universal peace and life for us and for allIsrael. And say: Amen.May the one who creates harmony above make peace for us, andfor all Israel, and for all who dwell on earth. And say: Amen.D<small>ERASH</small>. When we recite the Kaddish Derabanan, we are thankful for theteachings of Torah (in its widest sense). We have received from those whohave come before us--and we accept our own place as links in the chainof tradition. Every student becomes a teacher--what we have learned wewill teach. We celebrate our sense of accomplishment, our feeling that wehave gained richness from our study--and we re-affirm with this Kaddish,the honorable endeavor in which we have been engaged. We are a peopleof study and learning, teaching and receiving--<i>this</i> is critical to our collec-tive Jewish life.

M.M.K.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Most scholars agree that Kaddish Derabanan is the mostancient form of the Kaddish prayer. It was used at the conclusion of studylong before the Kaddish became a prayer for mourners. Its prayer is thatthe efforts of both students and teachers bring holiness and a sense of thedivine presence into the world. This in turn should help them formulatea vison of peace that they can spread to all Israel, and ultimately to all theworld. Kaddish Derabanan, like all forms of the Kaddish, thus brings usin touch with the central purpose of prayer.    D.A.T.A psalm. A song for dedication of the house.

Can it declare your truth?Hear, O HIDDEN ONE, deal graciously with me,S<small>UPERNAL </small>A<small>DVOCATE</small>, become a help for me!"You changed my mourning to an ecstatic dance,you loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with joy,that glory might sing out to you, and not be still!To you, my God, I always shall give thanks.Psalm 30/HYמִּזְמוֹר שִׁיר-חֲנֻכַּת הַֽֽֽבַּיִת לְדָוִד:אֲּרוֹמִמְךָ יהוה כִּי דִלִּיֽֽֽתָנִי וְלֹא-שִֽֽֽׂמַּחְתָּ אֹיְבַי לִי:יּהוה אֱלֹהָי שִֽֽֽׁוַּעְתִּי אֵֽֽֽלֶיךָ וַתִּרְפָּֽֽֽאֵנִי:יּהוה הֶעֱֽֽֽלִיתָ מִן-שְׁאוֹל נַפְשִׁי חִיִּיֽֽֽתַנִי מִֽֽֽיָּרְדִי-בוֹר:זַּמְּרוּ לַיהוה חֲסִידָיו וְהוֹדוּ לְֽֽֽזֵכֶר קָדְשׁוֹ:ּכִּי ֽֽֽרֶגַע בְּאַפּוֹ חַיִּים בִּרְצוֹנוֹ בָּֽֽֽעֶרֶב יָלִין ֽֽֽבֶּכִי וְלַֽֽֽבֹּקֶר רִנָּה:וַּאֲנִי אָֽֽֽמַרְתִּי בְשַׁלְוִי בַּל-אֶמּוֹט לְעוֹלָם:יּהוה בִּרְצוֹנְךָ הֶעֱֽֽֽמַדְתָּה לְהַרְרִי עֹז הִסְֽֽֽתַּרְתָּ פָֽֽֽנֶיךָ ֽֽֽהָיִיתִי נִבְהָל:אֵּֽֽֽלֶיךָ יהוה אֶקְרָא וְאֶל-אֲדֹנָי אֶתְחַנָּן:מַּה-ֽֽֽבֶּצַע בְּדָמִי בְּרִדְתִּי ֽֽֽאֶל ֽֽֽשָׁחַת הֲיוֹדְךָ עָפָר הֲיַגִּיד אֲמִֽֽֽתֶּךָ:שְּׁמַע-יהוה וְחָֽֽֽנֵּנִי יהוה הֱיֵה-עֹזֵר לִי:הָּֽֽֽפַכְתָּ מִסְפְּדִי לְמָחוֹל לִי פִּֽֽֽתַּחְתָּ שַׂקִּי וַתְּאַזְּֽֽֽרֵנִי שִׂמְחָה:*ּלְֽֽֽמַעַן יְזַמֶּרְךָ כָבוֹד וְלֹא יִדֹּם יהוה אֱלֹהַי לְעוֹלָם אוֹֽֽֽדֶךִָ:/HNE<u>le</u>ḥa adonay ekra ve'el adonay et-ḥanan.Shema adonay veḥo<u>ne</u>ni adonay heyey ozer li.K<small>AVANAH</small>. Focus on one of the psalms, one image, one verse or one word.Savor it. Let its fullness move you. Move at your own speed, easing yourselfinto the psalmist's vision. Let it become yours.    L.W.K.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The phrases of the psalms are applicable to people in manylife situations. If one image in a psalm does not speak to us, it is likelythat it speaks to someone else in the congregation with whom we pray.<small>H.L.</small>
