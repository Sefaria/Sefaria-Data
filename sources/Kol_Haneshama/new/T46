The Sabbath expresses for modern Jews, as it did for their
ancestors, the thought that the world is so constituted that we
can achieve salvation if, by adhering to valid ideals, we put
ourselves in contact with the creative forces that shape life and
make it worth living. Since we identify God with that aspect of
reality which gives to life its supreme value or holiness, this is
but another way of saying in more traditional language that the
Sabbath expresses for us the faith that humanity can achieve
salvation by cleaving to God, the Source of salvation./PR

/PR

But the Sabbath is not only a symbol of the salvation to be
achieved by communion with God. It is itself an instrument that
we may employ to advantage in our pursuit of salvation. We
need perhaps more than ever before to terminate each week with
a day that shall stimulate our thirst for salvation and keep us
faithful to the ideals that lead to its attainment. Otherwise our
mere preoccupation with the business of "making a living," that
is, of securing the conditions indispensable to life, tends to
absorb all our attention, and life itself becomes empty and
meaningless. We work to keep alive that we may work to keep
alive, until our powers are spent in this weary treadmill, and
death brings surcease of labor. If life is to be lived zestfully, and
to employ all those human faculties the full exercise of which
calls forth true joy in being alive, we dare not permit life to sink
to such a level of mere preoccupation with the problem of
survival. The Sabbath, with its insistence upon interrupting the
routine of our daily business and concerning ourselves with
spiritual values, helps to save us from such a fate./PR

Prayer requires no consecrated edifice and no appointed hour.
Indeed it needs no words or forms fixed and eternal. Prayer is
a step on which we rise from the self we are to the self we wish
to be. Prayer is not an escape from duty. It is no substitute for
the deed. Prayer seeks the power to do wisely, to act generously,
to live helpfully. Prayer takes us beyond the self. Joining our
little self to the selfhood of humanity, it gives our wishes the
freedom to grow large and broad and inclusive. Our prayers are
answered not when we are given what we ask, but when we are
challenged to be what we can be./PR

Morris Adler (adapted)/XX/PR

/PR

A long time ago, before anything had a name, we didnòt know
that we were man or woman, human or animal, male or female.
When the wild reeds bowed their heads in the wind, we bowed
our heads too, for it was the same spirit--breath that breathed
through us every second, every hour, every day of our lives. At
dawn when the brilliant orange squash blossoms opened gently,
gently at the first warm kiss of sun, we too opened our eyes and
uncurled from sleep, stretching wide, stretching far, rejoicing as
every part of our bodies came to life again. And when the rains
came forth, loving Earth so much that she grew fruits and
berries and nuts to feed us with, we were full of her joy and we
loved each other and we grew our own children to eat Earthòs
joys, her fruits, so that the rains would come again and visit her./PR

/PR

It was before we were called man or woman, even before we
could speak one word. In those days we prayed with our entire
beings, in the wind, in the sun, in the rain; every second, every
day, every hour of our lives; at the rising of the sun and the dark
of the moon, at the birth of the son and the death of the
grandmother, at the wedding of two lovers, at the buzzing of
the Spring. We breathed, we bowed, we laughed, we wept. This
was before we called it prayer./PR

Sanskrit Proverb/XX/PR

/PR

Strange is our situation here upon earth. Each of us comes for a
short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to divine
a purpose. From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is
one thing we do know: that we are here for the sake of each
other, above all, for those upon whose smile and well-being our
own happiness depends, and also for the countless unknown
souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy.
Many times a day I realize how much my own outer and inner
life is built upon the labors of others, both living and dead, and
how earnestly I must exert myself in order to give in return as
much as I have received and am still receiving./PR

Albert Einstein (adapted)/XX/PR

Prayer is not a stratagem for occasional use, a refuge to resort to
now and then. It is rather like an established residence for the
innermost self. All things have a home, the bird has a nest, the
fox has a hole, the bee has a hive. A soul without prayer is a
soul without a home. Weary, sobbing, the soul, after roaming
through a world festered with aimlessness, falsehoods and
absurdities, seeks a moment in which to gather up its scattered
life, in which to divest itself of enforced pretensions and
camouflage, in which to simplify complexities, in which to call
for help without being a coward. Such a home is prayer.
Continuity, permanence, intimacy, authenticity, earnestness are
its attributes. For the soul, home is where prayer is./PR

/PR

In her cottage, even the poorest person may bid defiance to
misery and malice. That cottage may be frail, its roof may shake,
the wind may blow through it, the storms may enter it, but there
is where the soul expects to be understood. Just as the body, so
is the soul in need of a home./PR

/PR

Everybody must build his own home; everybody must guard the
independence and the privacy of her prayers. It is the source of
security for the integrity of conscience, for whatever inkling we
attain of eternity. At home I have a parent who judges and cares,
who has regard for people, and when I fail and go astray, misses
me. I will never give up my home./PR

/PR

What is a soul without prayer? A soul runaway or a soul evicted
from its own home. To those who have abandoned their home,
the road may be hard and dark and far, yet do not be afraid to
steer back. If you prize grace and eternal meaning, you will
discover them upon arrival./PI/PR

/PL745/XX/PR

How marvelous is my home. I enter as a supplicant and emerge
as a witness; I enter as a stranger and emerge as next of kin. I
may enter spiritually shapeless, inwardly disfigured, and emerge
wholly changed. It is in moments of prayer that my image is
forged, that my striving is fashioned. To understand the world
I must love my home. It is difficult to perceive luminosity
anywhere if there is no light in my own home. It is in the light
of prayeròs radiance that I find my way even in the dark. It is
prayer that illumines my way. As my prayers, so is my
understanding./PR
