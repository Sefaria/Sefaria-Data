Atzeret / Simh/±at Torah, H/±anukah and the first two days of Pesah/±. It is recited in a
somewhat shortened form (half Hallel) on Rosh H/±odesh and the last six days of Pesah/±.
When Hallel is recited on Sukkot (except on Shabbat) the /MDlulav/XX and the /MDetrog/XX are held.

Blessed are you, /SCR/XXEDEEMING /XXO/XXNE/XX, our God, the sovereign of all
worlds, who has made us holy with your commandments, and
commanded us to recite the Hallel./PI/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Hallel, meaning "praise," consists of six ancient prayer--
poems, Psalms 113-118, which have been used in Jewish worship since
antiquity. Joyous melodies for the chanting of these songs highlight the
theme of deliverance. They are enclosed by two blessings that signify our
intention to praise God. Hallel is chanted on the joyous pilgrimage festi-
vals, of Pesah/±, Shavuot, and Sukkot, on H/±anukah and on Rosh H/±odesh,
the minor holiday of the New Moon. Since the founding of the State of
Israel, Hallel has also been recited on Israelòs Independence Day. The joy-
ous mood of Hallel is considered inappropriate for Rosh Hashanah and
Yom Kippur, with their awesome themes. On Purim, the reading of the
Megillah is thought to take the place of Hallel.    /SC/XXH.L./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. More than any other series of Jewish prayers, chanting the
Hallel psalms marks the cycles of the Jewish year. We sing Hallel at each
new moon (when the Jewish month begins), and on each day of the three
pilgrimage festivals. Just as the singing of Hallel reminds us of the inevita-
ble return of joyous times, so does its theme of one "delivered from the
ropes of death" (Psalm 116) or released "from my distress" (Psalm 118)
remind us even when we are in the midst of pain, sorrow, and despair that
joyous moments will surely return.    /SC/XXR.S./XX/PR

Psalm 114/XX/PR

/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. Why does Hallel contain psalms written both in the first person
singular and in the plural? To help us keep alive both a personal relation-
ship to God and a collective one. We cannot legitimately say, "We praise
you," unless each of us is included in the we. Otherwise, the ritual of
collective praise becomes an empty formality, not a true expression of
community.    /SC/XXH.L./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This psalm juxtaposes two crossings of water--that of the
Reed Sea and, forty years later, of the Jordan. The repetition of the final
miracle of the Exodus at the time of the initial entry to Canaan connects
those two events and suggests that the second is the fulfillment of the
first.    /SC/XXH.L./XX/PR

םב / Their preoccupations. Many translators have followed earlier
commentators in rendering םב as their "fingers." The goal of these
commentators was to emphasize the foolishness of idolators. A careful
grammatical examination of the text indicates that while the traditional
translation may have been emotionally satisfying to downtrodden genera-
tions, its exaggerated emphasis on the worthlessness of idols does not exist
in the original text. Preoccupation with "silver and gold" still prevents
many of us from keeping in sight the sources of transcendent value in our
lives.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. According to legend it was on the second day after going forth
from Egypt that the Israelites crossed the sea in triumph and the Egyptians
drowned. The midrash says that when the angels celebrated this victory,
God cried out, "My children have drowned in the sea!" Throughout our
history, Jews have shortened Hallel on the last six days of Pesah/± as a
reminder that our joy must be dimmed in the face of any sorrow--even
the losses of our enemies.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

ם  / They have a mouth...This passage calls to mind others in Scrip-
ture, such as Deuteronomy 4:28, Psalm 135:15-18, and Isaiah 44:9-20,
that debunk idolatry as the worship of inanimate objects. The verses here
remarkably establish an equivalence between the idol itself, its maker, and
its worshipper: all three are "lifeless," in body or in spirit. Only worship
of the Creator of all life can put us in touch with the mystery of life, thus
enabling us to sense and to affirm our aliveness.    /SC/XXJ.R./XX/PR

Psalm 115:12-19/XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This psalm calls on Israel, the House of Aaron, and those
"who fear" to trust in God. The psalmist looks forward to Godòs blessing
flowing upon those same three groups of people. Rashi comments that
"all who fear /SCT/XXHE /XXM/XXIGHTY /XXO/XXNE/XX" indicates the converts who have chosen
Judaism. Franz Rosenzweig interprets Psalm 115 as a comment on all peo-
ple who trust in God and keep up a never-ending song of praise. This
psalm, claims Rosenzweig, expresses our hope for a world redeemed from
division.    /SC/XXH.L./XX/PR

Psalm 118:1-4/XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. It is striking that the shortest psalm in the Book of Psalms
is also the most universal. Jewish universalism is rooted, the psalm testifies,
in Jewish particularism. Because we know God through the divine rela-
tionship to the people Israel, we urge all other nations to come to a similar
awareness of God. We urge them to do what we do in Hallel, to praise
the Eternal.    /SC/XXH.L./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. From my distress, I cried out: "Yah!" The divine name
"Yah," a shortened form of the name YHWH, occurs frequently in bibli-
cal poetry, and, unlike the unvocalized Tetragrammaton (whose pronunci-
ation is considered taboo), is pronounced as written. It also appears in the
common psalmodic exclamation "Halleluyah!" (literally, "Praise Yah!")
and is frequently an element in Hebrew personal names--for example, Isa-
iah (Hebrew /ITYishayahu/XX, "Yahòs help"), Uriah ("Yahòs light"), Nehemiah
("Yahòs consolation").    /SC/XXJ.R./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. -ר  ו / Open to me, O you gateways of justice.
These words suggest several different meanings. Open up the gates of
righteousness /ITfor/XX me--either because I am one of the righteous and deserve
to gain entrance or because I hope to receive charity through the right-
eousness of others. Or perhaps, "open up the gates of righteousness /ITto/XX me,"
that I too may learn to open up my heart, thus becoming one of the
righteous./PR

/PR

The welcoming gesture of opening the gates leads to greater justice in our
world. Those who pass through the gates of righteousness and open them
to others enter Godòs gateway to sing Yahòs praises among a community
of the righteous.    /SC/XXR.S./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. /ITRosh pinah/XX not only refers to the cornerstone but to the
keystone. The psalmist is pointing out that we must see that every nation,
every person has a place among Godòs wonders. It was a common occur-
rence for the workers building a wall to reject a stone for the foundation
because its sides were not straight. The architect would know that among
these rejects with slanted sides could be found one perfectly shaped to be
the exalted central stone of the arch.    /SC/XXE.M./XX/PR

your help / I pray, /SCA/XXBUNDANT /XXO/XXNE/XX, help us prevail" does not correspond
with the jubilance of the victory parade dramatized in this psalm. The rest
of the psalm is rich with praise; only here do we find the urgency and terse-
ness of petition. This petition reveals the essence of a relationship with
God. Just as Godòs mitzvot speak to us in the imperative, "Do this...donòt
do this," so we acknowledge the closeness of our relationship by also
speaking to God in the imperative: "Send us...help us." If we cannot speak
of our most basic needs in prayer, when can we speak of them?    /SC/XXH.L./XX/PR
