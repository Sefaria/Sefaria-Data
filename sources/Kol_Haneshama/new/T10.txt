BIRḤOT HASHAḤAR/MORNING BLESSINGS/HN/KABIRḤOT HASHAḤAR / MORNING BLESSINGSBlessed are you, AWAKENER, our God, life of all the worlds, whoremoves sleep from my eyes, and slumber from my eyelids./PIC<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Various editions of the prayerbook offer different orders ofthe morning blessings. Here the first blessing is that on awakening. Thencomes a blessing on the first sounds of dawn, followed by thanksgivingfor the return of waking consciousness ("who establishes the dry land uponthe waters"), and then the blessing on opening our eyes and seeing ourworld, freshly created with the dawn, around us. The cycle is completedwith the final blessing "who gives strength to the weary" as we prepareto begin our day.    A.G.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. This sequence of blessings is the central portion of BirḥotHashaḥar. It was designed by the talmudic sages to celebrate such acts ofawakening as focusing the eyes, sitting up, stretching, standing, etc. Thetransference of these blessings to the public worship service (ninth cen-tury) disengaged the blessing and the particular act of awakening withwhich it was joined. In their public setting the morning blessings took ona new level of meaning. Removed from the acts of awakening, individualactivities became metaphors for godly action. The blessing "who clothesthe naked" ceased to be a pointed acknowledgment of personal possessionsand personal protection. Instead it became a celebration of God as thepower that prompts the care and nurturance of humankind. The blessing"who raises the lowly" ceased to be a blessing over the renewal of physicalmobility and became a blessing of the divine presence manifest in actionsthat raise the bodies and elevate the spirits of those who are low.    S.S./HY/CA/בִרְכוֹת הַשַּׁחַרּבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יהוה אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ חֵי הָעוֹלָמִיםהַּמַּעֲבִיר שֵׁנָה מֵעֵינַי וּתְנוּמָה מֵעַפְעַפָּי:PּH/HNBaruḥ atah adonay elo<u>hey</u>nu ḥey ha'olamimhama'avir shenah me'eynay utnumah me'afapayC<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The familiar introductory formula for blessings includingthe phrase <i>meleḥ ha'olam</i> / sovereign of the world, was adopted by the rab-bis during the talmudic era and universally accepted by later Jews. Substi-tuting another rabbinic phrase, <i>ḥey ha'olamim</i> / life of all the worlds,expresses the idea that as Judaism continues to evolve, alternatives to theancient metaphor of God as divine ruler should emerge. This alternativeblessing formulation may be used throughout the siddur by those who pre-fer it, just as the traditional <i>meleḥ ha'olam</i> may be substituted here.    A.G.D<small>ERASH</small>. The "worlds" to which <i>ḥey ha'olamim</i> refers may be the manyuniverses that each of us inhabits, the vast spaces that surround our world,or the infinite depths that fill the human heart. We proclaim that God isthe single flow of life that inhabits and unifies them all.    A.G.Blessed are you, THE PROVIDENT, our God, life of all the worlds,who gives the bird of dawn discernment to tell day fromnight.Blessed are you, THE FASHIONER, our God, life of all the worlds,who stretches forth the earth upon the waters./PIK<small>AVANAH</small>. We give thanks that we are restored whole and healthy to con-sciousness and to an orderly universe. That is why, in the second blessing,we give thanks that, when we stepped out of bed our feet encountered notthe watery chaos which preceded creation, but the solid earth which Godspread over the waters. The daily emergence from unconsciousnessreminds us of our fragility as human creatures and our need for supportand care.    R.A.D<small>ERASH</small>. For whom do we recite blessings? If God is beyond blessing, thenwe must be reciting them for ourselves. Each <i>beraḥah</i> urges us to avoidtaking the world for granted. Each contains a vision of the creative orredemptive power in the world. Jewish tradition teaches that living up toour heritage as beings created <i>betzelem elohim</i>, in the image of God, requiresus to "imitate God." Thus each <i>beraḥah</i> can teach us something about liv-ing our lives in consonance with the divine. Blessings tell us not so muchabout a God "out there somewhere," they teach us how to make manifestthe godly in ourselves.

In an urban setting, the earliest soundof life we are likely to hear at dawn is the chirping of sparrows. <i>Seḥvi</i> isthus rendered differently from <i>gever</i>, rooster, here to capture some of theambiguity of the word.    J.R.Blessed are you, THE LAMP, our God, life of all the worlds, whomakes the blind to see.Blessed are you, THE COMPASSIONATE, our God, life of all theworlds, who clothes the naked.Blessed are you, REDEEMING ONE, our God, life of all theworlds, who makes the captive free.Blessed are you, THE HELPING HAND, our God, life of all theworlds, who raises up the humble./PIK<small>AVANAH</small>. Those of us who live in plenty are grateful for the clothing onour bodies, the warmth of a garment that shields us from the elements.We pray for a time when this blessing may be spoken by <i>all</i> people, a timewhen <i>all</i> humans are "clothed" with warmth and safety, enwrapped inGod's love.    L.B.םיפופכ ףקוז / who raises up the humble: literally makes upright those bentdown. The phrase could suggest either those suffering a physical deformityor those humbled by adverse circumstances.

An interpretivetranslation of Psalm 37:23-24: "When one's steps follow the divine path,they bring delight along the way." The Baal Shem Tov noted in this con-nection that wherever one goes and whatever one does each day shouldhave a deeper spiritual significance that parallels the mundane reality ofeveryday existence. In bringing to our lives this deeper significance, wefind new delight in the firmness of our steps.

Once we are awake, we return to full consciousness of whowe are. In the rigidly stratified society in which these prayers originated,people were less conscious of identity than of status. Thus, the originalforms of these prayers expressed the thankfulness of the most privilegedmembers of the community--free Jewish males--that they did not havethe less privileged status of women, slaves, or non-Jews.The blessings we now use affirm that since we embody the divine image,we are all intrinsically valuable. To degrade or enslave others is to defacethe image of God. We were created free just as our creator is free. We arecapable of choice, of invention and of transformation in our lives and inour world. We also give thanks for our particular identity as Jews. Godwho creates our common humanity, also cherishes human diversity. Eachpeople is unique and precious.    R.A./HYּבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יהוה אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ חֵי הָעוֹלָמִיםשֶּׁעָֽֽֽשַׂנִי בְּצַלְמוֹ:ּבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יהוה אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ חֵי הָעוֹלָמִיםשֶּׁעָֽֽֽשַׂנִי בֶּן  ּבַּת חוֹרִין:ּבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יהוה אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ חֵי הָעוֹלָמִיםשֶׁעָֽֽֽשַׂנִי יִשְׂרָאֵל:ּבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יהוה אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ חֵי הָעוֹלָמִיםהַּנּוֹתֵן לַיָּעֵף ֽֽֽכֹּחַ:PּH/HNBaruḥ atah adonay elo<u>hey</u>nu ḥey ha'olamimshe'a<u>sa</u>ni betzalmo.Baruḥ atah adonay elo<u>hey</u>nu ḥey ha'olamimshe'a<u>sa</u>ni ben/bat ḥorin.Baruḥ atah adonay elo<u>hey</u>nu ḥey ha'olamimshe'a<u>sa</u>ni yisra'el.Baruḥ atah adonay elo<u>hey</u>nu ḥey ha'olamimhanoten laya'ef <u>ko'</u>aḥ.N<small>OTE</small>. "T<small>HE </small>I<small>MAGELESS</small>...who made me in your image." This paradoxicalrendering enables us to understand that our being made "in the divineimage" (Genesis 1:26-27) encompasses other than physical attributes:speech, will, reason, spirituality, kindness, freedom of action, moralsense.    J.R.ומלצב ינשעש / who made me in your image. When a human being is slain,the very image of God is shattered. We revere human life because it is aspark of the life that animates the universe. Only after we have acquiredthe principle of reverence for each person is it possible to love each otheras we should love, not merely "as thyself" but as a reflection of the divine."Beloved are human beings," said R. Akiba, "for they were made in theimage of God."    M.M.K. (ADAPTED)Blessed are you, THE ARCHITECT, our God, the sovereign of allworlds, who shaped the human being with wisdom, making forus all the openings and vessels of the body. It is revealed andknown before your Throne of Glory that if one of thesepassage-ways be open when it should be closed, or blocked upwhen it should be free, one could not stay alive or stand beforeyou. Blessed are you, MIRACULOUS, the wondrous healer of allflesh.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. This blessing expresses wonder at the simple but necessaryfunctioning of the human body. We do not need to stand before anygreater wonder of nature than our own bodies in order to appreciate theintricacy and beauty with which our world is endowed. A sense of awe atour own creation is a starting point of prayer.    A.G./HYּבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יהוה אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ ֽֽֽמֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם אֲשֶׁר יָצַר אֶת הָאָדָם בְּחָכְמָהּוּבָרָא בוֹ נְקָבִים נְקָבִים חֲלוּלִים חֲלוּלִים:ּגָּלוּי וְיָֽֽֽדוּעַ לִפְנֵי כִסֵּא כְבוֹֽֽֽדֶךָ שֶׁאִם יִפָּֽֽֽתֵחַ אֶחָד מֵהֶם אוֹ יִסָּתֵם אֶחָדמֵּהֶם אִי אֶפְשָׁר לְהִתְקַיֵּם וְלַעֲמֹד לְפָֽֽֽנֶיךָ:ּבָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יהוה רוֹפֵא כָל בָּשָׂר וּמַפְלִיא לַעֲשׂוֹת:/HNBaruḥ atah adonay elo<u>hey</u>nu <u>mel</u>eḥ ha'olam asher yatzar etha'adam beḥoḥmah uvara vo nekavim nekavim ḥalulim ḥalulim.Galuwi veya<u>du</u>'a lifney ḥisey ḥevo<u>de</u>ḥa she'im yipa<u>te</u>'aḥ eḥadmehem o yisatem eḥad mehem i efshar lehitkayem vela'amodlefa<u>ne</u>ḥa.

We regularly perceive by contrast: light andshadow, height and depth, loudness and softness...Often we become awareof health only after illness has replaced it. This brief paragraph of praisefor the wondrous workings of the human organism encourages recognitionof the blessing of health in its presence, not its absence. Every momentwe are healing!    E.G.My God, the soul you gave to me is pure. You have created it,you shaped it, and you breathed it into me, and you preserve itdeep inside of me. And someday you will take it from me,restoring it to everlasting life./PIC<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The word <i>neshamah</i>, which means both "breath" and"soul," provides a linguistic connection between the blessings for body andsoul. The blessing for the soul uses the vocabulary of the Creation story,especially Genesis 2:6, which describes how God created the human formand then animated it with the breath of life. Hence, the language of cele-brating each awakening carries an echo of the primal joining of humanform to life force. Every awakening is nothing less than a rehearsal of themystery of creation.The traditional version of the blessing for the soul acknowledges the dailyrenewal of life as a recollection of creation and also as a foretaste of resur-rection. The current version concludes instead by acknowledging God asthe power that renews life each day.    S.S.D<small>ERASH</small>. This short and beautiful prayer starts each day and offers comfortin times of stress. Self-esteem is a precious gift. Even though we may loseit in the tragedies of the present, it will be restored to us in our future.God, the healer, returns our souls to us.    E.M./HYאֱּלֹהָי נְשָׁמָה שֶׁנָּֽֽֽתַתָּ בִּי טְהוֹרָה הִיא:אַּתָּה בְרָאתָהּ, אַתָּה יְצַרְתָּהּ אַתָּה נְפַחְתָּהּ בִּי וְאַתָּה מְשַׁמְּרָהּ בְּקִרְבִּיוְּאַתָּה עָתִיד לִטְּלָהּ מִֽֽֽמֶּנִּי לְחַיֵּי עוֹלָם:PּH/HNElohay neshamah shena<u>ta</u>ta bi tehorah hi.םלוע ייחל / restoring [the soul] to everlasting life. The traditional Hebrewtext says, "and restore it to me in the future to come." The text in oursiddur, rather than stressing the traditional notion of individual afterlife,or of personal resurrection in the messianic End of Days, reverses theemphasis: the soul, having sojourned in the physical life, is restored to theeverlasting stream of life--to the continuum of being that is the sum-totalof all transitory lives, when viewed from the perspective of eternity.    J.R.G<small>UIDED </small>M<small>EDITATION</small>. In the Hebrew of המשנ יהלא / My God, the soul,many of the words end with the sound "ah," spelled "הָ". When this prayeris chanted slowly, you breathe these words. Thus this prayer suggests anopportunity, through breathing, to explore the connection between<i>neshamah</i> as breath and as soul:Sit comfortably with your eyes closed, feet uncrossed, and hands looselyon your lap. Take a series of slow, relaxed breaths. Don't try to controlthem. Just let them come and go freely. Focus your concentration on yourbreath. Let the thoughts you have flow through you. Don't try to controlthem. Each time you end a thought, return your focus to your breath. Dothis for several minutes. As you follow your breath, reflect on the divineenergy it contains.    L.W.K./D.B.As long as spirit breathes in me, I offer thanks before you,B<small>REATH </small>D<small>IVINE</small>, my God, God of my ancestors, the master ofall deeds, and source of every life. Blessed are you, THE HOLYSPIRIT, in whose possession is the breath of every living thing,the animation of all flesh.K<small>AVANAH</small>. We are each created in the image of God. When we allow thereflections of our own beings to illuminate the universe, when we under-stand that we carry God <i>within us</i>, we are closer to doing the work thatwill eventually perfect the world. When we each accept the purity of ourown souls and the purity of the souls of others, <i>tikun olam</i> will have beenachieved.    L.B.K<small>AVANAH</small>. "Sleep is one sixtieth a part of death (Talmud Beraḥot 57b),"and waking is a kind of rebirth.    L.W.K./HYּכָּל זְמַן שֶׁהַנְּשָׁמָה בְקִרְבִּי מוֹדֶה  ּמוֹדָה אֲנִי לְפָֽֽֽנֶיךָ יהוה אֱלֹהַי וֵאלֹהֵיאֲּבוֹתַי וְאִמּוֹתַי רִבּוֹן כָּל הַמַּעֲשִׂים אֲדוֹן כָּל הַנְּשָׁמוֹת: בָּרוּךְ אַתָּהיּהוה אֲשֶׁר בְּיָדוֹ ֽֽֽנֶפֶשׁ כָּל חָי וְֽֽֽרוּחַ כָּל בָּשָׂר:/HNיח לכ שפנ ודיב רשא / in whose possession is the breath of every living thing.We gratefully acknowledge God as the source of life itself and of the con-stant renewal of our spirit. The traditional formula of this blessing, refer-ring to the future resurrection of the dead, has been emended. As Recon-structionists, we accept both the finality of death and the infinitewondrousness of life. Our religion is about the balancing of these two real-ities, neither of which may be allowed to negate the other.    A.G.
