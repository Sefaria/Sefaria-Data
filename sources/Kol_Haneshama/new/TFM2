The Reconstructionist Press now proudly presents this next
volume in the /ITKol Haneshamah/XX series, /ITShabbat Veh/±agim/XX. This
prayerbook has been profoundly influenced by the hundreds of
detailed responses to the experimental /ITErev Shabbat/XX siddur that
preceded it. Together with the soon to be published daily
prayerbook, the forthcoming High Holiday prayerbook and the
already published /ITShirim Uvrah/±ot/XX, this volume is part of the
complete cycle of liturgy that comprises /ITKol Haneshamah/XX. While
the /ITKol Haneshamah/XX series strives to meet the needs of
contemporary Jews, it stands in the tradition of earlier
Reconstructionist liturgy./PR

/PR

When the Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation first published
the Sabbath Prayer Book in 1945, it was a revolutionary event.
In fact, a picture of some rabbis who burned it as heresy
appeared on the front page of the /ITNew York Times/XX. That book
plays a critical part in the legacy of the first generation of
Reconstructionists. It rests on four principles: reverence for the
traditional siddur; use of the vast literature of Judaism;
cognizance of contemporary problems and aspirations; and
courage to produce new liturgy and edit the traditional liturgy
in order to be true to contemporary Jewish sensibilities and
moral vision./PR

/PR

The series of prayerbooks launched in 1945 deleted references
to Jewish chosenness, to /ITMashiah/± ben David/XX (Messiah son of
David), to hope for the reinstitution of sacrifices, to individual
reward and punishment, and to bodily resurrection. It assumed
that not every word of Scripture is factual and divinely ordained.
Those prayerbooks, edited by Mordecai Kaplan, Eugene Kohn,
Ira Eisenstein, Ludwig Nadelmann, Jack J. Cohen, and Milton
Steinberg, have provided an invaluable legacy to this generation
of worshippers. The new prayerbook remains faithful to these
principles. In fact, they helped to inspire the current
/PR

/PR

/PLxix/XXINTRODUCTION/XX/PR

generationòs efforts by asserting that each generation should act
in light of its own Jewish sensibilities, moral strivings,
exploration of inherited tradition and spiritual search./PR

/PR

The situation of North American Jewry has changed remarkably
since the 1940s. Then Jews were struggling to assimilate into
North American society. Today many North Americans are
trying to find their way into Judaism. In the 1940s the horror
of the Holocaust and the emergence of the State of Israel had
not yet redefined the Jewish sense of self, and the ethnic
awakening of Jews had not yet begun. The language of prayer
had not yet been affected by the growing informality of
American manners. Changes in womenòs roles had not yet had
a major influence. There was no way of anticipating the smaller
groups that would join in prayer, the return to lay leadership in
worship, and the growing desire for a sense of inclusion. Large
congregations have also been revitalized by these trends. Many
of the metaphors found in prayer were considered necessary
conventions by those who had grown up with them. Today
many Jews prefer other metaphors./PR

/PR

English usage, too, has changed considerably in the last forty
years. Thus there was substantial agreement about the need to
change. That change was guided by the Reconstructionist
Prayerbook Commission./PR

/PR

The composition of the Prayerbook Commission is noteworthy.
For the first time in Jewish history, the body overseeing the
development of a Jewish prayerbook series contains a roughly
equal number of rabbis and laypeople, as well as equal
involvement of men and women. The Reconstructionist
Rabbinical Association and the Federation of Reconstructionist
Congregations and Havurot appointed Commission members
with the intention of representing the diverse views and
practices of those who will use the new books. The lively
discussions of the Commission often grew out of efforts to
/PR

/PR

/PR

/PGINTRODUCTION/XXxx/XX/PR

understand the differing sensibilities of its members and to make
room for them within the prayerbooks while maintaining the
coherence of the prayerbooks as a unified liturgy./PR

/PR

The broad acceptance of the experimental /ITErev Shabbat/XX volume,
in its third printing as this siddur is published, evidences the
growing constituency comfortable with /ITKol Haneshamah/XXòs
approach to liturgy. These are Jews who are finding their way
to fuller Jewish lives despite scanty Jewish educations and scarce
memories of powerful experiences of worship and ritual. They
are discovering for themselves the treasures of learning and
action, spiritual discipline and ritual in Judaism. Fears that more
traditional worship styles inevitably carry with them more
traditional theology have been put to rest./PR

/PR

The members of the Editorial Committee worked individually
on the areas assigned them, with the product of their efforts
coming back to the Prayerbook Commission for comment. The
Editorial Committee has not only brought an extraordinary
array of knowledge, skills and insights to bear on the project; it
has brought varied spiritual lives and personal tastes as well.
Furthermore, its members have been tolerant of the Prayerbook
Commissionòs need to retain editorial control. We have aimed
to produce a book with a central core that unifies through style
and basic theological assumptions while allowing the
multi-vocal nature of the collective enterprise of Jewish prayer
to emerge. What that has meant in more specific terms can be
illustrated by looking at the individual parts of the
prayerbook./PR

/PR

/SCH/XXEBREW/XX. The new Hebrew text was shaped by several
influences: The Sephardic and Ashkenazic texts of /ITKabbalat
Shabbat/XX, the theological considerations that frame
Reconstructionism, and the recent additions to the service from
around the world. Hebrew texts that were omitted for
non-theological reasons in the first Reconstructionist prayerbook
/PR

/PLxxi/XXINTRODUCTION/XX/PR

have been restored. Sections of the Song of Songs, traditionally
recited on Friday evening, have been added to /ITKabbalat Shabbat/XX,
providing rich and vivid imagery. Several newly composed texts,
including an additional version of the /ITAleynu/XX, have been added.
They respond to several needs: to include suitable references to
the Holocaust and the founding of the State of Israel, to further
explicate the movementòs commitment to pluralism and
universalism, and to respond to lessons learned from feminism.
Some of these changes are subtle, and some add options. The
result is Hebrew text suitable for use either by itself or in
conjunction with English translation and readings. Where it is
traditional for the cantor or service leader to begin chanting a
prayer, an asterisk has been placed in the Hebrew text./PR

/PR

/SCT/XXRANSLITERATION/XX. Since a prayerbook is of little use if it is not
accessible, and since many who could grow into its use have
virtually no Hebrew language skills, transliteration has been
placed adjacent to the Hebrew. All the parts of the service that
are frequently sung are transliterated. That is done as a bridge
for newcomers, encouraging their participation in worship. It is
hoped that such participation will inspire people to learn
Hebrew for themselves: Full participation in Jewish culture
requires Hebrew literacy./PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. A large number of those who will use the new
prayerbook have little knowledge of the structure or history of
the siddur. In many cases they have had little opportunity to
experience prayer as deeply moving and life-shaping. The
commentary addresses that reality in several ways. It points out
the underlying structure of the liturgy. It notes places where the
new siddur differs from earlier prayerbooks and explains why. It
provides contemporary interpretations and applications of the
traditional liturgy and explores the meaning of particular terms
and literary forms. The commentary will help to open the
prayerbook to people who might otherwise find communal
worship alienating, or who find private prayer
/PR

/PGINTRODUCTION/XXxxii/XX/PR

incomprehensible. It can help all of us to continue learning
about the liturgy./PR

/PR

The explanations at the bottom of the page are divided into six
categories: Comments beginning with /ITHebrew words/XX explain the
meaning of those words. /ITNotes/XX are short explanations.
/ITCommentary/XX discusses liturgical structure, literary forms and the
meaning of particular prayers. /ITKavanot/XX and /ITGuided Meditations/XX are
intended to shape the spiritual intention, the inner direction
with which prayers are spoken. /ITDerash/XX is a homiletical form that
makes a moral point or provides a popular interpretation./PR

/PR

/SCT/XXRANSLATION/XX. Influenced by the power of the King James
translation of the Bible and by a desire for grandeur and majesty
in worship, prayerbook translations in English have had an
archaic flavor about them until quite recently. Moving toward a
contemporary, vivid, yet elegant translation required the hand
of a poet steeped in Jewish tradition and American idiom.
Dr. Joel Rosenbergòs extraordinary efforts were complicated by
the decision to make the translation completely gender-neutral.
This and similar problems were resolved by complex
interpretations weaving together the poetic, the theological, and
the midrashic. These sources provided the foundation from
which the new translation emerged./PR

/PR

The most difficult translation issue is the question of
God-language. The classical translation of the ו name of God
is Lord, a masculine noun that does not work because of its
gender. It does not work as living imagery. Furthermore, it is
not consistent with a theology that stresses Godòs immanence --
God made manifest through human action, through nature, and
through the workings of the human heart. After a careful review
of the responses to the experimental /ITErev Shabbat/XX book and
lengthy discussion among members of the Commission, a
decision was reached. Everywhere that the Tetragrammaton or
/ITAdonay/XX appears in Hebrew, a descriptive name of God appears in
/PR

/PLxxiii/XXINTRODUCTION/XX/PR

half-caps in the English translation. Several reasons underlie this
decision: It solves the problem that many people have in relating
to "Lord." It conveys some of the complexity and freshness of
Jewish metaphors that refer to the divine. By explicating the
many ways that Godòs presence is made manifest in Jewish
liturgy, this mode of translation encourages every worshipper to
become aware of the elements of the divine infused in all the
many parts of our lives and our world. The use of these many
metaphors is also meant to suggest that no words are adequate
for naming or containing the divine. All the images together
point to a reality beyond themselves./PR

/PR

/SCR/XXEADINGS/XX. The readings in the prayerbook are selected with
attention to significant literary quality, to clarity and
complexity, to their ability to evoke images and feelings, and to
their ability to remain meaningful with repeated use. The
readings are not didactic; they are meant to help us discover
what is ready to be revealed within ourselves./PR

/PR

Furthermore, the readings play an important role by providing
a counterbalance to the Hebrew. Changing huge sections of the
Hebrew liturgy would sever our roots in traditional prayer. So
missing themes must find their place elsewhere, and the
additional readings are a natural place for them. For example,
the voices of women emerge in the readings. That has not meant
strained jargon or a separatist viewpoint, but rather the
expression of hopes and perceptions that all can grow into
sharing. This is a transitional time in the formation of prayer
communities. We affirm the need for continued change and
recognize that it will carry both the English and the Hebrew of
the siddur far beyond what we in our lifetimes will witness. Still,
we hope that some of what we have done will become a lasting
part of Jewish tradition./PR

/PR

No prayerbookòs readings can be expected to be comprehensive.
They cannot reflect the continuously changing panorama
/PR

/PGINTRODUCTION/XXxxiv/XX/PR

of world events, or reflect every mood, insight, or theological
nuance. Congregations should seek out additional readings that
meet the needs of the liturgical moment or speak strongly to a
particular congregation. Many of these prayers, which may work
wonderfully once but not hold up to repeated use, should be
made available within the congregation in a nonpermanent
format. We hope that leaders will choose to use the readings
here often and still recognize that a continuous search for
supplemental sources will enrich the liturgical experience./PR

/PR

/SCS/XXONGS/XX. For many, singing provides a sense of belonging and
active participation in public worship. Because of the size of the
volume, no musical notations have been included here. For
musical notation, see /ITKol Haneshamah: Shirim Uvrah/±ot/XX, for which
there is also an audio tape. In addition, audio tapes of the /ITnusah/±/XX
(music for chanting and singing the liturgy) are available for the
entirety of this volume./PR

/PR

/SCM/XXEDITATIONS/XX. The guided meditations and /ITShiviti/XX drawings are
tools for inner exploration. Restoring silence and wordless
melody to worship should enrich the prayer experience./PR

/PR

/SCD/XXESIGN/XX. The design of this prayerbook highlights the meaning
of the text and suggests fresh ways of thinking about it. Design
should enhance the text rather than compete with it. Most of
the artwork in this siddur is calligraphic because representational
art has not been a frequently used Jewish form. While including
artwork in a siddur is uncommon, it reflects a deep commitment
to all aspects of Jewish civilization. That commitment has been
the hallmark of the Reconstructionist movement./PR

/PR

The overall appearance of a prayerbook contributes to the
aesthetic experience. We have done our best to produce clean,
spare pages. They are meant to be both highly readable and
pleasing to the eye. In general, we have placed the Hebrew on
the left side of the page rather than on the customary right. This
is done partly for aesthetic reasons and partly to allow the
/PR

/PLxxv/XXINTRODUCTION/XX/PR

beginnings of the lines to be near each other for those moving
back and forth between Hebrew and English. We feel confident
that once people move beyond their initial surprise, they will
quickly feel comfortable with the layout./PR

/PR

/SCA U/XXSERòS /XXG/XXUIDE/XX. The design of this siddur makes it easy to use.
Relatively inexperienced service leaders and /ITdaveners/XX should find
that the rubrics guide them smoothly through such questions as:
Where do I stand or sit? Where can I put extra readings? Which
themes belong where? We hope that the sidduròs rubrics will
provide a sufficient guide to use, but we recognize that local
/ITminhagim/XX (customs) vary so widely that all of them could not
possibly be mentioned. We hope that differing local customs
will continue to flourish./PR

/PR

/SCA C/XXOLLECTIVE /XXO/XXF /XXD/XXISTINCTIVE /XXI/XXNDIVIDUALS/XX. By now it should
be clear that the commentators and editors who worked on the
various sections of the prayerbook had different charges. I
believe that this process has produced a book in which many
voices can be heard. No effort has been made to mute the
distinctiveness of those voices. The members of the choir,
however, were selected with an ear to the range and timbre of
their voices. The distinctiveness of the soloists at any moment
is therefore compatible with the liturgical choir. It will be up to
each /ITsheliah/± tzibur/XX (service leader) to decide which voices should
be heard on any given day. The wide range of choices should
allow each congregation to use the new prayerbook in a way
continuous with previous congregational practice. It is hoped
that the book will also stimulate congregations and minyanim
to try new things, to stretch themselves a bit. The prayerbook
was never a homogenized entity. It always included the voices
of theists and panentheists, mystics and scholars, pietists and
traditionalists. That multi-vocality is just as present in our book.
We hope that your voice, too, will be heard in the prayers that
fly off the new sidduròs pages./PR

/SCK/XXOL /XXH/XXANESHAMAH/XX. The name of this prayerbook series comes
from Psalm 150--/ITKol haneshamah tehalel Yah/XX that is often
translated, "Let every soul praise God." But /ITkol haneshamah/XX
could also mean, "all the soul." Let it be the soulòs voice that
offers praise. These are our hopes for this book. Let everyone
who opens it find here the means to praise God. Let those who
use it regularly fill their souls with the divine. And let us
together give voice to the divine in ways that transform us and
our world./PR
