PESUKEY DEZIMRAH/VERSES OF PRAISE/HNA psalm of David, when he changed his appearance feigningmadness before the Philistine king Avimeleḥ, who sent himon his way.A blessing shall I speak for THE ALMIGHTY, at all times,always is God's praise upon my mouth.By THE INCOMPARABLE shall my soul celebrate,and may the humble hear it and rejoice.Give greatness to THE ONE along with me,and let us elevate the divine name in unison.Deeply have I searched for THE INEFFABLE,and in all my trials, God has rescued me.Have eyes turned toward God and be enlightened!Oh, let not your faces darken in confusion!Zero this person had, but when he called, GOD listened,and in all his troubles, he was helped!He had an angel of THE ONE stationed around him,as around all those who fear GOD and are freed.Taste then, and see how good THE FOUNT can be,how happy is the person who finds refuge there.You holy beings, have awe of THE DIVINEthere is no lack for those who tremble at it.Cubs of the lion are at times in need and hungry,but those who ask of GOD shall never lack the good.Listen children, hear me out,an awe for THE MYSTERIOUS I'll teach to you.Might there be a person who wants life,who desires days of seeking good?Never let your tongue speak evil,nor your lips pronounce deceit!Swerve away from evil, perform good,seek peace, and follow after it./PI/HYלְּדָוִד בְּשַׁנּוֹתוֹ אֶת-טַעְמוֹ לִפְנֵי אֲבִיֽֽֽמֶלֶךְ וַיְגָרֲֽֽֽשֵׁהוּ וַיֵּלַךְ:	ּאֲבָרֲכָה אֶת-יהוה בְּכָל-עֵת	תָּמִיד תְּהִלָּתוֹ בְּפִי:	ּבַּיהוה תִּתְהַלֵּל נַפְשִׁי	יִשְׁמְעוּ עֲנָוִים וְיִשְֽֽֽׂמָחוּ:	ּגַּדְּלוּ לַיהוה אִתִּי	וּנְרוֹמְמָה שְׁמוֹ יַחְדָּו:	ּדָּֽֽֽרַשְׁתִּי אֶת-יהוה וְעָֽֽֽנָנִי	וּמִכָּל-מְגוּרוֹתַי הִצִּיֽֽֽלָנִי:	ּהִֽֽֽבִּיטוּ אֵלָיו וְנָֽֽֽהָרוּ	וּפְנֵכֶם אַל-יֶחְֽֽֽפָּרוּ:	ּזֶה עָנִי קָרָא וַיהוה שָֽֽֽׁמֵעַ	וּמִכָּל-צָרוֹתָיו הוֹֽֽֽשִׁיעוֹ:	ּחֹנֶה מַלְאַךְ-יהוה	סָבִיב לִירֵאָיו וַיְחַלְּצֵם:	ּטַעֲמוּ וּרְאוּ כִּי-טוֹב יהוה	אַשְׁרֵי הַֽֽֽגֶּבֶר יֶחֱסֶה-בּוֹ:	ּיְראוּ אֶת יהוה קְדֹשָיו	כִּי-אֵין מַחְסוֹר לִירֵאָיו:	ּכְּפִירִים רָשׁוּ וְרָֽֽֽעֵבוּ	וְדֹרְשֵׁי יהוה לֹא-יַחְסְרוּכָל-טוֹב:	ּלְכוּ-בָנִים שִׁמְעוּ-לִי	יִרְאַת יהוה אֲלַמֶּדְכֶם:	ּמִי-הָאִישׁ הֵחָפֵץ חַיִּים	אֹהֵב יָמִים לִרְאוֹת טוֹב:	ּנְצֹר לְשׁוֹנְךָ מֵרָע	וּשְׂפָֽֽֽתֶיךָ מִדַּבֵּר מִרְמָה:	ּסוּר מֵרָע וַעֲשֵׂה-טוֹב	בַּקֵּשׁ שָׁלוֹם וְרָדְֽֽֽפֵהוּ:PּH/HNMi ha'ish heḥafetz ḥayim ohev yamim lirot tov.Netzor leshoneḥa mera usfa<u>te</u>ḥa midaber mirmah.Sur mera va'asey tov bakesh shalom verod<u>fe</u>hu.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Rabbi Kaplan used to say that we can only know Godthrough the direct experience of the world. He would then cite the verse,óה בוט יכ וארו ומעט / Taste then and see how good THE FOUNT can be (Psalm34:9). Buber made the same point when he said, "One who truly goes outto meet the world goes out also to God" (I and Thou).    M.S.N<small>OTE</small>. "He" has been used in the translation of several verses in this psalmbecause they refer specifically to King David.    R.S.Eyes of THE ONE look toward the righteous,divine ears are trained upon their cry.Present is GOD when evildoers act,to ban them from the land of memory,Z<small>ION'S </small>G<small>OD</small> will listen when you cryand from all your troubles God will save.Quite near is THE OASIS to the broken-hearted,and the despairing it will help.Righteous one may be, with many troubles,but from all of them THE LIVING WATERS save.Showing care down to a person's bones,God will not let a single one of them be broken.The wicked ones will perish in their evil,haters of the righteous will be summoned to account.Powerful redeemer is THE ONE to those who serve,all who trust in THE ETERNAL triumph over guilt.Psalm 34C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. This psalm is an alphabetical acrostic. The English equiva-lents of the initial letters are based on the Hebrew, rather than the English,alphabet. The Tetragrammaton appears in this psalm, as in Psalm 29,eighteen times, the numerical equivalent of life.    J.R./HY	ּעֵינֵי יהוה אֶל-צַדִּיקִים	וְאָזְנָיו אֶל-שַׁוְעָתָם:	ּפְּנֵי יהוה בְּעֹשֵׂי רָע	לְהַכְרִית מֵֽֽֽאֶרֶץ זִכְרָם:	ּצָעֲקוּ וַיהוה שָֽֽֽׁמֵעַ	וּמִכָּל-צָרוֹתָם הִצִּילָם:	ּקָרוֹב יהוה לְנִשְׁבְּרֵי-לֵב	וְאֶת-דַּכְּאֵי-ֽֽֽרוּחַ יוֹֽֽֽשִׁיעַ:	ּרַבּוֹת רָעוֹת צַדִּיק	וּמִכֻּלָּם יַצִּיֽֽֽלֵנוּ יהוה:	ּשֹׁמֵר כָּל-עַצְמוֹתָיו	אַחַת מֵֽֽֽהֵנֶּה לֹא נִשְֽֽֽׁבָּרָה:	ּתְּמוֹתֵת רָשָׁע רָעָה	וְשֹנְאֵי צַדִּיק יֶאְֽֽֽשָׁמוּ:	ּ*פֹּדֶה יהוה ֽֽֽנֶפֶשׁ עֲבָדָיו	וְלֹא יֶאְשְׁמוּ כָּל-הַחוֹסִים בּוֹ:/HNC<small>OMMENTARY</small>. "Will be summoned to account"..."triumph over guilt"---the Hebrew verb is the same in both verses: <i>yeshamu...lo ye<u>she</i>mu</u>. Therendering of these phrases is meant to capture the paradoxical theologicaland psychological implications of guilt: considered as a condition ofresponsibility before God, the concept of guilt is an important cornerstoneof religious belief; considered as an emotion that can, sometimes inappro-priately, lead a person into despair or self-hatred, a sense of guilt can some-times be dangerous and wrong. Those who "triumph over" guilt masterthe crippling effects of guilt as an emotion; they will, however, retain theirsense of right and wrong, and continue to hold themselves responsiblebefore God.    J.R.A prayer of Moses, the man of God.My protector, you are our abode,one generation to the next,since before the mountains came to birth,before the birthpangs of the land and world.From eternity unto eternity, you are divine.You return a person unto dust.You say: Return, oh children of humanity!Truly, a thousand years are in your eyeslike yesterday--so quickly does it pass--or like the watchman's nighttime post.You pour upon them sleep, they sleep.When morning comes, it vanishes like chaff.At dawn, life blossoms and renews itself,at dusk, it withers and dries up.Truly, we are consumed amid your anger,and amid your wrath are made to tremble./PIC<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Psalm 90 could be called a wisdom psalm. Its message isthat the very eternity of God forces us to confront the shortness of humanlife and our own mortality. The psalmist calls out for the wisdom "to assessour days" and thus to gain an understanding heart. Facing mortalitysquarely and honestly, the psalmist, with great poignancy, calls out for asmany joyous days as those we have experienced suffering and pain. Thehuman capacity to arise from suffering and experience joy again is one ofthe greatest testimonies to God's presence.

Psalm 90. םיהלאה שיא השׁמל הליפת / A prayer of Moses, the man ofGod--A number of psalms are traditionally ascribed to authors other thanDavid. This is the only one ascribed to Moses. The identification may reston the psalmist's extreme humility before God, the psalm's desertlikemood, its stress on the nothingness of humanity and nature, and its plead-ing on behalf of human beings in the face of divine wrath.    J.R.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. ובוש רמאתו / אכד דע שונא בשׁת / You return a person unto dust.You say: Return...--This couplet captures, with some irony, twovalues of the word "return": physical return of the human being to dustis suggested first, and the line that follows could allude to it, as well; orGod's call could mean, "Repent, do <i>teshuvah</i>!" When the word appearsagain, some verses later, its meaning is deepened further: "Return, FOUN-TAIN OF LIGHT!"--here, the prayer calls upon God to return from hidingor from anger, and be reconciled with humanity. Human and divine repen-tance mirror each other. The psalmist prays for this mutual return.<small>J.R.</small>You have placed our sins before your presence,our hidden faults into the lamplight of your face.Yes, all our days are emptied in your fire,our years are finished off as but a murmur.Years of our lifetime are but seventy--perhaps, among the strongest, eighty years--and most of them are toil and fatigue,then quickly it all ends, we fly away.Who knows the full strength of your fury?Is our fear of you the equal of your wrath?Oh, let us know how to assess our days,how we may bring the heart some wisdom.Return, FOUNTAIN OF LIGHT! How long?Be reconciled with your servants!Give us, at daybreak, the plenty of your love,enable us to dance and to rejoice throughout our days.Regale us for as many days as you have tortured us,as many years as we have witnessed evil.Let your accomplishments be visible to those who serve you,let your beauty rest upon their children,let our divine protector's pleasure be upon us,and the labor of our hands, make it secure,the labor of our hands ensure!Psalm 90/HY	ּֽֽֽשַׁתָּה עֲוֹנֹֽֽֽתֵינוּ לְנֶגְֽֽֽדֶּךָ	עֲלֻֽֽֽמֵנוּ לִמְאוֹר פָּֽֽֽנֶיךָ:	ּכִּי כָל-יָֽֽֽמֵינוּ פָּנוּ בְעֶבְרָֽֽֽתֶךָ	כִּֽֽֽלִּינוּ שָֽֽֽׁנֵינוּ כְּמוֹ-ֽֽֽהֶגֶה:	ּיְמֵי-שְׁנוֹֽֽֽתֵינוּ בָּהֶם שִׁבְעִים שָׁנָה וְאִם בִּגְבוּרֹת שְׁמוֹנִים שָׁנָה:	ּוְרָהְבָּם עָמָל וָֽֽֽאֶוָן	כִּי-גָז חִישׁ וַנָּֽֽֽעֻפָה:	ּמִי-יוֹֽֽֽדֵעַ עֹז אַֽֽֽפֶּךָ	וּכְיִרְאָתְךָ עֶבְרָֽֽֽתֶךָ:	ּלִמְנוֹת יָֽֽֽמֵינוּ כֵּן הוֹדַע	וְנָבִיא לְבַב חָכְמָה:	ּֽֽֽשׁוּבָה יהוה עַד-מָתָי	וְהִנָּחֵם עַל-עֲבָֽֽֽדֶיךָ:	ּשַׂבְּֽֽֽעֵנוּ בַֽֽֽבֹּקֶר חַסְֽֽֽדֶּךָ	וּנְרַנְּנָה וְנִשְׂמְחָה בְּכָל-יָֽֽֽמֵינוּ:	ּשַׂמְּֽֽֽחֵנוּ כִּימוֹת עִנִּיֽֽֽתָנוּ	שְׁנוֹת רָֽֽֽאִינוּ רָעָה:	יֵרָאֶה אֶל-עֲבָֽֽֽדֶיךָ פָעָֽֽֽלֶךָ	וַהֲדָרְךָ עַל-/בְנֵיהֶם:	ּ*וִיהִי ֽֽֽנֹעַם אֲדֹנָי אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ עָֽֽֽלֵינוּ	וּמַעֲשֶׂה יָֽֽֽדֵינוּ כּוֹנְנָה עָֽֽֽלֵינוּ	ּוּמַעֲשֵׂה יָֽֽֽדֵינוּ כּוֹֽֽֽנְנֵהוּ:PּH/HNDwelling in the secret of the Highest,in the shade of the Almighty does one lodge.I say to THE ETERNAL ONE: My roof, my fortress tower,my God, in whom I trust!For One shall shelter you from trapper's snare,from the disease that sweeps the villages.Inside divine wings you are nestled,beneath God's pinions you are housed,a shield embracing is God's truth.You shall not fear from nighttime terror,from the arrow that soars by day,from pestilence that stalks the gloom,from feverish demon of the noon.A thousand dangers fall away beside you,yes, ten thousand of them, at your right.To you, they can't draw near.Just cast your eyes around,the payment of the wicked you shall see.For you, PRESENCE, are canopy to me,Supernal One, you've offered your abode./PI/HY	ּיֹשֵב בְּֽֽֽסֵתֶר עֶלְיוֹן	בְּצֵל שַׁדַּי יִתְלוֹנָן:	ּאֹמַר לַיהוה מַחְסִי וּמְצוּדָתִי	אֱלֹהַי אֶבְטַח-בּוֹ:	ּכִּי הוּא יַצִּילְךָ מִפַּח יָקוּשׁ	מִֽֽֽדֶּבֶר הַוּוֹת:	ּבְּאֶבְרָתוֹ ֽֽֽיָסֶךְ לָךְ	וְֽֽֽתַחַת-כְּנָפָיו תֶּחְסֶה	ּצִנָּה וְסֹחֵרָה אֲמִתּוֹ:	ּלֹא-תִירָא מִפַּחַד-ֽֽֽלָיְלָה	מֵחֵץ יָעוּף יוֹמָם:	ּמִֽֽֽדֶּבֶר בָּֽֽֽאֹפֶל יַהֲלֹךְ	מִֽֽֽקֶּטֶב יָשׁוּד צָהָֽֽֽרָיִם:	ּיִפֹּל מִצִּדְּךָ ֽֽֽאֶלֶף	וּרְבָבָה מִימִיֽֽֽנֶךָ	ּאֵֽֽֽלֶיךָ לֹא יִגָּשׁ:	ּרַק בְּעֵיֽֽֽנֶיךָ תַבִּיט	וְשִׁלֻּמַת רְשָׁעִים תִּרְאֶה:	ּכִּי-אַתָּה יהוה מַחְסִי	עֶלְיוֹן ֽֽֽשַׂמְתָּ מְעוֹֽֽֽנֶךָ:PּH/HNN<small>OTE</small>. This psalm revels in the many words for the enclave of divine pro-tection: secret [place], shade, fortress tower, wings, pinions, embracing,shield, canopy, abode, tent, angels, divine hands.    J.R.No evil shall befall you,nor shall any plague approach your tent.For God shall bid the angels to you,to protect you upon all your paths.On divine hands you shall be carried,lest your foot should strike the rock.On roaring lion and on python you shall tread,you'll trample cub and crocodile.Yes, in Me is her desire, I help her to survive,I shall exalt her, for she knows my name.He calls to Me, I answer him,with him am I in time of trial.I release him, and I pay him honor.Long are the days I satisfy her with,I look upon her with my saving help.Long are the days I satisfy him with,I look upon him with my saving help.Psalm 91N<small>OTE</small>.

The "you" of this psalm is the worshipper, who comes intoGod's presence seeking assurance of God's protection in the travails of life.The worshipper and God begin the psalm in vastly different positions.God is <i>Elyon</i>, the Most High, while the worshipper is like a small birdthat needs to be saved "from the fowler's trap." The worshipper needsshelter and protection, which God, "an encircling shield," can provide.But these polarized positions change in the imagination as the psalm pro-ceeds. Others may be subject to the terrors of night and the scourge ofnoonday, but under God's protection, the worshipper walks invulnerablythrough life, safe from enemies and disease. At the end of the description,the worshipper becomes one of the mighty beings on the planet, tramplingon lions and pythons. And God is not distant, but quite near at hand,speaking of being with the worshipper, answering each and every call. Thevoices that serve as intermediaries between the worshipper and God para-doxically convey the notion that we need no intermediary when we callon God.    H.L.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The function of angels in the Bible was primarily that of messengers asreflected in the Hebrew term <i>malaḥ</i>. Though the Bible does refer to otherkinds of angels, their function is quite sketchy. In the second Temple per-iod, the lore about angels grew quite rapidly. At several points the Hebrewliturgy utilizes biblical excerpts in ways that reflect the later understandingof angels. This is particularly the case in the three forms of <i>Kedushah</i> foundin the Shabbat and Festival morning service.    D.A.T.
