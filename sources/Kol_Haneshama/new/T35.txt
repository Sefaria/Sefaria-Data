Public worship aids us by liberating personality from the con-fining walls of the individual ego. Imprisoned in self, we easily fall preyto morbid brooding. Interference with career, personal disappointment anddisillusionment, hurts to vanity, the fear of death--all these tend so todominate our attention that our minds move in a fixed and narrow systemof ideas, which we detest but from which we see no escape. With a wholewide world of boundless opportunities about us, we permit our minds, asit were, to pace up and down within the narrow cell of their ego-prisons.But participation in public worship breaks through the prison of the egoand lets in the light and air of the world. Instead of living but one smalland petty life, we now share the multitudinous life of our people. Againstthe wider horizons that now open to our ken, personal cares do not loomso large. Life becomes infinitely more meaningful and worthwhile whenwe become aware, through our participation in public worship, of a com-mon life that transcends our individual selves.    M.M.K.

In wisdom you open heaven'sgates. With divine discernment you make seasons change,causing the times to come and go, and ordering the stars on theirappointed paths through heaven's dome, all according to yourwill. Creator of the day and night, who rolls back light beforethe dark, and dark before the light, who makes day pass awayand brings on night, dividing between day and night: TheLeader of the Multitudes of Heaven is your name!

When we are about to say: "Blessed are you, our God, sovereignof all worlds," and prepare to utter the first word "blessed," we should doso with all our strength, so that we will have no strength left to say, "areyou." And this is the meaning of the verse in the Scriptures: "But theythat wait for God shall exchange their strength." What we are really say-ing is: "Source of life, I am giving you all the strength that is within mein that very first word; now will you, in exchange, give me an abundanceof new strength, so that I can go on with my prayer."

The word playsa central role in the Jewish imagination. Our liturgy fantasizes that Godbrings on evening each night by saying "Evening!" Thus we repeat eachday the original act of Creation that took place by means of the divineword. It is only because we affirm a God who so values language that wefeel ourselves able to use words in prayer. Our word, perhaps like God's,gives expression to a depth that goes beyond language, but that can beshared only though the symbolic power of speech.    A.G.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The two <i>beraḥot</i> which precede the Shema set the stage forits evening recitation. The first <i>beraḥah</i> praises God for the wonders ofcreation that are visible at twilight: the shifting pattern of the stars, therhythm of the seasons, the regular passage from day to night. All of theseare a nightly reminder of the unchanging plan of creation.The second <i>beraḥah</i> praises God, whose instruction is a special token oflove for Israel. Israel responds by meditating upon God's teaching "dayand night," "when we lie down and when we rise." This phrasing recallsthe preceding <i>beraḥah</i>, adding Israel's study of Torah to the natural order:The sun sets, the stars shine, and Israel studies--as regularly as day andnight. The phrase "when we lie down and when we rise" anticipates theShema, which follows. This interplay between the <i>beraḥot</i> and the Shemasuggests that the Shema is Israel's morning and evening Torah study. Atthe same time, it is Israel's declaration of the oneness of the power thatmakes for the natural order and for learning, for creation and humancreativity.    S.S./KAINTERPRETIVE VERSION: ASHER BIDVAROPraised are you, God, ruler of the universe, who has ordainedthe rhythm of life. The day with its light calls to activity andexertion. But when the day wanes, when, with the setting ofthe sun, colors fade, we cease from our labors and welcome thetranquility of the night. The subdued light of the moon andstars, the darkness and the stillness about us invite rest andrepose. Trustfully we yield to the quiet of sleep, for we knowthat, while we are unaware of what goes on within and aroundus, our powers of body and mind are renewed. Therefore, at thisevening hour, we seek composure of spirit. We give thanks forthe day and its tasks and for the night and its rest. Praised areyou, God, who brings on the evening.1945 Reconstructionist Prayer Book (adapted)/KAINTERPRETIVE VERSION: AHAVAT OLAMWe are loved by an unending love.We are embraced by arms that find useven when we are hidden from ourselves.We are touched by fingers that soothe useven when we are too proud for soothing.We are counseled by voices that guide useven when we are too embittered to hear.We are loved by an unending love.We are supported by hands that uplift useven in the midst of a fall.We are urged on by eyes that meet useven when we are too weak for meeting.We are loved by an unending love.Embraced, touched, soothed, and counseled...ours are the arms, the fingers, the voices;ours are the hands, the eyes, the smiles;We are loved by an unending love.Blessed are you, BELOVED ONE, who loves your people Israel.Rami M. Shapiro (adapted)/KAAHAVAT OLAM / GOD'S LOVE IN TORAHFor additional readings see pages 740-753, 775-778./KATRADITIONAL VERSIONWith everlasting love, you love the house of Israel. Torah andmitzvot, laws and justice you have taught us. And so, DEAR ONE,our God, when we lie down and when we rise, we reflect uponyour laws; we take pleasure in your Torah's words and yourmitzvot, now and always. Truly, they are our life, our length ofdays. On them we meditate by day and night. Your love willnever depart from us as long as worlds endure. Blessed are you,B<small>ELOVED </small>O<small>NE</small>, who loves your people Israel.K<small>AVANAH</small>. The עמש / Shema is wrapped in הבהא / <i>ahavah</i> / love. The bless-ing preceding the Shema concludes, "who loves your people Israel." Thisprayer begins "תבהאו / <i>ve'ahavta</i>, And you must love הוהי!" First you areloved, then you respond with love. Love is central to Jewish life. Lovemeans commitment and limitations--Torah and mitzvot. That is so bothin our relationships with each other and in our relationship with God.<small>L.W.K.</small>D<small>ERASH</small>. The term Sheḥinah implies that God is not aloof from humanlife with all its defeats and triumphs. God is in the very midst of life. Therabbis say that when people suffer for their sins, the Sheḥinah cries out.The Sheḥinah thus moves from Israel to all humanity.    M.M.K.

Our text follows the Sephardic version, in the declarativemode ("Your love will never depart from us.") rather than the imperative("Never remove your love from us!"). Divine love is unconditional. It isavailable to every one of us when we fashion our lives into channels toreceive and share it. The Jewish people together experience that eternallove as reflected in our love for the study of Torah--a wisdom lovinglyreceived, shared, and passed on enriched by each generation.

The traditional wording of Biblical Selection II presentsdetailed bountiful or devastating consequences of Israel's collective rela-tionship to the mitzvot. This biblical section (Deuteronomy 11:13-21)offers a supernatural theology that many contemporary Jews find difficult.The biblical section on this page (Deuteronomy 28:1-6, 30:15-19) wasincluded in the 1945 Reconstructionist Siddur. It begins by encouragingobservance in the same language, but concentrates on the positive ways inwhich observance of mitzvot focuses our attention on God's presence asperceived through productivity and the pursuit of abundant life.    S.S.K<small>AVANAH</small>. The doctrine of the unity of God calls for the integration of alllife's purposes into a consistent pattern of thought and conduct.    M.M.K.But if your heart should turn away,and you not heed, and go astray,and you submit to other gods and serve them,I declare to you today that you shall bedestroyed completely; you shall not live outa great expanse of days upon the landthat you now cross the Jordan to possess.I call as witnesses concerning youboth heaven and earth, both life and death,that I have placed in front of youa blessing and a curse.Choose life, that you may live,you and your seed!Continue with page 578./KABIBLICAL SELECTION IIIf you truly listen to my bidding, as I bid you now--loving THEFOUNT OF LIFE, your God, and serving God with all your heart,with every breath--then I will give you rain upon your land inits appointed time, the early rain and later rain, so you maygather in your corn, your wine and oil. And I will give you grassupon your field to feed your animals, and you will eat and becontent. Beware, then, lest your heart be led astray, and you gooff and worship other gods, and you submit to them, so that theanger of THE MIGHTY ONE should burn against you, and seal upthe heavens so no rain would fall, so that the ground would notgive forth her produce, and you be forced to leave the good landI am giving you./PID<small>ERASH</small>.

The traditional second paragraph of the Shema (Deuteronomy11:13-21) offers an account of the natural process by which the blessingsof God themselves lead to pride, self-satisfaction, and ingratitude on thepart of those who receive them. Ironically, the more we are blessed, so itseems, the less grateful and aware of blessing we become. It is when weare most sated, Scripture warns us, that we should be most careful. Fullnesscan lead to ingratitude, and ingratitude to idolatry--primarily in the formof worship of our own accomplishments. Then, indeed, "the heavensmight close up and no rain fall." For, once we begin to worship ourachievements, we will never find satisfaction.    A.G.So place these words upon your heart, into your lifebreath. Bindthem as a sign upon your hand, and let them rest before youreyes.

The statement of God's oneness unifies not only the con-text of Shema but the text as well--three scriptural paragraphs specifiedin the Mishnah (a second century codification of Jewish law).

The fringesremind us that we voluntarily follow the way of God, who freed us fromEgyptian slavery. It is, literally, a string tied around our finger.    L.W.K.םירצמ / <i>Mitzrayim</i> was the escaping Hebrews', not the Egyptians', name forthe land of Egypt: perhaps a slave-term, and probably not of Semitic ori-gin, it has associations with the root ררצ, to be in distress, constricted, inanguish, or in dire straits. This word powerfully evokes the chokingoppression of slavery. As the psalmist wrote: הי יתארק רצמה ןמ / From thedepths I called to Yah.

According to rabbinic tradition, there are 613 mitzvot in theTorah. A combination of gematria (Jewish numerology) and ritual mac-rame "proves" that תיציצ / <i>tzitzit</i> equals all 613 mitzvot combined: צ = 90,י = 10, צ = 90, י = 10, ת = 400; all together = 600. Each <i>tzitzit</i> has 8strands (per corner) and 5 knots; 8 + 5 = 13; 13 + 600 = 613.    L.W.K.םכיניע ירחא / after what catches your eye, that is, the physical and materialtemptations you see. The Baal Shem Tov had a method for dealing withdistractions, especially sexual ones. If you can't get that person out of yourthoughts, remember that beauty is a reflection of God's image. Redirectthat energy towards God.    L.W.K.תלכת is Sidon blue, which is obtained from a shellfish. Sidon or royal blueis associated with majesty--even today the British queen wears a blue sash.The Jews were so oppressed at the time of Bar Koḥbah that indigo, a vege-table dye, replaced Sidon blue on their <i>tzitzit</i>. The Romans banned theblue fringe because of its symbolism. During the nineteenth century theRadnizer <i>ḥasidim</i> reintroduced its use. Now other Jews have also begun touse it. The long <i>teḥelet</i> thread intertwined with short white ones is a com-plex and powerful image that hints at the interplay between majesty andsubject within our own hearts.    E.M.
