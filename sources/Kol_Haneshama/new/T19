Listen, Israel: /SCT/XXHE /XXE/XXTERNAL/XX is our God, /SCT/XXHE /XXE/XXTERNAL /XXO/XXNE/XX
alone!/PR

Blessed be the name and glory of Godòs realm forever!/PR

/PR

And you must love /SCT/XXHE /XXO/XXNE/XX, your God, with your whole heart,
with every breath, with all you have. Take these words that I
command you now to heart. Teach them intently to your
children. Speak them when you sit inside your house or walk
upon the road, when you lie down and when you rise. And bind
them as a sign upon your hand, and keep them visible before
your eyes. Inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on
your gates./PI/PR

ר  / Listen, Israel. The core of our worship is not a prayer at all,
but a cry to our fellow-Jews and fellow-humans. In it we declare that God
is one--which is also to say that humanity is one, that life is one, that joys
and sufferings are all one--for God is the force that binds them all
together. There is nothing obvious about this truth, for life as we experi-
ence it seems infinitely fragmented. Human beings seem isolated from one
another, divided by all the fears and hatreds that make up human history.
Even within a single life, one moment feels cut off from the next, memo-
ries of joy and fullness offering us little consolation when we are depressed
or lonely. To assert that all is one in God is our supreme act of faith. No
wonder that the Shema, the first "prayer" we learn in childhood, is also
the last thing we are to say before we die. The memory of these words on
the lips of martyrs deepens our faith as we call them out each day.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. From recognition of our place in nature in the first blessing
of this part of the service, we shifted to concern with our moral place in
the second blessing. As creatures made conscious of our ultimate worth by
love, we recite the Shema. We thereby enter into a partnership aimed at
transforming the world and ourselves in the light of that vision of ultimate
worth.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The traditional wording of Biblical Selection II presents
detailed bountiful or devastating consequences of Israelòs collective rela-
tionship to the mitzvot. That biblical section (Deuteronomy 11:13-21)
offers a supernatural theology that many contemporary Jews find difficult.
The biblical selection on this page (Deuteronomy 28:1-6, 30:15-19) was
included in the 1945 Reconstructionist siddur. It begins by encouraging
observance in the same language, but concentrates on the positive ways in
which observance of mitzvot focuses our attention on Godòs presence as
perceived through productivity and the pursuit of abundant life.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

And if you truly listen to my bidding, as I bid you now--loving
/SCT/XXHE /XXF/XXOUNT OF /XXL/XXIFE/XX, your God, and serving God with all your
heart, with every breath--then I will give you rain upon your
land in its appointed time, the early rain and later rain, so you
may gather in your corn, your wine and oil. And I will give you
grass upon your field to feed your animals, and you will eat and
be content. Beware, then, lest your heart be led astray, and you
go off and worship other gods, and you submit to them, so that
the anger of /SCT/XXHE /XXM/XXIGHTY /XXO/XXNE/XX should burn against you, and
seal up the heavens so no rain would fall, so that the ground
would not give forth her produce, and you be forced to leave
the good land I am giving you./PR

/PR

So place these words upon your heart, into your lifebreath. Bind
them as a sign upon your hand, and let them rest before your
eyes. Teach them to your children, speaking of them when you
sit at home, and when you walk upon the road, when you lie
down, and when you rise. Inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates--so that your days and your childrenòs
days be many on the land /SCT/XXHE /XXF/XXAITHFUL /XXO/XXNE/XX promised to give
your ancestors, as long as heaven rests above the earth./PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. The traditional second paragraph of the Shema (Deuteronomy
11:13-21) offers an account of the natural process by which the blessings
of God themselves lead to pride, self-satisfaction, and ingratitude on the
part of those who receive them. Ironically, the more we are blessed, so it
seems, the less grateful and aware of blessing we become. It is when we
are most sated, Scripture warns us, that we should be most careful. Fullness
can lead to ingratitude, and ingratitude to idolatry--primarily in the form
of worship of our own accomplishments. Then, indeed, "the heavens
might close up and no rain fall." For, once we begin to worship our
achievements, we will never find satisfaction.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. What human action could result in the destruction of the
rains, the onset of crop failure and famine? Abuse of the eco-system upon
which our very lives depend. And how could such an event occur? When
we lose sight of our place in the world and the wondrous gift in all that
is. The traditional second paragraph of the Shema was replaced by another
biblical selection in earlier Reconstructionist liturgy because the traditional
paragraph was understood as literal reward and punishment. However,
today in the light of our awareness of the human abuse of the environ-
ment, we recognize that often this reward and punishment rest in our own
hands. This ancient and yet vital message of the Torah urges us to choose
life.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

it and remember all the mitzvot of the /SCE/XXTERNAL /XXO/XXNE/XX. And do
them, so you wonòt go off after the lusts of your heart or after
what catches your eye, so that you remember to do all my
mitzvot and be holy for your God. I am /SCT/XXHE /XXF/XXAITHFUL /XXO/XXNE/XX,
your God, who brought you from Mitzrayim to be for you a
God. I am /SCT/XXHE /XXI/XXNFINITE/XX, your God./PR

ור ן / so that you remember. The /ITtzitzit/XX, like all the forms of religion,
are there as reminders for us as we go about our daily lives. All of us have
had moments when we most became ourselves, liberated from the bonds
holding us back, or when we discovered those great inner truths that lend
meaning to our lives. But such moments are forgotten, covered over by
the petty angers and frustrations of daily living, by the hard shell we think
we need about us to protect our most precious feelings./PR

/PR

Our tradition calls upon us to bring such moments back to mind and make
them part of our worship. Our own innermost liberation is our "coming
out of Egypt"; our own moment of deepest truth is our "standing before
Sinai". Let us remember these as we look at our /ITtzitzit/XX, and join them to
the ancient memories of our people.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. /ITEmet Veyatziv/XX is an affirmation of the Shema. We join the last
words of the Shema to  as a statement of our ongoing commitment to
their truth. Both  / truth and ן / Amen are derived from a root
meaning "strong" or "firm". It has also been noted that the three letters
of  span the Hebrew alphabet; they are its beginning, middle, and end.
In contrast, the letters of ר / lie are all huddled together in a single cor-
ner of the alphabet. Truth is broad and all-encompassing; we have to
expand our minds in order to embrace it. Lies, like gossip and malicious
talk, bring out the narrowness within us. Let us commit ourselves, in
affirming the Shema, to breadth of vision and the ongoing search for
truth.    /SC/XXL.W.K./A.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The sequence of this part of the service moves from Cre-
ation (/ITYotzer/XX) to love and revelation (/ITAhavah Rabah/XX), to affirmation of our
commitment (Shema) and now to redemption. In this way the idea is
expressed that redemption becomes possible only if we participate in mak-
ing it happen./PR

/PR

The symbol of redemption in the mythic life of the Jewish people is the
crossing of the Sea. In the rabbinic imagination, the ancient Israelites slog
through mud up to their knees, their waists, even their chests. It falls to
us to continue the task of redemption--to face the contemporary morass
and find the resolve to wade through it with waves threatening to sub-
merge us on either hand. We wade toward a future that at our darkest
moments seems but a dim hope. The hint of the Promised Land is in our
loving moments./PR

/PR

We join in singing what the Israelites proclaimed after they had success-
fully crossed the Sea and find in their redemption the strength to seek our
own. This struggle carries us into the /ITAmidah/XX, a prayer of becoming, of
transformation, of divine-human partnership that brings grace into our
lives and into our world.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

/SCG/XXUIDED /XXM/XXEDITATION/XX. The astounding moment of awe and thanksgiving
experienced by the Israelites upon the crossing of the Red Sea has parallels
in all of our lives. We have all had difficult crossings, experiences that we
struggled through in spite of the pain they caused us. Thus completion
afforded us a sublime sense of inner joy and peace. Take a moment to recall
one of those times. Allow the feelings of celebration to envelop you. Hold

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. Rabbi Judah said: [At the sea] each tribe said to the other, "You
go into the sea first!" As they stood there bickering, Nah/±shon ben
Aminadav jumped into the water. God said to Moses, who had been pray-
ing, "My friend is drowning--and you pray!" "What can I do?" Moses
asked. God responded, "Speak to the people of Israel and tell them to go!
