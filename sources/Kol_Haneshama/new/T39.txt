/KAYIZKOR / MEMORIAL SERVICE/PR

/IT/MDYizkor/XX, the memorial service, is recited on Yom Kippur, Shemini Atzeret, Shavuot, and the
last day of Pesah/±. Traditionally it is recited after the /MDHaftarah/XX in the Torah service, but
recitation of /MDYizkor/XX can be shifted to any other time in the service. /MDYizkor/XX prayers are
customarily said while standing. Some congregations read a list of those who are to be
remembered. Others publish a remembrance book./PR

The following introductory section to /MDYizkor/XX can be expanded or reduced. /MDEli Eli/XX (page
839) or other songs might be added. For additional suitable readings see pages 787-796./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Calling to mind the memory of relatives or friends who
have departed and giving /ITtzedakah/XX in their memory is a longstanding
custom. It is mentioned in the medieval work /ITMidrash Tanh/±uma/XX, as a Yom
Kippur custom, though the /ITYizkor/XX prayers themselves are somewhat later
in origin. Recitation of /ITYizkor/XX on the Pilgrimage Festivals began in Euro-
pean communities after the bloody destruction associated with the
Crusades./PR

/PR

Because it was superstitiously believed that being present for /ITYizkor/XX when
oneòs parents were living could hasten their death, it used to be the case
that only those required to say /ITYizkor/XX because of the death of an immediate
relative remained in the synagogue. After the Holocaust, which left so
many with no one to say /ITYizkor/XX for them, liberal congregations have
encouraged everyone to join in reciting /ITYizkor/XX. People are encouraged to
recite /ITYizkor/XX for each person whose memory is cherished. The traditional
phrase said of the dead, /ITzikaron livrah/±ah/XX / the memory for a blessing,
reminds us that part of our purpose in remembering is to have our memo-
ries influence us to do good. This influence is made tangible in the custom
of giving /ITtzedakah/XX in memory of loved ones before the holiday begins./PR

The night I lost you/PR

someone pointed me towards/PR

Go that way, they said,/PR

itòs easy, like learning to climb/PR

And so I climbed./PR

Denial was first./PR

I sat down at breakfast/PR

carefully setting the table/PR

for two. I passed you the toast--/PR

you sat there. I passed/PR

you the paper--you hid/PR

behind it./PR

Anger seemed more familiar./PR

I burned the toast, snatched/PR

the paper and read the headlines myself./PR

But they mentioned your departure/PR

and so I moved on to/PR

Bargaining. What could I exchange/PR

for you? The silence/PR

after storms? My typing fingers?/PR

Before I could decide, Depression/PR

came puffing up, a poor relation/PR

its suitcase tied together/PR

with string. In the suitcase/PR

were bandages for the eyes/PR

and bottles of sleep. I slid/PR

all the way down the stairs/PR

feeling nothing./PI/PR

And all the time Hope/PR

flashed on and off/PR

in defective neon./PR

Hope was a signpost pointing/PR

straight in the air./PR

Hope was my uncleòs middle name,/PR

he died of it./PR

After a year I am still climbing,/PR

though my feet slip/PR

on your stone face./PR

The treeline/PR

has long since disappeared;/PR

green is a color/PR

I have forgotten./PR

But now I see what I am climbing/PR

towards: Acceptance/PR

Acceptance./PR

Its name is in lights./PR

I struggle on,/PR

waving and shouting./PR

Below, my whole life spreads its surf,/PR

all the landscape Iòve ever known/PR

a fish jumps: the pulse/PR

Acceptance. I finally/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. In this /ITEl Maley Rah/±amim/XX specific references to those who
have died fighting in Israelòs wars and those murdered in the Holocaust
have been added to the traditional phrase "all those who have given up
their lives in affirmation of your holy Name." These events of our time
demand special recognition. Sanctification of Godòs name through volun-
tary martyrdom was an altogether too common phenomenon in the rab-
binic and medieval periods, which were often punctuated by savage perse-
cution. Death in the Holocaust was qualitatively different because it could
not be averted by the victim--even conversion had no power to save. Many
contemporary Jews view the tragic events of the Holocaust as a lessening
of Godòs presence in the world, though acts of bravery, piety, and caring
manifested the divine even then./PR

/PR

Israeli soldiers generally understand their sacrifices to be for the sake of
their families and their people rather than as part of an effort to make
God manifest. Nonetheless their sacrifices, which have revived and pre-
served Israel as a Jewish home, have a meaning to Jews everywhere far
beyond that of acres of land. They have kept alive a dream we share--our
land, not only free, but at peace.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR
