From the words of our sages, of blessed memory, on prayer./PR

/PR

Our rabbis learned as mishnah: One who prays should train the
heart toward heaven. Abba Shaul says: The matteròs prooftext is
the following (Psalm 10:17): "Strengthen their heart, give them
your ear!"/PR

/PR

It is taught: Rabbi Judah said: Thus was Rabbi Akibaòs
custom--when he prayed amid the congregation, he would arise
in shortened prayer, out of respect for public needs; but when
praying by himself, one would leave him in one corner of the
room only to find him in another. Why all this? Because of all
the restless fervor of his kneelings and prostrations./PR

Mishnah Berah/±ot 3:7/XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. ןנבר ונ / /ITOur rabbis learned/XX. The Hebrew expression used
here indicates that the passage comes from a /ITberayta/XX, a text dating from
the same period as the Mishnah. Before praying, the rabbis say, one must
first orient or direct the heart. In biblical and rabbinic thought, the heart
is the locus of both intellect and emotion. The Hebrew word used for
"train" is /ITkaven/XX, the verb from which /ITkavanah/XX or "direction" is taken.
/ITKavanah/XX refers to the inward state of mind with which we approach prayer
or any other sacred action. It is a combination of awareness and inward
intensity that grows with the regular practice of the religious life. Abba
Shaul is suggesting that only such carefully prepared prayer reaches the
ear of God. Judaism has always understood that it is the heart rather than
the lips that truly bears the power of prayer.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The study of Torah is an integral part of Jewish prayer. At
several points in the prayerbook, notably at the end of the introductory
morning prayers, at the Torah reading, and following the Shabbat after-
noon service, place is made for study./PR

/PR

Jews believe that one of the ways in which we encounter the Divine pres-
ence is through the study of sacred text. Those who spoke the words
recorded here, as well as those who wrote them down and those who stud-
ied them over the ages, have poured into them the heart and soul of their
own religious lives. As the text comes to life in our dialogue with it, some-
thing of the intensity of prior generationsò love and devotion speaks to us
through the textòs words. Thus the process of Torah study joins us to the
line of tradition, and renews in us our commitment to enriching and
renewing that tradition as we pass it on to our children.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

Said Rav H/±amnuna, See how many major principles we learn
from these verses about Hannah [I Samuel 1:13ff.]: "And
Hannah was speaking in her heart"--from this one learns to
direct the heart while praying. "Only her lips were
moving"--from this one learns to pray shaping the words
distinctly with the lips. "But her voice could not be
heard"--from this one learns that raising the voice in prayer is
forbidden. "And [Eli] thought that she was drunk"--from this
one learns that praying while drunk is forbidden. "And Eli said
to her, `How long will you be drunk...ò" Rabbi Eliezer said: From
this one learns that when one sees another doing something
improper, one should rebuke the person./PR

/PR

And Hannah answered, saying, `No, master...ò" Ulla said (and
some say Rabbi Yosi in the name of Rabbi H/±anina): Hannah
replied, "You are no master in this matter, and the Holy Spirit
does not rest with you if you suspect me in this way." There are
those who say: Thus did she say to him, "The Sheh/±inah and the
Holy Spirit do not rest with you, for you have judged me by the
scale of guilt, not by the scale of merit. Have you not known
that I am a woman sore of spirit? Neither wine nor liquor have
I drunk." Rabbi Eliezer said: From this one learns that one
wrongly accused of something should make the error known to
the accuser./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. In this /ITGemara/XX passage, the rabbis derive many laws about
proper conduct in prayer from the opening narrative of Samuel I. Elkanah
and his two wives, Peninah and Hannah, who is childless, have made a
pilgrimage to the sanctuary at Shiloh. There, Hannah prays silently but
urgently for a child. Eli the High Priest, noticing her odd behavior, accuses
her of drunkenness. Hannah justifies herself, and Eli blesses her. The
heartfelt prayer of an ordinary woman has a moral authority to which even
a high priest must accede.    /SC/XXR.A./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The prayer of Hannah is an example of private rather than
public worship. She has gone to pour out her heart before God in the holy
place. It is striking that our tradition derives its rules for public prayer
behavior from this entirely private and individual example. As important
as the role of community was to the rabbinic view of prayer, the rabbis
also understood that prayer at its core is a matter of the heart alone. The
depth and sincerity of Hannahòs prayer became a model for them. This
apparently included the very strong and seemingly audacious way in which
Hannah spoke both to Eli and to God. The model of prayer offered here
is hardly one of submission and entreaty. Hannah stood up to both human
and divine authority demanding that she be treated justly and recognized
for the wronged person that she was.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

before the blessed Holy One: "Sovereign of the Universe, with
all the endless multitudes you have created in your world, why
should it be so difficult for You to give me but a single child?!"/PR

A parable: what is this matter like? Like a king of

"Give me but a single piece of bread!" But they didnòt pay
attention to her. The pauper persisted, entering the kingòs house,
and said to him: "My lord king, with all this feast that you have
made, is it so difficult for you to give me but a single piece of
bread?!"/PR

רנ רו / And she vowed. To Hannah is attributed here the great privilege
of having created a new name for God. /ITAdonay tzevaòot/XX, often translated
"the Lord of Hosts," is usually taken to refer to Godòs glory dwelling
among the angelic throngs. Here the rabbis accept a sharp revision of that
belief. It is Hannah, calling out in her bitterness, who gives God this
name. She sees the One surrounded by countless throngs, who may
include other peopleòs children as well as angels. "You who have made so
many," she says, or "who are surrounded by so much wealth, could You
not create but one child for me?"/PR

/PR

The pain of Hannahòs childlessness has here entered into our prayerbook
and enriched the prayers of all those who come in her wake. This is the
real contribution of Hannah and the way in which we believe prayer is
fulfilled rather than "answered." While we do not know a God who hears
a would-be parentòs prayer and grants a child, we affirm the tradition that
has carried both Hannahòs pain and her faith forward and allowed them
to enrich and inspire the prayer life of so many generations.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

concerning her heart. She said before God: "Sovereign of the

nothing in vain--her eyes to see with, ears to hear with, nose
to smell with, mouth to speak with, hands to work with, feet
on which to walk about, breasts to suckle with. These breasts
that you have placed over my heart, should they not suckle a
child? Give me a child, then, to nurse!"/PR

"And /SCT/XXHE /XXA/XXLL-/XXK/XXNOWING/XX said to Moses, `Go down...ò"--what

One said to Moses, "Moses, descend from your greatness.
Havenòt I bestowed greatness upon you only for Israelòs sake?
And now that Israel has sinned, what do I need you for?"
Thereupon, Mosesò strength gave out, and he had no power to
speak. And when God later said, "Give me leave to destroy
them," Moses told himself: "Everything depends on me."
Immediately, he stood up, praying intensely, begging Godòs
mercy. A parable: A king was angry with his child, and sought
to strike him hard. One who loved the king sat by, afraid to
speak out in the childòs defense. The king said to the child:
"Were it not for this friend of mine who sits nearby, Iòd kill
you!" Said the friend to himself: "Everything depends on me."
Thereupon, he stood up and saved the child./PR

 נ / leave me alone. Rabbi Abbahu presents the strongest possible case
for the tenacity and daring required of the heroes of prayer. Like the previ-
ous selection, this passage interprets Mosesòs confrontation of God after
the idolatry of the golden calf. If Scripture itself had not reported that
God said, "Let go of me," (Exodus 32:7) Rabbi Abbahu would have
thought it blasphemous. How can a limited human being constrain an infi-
nite God? Yet the expression implies that by arguments and insistences,
Moses was preventing God from withdrawing from the relationship, just
as one might grab a recalcitrant friend by the lapel.    /SC/XXR.A./XX/PR

Our prayer is a part of the cosmic symphony. As we raise our voices in
prayer and song, or as we turn toward God in silence and thoughtful medi-
tation, we join ourselves to this chorus of creation. The prayers of Israel
are recited in a special language and a distinctive form. There is a way in
which they belong to the Jewish people and to us alone. But prayer is also
a universal act, one that binds the whole human community together with
all of nature, calling forth in us an appreciation of life as an ongoing cele-
bration of the gift of being.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR
