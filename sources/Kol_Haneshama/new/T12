/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. /ITBaruh/± Sheòamar/XX. Our morning psalm service begins with
the words "Blessed is the one who spoke." We begin to pray by proclaim-
ing the divinity and great power of words themselves. The prayerbook
conveys our sense of inadequacy of coming before God with human lan-
guage. How can words ever be adequate vehicles for expressing our most
inward thoughts?/PR

/SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The God affirmed in the words of /ITBaruh/± Sheòamar/XX may be
understood in either concrete anthropomorphic terms or in a more abstract
manner. It is the latter view with which we Reconstructionists are most
comfortable. Our God is not a person who promises and fulfills as a
human being would. In speaking of a God who fulfills promises, we
express our basic trust in life and our affirmation that goodness and godli-
ness have their own reward.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. /ITBaruh/± Sheòamar/XX is the rabbinic composition that introduces
/ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX/Verses of Praise, which traditionally is compiled from
biblical passages, primarily from Psalms./PR

/PR

The focus of /ITBirh/±ot Hashah/±ar/XX is on physical awakening. In /ITPesukey
Dezimrah/XX the kaleidoscopic imagery awakens our emotions. Just as we find
our own pace walking through art museums, so /ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX invites
each of us to wander amidst its visions. On different days, different
imagery comes to life. /ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX moves us toward prayerfulness,
toward readiness to join in spiritual community.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. /ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX begins with an apology for verbal prayer. It is
only because God "spoke the world into being" that we dare to assume
that words can serve as the vehicles for our deepest prayers. In participating
in verbal prayer, we somehow partake of that same act of Divine word--
power through which the world was created. A H/±asidic comment on the
opening line of /ITBaruh/± Sheòamar/XX translates it: "A /ITbaruh/±/XX (blessing) that is said
and creates a world--thatòs a /ITbaruh/±/XX!"    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. According to the Mishnah, some Jews regularly meditated
for an hour before beginning public prayer. As the public prayer service
expanded, this time of personal preparation became filled with a collection
of psalms and other biblical selections that became known as /ITPesukey
Dezimrah/XX--"Verses of Song". Rabbinic literature records many variations
of /ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX, but common to all versions are selections from Psalms
146-150, known as the "Hallel Psalms" because they feature variations of
that term as a praise of God. Another important Hallel psalm--136-- is
also a traditional part of this section. The central importance of these
psalms indicates that the major theme of /ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX is the praise
(Hallel) of God. Indeed, the Talmud sometimes refers to /ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX
as the daily Hallel./PR

Blessed are you, /SCT/XXHE /XXE/XXVERLASTING /XXO/XXNE/XX, our God, the sovereign
of all worlds. Divine one, who gave birth to all, the merciful,
subject of praise upon our peopleòs mouths, lauded and glorified
upon the tongues of all who love and serve you. And through
these, the songs sung by your servant David, may we hail you,
/SCS/XXOURCE OF /XXB/XXEING/XX. With praises and with melodies we celebrate
your greatness, and we praise you, glorify you, call to mind your
Name, and crown you as our sovereign, God of ours, the only
one, the living one, throughout all worlds. The one who reigns,
lauded and glorified unto the end of time, whose name is ever
great. Blessed are you, /SCT/XXHE /XXO/XXNE/XX, the sovereign hailed in songs
of praise./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Although the patchwork of psalms and praises known as
/ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX is said to have evolved centuries after the prayer service
itself, one can sense in this preface to the service an important echo of
worship in biblical times--both the daily service of priests and Levites in
the Temple, and the prayers of pilgrims ascending to the Holy City for
the seasonal festivals. This bold appropriation of historical memory, under-
taken in a period of exile and dispersion, affirms the continuity of biblical
Israel with the later people Israel--in effect, inscribing the image of the
former upon the latter. All of the themes and moods of the service are
present in /ITPesukey Dezimrah/±/XX.    /SC/XXJ.R./XX/PR

דימת וינפ ושקב / search out the divine presence always. The Hebrew literally
reads "Seek His face always." The religious person is one who knows in
each situation how to seek "the face of God." Whatever befalls us and
wherever life may lead, we find ourselves still seeking. Each unique human
situation calls upon us to find Godòs presence and act upon it in a unique
way.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. The service of gratitude is eternal. As the Rabbis put it (Leviticus
Rabah 9), though in the time to come all sacrifices will cease, the thank--
offering will never cease. It will last on in eternity; thanksgiving will never
become obsolete in the realms of spiritual bliss. A world full of
praise--how near to heaven it would be! We must bring ourselves into line
with such ideals. Our worship must not be impatient supplication, but
patient praise. We must think less of what we lack, more of what we
have.    /SC/XXM.M.K./XX/PR

modern physics and astronomy. The music of the spheres and that of the
