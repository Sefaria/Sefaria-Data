/KAAMIDAH MEDITATIONS/XX/PR

These meditations (pages 726-729) are alternatives to the
Shabbat /ITAmidah/XX. Traditionally recited thrice daily, the /ITAmidah/XX
originally served as a time for meditation. That path is
inaccessible to many of us. These meditations are intended to
restore it. They can be self-guided or leader-directed. Leaders
might guide a whole congregation or groups as small as two or
three. Leadership can be rotated./PR

/PR

In meditating with a leader/guide, participants are led by the
guideòs voice. If the leader moves too quickly for you, move at
your own pace, allowing your mind to carry you until you are
again in step with the leader. In meditating without a
leader/guide, select a meditation and read the instructions. Then
close your eyes and sit comfortably, with both feet on the
ground, hands resting loosely in your lap. Take a few deep
breaths, then begin the meditation. Be careful not to let your
thoughts wander--if they do, bring them back by taking a few
deep breaths. Proceed at your own pace. Do not hurry. When
you have completed one meditation, feel free to begin another./PR

/PR

A single meditation, or up to three, might serve as the /ITAmidah/XX./PR

/KA1. AVOT/XX/PR

Think about the people to whom you answer....Who is your
inner "board of directors"?...Who is it you are serving in your
life?...Who are your Abrahams, Isaacs, Jacobs, your Sarahs,
Rebekahs, Rachels and Leahs?...Donòt struggle with the voices
or engage them in any way....Simply acknowledge them....Invite
them into your Shabbat....Feel at one with them./PR

/PR

/KA2. GEVUROT/XX/PR

Think of a part of your present life--a personality, relationship,
or situation--that feels stagnant to you....Something isnòt right.
It isnòt growing. There is a lifeless quality to it....Imagine how
you might enliven that part of your life. What things might you
do to bring that change about?...Now think of a part of your
life you have enlivened, either recently or over the years....Allow
yourself to feel gratitude and joy for that./PR

/KA3. KEDUSHAT HASHEM/XX/PR

Slowly recite this chant to yourself: /ITAtah kadosh, shimeh/±a kadosh,
veòanu kedoshim/XX. Try to feel the rhythm of this chant. If it is
comfortable for you, stand as you chant, bow to the right and
to the left, then raise your hands and look up. The literal
meaning of this chant is: "You are holy, your name is holy, and
we are holy beings." As you recite this chant, allow yourself to
feel the holiness of all life, and the holy cycles of life./PR

Remember a moment in your life when you felt a sense of
perfection....Try to dwell on images of that moment until they
are completely in focus: the visual image, the sounds, the
physical sensations, the emotions. Do not rush this....Try to
recapture that sense of perfection and think, "This is my
Shabbat, this is my Shabbat."/PR

/KA5. AVODAH/XX/PR

Imagine a long table, around which is gathered your ideal
community....Focus on the different members of that ideal
community. Feel the sense of awe and thanksgiving at such a
miracle. Immerse yourself in those feelings of joy....Take that
sense of joy and refocus it on the community of Israel,
regathered in our homeland, and the joy that brings you. Allow
yourself to take in the miracle of that ingathering./PR

/KA6. HODAòAH/XX/PR

Recall a recent event in your life for which you would like to
offer thanks. Focus on that one event for a moment....Allow
your mind to associate freely. Remember other events in your
life that have evoked in you a sense of thanksgiving....Feel
yourself immersed in a sea of blessings that have occurred in
your life, and for which you now offer thanks./PR

/KA8. SHIVITI MEDITATIONS/XX/PR

The /ITShiviti/XX is a spiritual tool. It provides a visual focus for efforts
to sense the divine presence. Facing that presence through the
/ITShiviti/XX design, feeling surrounded by the divine embracing the
divine within ourselves leads to awareness of the fullness of
God--and to the godliness which fills us. The /ITShiviti/XX meditation
can yield new insight--a sense of harmony and balance. It can
give us a sense of our place in the order of things. It can provide
fresh perspective, clarity, and energy. The /ITShiviti/XX designs are on
pages 89, 293 and 595. The first-time user can begin by
exploring the /ITShiviti/XX--responding to its overall shape, reading
its words, contemplating their meanings. More focused
meditations on the /ITShiviti/XX appear below./PR

/PR

(a) Let the fullness of this /ITShiviti/XX flow over you....Slowly begin
to focus on one of the psalm verses on the /ITShiviti/XX page. Breathe
in and out slowly and steadily....Now close your eyes. Visualize
the /ITyud hey vav hey/XX....Slowly chant to yourself the words of your
verse. Let all extraneous thoughts flow away from you. Allow
yourself to feel the presence of God./PR

/KAIntroduction to Maòariv/XX/PR

Our noisy day has now descended with the sun beyond our
sight, and in the silence of our praying place we close the door
upon the hectic joys and fears, the accomplishments and
anguish, of the week that we have left behind. What was but
moments ago the substance of our life has now become its
memory, and what we did must now be woven into who we are.
On this day we shall not do, but be; we are to walk the outer
limits of our humanity, no longer ride unseeing through a world
we only vaguely sense beneath our cushioned wheels. On this
day heat and warmth and light must come from deep within
ourselves; no longer can we tear apart the world to make our
fire. On this day, but a breath away from our creation , we are
to breathe in a world from which we may no longer feel apart,
but as close as eye to blossom, and ear to the singing in the
night. On this day we must open wide the windows behind
which we have hidden from the world, and send forth hand and
heart to learn where we have come, and what we have become./PR

Richard Levy (adapted)/XX/PR

#/PR

We come together on this Shabbat, each bringing to this sanctu-
ary a private world of hopes, of fears, of dreams. Some of us are
burdened by anxieties and cares that all but crush our faith in the
future. Others have hearts filled with happiness, grateful for the
joys of the past week, yet aware that even the most fortunate are
vulnerable before the mystery of tomorrow. Every life is a unique
blending of joy and sorrow, of fulfillment and frustration./PR

Beneath our uniqueness we are all bound together by our
common humanity. All of us most deeply yearn for the blessings
of freedom and peace. Each of us seeks the personal liberation
of a mind that is not enslaved to conventional wisdom, a heart
that is able to love without fear, a spirit that cries "yes!" to the
universe. Each of us strives too for the inner peace that comes
with finding a harmony between what we want out of life and
what we can have, between our aspirations and our abilities. This
is the Shabbat peace to which we aspire./PR

We know what to do with space but do not know what to do

it away, to /ITkill time/XX. However, /ITtime is life/XX, and to kill time is to
murder. Most of us seem to labor for the sake of things of space.

Most of us do not live in time but run away from it; we do not
see its face, but its make-up. The past is either forgotten or
preserved as a cliche¶, and the present moment is either bartered
for a silly trinket or beclouded by false anticipations. The present
moment is a zero, and so is the next moment, and a vast stretch
of life turns out to be a series of zeros, with no real number in
front./PR

/PR

Blind to the marvel of the present moment, we live with
memories of moments missed, in anxiety about an emptiness
that lies ahead. We are unprepared when the problem strikes us
in unmitigated form./PR

/PR

Time is our most important frontier, the advance region of
significant being, a region where our true freedom lies. Space
divides us, time unites us. We wage wars over things of space;
the treasures of time lie open to every one of us./PR

/PR

Time has independent ultimate significance; it is of more
majesty and more evocative of awe than even a sky studded with
stars. Gliding gently in the most ancient of all splendors, it tells
so much more than space can say in its broken language of
things, playing symphonies upon the instruments of isolated
beings, unlocking the earth and making it happen. Time is the
process of creation, and things of space are results of creation.
When looking at space we see the products of creation; when
intuiting time we hear the process of creation. Things of space
exhibit a deceptive independence. They show off a veneer of
limited permanence. Things created conceal the Creator. It is
the dimension of time wherein we meet God, wherein we
become aware that every instant is an act of creation, a
Beginning, opening up new roads for ultimate realizations. /ITTime
is the presence of God in the world of space/XX, and it is within time
that we are able to sense the unity of all beings./PR
