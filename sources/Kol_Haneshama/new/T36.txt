FESTIVAL MA'ARIV/HN/KAEMET VE'EMUNAH / REDEMPTION<i>The traditional /MDGe'ulah</i> is on this page; an interpretive version begins on page 582.For additional readings see pages 748, 767-771, 800.Our faith and truth rest on all this, which is binding upon us:That THE BOUNDLESS ONE alone is our divinityand that no divinity exists but One;that we are Israel, community of God;that it is God who saves us from the handof governments, the very palm of tyrants;who enacts great deeds without measure,and wondrous deeds beyond all count;who puts our souls amid the living,and who keeps our feet from giving way;who breaks apart the schemes of those who hate us,confounds the thoughts of any bearing us ill-will;that it is God who made miracles for us in Egypt,signs and wonders in Ham's children's land.From one generation to the next, God is our guarantor,and even on a day that turned to night,God stayed with us when death's deep shadow fell.And even in our age of orphans and survivors,God's loving acts have not abandoned us,and God has brought together our scattered kinfrom the distant corners of the earth.As then, so now,God brings the people Israel forthfrom every place of menace, to a lasting freedom.God is the one who brought the Israelitesthrough a divided Sea of Reeds.There, they beheld divine might;they praised and thanked the Name,and willingly accepted for themselvesGod's rule.

The present text, arewritten version, includes reference to the Holocaust, from which therewas no redemption, and return to Zion, a fulfillment of Israel's ancientdream. The same divine spirit that gave Israel the courage to seek freedomfrom Egypt in ancient times inspired those who fought for Israel's freedomin our own day. At the same time, this version omits those portions of thetext that glory in the enemy's fall or see in God a force for vengeance.All humans are God's beloved children, as were the Egyptians whodrowned at the sea.    A.G./KAINTERPRETIVE VERSIONWe acknowledge as true and trustworthy that there is but oneuniversal God, and that to God's service Israel stands eternallycommitted.We recognize in God the power that has enabled us to triumphover defeat, persecution and oppression.It was God who redeemed us from Egyptian bondage, anddelivered us from the despotism of the pharaohs.For God wills that we be free to use our powers in holy service,and be not bound to the arbitrary rule of any mortal.Whenever human rulers usurp divine authority, and exploit thepeople, those tyrants' hearts are hardened, their own arrogancewrites their doom.Therefore we will never be discouraged nor dismayed whenunrighteous powers rise up to destroy us.Though enemy hosts pursue us, we shall remember how ourancestors were saved at the Sea of Reeds.We therefore repeat the words of triumph with which they gavethanks for their deliverance:1945 Reconstructionist Prayer Book (adapted)<i>(Congregation sings הכמכ ימ</i>, page 585).C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Two beautiful <i>beraḥot</i> complete the liturgical framework ofthe Shema in the evening service. The first of these is called<i>Ge'ulah</i>--"Redemption." Recalling the Exodus from Egypt, it thematicallyechoes the third paragraph of the Shema. Moreover, it identifies the sover-eign God, named in the Shema's credo, as the power that freed Israel fromslavery. Its vivid, here-and-now recollection of the escape from Egyptianbondage invites and challenges Israel to claim the redemption as a personalexperience in each generation and to hear echoes of that ancient triumphover tyranny in each modern-day struggle for freedom, in every attemptto move toward the messianic future.

Rabbi Judah said: [At the sea] each tribe said to the other, "Yougo into the sea first!" As they stood there bickering, Naḥshon benAminadav jumped into the water. Meanwhile Moses was praying. God saidto him, "My friend is drowning--and you pray!" "What can I do?" Mosesasked. [God responded as it says in the text,] "Speak to the people of Israeland tell them to go! Raise your staff..."

Biblical references include Job 9:10, Psalm 66:9.Moses, Miriam, and all the Israelites broke out in song,abundant in their joy, and, all as one, they said:"Who among the mighty can compareto you, WISE ONE?Who can compare to you,adorned in holiness,awesome in praises,acting wondrously!"Your children saw you in your majesty,splitting the sea in front of Moses."This is my God!" they cried, and said:"THE HOLY ONE will reign forever!"And it was said:"Yes, THE REDEEMING ONE has rescued Jacob,saved himfrom a powerstronger than his own!"Blessed are you, THE GUARDIAN, Israel's redeeming power!When our ancestorsbeheld these truthsthey proclaimed:Among all the godswe can name,who can compare to theOne Beyond Naming?Among all the quantitieswe can label, number,mark and measure,which compares to theMysteryat the Heart of Reality?

The earlier Reconstructionistprayerbook omitted that reference because of its emphasis on supernaturalintervention. As myth, however, the ancient tale of wonder underscoresthe sense of daily miracle in our lives. Even those of us who cannot affirma God who intervenes in the natural process, and thus cannot accept theliteral meaning of the tale, can appreciate its human message. Accordingto the midrash, the sea did not split until one Israelite, Naḥshon benAminadav, had the courage to walk upright into the water. Perhaps it wasthe divine spirit in Naḥshon, rather than the magic of Moses's wand, thatcaused the sea to split.    A.G.N<small>OTE</small>.

It recalls the Shema by expressing the hopethat we will "lie down...in peace" and "rise again...to life." An extensionof <i>Emet Ve'emunah, Hashkivenu</i> joins the vivid recollection of past redemp-tion to a prayer for present protection and future peace. By calling God"guardian" and "protector" but also "redeemer," Israel recognizes newdimensions of the power that makes for freedom. The final acknowledg-ment of God as the one who "spreads the sukkah of peace over us, overIsrael, and over Jerusalem" conjures up the now familiar image of Shabbatas a foretaste of that future time when Israel, its people, and its holy citywill dwell in peace. This blessing is unique to the evening service. Perhapsresponding to the cold, dark uncertainty of night, we invoke God's dwell-ing of peace.    S.S.K<small>AVANAH</small>. Enable us, God, to behold meaning in the chaos of life aboutus and purpose in the chaos of life within us. Deliver us from the senseof futility in our strivings toward the light and the truth. Give us strengthto ride safely through the maelstrom of petty cares and anxieties. May webehold things in their proper proportions and see life in its wholeness andits holiness.    M.M.K. (ADAPTED)N<small>OTE</small>. For our ancestors, the future of Jerusalem was not just about thefuture of the Jewish people. Jerusalem, in the biblical vision, will becomethe capital of the whole world. Praying for the peace of Jerusalem is thesame as praying for the unity of all humanity and peace throughout theworld.    D.A.T.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The version presented here follows certain Sephardic ver-sions by deleting the series of petitions for protection. Such petition is con-sidered inappropriate on Shabbat and Festivals, days of fulfillment andappreciation for the many blessings we have. Shabbat itself is a sukkah ofpeace. We pray that real and complete peace be the lot of Israel and Jerusa-lem, so torn by strife in recent memory. Our tradition sees Jerusalem asthe center of the world. Creation began there, according to the rabbis. Somay the peace that begins there radiate forth and bless all earth's peoples.The peace of Jerusalem, the "heart of the world," is also the peace of everyhuman heart.

As we enter the dark of evening, we face the unknown. Earlier,in <i>Asher Bidvaro</i> (the Creation section immediately following <i>Bareḥu</i>), weaffirmed the power that transforms night into day and day into night. Nowwe call for protection from the shadows that lengthen around us--shadowsof fear and guilt, the uncharted future, the ever pursuing past. We ask thatthe shadows of God's wings envelop us with love and mercy. Theunknown night, like the unknown tomorrow, can only be met with faithin the power of infinite compassion to care for us.    S.P.W.When fears multiplyAnd danger threatens;When sickness comes,When death confronts us--It is God's blessing of shalomThat sustains usAnd upholds us.Lightening our burden,Dispelling our worry,Restoring our strength,Renewing our hope--Reviving us.    H.M./KAVESHAMERU / OBSERVING SHABBATWhen Shabbat coincides with a festival, add:(Let Israel's descendants keep Shabbat, making Shabbatthroughout all their generations, as an eternal bond. Betweenme and Israel's descendants shall it be a sign eternally.

The placement of Veshameru<small> after Hashkivenu</small> suggests an aspect ofthe agreement between God and Israel: God guards Israel, and Israelguards Shabbat, which is a reminder and foretaste of peace in our world.<small>S.S.</small>K<small>AVANAH</small>. The recitations of Veshameru<small> preceding the Amidah</small> and of<i>Vayḥulu</i> following it on Friday evening are acts of witnessing. In keepingShabbat Israel bears testimony to the fact that ours is a created world. Forus this means that divinity fills the universe. Our task is to treat all livingthings with respect, and so enhance the divine light in them. Only by thisway of living is the testimony of Shabbat made real.
