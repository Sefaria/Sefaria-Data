READINGS: JEWS AROUND THE WORLDREADINGS: JEWS AROUND THE WORLD/HN/KAJEWS AROUND THE WORLDWho Are These Jews?There were women who sat in the marketselling beets and cabbages so their men could study;they were Jews.There were men of Yemen, great swordsmen,guards of the king: they were Jews.There are dark women from India, wearing saris,Black farmers from Ethiopia,Children with slanted eyes: all Jews.There are dressmakers and sculptors,thieves and philanthropists, scholars and nursesbeggars and generals.There are women who follow every rule of Kashrutand men who know none of the rules,yet all of us are Jews.Though we are not alike in mind or body,somewhere in the depths of our soulswe know we are the children of one people.We share a history, a hope, and some prayers;We speak many languages;We have heard one Voice:All of us stood together at SinaiWhen our past and our futureExploded in thunder and flame before us.Ruth Brin/KAOut of the Strong, SweetnessOut of the strong, sweetness;and out of the dead body of the lion of Judah,the prophecies and psalms;out of the slaves in Egypt,out of the wandering tribesmen of the desertsand the peasants of Palestine,out of the slaves of Babylon and Rome,out of the ghettos of Spain and Portugal, Germany and Polandthe Torah and the prophecies,the Talmud and the sacred studies, the hymns and songs of theJews;and out of the Jewish deadof Belgium and Holland, of Rumania, Hungary, and Bulgaria,of France and Italy and Yugoslavia,of Lithuania and Latvia, White Russia and Ukrainia,of Czechoslovakia and Austria,Poland and Germany,out of the greatly wrongeda people teaching and doing justice;out of the plundereda generous people;out of the wounded a people of physicians;and out of those who met only with hate,a people of love, a compassionate people.Charles Reznikoff/KATORAH STUDYSomewhere out of timeIn the mystery of timeSomewhere between memory and forgetfulness,Dimly thoughI remember how once I stoodat Your mountain tremblingAmid the fire and the thunder.How I stood there, out of bondageIn a strange land and afraid.And You loved me and You fed meAnd I feasted on Your words.And, yes, I can rememberHow the thunder was my heartAnd the fire was my soul.God, I do remember.The fire burns in me anew.And here I am once moreA witness to that timeless moment.Present now in the light of Your TorahI am reborn.Nancy Lee Gossels/KAAll I Got Was WordsWhen I was a boy and fancy free,my folks had no fine clothes for me.All I got was words:<i>Got tsu danken</i>    (Thank God)<i>Zoln mir lebn un zeyn gezunt.</i>    (We should live and be well)When I was wont to travel far,They didn't provide for me a car.All I got was words:<i>Gey gezunt</i>    (Go in health)<i>Gey palmelekh</i>    (Go slowly)<i>Hob a gliklekhe rayse.</i>    (Have a good trip)I wanted to increase my knowledgeBut they couldn't send me to college.All I got was words:<i>Hob seykhel</i>    (Have common sense)<i>Zey nisht keyn nar</i>    (Don't be a fool)<i>Toyreh iz di beste skhoyre.</i>    (Torah is the best merchandise)The years have flown,the world has turned,things I've gotten, things I've learned,Yet I remember<i>Zog dem emes</i>    (Tell the truth)<i>Gib tsedukeh</i>    (Give <i>tzedakah</i>)<i>Hob rakhmones</i>    (Have compassion)<i>Zey a mensch!</i>    (Be a mensch!)Author UnknownThe rabbinic concept of language and meaning has at its centerthe concept of the divinity of the text....The text ultimately isnot...that authoritative and divine document given to Moses ata particular time and place. The Talmud claims that "the Torahpreceded the world" (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 88b). If theworld of space and time had not yet been created, then in whatmanner did the Torah exist? "It was written with letters of blackfire upon a background of white fire" (Rashi on Deuteronomy33:2). The material ink and parchment are seen as the garmentsfor the divine wisdom enclothed therein.In other words, in the rabbinic view, the Torah is not an artifactof nature, a product of the universe; the universe, on thecontrary, is the product of the Torah. According to the famousmidrash on the first verses of Genesis:It is customary that when human beings build a palace, theydo not build it according to their own wisdom, but accordingto the wisdom of experts. And the experts do not buildaccording to their own wisdom, rather they have plans andrecords in order to know how to make rooms and corridors.The Holy One did the same. God looked into the Torah andcreated the world. (Bereyshit Rabah:1:1)Far from being a physical book, the Torah, in the rabbinic view,is the blueprint of creation and therefore there is a directcorrelation between the world and Torah. The Torah is not seenas speculation <i>about</i> the world, but part of its very essence.Susan A. Handelman (adapted)A new "learning" is about to be born--rather, it has been born.It is a learning in reverse order. A learning that no longer startsfrom the Torah and leads into life, but the other way round:from life, from a world that knows nothing of the Law, orpretends to know nothing, back to the Torah. That is the signof the time.It is the sign of the time because it is the mark of the men andwomen of the time. There is no one today who is not alienated,who does not have some small fraction of alienation inside. Allof us to whom Judaism, to whom being a Jew, has again becomethe pivot of our lives...we all know that in being Jews we mustnot give up anything, not renounce anything, but leadeverything back to Judaism. From the periphery back to thecenter; from the outside in.This is a new sort of learning. A learning for which--in thesedays--those are the most apt who bring with them themaximum of what is alien. That is to say...they will succeed, notin the capacity of specialists, but only as Jews who are alienated,as those who are groping for the way home.It is not a matter of pointing out relations between what isJewish and what is non-Jewish. There has been enough of that.It is not a matter of apologetics, but rather of finding the wayback into the heart of our life. And of being confident that thisheart is a Jewish heart. For we are Jews.Franz Rosenzweig (translated from the German by Francis C. Goffling [adapted])/KALIFE CYCLE<i>See /MDMi Sheberaḥ</i> section, pages 414, 687-691 for additional life cycle blessings./KAA Blessing(For birth, bar/bat mitzvah)May your eyes sparkle with the light of Torah,and your ears hear the music of its words.May the space between each letter of the scrollsbring warmth and comfort to your soul.May the syllables draw holiness from your heart,and may this holiness be gentle and soothingto the world.May your study be passionate,and meanings bear more meaningsuntil Life itself arrays itself to youas a dazzling wedding feast.And may your conversation,even of the commonplace,be a blessing to all who listen to your wordsand see the Torah glowing on your face.Danny Siegel (Inspired by Talmud Beraḥot 17A)(For bar/bat mitzvah)The days come and go. Imperceptibly our lives change. Wegrow older and are hardly aware of it. Our children grow upand we hardly notice. Then, suddenly, we come to this time andwe realize that our sons and daughters are children no longer.They have become young men and women, ready to take theirfirst step into adulthood.We are grateful that we have been able to bring them this far.We are thankful for the strength to cope with the stresses andresponsibilities of rearing them. And we give thanks for thepleasure and pride we have had in them./PINow we realize they are children no longer. Only another year,two, three, and they will begin to go from our homes to findtheir own way in the world.We ask ourselves, have we truly prepared them for this? Havewe done enough, taught them enough? We are almost afraid tolet them go.Yet it was for this that we raised them, that they might growup to take their places in the world.(For aufruf, engagement, anniversary)We are thankful for  and and for what they mean and bring to each other.We are thankful that a deep need for each other,and the capacity to love and to care for one anotherhas been implanted within them.May they be modest in their demands of one another,and generous in their giving to each other.May they never measure how much love or encouragement theyoffer;may they never count the times they forgive.Rather, may they always be gratefulthat they have one anotherand that they are able to express their lovein acts of kindness.Keep them gentle in their speech.When they offer words of criticism,may they be chosen with care, and spoken softly.May they waste no opportunity to speak words of sympathy,of appreciation, of praise.May they be blessed with health, happiness and contentment.Above all, may they be granted the wisdom to build ajoyous and peaceful home.Sidney Greenberg (adapted)/KAPRELUDES TO KADDISHDirge Without MusicI am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in thehard ground.So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. CrownedWith lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,A formula, a phrase remains, but the best is lost.The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter,the love,They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant andcurledIs the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do notapprove.More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses inthe world.Down, down, down into the darkness of the graveGently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.Edna St. Vincent MillayEach Of Us Has a NameEach of us has a namegiven by Godand given by our parentsEach of us has a namegiven by our stature and our smileand given by what we wearEach of us has a namegiven by the mountainsand given by our wallsEach of us has a namegiven by the starsand given by our neighborsEach of us has a namegiven by our sinsand given by our longingEach of us has a namegiven by our enemiesand given by our loveEach of us has a namegiven by our celebrationsand given by our workEach of us has a namegiven by the seasonsand given by our blindnessEach of us has a namegiven by the seaand given byour death./HYלְכָל אִישׁ יֵשׁ שֵׁםלְכָל אִישׁ יֵשׁ שֵׁםשֶּׁנָּתַן לוֹ אֱלֹהִיםוְּנָתְנוּ לוֹ אָבִיו וְאִמּוֹלְכָל אִישׁ יֵשׁ שֵׁםשֶּׁנָּתְנוּ לוֹ קוֹמָתוֹ וְֽֽֽאֹפֶן חִיּוּכוֹוְנָתַן לוֹ הָאָרִיגלְכָל אִישׁ יֵשׁ שֵׁםשֶּׁנָּתְנוּ לוֹ הֶהָרִיםוְּנָתְנוּ לוֹ כְּתָלָיולְכָל אִישׁ יֵשׁ שֵׁםשֶּׁנָּתְנוּ לוֹ הַמַּזָּלוֹתוְּנָתְנוּ לוֹ שְׁכֵנָיולְכָל אִישׁ יֵשׁ שֵׁםשֶּׁנָּתְנוּ לוֹ חֲטָאָיווְּנָתְנָה לוֹ כְּמִיהָתוֹלְכָל אִישׁ יֵשׁ שֵׁםשֶּׁנָּתְנוּ לוֹ שׂוֹנְאָיווְנָתְנָה לוֹ אַהֲבָתוֹלְכָל אִישׁ יֵשׁ שֵׁםשֶּׁנָּתְנוּ לוֹ חַגָּיווְּנָתְנָה לוֹ מְלַאכְתּוֹלְכָל אִישׁ יֵשׁ שֵׁםשֶּׁנָּתְנוּ לוֹ תְּקוּפוֹת הַשָּׁנָהוְנָתַן לוֹ עִוְרוֹנוֹלְכָל אִישׁ יֵשׁ שֵׁםשֶּׁנָּתַן לוֹ הַיָּםוְנָתַן לוֹמוֹתוֹ:/HNZelda (translated by Marcia Falk)/KAIn Many HousesIn many housesall at onceI see my mother and fatherand they are youngas they walk in.Why should mytears come,to see them laughing?That they cannotsee meis of no matter:I was oncetheir dream:nowthey are mine.Diane ColeTo open eyes when others close themto hear when others do not wish to listento look when others turn awayto seek to understand when others give upto rouse oneself when others acceptto continue the struggle even when one is not the strongestto cry out when others keep silent--to be a Jewit is that,it is first of all thatand furtherto live when others are deadand to remember when others have forgotten.Emmanuel Eydoux (translated from the French by Jonathan Magonet)Connections are made slowly, sometimes they growunderground. You cannot tell always by looking what ishappening. More than half a tree is spread out in the soil underyour feet. Penetrate quietly as the earthworm that blows notrumpet. Fight persistently as the creeper that brings down thetree. Spread like the squash plant that overruns the garden.Gnaw in the dark and use the sun to make sugar.Weave real connections, create real nodes, build real houses. Livea life you can endure: make love that is loving. Keep tanglingand interweaving and taking more in, a thicket and bramblewilderness to the outside but to us interconnected with rabbitruns and burrows and lairs.Live as if you liked yourself, and it may happen: reach out, keepreaching out, keep bringing in. This is how we are going to livefor a long time: not always, for every gardener knows that afterthe digging, after the planting, after the long season of tendingand growth, the harvest comes.Marge Piercy/KABirth is a BeginningBirth is a beginningAnd death a destination.And life is a journey:From childhood to maturityAnd youth to age;From innocence to awarenessAnd ignorance to knowing;From foolishness to discretionAnd then perhaps to wisdom;/PIFrom weakness to strengthOr strength to weakness--And, often back again;From health to sicknessAnd back, we pray, to health again;From offense to forgiveness,From loneliness to love,From joy to gratitude,From pain to compassion,And grief to understanding--From fear to faith;From defeat to defeat to defeat--Until, looking backward or ahead,We see that victory liesNot at some high place along the way,But in having made the journey, stage by stage,A sacred pilgrimage.Birth is a beginningAnd death a destinationBut life is a journey,A sacred pilgrimage--To life everlasting.Alvin I.
