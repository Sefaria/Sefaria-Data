I come into your house./PR

And as for me, my prayer is for you, /SCG/XXENTLE /XXO/XXNE/XX,/PR

may it be for you a time of desire,/PR

/PR

O God, in the abundance of your love,/PR

respond to me in truth with your help./PR

/SCN/XXOTE/XX. The /ITMah Tovu/XX prayer is composed entirely of biblical verses: Num-
bers 24:5; Psalms 5:8, 95:6 [adapted] and 69:14./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. /ITMah Tovu/XX begins with a historical progression--the tents
of our earliest ancestors, then the sanctuary of the years of wandering in
the wilderness, then the Temple in Jerusalem. Each of these is linked to
the synagogue, for it too is "your house." And I, the contemporary soul,
seeking the right moment to encounter the divine there, am thus not
alone. I am a link in the chain of tradition bearing the truth of your
salvation.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. It is only a true and close community that develops associations,
traditions and memories that go to make up its soul. To mingle oneòs per-
sonality with that soul becomes a natural longing. In such a community
one experiences that mystic divine grace which, like radiant sunshine, illu-
mines our lives when joyous and, like balm, heals them when wounded
or stricken. Then all questions about saying this or that become trivial, for
the real purpose is attained in having each one feel with the Psalmist:
"One thing I ask of God that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the
house of God all the days of my life, to behold the graciousness of God."/PR

/SC/XXM.M.K. (ADAPTED)/XX/PR

/PR

 נו / as for me, my prayer is for you. The Hebrew text has often
been creatively misread to mean "I am my prayer." All I have to offer in
prayer is myself. We begin our prayers with a feeling of humility, knowing
that the vaunted words we are about to speak are no greater than the per-
son who speaks them. Most of the prayers in our liturgy are phrased in
the first person plural, in which /ITwe/XX as a community stand before the
Divine presence. But here they are introduced in the halting and some-
what unsure voice of the individual, expressing some of that inadequacy
that each of us feels as we enter the place and hour of prayer.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/KAATIFAT TALLIT / DONNING THE TALLIT/XX/PR

/ITIt is customary to wrap oneself in the tallit before reciting the blessing that follows. After the
blessing is recited, the tallit is placed across the shoulders. In some congregations the blessing
is said in unison./PR

/PR

/SCA/XXBUNDANT /XXO/XXNE/XX, my God, how great you grow!/PR

/PR

Blessed are You, /SCV/XXEILED /XXO/XXNE/XX, our God, the sovereign of all
worlds, who has made us holy with your mitzvot, and
commanded us to wrap ourselves amid the fringed tallit./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. According to rabbinic tradition, Psalm 104:1-2 describes
how God, robed in splendor, wrapped in light, began to create the world.
The radiance of Godòs light-robe (one source says that God donned a white
tallit) illumined the world before the creation of sun, moon, and stars. This
meditation invites the worshipper to consider the act of donning the tallit
to be the first step in the daily renewal of the world. Godòs wrapping in
light becomes Israelòs enlightened wrapping at the outset of a new day. It
encourages Israel to celebrate world renewing creativity as an unfailing
sign of the divine presence within humankind.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. The tallit is a very personal ritual object. Usually I wrap it around
myself when joining in a prayer community. For the tallit both creates a
private space for me and links me with Jewish tradition. It emphasizes my
connection to my people while also offering me spiritual privacy. I am
alone and in community at the same time.    /SC/XXL.B./XX/PR

their theological outlooks and ethical concerns. At any place where a bless-

alternative formulas for /ITberah/±ot/XX. This can be done by selecting one phrase

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. The tallit is a "garment of brightness." It links us with the whole
universe, with the whole of Nature. The blue thread within it (Numbers
15:37-41) reminds us that heaven and earth can touch, that the elements
of our universe are all wondrously connected.    /SC/XXL.B./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The wearing of the tallit has its origins in the biblical com-
mandment (Numbers 15:37-41) that a fringe should be attached to each
corner of a garment to remind the Israelites of the mitzvot. This garment,
resembling a poncho, was the basic garment worn every day. When cloth-
ing without such defined corners came to be customary, the tallit became
a special ritual garment. In our time, a large tallit is worn only during the
morning prayer, while traditional Jews wear a small tallit, also known as
/ITarba kanfot/XX / four corners, underneath their outer clothes. In the biblical
commandment the fringe was a color called  / /ITteh/±elet/XX, a particular
shade of purple-blue. When this was no longer available, the rabbis ruled
that the fringes should be an undyed white. Some contemporary Jews have
reinstituted the inclusion of blue in the fringe. Today in Reconstructionist
congregations, women are encouraged to wear tallitot as well./PR

ךו בב / My heartòs a place for you, as you are mine. The journey to
God is a journey inward rather than upward. We think more easily of a
God who dwells within the human soul than we do of one in the sky or
on a mountain. Here the poet reminds us that while God is indeed in us,
we are also "inside" God. The Hebrew word /ITmakom/XX or "place" is one of
our ancient names for the divine. "God is the place of the world," said the
rabbis, "but the world is not Godòs place," meaning that the divine cannot
be contained within the finite. In the spirit of this poem, we might choose
to say that the inwardness with which we seek God and the inwardness
with which the divine seeks us is the same inwardness.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR
