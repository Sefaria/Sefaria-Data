/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. Public worship aids us by liberating personality from the con-
fining walls of the individual ego. Imprisoned in self, we easily fall prey
to morbid brooding. Interference with career, personal disappointment and
disillusionment, hurts to vanity, the fear of death--all these tend so to
dominate our attention that our minds move in a fixed and narrow system
of ideas, which we detest but from which we see no escape. With a whole
wide world of boundless opportunities about us, we permit our minds, as
it were, to pace up and down within the narrow cell of their ego-prisons.
But participation in public worship breaks through the prison of the ego
and lets in the light and air of the world. Instead of living but one small
and petty life, we now share the multitudinous life of our people. Against
the wider horizons that now open to our ken, personal cares do not loom
so large. Life becomes infinitely more meaningful and worthwhile when
we become aware, through our participation in public worship, of a com-
mon life that transcends our individual selves.    /SC/XXM.M.K. (ADAPTED)/PR

Blessed are you, /SCE/XXTERNAL /XXO/XXNE/XX, our God, sovereign of all worlds,
by whose word the evenings fall. In wisdom you open heavenòs
gates. With divine discernment you make seasons change,
causing the times to come and go, and ordering the stars on their
appointed paths through heavenòs dome, all according to your
will. Creator of the day and night, who rolls back light before
the dark, and dark before the light, who makes day pass away
and brings on night, dividing between day and night: The
Leader of the Multitudes of Heaven is your name! Living and
enduring God, rule over us, now and always. Blessed are you,
/SCA/XXLMIGHTY /XXO/XXNE/XX, who makes the evenings fall./PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. When we are about to say: "Blessed are you, our God, sovereign
of all worlds," and prepare to utter the first word "blessed," we should do
so with all our strength, so that we will have no strength left to say, "are
you." And this is the meaning of the verse in the Scriptures: "But they
that wait for God shall exchange their strength." What we are really say-
ing is: "Source of life, I am giving you all the strength that is within me
in that very first word; now will you, in exchange, give me an abundance
of new strength, so that I can go on with my prayer."    /SC/XXM.B. (ADAPTED)/XX/PR

םבר בר ורבב ר / by whose word the evenings fall. The word plays
a central role in the Jewish imagination. Our liturgy fantasizes that God
brings on evening each night by saying "Evening!" Thus we repeat each
day the original act of Creation that took place by means of the divine
word. It is only because we affirm a God who so values language that we
feel ourselves able to use words in prayer. Our word, perhaps like Godòs,
gives expression to a depth that goes beyond language, but that can be
shared only though the symbolic power of speech.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The two /ITberah/±ot/XX which precede the Shema set the stage for
its evening recitation. The first /ITberah/±ah/XX praises God for the wonders of
creation that are visible at twilight: the shifting pattern of the stars, the
rhythm of the seasons, the regular passage from day to night. All of these
are a nightly reminder of the unchanging plan of creation./PR

/PR

The second /ITberah/±ah/XX praises God, whose instruction is a special token of
love for Israel. Israel responds by meditating upon Godòs teaching "day
and night," "when we lie down and when we rise." This phrasing recalls
the preceding /ITberah/±ah/XX, adding Israelòs study of Torah to the natural order:
The sun sets, the stars shine, and Israel studies--as regularly as day and
night. The phrase "when we lie down and when we rise" anticipates the
Shema, which follows. This interplay between the /ITberah/±ot/XX and the Shema
suggests that the Shema is Israelòs morning and evening Torah study. At
the same time, it is Israelòs declaration of the oneness of the power that
makes for the natural order and for learning, for creation and human
creativity.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/KAINTERPRETIVE VERSION: ASHER BIDVARO/XX/PR

Praised are you, God, ruler of the universe, who has ordained
the rhythm of life. The day with its light calls to activity and
exertion. But when the day wanes, when, with the setting of
the sun, colors fade, we cease from our labors and welcome the
tranquility of the night. The subdued light of the moon and
stars, the darkness and the stillness about us invite rest and
repose. Trustfully we yield to the quiet of sleep, for we know
that, while we are unaware of what goes on within and around
us, our powers of body and mind are renewed. Therefore, at this
evening hour, we seek composure of spirit. We give thanks for
the day and its tasks and for the night and its rest. Praised are
you, God, who brings on the evening./PR

With everlasting love, you love the house of Israel. Torah and

mode ("Your love will never depart from us.") rather than the imperative
("Never remove your love from us!"). Divine love is unconditional. It is
available to every one of us when we fashion our lives into channels to
receive and share it. The Jewish people together experience that eternal
love as reflected in our love for the study of Torah--a wisdom lovingly
received, shared, and passed on enriched by each generation.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The traditional wording of Biblical Selection II presents
detailed bountiful or devastating consequences of Israelòs collective rela-
tionship to the mitzvot. This biblical section (Deuteronomy 11:13-21)
offers a supernatural theology that many contemporary Jews find difficult.

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. The traditional second paragraph of the Shema (Deuteronomy
11:13-21) offers an account of the natural process by which the blessings
of God themselves lead to pride, self-satisfaction, and ingratitude on the
part of those who receive them. Ironically, the more we are blessed, so it
seems, the less grateful and aware of blessing we become. It is when we
are most sated, Scripture warns us, that we should be most careful. Fullness
can lead to ingratitude, and ingratitude to idolatry--primarily in the form
of worship of our own accomplishments. Then, indeed, "the heavens
might close up and no rain fall." For, once we begin to worship our
achievements, we will never find satisfaction.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

So place these words upon your heart, into your lifebreath. Bind
them as a sign upon your hand, and let them rest before your
eyes. Teach them to your children, speaking of them when you
sit at home, and when you walk upon the road, when you lie
down, and when you rise. Inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates--so that your days and your childrenòs
days be many on the land /SCT/XXHE /XXF/XXAITHFUL /XXO/XXNE/XX promised to give

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The statement of Godòs oneness unifies not only the con-
text of Shema but the text as well--three scriptural paragraphs specified
in the Mishnah (a second century codification of Jewish law). The power-
ful declaration of Godòs unity fuses the responsibility to love God and to
study Godòs teachings (first paragraph) with the lesson that their fulfill-
ment confirms Godòs presence (second and third paragraphs). Hence, the
unity of God as idea and presence.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. In the ancient Near East, free people wore fringes, or
/ITtzitzit/XX, on the hems of their everyday clothes. Since only free people wore
/ITtzitzit/XX, they were a form of identification. Business transactions were sealed
by kissing the /ITtzitzit/XX./PR

The mitzvah of /ITtzitzit/XX is based on that ancient sign of freedom. The fringes
remind us that we voluntarily follow the way of God, who freed us from
Egyptian slavery. It is, literally, a string tied around our finger.    /SC/XXL.W.K./XX/PR

םר / /ITMitzrayim/XX was the escaping Hebrewsò, not the Egyptiansò, name for
the land of Egypt: perhaps a slave-term, and probably not of Semitic ori-
gin, it has associations with the root רר, to be in distress, constricted, in
anguish, or in dire straits. This word powerfully evokes the choking
oppression of slavery. As the psalmist wrote:  ר ר ן / From the
