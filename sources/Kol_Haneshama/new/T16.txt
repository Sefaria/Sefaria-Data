PESUKEY DEZIMRAH/VERSES OF PRAISE/HNHalleluyah!Hail! THE OMNIPRESENT from the heavens,praise God in the heights,sing out your praises, all you angels,praise God, all you multitudes,give praise to God, you sun and moon,praise God, all you stars of lightpraise God, heavens upon heavens,and you, the waters up above the heavens!Let all praise the name of THE ETERNAL,who commanded, and all things became,who raised them up forever and an aeon,who affixed a limit none could pass./PIC<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The stanzas in this psalm outline its organization. First, agroup of lines directed to heavenly beings; second, a group of lines directedto terrestrial beings; and finally, a shorter group of concluding lines thatbuild up to a climactic focus on Israel, God's faithful people who areenjoined to praise God. The liturgy's poetic structure provides a map ofreligious experience. Psalms like this one reveal that Israel's religious expe-rience derives from seeing itself as the center and apogee of God's world.This psalm poses a challenge to contemporary Jewish spirituality: to recon-cile the special heritage of Judaism with our awareness of living in a non--hierarchical world of many centers.    H.L./HY	ּהַלְלוּ אֶת-יהוה מִן-הַשָּֽֽֽׁמַיִם	הַלְֽֽֽלוּהוּ בַּמְּרוֹמִים:	ּהַלְֽֽֽלוּהוּ כָל-מַלְאָכָיו	הַלְֽֽֽלוּהוּ כָּל-צְבָאָיו:	ּהַלְֽֽֽלוּהוּ ֽֽֽשֶׁמֶשׁ וְיָֽֽֽרֵחַ	הַלְֽֽֽלוּהוּ כָּל-כּוֹכְבֵי אוֹר:	ּהַלְֽֽֽלוּהוּ שְׁמֵי הַשָּֽֽֽׁמָיִם	וְהַֽֽֽמָּיִם אֲשֶׁר מֵעַל הַשָּֽֽֽׁמָיִם:	ּיְהַלְלוּ אֶת-שֵׁם יהוה	כִּי הוּא צִוָּה וְנִבְֽֽֽרָאוּ:	ּוַיַּעֲמִידֵם לָעַד לְעוֹלָם	חָק-נָתַן וְלֹא יַעֲבוֹר:PּH/HNC<small>OMMENTARY</small>. This psalm and the tradition it represents stand as animportant counterweight to the first chapter in Genesis. That chaptergives us the impression that humans are separate from the world aroundus, we alone having been created in God's image as "the crown of cre-ation." Here we see a different vision. The human community is an inte-gral part of the natural realm. "You young men, and you maidens, elderssitting with the young," sing and dance before the Lord as do mountainsand hills, fruit trees and cedars.    A.G.Give praise to THE ALL-POWERFUL throughout the earth,you dragons and torrential depths,you fire and hail and snow, and smoke,you raging wind, all acting by God's word,you mountains, all you hills,you fruit trees, bearing every seed,you wild animals, and every beast,you creeping thing, and bird of wing,you rulers of the earth, and all the nations,nobles, and you judges of the land,you young men, and you maidens,elders sitting with the young!Let all bless the name of THE ETERNALfor God's name alone is to be exalted.God's majesty is in the earth and heavens,God has raised the fortunes of our people,praises for the fervent ones,for Israel's children, people near to God,Halleluyah!Psalm 148/HY	ּהַלְלוּ אֶת-יהוה מִן-הָֽֽֽאָרֶץ	תַּנִּינִים וְכָל-תְּהֹמוֹת:	ּאֵשׁ וּבָרָד ֽֽֽשֶׁלֶג וְקִיטוֹר	ֽֽֽרוּחַ סְעָרָה עֹשֶׂה דְבָרוֹ:	ּהֶהָרִים וְכָל-גְּבָעוֹת	עֵץ פְּרִי וְכָל-אֲרָזִים:	ּהַחַיָּה וְכָל-בְּהֵמָה	ֽֽֽרֶמֶשׂ וְצִפּוֹר כָּנָף:	ּמַלְכֵי-ֽֽֽאֶרֶץ וְכָל-לְאֻמִּים	שָׂרִים וְכָל-שֹׁפְטֵי ֽֽֽאָרֶץ:	ּבַּחוּרִים וְגַם-בְּתוּלוֹת	זְקֵנִים עִם-נְעָרִים:	ּיְהַלְלוּ אֶת-שֵׁם יהוה	כִּי-נִשְׂגָּב שְׁמוֹ לְבַדּוֹ	ּהוֹדוּ עַל-ֽֽֽאֶרֶץ וְשָֽֽֽׁמָיִם:	ּ*וַֽֽֽיָּרֶם ֽֽֽקֶרֶן לְעַמּוֹ	תְּהִלָּה לְכָל-חֲסִידָיו	לִבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל עַם קְרֹבוֹ:/HNHallelu/Yah!Call out to Yah in Heaven's holy place!Boom out to Yah across the firmament!Shout out for Yah, for all God's mighty deeds!Cry out for Yah, as loud as God is great!Blast out for Yah with piercing shofar note!Pluck out for Yah with lute and violin!Throb out for Yah with drum and writhing dance!Sing out for Yah with strings and husky flute!Ring out for Yah with cymbals that resound!Clang out for Yah with cymbals that rebound!Let every living thing Yah's praises sing, Hallelu/Yah!Let every living thing Yah's praises sing, Hallelu/Yah!Psalm 150Blessed is THE ONE eternally.Amen!

Amen!C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Psalm 150 as it appears in the biblical text does not repeatits concluding line as it does in the liturgy. The repetition here makes thisconcluding verse parallel to all the preceding ones, allowing it to fit a vari-ety of musical settings. The repetition also emphasizes the psalm's essentialmessage.

The mean-ing of the Hebrew phrase is rich in ambiguity. All earth is filled withdivine glory, but divine glory itself is filled up with earthliness. It is thereality of this world that fills God's presence, as it is the presence thatgives the world its glory.    A.G.ןמאו...ךורב / Blessed...Amen! (Psalms 89:53, 135:21, 72:18-19)./KAINTERPRETIVE NISHMAT KOL ḤAYWhen the night slides under with the last dimming starand the red sky lightens between the trees,and the heron glides tipping heavy wings in the river,when crows stir and cry out their harsh joy,and swift creatures of the night run toward their burrows,and the deer raises her head and sniffs the freshening air,and the shadows grow more distinct and then shorten,then we rise into the day still clean as new snow.The cat washes its paw and greets the day with gratitude.Leviathan salutes breaching with a column of steam.The hawk turning in the sky cries out a prayer like a knife.We must wonder at the sky now thin as a speckled eggshell,that now piles up its boulders of storm to crash down,that now hangs a furry grey belly into the street.Every day we find a new sky and a new earthwith which we are trusted like a perfect toy.We are given the salty river of our bloodwinding through us, to remember the sea and ourkindred under the waves, the hot pulsing that knocksin our throats to consider our cousins in the grassand the trees, all bright scattered rivulets of life.We are given the wind within us, the breathto shape into words that steal time, that touchlike hands and pierce like bullets, that wakentruth and deceit, sorrow and pity and joy,that waste precious air in complaints, in lies,in floating traps for power on the dirty air.Yet holy breath still stretches our lungs to sing./PIWe are given the body, that momentary kibbutzof elements that have belonged to frog and polarbear, corn and oak tree, volcano and glacier.We are lent for a time these minerals in waterand a morning every day, a morning to wake up,rejoice and praise life in our spines, our throats,our knees, our genitals, our brains, our tongues.We are given fire to see against the dark,to think, to read, to study how we are to live,to bank in ourselves against defeat and despairthat cool and muddy our resolves, that make us forgetwhat we saw we must do. We are given passionto rise like the sun in our minds with the new dayand burn the debris of habit and greed and fear.We stand in the midst of the burning worldprimed to burn with compassionate love and justice,to turn inward and find holy fire at the core,to turn outward and see the world that is allof one flesh with us, see under the trash, throughthe smog, the furry bee in the apple blossom,the trout leaping, the candles our ancestors lit for us.Fill us as the tide rustles into the reeds in the marsh.Fill us as the rushing water overflows the pitcher.Fill us as light fills a room with its dancing.Let the little quarrels of the bones and the snarlingof the lesser appetites and the whining of the ego cease.Let silence still us so you may show us your shiningand we can out of that stillness rise and praise.Marge PiercyThe soul of every living thing shall bless your name, ETERNALONE, our God, the spirit of all flesh shall glorify and hold inreverence continually the memory of you, our sovereign one.From one eternity to another, you alone are God. For withoutyou, we have no ruler, no redeemer, none to champion our cause,none to rescue or to save, none to nourish or to nurture us,whatever be the hour, or the trouble, or the need./PIC<small>OMMENTARY.</small> <i>Nishmat Kol Ḥay</i> consists of three sections. The first section presents God'sunity as that unity is declared with every breath of creation. The secondsection gives thanks for timely rains and declares God to be beyondcreation's collective ability to praise. Even if we could enlist nature's great-est capacities in the service of praising God, they would still fall short.Praise "as great as all outdoors" is still inadequate.In the third section of <i>Nishmat Kol Ḥay</i>, Israel's unique praises reflect itshistorical experiences of God as the power that brings redemption. NishmatKol Ḥay begins with a universal chorus of praise, moves to the particularpraise of Israel, and then speaks of the many ways that individual actionsserve as praise. Praises arise from the universe <i>within</i> the self just as theyfill the universe <i>without</i>. Verses from the Psalms illustrate aspects of bodyand breath/soul contributing praises that fill worlds.<i>Pesukey Dezimrah</i> ends with this rabbinic composition reassembling indi-vidual voices into a chorus of adoration and thanksgiving. The final para-graphs are a reprise of the first blessing of <i>Pesukey Dezimrah</i> in BaruḥShe'amar (page 177). Thus, the entire collection beginning with BaruḥShe'amar and ending before the Kaddish (which separates PesukeyDezimrah from <i>Shaḥarit</i>) becomes a well defined literary whole.    S.S.Nishmat is the song of the waveawakening to the ocean,seeing that the wave is the ocean and the ocean the wave,recognizing the interdependence of all things anddiscovering the awesome wonder that is our reality.    R.M.S./HYנִּשְׁמַת כָּל-חַי תְּבָרֵךְ אֶת-שִׁמְךָ יהוה אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ וְֽֽֽרוּחַ כָּל-בָּשָׂר תְּפָאֵרּוּתְרוֹמֵם זִכְרְךָ מַלְֽֽֽכֵּנוּ תָּמִיד מִן-הָעוֹלָם וְעַד-הָעוֹלָם אַתָּה אֵל.ּוּמִבַּלְעָֽֽֽדֶיךָ אֵין ֽֽֽלָנוּ ֽֽֽמֶלֶךְ גּוֹאֵל וּמוֹֽֽֽשִׁיעַ פּוֹדֶה וּמַצִּיל וּמְפַרְנֵס וּמְרַחֵםּבְּכָל-עֵת צָרָה וְצוּקָה אֵין ֽֽֽלָנוּ ֽֽֽמֶלֶךְ אֶלָּא ֽֽֽאָתָּה:PּH/HNNishmat kol ḥay tevareḥ et shimeḥa adonay elo<u>hey</u>nu.D<small>ERASH</small>. <i>Nefesh, ruaḥ, neshamah:</i> these three Hebrew terms are often trans-lated as soul or spirit. They were originally terms for breath. This relationbetween soul and breathing is found in other sacred languages as well:<i>atman</i> in Sanskrit, <i>pneuma</i> in Greek, <i>anima</i> and <i>spiritus</i> in Latin are all termsfor soul. All in origin refer to breath and breathing. Literally, then, thisprayer asserts that the breath of all living creatures proclaims God's bless-ing. In what sense might this be so?Breath is the prerequisite of life and speech, of existence and communica-tion, and it is a gift requiring no conscious attention except in cases ofillness. If each inhalation required a direct order, each exhalation a con-scious command, how should we find energy or attention for anythingelse? How should we sleep? In truth, we do not breathe; we are breathed.At this moment of my writing, at this moment of your reading, at succeed-ing moments of our praying, breath enters and leaves our lungs withoutour conscious intervention. Truly we are breathed.    E.G.יח לכ תמשנ / The soul of every living thing. This ancient and grandrabbinic closing to the morning psalms follows the biblical view thatrefuses to make any distinction between matter and spirit. God is thebreath that resides in all of life, the spirit that animates all flesh. It is thiscorporeal world that is the locus of divinity. We need only develop theeyes to see it.    A.G.God of the first things and the last, the deity of every creature,power over all that comes to be, the subject of all praises throughthe multitude of laudatory songs, who guides the universe inlove, all creatures with compassion. THE WATCHFUL ONE willnever slumber, never sleep! To you who wakens all who sleepand stirs all those who slumber, who gives speech to those whocannot speak, who frees the captive and upholds the falling, whomakes upright those bent down--to you alone we offer thanks.And were our mouths oceans of song, our tongues alive withexultation like the waters' waves, our lips filled full of praiseslike the heaven's dome, our eyes lit up like sun and moon, ourhands spread out like eagle's wings, our feet as light as those ofthe gazelle--we would never have sufficient praise for you,A<small>BUNDANT </small>O<small>NE</small>, our God, God of our ancestors, nor could webless your name enough for even one small measure of thethousands upon thousands of the times of goodness, when youacted for our ancestors and us./PIC<small>OMMENTARY</small>. This passage invokes Creation--the separation of sky andwater, the fixing of the heavenly lights, the creation of winged creaturesand fleet-footed animals. The poet imagines human beings with the bestqualities of all the rest of creation. Even then our most elaborate praiseswould not suffice to express the immensity of the blessing we receive. Weare therefore urged to honor our good fortune in God's creative powerwith every organ of our bodies and with every imaginable verbalvariation--that is all we can do in the face of the multiplicity of God'swonders.

Our faith awakens usfrom the sleep of our unawareness and calls us to release the bound, toraise up the fallen, and to uplift those who are bent over. In this we aredoing godly work, serving as the limbs of the divine presence in thisworld. It is only through our acting in this way that God's work is donein the human community. And it is only by recognizing such acts as God'swork that we transcend ourselves and our own needs in fulfilling them.<small>A.G.</small>From Egypt you redeemed us, ANCIENT ONE, our God, andfrom the house of servitude you rescued us. When we werehungry, you provided us with food. With satisfaction you havenurtured us, and from the sword you have delivered us, andduring pestilence you gave us refuge, and from dreadful andpersistent sicknesses you've set us free. Down to the present day,your kindnesses have been a help to us, your loving acts havenot forsaken us.So never more abandon us, FOUNT OF COMPASSION.Therefore, the limbs that you have molded for us, breath andspirit you have breathed into our nostrils, tongue that you haveplaced into our mouths--behold, they shall give thanks, andbless, and praise, and glorify, exalt, admire, sanctify, and crownyour name our sovereign power. For every mouth will offerthanks to you, each tongue swear oath; each knee will bend,each upright body will bow down; and every heart will be inawe of you, and every inner organ sing out to your name--as itis written: "Let all my bones declare: THE INFINITE! Who is likeyou? You, who save the poor from those of greater strength, thedestitute and the oppressed from their exploiters." The wail ofthe downtrodden you will hear, and to the cry of theunfortunate you hearken and come forth with help. Whoresembles you, who can be your equal, who can estimate yourworth?

Focus on the imagery of the body that weaves through thissection of the liturgy: Breath. Flesh. Mouths. Tongues. Lips. Eyes. Hands.Feet. Limbs. Soul. Tongue. Mouth. Hearts. Bones. Soul. The rabbiniccomposers of the liturgy have given us here explicit directions for how weare to pray: with all our heart, and all our soul, and all our bodilymight.

It is the whole self that callsout the praises of God, not just the lips or the mind. The act of prayer isone that calls upon the entire person. This is why traditional Jewish prayermay involve the rhythmic swaying of the body. There is preserved in thisancient and largely unconscious movement an element of ritual dance inwhich bodily movement was joined to speech in calling out God'sglory.    A.G.We hail you, and we praise you, and we glorify you, and webless your holy name, as it is said by David: "Bless, O my soul,T<small>HE </small>O<small>NE</small>, and all my inner strength, God's holy name."<i>On Pilgrimage Festivals the /MDnusaḥ</i> shifts here.

The word <i>olam</i> can refer either to space or to time.A God who is "the life of the <i>olamim</i>" can be one who lives eternally, onewho inhabits all of many worlds, or one who joins space and time together.Space and time are the two essential categories that are sanctified by reli-gion. Our tradition declares both certain times and particular places to beespecially holy. It is through our reverence for these that we learn to treatlife as a whole with the reverence of <i>kedushah</i>. It is our understanding ofGod as <i>ḥey ha'olamim</i> that cuts through the distinction between space andtime and binds them together in cosmic oneness.

David was anointed as rulerover Israel by Samuel, according to I Samuel 16. Anointment, the pouringof olive oil over the head of a chosen leader of Israel, was a symbol ofelevation to kingship. Eventually, "Anointed One" (<i>mashiaḥ</i>) came to referto <i>the</i> Messiah, the descendant of King David who would rule Israel andthe world at the End of Days. The rule of David, at least for the peopleof the southern kingdom, Judah, symbolized an idyllic time of unity andsovereignty in Israel. Belief in a Messiah became more intense whenIsrael's unity and sovereignty ended. Here, the term refers simply to theanointing event in David's lifetime.    J.R.לארשי...ומע / your people...Israel. This prayer delights in God's love for the Jewish people. To say that this people is beloved of God, however, is not to assert that we are the only beloved of god. When we are fully aware of the divine love, we also recognize that infinite love can equally embrace all peoples of the world in their uniqueness.
