/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The stanzas in this psalm outline its organization. First, a
group of lines directed to heavenly beings; second, a group of lines directed
to terrestrial beings; and finally, a shorter group of concluding lines that
build up to a climactic focus on Israel, Godòs faithful people who are
enjoined to praise God. The liturgyòs poetic structure provides a map of
religious experience. Psalms like this one reveal that Israelòs religious expe-
rience derives from seeing itself as the center and apogee of Godòs world.
This psalm poses a challenge to contemporary Jewish spirituality: to recon-
cile the special heritage of Judaism with our awareness of living in a non--
hierarchical world of many centers.    /SC/XXH.L./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This psalm and the tradition it represents stand as an
important counterweight to the first chapter in Genesis. That chapter
gives us the impression that humans are separate from the world around
us, we alone having been created in Godòs image as "the crown of cre-
ation." Here we see a different vision. The human community is an inte-
gral part of the natural realm. "You young men, and you maidens, elders
sitting with the young," sing and dance before the Lord as do mountains
and hills, fruit trees and cedars.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Psalm 150 as it appears in the biblical text does not repeat
its concluding line as it does in the liturgy. The repetition here makes this
concluding verse parallel to all the preceding ones, allowing it to fit a vari-
ety of musical settings. The repetition also emphasizes the psalmòs essential
message.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

ing of the Hebrew phrase is rich in ambiguity. All earth is filled with
divine glory, but divine glory itself is filled up with earthliness. It is the

gives the world its glory.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

The soul of every living thing shall bless your name, /SCE/XXTERNAL
/XXO/XXNE/XX, our God, the spirit of all flesh shall glorify and hold in
reverence continually the memory of you, our sovereign one.
From one eternity to another, you alone are God. For without
you, we have no ruler, no redeemer, none to champion our cause,
none to rescue or to save, none to nourish or to nurture us,
whatever be the hour, or the trouble, or the need./PI/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY./XX /ITNishmat Kol H/±ay/XX consists of three sections. The first section presents Godòs
unity as that unity is declared with every breath of creation. The second
section gives thanks for timely rains and declares God to be beyond
creationòs collective ability to praise. Even if we could enlist natureòs great-
est capacities in the service of praising God, they would still fall short.
Praise "as great as all outdoors" is still inadequate./PR

/PR

In the third section of /ITNishmat Kol H/±ay/XX, Israelòs unique praises reflect its
historical experiences of God as the power that brings redemption. /ITNishmat
Kol H/±ay/XX begins with a universal chorus of praise, moves to the particular
praise of Israel, and then speaks of the many ways that individual actions
serve as praise. Praises arise from the universe /ITwithin/XX the self just as they
fill the universe /ITwithout/XX. Verses from the Psalms illustrate aspects of body
and breath/soul contributing praises that fill worlds./PR

/ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX ends with this rabbinic composition reassembling indi-
vidual voices into a chorus of adoration and thanksgiving. The final para-
graphs are a reprise of the first blessing of /ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX in /ITBaruh/±
Sheòamar/XX (page 177). Thus, the entire collection beginning with /ITBaruh/±
Sheòamar/XX and ending before the Kaddish (which separates /ITPesukey
Dezimrah/XX from /ITShah/±arit/XX) becomes a well defined literary whole.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. /ITNefesh, ruah/±, neshamah:/XX these three Hebrew terms are often trans-
lated as soul or spirit. They were originally terms for breath. This relation
between soul and breathing is found in other sacred languages as well:
/ITatman/XX in Sanskrit, /ITpneuma/XX in Greek, /ITanima/XX and /ITspiritus/XX in Latin are all terms
for soul. All in origin refer to breath and breathing. Literally, then, this
prayer asserts that the breath of all living creatures proclaims Godòs bless-
ing. In what sense might this be so?/PR

/PR

Breath is the prerequisite of life and speech, of existence and communica-
tion, and it is a gift requiring no conscious attention except in cases of
illness. If each inhalation required a direct order, each exhalation a con-
scious command, how should we find energy or attention for anything
else? How should we sleep? In truth, we do not breathe; we are breathed.
At this moment of my writing, at this moment of your reading, at succeed-
ing moments of our praying, breath enters and leaves our lungs without
our conscious intervention. Truly we are breathed.    /SC/XXE.G./XX/PR

/PR

יח לכ תמשנ / The soul of every living thing. This ancient and grand
rabbinic closing to the morning psalms follows the biblical view that
refuses to make any distinction between matter and spirit. God is the
breath that resides in all of life, the spirit that animates all flesh. It is this
corporeal world that is the locus of divinity. We need only develop the
eyes to see it.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/PG236/XX/PR

God of the first things and the last, the deity of every creature,
power over all that comes to be, the subject of all praises through
the multitude of laudatory songs, who guides the universe in
love, all creatures with compassion. /SCT/XXHE /XXW/XXATCHFUL /XXO/XXNE/XX will
never slumber, never sleep! To you who wakens all who sleep
and stirs all those who slumber, who gives speech to those who
cannot speak, who frees the captive and upholds the falling, who
makes upright those bent down--to you alone we offer thanks./PR

/PR

And were our mouths oceans of song, our tongues alive with
exultation like the watersò waves, our lips filled full of praises
like the heavenòs dome, our eyes lit up like sun and moon, our
hands spread out like eagleòs wings, our feet as light as those of
the gazelle--we would never have sufficient praise for you,
/SCA/XXBUNDANT /XXO/XXNE/XX, our God, God of our ancestors, nor could we
bless your name enough for even one small measure of the
thousands upon thousands of the times of goodness, when you
acted for our ancestors and us./PI/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This passage invokes Creation--the separation of sky and
water, the fixing of the heavenly lights, the creation of winged creatures
and fleet-footed animals. The poet imagines human beings with the best
qualities of all the rest of creation. Even then our most elaborate praises
would not suffice to express the immensity of the blessing we receive. We
are therefore urged to honor our good fortune in Godòs creative power
with every organ of our bodies and with every imaginable verbal
variation--that is all we can do in the face of the multiplicity of Godòs
wonders.    /SC/XXR.S./XX/PR

out the praises of God, not just the lips or the mind. The act of prayer is
one that calls upon the entire person. This is why traditional Jewish prayer
may involve the rhythmic swaying of the body. There is preserved in this
ancient and largely unconscious movement an element of ritual dance in
which bodily movement was joined to speech in calling out Godòs
glory.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

םימלועה יח / who lives eternally. The Hebrew phrase literally means life of
the worlds. This prayerbook also uses the rich and ambiguous phrase for
the morning blessings. The word /ITolam/XX can refer either to space or to time.
A God who is "the life of the /ITolamim/XX" can be one who lives eternally, one
who inhabits all of many worlds, or one who joins space and time together.
Space and time are the two essential categories that are sanctified by reli-
gion. Our tradition declares both certain times and particular places to be
especially holy. It is through our reverence for these that we learn to treat
life as a whole with the reverence of /ITkedushah/XX. It is our understanding of
God as /ITh/±ey haòolamim/XX that cuts through the distinction between space and
time and binds them together in cosmic oneness.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

ךחישמ ךדבע / your servant...your anointed one. David was anointed as ruler
over Israel by Samuel, according to I Samuel 16. Anointment, the pouring
of olive oil over the head of a chosen leader of Israel, was a symbol of
elevation to kingship. Eventually, "Anointed One" (/ITmashiah/±/XX) came to refer
to /ITthe/XX Messiah, the descendant of King David who would rule Israel and
the world at the End of Days. The rule of David, at least for the people
of the southern kingdom, Judah, symbolized an idyllic time of unity and
sovereignty in Israel. Belief in a Messiah became more intense when
Israelòs unity and sovereignty ended. Here, the term refers simply to the
anointing event in Davidòs lifetime.    /SC/XXJ.R./XX/PR

לארשי...ומע / your people...Israel. This prayer delights in Godòs love for the Jewish people. To say that this people is beloved of God, however, is not to assert that we are the only beloved of god.
