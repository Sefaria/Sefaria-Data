ALTERNATIVE SHONOT/HN/KAAMIDAH MEDITATIONSThese meditations (pages 726-729) are alternatives to theShabbat <i>Amidah</i>. Traditionally recited thrice daily, the <i>Amidah</i>originally served as a time for meditation. That path isinaccessible to many of us. These meditations are intended torestore it. They can be self-guided or leader-directed. Leadersmight guide a whole congregation or groups as small as two orthree. Leadership can be rotated.In meditating with a leader/guide, participants are led by theguide's voice. If the leader moves too quickly for you, move atyour own pace, allowing your mind to carry you until you areagain in step with the leader. In meditating without aleader/guide, select a meditation and read the instructions. Thenclose your eyes and sit comfortably, with both feet on theground, hands resting loosely in your lap. Take a few deepbreaths, then begin the meditation. Be careful not to let yourthoughts wander--if they do, bring them back by taking a fewdeep breaths. Proceed at your own pace. Do not hurry. Whenyou have completed one meditation, feel free to begin another.A single meditation, or up to three, might serve as the <i>Amidah</i>./KA1. AVOTThink about the people to whom you answer....Who is yourinner "board of directors"?...Who is it you are serving in yourlife?...Who are your Abrahams, Isaacs, Jacobs, your Sarahs,Rebekahs, Rachels and Leahs?...Don't struggle with the voicesor engage them in any way....Simply acknowledge them....Invitethem into your Shabbat....Feel at one with them./KA2. GEVUROTThink of a part of your present life--a personality, relationship,or situation--that feels stagnant to you....Something isn't right.It isn't growing.

What was butmoments ago the substance of our life has now become itsmemory, and what we did must now be woven into who we are.On this day we shall not do, but be; we are to walk the outerlimits of our humanity, no longer ride unseeing through a worldwe only vaguely sense beneath our cushioned wheels. On thisday heat and warmth and light must come from deep withinourselves; no longer can we tear apart the world to make ourfire. On this day, but a breath away from our creation , we areto breathe in a world from which we may no longer feel apart,but as close as eye to blossom, and ear to the singing in thenight. On this day we must open wide the windows behindwhich we have hidden from the world, and send forth hand andheart to learn where we have come, and what we have become.Richard Levy (adapted)#We come together on this Shabbat, each bringing to this sanctu-ary a private world of hopes, of fears, of dreams. Some of us areburdened by anxieties and cares that all but crush our faith in thefuture. Others have hearts filled with happiness, grateful for thejoys of the past week, yet aware that even the most fortunate arevulnerable before the mystery of tomorrow. Every life is a uniqueblending of joy and sorrow, of fulfillment and frustration.Beneath our uniqueness we are all bound together by ourcommon humanity. All of us most deeply yearn for the blessingsof freedom and peace. Each of us seeks the personal liberationof a mind that is not enslaved to conventional wisdom, a heartthat is able to love without fear, a spirit that cries "yes!" to theuniverse. Each of us strives too for the inner peace that comeswith finding a harmony between what we want out of life andwhat we can have, between our aspirations and our abilities. Thisis the Shabbat peace to which we aspire./HY/CAדאָס געזאַנג פון שבתמיט די זעקס קיסריםפון די זעקס טעג פון דער וואָךהאָב איך זיך געקריגט ביז ערב שבת.זונטיק האָבן זיי צוגענומען מיין שלאָף.מאָנטיק האָבן זיי מיין זאַלץ צעשאָטן.און אויפן דריטן טאָג, מיין גאָט,האָבן זיי פאַרשליידערט מיין ברויטאּון איבער מיין פּנים מיט ריטער געפאָכטן.זּיי האָבן געכאַפּט מיין פליִענדיקע טויבאון האָבן זי געשאָכטן.און אַזוי ביז פרייטיק אין דער פרי.און דאָס איז דאָך מיין גאַנצע וואָך,ווען עם שטאַרכט מיין טויבן-פלי.פאַרנאַכט האָב איך אָנגעצונדן פיר ליכטאון צו מיר איז געקומען די מלכה שבת.עם האָט אַ לויכט געטאָן איר געזיכטאון די גאַנצע וועלט איז געוואָרן שבת.מיין צעשאָטענער זאַלץהאָט געפינקלט אין זעלצל,און מיין טויב, מיין פליִענדיקע טויב,הּאָט געפּאַטשט מיט די פליגלאון גערייניקט איר העלדזל./PH/HN/HYדי מלכה שבת האָט געבענטשט מיינע ליכט.זיי האָבן געלויכטן מיט אַ פלאַם אַ קלאָרן.די שיין האָט פאַרדעקט די טעג פון דער וואָךאון דעם קריג מיט די זעקס קיסרים.די גרינקייט פון בערג _איז די גרינקייט פון שבת.דער זילבער פון טייך _איז דער זילבער פון שבת.דאָס געזאַנג פון דעם ווינט _איז דאָס זינגען פון שבת.און דאָס געזאַנג פון מיין האַרץ _איז דער אייביקער שבת./HN/KASong of the Sabbath / Das Gezang fon ShabesI quarreled with kings till the Sabbath,I fought with the six kingsof the six days of the week.Sunday they took away my sleep.Monday they scattered my salt.And on the third day, my God,they threw out my bread: whips flashedacross my face. The fourth daythey caught my dove, my flying dove,and slaughtered it.It was like that till Friday morning.This is my whole week,the dove's flight dying./PIAt nightfall FridayI lit four candles,and the queen of the Sabbath came to me.Her face lit up the whole world,and made it all a Sabbath.My scattered saltshone in its little bowl,and my dove, my flying dove,clapped its wings together,and licked its throat.The Sabbath queen blessed my candles,and they burned with a pure, clean flame.The light put out the days of the weekand my quarreling with the six kings.The greenness of the mountainsis the greenness of the Sabbath.The silver of the lakeis the silver of the Sabbath.The singing of the windis the singing of the Sabbath.And my heart's songis an eternal Sabbath.Kadia Molodowsky (translated from Yiddish by Jean Valentine)/KAWellfleet SabbathThe hawk eye of the sun slowly shuts.The breast of the bay is softly feathereddove grey.

However, <i>time is life</i>, and to kill time is tomurder. Most of us seem to labor for the sake of things of space.As a result we suffer from a deeply rooted dread of time andstand aghast when compelled to look into its face. Shrinkingfrom facing time, we escape for shelter to things of space./PIMost of us do not live in time but run away from it; we do notsee its face, but its make-up. The past is either forgotten orpreserved as a cliche¶, and the present moment is either barteredfor a silly trinket or beclouded by false anticipations. The presentmoment is a zero, and so is the next moment, and a vast stretchof life turns out to be a series of zeros, with no real number infront.Blind to the marvel of the present moment, we live withmemories of moments missed, in anxiety about an emptinessthat lies ahead. We are unprepared when the problem strikes usin unmitigated form.Time is our most important frontier, the advance region ofsignificant being, a region where our true freedom lies. Spacedivides us, time unites us. We wage wars over things of space;the treasures of time lie open to every one of us.Time has independent ultimate significance; it is of moremajesty and more evocative of awe than even a sky studded withstars. Gliding gently in the most ancient of all splendors, it tellsso much more than space can say in its broken language ofthings, playing symphonies upon the instruments of isolatedbeings, unlocking the earth and making it happen. Time is theprocess of creation, and things of space are results of creation.When looking at space we see the products of creation; whenintuiting time we hear the process of creation. Things of spaceexhibit a deceptive independence. They show off a veneer oflimited permanence. Things created conceal the Creator. It isthe dimension of time wherein we meet God, wherein webecome aware that every instant is an act of creation, aBeginning, opening up new roads for ultimate realizations. Timeis the presence of God in the world of space, and it is within timethat we are able to sense the unity of all beings.Abraham Joshua Heschel
