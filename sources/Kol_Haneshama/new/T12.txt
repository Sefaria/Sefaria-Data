Our morning psalm service begins withthe words "Blessed is the one who spoke." We begin to pray by proclaim-ing the divinity and great power of words themselves. The prayerbookconveys our sense of inadequacy of coming before God with human lan-guage. How can words ever be adequate vehicles for expressing our mostinward thoughts?<small>A.G.</small>C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The God affirmed in the words of <i>Baruḥ She'amar</i> may beunderstood in either concrete anthropomorphic terms or in a more abstractmanner. It is the latter view with which we Reconstructionists are mostcomfortable. Our God is not a person who promises and fulfills as ahuman being would. In speaking of a God who fulfills promises, weexpress our basic trust in life and our affirmation that goodness and godli-ness have their own reward.

In PesukeyDezimrah the kaleidoscopic imagery awakens our emotions. Just as we findour own pace walking through art museums, so <i>Pesukey Dezimrah</i> inviteseach of us to wander amidst its visions. On different days, differentimagery comes to life. <i>Pesukey Dezimrah</i> moves us toward prayerfulness,toward readiness to join in spiritual community.    D.A.T.D<small>ERASH</small>. <i>Pesukey Dezimrah</i> begins with an apology for verbal prayer. It isonly because God "spoke the world into being" that we dare to assumethat words can serve as the vehicles for our deepest prayers. In participatingin verbal prayer, we somehow partake of that same act of Divine word--power through which the world was created. A Ḥasidic comment on theopening line of <i>Baruḥ She'amar</i> translates it: "A <i>baruḥ</i> (blessing) that is saidand creates a world--that's a <i>baruḥ</i>!"

According to the Mishnah, some Jews regularly meditatedfor an hour before beginning public prayer. As the public prayer serviceexpanded, this time of personal preparation became filled with a collectionof psalms and other biblical selections that became known as PesukeyDezimrah--"Verses of Song". Rabbinic literature records many variationsof <i>Pesukey Dezimrah</i>, but common to all versions are selections from Psalms146-150, known as the "Hallel Psalms" because they feature variations ofthat term as a praise of God. Another important Hallel psalm--136-- isalso a traditional part of this section. The central importance of thesepsalms indicates that the major theme of <i>Pesukey Dezimrah</i> is the praise(Hallel) of God. Indeed, the Talmud sometimes refers to <i>Pesukey Dezimrah</i>as the daily Hallel.<small>S.S.</small>Blessed are you, THE EVERLASTING ONE, our God, the sovereignof all worlds. Divine one, who gave birth to all, the merciful,subject of praise upon our people's mouths, lauded and glorifiedupon the tongues of all who love and serve you. And throughthese, the songs sung by your servant David, may we hail you,S<small>OURCE OF </small>B<small>EING</small>. With praises and with melodies we celebrateyour greatness, and we praise you, glorify you, call to mind yourName, and crown you as our sovereign, God of ours, the onlyone, the living one, throughout all worlds. The one who reigns,lauded and glorified unto the end of time, whose name is evergreat. Blessed are you, THE ONE, the sovereign hailed in songsof praise.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Although the patchwork of psalms and praises known as<i>Pesukey Dezimrah</i> is said to have evolved centuries after the prayer serviceitself, one can sense in this preface to the service an important echo ofworship in biblical times--both the daily service of priests and Levites inthe Temple, and the prayers of pilgrims ascending to the Holy City forthe seasonal festivals. This bold appropriation of historical memory, under-taken in a period of exile and dispersion, affirms the continuity of biblicalIsrael with the later people Israel--in effect, inscribing the image of theformer upon the latter. All of the themes and moods of the service arepresent in <i>Pesukey Dezimraḥ</i>.

Rabbi Simlay said: "A person should arrange praise of the HolyOne and then pray" (Talmud Beraḥot 32a). <i>Pesukey Dezimrah</i> is a prepara-tion. It helps our transition into prayer.    L.W.K. (ADAPTED)Give thanks to THE MAGNIFICENT, call on the name,make known among all peoples, God's great deeds.Sing songs of God, make melody for God,converse about God's wondrous acts.Celebrate the holy name,God will delight the heart of those who seek THE ONE.Inquire of THE HOLY ONE and gather strength,search out the divine presence always.Call to mind the wondrous things God did,the acts of wonderment, the judgments of God's mouth.Sing to THE INCOMPARABLE throughout the earth,bring news, from one day to the next, of divine help.Tell among the nations of God's glory,amid all peoples, of God's wondrous acts.For great is THE ETERNAL, celebrated mightily,and awesome, above all false gods,for all the gods of popular imaginings are mere idols,but THE CREATOR alone made the heavens.I Chronicles 16:8-12, 23-26/HY	ּהוֹדוּ לַיהוה קִרְאוּ בִשְׁמוֹ	הוֹֽֽֽדִיעוּ בָעַמִּים עֲלִילוֹתָיו:	ּשִׁירוּ לוֹ זַמְּרוּ-לוֹ	ֽֽֽשִׂיחוּ בְּכָל-נִפְלְאוֹתָיו:	ּהִתְהַלְלוּ בְּשֵׁם קָדְשׁוֹ	יִשְׂמַח לֵב מְבַקְשֵׁי יהוה:	ּדִּרְשׁוּ יהוה וְעֻזּוֹ	בַּקְּשׁוּ פָנָיו תָּמִיד:	ּזִכְרוּ נִפְלְאֹתָיו אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה	מֹפְתָיו וּמִשְׁפְּטֵי-ֽֽֽפִיהוּ:	ּֽֽֽשִׁירוּ לַיהוה כָּל-הָֽֽֽאָרֶץ	בַּשְּׂרוּ מִיּוֹם-אֶל-יוֹם יְשׁוּעָתוֹ:	ּסַפְּרוּ בַגּוֹיִם אֶת-כְּבוֹדוֹ	בְּכָל-הָעַמִּים נִפְלְאוֹתָיו:	ּכִּי גָדוֹל יהוה וּמְהֻלָּל מְאֹד	וְנוֹרָא הוּא עַל-כָּל-אֱלֹהִים:	ּ*כִּי כָּל-אֱלֹהֵי הָעַמִּים אֱלִילִים וַיהוה שָֽֽֽׁמַיִם עָשָׂה:/HNדימת וינפ ושקב / search out the divine presence always. The Hebrew literallyreads "Seek His face always." The religious person is one who knows ineach situation how to seek "the face of God." Whatever befalls us andwherever life may lead, we find ourselves still seeking. Each unique humansituation calls upon us to find God's presence and act upon it in a uniqueway.    A.G.D<small>ERASH</small>. The service of gratitude is eternal. As the Rabbis put it (LeviticusRabah 9), though in the time to come all sacrifices will cease, the thank--offering will never cease. It will last on in eternity; thanksgiving will neverbecome obsolete in the realms of spiritual bliss. A world full ofpraise--how near to heaven it would be! We must bring ourselves into linewith such ideals. Our worship must not be impatient supplication, butpatient praise. We must think less of what we lack, more of what wehave.    M.M.K.A song of triumph. A psalm of David.The skies recount the glory of divinity,God's handiwork the heavens' dome declares.Day after day pours forth its evidence,night after night expresses knowledge of it,yet without speech and without words,without their voice being heard.Through all the earth their chord goes forth,and to the farthest reaches of the globe, their phrase.For the sun a tent is placed in their domain,and it is like a bridegroom stepping from his canopy,rejoicing like a mighty runner on his course,the borders of the heavens are his starting point,his orbit runs beyond their other edge,with nothing hidden from his warmth./PIלא דובכ םירפסמ םימשה / The skies recount the glory of divinity. The Hebrewverb <i>mesaperim</i> ("recount") is associated by the rabbis with the word"sapphire." The verse would then mean, "The heavens shine like sapphirewith the glory of God."    A.G.םּוָּק  ּtheir chord, literally, their linecּhord, here understood as a musicalchord. Belief in "the music of the spheres," a notion shared by many cul-tures in the ancient and medieval world, is perhaps reflected here, and itbears interesting resonance with conceptions of the cosmos advanced inmodern physics and astronomy. The music of the spheres and that of thepsalmist stand in a certain parallel.    J.R./HYלַּמְנַֽֽֽצֵּחַ מִזְמוֹר לְדָוִד:הַּשָּֽֽֽׁמַיִם מְסַפְּרִים כְּבוֹד-אֵל וּמַעֲשֵׂה יָדָיו מַגִּיד הָרָֽֽֽקִיעַ:יּוֹם לְיוֹם יַֽֽֽבִּיעַ ֽֽֽאֹמֶר וְֽֽֽלַיְלָה לְֽֽֽלָיְלָה יְחַוֶּה-ֽֽֽדָּעַת:אֵּין ֽֽֽאֹמֶר וְאֵין דְּבָרִים בְּלִי נִשְׁמָע קוֹלָם:ּבְּכָל-הָֽֽֽאָרֶץ יָצָא קַוָּם וּבִקְצֵה תֵבֵל מִלֵּיהֶם לַֽֽֽשֶּׁמֶשׁ שָׂם ֽֽֽאֹהֶל בָּהֶם:וְּהוּא כְּחָתָן יֹצֵא מֵחֻפָּתוֹ יָשִׂישׂ כְּגִבּוֹר לָרוּץ ֽֽֽאֹרַח:מִּקְצֵה הַשָּֽֽֽׁמַיִם מוֹצָאוֹ וּתְקוּפָתוֹ עַל-קְצוֹתָם וְאֵין נִסְתָּר מֵחַמָּתוֹ:PּH/HNNature is God's niggun,a wordless melody of unfolding Life.To awaken to God we must hear the <i>nigun</i>.To awaken to God we must listen in deep silence.Silence arises when thinking ceases.If we would know Godwe must quiet the mind,cease the chatter that passes for knowledgewhen in fact it only flatters the foolish.We cannot live without wordsbut let us not imagine that words are sufficient.As a symphony needs rest to lift music out of noise,so we need Silence to lift Truth out of words.    R.M.S.K<small>AVANAH</small>. There are two things that fill my soul with holy reverence andever-growing wonder--the spectacle of the starry sky that virtually annihi-lates us as physical beings, and the Moral Law that raises us to infinitedignity as intelligent agents.    IMMANUEL KANTThe Torah of THE ONE is flawless, it restores the soul,the testimony of THE ONE is true, it makes wise the simple,precepts of THE ONE are sure, they make the heart rejoice,the mitzvah of THE ONE is clear, it gives light to the eyes,fear of THE ONE is pure, it stands eternally,the judgments of THE ONE are true, together they are just,desired more than gold, and greater than the purest gold,sweeter than honey, than the nectar of a honeycomb!Your servant, too, is being enlightened by them,in their preservation is great consequence.Our petty failures, who can understand?From hidden faults declare me clean!And from premeditated ones, as well, protect your servant.Do not let them govern me!Then might I be perfect, cleared of grave wrongdoing.May the utterances of my mouth be pleasing,the conceptions of my heart, before you,P<small>RECIOUS </small>O<small>NE</small>, my rock, my champion.Psalm 19C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Rabbi Kaplan used to say that if you want to discover thetruth of a statement about God, you must invert it. He would then state,"The Torah of God is flawless, restoring the soul" should be read"whatever restores the soul is the Torah of God."
