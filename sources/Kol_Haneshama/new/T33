/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Since it was difficult for Babylonian Jewry to ascertain
when the new moon had been sighted and the new month declared in the
land of Israel, the rabbis of Babylonia were uncertain which were the cor-
rect days for observing the Festivals. To insure that the Festivals were kept
on the proper days, they were lengthened to create a margin for error.
Whereas in Israel Shavuot was one day, Pesah/± seven days, and Sukkot /-
 Shemini Atzeret eight days, in Babylonia they became two days, eight
days, and nine days. Once the dates were established by astronomical calcu-
lation and the possibility of error was eliminated, the rabbis nonetheless
retained the longer holiday periods for those living outside the land of
Israel to emphasize their exile./PR

Wishing to form closer links with Israelis, hoping to strengthen holiday
observance, and accepting the evolving nature of Jewish tradition, many
Jews in countries across the world have come to observe the holiday pat-
tern of the land of Israel. This has long been the common mode among
Reconstructionist congregations and havurot, a fact reflected in the struc-
ture of this prayerbook.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

reflect their theological outlooks and ethical concerns. At any place where

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. All of the Pilgrimage Festivals--Pesah/±, Shavuot and
Sukkot--contain themes of revelation and redemption, of moving from
darkness to light, from despair to hope, from despondency to joy. Psalm 43
which begins with a powerful sense of isolation, gloom and abandonment,
shifts in mood as the psalmist begins to sense the redemptive power of the
divine. As the psalmist experiences a rebirth of hope, the mood becomes
joyful and thankful. This psalm thus encapsulates the emotional shift we
anticipate as we reencounter the three annual seasons of joy.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Moodiness, alienation, even depression are a normal part
of life to many of us. The speaker of Psalm 43 has felt totally abandoned,
but offers an antidote: the belief in a higher power that hears prayer and
answers. At the moment of asking the question, "Why are you downcast,
my soul?" the psalmist already has found an answer--hope in God.    /SC/XXH.L./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. It is customary to read /ITShir Hashirim/XX on the holiday of
Pesah/±. This beautiful love poetry has been traditionally understood as an
allegory of Godòs love for the people of Israel. This love is formalized in
a marriage covenant at Sinai during the holiday of Shavuot. The themes
of the birth of young love and the reawakening of the earth after winteròs
dormancy complement the account of the Jewish peopleòs birth in the
escape from Egyptian slavery. Just as the Jewish people came forth into
freedom during the spring season when nature bursts forth out of its fro-
zen state, so do we hope that all people may leave behind the narrow places
of their lives (/ITmitzrayim/XX) and experience the renewal of true freedom.    /SC/XXR.S./XX/PR
