/PL783/XXREADINGS: TORAH STUDY/XX/PR

The rabbinic concept of language and meaning has at its center
the concept of the divinity of the text....The text ultimately is
not...that authoritative and divine document given to Moses at
a particular time and place. The Talmud claims that "the Torah
preceded the world" (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 88b). If the
world of space and time had not yet been created, then in what
manner did the Torah exist? "It was written with letters of black
fire upon a background of white fire" (Rashi on Deuteronomy
33:2). The material ink and parchment are seen as the garments
for the divine wisdom enclothed therein./PR

/PR

In other words, in the rabbinic view, the Torah is not an artifact
of nature, a product of the universe; the universe, on the
contrary, is the product of the Torah. According to the famous
midrash on the first verses of Genesis:/PR

/PR

It is customary that when human beings build a palace, they
do not build it according to their own wisdom, but according
to the wisdom of experts. And the experts do not build
according to their own wisdom, rather they have plans and
records in order to know how to make rooms and corridors.
The Holy One did the same. God looked into the Torah and
created the world. (Bereyshit Rabah:1:1)/PR

/PR

Far from being a physical book, the Torah, in the rabbinic view,
is the blueprint of creation and therefore there is a direct
correlation between the world and Torah. The Torah is not seen
as speculation /ITabout/XX the world, but part of its very essence./PR

/PGREADINGS: TORAH STUDY/XX784/XX/PR

A new "learning" is about to be born--rather, it has been born.
It is a learning in reverse order. A learning that no longer starts
from the Torah and leads into life, but the other way round:
from life, from a world that knows nothing of the Law, or
pretends to know nothing, back to the Torah. That is the sign
of the time./PR

/PR

It is the sign of the time because it is the mark of the men and
women of the time. There is no one today who is not alienated,
who does not have some small fraction of alienation inside. All
of us to whom Judaism, to whom being a Jew, has again become
the pivot of our lives...we all know that in being Jews we must
not give up anything, not renounce anything, but lead
everything back to Judaism. From the periphery back to the
center; from the outside in./PR

/PR

This is a new sort of learning. A learning for which--in these
days--those are the most apt who bring with them the
maximum of what is alien. That is to say...they will succeed, not
in the capacity of specialists, but only as Jews who are alienated,
as those who are groping for the way home./PR

/PR

It is not a matter of pointing out relations between what is
Jewish and what is non-Jewish. There has been enough of that.
It is not a matter of apologetics, but rather of finding the way
back into the heart of our life. And of being confident that this
heart is a Jewish heart. For we are Jews./PR

The days come and go. Imperceptibly our lives change. We

first step into adulthood./PR

Connections are made slowly, sometimes they grow
underground. You cannot tell always by looking what is
happening. More than half a tree is spread out in the soil under
your feet. Penetrate quietly as the earthworm that blows no
trumpet. Fight persistently as the creeper that brings down the
tree. Spread like the squash plant that overruns the garden.
Gnaw in the dark and use the sun to make sugar./PR

/PR

Weave real connections, create real nodes, build real houses. Live
a life you can endure: make love that is loving. Keep tangling
and interweaving and taking more in, a thicket and bramble
wilderness to the outside but to us interconnected with rabbit
runs and burrows and lairs./PR

/PR

Live as if you liked yourself, and it may happen: reach out, keep
reaching out, keep bringing in. This is how we are going to live
for a long time: not always, for every gardener knows that after
the digging, after the planting, after the long season of tending
and growth, the harvest comes./PR
