/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. A. J. Heschel has said, "The term, `God of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacobò is semantically different from a term such as `the God of truth,
goodness, and beauty.ò Abraham, Isaac and Jacob do not signify ideas, prin-
ciples or abstract values. Nor do they stand for teachers or thinkers, and
the term is not to be understood like that of `the God of Kant, Hegel, and
Schelling.ò Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not principles to be compre-
hended but lives to be continued. The life of one who joins the covenant
of Abraham continues the life of Abraham. For the present is not apart
from the past. `Abraham is still standing before Godò (Genesis 18:22).
Abraham endures forever. We are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." In this same
spirit, we are also Sarah and Rebekah, Rachel and Leah.    /SC/XXL.W.K./XX/PR

/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. The introductory words (Psalm 51:17) of the /ITAmidah/XX contain
a paradox of divine and human power. Our ability to be whole, upright,
free, and fully alive grows as we acknowledge and appreciate an infinitely
higher source of power in the universe. This allows us to be receptive. By
acknowledging our human vulnerability, we open our hearts to the sup-
port, compassion, and faithfulness available around us.    /SC/XXS.P.W./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. /ITHatefilah/XX / The Prayer, is the central prayer of the worship
service. The language and manner of reciting the /ITTefilah/XX offer insights into
the place of the individual in communal prayer. When the /ITTefilah/XX is recited
privately, each individual stands (hence the name /ITAmidah/XX, "standing") and
addresses God in a sustained conversational way. Calling God "you" indi-
cates intimacy and immediacy. Nevertheless, the individual prays with the
communal voice: "We acknowledge you," "Bless us," "Grant us peace."
The Mishnah provides the structure within which additional prayers and
petitions are placed. Even an individualòs private needs have importance
within the communal context./PR

Throughout the centuries the pursuit of meaningful communal prayer has
led to variations in the /ITAmidah/XX. These variations reflect the attitudes and
beliefs of different prayer communities. In the ongoing pursuit of mean-
ingful prayer for a Reconstructionist prayer community, changes have been
introduced into this /ITAmidah/XX, most notably in the first two of the seven
/ITberah/±ot/XX which comprise the Shabbat /ITAmidah/XX. The first /ITberah/±ah/XX has been
expanded to include the matriarchs along with the patriarchs as exemplars
of Godòs presence in human lives. By concentrating on examples of heal-
ing forces and life-sustaining rains, the second /ITberah/±ah/XX acknowledges God
as the power that sustains life. The traditional emphasis on Godòs ability
to resurrect the dead has been replaced here by a celebration of God as the
power that sustains all life.    /SC/XXS.S./PR

ר ר / /ITezrat sarah/XX. The biblical term /ITezer/XX has two meanings, "rescue"
and "be strong." It is commonly translated as "aid" or "help". It also has
the sense of power and strength. In Deuteronomy 33:29, /ITezer/XX is parallel to
ו, majesty. Eve is described as Adamòs /ITezer kenegdo/XX, a power equal to him,
a strength and majesty to match his. Thus /ITmagen avraham/XX (shield of Abra-
ham) and /ITezrat sarah/XX (help of Sarah) are parallel images of power and
protection.    /SC/XXR.S.A./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. The insights of wonder must be constantly kept alive. Since there
is a need for daily wonder, there is a need for daily worship. The sense of
the "miracles which are daily with us," the sense of the "continual mar-
vels," is the source of prayer. There is no worship, no music, no love, if
we take for granted the blessings or defeats of living . . . . The profound
and perpetual awareness of the wonder of being has become a part of the
religious consciousness of the Jew.    /SC/XXA.J.H./XX/PR

arose against your people Israel, forcing them to shun your
Torah and to leave off from the laws your will ordained. And
you, in your abundant mercy, stood up for Israel in their hour
of distress. You pressed their claim, exacted justice for them. You
delivered armed might to the weak, the many to the power of
the few, the wicked to the power of the just, the vicious to the
power of those occupied with Torah. You made known your
name that day, and made it holy in your world. And for your
people Israel you enacted great deliverance, as in our own time.
Afterward, your children came into your Templeòs inner room.
