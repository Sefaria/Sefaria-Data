with wisdom in every detail.See the heavens above like a tent,Constructed with loops and hooks,And the moon with its stars, like a shepherdessSending her sheep into the reeds;The moon itself among the clouds,Like a ship sailing under its banners;The clouds like a girl in her gardenMoving, and watering the myrtle-trees;The dew-mist--a woman shakingDrops from her hair to the ground.The inhabitants turn, like animals, to rest,(Their palaces are their stables);And all fleeing from the fear of death,Like a dove pursued by the falcon.And these are compared at the end to a plateWhich is smashed into innumerable shards.Shmuel Hanagid/KAWhere We Can Find GodWhere will I find GodWhose glory fills the universe?I find GodWherever the farmer ploughs a furrow through the hard soil,Wherever the quarryman pounds the stone to gravel,Wherever one earns her bread by the sweat of her brow,In the company of the friendless, the afflicted, the lowly, thelost,There God abides in sun and shower./PII find GodWherever the mind is free to follow its own bent,Wherever words come out from the depth of truth,Wherever tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection,Wherever people struggle for freedom and right,Wherever the scientist toils to unbare the secrets of nature,Wherever the poet strings pearls of beauty in lyric lines,Wherever glorious deeds are done.I find GodIn the merry shouts of children at play,In the lullaby the mother sings, rocking her baby to sleep,In the slumber that falls on the infant's eyelids,And in the smile that plays on his sleeping lips.I find GodWhen the dawn comes with her golden cornucopia,Or when evening falls, bringing peace and rest from theWestern ocean of rest.God is in the joy that streams from heaven with the morninglight,In the current of life that courses day and night through mysinews and through all nature,In the life that throbs exultant in the dust of the earth andthrough the blades of grass innumerable,And that flows, in a multitude of tempestuous waves, throughthe leaves and flowers.I find GodIn the wealth of those passing delights that live but for amoment,In the pulsebeat of a life that comes from eternity and dancesin my own blood,In birth that keeps renewing the generations,And in death that keeps knocking on the doors of life.Rabindranath Tagore (translated and adapted)/KAGod The Life of NatureOur ancestors acclaimed the GodWhose handiwork they readIn the mysterious heavens above,And in the varied scene of earth below,In the orderly march of days and nights,Of seasons and years,And in the checkered fate of humankind.Night reveals the limitless caverns of space,Hidden by the light of day,And unfolds horizonless vistasFar beyond imagination's ken.The mind is staggered,Yet soon regains its poise,And peering through the boundless dark,Orients itself anewBy the light of distant sunsShrunk to glittering sparks.The soul is faint,Yet soon revives,And learns to spell once more the name of GodAcross the newly visioned firmament.Lift your eyes, look up;Who made these stars?God is the onenessThat spans the fathomless deeps of spaceAnd the measureless eons of time,Binding them together in deed,As we do in thought./PIGod is the samenessIn the elemental substance of stars and planets,Of this our earthly abodeAnd of all that it holds.God is the unityOf all that is,The uniformity of all that moves,The rhythm of all thingsAnd the nature of their interaction.God is the mystery of life,Enkindling inert matterWith inner drive and purpose.God is the creative flameThat transfigures lifeless substance,Leaping into ever higher realms of being,Brightening into the radiant glow of feeling,Till it runs into the white fire of thought.And though no sign of living thingsBreaks the eternal silence of the spheres,We cannot deem this earth,This tiny speck in the infinitude,Alone instinct with God.By that tokenWhich unites the worlds in bonds of matterAre all the worlds boundIn the bond of Life.God is in the faithBy which we overcomeThe fear of loneliness, of helplessness,Of failure and of death./PIGod is in the hopeWhich, like a shaft of light,Cleaves the dark abysmsOf sin, of suffering, and of despair.God is in the loveWhich creates, protects, forgives.It is God's spiritThat broods upon the chaos we have wrought,Disturbing its static wrongs,And stirring into life the formless beginningsOf the new and better world.Mordecai M. Kaplan (adapted)/KAIn PraiseGENESIS 1, 2Hail the hand that scattered space with stars,Wrapped whirling world in bright blue blanket, air,Made worlds within worlds, elements in earth,Souls within skins, every one a teeming universe,Every tree a system of semantics, and pushedBeyond probability to place consciousnessOn this cooling crust of burning rock.Oh praise that hand, mind, heart, soul, power or forceThat so inclosed, separated, limited planets, trees, humansYet breaks all bounds and bordersTo lavish on us light, love, lifeThis trembling glory.Ruth Brin/KATreesTo be a giant and keep quiet about it,To stay in one's own place;To stand for the constant presence of processAnd always to seem the same;To be steady as a rock and always trembling,Having the hard appearance of deathWith the soft, fluent nature of growth,One's Being deceptively armored,One's Becoming deceptively vulnerable;To be so tough, and take the light so well,Freely providing forbidden knowledgeOf so many things about heaven and earthFor which we should otherwise have no word--Poems or people are rarely so lovely,And even when they have great qualitiesThey tend to tell you rather than exemplifyWhat they believe themselves to be about,While from the moving silence of trees,Whether in storm or calm, in leaf and naked,Night or day, we draw conclusions of our own,Sustaining and unnoticed as our breath,And perilous also--though there has never beenA critical tree--about the nature of things.Howard NemerovThe essence of the Jewish conception of life seems to me to liein an affirmative attitude to the life of all creation. The life ofthe individual has meaning only insofar as it aids in making thelife of every living thing nobler and more beautiful. Life issacred--that is to say, it is the supreme value, to which all othervalues are subordinate. The hallowing of the supra-individuallife brings in its train a reverence for everything spiritual--aparticularly characteristic feature of the Jewish tradition.But the Jewish tradition also contains something else, somethingwhich finds splendid expression in many of the Psalms, namelya sort of intoxicated joy and amazement at the beauty andgrandeur of this world, of which humankind can just form afaint notion. It is the feeling from which true scientific researchdraws its spiritual substance, but which also seems to findexpression in leafy trees and the crash of waves.Albert Einstein/KAIn No WayI am of the family of the universe, and with all of us togetherI do not fear being alone; I can reach out and touch a rock or ahand or dip my feet in water. Always there is somebody closeby, and when I speak, I am answered by a plane's roar or thebird's whistling or the voices of others in conversation far apartfrom me. When I lie down to sleep, I am in the company ofthe dark and the stars.Breathe to me, sheep in the meadow. Sun and moon, my fatherand my father's brother, kiss me on the brow with your light.My sister, earth, holds me up to be kissed. Sun and moon, I smileat you both and spread my arms in affection and lay myself downat full length for the earth to know I love it too and am neverto be separated from it. In no way shall death part us.David Ignatow/HYרִּבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם זַֽֽֽכֵּינִי לְהַרְבּוֹת בְּהִתְבּוֹדְדוּת תָּמִיד וְאֶזְכֶּה לִהְיוֹתרָּגִיל לָצֵאת בְּכֹל יוֹם לַשָּׂדֶה בֵּין אִילָנוֹת וְעֲשָׂבִים וְכֹל ֽֽֽשִׂיחַ הַשָּׂדֶהוְּשָׁם אֶזְכֶּה לְהִתְבּוֹדֵד וּלְהַרְבּוֹת בְּשִׂיחָה זוֹ תְּפִלָּה בֵּינִי לְבֵין קוֹנִילָּֽֽֽשׂוּחַ שָׁם כֹּל אֲשֶׁר עִם לְבָבִי וְכֹל ֽֽֽשִׂיחַ הַשָּׂדֶה וְכֹל הָעֲשָׂבִיםוְּהָאִילָנוֹת וְכֹל הַצְּמָחִים כּוּלָּם יִתְעוֹרְרוּ לִקְרָאתִי וְיַעֲלוּ וְיִתְּנוּ כֹּחָםוְּחַיּוּתָם לְתוֹךְ דִּבְרֵי שִׂיחָתִי וּתְפִילָּתִי עַד שֶׁתִּהְיֶה תְּפִילָּתִי וְשִׂיחָתִינִּשְֽֽֽׁלֶמֶת בְּתַכְלִית הַשְּׁלֵימוּת עַל יְדֵי כֹּל ֽֽֽשִׂיחַ הַשָּׂדֶה שֶׁיּוּכְלְלוּ כּוּלָּםעִּם כֹּל כֹּחוֹתָם וְחַיּוּתָם וְרוּחָנִיוּתָם עַד שָׁרְשָׁם הָעֶלְיוֹן:/HNGod, grant me the ability to be alone;may it be my custom to go outdoors each dayamong the trees and grass,among all growing things,and there may I be alone,and enter into prayer,to talk with the One to whom I belong.May I express there everything in my heart,and may all the foliage of the field(all grasses, trees and plants)may they all awake at my coming,to send the powers of their lifeinto the words of my prayerso that my prayer and speechare made wholethrough the life and spirit of all growing things,which are made as oneby their transcendentSource.Attributed to Naḥman of Bratzlav (translated by Shamai Kanter)/HYיְּעִיֽֽֽרוּנִי שְׂעִפַּי לַחֲזוֹֽֽֽתֶךָוְּיַרְֽֽֽאוּנִי בְּעֵין לֵב נוֹרְאוֹֽֽֽתֶיךָוְּיוֹֽֽֽרוּנִי לְהַגִּיד נִפְלְאוֹֽֽֽתֶיךָּכִּי אֶרְאֶה שָֽֽֽׁמֶיךָ מַעֲשֵׂה אֶצְבְּעוֹֽֽֽתֶיךָ:מִּתְהַלֵּךְ עֲלֵי קַו חוּג שָֽֽֽׁמַיִםּוּמְסַבֵּב מְסִבָּתוֹ כְּאָבְֽֽֽנַיִםּוּמְסַפֵּר כְּבוֹדְךָ בְלִי שְׂפָֽֽֽתַיִםוְּהָֽֽֽאָרֶץ עוֹֽֽֽמֶדֶת בִּנְֽֽֽתַּיִםוְּהִיא תְלוּיָה בְּחַבְלֵי אַהֲבָֽֽֽתֶךָ:שָׁם שׁוֹאֵף הַֽֽֽשֶּׁמֶשׁ וְזוֹֽֽֽרֵחַוְּהוּא אוֹצֵל מֵאוֹרוֹ לְיָֽֽֽרֵחַוְּהַגַּלְגַּל כְּמוֹ ֽֽֽאֹהֶל מוֹֽֽֽתֵחַוְּכוֹכָבִים עָלָיו כְּגַן פּוֹֽֽֽרֵחַלְהוֹֽֽֽדִיעַ ֽֽֽעֹמֶק מַחְשְׁבוֹֽֽֽתֶיךָ:/HNMy thoughts awaken me to see you;They show me in my heart's eye your deeds;They teach me to tell your wonders,"When I behold your heavens,The work your fingers made."Around its course the disk of heaven walks,A potter's wheel enwhirling the world;It has no lips, and yet it tells your gloryTo earth, unmoved within its orbit,Suspended in the void,By cords of your love stayed./PIThither the sun yearns, and there burns,And of its light some to the moon lends.While heaven's sphere is spread out like a tent,With stars blooming on it, a garden,Proclaiming how profoundThe plans that you have laid.Moses ibn Ezra (translated by Raymond Sheindlin [adapted])/HYּכָּתַב סְתָיו בִּדְיוֹ מְטָרָיו וּבִרְבִיבָיוּוּבְעֵט בְּרָקָיו הַמְּאִירִים וְכַף עָבָיומִּכְתָּב עֲלֵי גַן מִתְּֽֽֽכֵלֶת וְאַרְגָּמָןלֹּא נִתְכְּנוּ כָהֵם לְחוֹשֵׁב בְּמַחְשָׁבָיו:לָּכֵן בְּעֵת חָמְדָה אֲדָמָה פְּנֵי ֽֽֽשַׁחַקרָּקְמָה עֲלֵי בַדֵּי עֲרוּגוֹת כְּכוֹכָבָיו:/HNWith the ink of its showers and rains,with the quill of its lightning,with the hand of its clouds,winter wrote a letter upon the garden,in purple and blue.No artist could ever conceive the like of that.And this is why the earth, grown jealous of the sky,embroidered stars in the folds of the flower-beds.Solomon ibn Gabirol (translated by T. Carmi)/KAThe Peace of Wild ThingsWhen despair for the world grows in meand I wake in the night at the least soundin fear of what my life and my children's lives may be,I go and lie down where the wood drakerests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.I come into the peace of wild thingswho do not tax their lives with forethoughtof grief. I come into the presence of still water.And I feel above me the day-blind starswaiting with their light. For a timeI rest in the grace of the world, and am free.Wendell BerryHow can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land?...Ifwe do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of thewater, how can you buy them?Every part of this earth is sacred. Every shining pine needle,every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every clearingand humming insect is holy. We are part of the earth and it ispart of us. The perfumed flowers are our sisters; the deer, thehorse, the great eagle, these are our brothers. The rocky crests,the juices in the meadows, the body heat of the pony, andpeople--all belong to the same family....This shining water that moves in the streams and rivers is notjust water but the blood of our ancestors. If we sell you land,you must remember that it is sacred, and you must teach yourchildren that it is sacred and that each ghostly reflection in theclear water of the lakes tells of events and memories...Thewater's murmur is the voice of my father's father.The rivers are our brothers, they quench our thirst. The riverscarry our canoes, and feed our children. If we sell you our land,you must remember, and teach your children, that the rivers areour brothers and yours, and you must henceforth give the riversthe kindness you would give any brother.You must teach your children that the ground beneath their feetis the ashes of our grandparents. So that they will respect theland, tell your children that the earth is rich with the lives ofour kin. Teach your children...that the earth is our mother.Whatever befalls the earth befalls the children of the earth. Ifwe spit upon the ground, we spit upon ourselves.This we know: the earth does not belong to us; we belong tothe earth. All things are connected. We are kin after all....Ted Perry, 1970, Speech often attributed to Chief Seattle, 1851
