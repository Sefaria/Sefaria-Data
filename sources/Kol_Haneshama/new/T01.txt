KABBALAT SHABBAT/WELCOMING SHABBAT/HNThe <i>Kabbalat Shabbat</i> service was created by the Kabbalists(Jewish mystics) of Safed in the sixteenth century and wasalmost universally accepted by Jewish communities. Though arelatively recent innovation in Jewish liturgy, it probably springsfrom ancient customs such as those of R. Ḥanina and R. Yanay(third century Palestine). The Talmud records that at sunset onShabbat eve, R. Ḥanina would stand dressed in fine garmentsand say, "Come, let us go forth to welcome the Sabbath queen."R. Yanay, in festive attire, would exclaim, "Come, Oh bride!Come, Oh bride!"The augmented version of <i>Kabbalat Shabbat</i> presented here isintended to offer variety within a traditional form of worship.The prayer-leader (<i>sheliaḥ tzibur</i>) should construct a service byselecting elements from among the introductory hymns,passages from the Song of Songs, Psalms, and additional readingsto be found below. For additional readings see pages 732-766.<small>A.G./S.S.</small>הקדצ/<i>tzedakah</i>. As God created for six days, so too do we labor. Just beforeShabbat--the time of divine and human rest--begins, some of us engagein <i>tzedakah</i> to complete the work of renewing creation. The root lettersof the word <i>tzedakah</i> translate as "justice" or "righteousness." By givingto those in need, we help to right a wrong and thus share responsibilityfor creation. In some homes the <i>pushka</i> or <i>tzedakah</i> box stands next to theShabbat candles to receive the last coins of our workaday lives.Some families may direct their <i>tzedakah</i> to a particular charity, organiza-tion, or cause. Family discussion and reconsideration of choices from timeto time may heighten the meaning of the act. Some households createtheir own <i>pushka</i> and adorn it with biblical verses and illustration.Rabbi Elazar would always give a coin to a poor person before praying. Inexplanation he would quote, "I shall behold your face <i>betzedek</i>, inrighteousness" (Psalm 17:15).<small>B.W./K.G.</small>HADLAKAT NEROT SHABBAT /LIGHTING SHABBAT CANDLESCandles are traditionally lit in the home.

While minimally we light two new Shabbat candles, we maychoose to light more. Some families light a candle for each member.The physical motions associated with candlelighting are unique to each ofus and take on individual meaning. Some lift their hands over the flamesand toward themselves as though drawing the light of Shabbat into them-selves. Others lift their hands over the flames six times as though to incor-porate each day of the week into Shabbat.Many people cover their eyes while saying the blessing. In this way theymaintain the customary order of blessing before acting--they delay theirenjoyment of the lights. Covering the eyes also symbolizes our need toavert our eyes from the blinding light of the divine.Many of us set aside the contemplative moments before and after candle--lighting as a time for our own private prayers and intentions.<small>B.W./K.G./D.A.T.</small>The candles are now lit. After candlelighting, the following blessing is recited:Blessed are you, SOURCE OF LIGHT, our God, sovereign ofall worlds, who has made us holy with your mitzvot, andcommanded us to kindle the Shabbat light.* *Blessed is the match that's consumed in kindling a flame.Blessed is the flame that burns in the secret depths of the heart.Hannah Szenes (translator unknown)* *Almighty God,Grant me and all my loved onesA chance truly to rest on this Shabbat.May the light of the candles drive out from among usThe spirit of anger, the spirit of harm.Send your blessings to my children,That they may walk in the ways of your Torah, your light.Shas Tkhines (translator unknown)YEDID NEFESH / SOUL BELOVEDTransliteration can be found on page 9.This translation can be sung to the same melody as the Hebrew.You who love my soul,Sweet source of tendernessTake my inner natureAnd shape it to your will.Like a darting deerI will flee to you.Before your glorious presenceHumbly do I bow.Let your sweet loveDelight me with its thrill.Because no other daintyWill my hunger still.CANDLESThe candles are now lit.

Ḥasidic cus-tom adopted it for use as an introduction to Shabbat. The poet speaks toGod in most intimate terms as lover and parent, but also as shining lightof the universe. The longing for God is fulfilled for "the time has come"as God spreads over the world the great <i>sukkat shalom</i>, canopy of peace,which is Shabbat.The traditional Hebrew text of <i>Yedid Nefesh</i> presented here differs inseveral places from Azikri's original. Most notably, this version substitutesin the second verse "Eternal her delight" for "She shall be your hand-maiden forever." Here tradition seems to have improved on the author'swork!<small>A.G.</small>דִּיד ֽֽֽנֶפֶשׁ אָב הָרַחֲמָן מְשׁוֹךְ עַבְדְּךָ אֶל רְצוֹֽֽֽנֶךָ:יָּרוּץ עַבְדְּךָ כְּמוֹ אַיָּל יִשְׁתַּחֲוֶה אֶל מוּל הֲדָֽֽֽרֶךָ:ּתֶּעֱרַב לוֹ יְדִידוּֽֽֽתֶךָ מִֽֽֽנֹּפֶת צוּף וְכָל-ֽֽֽטָעַם:דּוּר נָאֶה זִיו הָעוֹלָם נַפְשִׁי חוֹלַת אַהֲבָֽֽֽתֶךָ:אָּנָּא אֵל נָא רְפָא נָא לָהּ בְּהַרְאוֹת לָהּ ֽֽֽנֹעַם זִיֽֽֽוֶךָ:אָּז תִּתְחַזֵּק וְתִתְרַפֵּא וְהָיְתָה לָהּ שִׂמְחַת עוֹלָם:תִּיק יֶהֱמוּ נָא רַחֲֽֽֽמֶיךָ וְֽֽֽחוּסָה נָּא עַל בֵּן אֲהוּֽֽֽבֶךָ:ּכִּי זֶה כַמָּה נִכְסֹף נִכְֽֽֽסַפְתִּי לִרְאוֹת בְּתִפְֽֽֽאֶרֶת עֻֽֽֽזֶּךָ:ּֽֽֽאֵלֶּה חָמְדָה לִבִּי ֽֽֽחוּסָה נָּא וְאַל תִּתְעַלָּם:ּגָּלֵה נָא וּפְרוֹשׂ חֲבִיבִי עָלַי אֶת-סֻכַּת שְׁלוֹֽֽֽמֶךָ:ּתָּאִיר ֽֽֽאֶרֶץ מִכְּבוֹֽֽֽדֶךָ נָֽֽֽגִילָה וְנִשְׂמְחָה בָּךְ:מַּהֵר אָהוּב כִּי בָא מוֹעֵד וְחָֽֽֽנֵּנוּ כִּימֵי עוֹלָם:/HNTo see my light in your lightBasking in your grace.My heart's desire isTo harmonize with yoursDo not conceal your pityHide not that light of yours.Help, my lover, spreadYour canopy of peace,Enfold all human beings.Give all pain surcease.Your presence on this earth planeDo make known to usAnd we shall respond thenWith song and with dance.Rush, my love, be quick,The time for love has come,Let your gentle favorGrace us as of old.Eleazar Azikri (translated by Zalman Schachter-Shalomi)C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The first letter of each verse spells out הוהי, the four-lettername of God. That name subsumes and unites all the descriptions whichJewish tradition has evolved in its quest for the divine. Jews may once havecommonly pronounced הוהי, but they have avoided doing so since at leastthe third century B.C.E. The traditional vocalization "Yahweh" can beunderstood as, "He causes to exist," or just, "He is!" It also resembles God'senigmatic words to Moses at the burning bush: "<i>Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh</i>--I AmWho I am" (Exodus 3:14). Thus הוהי hints at the absurdity of assigning aname to an ineffable divinity.<small>M.P.</small>Yedid <u>ne</u>fesh av haraḥaman meshoḥ avdeḥa el retzo<u>ne</u>ḥaYarutz avdeḥa kemo ayal yishtaḥaveh el mul hada<u>re</u>ḥa.Te'erav lo yedidu<u>te</u>ḥa mi<u>no</u>fet tzuf veḥol <u>ta</u>'am.Hadur na'eh ziv ha'olam nafshi ḥolat ahava<u>te</u>ḥa.Ana el na refa na lah beharot lah <u>no</u>`am zi<u>ve</u>ḥa.Az titḥazek vetitrapey vehayetah lah simḥat olam.Vatik yehemu na raḥa<u>me</u>ḥa ve<u>ḥu</u>sah na al ben ahu<u>ve</u>ḥa.Ki zeh ḥamah niḥsof niḥ<u>saf</u>ti lirot beti<u>fe</u>ret u<u>ze</u>ḥa.<u>E</u>leh ḥamdah libi <u>ḥu</u>sah na ve'al titalam.Higaley na ufros ḥavivi alay et sukkat shelo<u>me</u>ḥa.Ta'ir <u>e</u>retz mikevo<u>de</u>ḥa na<u>gi</u>lah venismeḥah baḥ.Maher ahuv ki va mo'ed veḥo<u>ne</u>nu kimey olam.הל אנ אפר אנ לא. A quotation from Moses's prayer to heal Miriam, "God,please heal her" (Numbers 12:13). God is sought as the source of spiritualhealing--soul healing. In union with the divine we find release from thepain of the futile cycle of searching and disappointment. Shabbat is ourrefuge of acceptance, our shelter from cravings and strivings.<small>S.P.W.</small>D<small>ERASH</small>. Our yearning for salvation is the human form of the will to live,which is cosmic and characteristic of all living beings. In our case the willto live is the will to abundant and harmonious living...Human nature ispart of the larger world of nature, and our salvation can only be conceivedas a manifestation of a divine power both within and beyond us.<small>M.M.K.

The historical origins of the love poems that comprise ShirHashirim (The Song of Songs) is unknown. Were they simple shepherdlove poetry, as they present themselves, or did they have a cultic settingin the distant pre-Israelite past, as some have suggested? The Kabbalistsprescribed the recitation of the Song of Songs at <i>Kabbalat Shabbat</i>. Theysaw it as a love poem between the blessed Holy One and the <i>Sheḥinah</i>, orthe male and female elements within divinity. Only in the union of thesetwo can divine blessing flow into the world, giving us the enjoyment ofShabbat peace.<small>A.G.</small>N<small>OTE</small>. The translator, hearing a play on words in Hebrew, uses the spicename "balsamum" because of its likeness in sound to "Solomon." KingSolomon is the reputed author of <i>Shir Hashirim</i>.

The term Sheḥinah is an expansion of the biblical conceptof <i>Kevod HaShem</i> 'ה דובכ, the manifest presence of God. In post-biblicalliterature Sheḥinah, which derives from the root ןכש, to dwell, came tomean the feminine, in-dwelling experience of God. Jewish mystical litera-ture elaborated this image of the Sheḥinah as feminine. Mystics thus sawthe unity of the divine realm as dependent upon the healing union ofGod's transcendent (masculine) and immanent (feminine) aspects. It wasbelieved that the people Israel can promote this healing through prayerand Torah. The rabbis understood this union between masculine and femi-nine, God and Israel, King and Sheḥinah, to be at the heart of ShirHashirim.<small>M.P.</small>My love called out to me, and said:"Rise up, dear mate, my lovely one,and come forth. Look!

Jewish sources have understood <i>Shir Hashirim</i> as a love dia-logue between the community of Israel and its God. According to mid-rash,* Israel is the beautiful dark servant-girl coming forth from the wil-derness after she is redeemed from Egypt. She and her divine lover seekone another, whisper terms of endearment, call out in voices of longing,and rejoice as they approach their sacred union.
