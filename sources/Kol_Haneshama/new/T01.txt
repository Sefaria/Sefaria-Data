The /ITKabbalat Shabbat/XX service was created by the Kabbalists
(Jewish mystics) of Safed in the sixteenth century and was
almost universally accepted by Jewish communities. Though a
relatively recent innovation in Jewish liturgy, it probably springs
from ancient customs such as those of R. H/±anina and R. Yanay
(third century Palestine). The Talmud records that at sunset on
Shabbat eve, R. H/±anina would stand dressed in fine garments
and say, "Come, let us go forth to welcome the Sabbath queen."
R. Yanay, in festive attire, would exclaim, "Come, Oh bride!
Come, Oh bride!"/PR

The augmented version of /ITKabbalat Shabbat/XX presented here is
intended to offer variety within a traditional form of worship.
The prayer-leader (/ITsheliah/± tzibur/XX) should construct a service by
selecting elements from among the introductory hymns,
passages from the Song of Songs, Psalms, and additional readings
to be found below. For additional readings see pages 732-766./PR

הקדצ//ITtzedakah/XX. As God created for six days, so too do we labor. Just before
Shabbat--the time of divine and human rest--begins, some of us engage
in /ITtzedakah/XX to complete the work of renewing creation. The root letters
of the word /ITtzedakah/XX translate as "justice" or "righteousness." By giving
to those in need, we help to right a wrong and thus share responsibility
for creation. In some homes the /ITpushka/XX or /ITtzedakah/XX box stands next to the
Shabbat candles to receive the last coins of our workaday lives./PR

/PR

Some families may direct their /ITtzedakah/XX to a particular charity, organiza-
tion, or cause. Family discussion and reconsideration of choices from time
to time may heighten the meaning of the act. Some households create
their own /ITpushka/XX and adorn it with biblical verses and illustration./PR

/PR

Rabbi Elazar would always give a coin to a poor person before praying. In
explanation he would quote, "I shall behold your face /ITbetzedek/XX, in
righteousness" (Psalm 17:15)./PR

The physical motions associated with candlelighting are unique to each of
us and take on individual meaning. Some lift their hands over the flames
and toward themselves as though drawing the light of Shabbat into them-
selves. Others lift their hands over the flames six times as though to incor-
porate each day of the week into Shabbat./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. /ITYedid Nefesh/XX was written by Rabbi Eleazar Azikri of Safed.
A love song of the soul to God, it achieved great popularity in Sephardic
communities, where it was included in the daily prayerbook. H/±asidic cus-
tom adopted it for use as an introduction to Shabbat. The poet speaks to
God in most intimate terms as lover and parent, but also as shining light
of the universe. The longing for God is fulfilled for "the time has come"
as God spreads over the world the great /ITsukkat shalom/XX, canopy of peace,
which is Shabbat./PR

/PR

The traditional Hebrew text of /ITYedid Nefesh/XX presented here differs in
several places from Azikriòs original. Most notably, this version substitutes
in the second verse "Eternal her delight" for "She shall be your hand-
maiden forever." Here tradition seems to have improved on the authoròs
work!/PR

Eleazar Azikri (translated by Zalman Schachter-Shalomi)/XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The first letter of each verse spells out הוהי, the four-letter
name of God. That name subsumes and unites all the descriptions which
Jewish tradition has evolved in its quest for the divine. Jews may once have
commonly pronounced הוהי, but they have avoided doing so since at least
the third century /SC/XXB.C.E./XX The traditional vocalization "Yahweh" can be
understood as, "He causes to exist," or just, "He is!" It also resembles Godòs
enigmatic words to Moses at the burning bush: "/ITEhyeh Asher Ehyeh/XX--I Am
Who I am" (Exodus 3:14). Thus הוהי hints at the absurdity of assigning a
name to an ineffable divinity./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The historical origins of the love poems that comprise /ITShir
Hashirim/XX (The Song of Songs) is unknown. Were they simple shepherd
love poetry, as they present themselves, or did they have a cultic setting
in the distant pre-Israelite past, as some have suggested? The Kabbalists
prescribed the recitation of the Song of Songs at /ITKabbalat Shabbat/XX. They
saw it as a love poem between the blessed Holy One and the /ITSheh/±inah/XX, or
the male and female elements within divinity. Only in the union of these

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The term Sheh/±inah is an expansion of the biblical concept
of /ITKevod HaShem/XX òה דובכ, the manifest presence of God. In post-biblical
literature Sheh/±inah, which derives from the root ןכש, to dwell, came to
mean the feminine, in-dwelling experience of God. Jewish mystical litera-
ture elaborated this image of the Sheh/±inah as feminine. Mystics thus saw
the unity of the divine realm as dependent upon the healing union of
Godòs transcendent (masculine) and immanent (feminine) aspects. It was
believed that the people Israel can promote this healing through prayer
and Torah. The rabbis understood this union between masculine and femi-
nine, God and Israel, King and Sheh/±inah, to be at the heart of /ITShir

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Jewish sources have understood /ITShir Hashirim/XX as a love dia-
logue between the community of Israel and its God. According to mid-
rash,* Israel is the beautiful dark servant-girl coming forth from the wil-
derness after she is redeemed from Egypt. She and her divine lover seek
one another, whisper terms of endearment, call out in voices of longing,
and rejoice as they approach their sacred union. To Rabbi Akiva is
attributed the astonishing assertion, "All of Scripture is holy, but the Song
of Songs is the Holy of Holies!"/PR

*Midrash is a genre of interpretative commentary that derives its name
from the root שרד: to seek or search out. The activity of expounding mid-
rash is one of elucidation through creative expansion of words, verses, or
whole stories that are ambiguous in the biblical text. These provide fertile
ground for imaginative explanation. Midrashic literature dates back to the
period of the early Amoraic rabbis, ca. 400 /SC/XXC.E./XX, and is still being created
today./PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. One may read the Song of Songs as a poem reconciling disparate,
often polarized aspects of each human soul. Shelomo and Shulamit (whose
names mean peace and wholeness) are symbols of unification. We must
not hide from light our darkest, most passionate, most aroused and sensual
parts. Male and female, maiden and royalty, palace and field, blossom and
fruit, animals, birds and plants all draw into harmony on this day of inclu-
sive, overflowing love and self-acceptance./PR
