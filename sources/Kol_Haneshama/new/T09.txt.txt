BIRḤOT HASHAḤAR/MORNING BLESSINGS/HN/KABIRḤOT HASHAḤAR / MORNING BLESSINGSThis translation can be sung to the same melody as the Hebrew.How lovely are your tents, O Ya'akov,how fine your encampments, Yisrael!And as for me, drawn by your love,I come into your house.I lay me down in a humble surrender,before your holy shrine in awe.G<small>REAT </small>O<small>NE</small>, how I love your house's site,adore your Glory's dwelling place.And as for me, I fall in prayer,my body I bend down,I greet, I bless, I bend the knee,before THE ONE who fashions me.And as for me, my prayer is for you, GENTLE ONE,may it be for you a time of desire,O God, in the abundance of your love,respond to me in truth with your help.N<small>OTE</small>. The <i>Mah Tovu</i> prayer is composed entirely of biblical verses: Num-bers 24:5; Psalms 5:8, 95:6 [adapted] and 69:14.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. <i>Mah Tovu</i> begins with a historical progression--the tentsof our earliest ancestors, then the sanctuary of the years of wandering inthe wilderness, then the Temple in Jerusalem. Each of these is linked tothe synagogue, for it too is "your house." And I, the contemporary soul,seeking the right moment to encounter the divine there, am thus notalone. I am a link in the chain of tradition bearing the truth of yoursalvation.

It is only a true and close community that develops associations,traditions and memories that go to make up its soul. To mingle one's per-sonality with that soul becomes a natural longing. In such a communityone experiences that mystic divine grace which, like radiant sunshine, illu-mines our lives when joyous and, like balm, heals them when woundedor stricken. Then all questions about saying this or that become trivial, forthe real purpose is attained in having each one feel with the Psalmist:"One thing I ask of God that will I seek after, that I may dwell in thehouse of God all the days of my life, to behold the graciousness of God."<small>M.M.K. (ADAPTED)</small>יתליפת ינאו / as for me, my prayer is for you. The Hebrew text has oftenbeen creatively misread to mean "I am my prayer." All I have to offer inprayer is myself. We begin our prayers with a feeling of humility, knowingthat the vaunted words we are about to speak are no greater than the per-son who speaks them. Most of the prayers in our liturgy are phrased inthe first person plural, in which <i>we</i> as a community stand before theDivine presence. But here they are introduced in the halting and some-what unsure voice of the individual, expressing some of that inadequacythat each of us feels as we enter the place and hour of prayer.    A.G./KAATIFAT TALLIT / DONNING THE TALLITIt is customary to wrap oneself in the tallit before reciting the blessing that follows. After theblessing is recited, the tallit is placed across the shoulders. In some congregations the blessingis said in unison.Bless, O my soul, THE ONE!A<small>BUNDANT </small>O<small>NE</small>, my God, how great you grow!In majesty and beauty you are dressed,wrapping yourself in light as in a garment,stretching out the heavens like a shawl!    (Psalm 104:1-2)Blessed are You, VEILED ONE, our God, the sovereign of allworlds, who has made us holy with your mitzvot, andcommanded us to wrap ourselves amid the fringed tallit.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. According to rabbinic tradition, Psalm 104:1-2 describeshow God, robed in splendor, wrapped in light, began to create the world.The radiance of God's light-robe (one source says that God donned a whitetallit) illumined the world before the creation of sun, moon, and stars. Thismeditation invites the worshipper to consider the act of donning the tallitto be the first step in the daily renewal of the world. God's wrapping inlight becomes Israel's enlightened wrapping at the outset of a new day. Itencourages Israel to celebrate world renewing creativity as an unfailingsign of the divine presence within humankind.    S.S.D<small>ERASH</small>. The tallit is a very personal ritual object. Usually I wrap it aroundmyself when joining in a prayer community. For the tallit both creates aprivate space for me and links me with Jewish tradition. It emphasizes myconnection to my people while also offering me spiritual privacy. I amalone and in community at the same time.

(Psalm 36:8-11)D<small>ERASH</small>. The tallit is a "garment of brightness." It links us with the wholeuniverse, with the whole of Nature. The blue thread within it (Numbers15:37-41) reminds us that heaven and earth can touch, that the elementsof our universe are all wondrously connected.    L.B.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. The wearing of the tallit has its origins in the biblical com-mandment (Numbers 15:37-41) that a fringe should be attached to eachcorner of a garment to remind the Israelites of the mitzvot. This garment,resembling a poncho, was the basic garment worn every day. When cloth-ing without such defined corners came to be customary, the tallit becamea special ritual garment. In our time, a large tallit is worn only during themorning prayer, while traditional Jews wear a small tallit, also known as<i>arba kanfot</i> / four corners, underneath their outer clothes. In the biblicalcommandment the fringe was a color called תלכת / <i>teḥelet</i>, a particularshade of purple-blue. When this was no longer available, the rabbis ruledthat the fringes should be an undyed white. Some contemporary Jews havereinstituted the inclusion of blue in the fringe. Today in Reconstructionistcongregations, women are encouraged to wear tallitot as well.<small>D.A.T.</small>/HYמַּה יָּקָר חַסְדְּךָ אֱלֹהִים וּבְנֵי אָדָם בְּצֵל כְּנָפֶיךָ יֶחֱסָיוּן:יִּרְוְיֻן מִֽֽֽדֶּשֶׁן בֵּיֽֽֽתֶךָ וְֽֽֽנַחַל עֲדָֽֽֽנֶיךָ תַשְׁקֵם:ּכִּי עִמְּךָ מְקוֹר חַיִּים בְּאוֹרְךָ נִרְאֶה אוֹר:מְּשֹׁךְ חַסְדְּךָ לְיֹדְֽֽֽעֶיךָ וְצִדְקָתְךָ לְיִשְׁרֵי לֵב:/HNםייח רוקמ ךמע יכ / for with you is the fountain of all life, in your light dowe behold all light. The flow of light represented by the tallit is joined tothe blessing of life itself. God is described here in the psalmist's most deli-cate and abstract phrasing. We reach forth to the source of life and arebathed in its light as it flows forth to meet us.    A.G./KASHIREY SHAḤAR / MORNING SONGSOne of the following introductory poems may be added here.IMorning I will seek you,my fortress rock, each day.My song of dawn and duskbefore you I shall lay.I stand before your greatness,with trembling I'm fraught,because your eyes can entermy heart's most secret way.What can be done, by heartor tongue, what can one do or say?And how much strength lies deepwithin my body as I pray?And yet you find it good--mere human song--and so,I thank you for as long as shallyour lifebreath in me play.Solomon ibn Gabirol/HY/CAשִׁירֵי שַׁחַרOne of the following introductory poems may be added here.Iּֽֽֽשַׁחַר אֲבַקֶּשְׁךָ צוּרִי וּמִשְׂגַּבִּיאֶּעְרֹךְ לְפָֽֽֽנֶיךָ שַׁחְרִי וְגַם עַרְבִּי:לִּפְנֵי גְדֻלָּתָךְ אֶעְמֹד וְאֶבָּהֵלּכִּי עֵינְךָ תִרְאֶה כָּל מַחְשְׁבוֹת לִבִּי:מַּה-זֶּה אֲשֶׁר יוּכַל הַלֵּב וְהַלָּשׁוֹןלַּעְשׂוֹת וּמַה-ֽֽֽכֹּחַ רוּחִי בְּתוֹךְ קִרְבִּי:הִּנֵּה לְךָ תִיטַב זִמְרַת אֱנוֹשׁ עַל-כֵּןאּוֹדָךְ בְּעוֹד תִּהְיֶה נִשְׁמַת אֱֽֽֽלוֹהַּ בִּי:/HNךשקבא רחש / Morning I will seek you. The <i>Shaḥarit</i> service, as its nameimplies, was originally meant to be recited at dawn. Our tradition viewsthe two daily times of change of light as sacred hours to be appreciatedwith prayer and inner quiet. Though our morning service usually beginslong after sunrise, we should try to preserve something of that specialmemory of dawn's quiet blessing as we begin our prayer.    A.G.IIMy heart's a place for you, as you are mine.Remembering you, I hail, nighttime, daytime,I praise you, Holy One, my crown divine,cure of my soul, to my thirst quench sublime.I walk amid your light, unto your room,and from your precious glow my clothes I find,and, happy serving you, my place assume,in dread filled joy of you, perfect and kind.My God, glory and love around me bloom,my wish is seeing you, outside dream's time,for you my passion burns, my whole life through,my want is to ascend, these heavens climb.Anonymousךמוקמ יבבל / My heart's a place for you, as you are mine. The journey toGod is a journey inward rather than upward. We think more easily of aGod who dwells within the human soul than we do of one in the sky oron a mountain. Here the poet reminds us that while God is indeed in us,we are also "inside" God. The Hebrew word <i>makom</i> or "place" is one ofour ancient names for the divine. "God is the place of the world," said therabbis, "but the world is not God's place," meaning that the divine cannotbe contained within the finite. In the spirit of this poem, we might chooseto say that the inwardness with which we seek God and the inwardnesswith which the divine seeks us is the same inwardness.    A.G./HYIIלְּבָבִי מְקוֹמָךְ וְאַתָּה מְקוֹמִיּבְּזִכְרָךְ אֲהַלֵּל בְּלֵילִי וְיוֹמִי:שְׁבָחָךְ קְדוֹשִׁי עֲֽֽֽטֶרֶת לְרֹאשִׁיוְּרִפְאוּת לְנַפְשִׁי וְשִׁקּוּי לְעַצְמִי:מְּהַלֵּךְ בְּאוֹרָךְ לְֽֽֽנֹכַח דְּבִירָךְּוּמֵהוֹד יְקָרָךְ לְבוּשִׁי וְעָצְמִי:וְּאֶשְׂמַח בְּעָבְדָךְ בְּעָמְדִי לְנֶגְדָּךְוְּאֶשְׂמַח בְּפַחְדָּךְ בְּחַסְדָּךְ שְׁלוֹמִי:אֱּלֹהַי כְּבוֹדָךְ סְבִיבִי וְחַסְדָּךְוְחֶפְצִי רְאוֹתָךְ וְלֹא בַחֲלוֹמִי:לְּךָ תַאֲוָתִי בְּחַיַּי וּמוֹתִיוְחֶפְצִי עֲלוֹתִי לְגָבְהֵי מְרוֹמִי:/HNFor the sake of the union of the blessed Holy One with theSheḥinah, I stand here, ready in body and mind, to take uponmyself the mitzvah, "You shall love your fellow human beingas yourself," and by this merit may I open up my mouth:C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. This <i>kavanah</i> before the morning service was introducedby the kabbalists of Safed. Only by accepting upon ourselves the obligationto love others as ourselves are we allowed to enter the human communityof prayer. It is as members of that community and, specifically, as Jewsthat we come before God in worship.
