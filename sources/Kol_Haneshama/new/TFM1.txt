It draws upon the talentsof a myriad of nameless Jewish liturgists as well as many dozensof poets and commentators.

Mel Scult hasprovided comments from the published and unpublished writingof Mordecai Kaplan. Seth Riemer has helped faithfully withliturgical research, literary permissions, paste-ups and othereditorial tasks. Cantors David Tilman and Elizabeth Bolton haveguided my choices of <i>nusaḥ</i> and <i>zemirot</i>. Ezra Spicehandlergraciously consulted regarding Hebrew poetry. AlvinSchultzberg of The Town House Press has guided the book'sdesign, typesetting and printing. Deborah Brin and LeeFriedlander have again served brilliantly in selecting readings.Joel Rosenberg has brought his wondrous poet's ear to the taskof translation. Betsy Platkin Teutsch has again enhanced thebook through her artistic vision. Reena Spicehandler has laboreddiligently and good naturedly for years in developing the book'smanuscript.
