/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. Public worship aids us by liberating personality from the con-
fining walls of the individual ego. Imprisoned in self, we easily fall prey
to morbid broodings. Interference with career, personal disappointment
and disillusionment, hurts to vanity, the fear of death--all these tend so
to dominate our attention that our minds move in a fixed and narrow sys-
tem of ideas, which we detest but from which we see no escape. With a
whole wide world of boundless opportunities about us, we permit our
minds, as it were, to pace up and down within the narrow cell of their
ego-prisons. But participation in public worship breaks through the prison
of the ego and lets in the light and air of the world. Instead of living but
one small and petty life, we now share the multitudinous life of our peo-
ple. Against the wider horizons that now open to our ken, personal cares
do not loom so large. Life becomes infinitely more meaningful and worth-
while when we become aware, through our participation in public wor-
ship, of a common life that transcends our individual selves./PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. When we are about to say: "Blessed are you, our God, sovereign
of all worlds," and prepare to utter the first word "blessed," we should do
so with all our strength, so that we will have no strength left to say, "are
you." And this is the meaning of the verse in the Scriptures: "But they
that wait for God shall exchange their strength." What we are really say-
ing is: "Source of life, I am giving you all the strength that is within me
in that very first word; now will you, in exchange, give me an abundance
of new strength, so that I can go on with my prayer."    /SC/XXM.B. (ADAPTED)/XX/PR

םיברע בירעמ ורבדב רשא / By whose word the evenings fall. The word plays
a central role in the Jewish imagination. Our liturgy fantasizes that God
brings on evening each night by saying "Evening!" Thus we repeat each
day the original act of Creation that took place by means of the divine
word. It is only because we affirm a God who so values language that we
feel ourselves able to use words in prayer. Our word, perhaps like Godòs,
gives expression to a depth that goes beyond language, but that can be
shared only through the symbolic power of speech.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The two /ITberah/±ot/XX which precede the Shema set the stage for
its evening recitation. The first /ITberah/±ah/XX praises God for the wonders of
creation that are visible at twilight: the shifting patterns of the stars, the
rhythm of the seasons, the regular passage from day to night. All of these
are a nightly reminder of the unchanging plan of creation./PR

/PR

The second /ITberah/±ah/XX praises God, whose instruction is a special token of
love for Israel. Israel responds by meditating upon Godòs teaching "day
and night," "when we lie down and when we rise." This phrasing recalls
the preceding /ITberah/±ah/XX, adding Israelòs study of Torah to the natural order:
The sun sets, the stars shine, and Israel studies--as regularly as day and
night. The phrase "when we lie down and when we rise" anticipates the
Shema, which follows. This interplay between the /ITberah/±ot/XX and the Shema
suggests that the Shema is Israelòs morning and evening Torah study. At
the same time, it is Israelòs declaration of the oneness of the power that
makes for the natural order and for learning, for creation and human
creativity.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/KAINTERPRETIVE VERSION: ASHER BIDVARO/XX/PR

Praised are you, God, ruler of the universe, who has ordained
the rhythm of life. The day with its light calls to activity and
exertion. But when the day wanes, when, with the setting of
the sun, colors fade, we cease from our labors and welcome the
tranquility of the night. The subdued light of the moon and
stars, the darkness and the stillness about us invite rest and
repose. Trustfully we yield to the quiet of sleep, for we know
that, while we are unaware of what goes on within and around
us, our powers of body and mind are renewed. Therefore, at this
evening hour, we seek composure of spirit. We give thanks for
the day and its tasks and for the night and its rest. Praised are
you, God, who brings on the evening./PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. The traditional second paragraph of the Shema (Deuteronomy
11:13-21) offers an account of the natural process by which the blessings
of God themselves lead to pride, self-satisfaction, and ingratitude on the
part of those who receive them. Ironically, the more we are blessed, so it
seems, the less grateful and aware of blessing we become. It is when we
are most sated, Scripture warns us, that we should be most careful. Fullness
can lead to ingratitude, and ingratitude to idolatry--primarily in the form
of worship of our own accomplishments. Then, indeed, "the heavens
might close up and no rain fall." For, once we begin to worship our
achievements, we will never find satisfaction.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

So place these words upon your heart, into your lifebreath. Bind
them as a sign upon your hand, and let them rest before your
eyes. Teach them to your children, speaking of them when you
sit at home, and when you walk upon the road, when you lie
down, and when you rise. Inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates--so that your days and your childrenòs
days be many on the land /SCT/XXHE /XXF/XXAITHFUL /XXO/XXNE/XX promised to give
your ancestors, as long as heaven rests above the earth./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The statement of Godòs oneness unifies not only the con-
text of Shema but the text as well--three scriptural paragraphs specified
in the Mishnah (a second century codification of Jewish law). The power-
ful declaration of Godòs unity fuses the responsibility to love God and to
study Godòs teachings (first paragraph) with the lesson that their fulfill-
ment confirms Godòs presence (second and third paragraphs). Hence, the
unity of God as idea and presence.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. In the ancient Near East, free people wore fringes, or
/ITtzitzit/XX, on the hems of their everyday clothes. Since only free people wore
/ITtzitzit/XX, they were a form of identification. Business transactions were sealed
by kissing the /ITtzitzit/XX./PR

/PR

The mitzvah of /ITtzitzit/XX is based on that ancient sign of freedom. The fringes
remind us that we voluntarily follow the way of God, who freed us from
Egyptian slavery. It is, literally, a string tied around our finger./PR

/PR

Today, many Jews who recite the Shema gather the four corners of their
tallitot (prayer shawls), hold the /ITtzitzit/XX, and kiss them at each mention of
the word תיציצ / /ITtzitzit/XX. This custom shows that we take these words seri-
ously, like a legal contract.    /SC/XXL.W.K./XX/PR

/PR

םירצמ / /ITMitzrayim/XX was the escaping Hebrewsò, not the Egyptiansò, name for
the land of Egypt: perhaps a slave-term, and probably not of Semitic ori-
gin, it has associations with the root ררצ, to be in distress, constricted, in
anguish, or in dire straits. This word powerfully evokes the choking
oppression of slavery. As the psalmist wrote: הי יתארק רצמה ןמ / From the
depths I called to Yah.    /SC/XXM.P./XX/PR

ble. According to rabbinic tradition, there are 613 mitzvot in the Torah.
A combination of gematria (Jewish numerology) and ritual macrame
"proves" that תיציצ / /ITtzitzit/XX equals all 613 mitzvot combined: צ = 90, י =
10, צ = 90, י = 10, ת = 400; all together = 600. Each /ITtzitzit/XX has 8 strands

םכיניע ירחא / after what catches your eye, that is, the physical and material

תלכת is Sidon blue, which is obtained from a shellfish. Sidon or royal blue
is associated with majesty--even today the British queen wears a blue sash.
The Jews were so oppressed at the time of Bar Koh/±bah that indigo, a vege-
table dye, replaced Sidon blue on their /ITtzitzit/XX. The Romans banned the
blue fringe because of its symbolism. During the nineteenth century the
Radnizer /ITh/±asidim/XX reintroduced its use. Now other Jews have also begun to
use it. The long /ITteh/±elet/XX thread intertwined with short white ones is a com-
plex and powerful image that hints at the interplay between majesty and
subject within our own hearts.    /SC/XXE.M./XX/PR
