/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Six psalms, one for each weekday, open the traditional
/ITKabbalat Shabbat/XX service. The seventh element, the Shabbat psalm, is intro-
duced by the song /ITLeh/±ah Dodi/XX, "Come, My Friend." As Shabbat eve drew
near, the Safed Kabbalists used to walk into the fields at the edge of their
mountain village in order to greet the day of rest. There they could survey
the beauty of creation apparent in the panorama spread before them:
mountain, valley, forest, sky, and sea. Through the preceding psalms they
gave voice to their praise of creation, and they honored Shabbat with spe-
cially composed hymns sung as they escorted Shabbat to their homes./PR

/PR

/ITLeh/±ah Dodi/XX--a hymn to honor and escort Shabbat--was composed by
Shelomo Halevi Alkabetz, a member of the Safed Kabbalists. The initial
letters of the poemòs first eight stanzas spell out his name: ו . The
opening refrain and closing verse of the poem reflect the customs of R.
H/±anina and R. Yanay. Their images of Shabbat as queen and bride combine
to link the formal and intimate aspects of Shabbat, the source of all bless-
ing and ultimate intention of creation./PR

/PR

The hymn draws heavily upon prophecies of Israelòs redemption and
renewal in the messianic era--likened, in Jewish tradition, to a Shabbat
without end. Shabbat stands in relation to the week as the messianic era
stands in relation to the flow of world time. It is at once a celebration of
the worldòs beginning and a foretaste of the world to come, a reservoir of
past and future held in a single moment.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCN/XXOTE/XX. The first stanza of /ITLeh/±ah Dodi/XX attempts to reconcile two versions
(in the Ten Commandments) of the mitzvah to observe Shabbat. The
integrity of both "remember the Sabbath day" (Exodus 20:8) and "keep
the Sabbath day" (Deuteronomy 5:12) is maintained when the song pro-
claims that God--in whom all things unite--uttered both simultaneously
(Babylonian Talmud, Shevuot 20b).    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Shabbat is here depicted in a glorious array of symbols that
derive from the many terms Kabbalistic tradition has used to describe the
Sheh/±inah. She is the bride, the queen, Jerusalem the holy city too long
prisoner in the vale of tears, the people Israel about to be crowned with
the glory of God. All of these draw together in the single figure of Shabbat
as we welcome her into our hearts.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

םוב וב / /ITBoòi veshalom/XX, the last verse of /ITLeh/±ah Dodi/XX, should be recited
outdoors. Where this is not possible, a turn toward the doorway is tradi-
tional. At /ITBoòi h/±alah/XX (Come in, O bride), we receive into ourselves the
/ITneshamah yeterah/XX, an extra measure of soul, that is not present to us during
the week. This extra Shabbat soul may be viewed as the greater sensitivity
allowed us by the restful and unpressured pace of Shabbat. Indeed, that
extra soul may be inside us all the time, and /ITLeh/±ah Dodi/XX may be seen as a
love song that coaxes our most sensitive self to come out of hiding, in the
assurance that on Shabbat it will not be harmed or threatened.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

*Midrash is a genre of interpretative commentary that derives its name
from the root ר: to search out. The activity of expounding midrash is
one of elucidation through creative expansion of words, verses, or whole
stories that are ambiguous in the biblical text. These provide fertile ground
for imaginative explanation. Midrashic literature dates back to the period
of the early Amoraic rabbis, ca. 400 /SC/XXC.E./XX, and is still being created today./PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. Why does this psalm (93) follow the psalm for Shabbat (92)? In
it God watches the seas. The midrash notes that just as earth was created
by parting the waters, so was Redemption created by parting the waters.
In Creation land was redeemed from the waters. In Redemption human
freedom is created. The creation of Shabbat planted the seed of human
redemption. The experience of Shabbat nurtures that seed, giving us the
strength to quell the floods in our time.    /SC/XXD.A.T./S.D.R./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Psalm 93 concludes /ITKabbalat Shabbat/XX by retelling the
ancient tale of Creation. The waters raised a great shout, showing their
power to overwhelm the dry land as it first emerged. So do the forces of
chaos and destruction threaten the islands of peace and security we manage
to create in our lives. The psalmist assures us, however, that the voice of
God is greater than that of even the fiercest storm tides of the ocean. With
Godòs throne firmly established, the peace of Shabbat is now
triumphant.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR
