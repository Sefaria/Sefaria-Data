READINGS: PRAYERREADINGS: PRAYER/HNThe Sabbath expresses for modern Jews, as it did for theirancestors, the thought that the world is so constituted that wecan achieve salvation if, by adhering to valid ideals, we putourselves in contact with the creative forces that shape life andmake it worth living. Since we identify God with that aspect ofreality which gives to life its supreme value or holiness, this isbut another way of saying in more traditional language that theSabbath expresses for us the faith that humanity can achievesalvation by cleaving to God, the Source of salvation.But the Sabbath is not only a symbol of the salvation to beachieved by communion with God. It is itself an instrument thatwe may employ to advantage in our pursuit of salvation. Weneed perhaps more than ever before to terminate each week witha day that shall stimulate our thirst for salvation and keep usfaithful to the ideals that lead to its attainment. Otherwise ourmere preoccupation with the business of "making a living," thatis, of securing the conditions indispensable to life, tends toabsorb all our attention, and life itself becomes empty andmeaningless. We work to keep alive that we may work to keepalive, until our powers are spent in this weary treadmill, anddeath brings surcease of labor. If life is to be lived zestfully, andto employ all those human faculties the full exercise of whichcalls forth true joy in being alive, we dare not permit life to sinkto such a level of mere preoccupation with the problem ofsurvival. The Sabbath, with its insistence upon interrupting theroutine of our daily business and concerning ourselves withspiritual values, helps to save us from such a fate.Mordecai M.

Prayer isa step on which we rise from the self we are to the self we wishto be. Prayer is not an escape from duty. It is no substitute forthe deed. Prayer seeks the power to do wisely, to act generously,to live helpfully. Prayer takes us beyond the self. Joining ourlittle self to the selfhood of humanity, it gives our wishes thefreedom to grow large and broad and inclusive. Our prayers areanswered not when we are given what we ask, but when we arechallenged to be what we can be.Morris Adler (adapted)A long time ago, before anything had a name, we didn't knowthat we were man or woman, human or animal, male or female.When the wild reeds bowed their heads in the wind, we bowedour heads too, for it was the same spirit--breath that breathedthrough us every second, every hour, every day of our lives. Atdawn when the brilliant orange squash blossoms opened gently,gently at the first warm kiss of sun, we too opened our eyes anduncurled from sleep, stretching wide, stretching far, rejoicing asevery part of our bodies came to life again. And when the rainscame forth, loving Earth so much that she grew fruits andberries and nuts to feed us with, we were full of her joy and weloved each other and we grew our own children to eat Earth'sjoys, her fruits, so that the rains would come again and visit her.It was before we were called man or woman, even before wecould speak one word. In those days we prayed with our entirebeings, in the wind, in the sun, in the rain; every second, everyday, every hour of our lives; at the rising of the sun and the darkof the moon, at the birth of the son and the death of thegrandmother, at the wedding of two lovers, at the buzzing ofthe Spring. We breathed, we bowed, we laughed, we wept. Thiswas before we called it prayer.Penina V. AdelmanLook at this day,For it is life,The very life of life.In its brief course lie allThe realities and verities of existence,The bliss of growth,The splendor of action,The glory of power--For yesterday is but a dream,And tomorrow is only a vision.But today, well lived,Makes every yesterday a dream of happinessAnd every tomorrow a vision of hope.Look well, therefore, to this day.Sanskrit ProverbStrange is our situation here upon earth. Each of us comes for ashort visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to divinea purpose. From the standpoint of daily life, however, there isone thing we do know: that we are here for the sake of eachother, above all, for those upon whose smile and well-being ourown happiness depends, and also for the countless unknownsouls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy.Many times a day I realize how much my own outer and innerlife is built upon the labors of others, both living and dead, andhow earnestly I must exert myself in order to give in return asmuch as I have received and am still receiving.Albert Einstein (adapted)Prayer is not a stratagem for occasional use, a refuge to resort tonow and then. It is rather like an established residence for theinnermost self. All things have a home, the bird has a nest, thefox has a hole, the bee has a hive. A soul without prayer is asoul without a home. Weary, sobbing, the soul, after roamingthrough a world festered with aimlessness, falsehoods andabsurdities, seeks a moment in which to gather up its scatteredlife, in which to divest itself of enforced pretensions andcamouflage, in which to simplify complexities, in which to callfor help without being a coward. Such a home is prayer.Continuity, permanence, intimacy, authenticity, earnestness areits attributes. For the soul, home is where prayer is.In her cottage, even the poorest person may bid defiance tomisery and malice. That cottage may be frail, its roof may shake,the wind may blow through it, the storms may enter it, but thereis where the soul expects to be understood. Just as the body, sois the soul in need of a home.Everybody must build his own home; everybody must guard theindependence and the privacy of her prayers. It is the source ofsecurity for the integrity of conscience, for whatever inkling weattain of eternity. At home I have a parent who judges and cares,who has regard for people, and when I fail and go astray, missesme. I will never give up my home.What is a soul without prayer? A soul runaway or a soul evictedfrom its own home. To those who have abandoned their home,the road may be hard and dark and far, yet do not be afraid tosteer back. If you prize grace and eternal meaning, you willdiscover them upon arrival./PIHow marvelous is my home. I enter as a supplicant and emergeas a witness; I enter as a stranger and emerge as next of kin. Imay enter spiritually shapeless, inwardly disfigured, and emergewholly changed. It is in moments of prayer that my image isforged, that my striving is fashioned. To understand the worldI must love my home. It is difficult to perceive luminosityanywhere if there is no light in my own home. It is in the lightof prayer's radiance that I find my way even in the dark. It isprayer that illumines my way. As my prayers, so is myunderstanding.Abraham Joshua Heschel (adapted)There are times when you must prepare yourselfbefore you can pray.Reciting Psalms or studying Torah before prayermay provide the strength you need.But take care also to avoid giving yourself too fullyto these preparations,lest they consume all your strengthand leave no room for prayer itself.* *Enter into prayer slowly.Do not exhaust your strength,but proceed step by step.Even if you are not aroused as your prayer begins,give close attention to the words you speak.As you grow in strengthand God helps you to draw near,you can even say the words more quicklyand remain in God's Presence./PI* *Put all your strength into the wordsproceeding from letter to letterwith such concentrationthat you lose awareness of your bodily self.It will then seem to you that the letters themselvesare flowing into one another.This uniting of the letters is our greatest joy.If joy is felt as two human bodies come together,how much greater must be the joyof this union in spirit!* *Do not think that the words of prayeras you say themgo up to God.It is not the words themselves that ascend;it is rather the burning desire of your heartthat rises like smoke toward heaven.If your prayer consists only of words and letters,and does not contain your heart's desire--how can it rise up to God?Naḥman of Bratzlav (translated by Arthur Green and Barry Holtz)/KAA Sense of Your PresenceAmong our many appetitesThere is a craving after God.Among our many attributesThere is a talent for worshiping God.Jews who wandered in deserts beneath the starsKnew their hearts were hungry for God.Jews who studied in candle-lit ghetto roomsThirsted longingly after God.In tent or hut or slumJewish women prayed to God.But we who are smothered with comfortSometimes forget to listen.Help us, O God, to recognize our need,To hear the yearning whisper of our hearts.Help us to seek the silence of the desertAnd the thoughtfulness of the house of study.Bless us, like our ancestors in ancient daysWith that most precious gift: a sense of Your presence.Brush us with the wind of the wings of Your being.Fill us with the awe of Your holiness.We, too, will praise, glorify, and exalt Your name.Ruth Brin (adapted)/KAUntieDear God,We are bound with very tight knots.They choke off air and stop the blood from pulsating freely.The knots make us like computers with carefully controlledcircuitry.The knots in our brains tie our creativity--our link with You.We follow the knot around in its intricacy--but it remains aknot.The knots in our hearts keep us from crying and dancing whenwe long to--They tie us to the posts of the fences that separate us from eachother.The knots in our muscles keep our teeth clenched, our jawslocked, our legs crossed, our shoulders stooped, our backs bent,our chests from inhaling and exhaling the full sweetness of life'sbreath.O, God, untie all our knots!Sheila Peltz Weinberg/KATe DeumNot because of victoriesI sing,having none,but for the common sunshine,the breeze,the largess of the spring.Not for victorybut for the day's work doneas well as I was able;not for a seat upon the daisbut at the common

you, nobody hurries you.You walk toward your creatorwith gifts in pure, empty hands.The words are golden,their meaning is transparent,it's as though you're saying themfor the first time./PIIf you don't catch onthat you should feel a little elevated,you're not praying the sunset prayer.The tune is sheer simplicity,you're just lending a helping handto the sinking day.It's a heavy responsibility.You take a created dayand you slip itinto the archive of life,where all our lived-out days are lying together.The day is departing with a quiet kiss.It lies open at your feetwhile you stand saying the blessings.You can't create anything yourself, but youcan lead the day to its end and seeclearly the smile of its going down.See how whole it all is,not diminished for a second,how you age with the daysthat keep dawning,how you bring your lived-out dayas a gift to eternity.Jacob Glatstein (translated from the Yiddish by Ruth Whitman)/HYשְׁחִי לָאֵל יְחִידָה הַחֲכָמָהוְּֽֽֽרוּצִי
