Psalm 121/XX/PR

/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. Often prayer seeks to turn our thoughts towards God; at other
times it directs our attention towards ourselves, and sometimes these two
poles are held in intimate relation, as in the opening outcry of the psalm:
"I lift my eyes up to the hills: from where does my help come?" Had the
life-sustaining force we call God not been with us, how could we possibly
have survived calumny and contempt, pogroms and persecutions? Given
the perils and pains of Jewish history, our continued existence as a people
is not easy to account for in the usual reasoned terms of causal explanation./PR

/PR

Might we then succumb, if only for a moment, to the cry of the psalmist,
and give voice to our astonished recognition that our existence is surely
by the grace of God, a gift that surpasses explanation.    /SC/XXE.G./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. If we lift our eyes towards the mountains, be they rounded from
weathering or jaggedly youthful, their connecting of the molten innards
of earth with the luminous stretches of heaven arouses wonder at the dyna-
mism and eruptive creativity amidst which we live. Depths become
heights while hills are laid low, and the hardest of surfaces yields to the
softness of water and wind. Change is ceaseless, and transformation knows
no pause. The dynamism both exhilarates and exhausts the spirit; no won-
der that we seek stability amidst this endless process./PR

/PR

Many of this psalmòs readers may find such stability in the seemingly solid
image of the Maker of heaven and earth. But those whose ears are attuned
to mystical overtones may hear in the word ןיאמ / meòayin echoes of the
Creative Nothingness, the Divine Void, the AYIN, the Mysterious and
Ever Elusive Source from which all existence springs. The Name for that
Source--four letters without consonantal substance, the stirrings of breath
captured only in vowels--hints at stability amidst ceaseless process, a dizzy-
ing term of pure becoming. The paradox of this affirmation contributes
to the spiritual vertigo which may, along with the heights of the highest
peaks, help us sense that Source of our being that lies both above and
beneath our furthest seeing.    /SC/XXE.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Psalms 121 and 122 are included from the Sephardic rite.
They are part of a group of pilgrimsò songs, sung by our ancestors as they

strong in their faith, are classics of our ancient religious literature.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This psalm speaks in the past tense of the glories of Jerusa-
lem during the Davidic monarchy. The speaker recalls coming to Jerusa-
lem on pilgrimage when "the thrones of Davidòs house" stood in its midst.
What sort of spirituality could now flourish when the institutions that
had nourished the community in the past were no more? Like many Jewish
communities since, this one turned its energies to rebuilding and renewal.
Praying for the peace and well-being of all those that love Jerusalem was
then and is now a prayer for the continuity of Israelòs spiritual community.
Though the tribes are exiled and dispersed, Jerusalem can again become
"a city where all things converge."    /SC/XXH.L./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Psalms 121 and 122 are selections from the Psalms of
Ascent or the Psalms of Degrees, originally sung in the Temple. The
beginning of the upward path exists in the recognition of Godòs loving,
helpful presence in our lives (Psalm 121). God is with us when we behold
nature in its perfection and we become ready to acknowledge the possibil-
ity of communion with the power of Creation. Awareness of our access to
God offers us protection no matter how often we enter and leave the
ascending journey.    /SC/XXS.P.W./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. םיבידנב וחטבת לא / Trust not in human benefactors. At first the
message catches us off guard. Do not put your trust in other people. Even
leaders--born or chosen. Then we recall that ours is a program of sacred
principles, not sacred personalities. We should not rely on the good will
of even the noblest and most generous. (The root ב ד נ is the same for
noble and generous.) The principle of protecting the weak and defenseless
is far too important to entrust to any regime, ruler or promising politician.
It is a principle encoded in the very structure of the universe. It demands
our individual obedience.    /SC/XXS.P.W./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. ידועב יהלאל הרמזא ייחב הוהי הללהא / I shall praise the Lord with my
life, I shall sing to my God with my virtue/talent/gift. (R. Nah/±man of
Bratzlavòs rendering)./PR

/PR

Why do we find it so difficult to pray? What prevents us from praising
the Lord? Our lists would most likely emphasize intellectual and theologi-
cal obstacles; few would include R. Nah/±manòs audacious suggestion that a
key to the silence of our souls is that we think too little of ourselves. Our
low self-regard makes us feel inwardly unworthy to praise the beneficent
bestower of blessings upon humankind./PR

/PR

So, recommends R. Nah/±man, begin your preparation for prayer by focus-
ing on your דוֹע / /ITod/XX, on something worthy about yourself, a virtue, a tal-
ent, a personal quality perhaps overlooked or unappreciated. Concentrate
even a little on this דוֹע / /ITod/XX, and your sense of unworthiness will be dimin-
ished. In touch with this element of value in yourself--and even the worst
of sinners possesses goodness as well, Nah/±man assures--youòll find that
this merit, this דוֹע / /ITod/XX, recognized, will help you sing Godòs praises, and
that your life itself will utter a hymn of praise to God.    /SC/XXE.G./XX/PR

human emulation. The approach of predicate theology treats divine attri-
