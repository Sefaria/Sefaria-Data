PESUKEY DEZIMRAH/VERSES OF PRAISE/HNA Song for the Ascents.I lift my eyes up to the hills.from where does my help come?My help is from THE UNSEEN ONE,the maker of the heavens and the earth,who will not cause your foot to fail.Your protector never slumbers.Behold the one who slumbers not, who never sleeps,the guardian of Israel.T<small>HE </small>A<small>BUNDANT </small>O<small>NE</small> preserves you,T<small>HE </small>W<small>ATCHFUL </small>O<small>NE</small>, your shelter, at your right hand a support.By day, the sun will not afflict you,nor the moonlight by the night.T<small>HE </small>V<small>IGILANT</small> shall guard you from all evil,and will keep your lifebreath safe.T<small>HE </small>S<small>HEPHERD</small> guard your going out and coming in,from now unto eternity.Psalm 121K<small>AVANAH</small>. Often prayer seeks to turn our thoughts towards God; at othertimes it directs our attention towards ourselves, and sometimes these twopoles are held in intimate relation, as in the opening outcry of the psalm:"I lift my eyes up to the hills: from where does my help come?" Had thelife-sustaining force we call God not been with us, how could we possiblyhave survived calumny and contempt, pogroms and persecutions? Giventhe perils and pains of Jewish history, our continued existence as a peopleis not easy to account for in the usual reasoned terms of causal explanation.Might we then succumb, if only for a moment, to the cry of the psalmist,and give voice to our astonished recognition that our existence is surelyby the grace of God, a gift that surpasses explanation.    E.G./HYשִּׁיר לַמַּעֲלוֹת אֶשָּׂא עֵינַי אֶל-הֶהָרִים מֵֽֽֽאַיִן יָבֹא עֶזְרִי:עֶזְרִי מֵעִם יהוה עֹשֵׂה שָֽֽֽׁמַיִם וָֽֽֽאָרֶץ:אַּל-יִתֵּן לַמּוֹט רַגְֽֽֽלֶךָ אַל-יָנוּם שֹׁמְֽֽֽרֶךָ:הִּנֵּה לֹא-יָנוּם וְלֹא יִישָׁן שׁוֹמֵר יִשְׂרָאֵל:יּהוה שֹׁמְֽֽֽרֶךָ יהוה צִלְּךָ עַל-יַד יְמִיֽֽֽנֶךָ:יּוֹמָם הַֽֽֽשֶּׁמֶשׁ לֹא-יַֽֽֽכֶּכָּה וְיָֽֽֽרֵחַ בַּֽֽֽלָּיְלָה:יּהוה יִשְׁמָרְךָ מִכָּל-רָע יִשְׁמֹר אֶת-נַפְֽֽֽשֶׁךָ:יּהוה יִשְׁמָר-צֵאתְךָ וּבוֹֽֽֽאֶךָ מֵעַתָּה וְעַד-עוֹלָם:/HNEsa eynay el heharim me<u>'a</u>yin yavo ezri.Ezri me'im adonay oseh sha<u>ma</u>yim va'<u>a</u>retz.D<small>ERASH</small>. If we lift our eyes towards the mountains, be they rounded fromweathering or jaggedly youthful, their connecting of the molten innardsof earth with the luminous stretches of heaven arouses wonder at the dyna-mism and eruptive creativity amidst which we live. Depths becomeheights while hills are laid low, and the hardest of surfaces yields to thesoftness of water and wind. Change is ceaseless, and transformation knowsno pause. The dynamism both exhilarates and exhausts the spirit; no won-der that we seek stability amidst this endless process.Many of this psalm's readers may find such stability in the seemingly solidimage of the Maker of heaven and earth. But those whose ears are attunedto mystical overtones may hear in the word ןיאמ / me'ayin echoes of theCreative Nothingness, the Divine Void, the AYIN, the Mysterious andEver Elusive Source from which all existence springs. The Name for thatSource--four letters without consonantal substance, the stirrings of breathcaptured only in vowels--hints at stability amidst ceaseless process, a dizzy-ing term of pure becoming. The paradox of this affirmation contributesto the spiritual vertigo which may, along with the heights of the highestpeaks, help us sense that Source of our being that lies both above andbeneath our furthest seeing.    E.G.A Song of Ascents. Of David.I rejoiced whenever people said to me,let's journey to the house of THE UNSEEN!Our feet would standinside your gates, Jerusalem,Jerusalem, built up, a citywhere all things converge,the place to which the tribes would climb,the tribes of Yah,the place of Israel's witness,for acknowledging the name of THE ETERNAL.For there the seats of justice dwell,the thrones of David's house.So, let us say: Shalom, Yerushalayim,and let all who love you be consoled,great solace be upon your force,salvation's rest amid your halls,for all my kin, for all my friends,may I now speak: Shalom to you!And for the house of THE INDWELLING ONE, our God,I only seek your good.Psalm 122C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Psalms 121 and 122 are included from the Sephardic rite.They are part of a group of pilgrims' songs, sung by our ancestors as theywent up to the Temple. These two psalms, simple in their language andstrong in their faith, are classics of our ancient religious literature.    A.G./HYשִּׁיר הַמַּעֲלוֹת לְדָוִד שָֽֽֽׂמַחְתִּי בְּאֹמְרִים לִי בֵּית יהוה נֵלֵךְ:עֹּמְדוֹת הָיוּ רַגְֽֽֽלֵינוּ בִּשְׁעָֽֽֽרַיִךְ יְרוּשָֽֽֽׁלִָם:יְּרוּשָֽֽֽׁלִַם הַבְּנוּיָה כְּעִיר שֶׁחֻבְּרָה-לָּהּ יַחְדָּו:שֶּׁשָּׁם עָלוּ שְׁבָטִים שִׁבְטֵי-יָהּ עֵדוּת לְיִשְׂרָאֵל לְהֹדוֹת לְשֵׁם יהוה:ּכִּי ֽֽֽשָׁמָּה יָשְׁבוּ כִסְאוֹת לְמִשְׁפָּט כִּסְאוֹת לְבֵית דָּוִד:שַּׁאֲלוּ שְׁלוֹם יְרוּשָֽֽֽׁלִָם יִשְֽֽֽׁלָיוּ אֹהֲֽֽֽבָיִךְ:יְּהִי-שָׁלוֹם בְּחֵילֵךְ שַׁלְוָה בְּאַרְמְנוֹֽֽֽתָיִךְ:לְּֽֽֽמַעַן אַחַי וְרֵעָי אֲדַבְּרָה-נָּא שָׁלוֹם בָּךְ:*ּלְֽֽֽמַעַן בֵּית-יהוה אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ אֲבַקְשָׁה טוֹב לָךְ:/HNSha'alu shelom yerusha<u>la</u>yim yishlayu oha<u>vay</u>iḥ.Yehi shalom beḥeyleḥ shalvah be'armono<u>tay</u>iḥ.Le<u>ma</u>'an aḥay vere'ay adaberah--na shalom baḥ.Le<u>ma</u>'an beyt adonay elo<u>hey</u>nu avakshah tov laḥ.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. This psalm speaks in the past tense of the glories of Jerusa-lem during the Davidic monarchy. The speaker recalls coming to Jerusa-lem on pilgrimage when "the thrones of David's house" stood in its midst.What sort of spirituality could now flourish when the institutions thathad nourished the community in the past were no more? Like many Jewishcommunities since, this one turned its energies to rebuilding and renewal.Praying for the peace and well-being of all those that love Jerusalem wasthen and is now a prayer for the continuity of Israel's spiritual community.Though the tribes are exiled and dispersed, Jerusalem can again become"a city where all things converge."    H.L.C<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Psalms 121 and 122 are selections from the Psalms ofAscent or the Psalms of Degrees, originally sung in the Temple. Thebeginning of the upward path exists in the recognition of God's loving,helpful presence in our lives (Psalm 121). God is with us when we beholdnature in its perfection and we become ready to acknowledge the possibil-ity of communion with the power of Creation. Awareness of our access toGod offers us protection no matter how often we enter and leave theascending journey.    S.P.W.Halleluyah!Hail, my soul, THE OMNIPRESENT!I hail THE INNERMOST my whole life through,I sing out to my God as long as I endure.Trust not in human benefactors,in mortal beings, who have no power to help.Their spirit leaves, they go back to the ground,on that day, all their thoughts are lost.Happy is the one who has the God of Jacob for a help,whose hopeful thought is for THE LIVING ONE, our God,the maker of the heavens and the earth,the seas and all that they contain,the world's true guardian,/PID<small>ERASH</small>. םיבידנב וחטבת לא / Trust not in human benefactors. At first themessage catches us off guard. Do not put your trust in other people. Evenleaders--born or chosen. Then we recall that ours is a program of sacredprinciples, not sacred personalities. We should not rely on the good willof even the noblest and most generous. (The root ב ד נ is the same fornoble and generous.) The principle of protecting the weak and defenselessis far too important to entrust to any regime, ruler or promising politician.It is a principle encoded in the very structure of the universe. It demandsour individual obedience.    S.P.W.D<small>ERASH</small>. The God of religion is the God we can know and experienceevery time we choose to act in the spirit of moral responsibility by beingloyal, honest, just, sympathetic and creative.    M.M.K. (ADAPTED)/HY	ּהַלְלוּיָהּ	הַלְלִי נַפְשִׁי אֶת-יְהוָֹה:	ּאֲהַלְלָה יְהוָֹה בְּחַיָּי	אֲזַמְּרָה לֵאלֹהַי בְּעוֹדִי:	ּאַל-תִּבְטְחוּ בִנְדִיבִים	בְּבֶן-אָדָם שֶׁאֵין לוֹ תְשׁוּעָה:	ּתֵּצֵא רוּחוֹ יָשֻׁב לְאַדְמָתוֹ	בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא אָבְדוּ עֶשְׁתֹּנֹתָיו:	ּאַשְׁרֵי שֶׁאֵל יַעֲקֹב בְּעֶזְרוֹ	שִׂבְרוֹ עַל-יהוה אֱלֹהָיו:	ּעֹשֶׂה שָֽֽֽׁמַיִם וָֽֽֽאָרֶץ	אֶת-הַיָּם וְאֶת-כָּל אֲשֶׁר-בָּם	הַשֹּׁמֵר אֱמֶת לְעוֹלָם:/PH/HND<small>ERASH</small>. ידועב יהלאל הרמזא ייחב הוהי הללהא / I shall praise the Lord with mylife, I shall sing to my God with my virtue/talent/gift. (R. Naḥman ofBratzlav's rendering).Why do we find it so difficult to pray? What prevents us from praisingthe Lord? Our lists would most likely emphasize intellectual and theologi-cal obstacles; few would include R. Naḥman's audacious suggestion that akey to the silence of our souls is that we think too little of ourselves. Ourlow self-regard makes us feel inwardly unworthy to praise the beneficentbestower of blessings upon humankind.So, recommends R. Naḥman, begin your preparation for prayer by focus-ing on your דוֹע / <i>od</i>, on something worthy about yourself, a virtue, a tal-ent, a personal quality perhaps overlooked or unappreciated. Concentrateeven a little on this דוֹע / <i>od</i>, and your sense of unworthiness will be dimin-ished. In touch with this element of value in yourself--and even the worstof sinners possesses goodness as well, Naḥman assures--you'll find thatthis merit, this דוֹע / <i>od</i>, recognized, will help you sing God's praises, andthat your life itself will utter a hymn of praise to God.

The latter part of this psalm lists divine actions worthy ofhuman emulation. The approach of predicate theology treats divine attri-butes as models for human conduct. In praising God this way we are notattempting to make factual statements about God's conduct. We are statingvalues that we hope to make manifest through the way we lead ourlives.    D.A.T.Halleluyah! How good it is to sing out to our God!How much a pleasure and how fitting is our praise!The builder of Jerusalem is ZION'S GOD,may those of Israel gone astray be gathered there.The healer of the broken-hearted,the one who bandages their bones,who alone reckons the number of the stars,while giving names to every one of them--how great is our protector, and how powerful,whose understanding has no limit!T<small>HE </small>C<small>OMPASSIONATE</small> encourages the humble,and brings down the wicked to the earth,sing choruses of thanks to THE MAGNIFICENT,sing out to our God with instrument of strings,the one who covers up the sky with clouds,who prepares the rainfall for the earth,who causes grass to sprout upon the mountains,who gives the beast its sustenance,young ravens, what they clamor for,who is indifferent to the horse's power,who takes no pleasure in the muscle's might,/PI/HY	ּכִּי-טוֹב זַמְּרָה אֱלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ	כִּי-נָעִים נָאוָה תְהִלָּה:	ּבֹּנֵה יְרוּשָֽֽֽׁלַיִם יְהוָֹה	נִדְחֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל יְכַנֵּס:	ּהָרוֹפֵא לִשְֽֽֽׁבוּרֵי לֵב	וּמְחַבֵּשׁ לְעַצְּבוֹתָם:	ּמוֹנֶה מִסְפָּר לַכּוֹכָבִים	לְכֻלָּם שֵׁמוֹת יִקְרָא:	ּגָּדוֹל אֲדוֹֽֽֽנֵינוּ וְרַב-ֽֽֽכֹּחַ	לִתְבוּנָתוֹ אֵין מִסְפָּר:	ּמְעוֹדֵד עֲנָוִים יְהוָֹה	מַשְׁפִּיל רְשָׁעִים עֲדֵי-ֽֽֽאָרֶץ:	ּעֱנוּ לַיְהוָֹה בְּתוֹדָה	זַמְּרוּ לֵאלֹֽֽֽהֵינוּ בְכִנּוֹר:	ּהַמְכַסֶּה שָֽֽֽׁמַיִם בְּעָבִים	הַמֵּכִין לָֽֽֽאָרֶץ מָטָר	ּהַמַּצְֽֽֽמִיחַ הָרִים חָצִיר:	ּנוֹתֵן לִבְהֵמָה לַחְמָהּ	לִבְנֵי עֹרֵב אֲשֶׁר יִקְֽֽֽרָאוּ:	ּלֹא בִגְבוּרַת הַסּוּס יֶחְפָּץ	לֹא-בְשׁוֹקֵי הָאִישׁ יִרְצֶה:PּH/HNC<small>OMMENTARY</small>. Psalm 147 has three majestic interlacing themes. Thedivine is present in the ordered universe of galaxies and creatures. Thedivine is present, too, in the broken human heart, in those humbled byloss and disappointment. Finally, the divine is present in the capacity ofour senses and in our ability to appreciate the world around us.    S.P.W.T<small>HE </small>J<small>UST </small>O<small>NE</small> values only those in awe of God,only the ones who yearn for God's kind love.Give praise, Jerusalem, to THE ETERNAL,hail your God, O Zion,for God has fortified the bars upon your gates,has blessed your brood amid your breast,and sets your borderlands at peace,and satisfies you with the choicest wheat,the one who sends an utterance to earth,whose word runs swiftest in the world,the giver of a snow like fleece,who strews a frost like frigid ash.who casts down hail like crumbs of bread--before such chill, who can endure?--but who, with but a word, can melt them all,and by whose breath the waters flow.God tells the words of tale to Jacob,laws and judgments to the people Israel.Has God not done so for all nations?Are there any who do not know such laws?Halleluyah!Psalm 147/HY	ּרוֹצֶה יהוה אֶת-יְרֵאָיו	אֶת-הַמְיַחֲלִים לְחַסְדּוֹ:	ּשַׁבְּחִי יְרוּשָֽֽֽׁלַיִם אֶת-יְהוָֹה	הַלְלִי אֱלֹֽֽֽהַיִךְ צִיּוֹן:	ּכִּי-חִזַּק בְּרִיחֵי שְׁעָֽֽֽרָיִךְ	בֵּרַךְ בָּֽֽֽנַיִךְ בְּקִרְבֵּךְ:	ּהַשָּׂם-גְּבוּלֵךְ שָׁלוֹם	ֽֽֽחֵלֶב חִטִּים יַשְׂבִּיעֵךְ:	ּהַשֹּֽֽֽׁלֵחַ אִמְרָתוֹ ֽֽֽאָרֶץ	עַד-מְהֵרָה יָרוּץ דְּבָרוֹ:	ּהַנֹּתֵן ֽֽֽשֶׁלֶג כַּֽֽֽצָּמֶר	כְּפוֹר כָּֽֽֽאֵפֶר יְפַזֵּר:	ּמַשְׁלִיךְ קַרְחוֹ כְפִתִּים	לִפְנֵי קָרָתוֹ מִי יַעֲמֹד:	ּיִשְׁלַח דְּבָרוֹ וְיַמְסֵם	יַשֵּׁב רוּחוֹ יִזְּלוּ-ֽֽֽמָיִם:	ּ*מַגִּיד דְּבָרָיו לְיַעֲקֹב	חֻקָּיו וּמִשְׁפָּטָיו לְיִשְׂרָאֵל:	ּלֹא ֽֽֽעָשָׂה כֵן לְכָל-גּוֹי	וּמִשְׁפָּטִים בַּל-יְדָעוּם/HN
