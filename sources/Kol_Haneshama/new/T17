/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. /ITBareh/±u/XX calls the congregation together for formal worship.
The sections that precede it in the morning service, /ITBirh/±ot Hashah/±ar/XX and
/ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX, have brought individuals gradually closer together until
they could reach the mutual connection needed for joining together in
prayer. The emotional stirring and heightened awareness brought by these
earlier sections now become focused in the tighter intellectual structure of
the Shema and its blessings and the /ITAmidah/XX.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The first major theme following /ITBareh/±u/XX is that of Creation.
We wonder at the order, the complexity, the vastness of our world. Struck
by our own smallness, we are nonetheless also caught up in the grace of
having a home amidst the splendor that is nature. Our wonder and our
sense of smallness give way to thankfulness for the gift of life in this
world.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

their theological outlooks and ethical concerns. At any place where a bless-

Let all beings acknowledge you, all cry praise to you, and all
declare: There is none as holy as /SCT/XXHE /XXO/XXNE/XX! Let all beings hold
you in the highest reverence, you, the fashioner of all. The God
who opens up each day the doors and gateways of the East, who
bursts open the windows of the heavensò dome, bringing forth
the sunlight from its place and moonlight from its seat of rest,
providing light for the entire world and for its creatures--all of
whom divinity, in boundless love, brought into being. Bringer
of light, with tender care, upon the earth and its inhabitants, in
goodness you renew each day perpetually Creationòs wondrous
work./PI/PR

/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. God appears here as "cosmic housekeeper" pulling up the
windowshades, opening the doors to the morning light, revealing creative
possibilities within each day. When we bring a sense of the holy to even
the most mundane tasks, we become able to share consciously in the end-
less perpetual renewal of Creationòs wondrous work. May we remain open
to the creative sparks we find in those we encounter, in the world around
us, and within ourselves.    /SC/XXR.S./XX/PR

/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. A sense of Godòs excesses seems to characterize this out-
burst of hymns in praise of the creator of the cosmic lights. The verses
seem also to reflect a sense of divine energy overflowing through the
world, filling the Universe with limitless luminosity. To proclaim this
plenitude is a special human privilege, made possible for many of us by
these radiant words of prayer.    /SC/XXE.G./XX/PR

image of a God who opens the doorway of the East and bursts through
the heavenly windows so that light might shine into our world is one of
our traditionòs most powerful. Since ancient times, light has been a meta-
phor for divinity. Light is the most subtle of substances. It bathes us in its
glow and nourishes our existence in ways we can hardly articulate. God is
the light-source toward which we humans stretch in constant reach. We
are sustained by Godòs light.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

רב   םו ב  / you renew each day perpetually Creationòs
wondrous work. Rabbi Bunam taught, "The Holy One created the world
in a state of beginning. The universe is always in an uncompleted state, in
the form of its beginning. It is not like a vessel at which the master works
until it is finished; it requires continuous labor and unceasing renewal by
creative forces. Were there a secondòs pause by these forces, the universe
would return to primeval chaos."    /SC/XXH/±ASIDIC/XX/PR

However, "the future world" can refer to the world that we are moving
toward as a result of increasing scientific knowledge and technological
sophistication. We affirm that the divine unity that underlies all of Cre-
ation is the basis upon which all our increasing knowledge rests. This sec-
tion of the service, which celebrates creation, is an affirmation of the
divine unity that underlies it. From our perspective any future world
should still pay homage to that divine unity.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This is an ancient hymn originally used in the Rosh Hasha-
nah morning service. It may be sung to any of several tunes used for /ITAdon
Olam/XX or /ITEl Adon/XX. This simple list of attributes for "the life of all the
worlds" harks back to the most primitive forms of religious poetry. Fol-
lowing a double acrostic pattern--here repeated in the English
translation--the author calls forth the qualities we associate with God./PR

/PR

"Do you want to know the One we worship?" the poet seems to say.
"Then know all these qualities, for it is in them that God, `the life of all
the worldsò, may be said to dwell." The poem may thus be seen as an early
expression of predicate theology, a way of approaching a definition of God
by listing the qualities we associate with divinity.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR
