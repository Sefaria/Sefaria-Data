/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. A. J. Heschel has said, "The term, `God of Abraham, Isaac,
and JacobÚ is semantically different from a term such as `the God of truth,
goodness, and beauty.Ú Abraham, Isaac and Jacob do not signify ideas, prin-
ciples or abstract values. Nor do they stand for teachers or thinkers, and
the term is not to be understood like that of `the God of Kant, Hegel, and
Schelling.Ú Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not principles to be compre-
hended but lives to be continued. The life of one who joins the covenant
of Abraham continues the life of Abraham. For the present is not apart
from the past. `Abraham is still standing before GodÚ (Genesis 18:22).
Abraham endures forever. We are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." In this same
spirit, we are also Sarah and Rebekah, Rachel and Leah.    /SC/XXL.W.K./XX/PR

/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. The introductory words (Psalm 51:17) of the /ITAmidah/XX contain
a paradox of divine and human power. Our ability to be whole, upright,
free, and fully alive grows as we acknowledge and appreciate an infinitely
higher source of power in the universe. This allows us to be receptive. By
acknowledging our human vulnerability, we open our hearts to the sup-
port, compassion, and faithfulness available around us.    /SC/XXS.P.W./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. /ITHatefilah/XX / The Prayer, is the central prayer of the worship
service. The language and manner of reciting the /ITTefilah/XX offer insights into
the place of the individual in communal prayer. When the /ITTefilah/XX is recited
privately, each individual stands (hence the name /ITAmidah/XX, "standing") and
addresses God in a sustained conversational way. Calling God "you" indi-
cates intimacy and immediacy. Nevertheless, the individual prays with the
communal voice: "We acknowledge you," "Bless us," "Grant us peace."
The Mishnah provides the structure within which additional prayers and
petitions are placed. Even an individualÚs private needs have importance
within the communal context./PR
Throughout the centuries the pursuit of meaningful communal prayer has
led to variations in the /ITAmidah/XX. These variations reflect the attitudes and
beliefs of different prayer communities. In the ongoing pursuit of mean-
ingful prayer for a Reconstructionist prayer community, changes have been
introduced into this /ITAmidah/XX, most notably in the first two of the seven
/ITberah/±ot/XX which comprise the Shabbat /ITAmidah/XX. The first /ITberah/±ah/XX has been
expanded to include the matriarchs along with the patriarchs as exemplars
of GodÚs presence in human lives. By concentrating on examples of heal-
ing forces and life-sustaining rains, the second /ITberah/±ah/XX acknowledges God
as the power that sustains life. The traditional emphasis on GodÚs ability
to resurrect the dead has been replaced here by a celebration of God as the
power that sustains all life.    /SC/XXS.S./PR

Ñòô öòÜí / /ITezrat sarah/XX. The biblical term /ITezer/XX has two meanings, "rescue"
and "be strong." It is commonly translated as "aid" or "help". It also has
the sense of power and strength. In Deuteronomy 33:29, /ITezer/XX is parallel to
ÑÖÄÇ, majesty. Eve is described as AdamÚs /ITezer kenegdo/XX, a power equal to him,
a strength and majesty to match his. Thus /ITmagen avraham/XX (shield of Abra-
ham) and /ITezrat sarah/XX (help of Sarah) are parallel images of power and
protection.    /SC/XXR.S.A./XX/PR

çöåîö ÅÑåÖ. The external mouthing of words alone cannot move us. It is
the inward flame of devotion that brings our prayer close to God. Indeed,
as the Hebrew phrasing vividly conveys, a passionate longing for godliness
can exist among those unable to express that feeling in words. The phrase
/ITlahav tefilatam/XX, "the flame of IsraelÚs prayer," recalls that feeling of
/IThitlahavut/XX: the "in-burning" flame of passionate devotion. To attain
/IThitlahavut/XX in prayer is to soar with the rapturous ecstasy of divine commu-
nion, to access the infinite and be aflame with the nearness of God./PR

is a need for daily wonder, there is a need for daily worship. The sense of
the "miracles which are daily with us," the sense of the "continual mar-
