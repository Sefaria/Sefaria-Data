The sections that precede it in the morning service, /ITBirh/±ot Hashah/±ar/XX and
/ITPesukey Dezimrah/XX, have brought individuals gradually closer together until
they could reach the mutual connection needed for joining together in
prayer. The emotional stirring and heightened awareness brought by these
earlier sections now become focused in the tighter intellectual structure of
the Shema and its blessings and the /ITAmidah/XX.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

by our own smallness, we are nonetheless also caught up in the grace of
having a home amidst the splendor that is nature. Our wonder and our
sense of smallness give way to thankfulness for the gift of life in this

their theological outlooks and ethical concerns. At any place where a bless-

declare: There is none as holy as /SCT/XXHE /XXO/XXNE/XX! Let all beings hold
you in the highest reverence, you, the fashioner of all. The God

bursts open the windows of the heavensÚ dome, bringing forth
the sunlight from its place and moonlight from its seat of rest,
providing light for the entire world and for its creatures--all of

windowshades, opening the doors to the morning light, revealing creative
possibilities within each day. When we bring a sense of the holy to even

less perpetual renewal of CreationÚs wondrous work. May we remain open
to the creative sparks we find in those we encounter, in the world around

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This is an ancient hymn originally used in the Rosh Hasha-
nah morning service. It may be sung to any of several tunes used for /ITAdon
Olam/XX or /ITEl Adon/XX. This simple list of attributes for "the life of all the
worlds" harks back to the most primitive forms of religious poetry. Fol-
lowing a double acrostic pattern--here repeated in the English
translation--the author calls forth the qualities we associate with God./PR
/PR
"Do you want to know the One we worship?" the poet seems to say.
"Then know all these qualities, for it is in them that God, `the life of all
the worldsÚ, may be said to dwell." The poem may thus be seen as an early
expression of predicate theology, a way of approaching a definition of God
by listing the qualities we associate with divinity.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. This hymn, which, like the preceding one, is a classic text
of Merkavah mysticism, seems to depict the choruses of praise sung by the
angels to God. Like its predecessor, the song is an alphabetical acrostic; in
the translation, the initial letter or sound of each line corresponds to a
letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and is also echoed later in the line.    /SC/XXJ.R./XX/PR
