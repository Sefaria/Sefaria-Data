vidual times of joy and need. When /ITbirkat hagomel/XX or a /ITmisheberah/±/XX is
recited, it is customary to contribute to /ITtzedakah/XX. Often this offering is
directed to the synagogue. On happy occasions this serves as an offering
of thanksgiving. A /ITmisheberah/±/XX in the form of petition, such as a prayer for
healing, was traditionally offered in the hope that a good deed would
encourage divine intervention. More recently the act of /ITtzedakah/XX has been
understood as a tangible way of expressing gratitude for the support and
good wishes of the community. Just as the community supports the indi-
vidual in times of need, so does the community depend upon the support
of each individual.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. Most liturgists agree that the practice of reciting a /ITHaftarah/XX,
generally a selection from the prophets, probably developed during a time
when public reading of the Torah was banned. A selection roughly paral-
leling a major theme from the weekÚs Torah portion was therefore
selected. When public reading of the Torah became possible again, the
popular custom of chanting the /ITHaftarah/XX continued. The /ITHaftarah/XX is
usually chanted, utilizing a /ITtrop/XX or cantillation system that has numerous
variations. In modern times the bar / bat mitzvah has often taken
on this responsibility as a sign of committed membership in the adult
community.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR

Öêâáéô / Give us joy. The traditional /ITHaftarah/XX blessing contains references
to the reestablishment of the rule of the Davidic dynasty. This understand-
ing of a messianic reappearance of hereditary kingship has been rejected
by Reconstructionist thought on both moral and theological grounds.
Nonetheless the messianic hope for a world redeemed remains in our
thoughts as the ultimate achievement towards which humanity should
strive./PR
The version of the /ITHaftarah/XX blessing included here eliminates the Davidic
references and the hopes for a literal messiah that they invoke. In their
place are Malachi 3:24 and a slightly altered version of Isaiah 56:7. The
vision in Malachi, which is the /ITHaftarah/XX for Shabbat Hagadol, sees Elijah
coming to herald messianic days, turning the hearts of parents and chil-
dren toward each other. The task of redemption can be completed when
all of us open our hearts to our families, to our communities, and to all
the inhabitants of our world. Then our world will truly have become a
house of prayer for all peoples, bringing the peace for which we all
hope.    /SC/XXD.A.T./XX/PR
