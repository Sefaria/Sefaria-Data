/SCK/XXAVANAH/XX. Public worship aids us by liberating personality from the con-
fining walls of the individual ego. Imprisoned in self, we easily fall prey
to morbid brooding. Interference with career, personal disappointment and
disillusionment, hurts to vanity, the fear of death--all these tend so to
dominate our attention that our minds move in a fixed and narrow system
of ideas, which we detest but from which we see no escape. With a whole
wide world of boundless opportunities about us, we permit our minds, as
it were, to pace up and down within the narrow cell of their ego-prisons.
But participation in public worship breaks through the prison of the ego
and lets in the light and air of the world. Instead of living but one small
and petty life, we now share the multitudinous life of our people. Against
the wider horizons that now open to our ken, personal cares do not loom
so large. Life becomes infinitely more meaningful and worthwhile when
we become aware, through our participation in public worship, of a com-
mon life that transcends our individual selves.    /SC/XXM.M.K. (ADAPTED)/PR

so with all our strength, so that we will have no strength left to say, "are
you." And this is the meaning of the verse in the Scriptures: "But they
that wait for God shall exchange their strength." What we are really say-
ing is: "Source of life, I am giving you all the strength that is within me
in that very first word; now will you, in exchange, give me an abundance
of new strength, so that I can go on with my prayer."    /SC/XXM.B. (ADAPTED)/XX/PR

çâÅòí Åâòíé ÖòÅÉÅ òôÄ / by whose word the evenings fall. The word plays
a central role in the Jewish imagination. Our liturgy fantasizes that God
brings on evening each night by saying "Evening!" Thus we repeat each
day the original act of Creation that took place by means of the divine
word. It is only because we affirm a God who so values language that we
feel ourselves able to use words in prayer. Our word, perhaps like GodÚs,
gives expression to a depth that goes beyond language, but that can be
shared only though the symbolic power of speech.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The two /ITberah/±ot/XX which precede the Shema set the stage for
its evening recitation. The first /ITberah/±ah/XX praises God for the wonders of
creation that are visible at twilight: the shifting pattern of the stars, the
rhythm of the seasons, the regular passage from day to night. All of these
are a nightly reminder of the unchanging plan of creation./PR
/PR
The second /ITberah/±ah/XX praises God, whose instruction is a special token of
love for Israel. Israel responds by meditating upon GodÚs teaching "day
and night," "when we lie down and when we rise." This phrasing recalls
the preceding /ITberah/±ah/XX, adding IsraelÚs study of Torah to the natural order:
The sun sets, the stars shine, and Israel studies--as regularly as day and
night. The phrase "when we lie down and when we rise" anticipates the
Shema, which follows. This interplay between the /ITberah/±ot/XX and the Shema
suggests that the Shema is IsraelÚs morning and evening Torah study. At
the same time, it is IsraelÚs declaration of the oneness of the power that
makes for the natural order and for learning, for creation and human
creativity.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

Praised are you, God, ruler of the universe, who has ordained
the rhythm of life. The day with its light calls to activity and
exertion. But when the day wanes, when, with the setting of
the sun, colors fade, we cease from our labors and welcome the
tranquility of the night. The subdued light of the moon and
stars, the darkness and the stillness about us invite rest and
repose. Trustfully we yield to the quiet of sleep, for we know
that, while we are unaware of what goes on within and around
us, our powers of body and mind are renewed. Therefore, at this
evening hour, we seek composure of spirit. We give thanks for
the day and its tasks and for the night and its rest. Praised are
you, God, who brings on the evening./PR

/SCC/XXOMMENTARY/XX. The traditional wording of Biblical Selection II presents
detailed bountiful or devastating consequences of IsraelÚs collective rela-
tionship to the mitzvot. This biblical section (Deuteronomy 11:13-21)
offers a supernatural theology that many contemporary Jews find difficult.
The biblical section on this page (Deuteronomy 28:1-6, 30:15-19) was
included in the 1945 Reconstructionist Siddur. It begins by encouraging
observance in the same language, but concentrates on the positive ways in
which observance of mitzvot focuses our attention on GodÚs presence as
perceived through productivity and the pursuit of abundant life.    /SC/XXS.S./XX/PR

/SCD/XXERASH/XX. The traditional second paragraph of the Shema (Deuteronomy
11:13-21) offers an account of the natural process by which the blessings
of God themselves lead to pride, self-satisfaction, and ingratitude on the
part of those who receive them. Ironically, the more we are blessed, so it
seems, the less grateful and aware of blessing we become. It is when we
are most sated, Scripture warns us, that we should be most careful. Fullness
can lead to ingratitude, and ingratitude to idolatry--primarily in the form
of worship of our own accomplishments. Then, indeed, "the heavens
might close up and no rain fall." For, once we begin to worship our
achievements, we will never find satisfaction.    /SC/XXA.G./XX/PR

study GodÚs teachings (first paragraph) with the lesson that their fulfill-
