In Shir Hashirim 3:11 he is called King Shlomo, in Mishlei 1:1 he is called “King of Yisroel,” and here he is called “King in Yerusholayim.” The Gemara in Maseches Sanhedrin 20b, comments that his kingdom was diminished by the virtue of sin. He was first recognized universally as King Shlomo, after his sin he was King of Yisroel only, and then King of Yerusholayim alone. Alternatively, Sefer Koheles is replete with wisdom, therefore it states that its author reigned in “the city of wisdom,” thus he was exposed to much wisdom and his conclusions are worthy of great regard.@ms

<$1 10>10<TS>Alternatively, it would be better for a person to actually see where the soul of the righteous goes and where the soul of the wicked goes after their death. He would realize the difference and mend his ways. (Metsudas Dovid) @ms <$1 11>11<TS>According to the Midrash, this refers to Adam.

<$1 12>12<TS>Alternatively, “that he may do them [@hh<HEB>ויעשם@ee<ENG>] like a shadow,” i.e., while alive, a person should never rest, just as a shadow moves constantly as a result of the sun’s angle, so should a person constantly be on the move and be performing these good deeds constantly.

@fn<CH7><$1 1>1<TS>The Mishnah in Avos 4:13 states that there are three crowns, the crown of Torah, the crown of Kehunah and the crown of royalty, but the crown of a good name [@hh<HEB>כתר שם טוב@ee<ENG>], i.e., fine reputation, surpasses them all.@ms

<$1 6>6<TS>Alternatively, a fine reputation is better on the day of death than on the day of birth, because so long as one lives, his reputation is subject to possible future deterioration, whereas on the day of death there are no uncertainties. This thought is found in the Mishnah in Avos 2:4 wherein Hillel said, “do not believe in yourself until the day you die.” (Sforno) Or, it is good for one to consider his death [@hh<HEB>יום המות@ee<ENG>], beginning from the time that he is born [@hh<HEB>יום הולדו@ee<ENG>], and by doing so he will refrain from sinning. (Khilos Yaakov)@ms <$1 7>7<TS>Upon going to a house of mourning a person realizes that he too will be mourned when his time comes. This will cause him to be humbled and make him aware of sin. (Metsudas Dovid) Alternatively, the kindness done for the dead is absolute and the level of kindness [@hh<HEB>חסד של אמת@ee<ENG>], for the provider does anticipate any payback because that is “the end of all men.” However, when going to a house of feasting, e.g., a wedding, the newly married couple “take to heart” to remember that act of kindness so that they can return the kindness. The latter type of kindness is somewhat inferior to the former, and therefore Koheles says, “it is better to go to a house of mourning than to a house of feasting, etc. (Binah La’itim)@ms <$1 8>8<TS>Frequenting the company of those who pursue honor and vanity arouses one’s lust and desire for those things, and that is the intent of this verse. (Mesilas Yeshorim)@ms
<$1 9>9<TS>Alternatively, if a person who is planning to do evil visits a house of mourning, he will surely “take it to heart” the matters dealing with death, and will thus abandon his plans and repent before God. (Targum)@ms <$1 10>10<TS>Alterna_ tively, “better vexation stemming from levity,” i.e., when a situation calls for vexation [e.g., a teacher with his student], it should be only an appearance on the outside of anger, but not an emotional, true feeling, of anger.

<$1 11>11<TS>See Maseches Shabbos 30b.@ms <$1 12>12<TS>Alternatively, as a result of the drought and retribution inflicted upon the world, the righteous will pray to God for mercy. (Targum)@ms <$1 13>13<TS>The literal translation is somewhat difficult because the heart of the wise is located in the same place as everyone else, therefore Rashi explains that it refers to their thoughts. (Sifsei Chachomim)@ms <$1 14>14<TS>These are their thoughts even when they are not visiting a house of mourning. As a result they subordinate their desires and avoid sin. (Metsudas Dovid)@ms <$1 15>15<TS>Alternatively, the heart of the wise mourns over the destruction of the Beis Hamikdosh and grieve over Yisroel’s exile. (Targum)@ms <$1 16>16<TS>They are always thinking about joy and levity which brings a person to sin. (Metsudas Dovid)@ms <$1 17>17<TS>Alternatively, the heart of fools is involved in mockery, in eating, drinking and seeking enjoyment, and they have no concern over the suffering of their brethren. (Targum)@ms
<$1 18>18<TS>The crackling of thorns in the fire lasts only a brief moment and then is gone. So, too, the laughter of the fool has no useful purpose or lasting value. Or, the verse conveys the thought that the wise grieve because they are fearful that they are lacking in their service to God, whereas fools are generally satisfied and happy because they feel they have totally fulfilled their obligation in their service to God.@ms
<$1 19>19<TS>Shemos 5:21.@ms <$1 20>20<TS>A wise person should distance himself from being involved in discussion with fools because it will cause his own wisdom to suffer.

He who discerns what is about to come to pass.” (Ksav Sofer)@ms <$1 27>27<TS>Rashi should not be translated literally, that Rabbi Meir expounded this matter etc., rather Rabbi Meir was in the midst of expounding when Elisha clarified to Rabbi Meir what Rabbi Akiva expounded pertaining to this verse. (Sifsei Chachomim)@ms <$1 28>28<TS>See Mishnayos Avos 5:11.@ms
<$1 29>29<TS>Alternatively, the answer to this question is beyond human comprehension. (Metsudas Dovid)@ms <$1 30>30<TS>Alterna_ tively, @hh<HEB>נחלה@ee<ENG> refers to a monetary inheritance or a skill that is handed down from father to son (Ibn Ezra). Thereby, one is able to immerse himself in his studies without having the burden of financial worries (Alshich). See Mishnayos Avos 2:2 which states that the study of Torah is good when combined with an occupation, for the exertion of them both makes sin forgotten. Or, wisdom is good as an accompaniment to an inheritance, for without wisdom, the wealth he came into will not endure. (Metsudas Dovid)@ms <$1 31>31<TS>Mishnayos Nedarim 3:7.@ms
<$1 32>32<TS>Alternatively, just as wisdom of the Torah gives life [i.e., shelters] in the World of Come, so does money that is given to charity provide life [i.e., shelters] in the World to Come. (Targum)@ms <$1 33>33<TS>Wisdom is not subject to death or consumption. The idea that “wisdom preserves the life of him who possesses it,” may be in reference to the Gemara in Maseches Yevamos 97a, which states that the lips of a deceased scholar in whose name a traditional statement is reported in this world, move gently in the grave. (Reb Tzvi Charif)@ms <$1 34>34<TS>Alternatively, only God can straighten what He made crooked on account of the inequity of the generation, e.g., the Gemara in Maseches Rosh Hashanah 17b states, that if little rain had been decreed on account of the inequities of the generation and afterwards the people improved their ways, God will rectify what He made crooked and cause the rain to fall in its proper time and place without the loss of a drop. (Metsudas Dovid)@ms
<$1 35>35<TS>Alternatively, on a day of good fortune be happy and enjoy it. (Metsudas Dovid)@ms <$1 36>36<TS>Adversity is caused by being sinful. Therefore, examine your deeds and remove any sins by repenting (Sforno). Alternatively, on a day of adversity, reflect and be hopeful for a day of goodness to come. (Likutei Yehudah)@ms <$1 37>37<TS>Yeshayahu 66:24.@ms <$1 38>38<TS>Ibid.@ms <$1 39>39<TS>Alternatively, “one set up against the other,” refers to the punishment that was set up against the evil deeds, i.e., the concept of @hh<HEB>מדה כנגד מדה@ee<ENG>, that is, the manner of punishment corresponds to the sin, and it is never meted out in a greater amount than warranted.@ms
<$1 40>40<TS>Alternatively, “there is a righteous man who perishes because of his righteousness,” i.e., were he not righteous, he might not have been punished at all. God is more demanding with the righteous, as stated in Maseches Yevamos 121b (Metsudas Dovid and Alshich). Avrohom, Yaakov, Yoseif, Dovid, Michal and Chizkiyah are examples of righteous people who did not escape judgement because of a slight indiscretion on their part. (Mesilas Yeshorim)@ms <$1 41>41<TS>This Rashi refers back to the preceding one and explains the misdirected logic which led Shaul to spare Amoleik.@ms <$1 42>42<TS>I Divrei Hayomim 10:13.@ms <$1 43>43<TS>See I Shmuel 22:16±19.@ms <$1 44>44<TS>See I Shmuel 15:8±15.@ms
<$1 45>45<TS>Above, verse 17.@ms <$1 46>46<TS>Rashi explains the juxtaposition of verse 17 with this verse is to teach that in the event a person sinned slightly, his wisdom will encourage him to repent his way.

<$1 50>50<TS>Rashi is explaining the previous verse [Above 7:19], where one could question that instead of stating that wisdom encourages a person to repent, would not wisdom deter one from sinning altogether.
