<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat B’reshit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,1. </span><span class="font5">:</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בראשית. </span><span class="font5">The reason why G’d commenced the Torah with the letter ב, the second letter in the alphabet, instead of&nbsp;with letter א the first letter in the alphabet, is to draw our&nbsp;attention to the fact that the letter ב is surrounded from three&nbsp;sides, i.e. from east, west, and south, whereas the fourth&nbsp;side is left open, a warning that evil winds may blow from the&nbsp;north unimpeded by a barrier. We have a tradition dating&nbsp;back to Jeremiah, that disaster threatening the Jewish&nbsp;people has a habit of commencing from the North (Jeremiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1.14) . [This editor always found this puzzling as the meaning&nbsp;of the word צפון, “north,” is “hidden,” i.e. not easy of access,&nbsp;and here the letter ב being </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">open </span><span class="font5">in a northerly directions&nbsp;would appear to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">invite</span><span class="font5"> disaster. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We also find that the name of G’d when spelled א-דני appears in the Torah 134 times, corresponding to the&nbsp;combination of the first and last letter of each of the letters in&nbsp;the words for “east,” i.e. 48 מזרח, “south,” דרום, i.e. 44, and&nbsp;“west,” i.e. מערב, i.e. 42. The “north” is not hinted at, and is&nbsp;left open until there is a need, i.e. to counter it with a different&nbsp;name of the Lord. The number 134 is equivalent to the&nbsp;numerical value of the word (Aramaic) קלד, “to lock up, insert&nbsp;a key.” When disaster faces the Jewish people, G’d’s people,&nbsp;the Creator will be called upon to seal the fourth side of this&nbsp;first letter in the Torah by using His “name” as the key. The&nbsp;answer to the question, why He had left it open in the first&nbsp;place, seeing He sealed all the other directions to prevent&nbsp;attacks upon His people, is in order to present a challenge to&nbsp;the blasphemers when the time of the redemption comes to&nbsp;close this side if they are able to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you will count each letter of the alphabet and add it up according to their values as numbers, i.e. 2= ב+ 1=א plus ג =&nbsp;3, you will get a total of 1500, i.e. 500 for each of the three&nbsp;other directions, corresponding to the number 500, the years&nbsp;of travel on foot travel on foot required to cross the surface of&nbsp;the globe in each direction. (based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shir hashirim rabbah</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">6.14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">בראשית; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this word as follows: “Rabbi Yitzchok said that there was not really any need to&nbsp;commence the Torah before the beginning of chapter 12 in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Exodus, when G’d addressed the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jewish </span><span class="font5">nation with legislation about the forthcoming Passover. He only did so in&nbsp;order to tell mankind that He owns the earth and therefore&nbsp;can allocate parts of it to those, whom He chooses, i.e. that&nbsp;the Israelites did not rob the Canaanites of their land, which&nbsp;had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span><span class="font5"> been rightfully theirs. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> therefore considers&nbsp;the laws about Passover as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">first </span><span class="font5">commandment given to&nbsp;the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If we were to counter that the seven universal laws that apply to all of mankind apply to us also, and these had been&nbsp;given many years before there was an Avraham, even, the&nbsp;answer is that what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> meant was the Passover&nbsp;legislation was the first commandment given to the Jewish&nbsp;people when all of them were present during that address.&nbsp;(Exodus 12,3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the question that the mere idea of the Canaanites arguing that the Israelites had stolen their land, seeing that&nbsp;what belongs to the slave automatically belongs to his&nbsp;master, and Canaan (Noach’s grandson) had been demoted&nbsp;to being a slave by his grandfather ever since he had been&nbsp;cursed, so how could they have ever owned it? (compare&nbsp;Genesis 9,26) Canaan’s descendants had been slaves of&nbsp;Shem, the great-grandfather of Avraham ever since! </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">himself pointed this out already on Genesis 12,6. The&nbsp;Canaanites, as alluded to in that verse, had robbed the&nbsp;descendants of Shem of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">their</span><span class="font5"> heritage! We would have to&nbsp;answer that the Canaanites i.e. the tribes making up that&nbsp;kingdom, also contained kings (King of Chatzor) and others&nbsp;who were not descended from the original Canaan.&nbsp;(Compare Joshua, beginning chapter 11) The latter might&nbsp;even have been descended from Shem, so that the Israelites&nbsp;would have had a legal </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">claim</span><span class="font5"> on the land they occupied as&nbsp;they were rightful owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate way of explaining why the Torah commenced with the word (and the story that follows) of&nbsp;בראשית is this. It is to inform us of the sequence in which this&nbsp;material universe came into existence and how once created&nbsp;it was allocated to the creatures inhabiting it, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explained, i.e. to prove that the Canaanites had no legal&nbsp;claim to dispute the Jews’ viewing it as their inheritance,&nbsp;ancestral heritage, by claiming that rightfully Eylam had a&nbsp;legal claim to it. [Eylam was Shem’s firstborn son, (Genesis&nbsp;10,21, whereas Avraham was a descendant of Shem’s&nbsp;youngest son Arpachshad, basing themselves on what is&nbsp;written in Genesis 11,13 where this son is listed last, not first&nbsp;as in 10,21. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet another reason for the Torah commencing with the words: בראשית ברא אלוקים, “at the beginning G’d created, etc.;”&nbsp;is to state categorically that the universe in which we live did&nbsp;not exist eternally, or is the result of “the big bang,” but was&nbsp;created by a Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> states that G’d allocated the land of Israel to the Israelites מרצונו, “as an expression of His goodwill,” this&nbsp;is an implied warning that such an allocation was not&nbsp;absolute and irreversible for all future time, otherwise how&nbsp;could He take it back by exiling its people and reallocate it to&nbsp;someone else? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> also makes the point that the word&nbsp;ראשית, whenever it occurs in the Bible is invariably linked to&nbsp;the word following it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The author, supporting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> cites an example from Leviticus 2,12: קרבן ראשית תקריבו אותם, “you are to present&nbsp;them as an initial offering.” [Rabbi Chavell, in his annotations,&nbsp;already pointed out that the author’s statement is not quite&nbsp;accurate, pointing to Deuteronomy 33,21, וירא ראשית לו. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בראשית ברא</span><span class="font5">, “first of all, before any creatures were created,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G’d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;created heaven and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth;”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our author</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">compares this to Jeremiah writing in Jeremiah 26,1: בראשית ממלכות יהויקים בן יאשיהו, “at the beginning of the rule of&nbsp;Yehoyakim, son of Yoshiyahu, etc.” The author mentions that&nbsp;Onkelos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;translates these two&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as: “at the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">beginning He created.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'אלוקים וגו, if there is a person [Jewish believer, of course] who is baffled by the plural ending in the word for G’d&nbsp;in the Holy Tongue, (i.e. אלוקים, אלוקינו, אלוקי) thinking that&nbsp;this is utterly inappropriate in a Book teaching monotheism&nbsp;such as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Torah, such a person&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflect for a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">moment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider that references to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divinity and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">addressed to the individual are generally phrased as the Divinity mentioned being in the plural mode. [as is the&nbsp;custom for earthly kings, who speak of themselves in the&nbsp;plural mode, something known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pluralis majestatis.</span><span class="font5"> It&nbsp;would border on blasphemy if the Torah would accord G’d </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">lesser title than the one arrogated to themselves by earthly rulers. Ed.]. Examples quoted by the author are: Exodus&nbsp;3,16-</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אלוקי</span><span class="font5"> אברהם יצחק ויעקב, or Genesis 42,7: דבר האיש </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אדוני</span><span class="font5">&nbsp;הארץ or Exodus 22,14: אם </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">בעליו</span><span class="font5"> עמו; there are many more&nbsp;examples of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do not answer me by saying that the vocalization of the word א-ד-נ-י when written with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz</span><span class="font5"> is sacred, whereas&nbsp;when not it is profane. Are you going to argue the same for&nbsp;the roots: בנאי ,זכאי ,שדי (fool) אשמאי and others, [that when&nbsp;using the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz</span><span class="font5"> they are transformed into sacred&nbsp;words? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The truth is that that the Divine name for G’d is also used in the plural mode, and no one as a result disputes that&nbsp;He is unique and solitary! The deeper meaning of the word&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elo-him</span><span class="font5"> is “majesty, authority.” When G’d proclaimed at the&nbsp;beginning of the Decalogue: אנכי “I” (singular) ה' אלוקיך, “am&nbsp;the Lord your G’d(s)” (plural), i.e. the meaning is that&nbsp;whereas every other ruler or king rules over a certain&nbsp;narrowly defined domain, “I am the One Who rules over&nbsp;everything, the entire universe.” [Surely this justifies the use&nbsp;of the plural mode! Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only that, earthly rulers or kings, being mortal, have to worry about who will succeed them, and in the event that a&nbsp;king does not have a biological heir, or has otherwise&nbsp;become weak and unable to carry out his functions for the&nbsp;benefit of his subjects, he must be replaced. None of these&nbsp;problems, will ever face the G’d Who introduces Himself to&nbsp;His people at Mount Sinai at the beginning of the Decalogue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, from the subject’s point of view, if a subject feels oppressed by a particular king whose domain&nbsp;he inhabits, he has the option (unless he is in jail) to move to&nbsp;the domain of a different earthly king. Not so with G’d’s, the&nbsp;Creator’s, subjects. There is no place in the universe to&nbsp;which they can flee to escape His rule. On the other hand,&nbsp;the subjects of G’d enjoy the advantage that they never have&nbsp;to worry that the successor of a benign king such as He, will&nbsp;be autocratic and make the lives of his subjects miserable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את השמים, “the heavens;” </span><span class="font5">in an ancient version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash Tanchuma B’reshit,8,</span><span class="font5"> Rabbi Yishmael is quoted as&nbsp;having asked Rabbi Akiva: (who was preoccupied with&nbsp;counting every apparently unnecessary word את and גם in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Torah) ‘what is the significance of the two words את in this verse,’ i.e. what do these words contribute to our&nbsp;understanding of the line: “G’d had created the heavens and&nbsp;the earth?” Rabbi Akiva replied that if the Torah had merely&nbsp;written: בראשית ברא אלוקים שמים והארץ, people would have&nbsp;thought that the terms שמים and ארץ refer to two separate&nbsp;divinities each of whom had created part of the universe&nbsp;Phrasing it as it did, the Torah ensured that we could not&nbsp;have made such an error and that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font5"> had created both&nbsp;the heavenly and the earthly regions of the universe. [In&nbsp;other words, the word את before the words השמים and הארץ&nbsp;makes it clear that what follows are creatures, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">products</span><span class="font5"> of&nbsp;G’d’s creative activity. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">השמים</span><span class="font5">, the prefix ה is to tell us that “the” heavens, (and “the” earth,) are phenomena with which the reader is&nbsp;supposed to be familiar. The fact that the plural mode is used&nbsp;does not mean that there are many small units which&nbsp;combine to make a heaven or an earth, but the plural ending&nbsp;is similar to the plural ending in the words: ,מים, חיים, פנים&nbsp;מלקחים, מעיים, רחיים, water, life, face, tongs, entrails,&nbsp;millstones, and many more like it. Basically, the term שמים&nbsp;describes something above us, whereas the term ארץ&nbsp;describes something below us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1,2. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והארץ היתה תוהו</span><span class="font5">, “and the earth which we know nowadays as organized, and in an orderly condition,” was&nbsp;chaotic when G’d first created it;” it contained neither&nbsp;vegetation, living creatures nor creeping organisms but was&nbsp;in complete darkness, as according to the translation&nbsp;rendered by the Jerusalem Targum, “and the earth was&nbsp;devoid of human beings, totally empty of living beings, the&nbsp;reason being that it was completely covered by water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תוהו</span><span class="font5">, this word in a similar construction appears in Psalms 107,40: ויעתם בתוהו לא דרך, “and He makes them lose&nbsp;their way, in a trackless desert.” It also occurs in Jeremiah&nbsp;4,23: ראיתי את הארץ והנה תוהו, “I saw the earth, and here it is&nbsp;chaotic.” It would be incorrect to understand our verse as&nbsp;referring to the condition of the universe before heaven and&nbsp;earth had been created. If that translation were correct, the&nbsp;Torah should have written: והארץ היה תוהו ובוהו, i.e. “what is&nbsp;now viewed as “earth” already existed but in a chaotic state.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that the Torah wrote instead: היתה, is proof that that word refers to the earth itself, i.e. that at its inception the&nbsp;earth </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">had been </span><span class="font5">in a chaotic state</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the whole phrase refers to the future, i.e. before the Lord created heaven and earth, there&nbsp;was only chaos. The same would apply to the words&nbsp;following, i.e. על פני תהום, on the surface of what in the future&nbsp;would be known as the תהום, “the great depth.” An alternate&nbsp;way of saying this is: מרחפת על פני המים, “was hovering on the&nbsp;surface of the ocean.” (the darkness). We must remember&nbsp;that the phenomena described by the Torah had not yet been&nbsp;created at the “time” described by the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are a number of phenomena that had not yet been created, such as the angels, the heavenly regions for&nbsp;the righteous and the abyss for the wicked, known&nbsp;respectively as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">maasseh merkavah and gehinom.</span><span class="font5"> The&nbsp;Torah, in describing the creation, refers only to phenomena&nbsp;visible to the human being. Even the planting of the garden in&nbsp;Eden has been written about in the Torah only in order to&nbsp;explain to us how and why first man declined so precipitously&nbsp;morally shortly after having been created. Nonetheless, the&nbsp;text conveys that the garden of Eden was created (planted)&nbsp;at the same time as the heavens and the earth, and that is&nbsp;why the Torah wrote: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויכולו השמים והארץ וכל צבאם; </span><span class="font5">“heaven and&nbsp;earth, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">all their components had been completed.” (2,1)&nbsp;The Bible also writes: (Nechemyah 9,6) ,אתה עשית את השמים&nbsp;שמי השמי, וכל צבאם, הארץ וכל אשר עליה,הים ואת כל אשר בהם, “You&nbsp;have completed heaven in all its details, as well as the upper&nbsp;heaven and all their host, the earth and everything on it, the&nbsp;ocean and everything in them.” We also read in Exodus&nbsp;20,11 (part of the Decalogue): כי ששת ימים עשה ה' את השמים&nbsp;ואת הארץ, את הים ואת כל אשר בם, “for during a sequence of six&nbsp;days, the Lord completed the creation of heaven and earth,&nbsp;as well as the ocean and all their respective inhabitants;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no reason for you, the reader, to be amazed at the feminine mode, i.e. היתה, “she had been,” used by the&nbsp;Torah when describing phenomena which are masculine; we&nbsp;find more such examples in the Bible, one being in Judges&nbsp;18,7: ויראו את העם אשר בקרבה </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">יושבת</span><span class="font5"> לבטח, “they observed the&nbsp;people dwelling in it carefree, etc.” [We would have expected&nbsp;יושב instead of יושבת seeing that the subject עם is masculine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ed.] In Samuel 1,4,17 even the Holy Ark, which is always considered masculine, is referred to in the feminine mode,&nbsp;when the prophet wrote: וארון האלוקים נלקחה, “and the Ark of&nbsp;G’d was captured;” in Numbers 11,15, Moses is quoted as&nbsp;saying to G’d: ואם ככה את עושה לי “and if </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">You,</span><span class="font5"> feminine mode&nbsp;for G’d, are </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">doing</span><span class="font5"> (masculine mode) thus to me,” etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Incidentally, the prefix ו before the word: הארץ, appears to be unnecessary, as it does on numerous occasions, a&nbsp;glaring example being Exodus 13,7 ולא נחם אלוקים “(and) G’d&nbsp;did not guide them, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והארץ היתה תוהו ובוהו</span><span class="font5">; “and the earth had been in a chaotic state;” the Torah, out of respect for the heavenly&nbsp;regions, did not include “heaven” as having been in a chaotic&nbsp;state, seeing that it was the home of G’d’s Presence.&nbsp;According to the view expressed in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Chagigah</span><span class="font5"> 2)&nbsp;the meaning of the line is that also this “state of chaos” had&nbsp;been subject to creation. In order to visualise this, we must&nbsp;assume that G’d created this ”chaos” in a region surrounding&nbsp;the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחשך על פני תהום</span><span class="font5">, “and there was darkness on the face of the abyss;” the “abyss” is the term used for this region&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">surrounding </span><span class="font5">earth. The fact that G’d had created the initial&nbsp;stage of darkness is recited by us in our daily prayers when&nbsp;we recite the words: יוצר אור ובורא חשך, “Who fashioned light,&nbsp;whereas He only created darkness in its initial stage.” [The&nbsp;creative process is divided into three stages, each&nbsp;progressively more detailed, i.e. בריאה, יצירה, עשיה. When it&nbsp;came to the creation of human beings, G’d involved Himself&nbsp;personally right through the process of עשיה, completion. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to our author, there was a “time” previous to the existence of even light and darkness. Our sages in the&nbsp;Talmud taught us not to even try and understand what&nbsp;preceded the “time,” when G’d created light, nor the ”time”&nbsp;when this universe will have completed the function for which&nbsp;He had created it. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Chagigah</span><span class="font5"> 12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורוח אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “and the spirit of G’d, etc.” This expression too tries to describe for us something that exists </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">outside </span><span class="font5">the&nbsp;“universe” is abstract, similar to the expression תהום, in the&nbsp;first half of this verse. This “רוח” is also perceived as קדש,&nbsp;holy, [something apart, in this instance, not tangible, Ed.] and&nbsp;is described in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chagigah</span><span class="font5"> 12 as one of the 10&nbsp;phenomena that Gd created on the first “day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורוח </span><span class="font5">the prefix ו at the beginning of this word is meant to include the four winds which blow on earth in four directions&nbsp;every day at different levels of the atmosphere. According to&nbsp;our author (based on the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin,</span><span class="font5">31) the east wind&nbsp;blows daily in the morning until noon, its principal feature&nbsp;being that it is hot and moist. From noon until sunset, the&nbsp;south wind blows, its principal feature being that it is hot and&nbsp;dry. During the first half of the night a westerly wind blows, its&nbsp;principal feature being that it is cool and moist, whereas the&nbsp;north wind is apt to blow from midnight until sunrise, its&nbsp;principal feature is that it is cold and dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורוח אלקים</span><span class="font5">, this wind was needed as a feature on physical earth, at the time when G’d commanded the waters&nbsp;to recede so that dry land would become visible. (Genesis&nbsp;1,9). Compare also Exodus 1,21 when Moses credits the&nbsp;east wind with having made possible the splitting of the sea&nbsp;of reeds, enabling the people of Israel to cross on dry&nbsp;ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,3. ויאמר אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “G’d said:” seeing that there were no intelligent creatures as yet that G’d could have spoken to, the&nbsp;meaning of this statement must be that “G’d spoke to His&nbsp;heart, to the seat of His thoughts.” Even in our physical world&nbsp;nowadays when a human being expresses thoughts verbally,&nbsp;these are products of his thought processes which preceded&nbsp;his thoughts being formulated. If we needed proof for the&nbsp;correctness of this approach, the reader only needs to look at&nbsp;Genesis 6,6-7: וינחם ה' כי עשה את האדם בארץ ויתעצב אל לבו. ויאמר&nbsp;ה׳ אמחה את האדם אשר בראתי וגו', “The Lord became regretful&nbsp;that He had created man on the earth, and His heart was&nbsp;saddened; He said: “I will wipe out the human race on earth,&nbsp;etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יהי אור</span><span class="font5">, “let there be light!” Before the heavens had been stretched out over the firmament the light of G’d had&nbsp;permeated the entire universe in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">equal</span><span class="font5"> measure. Once He&nbsp;had stretched out the sky like a carpet, (Psalms 104,2) the&nbsp;heavens formed the barrier between the rest of the universe&nbsp;and the תהום, the deep abyss beyond. This is why the Torah&nbsp;had stated that the darkness had formed a cover over that&nbsp;abyss. (Verse 2) This is why its creation was preceded by a&nbsp;commandment, seeing that the light created now was&nbsp;something good for all the stages of creation that were to&nbsp;follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יהי אור</span><span class="font5">; three phenomena were created on the first “day;” heaven, earth and light. Each of these phenomena&nbsp;contributed its accessories at the appropriate time. The&nbsp;heaven produced its offspring, i.e. the horizon, רקיע, on the&nbsp;second “day,” and the earth, on the third “day,” produced&nbsp;simple vegetation, i.e. grass and trees. The “light” produced&nbsp;the luminaries and the stars on the fourth “day.” Proof that&nbsp;these developments were not “something from nothing,” as&nbsp;the first phase of the creation is that the Torah describes&nbsp;G’d’s commandment in each instance not with the word: “let&nbsp;there be,” יהי, but with the word “produce,” תוצא. This is&nbsp;similar to G’d’s command to Noach at the end of the deluge,&nbsp;when He said: צא מן התבה, “exit from the ark!” (Genesis 8,16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ויהי אור, and “light” had materalised. The reason why on subsequent occasions, the Torah merely writes: ויהי כן, “and&nbsp;so it came to be,” is for the sake of brevity. Our sages&nbsp;therefore have taught us in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> 3, that one should&nbsp;always strive to express one’s thoughts as concisely as&nbsp;possible, [while avoiding being misunderstood. Ed.] In this&nbsp;instance, by spelling out the word אור, the Torah did not add&nbsp;a single syllable beyond what was required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,4. וירא אלוקים את האור</span><span class="font5">, “G’d saw the light;” the meaning of the word: וירא in this verse is that He contemplated,&nbsp;understood the impact that this light had made. In other&nbsp;words, this was “seeing” with one’s heart; we find the verb&nbsp;ראה used in this sense also in Exodus 12,13, where G’d is&nbsp;described as “וראיתי את הדם,” “When I take note of the blood”&nbsp;(on the entrance of the homes of the Israelites”); we find it&nbsp;used again use in that sense in Exodus 33,12, as well as in&nbsp;Kohelet 2,17. Even though everything in the past present and&nbsp;the future is “visible” to the Lord, it is impossible to explain&nbsp;the word here in the usual sense of seeing with one’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבדל אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “G’d made a distinction;” this referred to the earliest point in time that was possible, i.e. on the fourth day,&nbsp;(1,18) after the luminaries had been created. We find a&nbsp;similar example of when the Torah reports something as the&nbsp;ultimate purpose before it could be carried out when the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Torah describes G’d as having created man as “male and female” ,1,28) ,זכר ונקבה ברא אותם) although the Torah had not&nbsp;yet told us that G’d took part of Adam’s body to create&nbsp;woman. (2,22) In both instances the Torah reveals G’d‘s&nbsp;ultimate purpose already when it reports G’d as having made&nbsp;the first step in that process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand the word ויבדל as telling us that G’d already named the result of what He did in&nbsp;advance by naming it “day” and “night,” respectively. (verse&nbsp;5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,5. ויקרא אלוקים לאור יום, </span><span class="font5">G’d named the light: “day;” G’d named a total of six phenomena that He created, as there&nbsp;was as yet no human being that could name these&nbsp;phenomena. [Compared to the time when He invited Adam to&nbsp;name the animals. Ed.] They are: ,אור, חשך, שמים, ארץ, ימים&nbsp;אדם, “light, darkness, heaven, earth, days and man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Elazar is quoted as saying that the Lord does not associate His name with anything that is evil, only with&nbsp;phenomena that are good, positive, and constructive.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit Rabbah 3)</span><span class="font5"> You will note that when referring to the&nbsp;light, the Torah associates G’d’s name with it by writing the&nbsp;sequence </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ויקרא אלוקים</span><span class="font5"> לאור יום, whereas when speaking of&nbsp;the darkness,.ולחשך קרא לילה, “and the darkness He called&nbsp;night.” G’d’s name was not repeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהי ערב ויהי בקר, “</span><span class="font5">there was evening, there was morning;” even though the darkness had existed since the first hour of&nbsp;the night, the Torah refers once more to the darkness, this&nbsp;time with the name לילה, “night.” The reason is that the Torah&nbsp;wished to stress that the creation of a day, i.e. a consecutive&nbsp;period of 24 hours was not two halves, but one whole. The&nbsp;same applies to the following “days” of creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יום אחד</span><span class="font5">, “one day.” According to the commentary of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the reason why this “day” is not described as “the first&nbsp;day,” as opposed to the subsequent “days” which have an&nbsp;ordinal number, i.e. “second,” “third,” etc;” this is to remind us&nbsp;that on that “day” the Holy One blessed be His name, was&nbsp;still unique, alone in the universe, there not being even&nbsp;angels in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation for the word אחד, instead of ראשון in this verse: It is grammatically not proper, to speak of “first,”&nbsp;i.e. the beginning of a numerical sequence while the next&nbsp;item in the sequence does not yet exist. Even when the first&nbsp;day had been completed, the second day had not even&nbsp;begun as yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יהי רקיע בתוך המים</span><span class="font5">, “let there be a horizon in the midst&nbsp;of the waters.” The heaven of which the Torah spoke as&nbsp;being part of G’d’s creative activity on the first “day,” had&nbsp;been an enclave within the waters which had covered the&nbsp;entire “universe” at that time. This paragraph therefore is&nbsp;closely associated with the previous one, i.e. to what had&nbsp;happened on the first “day.” The proof of this lies in the&nbsp;sentence that G’d had created heaven </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font5"> earth, which&nbsp;makes it clear that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> had been created on the first “day.&nbsp;(Compare Genesis 2,4, where the Torah refers specifically to&nbsp;the horizon having been created on the same day as heaven&nbsp;and earth).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהי מבדיל</span><span class="font5">, “so that it can serve as a separating domain, (between water and water.)” The horizon was supposed to&nbsp;raise itself. In other words, the horizon existed since the first&nbsp;day and had not yet begun to fulfill its function of being an&nbsp;atmosphere between heaven and earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: the answer to the question which “horizon” the Torah is speaking about in this verse, is that it&nbsp;is the one above the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">chavot.</span><span class="font5"> the highest category of angels&nbsp;in heaven. (Compare Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer chapter 4 That&nbsp;Rabbi quotes Ezekiel 1,22 as his source)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי כן</span><span class="font5">, “and so it came to be.” The meaning of the&nbsp;word: כן, is that what came to be then is still so nowadays.&nbsp;Actually, according the sequence of the subject matter&nbsp;discussed by the Torah this statement could have been&nbsp;expected already immediately after the words: בין מים למים,&nbsp;“between one type of water and the other type of water,” in&nbsp;verse 6. The reason it was not inserted there is that it might&nbsp;have misled us into thinking that the separation by itself&nbsp;constituted the completion of a creative act by G’d involving&nbsp;the water. Nonetheless, seeing that a certain stage of the&nbsp;separation of the waters had been concluded, the Torah saw&nbsp;fit to insert the line: “it was evening, it became morning, a&nbsp;second “day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our sages in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zohar</span><span class="font5"> on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Eykev</span><span class="font5"> page 273, state that one does not do things “in pairs.” What they mean&nbsp;is that just as in the story of creation something that had&nbsp;been commenced on one day was not completed until the&nbsp;second day, [to avoid creating both types of water on the&nbsp;same day, Ed] there is no need to complete on the same day&nbsp;other matters that one has commenced on a certain day. The&nbsp;quotation we cited from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zohar</span><span class="font5"> continues with: “just as&nbsp;one does not begin to do something in pairs so one should&nbsp;not complete it in “four.” The reason is that on the fourth&nbsp;“day,” the universe as we know it was completed; [except for&nbsp;the living creatures therein. Perhaps the deeper meaning of&nbsp;this is that man must not try to “copy” what G’d did at the&nbsp;time of creation so that he may not be viewed as competing&nbsp;with the Creator, as a form of idolatry. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the fact that we do not read that “G’d saw that it was good,” at the end of the report of the second “day” of His&nbsp;creative activity, the reason most likely is that on that day&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gehinom,</span><span class="font5"> purgatory, was also created, as stated in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> 54, and the Creator does not derive any&nbsp;satisfaction from having to consign any of His creatures to&nbsp;that region of the universe. We know this from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 39.&nbsp;Moreover it is written in Chronicles II 20,21: ויועץ אל העם&nbsp;ויעמד....בצאת לפני החלוץ ואמרים הודו לה' כי לעולם חסדו, “after</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">taking counsel with the people.....as they went forth ahead of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the vanguard, saying: ‘praise the Lord for His steadfast love is eternal.’” [The subject there is the miraculous salvation of&nbsp;Yehoshaphat and the army of Yehudah from a combined&nbsp;assault against them by three nations. Ed.] Our sages say&nbsp;that the reason that in this prayer of thanksgiving by the army&nbsp;of the King of Yehudah the attribute of G’d’s goodness is&nbsp;omitted, is that He does not enjoy the necessity of having&nbsp;had to kill His creatures, even when in fact they killed one&nbsp;another, as in that instance.(verse 23 there)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Elazar claims that on the sixth day of creation the Torah added the word: מאד, “very,” after the word טוב, “good,&nbsp;to make up for the missing “good” at the end of the report of&nbsp;what had been created on the second day.” (Compare&nbsp;Genesis 1,31)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,9. יקוו המים</span><span class="font5">, “let the waters be gathered together;” this is the conclusion of G’d’s creative activity of the second day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The רקיע, “atmosphere/horizon,” did not become operational until the earth had dried out. The reader is asked not to be&nbsp;astounded at the fact that the Torah had previously inserted&nbsp;the phrase: “it was evening, it was morning, the second day.”&nbsp;The reason why this is no contradiction as supposed at first&nbsp;glance, is that the meaning of the words: יקוו המים is that&nbsp;G’d’s commandment for the process of the waters gathering&nbsp;together had been issued already </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">the evening and&nbsp;subsequent morning of the second day. There are numerous&nbsp;such constructions in the Torah; we must not forget also, that&nbsp;both the gathering together of the water and the resultant&nbsp;visibility of the earth, were no new phenomena that could be&nbsp;described as “creation.” Expansion of one phenomenon so&nbsp;that another phenomenon could become visible is no basic&nbsp;change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,11. תדשא הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “let the earth sprout vegetation;” at this point the Torah begins with its report of G’d’s creative activity&nbsp;on the third “day”. The major result was that the surface of&nbsp;the earth became covered with different categories of&nbsp;vegetation including trees, in anticipation of G’d’s placing the&nbsp;luminaries in the sky on the fourth day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: the waters had already completed the process of contracting on the second day as part of that&nbsp;day’s activity, aided by the רקיע, horizon/atmosphere blowing&nbsp;itself up on the second day; for if the (upper) waters had not&nbsp;contracted, how could the earth beneath have become&nbsp;visible </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">already be covered with vegetation including&nbsp;trees?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עץ פרי</span><span class="font5">, “edible trees;” the earth did not carry out this part of G’d’s instructions, producing only trees with edible fruit&nbsp;instead. On the other hand, it produced more species of&nbsp;herbs than it had been instructed to. Bearing this in mind, we&nbsp;can deduce that the “earth’s” intention in doing so was not to&nbsp;countermand G’d, but was well intentioned. It reasoned that if&nbsp;the trunks were edible it would not take long before many&nbsp;such species of trees would die out, as the creatures on&nbsp;earth would consume both the fruit and the trunks. In spite of&nbsp;the earth’s, i.e. nature’s good intentions, when G’d cursed&nbsp;man as a result of his sin, the earth’s non compliance with&nbsp;the directive of its Creator was remembered and it was&nbsp;cursed also. This was in keeping with the principle expressed&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot</span><span class="font5"> 10, that when Chiskiyah said to G’d that he had&nbsp;not married as he foresaw that his children would become&nbsp;renegades, G’d asked him if that was a reason to refuse to&nbsp;carry out Hjs command?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[In other words, “never mind your good intentions, you must not countermand My orders to be fruitful and to&nbsp;multiply.” G’d did not need his advice about how to achieve&nbsp;His goals. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פרי</span><span class="font5">, “fruit(s) of;” this is one of numerous words in classical Hebrew which always appear in the singular mode;&nbsp;others are: שמש, sun, טף, children, שכר, reward, wages, כר,&nbsp;cushion, בצק, dough, to mention just a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,12. ועץ עושה פרי</span><span class="font5">, “and fruit bearing trees.” If you were to argue that there are many trees that do not bear fruit, the&nbsp;answer is that what the Torah really meant was that the fruit&nbsp;that the trees mentioned, were to be fruit matching its&nbsp;species, i.e. למינהו. Seeing that this definition would not apply&nbsp;to non fruit bearing trees, it is clear that the Torah did not&nbsp;mean that aj] trees were to be of the fruit-bearing kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי טוב</span><span class="font5">, “that it was good.” The reason why this word “good” appears twice in the report of G’d’s creative activity on&nbsp;the third “day,” is that on that day the garden in Eden was&nbsp;created (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pessikta zutrata</span><span class="font5"> 593)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,14. יהי מאורות</span><span class="font5">, “let there be luminaries;” it is the style of the Holy Scriptures to refer even to phenomena that exist in&nbsp;multiples as if they existed as individuals, by using the&nbsp;singular mode [יהי instead of יהיו, Ed.] Examples are: ויהי&nbsp;אנשים אשר היו טמאים “there were men who were ritually&nbsp;unclean,” [where we would have expected the Torah to have&nbsp;written: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ויהיו</span><span class="font5"> אנשים.] (Numbers 9,6) We should therefore&nbsp;understand the word יהי as referring to a creative act about to&nbsp;occur, and what follows as referring to the details, i.e. the&nbsp;answer to the question: “what was there to develop?” The&nbsp;answer is: “luminaries.” The term מאורות, reminds the reader&nbsp;that these luminaries were derivatives of the אור, light,&nbsp;created already on the first day. These derivatives were now&nbsp;divided into two separate light giving bodies, one larger than&nbsp;the other. They were named “sun,” and” moon,” respectively.&nbsp;As to the Torah adding: ואת הכוכבים, “and the stars,” this&nbsp;applies only to the execution of G’d’s directive, not to the&nbsp;directive itself. It is to teach us that these “stars” came into&nbsp;existence without a specific directive from the Creator, but as&nbsp;a result of fragments, sparks, resulting when G’d split the&nbsp;original luminary into sun and moon respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מארת</span><span class="font5">, the word is spelled defectively, the letter ו of the plural ending being absent. The reason it is spelled defective&nbsp;is that the stars were not meant to dispense light but were&nbsp;meant to guide us navigationally merely by being visible, and&nbsp;to help us tell time as they appeared at regular intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ברקיע השמים</span><span class="font5">, “in the part of the horizon that spans the atmosphere.” [like an umbrella. Ed.] It is positioned below the&nbsp;upper layers of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">להבדיל בין היום ובין הלילה </span><span class="font5">“to form a visible partition between day and night.” The sun separates day from the&nbsp;preceding night, whereas the moon separates what follows&nbsp;after the day that preceded it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיו לאותות</span><span class="font5">, “they will serve as (backgrounds to) miracles; such as when their orbits were arrested temporarily at the&nbsp;command of Joshua (Joshua 24,17) when he reminded the&nbsp;people of that. On an individual basis, G’d performed such a&nbsp;miracle for King Chizkiyahu to confirm that he had been&nbsp;granted an additional 15 years of life. (Kings II 20,9-11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different way of understanding these words: the constellation of the stars will serve astrologers as indications&nbsp;when foretelling certain events in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולמועדים</span><span class="font5">, and to determine certain calendar events which are tied to specific dates by the Torah, such as observance&nbsp;of the new moon, the fifteenth of Nissan as the day when the&nbsp;first day of Passover is to be observes, the sixth of Sivan for&nbsp;the observance of the festival commemorating the revelation&nbsp;and the giving of the Torah, etc. David confirmed this as one&nbsp;of the meanings of this term when he said in Psalms 104,19:&nbsp;עשה ירח למועדים שמש ידע מבואו, “He made the moon to mark&nbsp;the seasons, the sun knows when to set.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,15. ברקיע השמים להאיר על הארץ</span><span class="font5">, ”in the sky of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">heavens to disseminate light all over the earth.” One of the luminaries’ functions is similar to that of lanterns which are&nbsp;also always placed on high poles to better illuminate their&nbsp;surroundings. According to the plain meaning of the text, the&nbsp;sun and moon are necessary to illuminate earth, whereas the&nbsp;light created on the first “day,” is needed to illuminate the&nbsp;heavenly regions, seeing that on the second “day,” a partition&nbsp;had been erected between the former and the latter by the&nbsp;horizon/atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternately, when the Torah reported that on the first “day” light came into existence, i.e. ויהי אור, this was the&nbsp;“light” which enabled “life” to exist, whereas here we speak&nbsp;about the light provided by the sun and moon respectively.&nbsp;Although as yet this “light” was not needed as the creatures&nbsp;for which the sun and moon were to shine had not been&nbsp;created yet, there were grasses and fruit bearing trees which&nbsp;needed it in order for them not to wither and die. The fruit&nbsp;could not have ripened without the rays of the sun. We also&nbsp;know from Deuteronomy 33,14, that there are plants which&nbsp;cannot grow without moonlight. Furthermore, G’d had&nbsp;created some living creatures such as creeping things and&nbsp;birds on the fifth “day,” and the means for their survival had&nbsp;to exist before they came into existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,16. המאורות הגדולים</span><span class="font5">, “the large luminaries;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> this means that they were originally of equal size and&nbsp;strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other commentators say that the meaning of the word גדולים is that they remained as large as they had been&nbsp;created. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> also states that the moon was downsized as it&nbsp;had claimed that it is impossible for two queens to rule side&nbsp;by side with equal powers as this would lead to jealousy and&nbsp;friction between them. G’d agreed and suggested that the&nbsp;moon downsize itself in order for harmony to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators claim that the moon downsized itself at the beginning of each monthly orbit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">הגדולים, “the term is used to describe how the sun and moon appear to us when compared to the stars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לממשלת היום, </span><span class="font5">“to rule by day;” to enable the fruit to ripen due to receiving the sun’s warmth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לממשלת הלילה, </span><span class="font5">to rule by night in order to cool off the plants so that they would not generate worms. The light&nbsp;created on the first “day,” could not be described as “ruling,”&nbsp;as it did not generate any fruit, or otherwise demonstrate&nbsp;tangible benefits to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,18. ולמשול ביום ובלילה, </span><span class="font5">“and to rule during the day and the night.” One would rule by day, the other by night. The&nbsp;moon even when visible by day, hardly “rules.” Or, in the&nbsp;words of the moon itself, quoted in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;60, “who needs light at noontime?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולהבדיל בין האור ובין החשך, </span><span class="font5">“and in order to make a clear separation between periods of light and periods of darkness.”&nbsp;This phrase does not refer to either the sun or the moon. The&nbsp;Torah had already told us in verse 14 that this would be the&nbsp;function of the great luminaries. The phrase therefore refers&nbsp;to the stars, whose visibility tells us if it is day or night. They&nbsp;become visible when day fades, and they fade when dawn&nbsp;approaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,20. ישרצו המים</span><span class="font5">, “let the waters swarm, etc.” After G’d had positioned the luminaries in the places assigned to them,&nbsp;G’d proceeded to create living creatures. All stationary&nbsp;waters, even water in small vessels, will generate life after a&nbsp;while. Each such form of “life” will continue to reproduce,&nbsp;each according to its kind. This is the reason why the Torah&nbsp;here did not refer to: הימים, “the oceans,” or to הנהרות, “the&nbsp;streams.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">רקיע השמים; </span><span class="font5">there are many places in the Torah where the air (atmosphere) is simply referred to as שמים, to name&nbsp;just one such example: Deuteronomy 4,17, אשר תעוף בשמים,&nbsp;“which flies in the air.” [It would not occur to any thinking&nbsp;person to translate this line as “which flies in the heaven,” or&nbsp;even: “in the sky.” Ed.] Consider also Exodus 10,21 where&nbsp;Moses had been told: נטה ידך על השמים, which no one would&nbsp;understand as Moses being asked to “extend his hand above&nbsp;the heaven,“ but as an instruction to extend his hand over the&nbsp;air in front of him. The Torah also describes Canaanites as&nbsp;possessing cities fortified בשמים (Deuteronomy 9,1) which no&nbsp;one in his right mind would translate as “fortified right into&nbsp;heaven,” but would understand as the walls “rising high into&nbsp;the surrounding airspace.” The reason that we do not find the&nbsp;customary expression ויהי כן, “and so it came to be,” at the&nbsp;end of the report of G’d’s activities on the fifth day, is&nbsp;because seeing that the fish were created on that day and by&nbsp;far the greatest majority of them are never seen by man, it&nbsp;was not considered appropriate to insert that conclusion&nbsp;here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,22. פרו ורבו בימים והעוף ירב בארץ</span><span class="font5">, “be fruitful and multiply in the oceans, and let the birds multiply on earth.” The&nbsp;reason why G’d did not extend a similarly worded blessing&nbsp;for the mammals was so that they should not increase at a&nbsp;faster rate than the human race and man would not be able&nbsp;to prevail against them. Birds and fish whose habitat is the&nbsp;airspace and the seas respectively, do not pose a similar&nbsp;problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,24. תוצא הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “let the earth bring forth;” when it comes to producing creatures whose habitat is earth, creatures&nbsp;equipped with a נפש, a life force, [of some spiritual dimension,&nbsp;my words, Editor.] we find that G’d created 4 different&nbsp;species, i.e. חיה, בהמה, ורמש, וחיתו ארץ, but when they are&nbsp;listed separately only 3 of them, the ones that are almost&nbsp;exclusively made up of bodies, are listed before the Torah&nbsp;states that “G’d saw that it was good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Man is the fourth of these species, and that it why the Torah continues 2,7 ויהי האדם לנפש חיה that the human&nbsp;species became part of that group only after G’d having&nbsp;provided it with a Divine soul, נשמת חיים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,26. נעשה אדם</span><span class="font5">, “let Us make a human being;” it is&nbsp;remarkable that the Torah did not write: נברא אדם, “let us&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">create</span><span class="font5"> a human being;” the reason is that the first step, i.e.&nbsp;בריאה, is something that only the Creator Himself is able to&nbsp;perform, He cannot share this step of the process with any of&nbsp;His creatures. Compare Genesis 1,27: ויברא האלוקים את האדם,&nbsp;“the Lord created Adam, (no plural mode here); or compare&nbsp;Genesis 6,7: האדם אשר בראתי, “the human being whom I&nbsp;created.” When it comes to secondary or tertiary stages, G’d&nbsp;may co-opt other forces in His endeavor. [Compare Kimchi&nbsp;on Isaiah 6,8 on the word לנו; Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: we find a similar formula: “let us interpret,” in Daniel, 2,36 where Daniel offers to reveal the&nbsp;meaning of the king’s dream, but only he </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">himself</span><span class="font5"> in a private&nbsp;audience with King Nebuchadnezzar will actually reveal it&nbsp;[out of deference to the King, since it contained unpleasant&nbsp;news. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נעשה אדם</span><span class="font5">, the word אדם includes males and females. Proof that this is so is found in Genesis 5,2, when both the&nbsp;males and the females of the species are described as&nbsp;having been “created,” i.e. בראם, “He had created them;” we&nbsp;also have a statement by Rav Hunna, who asks the&nbsp;rhetorical question: ‘how do we know that Chava was also&nbsp;called אדם? Answer (Isaiah 44,13) כתפארת אדם לשבת בית,&nbsp;which is translated by the Targum as: “like the beauty of a&nbsp;woman who resides in a house; (or who transforms a house&nbsp;into a home).” Furthermore, we have a verse in Numbers&nbsp;31,35: ונפש אדם מן הנשים, “and human souls, of the women;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בצלמנו</span><span class="font5">, “in our likeness,” comparable to angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כ</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דמותנו</span><span class="font5">, “like the image of the angels.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This comparison of the human species to that of angels is going to stand man in good stead when exercising his&nbsp;authority (superiority) over all the other creatures on earth&nbsp;G’d had created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis of the word: כדמותנו: seeing that it is impossible to compare human beings to the Creator, seeing&nbsp;that Isaiah 40,8 has already stated that this is impossible,&nbsp;(Isaiah 40,18) but on the other hand, it is also impossible to&nbsp;compare human beings to the creatures G’d had created&nbsp;before He created the human species, as in that case what&nbsp;advantage would this species have over the beasts created&nbsp;before him, there was no other way to describe our&nbsp;superiority except by comparing it to Divinity in some degree,&nbsp;i.e. as “a shadow of our essence,” בצלמנו כדמותנו; [just as a&nbsp;shadow is only a two dimensional likeness of the person or&nbsp;object it reflects, so the human beings are lacking in some&nbsp;dimension possessed only by their Creator. My words, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The common denominator between G’d and man on the one hand, and man and beast on the other, is that just as G’d&nbsp;is our ruler, so we rule over the other creatures in the&nbsp;universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובכל הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “and over the whole globe;” what had the Torah omitted to mention regarding man’s dominion over the&nbsp;creatures on earth, so that this additional term was needed?&nbsp;It is a reference to spiritual, non corporeal forces that abound&nbsp;in our universe and appear to interfere with our freedom,&nbsp;especially demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,27. בצלמו</span><span class="font5">, a metaphor for the angels; do not wonder&nbsp;why the Torah had not spelled out the creation of the angels&nbsp;in the report of G’d’s creative activities; Moses had&nbsp;deliberately refrained from writing down anything about either&nbsp;the domains of heaven or purgatory or about other details&nbsp;such as the heavenly Court, etc.; as the purpose of the&nbsp;written Torah is to acquaint us with phenomena visible in our&nbsp;habitat, as I have already pointed out earlier (verse 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis of the word: בצלמו: it is a reference to G’d Himself; G’d wished to forestall people who would view&nbsp;Him as reflection of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">their</span><span class="font5"> image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Unfortunately, people have a tendency of describing something unknown to them as in some manner reflecting&nbsp;phenomena with which they are familiar. In other words, they&nbsp;make G’d over in their own image by using their own&nbsp;attributes as the yardsticks by which they “measure” Divinity.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בצלם אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, as similar to angels. When angels appear to human beings on earth, as in the case of the three angels&nbsp;that appeared to Avraham before the destruction of Sodom,&nbsp;or the angel that appeared to the wife of Manoach telling her&nbsp;that she would give birth to Shimshon, they had assumed the&nbsp;countenances of human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is also how we must understand the serpent saying to Chavah in Genesis 3,5: והייתם כאלוקים “and you will be like&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Proof that this interpretation is correct can be traced to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bereshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 20,4: where it is pointed out that the word&nbsp;אלוקים appears 71 times in the Torah prior to G’d speaking to&nbsp;the serpent in Genesis 3,14. If you were to include the&nbsp;expressions: בצלם אלוקים and והיית כאלוקים, in that count,&nbsp;there would be 73 mentions of the name of G’d instead of 71&nbsp;as stated in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash.</span><span class="font5"> It is clear therefore that here the&nbsp;expression is meant to make a comparison between man&nbsp;and angels. This is also the reason why the Targum&nbsp;(Onkelos) did not translate the word כאלוקים in 3,8 as “you&nbsp;will become like G’d.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another exegesis for the expression בצלם אלוקים ברא אותו, “He created man to appear like a judge and person of&nbsp;authority.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another exegesis: “as opposed to the other creatures whom G’d created by means of an oral directive;&nbsp;when creating the human species He had first created a&nbsp;mould,” (pattern) i.e. He had taken extra care about every&nbsp;detail. This was already proof of the importance G’d&nbsp;attributed to the creature called .אדם</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זכר ונקבה ברא אותם</span><span class="font5">, “He created them as possessing male and female organs.” This is explained in greater detail in&nbsp;Genesis 2,21, where the physical separation of the female&nbsp;from Adam is described as G’d building up one of Adam’s&nbsp;ribs into a whole new body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,28. פרו ורבו</span><span class="font5">, “be fruitful and multiply.” Some&nbsp;commentators believe that after Adam and his wife had&nbsp;sinned and as a result had been condemned to be mortal;&nbsp;G’d told them to multiply and thereby to insure their vicarious&nbsp;survival through their offspring. If this command (or blessing)&nbsp;which included the word: “and fill the earth,” had been issued&nbsp;prior to their sin, the impression would have been created&nbsp;that Adam’s offspring was meant to populate and eventually&nbsp;overpopulate the garden in Eden. The reason it was already&nbsp;written here is that having offspring is the nearest thing to&nbsp;creating another human being, and this had been the subject&nbsp;at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכבשה</span><span class="font5">, “and conquer it, subdue it.” The word is written defectively, as it is it in the imperative mode; if it had been&nbsp;spelled with the dot (in the letter ב) it would have been&nbsp;transformed into a past mode, as in Joel 2,6 קבצו.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,29-30. הנה נתתי לכם</span><span class="font5">, “here I have given to you, etc.” The line is to be understood as if written in the present tense,&nbsp;“I am giving to you’” there are numerous such verses which&nbsp;though written in the past tense, actually were meant to be&nbsp;understood as being in the present tense. The author quotes&nbsp;a few examples, including: Genesis 14,22; 23,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את כל עשב זורע זרע</span><span class="font5">, “all the herbs that perpetuate themselves by shedding their seed.” Examples are grains&nbsp;and vegetables such as peas and beans, etc; as well as the&nbsp;fruit of the trees which contain stones or pips. All these were&nbsp;intended as food for the human race. The beasts of the field&nbsp;were assigned only simpler herbs, i.e. grass that did not&nbsp;perpetuate itself by shedding their seeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a result of man’s sin, G’d decreed that they would be limited to eating the same kind of food as did the animals.&nbsp;This is the deeper meaning of the verse in Genesis 3,18: קוץ&nbsp;ודרדר תצמיח לך ואכלת את עשב השדה, “the earth will grow thorns&nbsp;and thistles in (response to your efforts) so that you will be&nbsp;reduced to eating the grass of the field.” This is also reflected&nbsp;in Psalms 49,21: “he is like the beasts (that perish)”. If G’d&nbsp;had permitted man at that stage to eat meat, it would have&nbsp;been viewed as man being r</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ewarded</span><span class="font5"> for having sinned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכ</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יהיה לאכלה ולכל חית השדה, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this line that man had been reduced to eat the same kind of food&nbsp;as the beasts of the field. When we find the statement in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 59, that the angels in heaven were purifying wine&nbsp;for Adam and roasting meat for him while he was sitting in&nbsp;the garden (on the Sabbath), which appears to contradict the&nbsp;aforesaid, this refers to meat that had descended from&nbsp;heaven just as the manna descended from heaven for the&nbsp;Israelites in the desert. When G’d had told man that they&nbsp;would rule over the fish in the sea, etc.; this did not mean&nbsp;that he was allowed to eat them, but that they were to&nbsp;perform work on his behalf, as pointed out on the same folio&nbsp;in the Talmud. The Talmud explains that even birds could be&nbsp;trained to perform menial tasks for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובכל החיה הרומשת על הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “and to all the living creatures that creep on the earth.” This is a reference to the serpent&nbsp;alluded to in verse 28. It can serve man as carrier of&nbsp;messages as spelled out in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,31. וירא אלוקי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את כל אשר עשה וגו</span><span class="font5">׳ , “G’d saw, (reviewed) all that He had done, etc;” He even included the evil urge in&nbsp;what he described as being “very good,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנה טוב מאד</span><span class="font5">, “and here it was very good;” why was even the evil urge “very good?” Without it man would not possess&nbsp;an active libido, without which siring offspring would have&nbsp;been next to impossible. Unless man reproduced, the&nbsp;species the human race would have died out and would have&nbsp;been created in vain. The expression: כי טוב, occurs twice in&nbsp;connection with G’d’s activities on that day, once in&nbsp;connection with the mammals, and again in connection with&nbsp;the creation of the first human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יום השישי</span><span class="font5">, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">the</span><span class="font5"> sixth day.” The prefix ה reminds us of the special role of that day as it was the only day on which G’d&nbsp;completed the entire process of creating the universe. This&nbsp;hint is repeated more clearly in Exodus 20,1, (the fourth of&nbsp;the Ten Commandments) where we read: 'כי ששת ימים עשה ה&nbsp;את השמים ואת הארץ, “for during an unbroken string of six days,&nbsp;the Lord created heaven and earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,1. ויכל אלוקים ביום השביעי</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord had completed on the seventh day;” at first glance this wording gives the&nbsp;impression as if G’d had still been working on the seventh&nbsp;day; seeing that on the sixth day it had not yet been known&nbsp;that this was the last day on which G’d performed creative&nbsp;activities, there is no contradiction. This became known only&nbsp;in retrospect on the seventh day through G’d’s abstaining&nbsp;from any such activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">השביעי, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">The seventh;”</span><span class="font5"> this day too has the prefix ה, as it was a day reserved for rest from physical activity, something&nbsp;that is taboo on all the other days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,3. ויברך אלוקים את יום השביעי</span><span class="font5">, “G’d blessed the seventh day.”[If I understand the author correctly, he does not&nbsp;understand the word ויברך here as in the immediate past, but&nbsp;as description of the state of the universe on that day as a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">result</span><span class="font5"> of its Creator having blessed it previously. Ed.] On this&nbsp;day the world was in a state of perfection full of everything&nbsp;positive, and fully satisfied. Compare Deuteronomy 5,14: אשר&nbsp;ברכך ה' אלוקיך תתן לו, “that the Lord your G’d has blessed you&nbsp;with, give him of it.” (the departing servant). This is also what&nbsp;we recite regularly in our prayers: “You have blessed it more&nbsp;than any other days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקדש אותו </span><span class="font5">“He sanctified it;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this refers to the fact that the manna would not descend to earth&nbsp;on that day. [Maybe </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> means that the Sabbath rest is&nbsp;observed also in the celestial regions. Ed.] If you were to&nbsp;counter that on festival days the manna did not descend&nbsp;either, as we read in Exodus 6,26: וביום השביעי לא יהיה בו , and&nbsp;our sages in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta,</span><span class="font5"> (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi) claim that&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">this verse was written only in order to include the day of&nbsp;Atonement and the other Festivals as days on which no&nbsp;manna descended, we have to remember that the festivals&nbsp;are frequently also referred to as Sabbaths, so that there was&nbsp;no need for a special verse to include those days as days on&nbsp;which the manna would not descend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis of these words: the meaning of “He sanctified it,” is that no creative activity was to be performed&nbsp;on that day, seeing that the Creator Himself had abstained&nbsp;from carrying out such an activity on that day. The idea that a&nbsp;day known as שבת must be sanctified even if it is not the&nbsp;seventh day of the week, is demonstrated when the Torah in&nbsp;Leviticus 23,3 calls that day שבת שבתון, before adding that&nbsp;this is the reason that no work may be performed on it. The&nbsp;day of Atonement is also called שבת שבתון (Leviticus 16,31)&nbsp;although most of the time it does not occur on the seventh&nbsp;day of the week. It makes sense therefore that because it is&nbsp;also a שבת שבתון, the rules about work prohibition are&nbsp;identical to those occurring every week on the seventh day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי בו שבת</span><span class="font5">, the word שבת when applied to G’d, cannot mean “He rested,” in the sense this term is commonly used,&nbsp;as we have it on the authority of Isaiah 40,28 that G’d never&nbsp;“grows faint or weary;” seeing that He did not have to exert&nbsp;Himself when creating the universe, why should He have&nbsp;been tired so that would have to “rest?” The word has to be&nbsp;understood as G’d having put a temporary stop to an activity.&nbsp;We find a similar term used when the regular descent on&nbsp;weekdays of the manna came to a halt after the Israelites&nbsp;had crossed the Jordan, (Joshua 5,12) before they&nbsp;commenced eating from the produce of the land of Canaan.&nbsp;Both events are reported there as having occurred on the&nbsp;same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We also find the verb </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבת </span><span class="font5">used in the sense of an interruption Job 32,1 when Job’s friends interrupted their&nbsp;arguing with Job for three days out of their respect for his&nbsp;righteousness. An even better proof is Genesis 8,22, where&nbsp;G’d assures Noach after the deluge that the regular&nbsp;phenomenon of day and night following one another will&nbsp;never again be suspended, i.e. יום ולילה לא ישבתו, “day and&nbsp;night will occur without interruption.” Neither day nor night will&nbsp;take “a break from their routine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מכל מלאכתו אשר עשה, </span><span class="font5">“from all His work</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">a reference to the functioning henceforth of the earth and its inhabitants, i.e.&nbsp;living creatures developing and multiplying, trees producing&nbsp;fruit, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternative exegesis of the phrase; the word: לעשות at the end of this verse refers to the continuity of this process&nbsp;for as long as earth would exist. This would be the Torah’s,&nbsp;i.e. G’d’s answer, to the heretics who claim that G’d performs&nbsp;His activities on the Sabbath seeing that He allows it to rain&nbsp;and bring about the growing and ripening of trees and crops&nbsp;on that day. This is utter nonsense, as these processes had&nbsp;all been part of the directive given by G’d when these&nbsp;phenomena or creatures were first </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">created</span><span class="font5">. The Torah here&nbsp;states categorically that G’d does nothing of the sort. Proof of&nbsp;this is that the fact that manna which, because G’d had not&nbsp;created it, i.e. it had not descended to earth during the first&nbsp;six days of the universe, was also not allowed to descend on&nbsp;the Sabbath, and it also had never been seen until after the&nbsp;Jewish people had left Egypt; all this refutes the theory that&nbsp;G’d “works” on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet another exegesis of our verse: the emphasis in our verse is on the expression </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אשר ברא לעשות</span><span class="font5">, instead of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אשר עשה;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">we are told here that the various types of destructive forces&nbsp;with which the earth seems to abound at time, were only&nbsp;“created,” i.e. were only made </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">possible</span><span class="font5"> by G’d, but were not&nbsp;developed into finished products, i.e. powered by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font5">. G’d&nbsp;did not have time to completely fashion those destructive&nbsp;forces until dusk on the sixth day when it had already turned&nbsp;dark, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash Tanchuma</span><span class="font5"> (ancient version) tells us on&nbsp;B’reshit 17. According to this exegesis our verse refers only&nbsp;to the constructive phenomena that G’d had created while it&nbsp;was still daylight on the sixth day. The reason that the Torah,&nbsp;at the end of its report on G’d’s “activity” on the seventh day&nbsp;does not conclude with the words: “it was evening it was&nbsp;morning,” is that there had been no evening; the entire&nbsp;Sabbath had been a day bathed in full light. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit&nbsp;Rabbah,11,2.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,4. 'אלה תולדות השמים והארץ וגו</span><span class="font5">, “these are the derivatives of heaven and earth, etc.; seeing that in the first&nbsp;chapter the Torah had been extremely concise on a number&nbsp;of aspects of the story of creation, the Torah now fills in&nbsp;some of these gaps, by explaining more about the “how” of&nbsp;that period. We have a statement by Rabbi Abahu, quoted in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 12,3, according to which every time in the&nbsp;Holy Scriptures when a paragraph commences with the&nbsp;word: אלה, this is meant to indicate that a state of affairs&nbsp;which had been described as in effect previously, is no&nbsp;longer valid. On the other hand, if a paragraph commences&nbsp;with the word: ואלה, this is meant to indicate that what follows&nbsp;is a continuation of a state of affairs that already been in&nbsp;existence. The state of affairs that the word אלה in our verse&nbsp;is to supersede is that of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tohu vavohu,</span><span class="font5"> chaos and darkness,&nbsp;which the Torah had introduced in Genesis. 1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תולדות השמים</span><span class="font5">. This is a reference to the luminaries and the stars as well as to all the phenomena that are part of the&nbsp;celestial regions, including fire (lightning) hail, tornados, etc.;&nbsp;However during the reign of King David, the latter succeeded&nbsp;in making most of these phenomena part of our terrestrial&nbsp;world. (Compare Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chagigah</span><span class="font5"> 12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והארץ</span><span class="font5">, this is a reference to both living creatures, and all manner of vegetation on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום עשות</span><span class="font5">, at the time when heaven and earth had first been created, i.e. on the first day. All of these phenomena&nbsp;mentioned already on the first day, G’d had completed during&nbsp;the following five “days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום עשות ה' אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “on the day the Lord G’d had completed;” now that heaven and earth had been completely&nbsp;built up, the Torah for the first time reveals G’d’s full name in&nbsp;accordance with the principle we have learned from Proverbs&nbsp;14,28 that ברב עם הדרת מלך “when there is a multitude the&nbsp;king’s real honour becomes manifest.” We find this principle&nbsp;invoked also in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot</span><span class="font5"> 49 where the Talmud says: ”one&nbsp;does not invoke the tetragram when preparing to recite grace&nbsp;after a meal unless there are at least 10 adult males&nbsp;present.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The author quotes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> as commenting on our verse that G’d, now that there were free willed human beings on&nbsp;earth, co-opted the attribute of mercy so that He would not&nbsp;automatically have to destroy His universe when man sinned.&nbsp;This has been hinted at in the prefix letter ו before the line: 'וה&nbsp;שמים עשה, “and the Lord (by contrast) completed the heaven.”&nbsp;[This quote is not found in our editions of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on this verse.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארץ ושמים</span><span class="font5">, “earth and heaven.” Previously, in 1,1 the Torah had listed heaven before referring to earth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash&nbsp;Tanchuma</span><span class="font5"> comments on this that when speaking of the&nbsp;creation of something out of nothing, i.e. the stage known as&nbsp;בריאה, heaven preceded earth chronologically, whereas when&nbsp;speaking of the completion of their coming into existence,&nbsp;earth was completed first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,6. ואד, </span><span class="font5">“and a kind of mist;” the letter ו at the beginning off the word אד, appears to be superfluous; there are&nbsp;numerous such apparently superfluous prefixes ו in the&nbsp;Torah. As a result, -in order not to have to consider that letter&nbsp;as superfluous,- our author suggests that the meaning of the&nbsp;two verses 5-6 must be understood thus: “all the grasses etc.&nbsp;in the field were in a state of suspense after having been&nbsp;created, as only a kind of mist had been rising from the earth&nbsp;due to the influence of sun and moon, this being only&nbsp;sufficient to provide minimal moisture for these herbs. The&nbsp;section of the verse commencing with: for “G’d had not yet let&nbsp;it rain, nor had there been a human being to till the earth,”&nbsp;interrupts the story in order to provide us with the reason why&nbsp;none of these plants have been reported as growing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יעלה, </span><span class="font5">“would rise;” the word must be understood as being in the past tense. Compare Genesis 8,20: ויעל עולות במזבח,&nbsp;“he (Noach) would offer burnt offerings on the altar.” (past&nbsp;tense).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,7-9. וייצר ה' אלוקים את האדם</span><span class="font5">, “G’d shaped the human being;” seeing that the Torah wished to write that G’d placed&nbsp;man inside the garden, it repeated part of the process by&nbsp;which man was created, [showing that G’d was active in his&nbsp;creation beyond the initial stages. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The words: ויטע, “He planted,” and ויצמח, “He made grow,” were written in order to lead up to the story of the tree&nbsp;of knowledge, and the commandment forbidding man to eat&nbsp;from that tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויפח באפיו נשמת חימם</span><span class="font5">, “He blew into his nostrils a living soul.” G’d personally blew the breath of life into the human&nbsp;being, something He had not done for any of His other&nbsp;creatures. Why was all this necessary? This was in order to&nbsp;enable man to have the wisdom, i.e. holy spirit, to enable him&nbsp;when viewing all the animals to name them correctly after&nbsp;having discerned how each was different from the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נשמת חיים</span><span class="font5">, “an immortal soul,” surviving the death of the body it inhabits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישם שם את האדם</span><span class="font5">, “He placed Adam inside it.” When&nbsp;Adam had been created he did not find himself in the garden,&nbsp;for if he had been created in the garden he would have&nbsp;thought that the entire earth is such a garden. G’d&nbsp;deliberately created him outside the garden in order to show&nbsp;him that the rest of the earth was overgrown with thorns and&nbsp;thistles. His transfer to the garden, it was hoped, would make&nbsp;him grateful for having been placed in such a superior&nbsp;environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויטע</span><span class="font5">, this has to be understood as “He had planted.” The same applies to the statement: ויצמח, “He </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">had</span><span class="font5"> made it grow.”&nbsp;The plants had preceded the creation of man (Rabbi Shmuel&nbsp;son of Nachmeni, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah,</span><span class="font5"> 15,3) is on record as&nbsp;saying that if we thought Gan Eden had preceded the&nbsp;creation of the universe this is an error. It only preceded the&nbsp;creation of Adam. [This is a reference to the word: מקדם,&nbsp;“previously;” Ed] When the Talmud stated in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> 54&nbsp;that one of the phenomena that were created before “the&nbsp;world,” was גן עדן, the meaning is: “before the universe had&nbsp;been completed, i.e. on the third “day”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועץ הדעת טוב ורע, </span><span class="font5">“as well as the tree of knowledge&nbsp;about good and evil.” The meaning is that eating from the&nbsp;fruit of that tree would give that person knowledge of the&nbsp;difference between good and evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר שם הזהב </span><span class="font5">The word: חוילה, occurs in the Torah&nbsp;twice more, once in Genesis 10,7, and once in verse 29 of&nbsp;that chapter. Therefore the Torah wished to indicate that the&nbsp;gold mentioned here is that which used to be brought from&nbsp;Ophir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזהב הארץ ההיא טוב</span><span class="font5">, “and the gold originating from&nbsp;that area is good.” What is meant is that it lends itself to&nbsp;amalgamation with copper, without losing its appearance as&nbsp;gold. Actually, this is no more than logical; if the gold found in&nbsp;the rivers emanating from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gan Eden</span><span class="font5"> was “good,” the gold&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">inside</span><span class="font5"> the garden surely must be good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,14. קדמת אשור</span><span class="font5">, the letter ת at the end of the word: קדמת is in lieu of the letter ה, as in קדמה. Sometimes the Torah also&nbsp;uses the letter ה as a suffix instead of the letter ל as a prefix&nbsp;as in למזרח אשור “east of Ashur.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא פרת</span><span class="font5">, “known to the Israelites at the time when the Torah was given as the river Euphrates.” It borders the larger&nbsp;land of Israel, as in G’d’s promise to Avraham in Genesis&nbsp;15,18. Seeing that this river was well known, the Torah only&nbsp;needed to write “הוא פרת,” the one known as Euphrates. More&nbsp;details had to be given about the other three rivers as the&nbsp;reader would not have known which rivers were meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">לעבדה, “to irrigate it;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולשמרה, </span><span class="font5">“and to protect it against animals that would trample it.” The Torah speaks of a period prior to when the&nbsp;angels with drawn swords would prevent entry into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gan&nbsp;Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of these two words: the word לעבדה, is to be understood as in Exodus 20,8, i.e. ששת ימים&nbsp;תעבוד, “during the six days you are to work, etc;” and the&nbsp;word: לשמרה, is to be understood as in Deuteronomy 5,12:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שמור את יום השבת</span><span class="font5">, “observe the Sabbath,” in other words, G’d&nbsp;commanded Adam already at that time to observe the&nbsp;seventh day of the week as we observe the Sabbath after the&nbsp;Torah had been given, by not performing work on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,16. ויצו ה' אלוקים על האדם; </span><span class="font5">“the Lord G’d issued a command to Adam, etc.” This is not to be considered as a&nbsp;test which G’d wanted to subject Adam to, seeing that He&nbsp;knows all that was, is, and will be. He commanded Adam not&nbsp;to eat from the tree in order to demonstrate to the angels&nbsp;who had appealed for G’d’s mercy on his behalf, that this&nbsp;Adam to whom they had looked with that much respect and&nbsp;almost awe, did not even have the power to resist the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">temptation to which G’d had subjected him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 60 derive from this verse that G’d issued the seven universal commandments for mankind&nbsp;at this time. Each of them is hinted at in the words of this&nbsp;verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצו</span><span class="font5">, a reference to establishing courts and judges to deal with disputes and violations of G’d’s commandments.&nbsp;The Torah refers to this again in Genesis 18,19 when&nbsp;explaining why G’d discusses the imminent destruction of the&nbsp;Sodomites with Avraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'ה</span><span class="font5">, a reference to G’d’s “honour,” i.e. a hint that blasphemers must be punished. (Compare Leviticus 24,16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, a hint not to practice paganism, as spelled out in Exodus 20,3, “you must not have other deities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על האדם</span><span class="font5">, a hint forbidding the shedding of human blood, (murder). This has been spelled out in greater detail in&nbsp;Genesis 9,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאמור</span><span class="font5">, this is a hint not to commit incest and other forbidden forms of gratifying one’s libido. It is spelled out&nbsp;clearly in Jeremiah 3,1, where the prophet condemns legal&nbsp;maneuvers by “divorcing” a wife so she can legally sleep with&nbsp;another partner, all the while intending to take her back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מכל עץ הגן</span><span class="font5">, an allusion to not commit robbery, i.e. unless we have permission from the Creator to enjoy what He&nbsp;placed on earth for that person it is considered as if we had&nbsp;robbed Him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אכל תאכל</span><span class="font5">, a hint not to eat flesh from an animal&nbsp;that is still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During Avraham’s time G’d added another command (for his descendants only) circumcision of the males.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During Yaakov’s lifetime another prohibition was added, (by him?) namely, not to eat the גיד הנשה, the thigh muscle&nbsp;near the hip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the lifetime of Yaakov’ son Yehudah, the law for a surviving brother, under certain circumstances to marry the&nbsp;widow of his deceased brother, was added. This law is&nbsp;known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yibbum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Israelites added the commandment to honour father and mother. This commandment preceded the Ten&nbsp;Commandments, and was apparently introduced as part of&nbsp;the commandments mentioned when the people were&nbsp;encamped around a place called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">marah</span><span class="font5"> where the bitter&nbsp;waters had been made sweet. (Exodus 15,25).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על האדם</span><span class="font5">, the commandment applied not only to the first human being, but to all subsequent generations; this is&nbsp;implied in the prefix ה, as it would be unnecessary otherwise;&nbsp;after all there was as yet only one human being. Or, if the&nbsp;command applied only to this first human being, the Torah&nbsp;should have written: את האדם, instead of על האדם, an&nbsp;expression that includes the entire human species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מכל עץ הגן אכל תאכל</span><span class="font5">, “you are encouraged to eat of the fruit of every tree in the garden;” if that were literally so, we&nbsp;might think that man was allowed to eat also of the tree of&nbsp;life? You would be wrong. The tree of life did not present a&nbsp;challenge to Adam as he was as yet immortal, and could not&nbsp;understand the purpose of such a tree. Moreover, according&nbsp;to tradition, Adam spent an entire 3 hours of his life in that&nbsp;garden. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 38)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to say that during those three hours Adam had indeed eaten from the fruit of that tree, so how could&nbsp;death have been decreed for him after that? If that were so&nbsp;the tree of knowledge would have been misnamed and&nbsp;should have been named the “tree of death,” as its fruit&nbsp;brought about man’s mortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternately, it is possible that eating from the tree of life would serve as an antidote for people who had eaten from&nbsp;the tree of knowledge. This would explain why G’d became&nbsp;concerned about Adam eating from the tree of life only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">he had eaten from the tree of knowledge, Alternately, if he&nbsp;were to eat from the tree of life a second time, he might&nbsp;become immortal as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis of the whole verse: The words: “you may surely eat from all the trees of the garden,” did not&nbsp;include eating from the tree of life, as G’d forbade eating&nbsp;from the tree in the middle of the garden (3,3 and 3,9)&nbsp;Onkelos also translates 2,9 that the tree of knowledge was&nbsp;located in the center of the garden; it may well be that both&nbsp;the tree of life and the tree of knowledge were in fact in the&nbsp;middle of the garden, the tree of knowledge surrounding the&nbsp;tree of life from all sides. This is why the warning had to be&nbsp;issued only concerning the tree of knowledge. As long as&nbsp;man had not eaten from that tree, the tree beyond had not&nbsp;even been a challenge. It was only after they had become&nbsp;aware of the difference between good and evil that eating&nbsp;from the tree of life had become of special interest. Anyone&nbsp;who is immortal by definition was not interested in eating&nbsp;from a tree of life which promised no more than what he&nbsp;already possessed. Seeing that the concept of sinning, i.e.&nbsp;deliberately disobeying G’d’s instruction, came into existence&nbsp;only after he had eaten from the tree of knowledge, the most&nbsp;that could have happened would have been that he had&nbsp;inadvertently eaten from the fruit of the tree of life, something&nbsp;that hardly qualified for a penalty. After having eaten from the&nbsp;tree of knowledge, eating from the tree of life became a&nbsp;deliberate sin, and would bring in its wake the appropriate&nbsp;punishment. It was therefore preferable for man to have&nbsp;eaten from the tree of knowledge to his having eaten from&nbsp;the tree of life, as the penalty for eating from the latter would&nbsp;have been harsher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ביום אכלך ממנו מות תמות</span><span class="font5">, “for on the day you</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">would eat from it you would surely become mortal.” Man had not been created as a mortal body, but after having sinned&nbsp;he was punished by becoming mortal. G’d’s warning did not&nbsp;mean that he would die immediately. He only had warned&nbsp;him that he would lose his entitlement to infinite life. At some&nbsp;time in the future he would not be able to escape the need to&nbsp;die. This is why he had to be separated from proximity to the&nbsp;tree of life, so that he could not regain the immortality that he&nbsp;had now lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא טוב היות האדם לבדו</span><span class="font5">, “it is not good for Adam to&nbsp;remain solitary;” this was not a new idea that G’d had; He&nbsp;had planned for it all the time; He did not want to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">impose</span><span class="font5"> a&nbsp;partner on Adam, and that is why He gave him a chance to&nbsp;name the animals and to find that all of them had suitable&nbsp;mates, something that he now felt he lacked. G’d therefore&nbsp;responded to a wish of Adam that he had not even voiced as&nbsp;yet. If the mate was provided in response to his longing he&nbsp;would appreciate his wife more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.19. וייצר ה' אלוקים, “</span><span class="font5">The Lord G’d fashioned, etc.” In one verse we have read that G’d created the birds from the&nbsp;water (1,21), here it states that the birds were the product&nbsp;that G’d fashioned from the earth. How are we to understand&nbsp;this? We have to consider that some birds make their habitat&nbsp;in water, (geese, ducks, swans) and whereas others are&nbsp;unable to survive in water, for instance, chicken and turkeys,&nbsp;to name only a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבא אל האדם</span><span class="font5">, “He brought to Adam;” G’d did not bring the fish as they are water bound and cannot survive on dry land.&nbsp;As a result of this, man does not enjoy authority over the fish.&nbsp;He did not bring domesticated mammals to him either, as&nbsp;Adam was already familiar with them. G’d did not have to&nbsp;bring them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לראות מה יקרא לו, </span><span class="font5">“to find out how he would name it;” (the species). G’d wanted to find out how Adam reacted to the&nbsp;living soul He had blown into his nostrils i.e. if he would be&nbsp;able to correctly name the various species that fitted their&nbsp;nature. This is what is meant when the Torah wrote: הוא שמו&nbsp;“which is its appropriate name.” [The name G’d would have&nbsp;given these creatures if Adam had not named them. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'וכל אשר יקרא לו וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and whatever name Adam would give that species, etc.” The reason that Adam named each&nbsp;species was so that whenever he needed one of them he&nbsp;knew how to call for it, i.e. by its name. If G’d Himself had&nbsp;named each species and Adam would have had to ask Him&nbsp;for its name, it would have been a cumbersome procedure.&nbsp;This way he himself remembered the name of each species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,20. ולאדם לא מצא עזר</span><span class="font5">, “but Adam had not found a suitable partner for himself;” why did G’d not create Chavah&nbsp;at the same time as He had created Adam? G’d had known&nbsp;that the time would come when her husband would blame&nbsp;her for his own sin. (3,12) This is why He delayed creating&nbsp;her until Adam had expressed a wish for her explicitly.&nbsp;(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 17,4) As soon as Adam had&nbsp;expressed his wish for a suitable partner, G’d put him to&nbsp;sleep and proceeded to fashion Chavah from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כנגדו, from raw material which matched that which had had been made of both in substance and in appearance.&nbsp;(See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum Yerushalmi).</span><span class="font5"> This is why when the mammals&nbsp;had been paraded before him, the Torah had written that he&nbsp;had not found עזר כנגדו “a mate that would </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">match </span><span class="font5">him.” He&nbsp;had found numerous animals that could have served him as&nbsp;helpers for one purpose or another, but none that would have&nbsp;been suitable all round.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,21.ויפל תרדמה על האדם</span><span class="font5">, according to the plain meaning of the text, the meaning of this phrase is that “G’d cast a&nbsp;deep sleep over Adam;” this was so that the surgery He&nbsp;performed on him should not cause him any pain. He made&nbsp;him unconscious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישן ויקח אחת מצלעותיו</span><span class="font5">, “and while he was asleep, He took one of his ribs;” Samuel, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Breshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 17,6 says that&nbsp;He took one rib from between other ribs, and that this&nbsp;justifies the word תחתנה, which is in the plural mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויסגר בשר תחתנה</span><span class="font5">, “He closed up that spot with flesh.” The Torah did not write: תחתה which would have meant that He&nbsp;replaced the area of the incision with flesh instead;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויסגור בשר</span><span class="font5">; until the creation of woman the letter ס had not appeared in the Torah; this is to teach us that Satan had&nbsp;not found an entrance into the world until woman had been&nbsp;created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: the appearance of the letter ס is to remind us that a wife is always close to her husband.&nbsp;Concerning the query raised in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> that the&nbsp;letter ס had already appeared in the word: הסובב in verse 11&nbsp;of our chapter, we must answer that the subjects in that&nbsp;verse are two rivers, not a human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בשר תחתנה</span><span class="font5">, a reference to the flesh of man’s buttocks. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 17,6.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,22. ויביאה אל האדם; </span><span class="font5">“He brought her to Adam.” Where did He bring her from? After all she had been part of her&nbsp;husband’s ribs before, i.e. right next to him? The Torah here&nbsp;describes how her sudden appearance next to him was&nbsp;viewed by Adam when he awoke from his deep sleep. He&nbsp;thought that G’d had brought her to him, just as He had&nbsp;brought the animals to him to be named. It was only after he&nbsp;noticed that now one of his ribs was missing, that he realised&nbsp;that she had formerly been part of his own flesh; this is why&nbsp;he exclaimed: “bone from my own bones, etc.” If we were to&nbsp;look for a similar formulation in the Holy Scriptures, we can&nbsp;find it in Joshua 2,7: והאנשים רדפו אחריהם, “and the men had&nbsp;chased after them” (the spies). Actually, they were only&nbsp;under the impression that they pursued them, as they never&nbsp;found them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators claim that our verse means that Adam thought that G’d had performed the operation beyond&nbsp;the borders of the garden, and this is why the Torah wrote:&nbsp;“He brought her to Adam.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22</span><span class="font5">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זאת הפעם</span><span class="font5">, “this time;” he meant that this time the male’s partner was made of his own flesh. But he realised&nbsp;that this was a one time occurrence and would not repeat&nbsp;itself. Henceforth, instead of woman emanating from man,&nbsp;man would emanate from woman. (her womb).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זאת הפעם עצם מעצמי</span><span class="font5">; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> claims that Adam had already attempted carnal relations with each female of the species&nbsp;and had found such mating unsatisfactory. (The source&nbsp;appears to be the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> 63, as well as Rabbi&nbsp;Saadyah, gaon) We would have to assume that each of&nbsp;these species had become pregnant from such relations&nbsp;before Adam had had relations with them. If we were not to&nbsp;assume this they would have become sterile after mating&nbsp;with a human being. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avodah Zarah,22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">עצם מעצמי, “bone from my bone;” Adam realised that this new creature was basically different from all the others that&nbsp;he had become familiar with, so that he concluded it could&nbsp;only be due to the fact that she shared the same raw material&nbsp;with him. The reason why G’d may have arranged this so&nbsp;was in order for the human being to be encouraged to set up&nbsp;a home only with its own species when leaving their parents’&nbsp;home. This would encourage them in the words of the Torah:&nbsp;והיו לבשר אחד “to become one flesh.” (a body composed of&nbsp;uniform human raw material) None of the other creatures&nbsp;pursue females in order to set up “house” with them. The&nbsp;reason is that they do not miss the “missing rib” which G’d&nbsp;had taken from Adam and had given it to his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לזאת יקרא אשה</span><span class="font5">, “this person must be called “אשה,” as it had been taken from “איש.” Compare the words: נער and נערה,&nbsp;for “boy” and “girl,” and ילד and ילדה. The author was troubled&nbsp;why the Torah uses the expression: נערה בתולה, instead of&nbsp;אשה בתולה, for an adult virgin</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי מאיש לקחה</span><span class="font5">, “for she emanated from the human species.” He meant that the female of the human species is&nbsp;reserved for a single male partner, as distinct from the&nbsp;beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that the females of the various animals did not originate from their male counterparts, the names they are&nbsp;known by reflect this. Example: תישים for male goats, as&nbsp;opposed to עזים, for the female of the species. [What about פר&nbsp;and פרה, for the male and the female of the species&nbsp;respectively? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Torah writes in verse 24: ודבק באשתו, that there is a special bond between man and his wife, Rabbi&nbsp;Akiva in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> 17, explains this as follows: when a man and&nbsp;his wife are loyal to one another, forsaking the temptation to&nbsp;commit adultery, G’d Himself will be a constant companion of&nbsp;them, seeing that each of them has a letter of His name in&nbsp;their respective names, i.e. the letter י in the word איש, and&nbsp;the letter ה in the word אשה. If they conduct themselves in an&nbsp;unworthy manner, giving in to the temptation to engage in&nbsp;forbidden carnal relationships, G’d withdraws from them&nbsp;leaving only the letters אש, “fire,” burning lust, in their&nbsp;respective names. This fire will consume them. This “fire” will&nbsp;burn more fiercely in woman than in man, so that she will&nbsp;experience its destructive effect sooner than her erstwhile&nbsp;loyal partner, as the letter of G’d’s name was only a suffix in&nbsp;the word אשה, where in the name איש it is central to that&nbsp;word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,24.והיו לבשר אחד</span><span class="font5">, “they will each have marital relations only with their legal partner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,1. והנחש היה ערום</span><span class="font5">, we must assume that the serpent per chance had already eaten from the tree of knowledge, as the&nbsp;warning not to eat from it was issued not only to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמר אל האשה</span><span class="font5">, “it said to the woman;” G’d had given the serpent the power of speech, just as He had given that&nbsp;power to Bileam’s ass (Numbers 22,28).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אף כי אמר אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “even though G’d has said, etc.;” the word אף implies that the serpent was aware that only eating&nbsp;had been forbidden not touching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,3. ולא תגעו</span><span class="font5">, neither must you touch it. This is the plain&nbsp;meaning of the verse. We find that the Torah does forbid&nbsp;something that is forbidden to eat, i.e. a carcass that did not&nbsp;die through ritual slaughter. (Compare Leviticus 11,8, where&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachic</span><span class="font5"> meaning is that it must not be touched when the&nbsp;purpose is to eat it.) The truth is that when one adds a&nbsp;restriction to G’d’s commandment, instead of improving it,&nbsp;one causes harm to it, makes it less effective instead of more&nbsp;effective. Seeing that the additional restriction had not been&nbsp;issued by G’d directly, it is less than useless. (Compare&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin 29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא מות תמותון</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this expression&nbsp;means that the serpent had first pushed the woman against&nbsp;the tree to demonstrate that though she had touched it, she&nbsp;had not died. Neither would she die by eating from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask how did the serpent know that the woman would not die by touching that tree? G’d had&nbsp;threatened that anyone eating from that tree would die on&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">day, and the day had not come to an end yet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must not ask such questions when examining the exegesis of our sages! Actually, this question has been&nbsp;asked, and answered as the serpent having convinced the&nbsp;woman that death would follow instantaneously if she would&nbsp;violate G’d’s commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to answer the doubters or deniers of the truth of the Torah, this dialogue was not completed until the next&nbsp;morning when the previous day had already passed without&nbsp;any harm befalling the woman. [Some commentators claim&nbsp;that the serpent had eaten herself and demonstrated that she&nbsp;had not suffered any harm. In that case we must assume that&nbsp;the animals had </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">been forbidden to eat from that tree.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the words: לא מות תמותון: the serpent told the woman that she now risked nothing by&nbsp;eating, as if she had said that also touching had been&nbsp;forbidden, she could not die more than once anyways, so&nbsp;what did she have to lose by also tasting the fruit of that&nbsp;tree? The literal meaning of the words: לא מות תמותון, would&nbsp;therefore be: “you cannot die twice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והייתם כאלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “and you will wind up being just like&nbsp;G’d;” the word as used by the serpent means: “like angels.”&nbsp;We have confirmation for this from the translation of Onkelos,&nbsp;i.e. כרברמין חכמין, “of superior intelligence;” (according to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Maimonides in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">moreh nevuchim,</span><span class="font5"> this is not the only time that the word; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font5"> is used to describe angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.6.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותרא האשה, “the woman saw,” with her mental eye;&nbsp;as in Kohelet 1,17 ולבי ראה הרבה חכמה, “and with my heart I&nbsp;saw a great deal of wisdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis of these words: the verse must be rephrased as: “the woman took from the fruit and ate; as a&nbsp;result she realised that the tree (its fruit) was good to eat,&nbsp;and she also gave to her husband to share it and he ate.”&nbsp;[The problem was that one can taste that something is good,&nbsp;but one cannot know by looking at it that something tastes&nbsp;good. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גם לאישה, </span><span class="font5">“also to her husband;” this included her twins who had already been born by that time, as we have been&nbsp;taught in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin 38.</span><span class="font5"> [The Talmud there describes that no&nbsp;more than an hour elapsed between Adam and Chavah&nbsp;mating and Kayin and Hevel, their twins having being born,&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותאכל</span><span class="font5">, “she was the first one to eat;” she had assumed eating had not been included in the prohibition. According to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> she reasoned that if she had to die G’d would surely&nbsp;provide Adam with another wife. In order to forestall this, she&nbsp;gave her husband to eat so that they would both die.&nbsp;Alternately, they would both continue to live. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi</span><span class="font5"> may&nbsp;have used the word: לאשה, “to her husband,” instead of “to&nbsp;Adam,” as the inspiration for this insight.) Moreover, she&nbsp;thought that by her survival her husband would be able to&nbsp;fulfill G’d’s commandment to become fruitful and to multiply&nbsp;by means of her surviving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותפקחנה עיני שניהם </span><span class="font5">“and the eyes of both of them&nbsp;were opened;” had they then been blind before? The&nbsp;meaning of the expression is that only now did they realise&nbsp;how many generations each of them had lost through eating&nbsp;from the fruit of the tree of knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וידעו</span><span class="font5">, they recognised that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ערומים הם</span><span class="font5">, that their being nude was something they have to be ashamed of. The word עירומים is sometimes&nbsp;spelled with the letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">י </span><span class="font5">after the letter ע and sometimes not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The author offers no reason for why it is sometimes one way and sometimes another. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Minchas shay,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;text in our author’s manuscript should read that when spelled&nbsp;with the letter י after the letter ע, the word as both meanings,&nbsp;i.e. “naked” as well as “crafty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויתפרו עלה תאנה</span><span class="font5">, “they sewed a fig leaf, as a temporary device to cover their private parts. They used this as a device&nbsp;to atone for their sin, by making it into some type of loincloth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find the expression לחגור, as describing a device to prevent a garment from falling, in connection with David in&nbsp;Samuel II 6,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,8. מתהלך בגן</span><span class="font5">, “the sound of G’d’s voice appeared to take a walk in the garden” This expression describing the&nbsp;movement of sound, occurs elsewhere also. Examples are:&nbsp;Exodus 19,19, קול השופר הולך, “as the sound of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">became progressively stronger;” it also occurs in Jeremiah&nbsp;46,22, קולה כנחש ילך, “she rustles like a snake.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לרוח היום</span><span class="font5">, as if accompanying the prevailing wind; it did not cause the wind to blow harder so as not to give Adam the&nbsp;excuse that he had to hide in order to escape the force of the&nbsp;wind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of this expression: Adam and his wife had been sitting in a position where they could take&nbsp;advantage of the cooling effect of that wind. As soon as they&nbsp;heard G’d’s voice, they fled from their position to escape&nbsp;G’d’s voice. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this was a westerly wind.&nbsp;This sounds logical as the seat of G’d’s Presence is always&nbsp;perceived as being in the West. [not the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on our verse;&nbsp;perhaps the author refers to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on Song of Songs 4,6.&nbsp;In the Temple the holiest section was at its western end. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,10. כי עירום אנכי</span><span class="font5">, because I am nude;” although they wore the fig leaf. Perhaps that leaf only covered their private&nbsp;parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,12. האשה אשר נתתה עמדי</span><span class="font5">, “the woman You have given me to be my companion;” Adam complains that this woman&nbsp;who had been meant to be his helper, assistant, had instead&nbsp;turned out to be his seducer. He had assumed that he could&nbsp;trust her implicitly. He claimed that he had not known from&nbsp;which tree she had taken the fruit she offered him. The Torah&nbsp;had not mentioned which fruit she had asked him to share,&nbsp;i.e. the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Adam implied that if he&nbsp;had known that this was the fruit of the tree of knowledge he&nbsp;would not have eaten from it. Had he refused her offer of the&nbsp;fruit, he would have appeared as ungrateful, for how could he&nbsp;refuse something that G’d had provided, seeing that only&nbsp;good things emanate from G’d. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avodah Zarah,</span><span class="font5"> 5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,12. ויאמר ה' אלוקים לאשה</span><span class="font5">, “The Lord G’d said to the woman: where was Adam? Abba Chalfi ben Karchi said that&nbsp;after having engaged in marital relations with his wife he was&nbsp;tired and had gone to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,14</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי עשית זאת, </span><span class="font5">(G’d speaking to the serpent) “because this is what you have done, etc;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments&nbsp;that we learn from here that seducers are not given an&nbsp;opportunity to defend their actions, as if G’d had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">asked</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;serpent why it had acted as it did, the serpent would have&nbsp;answered: ”since when does one follow the instructions of&nbsp;the pupil when they contradict the instructions of the teacher,&nbsp;i.e. G’d?” Since the Torah had expressly forbidden the&nbsp;seducer to practice his trade, this will never be accepted as&nbsp;his excuse, i.e. that he only wanted to “test” the victim of his&nbsp;seduction. If the seducer himself does not use this argument,&nbsp;we (the court) certainly must not use it on his behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask: the Torah’s legislation about this subject only deals with someone who seduces others to&nbsp;commit </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">idolatry</span><span class="font5">, not other sins!? (Compare Deuteronomy&nbsp;13,7-12) The answer is that the serpent had held out the&nbsp;hope to the woman that by eating from the tree of knowledge&nbsp;they would be just as great as G’d, והייתם כאלוהים, i.e. the&nbsp;seduction was based on </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">leading</span><span class="font5"> them into worshipping&nbsp;themselves as deities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארור אתה</span><span class="font5">, “you are cursed;” G’d began the series of curses, in the same sequence as the seduction had begun,&nbsp;i.e. the serpent was punished first. The woman was punished&nbsp;next, and Adam was punished last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מכל הבהמה ומכל חית השדה</span><span class="font5">, “more than any mammal or beast of the field;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> asks the rhetorical question: “if G’d&nbsp;punished the serpent more than any mammal, is it not&nbsp;understood that it also punished it more than any beast of the&nbsp;field?” The sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bechorot</span><span class="font5"> 8 explain that a female cat&nbsp;gives birth after 52 days of pregnancy, whereas&nbsp;domesticated mammals such as donkeys require 49 weeks,&nbsp;i.e. about seven times as long. The serpent was condemned&nbsp;to a pregnancy of seven years instead. The Torah had only&nbsp;used this opportunity to inform us that the pregnancy of large&nbsp;mammals had already been longer than that of smaller&nbsp;mammals. The duration of a snake’s pregnancy would be so&nbsp;much longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[This editor may be forgiven when he fails to understand that snakes which do not produce live young, but lay eggs,&nbsp;like birds, “suffer” pregnancy pains at all. I have found in&nbsp;Google that there are some snakes which reside in cool&nbsp;climates that do produce live young. This still does not mean&nbsp;that they have carried them for seven years? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: seeing that there is no other beast that is forced to crawl on its belly, not even having many&nbsp;short legs, it is quite obvious that the snake, in order to&nbsp;secure its food, labours under greater difficulties than any&nbsp;other type of living creature. Besides, the manner in which a&nbsp;snake has to eat the grass of the field makes it impossible&nbsp;that its mouth does not also swallow some of the earth that&nbsp;the grass grew out of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועפר תאכל</span><span class="font5">, “and you will be forced to eat dust.” The reference is to virgin earth. The meaning of the whole verse&nbsp;is: ”as long as you live you will search for virgin earth from&nbsp;which to secure your food; this is the penalty that has been&nbsp;decreed for you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על גחונך תלך</span><span class="font5">, “you will have to move by using your belly.” This part of the penalty would commence forthwith and would&nbsp;continue indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,15. ואיבה אשית</span><span class="font5">, “and I will set enmity, etc.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s </span><span class="font5">comment, printed in our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chumashim</span><span class="font5"> as belonging to this&nbsp;verse, although appearing at the end of G’d’s speaking to the&nbsp;serpent, refers to the original intention of the serpent to&nbsp;cause Adam’s death as a result from eating of the fruit of the&nbsp;tree of knowledge; the reason it had not tried to seduce&nbsp;Adam, G’d was well aware of, was that it is easier to deceive&nbsp;women, so that the woman was used as the serpent’s tool in&nbsp;seducing Adam. The Torah adds this line in order to show&nbsp;how much the punishment fitted the crime, the ultimate&nbsp;objective of the serpent having been (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">source </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit Rabbah,20,5</span><span class="font5"> ) that it would marry the&nbsp;woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא ישופך ראש</span><span class="font5">, “he will strike your head,” seeing that you are crawling on the ground,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואתה תשופנו עקב</span><span class="font5">, “whereas you will only be able to attack the heel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,16. אל האשה אמר</span><span class="font5">, “to the woman He had said:” the gentiles asked Rabbi Joshua why the woman was punished&nbsp;for eating from a tree, seeing that she had not even been&nbsp;created yet when G’d issued the prohibition to eat from it to&nbsp;Adam. He replied that the Torah did not write that G’d&nbsp;forbade eating from the tree “to” Adam, but that it worded it&nbsp;as a general prohibition including the human species, by&nbsp;writing: על האדם, “concerning all his limbs and sinews,” or “the&nbsp;human species,” i.e. himself and all his offspring. (Compare&nbsp;2,16) Woman, after all, had been constructed from what had&nbsp;been part of his body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: the woman had included herself in the prohibition when she had told the serpent that G’d had&nbsp;forbidden, quoting Him in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">plural</span><span class="font5"> mode: לא תאכלו ממנו, “you&nbsp;(pl) must not eat from it.” (3,4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הרבה ארבה</span><span class="font5">, “you will be in a state of retardation, held back throughout your life.” You will always be in a position of&nbsp;trying to catch up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask that she could console herself by arguing that she would assign her household duties to her&nbsp;paid servants, G’d added that there were duties, such as her&nbsp;carrying a fetus in her womb which she could not outsource,&nbsp;i.e. הרונך, your pregnancy and the pain associated with her&nbsp;giving birth; if she were to respond that she would forego&nbsp;having marital relations with her husband, G’d added that it&nbsp;would become her second nature to long for the physical&nbsp;union with her husband, ואל אישך תשוקתך. If she would&nbsp;respond that she would learn to control such urges, G’d&nbsp;added that והוא ימשול בך, “he would exercise control over her.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא ימשול בך</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> [as understood by our author, Ed.] the meaning of this phrase is that her husband&nbsp;will be the driving force in all matters of marital union, and&nbsp;that seeing you do not experience the desire for such&nbsp;physical intercourse, unless he has been aroused, you will&nbsp;not be able to arouse him, but on the other hand, he can&nbsp;force marital union on you;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our sages state in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 20,18, “you might have thought from this phrase that her husband dominates&nbsp;her in every respect;” to prevent you from thinking thus, the&nbsp;Torah in Deuteronomy 24,6 wrote: לא יחבול רחים ורכב, “he&nbsp;must not inflict injury upon her by overburdening her.” [It is&nbsp;clear that the Torah there refers to the woman, as in the&nbsp;previous verse it had ordered the husband to provide his new&nbsp;bride with joy for the first year of the marriage. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, that verse has been translated by the Jerusalem Talmud as meaning: “you must not take the upper&nbsp;millstone as pawn for overdue debts, as the livelihood of the&nbsp;debtor depends upon it.” Our author accepts a different&nbsp;exegesis which understands the verse to mean that a man&nbsp;who has become engaged to a woman, must not allow&nbsp;undue delay before the actual marriage, as his “bride” would&nbsp;then be considered as if her groom had abandoned her. [The&nbsp;word כי יקח in the previous verse refers to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">engagement </span><span class="font5">not&nbsp;actual consummation, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,17. ולאדם</span><span class="font5">, Rabbi Yehudah, son of Rabbi Shimon points out that the word for G’d appears a total of 71 times&nbsp;before this word. This is an allusion to the number of judges&nbsp;that comprise the Jewish Supreme Court, known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin.</span><span class="font5"> The verse is a hint that G’d convened the&nbsp;Supreme Court in the celestial regions to decree the death&nbsp;penalty on Adam. If, after making your own count you found&nbsp;that G’d’s name had already appeared 73 times, you must&nbsp;remember that in the expression: בצלם אלוהים or in והייתם&nbsp;כאלוהים, the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">”elohim,</span><span class="font5"> is not sacred, as it does not mean&nbsp;“G’d,” but “angel.” Our author had drawn attention to this&nbsp;already in his commentary of Genesis 1,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולאדם אמר</span><span class="font5">, ”and to Adam He had said:” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah, </span><span class="font5">20,3 in commenting on the words: “and He had said to Man,”&nbsp;writes that of all creatures only three perform sexual union&nbsp;while facing one another’s face; they are: the human beings,&nbsp;the snake and the fish. They enjoy this distinction because in&nbsp;the Holy Scriptures we read that each of these species had&nbsp;been spoken to by G’d, directly. Man had been addressed by&nbsp;G’d in our chapter. The snake had been addressed by G’d&nbsp;also in our chapter. The fish that had swallowed and spat out</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jonah had also been addressed by G’d directly, as we read in Jonah: 2,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי שמעת לקול אשתך, </span><span class="font5">“because you (preferred) to listen to the voice of your wife, etc.;” instead of to My voice. She had&nbsp;revealed the secret to you that the serpent had revealed to&nbsp;her, you cannot claim to have been ignorant, and that is why&nbsp;you have to be punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארורה האדמה</span><span class="font5">, “the soil has become cursed;” the earth had been guilty on its own account, as G’d had commanded it in&nbsp;Genesis 1,11: תדשא הארץ עץ פרי עושה פרי, “to produce edible&nbsp;trees bearing edible fruit;” however the earth had failed to&nbsp;produce edible trees (compare 1,12) The curse on the earth&nbsp;lasted only as long as Adam would live on it, i.e. כל ימי חייך,&nbsp;“as long as you are alive.” If you will make a careful count,&nbsp;you will find that from the day Adam died until Noach was&nbsp;born, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no one </span><span class="font5">had been born, and with Noach’s birth the&nbsp;original blessing returned to the earth. Noach’s father,&nbsp;Lemech, was aware of this, this is why he exclaimed at the&nbsp;birth of his son (Genesis,29) זה ינחמנו ממעשי ידינו ומעצבון ידינו מן&nbsp;האדמה אשר אררה ה'. “this one is destined to comfort us for the&nbsp;hard work we had to do and the disappointments we have&nbsp;experienced as the result of G’d having cursed the soil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah, after the deluge, testifies that Noach became an outstanding farmer, איש האדמה, who also planted a&nbsp;vineyard. (Genesis 9,20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעבורך</span><span class="font5">, not “on account of you,” but “relative to your harvest.” We find the word עבור meaning: “harvest,” in Joshua&nbsp;5,11, where the Israelites are described as for the first time&nbsp;eating from the produce of the Holy Land (instead of manna).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah had told us that subsequent to the earth’s having been cursed it would (not exclusively) produce thorns&nbsp;and thistles although it had been sowed with perfectly good&nbsp;seeds. (3,18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל ימי חייך</span><span class="font5">, “all the days of your life.” If you were to ask that if the earth only produced thorns and thistles how was&nbsp;Adam able to live on it for 930 years as testified by the&nbsp;Torah? (Genesis 5,5) Besides, had the Torah not warned&nbsp;him that he would die on the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">day </span><span class="font5">he ate from the tree of&nbsp;knowledge? He was allowed to continue living for a while as&nbsp;part of his excuse had been perfectly logical, namely his&nbsp;argument that he had thought that G’d had given him a wife&nbsp;only for his benefit not as someone who would seduce him&nbsp;into sinning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;קוץ ודרדר תצמיח לך</span><span class="font5">, “it will grow thorns and thistles&nbsp;for you.” Until this moment the decree of Genesis 1,26&nbsp;according to which the human species would rule in an&nbsp;unrestricted manner over all the creatures on earth had been&nbsp;in effect. There had been no need to guard the garden&nbsp;against invasion of wild beasts. From this moment on the&nbsp;negative phenomena on earth would be in effect, but would&nbsp;be directed only against the human species, לך, “against&nbsp;you.” The animal kingdom would not experience thorns and&nbsp;thistles as an impediment of their life on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בזיעת אפיך</span><span class="font5">, “in the sweat of your face; etc.;” the&nbsp;word אף in this verse refers to the protrusion called “nose,”&nbsp;which is the first organ beginning to perspire when one&nbsp;engages in physically strenuous activity. This particular curse&nbsp;affects only farmers, people working the soil. The second&nbsp;curse, that of enduring pain and hardship during the process&nbsp;of giving birth, affects only women. This was because&nbsp;Chavah had not only sinned but had also caused others, i.e.&nbsp;her husband, to sin. As a result she had been cursed more&nbsp;severely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד שובך אל האדמה</span><span class="font5">, “until you return to the soil.” As soon as man had died the decree cursing the earth became null&nbsp;and void, as we explained. (verse 17) [Our author appears&nbsp;anxious to counter the Christian doctrine that all of mankind,&nbsp;forever suffers from the consequences of Adam and&nbsp;Chavah’s sin, especially woman which is considered as&nbsp;having brought hereditary sin into the world. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.20. חוה</span><span class="font5">, a variant of the word חיות, “life.” It is a derivative of the root: .הוה היה</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אם כל חיה</span><span class="font5">, “mother of all living human beings.” According to Rabbi Simmon, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 20,11, what is meant is&nbsp;the “mother of all living creatures.” According to his view&nbsp;during all the 130 years that Adam lived apart from his wife,&nbsp;male disembodied spirits used her body warmth to produce&nbsp;living creatures that emanated from her womb. Female spirits&nbsp;also used her body as the means to reproduce. Our author&nbsp;directs the reader to a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> on Samuel II 7,14 where the&nbsp;words: והוכחתיו בשבט אנשים ובנגעי בני אדם, “I will chastise him&nbsp;with the rod of men and the affliction of mortals,” are&nbsp;explained in the manner he had described. The 130 years of&nbsp;which the Torah speaks are explained in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eyruvin&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: the words אם כל חי, are a compliment to Chavah who is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">human mother of the&nbsp;human species. Devorah refers to herself in similar terms at&nbsp;the beginning of her famous song thanking G’d for her and&nbsp;Barak’s victory in Judges 5,7, where she refers to herself as&nbsp;“the mother of Israel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כתנות עור</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> “tunics made of&nbsp;skin/leather.” This “leather” was smooth as nails, no hair ever&nbsp;having been on it. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> contradicts commentators who&nbsp;explained the term as referring to the skins of hares which&nbsp;are completely covered with hair. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">20,20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כתנות עור</span><span class="font5">, the term כתונת is familiar to us from the outer garment made for Joseph by his father, and the linen tunic&nbsp;worn by the High Priest, was intended to cover their bodies&nbsp;and their flesh, as described in Job 5,5, the extremities of&nbsp;their bodies, as opposed to the torso. The point is that the&nbsp;material was not taken from the body of a large mammal that&nbsp;had died, as there had not been time as yet for such skin to&nbsp;have been stretched to make it into leather. Compare&nbsp;Onkelos. According to some opinions the material stemmed&nbsp;from the Leviathan, the female of which G’d had killed and&nbsp;whose meat had been salted away by G’d for use to serve to&nbsp;the righteous in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וילבישם</span><span class="font5">, “He dressed them.” First Adam and Chavah had made some kind of aprons that could be tied around their&nbsp;loins.(3,7) Now their entire bodies were covered by these&nbsp;tunics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועתה פן ישלח ידו</span><span class="font5">, “and now, lest he stretch out his&nbsp;hand;” this is an abbreviated verse, [reflecting the urgency of&nbsp;the matter? Ed.] The word: ועתה, could have been omitted as&nbsp;it is well known that הכל בידי שמים חוץ מיראת שמים, “everything&nbsp;is subject to control by heaven except matters that depend&nbsp;on one’s degree of awe for heaven.” G’d did not therefore&nbsp;have to “fear” what Adam was about to do, but He knew it&nbsp;beforehand. G’d was perfectly capable to prevent Adam from&nbsp;eating of the tree while he was in the garden. It was His&nbsp;domain also, and He could have denied him access without&nbsp;having to expel him. Why then did the Torah bother to begin&nbsp;our verse with the word: ועתה, “and now?” It was inserted as&nbsp;the attribute of Justice urged G’d to test man’s ability to resist&nbsp;his temptation. G’d was certain that, especially </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font5">, Adam&nbsp;would not be able to resist that temptation, therefore G’d put&nbsp;him beyond such temptation. This was going beyond the&nbsp;demands of justice, an act of Mercy by G’d. It gave Adam an&nbsp;opportunity to claim that even if he had remained within the&nbsp;garden he would have resisted the temptation to eat from the&nbsp;tree of Life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולקח גם מעץ החיים</span><span class="font5">, “and he will also take from the fruit of the tree of Life.” One reason that would have caused him to&nbsp;eat from that tree is that he had not even been warned not to&nbsp;eat from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At any rate, after Adam had already sinned once by eating from the tree of knowledge, there was reason to&nbsp;assume that to breach the restrictions once more, especially&nbsp;if the objective was to repair the damage he had caused&nbsp;himself by eating from the tree of knowledge was not far&nbsp;fetched, and G’d took that into consideration by physically&nbsp;preventing him from carrying out such an intention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואכל וחי לעולם</span><span class="font5">, “he will eat and live forever.” If you were to remind us that the Torah had previously written that as a&nbsp;result of, or even on the day of eating from the tree of&nbsp;knowledge man would die, what good would it do him to eat&nbsp;from the tree of Life? We are forced to assume that the tree&nbsp;of Life, i.e. its fruit, was a medication intended to heal people&nbsp;that had been afflicted with a fatal disease. Anyone not so&nbsp;inflicted would not feel the urge to eat from it; -[for all we&nbsp;know its fruit did not even look inviting. Ed.] Perhaps the&nbsp;translation of the expression: מות תמות, especially the&nbsp;repetition of the word for “death”: means that after having&nbsp;eaten from the fruit of the tree of knowledge man would be&nbsp;considered as if already legally dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: G’d said that seeing death had already been decreed for man, and He had decreed that&nbsp;anyone eating from the tree of Life would live forever, how&nbsp;could both decrees exist side by side except by denying&nbsp;those who had eaten from the tree of knowledge access to&nbsp;the tree of Life?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third possible exegesis: if Adam and Chavah would give birth to children while still in the garden, and these had&nbsp;not eaten from the fruit of the tree of knowledge, it would be&nbsp;unfair to decree death for them; and if they were to eat from&nbsp;the tree of Life they would live forever. Therefore they had to&nbsp;be denied access.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Seeing that G’d did </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">consider uprooting the tree of Life, it is proof that anything in this universe which dies out,&nbsp;or perishes, does not do so as an act of G’d Who had&nbsp;created it for the benefit of His creatures, but must be a result&nbsp;of those creatures having forfeited by their actions the good&nbsp;such a phenomenon could do for them. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישלחהו מגן עדן</span><span class="font5">, “He expelled them from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gan Eden”.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">He was punished in a manner similar to that of a person&nbsp;killing another person through neglect rather than with intent&nbsp;to kill, i.e. he is exiled to a city of refuge. [the whole earth&nbsp;other than </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gan Eden</span><span class="font5"> in this instance. Ed.] The reason why&nbsp;this penalty was appropriate was that at the moment when&nbsp;Chavah and Adam had eaten from the tree of knowledge&nbsp;they had not yet possessed the knowledge of good and evil&nbsp;which would have made them deliberate sinners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויגרש את האדם; </span><span class="font5">“as soon as He had expelled Adam,&nbsp;etc.;” this verse does not mean to tell us that G’d had&nbsp;expelled Adam and his family, as we have already been told&nbsp;this in the previous verse. We have to understand this verse&nbsp;as follows: “as soon as G’d had expelled Adam and his wife,&nbsp;G’d positioned angels at the entrance to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gan Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הכרובים </span><span class="font5">“the cherubs;” who were these cherubs? They were creatures whose very appearance frightened all those&nbsp;who merely looked at them. They carried gleaming swords in&nbsp;their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">המתהפכת</span><span class="font5">, “these swords exuded flashes of lightning from either side of the blade.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,1. 'קניתי איש את ה</span><span class="font5">, “I have acquired a man with the Lord.” Chavah considered herself as having become a&nbsp;partner with the Creator. From the beginning of creation until&nbsp;Genesis 2,4, where the תולדות, derivatives of the creation&nbsp;have first been mentioned, the name used for G’d had&nbsp;always been </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim.</span><span class="font5"> This meant that the only attribute that&nbsp;G’d had employed was His attribute of Justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the period that He made various improvements, securing the continued viability of the&nbsp;universe He had created, the Creator has been referred to by&nbsp;both the name </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim,</span><span class="font5"> as well as the tetragram. This means&nbsp;that He was employing both His attribute of Justice as well as&nbsp;His attribute of mercy, רחמים. This suggests that possibly by&nbsp;G’d using these two attributes the universe would be able to&nbsp;survive all challenges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do not use the argument that from the serpent’s referring to Him only as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim,</span><span class="font5"> (3,1 and repeatedly&nbsp;afterwards) this disproves my argument; the serpent’s words&nbsp;are not the Torah’s words, even though they have been&nbsp;quoted in the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The undeniable fact is that commencing with the verse relating that Adam had had marital relations with Chavah and&nbsp;that a human being fathered and mothered only by other&nbsp;human beings appeared on earth, G’d had decided that&nbsp;unless He no longer appeared as the attribute of Justice&nbsp;regularly, the world as we know it had no future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,3. מקץ ימים</span><span class="font5">, “a year after Kayin and Hevel had been born;” this is not the only time that the word: ימים, meaning&nbsp;“year,” appears in the Torah. The reason why this makes&nbsp;sense is that in the course of a year, all its days, the long and&nbsp;the short ones, have appeared once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבא קין מפרי האדמה</span><span class="font5">, “Kayin brought an offering to G’d from the fruit of the earth;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> he had&nbsp;chosen the most inferior of the fruit of the earth. He refers to&nbsp;a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> which says that it was flax seed. The reason why&nbsp;G’d rejected his offering was that he offered something which&nbsp;1) was of no use to him as he had plenty of it; 2) that it was&nbsp;the product of the earth which G’d had cursed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His brother Hevel, as the Torah is at pains to point out, presented G’d with the choicest product he had raised, the&nbsp;best of his animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that these two offerings became the cause of destruction on earth, G’d subsequently forbade the Jewish&nbsp;people to wear garments containing a mixture of linen and&nbsp;wool. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Tanchuma B’reshit,</span><span class="font5"> 9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,4. וישע</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this word here means the same as: ויפן, “He turned (benignly);” it appears in this sense&nbsp;also in Exodus 5,9, where Pharaoh warns the Jewish people&nbsp;not to place their hopes in false prophets (Moses). This is&nbsp;difficult, as in our versions of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> he states there that the&nbsp;meaning is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">the same as here, as the Torah uses the&nbsp;prefix ב there instead of the prefix אל.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,7. הלא אם תיטיב שאת</span><span class="font5">, the word שאת is to be understood as: “gift.” In other words, G’d promises Kayin a reward if he&nbsp;would change his attitude. The word appears in this sense in&nbsp;Genesis 43,34, where Joseph offers his brothers gifts. G’d is&nbsp;telling Kayin that when he will offer Him another offering,&nbsp;based on his changed attitude, it will be gratefully received&nbsp;by Him. On the other hand, if he will not change his attitude,&nbsp;he will find that Satan will constantly try to lead him into&nbsp;committing further sins. The whole sentence is a condensed&nbsp;version of G’d’s message to Kayin. Basically, G’d warns&nbsp;Kayin that words are not enough to rehabilitate himself, but&nbsp;that actions must reflect such words. Such verses, i.e.&nbsp;condensed versions, occur again, for instance in Genesis&nbsp;4,15, כל הורג קין, “anyone daring to kill Kayin,” etc. The&nbsp;second half of the verse has been intentionally omitted as the&nbsp;first half makes its meaning clear. Compare also Samuel II&nbsp;5,8, where David implies a reward for soldiers defeating the&nbsp;Jebusites in possession of the city of Jerusalem. [It was a&nbsp;most dangerous mission, considered as “mission&nbsp;impossible.” Ed.])</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: G’d warned Kayin that if he were able to suppress his plan to kill his brother due to his&nbsp;jealousy, He could find it in His heart to reward him for his sin&nbsp;(of offering a sacrifice consisting of inferior produce). The&nbsp;word שאת being interpreted in the same manner as נושא עון,&nbsp;“downgrading a sin,” (Exodus 34,7). G’d added that if Kayin&nbsp;would not restrain his evil urge he would be punished for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חטאת</span><span class="font5">, “a punishable sin.” We find an example of this in Samuel I 28,10. (King Sha-ul who wished to speak to the&nbsp;spirit of Samuel, reassuring the witch that she would not&nbsp;commit </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> punishable sin by calling him from beyond the&nbsp;grave).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you (Kayin) were to say that Hevel is at liberty to flee and thus escape (Kayin’s) wrath, G’d explains to him that&nbsp;seeing that Hevel is his brother and has brotherly feelings for&nbsp;him, he would never dream, of having to escape to save his&nbsp;life from a murderous brother. [Very novel interpretation of&nbsp;ואליך תשוקתו. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If, on the other hand, you were to argue that Hevel being physically stronger than he, he would not have to fear you,&nbsp;G’d says that he, Kayin, would find means of neutralising&nbsp;Hevel’s physical strength, i.e. ואתה תמשול בו. In the ensuing&nbsp;conversation between the two brothers, Kayin told him that&nbsp;he would play the role of the senior brother, something that&nbsp;Hevel was not willing to accept. As a result of this, Kayin&nbsp;determined to kill him, losing no time to carry out his desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואליך תשוקתו</span><span class="font5">, “according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> the word is from the root שקק, “sin, Satan, who is constantly yearning for you.” (in&nbsp;the negative sense of trying to trip you up.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You might argue that if this is the case, how could G’d punish a person for falling into this trap, G’d answers that He&nbsp;has given man the power to withstand such temptation to&nbsp;commit sins, i.e. ואתה תמשול בו, “but you are able to overrule&nbsp;him. (Satan).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet another exegesis, about the phrase: ואתה תמשול בך: “you, Kayin will outrank your brother in terms of your share in&nbsp;your parents’ inheritance and other privileges accruing to the&nbsp;firstborn.” (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zohar B’reshit,</span><span class="font5"> 36)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a story in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> about what Kayin and Hevel were at odds about. They were discussing how to&nbsp;divide up the earth between them, Hevel wanting all the&nbsp;movable property, and Kayin claiming the soil, as is written in&nbsp;Genesis 4,2 that “Kayin became a farmer whereas Hevel&nbsp;became a shepherd.” Kayin objected to Hevel’s flocks&nbsp;grazing on “his” earth. Hevel claimed that all the clothes&nbsp;Kayin was wearing had been “stolen” from the backs of his&nbsp;sheep. He told Kayin to disrobe, while Kayin told Hevel to&nbsp;vacate his land. This led to an altercation during the course&nbsp;of which Hevel was killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,11. מן האדמה</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi:</span><span class="font5"> “more than the previous curse decreed on earth as a result of Adam’s&nbsp;having eaten from the tree of knowledge when it was&nbsp;punished for failing to have produced trees with edible&nbsp;trunks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the verse is to be understood as “you, Kayin, the farmer, are to have to work an earth cursed&nbsp;additionally when you work it, during this year, as it will not&nbsp;continue to yield its fruit for you in the year to follow; seeing&nbsp;that this is so, from now on you will be wandering on earth&nbsp;without permanent homestead, noting that you are cursed,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר פצתה את פיה לקחת את דמי אחיך</span><span class="font5">, “because it opened its mouth, to accept, (hide) the blood of your brother, cooperating with you in hiding your foul deed.” As long as you&nbsp;and your descendants are living on earth; you will therefore&nbsp;have to find new earth to till, earth whose productivity has not&nbsp;been exhausted from the previous year’s harvest. [Kayin’s&nbsp;male descendants came to an end at the time of the deluge.&nbsp;If Noach’s wife was descended from Kayin, this does not&nbsp;contradict this interpretation, as women did not till the soil.&nbsp;Ed.] We have a verse in Job 15,23, which describes the&nbsp;wicked man as wandering in search of bread without&nbsp;succeeding.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,13. גדול עוני מנשוא</span><span class="font5">, “my sin is too great to bear.” Kayin refers to the punishment decreed as a result of his sin. It is&nbsp;more than he thinks he can bear. Having been expelled from&nbsp;having a permanent home on earth is already enough, in his&nbsp;opinion. We find a similar reaction in Lamentations 4,6 where&nbsp;Jeremiah describes the punishment of the Jewish people in&nbsp;similar terms, i.e. ויגדל עון בת עמי מחטאת סדום, “the guilt (and&nbsp;punishment) of my people exceeded that of the people of&nbsp;Sodom;” according to Ibn Ezra, Samuel I 28,10 is also to be&nbsp;understood in that sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to another exegesis, Kayin’s exclamation is to be understood as a query? “Is my sin really too great to be&nbsp;forgiven? You have already expelled me from my home etc.,&nbsp;and made it impossible for me to plant roots, as the soil will&nbsp;not respond to my labour; my father has been expelled from&nbsp;Gan Eden for his sin, but You have seen fit to let him atone&nbsp;for it. Why do You not give me chance also to atone for my&nbsp;sin?” [Adam is not even on record as admitting having&nbsp;sinned. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה כל מוצאי</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וגו, </span><span class="font5">“and anyone who will encounter&nbsp;me (in my exile will feel free to kill me;”) I will not even be&nbsp;able to atone while in exile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לכן כל הורג קין</span><span class="font5">, “therefore, because Kayin has&nbsp;already been so humbled,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעתים יוקם</span><span class="font5">, according to the plain meaning of the text, the meaning is that anyone who will kill Kayin will be&nbsp;avenged sevenfold for having killed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">שבעתים, an alternate word for שבעה, seven, just as ,ארבעתים in Samuel II 12,6, is an alternate word for ארבע, four.&nbsp;There is no point in reading anything special into this&nbsp;formulation as it is commonplace in Holy Scriptures. Our&nbsp;author proceeds to quote at least a half a dozen additional&nbsp;examples; [anyone interested can look this up in any&nbsp;concordance on the Bible. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישם ה</span><span class="font5">' </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לקין אות</span><span class="font5">, “G’d provided Kayin with a visible sign of identification to warn people not to kill him;” the Torah does&nbsp;not give details of the nature of this sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לבלתי הכות אותו</span><span class="font5">, “not to slay him;” the need for this was because mankind had not yet been warned about the sin of&nbsp;murder; at any rate, the penalty of Kayin remaining an exile&nbsp;was not lifted, ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל מוצאו</span><span class="font5">, this cannot be translated as “</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">everyone” </span><span class="font5">who would come across him,” but means “</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">anyone” </span><span class="font5">who would&nbsp;come across him. The use of the word כל in this sense also&nbsp;occurs in Exodus 22,21, כל אלמנה ויתום, where it does not&nbsp;mean “every widow and orphan,” but “any widow or orphan.”&nbsp;The law legislated there is not restricted to a widow who is&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">also </span><span class="font5">an orphan, but to any widow or orphan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.16</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצא קין מלפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “Kayin left the Presence of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem;”</span><span class="font5"> this formula also appears in Esther 8,15, where&nbsp;Mordechai is described as leaving the Presence of the King.&nbsp;The verse informs us that on account of his exile, Kayin was&nbsp;given a new lease on life, and he accepted G’d’s judgment.&nbsp;He was eventually killed inadvertently after seven&nbsp;generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישב בארץ נוד</span><span class="font5">, “he settled in a land known thereafter as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nod”.</span><span class="font5"> Originally, he had been condemned to be נע ונד תהיה&nbsp;בארץ; our sages derive from this line that if one is condemned&nbsp;to be in exile, this diminishes the original sin one qualifies for&nbsp;by half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אבי יושב אהל ומקנה</span><span class="font5">, “the original nomad living in&nbsp;tents” (instead of caves) as the owner followed his herds to&nbsp;where grazing was available. According to a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> quoted&nbsp;by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Yovol built houses to worship idols in. [This&nbsp;Midrash understands the word: מקנה, not as cattle, but as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mekaneh,</span><span class="font5"> doing something to arouse jealousy, i.e. G’d’s&nbsp;jealousy. Ed.] His brother would then have been the first one&nbsp;to use musical instruments for the purpose of worshipping&nbsp;idols.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושם אחיו יובל, </span><span class="font5">“his brother’s name was Yuval.” From&nbsp;the manner in which the Torah reports their births it is clear&nbsp;that they were twins. If not, his birth would have been&nbsp;introduced with: ותלד עוד, “she gave birth also, etc.” It is&nbsp;customary for shepherds to entertain themselves by playing&nbsp;the flute or a similar musical instrument. Most likely Naamah,&nbsp;Tuval Kayin’s sister, (verse 22) born by Tzilah, was also a&nbsp;twin, as Tzilah is not credited with having given birth twice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וצלה גם היא ילדה</span><span class="font5">, “and Tzilah, she too had given&nbsp;birth.” The reason why the Torah introduces this statement&nbsp;with the word גם “also,” is that Lemech had married her only&nbsp;for her physical attributes. She was not intended by him to&nbsp;bear children. All the birth control devices she used had&nbsp;proved ineffective. There are bodies that are immune to such&nbsp;devices (as ancient man used to delay or prevent&nbsp;pregnancy). [The reader can find more on the subject in the&nbsp;Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Niddah</span><span class="font5"> folio 30. Ed.] The reason why the Torah even&nbsp;mentions the vocations chosen by these people is that due to&nbsp;the earth having been cursed, they needed to find ways other&nbsp;than farming to make a living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר למך לנשיו</span><span class="font5">, “Lemech said to his wives:” from&nbsp;the pleading manner in which the Torah describes his&nbsp;address to his wives, i.e. שמען קולי,....האזנה אמרתי, “hear my&nbsp;voice...give ear to my speech,” it is evident that his wives&nbsp;were quite angry and rebellious at him at that time. Lemech&nbsp;exclaims (seeing that he had been blind) “did I deliberately&nbsp;kill someone?” [In other words, how can you blame me? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">האזנה, </span><span class="font5">this word, meaning: “listen please,” has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzeyreh</span><span class="font5"> under the letter </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">zayin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,24. כי שבעתים יוקם קין</span><span class="font5">, “if even Kayin, who had deliberately murdered his brother will be avenged sevenfold&nbsp;if someone took the law into his own hands and killed him,&nbsp;after G’d had been content to merely exile him, how much&nbsp;more so will anyone killing me be avenged, seeing that I had&nbsp;not done any harm to anyone deliberately, ever!? He is&nbsp;threatening his wives of what would happen to them if they&nbsp;felt they had to avenge Kayin’s death by harming him or&nbsp;killing him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעים ושבעה</span><span class="font5">, “seventy seven times.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi, </span><span class="font5">Lemech’s wives had separated from him after he had fulfilled&nbsp;the commandment of being fruitful, as they knew that the&nbsp;descendants of the killer of Kayin had been cursed by G’d for&nbsp;the following seven generations, so why would they have to&nbsp;bring children into the word in order for them to have to&nbsp;endure that curse? They would all be killed by the deluge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There appears to be a contradiction here in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s </span><span class="font5">commentary. If these wives refused to bear more children&nbsp;because by that time, more than 120-years prior to the&nbsp;deluge, that threat had already been known, then their&nbsp;refusals to bear children on account of a curse resting on the&nbsp;seven generations following Kayin’s killer are quite irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Seeing that the Torah does not provide us with details of the ages at which Kayin’s descendants were born relative&nbsp;to Adam’s expulsion from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gan Eden,</span><span class="font5"> the only clue we have&nbsp;is the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tradition </span><span class="font5">that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Naamah,</span><span class="font5"> Lemech’s daughter, became&nbsp;the wife of Noach, who started having children about 100&nbsp;years before the deluge (1656). Seeing that the people&nbsp;mentioned in the Torah, with the exception of Chanoch, had&nbsp;all lived for more than 800 years the fact that Lemech (the&nbsp;descendant of Kayin), not to be confused with the Lemech&nbsp;who was a descendant of Sheth, and Noach’s father, had&nbsp;every reason to expect to be still alive when the deluge&nbsp;would occur. After all, 777 years of the 1656 years prior to&nbsp;the deluge had already elapsed at the time Kayin was killed.&nbsp;The tradition concerning’ Naamah’s ancestry is plausible&nbsp;unless we were to believe that none of Kayin’s descendants&nbsp;survived the deluge. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our author prefers to believe that the daughters of Lemech erred in their calculations about during which&nbsp;Lemech’s lifetime the deluge would commence. Their father&nbsp;was the sixth generation from Adam, but seeing that Kayin&nbsp;married presumably at a much younger age than his brother&nbsp;Sheth who was 130 years younger than he, this is not&nbsp;plausible either, as Noach’s father died before his own father&nbsp;Metushelach who lived to 969, until the week before the&nbsp;commencement of the deluge. [Noach was the tenth&nbsp;generation, counting from Adam. Ed.] Our author believes&nbsp;that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> believes that Lemech and his daughters must&nbsp;have been great fools if they believed that G’d will allow 7&nbsp;generations to pass before avenging someone’s wrongful&nbsp;death. If that were G’d’s way, who would ever associate the&nbsp;penalty with the wrongdoer, seeing that seven generations&nbsp;had elapsed since the crime had been committed? It is clear&nbsp;that what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> wrote was not his own interpretation, but he&nbsp;quoted the foolish notions entertained by Lemech’s&nbsp;daughters. [How could G’d then have punished the&nbsp;generation born less than a generation before the deluge&nbsp;started?]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותקרא את שמו שת</span><span class="font5">, “she named him </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sheth.</span><span class="font5"> Later on&nbsp;we get the impression that Adam had called this son </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sheth.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">(5,3). The reason that there Adam, the father is credited with&nbsp;having named this son is only because when writing history,&nbsp;the Torah always traces the ancestry first and foremost to the&nbsp;father, it was quite in order to do so in that context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שת</span><span class="font5">, a reminder that the entire human race is descended from this man. The word is used in a similar context in the&nbsp;Bible in Samuel I 2,8: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישת עליהם תבל</span><span class="font5">, “He has set the world&nbsp;upon them.” [Compare Chanah’s prayer, saying that G’d set&nbsp;the rocks as the foundation of the earth. Ed.] She hinted that&nbsp;the descendants of the senior brother all perished during the&nbsp;deluge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרא את שמו אנוש</span><span class="font5">, “he called him Enosh.” There&nbsp;were four major upheavals on earth during the lifetime of&nbsp;Enosh. 1) Mountains and hills became bare rocks, unfit for&nbsp;grazing or any form of agriculture; 2) bodies of dead people&nbsp;began to emit foul smell as they started to decompose; 3)&nbsp;man’s facial features gradually became more like that of&nbsp;apes; 4) as a result of their losing the “image of G’d,” in&nbsp;which original man had been created, demons lost their fear&nbsp;of attacking human beings. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yalkut Shimoni,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Chronicles I 1072.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אז הוחל</span><span class="font5">, “then began desecration;” the word is similar to Numbers 30,3, where it describes dishonouring one’s vow,&nbsp;desecrating something sacred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זה ספר תולדות אדם</span><span class="font5">, “this is the book recording the&nbsp;history of mankind;” the Torah refers to the history of the&nbsp;strain of human beings that survived the deluge, i.e. the&nbsp;descendants of Sheth, through Noach and his children. It&nbsp;therefore commences once more with the founding member&nbsp;of mankind, Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרא את שמם אדם</span><span class="font5">, He named them: “Adam.” G’d&nbsp;called them by the name by which Adam had described&nbsp;himself when asked by G’d how he would name himself.&nbsp;(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah Sh’leymah</span><span class="font5"> for source) In the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash&nbsp;socher tov,</span><span class="font5"> a conversation during which G’d asks Adam how&nbsp;he would like to be named, he answered that he would like to&nbsp;be called אדם to reflect the fact that the raw material his body&nbsp;was made of was the earth. When G’d continued by asking&nbsp;him how he viewed Him, he answered that He should be&nbsp;refereed to as “Master, Lord” (אדון) as He is the Master of the&nbsp;universe. G’d accepted this suggestion when He declared in&nbsp;Isaiah 42,8: אני ה',הוא שמי, “I am the Lord, this is My name as&nbsp;Adam called Me thus.” [He added there that this is the&nbsp;reason why no other phenomenon must ever be called by&nbsp;His name; Ed.]. The reason why this paragraph has been&nbsp;inserted here is in order to teach us the origins of some&nbsp;names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויולד בדמותו כצלמו</span><span class="font5">, “he begot a son in his likeness in&nbsp;his image;” the emphasis on this is to show us that anything&nbsp;he begot during the previous 129 years were only creatures&nbsp;that did not reflect his likeness or image, i.e. disembodied&nbsp;spirits, mostly מזיקים, injurious, destructive spirits. (Compare&nbsp;3,20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,8. ויהיו כל ימי אדם תשע מאות שנה ושלשים שנה</span><span class="font5">, “Adam lived&nbsp;for a total of 930 years.” This is not a precise number, i.e.&nbsp;that he lived 930 years to the day after his creation, but that&nbsp;he lived longer than 929 years. This rule applied to all the&nbsp;numbers given in the Torah for the number of years that&nbsp;people lived prior to the deluge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וימת</span><span class="font5">, “he died;” this is the standard formula used by the Torah for the death of anyone who died before Noach. It is to&nbsp;tell us that this death occurred not due to sickness, etc., but&nbsp;due to the curse of mortality that man became subject to&nbsp;after having been seduced by the serpent. From Noach’s&nbsp;time onward, the Torah did not always add the fact that a&nbsp;person died, once it had informed us about how many years&nbsp;they lived. [The author’s problem appears to have been that&nbsp;the words: “he died,” were superfluous once we knew how&nbsp;old they became. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,18. ויולד את חנוך</span><span class="font5">, “he begat Chanoch.” This was the seventh generation, a number that was predestined for&nbsp;holiness and sanctity. David is also mentioned as having&nbsp;been the seventh son of his father Yishai, although that had&nbsp;been obvious from the way Samuel had been looking for the&nbsp;man to replace King Sha-ul. (Chronicles I 2,15) The number&nbsp;“seven” is special in the seven “heavens,” the seven deserts&nbsp;the Jewish people traversed, i.e. the desert of Sinai, in the&nbsp;seven seas, i.e. Lake Tiberias. [The subject has been&nbsp;expanded upon in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer,</span><span class="font5"> chapter 18. Ed.]&nbsp;The seventh universe (which according to our tradition, will&nbsp;be the last and perfect universe), as well as the seventh day&nbsp;of Creation, are all examples of the significance of the&nbsp;number “seven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,24. ואיננו</span><span class="font5">, “and suddenly he had disappeared;” his “death” is described as if he had never lived, as he died so&nbsp;much younger than all the other people named in the Bible&nbsp;so far [except for Hevel who had been murdered. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואיננו כי לקח אותו אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “he had disappeared as G’d had taken him.” [In the Torah commentary of Samuel David</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Luzatto, (translated recently by this editor) this formulation is understood as definite proof that there is an&nbsp;afterlife of the soul in heavenly region. Ed.] According to our&nbsp;author, Onkelos [not in our editions, Ed,] translates the word&nbsp;איננו here as meaning: “he still exists,” meaning that seeing&nbsp;that G’d had not let him die, he will return at the time before&nbsp;the Messiah comes, with Elijah. He claims that this contrasts&nbsp;with Onkelos in all other places where the word: אין appears&nbsp;where he translated it as that the phenomenon described no&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">longer</span><span class="font5"> existed. According to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zohar, Chanoch</span><span class="font5"> died a&nbsp;natural death, G’d removing him from the temptation to fall&nbsp;victim to the wicked ways of his contemporaries. [This would&nbsp;explain why so many outstanding Jewish Rabbis died before&nbsp;reaching the age of 40, G’d rewarding them </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> they&nbsp;would succumb to more temptations on this earth. Ed.] The&nbsp;prophet Jonah had asked G’d to be treated thus. (Jonah 4,3)&nbsp;Compare also Psalms: 49,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויולד בן</span><span class="font5">, “he begat a son;” the Torah did not write:&nbsp;“he sired Noach,” as it did in similar situations, i.e. Genesis&nbsp;5,6; 5,9; Judges 11,1; Chronicles I 1,34, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">et al.</span><span class="font5"> The reason is&nbsp;that Noach warranted an extra verse seeing that the whole&nbsp;human race today exists thanks to him. The entire human&nbsp;race was destroyed during his lifetime; only he, his wife and&nbsp;his children and their wives, having been saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: Metushelach, Lemech’s father, advised his son not to immediately name him as his&nbsp;contemporaries who were worshipping all kinds of idols, and&nbsp;who would curse and kill people who were monotheists,&nbsp;would try and kill him by telling their idols his name. After&nbsp;Noach had married and had sired a son, his father turned to&nbsp;his father again and was told then to call him Noach, as he&nbsp;had the potential to save all of mankind if they would follow&nbsp;his lifestyle. If not, they would all perish before they could&nbsp;harm him. (Compare Torah </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’leymah</span><span class="font5"> item 71 on this verse)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זה ינחמנו מן האדמה</span><span class="font5">, “this one will bring us&nbsp;consolation regarding the condition of the earth. Seeing that&nbsp;he had been born after the death of Adam, the curse decreed&nbsp;on earth as being effective during Adam’s lifetime could now&nbsp;be lifted. [According to my calculation Noach was born in the&nbsp;year 1056 after Adam had been created. Seeing that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Torah did not report anyone being born after Lemech, Noach’s father, who was born when Adam was still alive,&nbsp;there is no contradiction here. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,32. ויהי נח בן חמש מאות שנה ויולד</span><span class="font5">, “When Noach was five hundred years old, he begat;” people knew that the deluge&nbsp;was about to occur, as explained by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> already in&nbsp;connection with the attitudes displayed by the wives of&nbsp;Lemech (the descendant of Kayin); he therefore delayed&nbsp;becoming a father until G’d had promised him that he and his&nbsp;children would survive. [Up until then, the Torah had reported&nbsp;of people beginning to father children around the age of 100.&nbsp;Ed.] (based on an ancient version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בני אלהים</span><span class="font5">, according to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai,(in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah 26,5)</span><span class="font5"> the word אלהים here is to be&nbsp;understood as: “judges.” He was very angry at people who&nbsp;translated this expression as “sons of G’d.” The question&nbsp;remains why, the other Rabbis translated the word as they&nbsp;did? The answer given by both Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish&nbsp;and Rabbi Yochanan is that these people lived untroubled&nbsp;lives of tremendous length, so that they could easily have&nbsp;been confused with children whom G’d Himself had sired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מכל אשר בחרו</span><span class="font5">, as they were extremely intelligent, they selected for themselves wives who were equally intelligent or&nbsp;almost so, so that their children would enjoy the genetic&nbsp;benefits of their superior intelligence and physical strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.3. לא ידון רוחי באדם, </span><span class="font5">“My spirit will not predominate within man;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the meaning of this phrase&nbsp;is that G’d feels that He will not continue for much longer to&nbsp;entertain conflicting emotions concerning the future of&nbsp;mankind in such conditions; we find a similar construction as&nbsp;here in Job:2,3 where G’d is on record as telling Satan that&nbsp;nowhere on earth can there be found a man as righteous&nbsp;Job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of this phrase: the philological background is נדן ותיק, “returning one sword to its sheath,”&nbsp;quoted by Ibn Ezra, but not attributed to a source that he&nbsp;revealed. The “sheath,” would be man’s body. In other&nbsp;words, man would be reduced to being a body without Divine&nbsp;spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעולם</span><span class="font5">, for an interminably long period. Compare use of the word לעולם, in Samuel I 1,22. [When Chanah made this&nbsp;vow concerning her son Samuel, she did not use the word as&nbsp;meaning: “forever,” as in: לעולם ועד. Ed.] In Exodus 21,6&nbsp;where the Torah speaks of the servant who had his ear&nbsp;pierced continuing to serve the same master: לעולם, the&nbsp;meaning also could not possibly have been: “forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בשגם הוא בשר</span><span class="font5">, seeing that he is composed only of “flesh,” i.e. a combination of components that will not endure forever.&nbsp;Seeing that he was not meant to live forever anyways, he&nbsp;might as well have his normal lifespan shortened, as&nbsp;longevity did not inspire him to be loyal to his Creator. On the&nbsp;contrary, the illusion of living forever contributed to his feeling&nbsp;unaccountable to Me. (G’d).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיו ימיו מאה ועשרים שנה, </span><span class="font5">“and his (average) life span shall be one hundred and twenty years.” On this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments&nbsp;that the Torah is not restricted to report events in their&nbsp;chronological order. When we learned in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim 6,</span><span class="font5"> that&nbsp;when the subject is a single one, the rule of the Torah not&nbsp;being bound to report them in chronological order does not&nbsp;apply, so that here we would be faced with a contradiction,&nbsp;this is not so. We are dealing here with two separate&nbsp;subjects. Consider that from the birth of Yephet until the&nbsp;onset of the deluge only 100 years had elapsed, seeing the&nbsp;Torah testified that Noach, who was 600 years old at the&nbsp;outbreak of the deluge, had only married and become a&nbsp;father at the age of five hundred. The Torah was concerned&nbsp;with the moral image of Noach, and so that the world would&nbsp;not be able to say that Noach had sired a child knowing that&nbsp;it would perish after he knew already that G’d would destroy&nbsp;the human race, (Genesis 6,7) the Torah reported Noach’s&nbsp;having sired Shem already </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">before </span><span class="font5">it referred to G’d’s resolve&nbsp;to destroy the human race. G’d’s decision to destroy mankind&nbsp;(bar Noach and his family) had not been </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">revealed </span><span class="font5">to anyone&nbsp;including Noach until 6,13. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> offers a similar commentary&nbsp;on Genesis 11,32, where the death of Avraham’s father is&nbsp;reported at an age of 205 years, before it reported Avram’s&nbsp;moving to the land of Canaan, although Terach lived on after&nbsp;Avram’s leaving him for another 40 years. Had his death&nbsp;been reported in chronological order, some people would&nbsp;have faulted Avram for abandoning an aged father in&nbsp;Charan. As it is reported, the subject of Terach had already&nbsp;been concluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הנפלים</span><span class="font5">, “of outstanding stature;” the absence of the&nbsp;letter א in this word which we would have expected to have&nbsp;been spelled הנפלאים, is not unique; we find it also in Exodus&nbsp;33,16: ונפלינו אני ועמך, “and we, Your people will be&nbsp;outstanding;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">היו בארץ בימים ההם</span><span class="font5">, “were prominent on earth at that time.” This is a reference to conditions discussed by the&nbsp;Torah previously, which had been introduced with the words:&nbsp;ויהי כי החל האדם in 6,1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וגם אחרי כן, </span><span class="font5">“and also subsequently.” Even after G’d had expressed His anger at man’s conduct on earth, as&nbsp;described in: 6,3, Man had not leaned to submit to the&nbsp;supremacy of its Creator as testified to by verse two which&nbsp;described their disrespect for holy matrimony, i.e. the status&nbsp;of a wife as inalienably linked to her husband was completely&nbsp;ignored by the physically superior men wishing to possess&nbsp;women to whom they were attracted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אנשי השם</span><span class="font5">, “men of great reputation; Rabbi Acha, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 26,7, contrasting our verse with Job 30,8 in&nbsp;which these people are described as בני נבל גם בני בלי שם נכאו&nbsp;מן הארץ, “scoundrels, nobodies, stricken from the earth,”&nbsp;queries the way the Torah here refers to these wicked people&nbsp;as: “somebodies;” He therefore understands the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">השם </span><span class="font5">in&nbsp;our verse as meaning that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">השמו: </span><span class="font5">“they desecrated the world&nbsp;and as a result were הושמו, eliminated from it. [From the root:&nbsp;שמם to desolate. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי רבה רעת האדם</span><span class="font5">, “for man’s wickedness had become&nbsp;very great;” it is futile to ask that seeing that G’d has&nbsp;foreknowledge of all that man will do, creating him had been&nbsp;an exercise in futility to start with; why had G’d bothered?&nbsp;The answer is that everything is under the control of heaven&nbsp;except man’s decision to live in awe of the Creator or to defy&nbsp;Him. Seeing that G’d had decided to create a creature&nbsp;equipped with free will, He had simultaneously abrogated His&nbsp;right to interfere as long as man’s use of his freedom did not&nbsp;threaten to undo His universe. The reader is reminded of&nbsp;Deuteronomy 10,12, where Moses tells the people that G’d&nbsp;“asks” the people to revere Him; he did not say that G’d had&nbsp;“commanded” the people to revere Him. He also quoted G’d&nbsp;as expressing the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">wish</span><span class="font5"> that the people could maintain their&nbsp;moral high, as expressed after the revelation at Mount Sinai.&nbsp;In other words, He Himself had restricted His freedom in&nbsp;matters of religious belief of His creature. (Deuteronomy&nbsp;5,26) “May they always be of such mind, to revere Me, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third verse spelling out the choice before all of us is found in Deut.30,14: “see I have given before you this day,&nbsp;life and goodness, or death and evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,6. 'וינחם ה</span><span class="font5">, the expression: נחם,נחמה is used in three different contexts; 1) deliberate failure to fulfill a vow, such as&nbsp;when it could not be fulfilled as the person who had made it&nbsp;does not have the means to do so. 2) He has simply&nbsp;changed his mind. 3) It is used repeatedly in connection with&nbsp;G’d having second thoughts about something He had done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d’s having second thoughts works in two directions as we know from: רגע אדבר על גוי לנתוש ולנתוץ ושב הגוי מרעתו&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ונחמתי</span><span class="font5"> על הטובה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> “</span><span class="font5">at one moment I may decree that a nation&nbsp;or a kingdom shall be uprooted and pulled down and&nbsp;destroyed; but if that nation against which I had made the&nbsp;decree, turns back from its wickedness, I change My mind&nbsp;concerning the punishment I planned to bring on it.&nbsp;(Jeremiah 18,7-9) [I am sure all my readers are familiar with&nbsp;the story of Jonah and the whale, and how G’d changed His&nbsp;mind about the fate of Nineveh when He observed how they&nbsp;repented. Ed.] There is no need here to repeated how G’d&nbsp;“repented” the decree He had issued against the Jewish&nbsp;people after they had made the golden calf and had danced&nbsp;around it calling it a deity. G’d had “regretted” allowing Sha-ul&nbsp;to have been crowned king, and He ordered Samuel to&nbsp;anoint his successor. (Samuel I 15,11 and subsequent.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the statement by Bileam in Numbers 23,21, that what distinguishes the Jewish G’d from other deities is that:&nbsp;ובן אדם כי יתנחם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">neither is He like a human being who&nbsp;changes his mind,” there the word is used in the reflexive&nbsp;mode, i.e. the human being who initiates his own change of&nbsp;mind, whereas when changing G’d’s mind is the issue, this&nbsp;was always forced upon G’d from the outside. He does not&nbsp;allow Himself the luxury of changing His mind as an act of&nbsp;pique, completely unprovoked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויתעצב אל לבו</span><span class="font5">, “He was saddened to have listened to the advice to create man;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: the words: אל לבו refer to the heart of man; G’d felt saddened on account of man’s heart, i.e. the&nbsp;constantly evil thoughts that he entertained. We find a similar&nbsp;construction in Samuel I 20,34 כי נעצב אל דוד כי הכלמו אביו, “he&nbsp;was saddened on account that his father had humiliated&nbsp;him.” (Yonathan about his father the King, humiliating his&nbsp;bosom fried David)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another exegesis of our verse: Whenever the root עצב occurs it refers to mourning or something akin to it.&nbsp;Example: כי נעצב המלך על בנו, “for the king mourned over the&nbsp;los of his son.” (Samuel II 19,3, about the death of Avshalom)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In our verse the Torah describes G’d as mourning the world He had created and which He now had to completely&nbsp;restructure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask how it is possible to mourn people who had not died yet, this rule applies only to mortal human&nbsp;beings who cannot be sure of any event in the future until it&nbsp;materializes; G’d Who foresees developments clearly, can be&nbsp;saddened and in a state of mourning even before the actual&nbsp;event has taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation of our verse; the human race had become something only worthy of sadness and distaste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,7. אמחה את האדם</span><span class="font5">, “I shall wipe out the human race;” when G’d had created the human He had not prefaced this&nbsp;with the singular mode: אעשה, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">I shall make</span><span class="font5">,” but He had&nbsp;said: נעשה, “let us make,” as He had consulted with the&nbsp;angels about that project. As soon as He had created them&nbsp;the angels had belittled this creature, saying: מה אנוש כי&nbsp;תזכרנו, “what is so special about the human race that You,&nbsp;G’d, should devote so much time and effort to its creation?”&nbsp;(Psalms 8,5) This is why He did not consult them about&nbsp;wiping out the human race. A few hundred years later, when&nbsp;man had built the Tower, G’d once more consulted with the&nbsp;angels about what punishment to administer to these people&nbsp;who had developed such arrogance. (compare Genesis 11,7:&nbsp;הבה נרדה ובבלה שפתם, “let us descend and confuse their&nbsp;language.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי נחמתי כי עשיתי</span><span class="font5">, this is how G’d referred to sinful man; but when man was loyal and G’d fearing, He boasted with&nbsp;their loyalty, lauding them for their steadfastness and refusal&nbsp;to regret having accepted the Torah; (compare Numbers&nbsp;23,21, לא איש א-ל ויכזב ובן אדם כי יתנחם, “I am not disappointed&nbsp;in this people. It does not cause Me any regrets.” (loosely&nbsp;translated by this Editor) We find in that verse another&nbsp;allusion that change in attitude always first occurs in G’d’s&nbsp;creature, never in G’d, so that what appears as G’d changing&nbsp;course is really only His </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">reaction</span><span class="font5"> to man’s perversity.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Noach</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,9. אלה תולדות נח</span><span class="font5">, “These are the descendants of Noach;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 30,3, whenever a&nbsp;paragraph commences with the word: אלה, this is equivalent&nbsp;to dissociating what occurs from then on with what had been&nbsp;discussed previously; Noach, was not a continuation of the&nbsp;history of mankind up until now, but represents a 180 degree&nbsp;turn from that history. Whereas the generations prior to him&nbsp;progressed toward their destruction, he represented a new&nbsp;beginning for mankind. He founded a new type of human&nbsp;being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תולדות נח</span><span class="font5">, the word תולדות, refers to happenings and their causes. For instance: Proverbs 27,1 כי לא תדע מה ילד&nbsp;היום, “for you do not know what the day will bring.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">offers the same interpretation concerning the line: אלה תולדות&nbsp;יעקב, יוסף, “these are the descendants of Yaakov, Joseph.”&nbsp;(Genesis 37,2). The Torah now readies itself to record the&nbsp;history of mankind as if it had commenced with Noach, and it&nbsp;attributes events that will be described as the direct or&nbsp;indirect result of Noach’s influence on them. It sums up the&nbsp;difference by describing Noach as a righteous man, when&nbsp;compared with his ancestors. It attributes the demise of his&nbsp;ancestors as basically due to their wickedness, [even though&nbsp;a few individuals in each generation had not been wicked.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איש צדיק, תמים היה</span><span class="font5">, “a righteous man, basically perfect.” This is the reason why Noach had found favour in the eyes of&nbsp;his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תמים</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bar Chataya</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit</span><span class="font5"> 30,8, the meaning of this word is that the people named all lived a&nbsp;number of years which divide into the number 7. Noach lived&nbsp;350 years after being called תמים, i.e. 50 times seven,&nbsp;Avraham 175, i.e. 25 times seven, etc. [The commentators&nbsp;on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> elaborate on that strange sounding&nbsp;definition of תמים. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">היה</span><span class="font5">, anyone in the Holy Scriptures of whom it is said: היה, experienced a new world, i.e. radical changes in the&nbsp;world. In the case of Noach, he was a witness to the&nbsp;destruction of earth and its inhabitants during the year he&nbsp;spent in the ark, only to become a witness to its renewal after&nbsp;he emerged from the ark. Joseph at one time was a lowly&nbsp;second rate shepherd with his brothers, יוסף </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">היה</span><span class="font5"> רועה את אחיו,&nbsp;and became the second most powerful man in Egypt, whose&nbsp;population he saved from starvation. Moses was a shepherd&nbsp;for his father-in-law, ומשה היה רועה, yesterday he had had to&nbsp;flee for his life, and subsequently he rose to lead his people&nbsp;into freedom and greatness. Job started out as a wealthy&nbsp;man, איש היה בארץ עוץ איוב שמו, was reduced to absolute&nbsp;misery and destitution, only to rise again to be even greater&nbsp;than originally. (Job 42,10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.10. ויולד נח שלשה בנים, </span><span class="font5">“Noach fathered three sons;” the Torah repeated this, having told us this already in 5,32,&nbsp;as it wanted to tell us that Noach was righteous in the&nbsp;generations prior to the deluge and after the deluge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.11. ותשחת הארץ לפני האלוהים</span><span class="font5">, the words: לפני האלוקים at first glance appear unnecessary; however these words are&nbsp;providing the clue to the moral disintegration of mankind. It&nbsp;started at the top, because the בני האלוהים, high ranking&nbsp;individuals, mentioned in Genesis 2,6, had set an example of&nbsp;depravity; it did not take long for them to be copied by the&nbsp;people at large. Noach was the only one who “swam against&nbsp;the stream.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בארץ</span><span class="font5">, they raped women against their will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותמלא הארץ חמס</span><span class="font5">, there is a discussion between the sages as to the difference in meaning between the word: חמס&nbsp;(violence) and the word גזל (robbery) when used in the Holy&nbsp;Scriptures. According to Rabbi Chaninah, the difference is&nbsp;m erely in the amount m isappropriated by violent m eans. If&nbsp;the object one robs is worth more than a certain ancient&nbsp;copper coin, known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p’rutah,</span><span class="font5"> the term חמס is used,&nbsp;whereas if it is worth less than that, the Torah refers to it as&nbsp;גזל. The people of the generation of the deluge devised a&nbsp;nefarious scheme of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">avoiding </span><span class="font5">to become guilty of having&nbsp;misappropriated at one time more than the worth of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prutah.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">When someone brought a basket full of fruit to market&nbsp;offering to sell it, he would be mobbed by people each of&nbsp;whom helped himself to less than the value of that coin. By&nbsp;using this subterfuge, the party helping himself to fruit without&nbsp;paying for it, escaped being cited before a judge, who did not&nbsp;entertain claims below that amount. How did G’d outwit these&nbsp;people? He would deprive them of the excess wealth they&nbsp;had accumulated by such means at the times they died.&nbsp;(This is how Ibn Ezra interprets Job 4,21 which he explains&nbsp;as G’d depriving such “robbers” of the excess money they&nbsp;had accumulated at the time they died, so that they would be&nbsp;punished by not having benefited by Torah knowledge&nbsp;(according to our author).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[If I understand the author correctly, he means that when people use their Torah knowledge in order to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">escape&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">their responsibilities, then instead of getting credit for their&nbsp;Torah studies, they will find that their abuse of Torah had&nbsp;been counterproductive; they will be worse off than if they&nbsp;had not studied Torah. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation understands the word as indulging in sexual misconduct, basing itself on Jeremiah&nbsp;51,35: חמסי ושארי על בבל, “let the violence done to me and my&nbsp;kindred be visited upon Babylon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third interpretation understands the word חמס as an alternate for idolatry, quoting Ezekiel 8,17: כי מלאו את הארץ&nbsp;חמס להכעיסני, “that they must fill the land with the&nbsp;abominations in order to anger Me;” (these have been&nbsp;described in the verses preceding this one)?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lastly, some commentators understand the word חמס as applying to shedding innocent blood, basing itself on Joel&nbsp;4,19: מחמס בני יהודה אשר שפכו דם נקי בארצם, “from the חמס of&nbsp;the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Yehudah who spilled&nbsp;innocent blood in their land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,12. כי השחית כל בשר את דרכו</span><span class="font5">, “for all flesh had corrupted its behaviour on earth. This is a reference to sexual&nbsp;perversions as in Proverbs 30,19, ודרך גבר בעלמה, “and the&nbsp;way of a man with a virgin.” Mankind had already been&nbsp;commanded since the 6<sup>th</sup> day of creation: תוצא הארץ נפש חיה&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">למינה.</span><span class="font5"> בהמה ורמש וחיתו ארץ </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">למינה,</span><span class="font5"> “let the earth produce living&nbsp;creatures each according to its kind; cattle, creeping things,&nbsp;and wild beasts, each according to its kind. This made it&nbsp;clear that bestiality, homosexuality, lesbianism and all other&nbsp;kinds of unnatural sexual behaviour is considered by the&nbsp;Lord as an abomination, and had been so since creation.&nbsp;“When I will now destroy man I am only applying the same&nbsp;yardstick man applied when indulging in unnatural sexual&nbsp;practices which do not result in populating My earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כל בשר, “all flesh,” excluding the fish; seeing that fish had not become corrupted, they were spared; this is why the&nbsp;Torah emphasised that כל אשר בחרבה מתו, that “all the&nbsp;creatures whose habitat was the dry land had died.”&nbsp;(Genesis 8,22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">6.13. את הארץ, the word את, at the end of the verse,&nbsp;includes all the previously not spelled out creatures on earth.&nbsp;An example of such indirect references is: Exodus 19,5: כי לי&nbsp;כל הארץ, “for the entire earth is Mine,” where the word כל&nbsp;substitutes for: “all the creatures on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">6.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עשה לך תיבת, “make an ark for yourself etc;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">comments on this by asking the rhetorical question that&nbsp;“seeing that G’d has unlimited space at His disposal, why did&nbsp;He choose such a compact little ark in which to coop up all&nbsp;the creatures He meant to save?” His answer is that if&nbsp;mankind would constantly see that Noach was totally&nbsp;preoccupied with the construction of this ark as a means to&nbsp;ride out the deluge, perhaps they would take this to heart and&nbsp;become penitents. (Based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma)</span><span class="font5"> Our author finds&nbsp;this difficult, seeing that G’d had known His hopes would be&nbsp;disappointed, and that was hardly a reason to make life in&nbsp;the ark so uncomfortable for all the creatures in it. He&nbsp;therefore prefers to answer the question in a different&nbsp;manner. He claims that G’d wanted to show the attribute of&nbsp;Mercy that He had done all in His power to encourage people&nbsp;to stave off disaster when they saw how seriously Noach&nbsp;took G’d’s warning. In 7,12 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> himself mentions this&nbsp;attempt by G’d to stave off disaster by G’d initially allowing&nbsp;rain which was not accompanied by storms and&nbsp;subterranean sluices opening, to serve as an a additional&nbsp;warning. G’d did all this to convince the attribute of Mercy&nbsp;that further delay was quite useless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">עצי גופר, “gopher wood;” this is the wood the resin of which yields sulfur. It is not soluble in water, and G’d chose it&nbsp;to remind those who watched it. [Noach included according&nbsp;to this interpretation, as it had taken an act of mercy by G’d&nbsp;to save him and his family Ed.] being used that they&nbsp;deserved to be judged by sulfur. (The material used to&nbsp;destroy Sodom some 400 years later. Compare Genesis&nbsp;19,24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכפרת אותו מבית ומחוץ בכופר</span><span class="font5">, “you are to seal it from the inside as well as from the outside with pitch;” our sages&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 108) comment on this that seeing mankind had&nbsp;sinned with “boiling water,” they were punished by means of&nbsp;boiling water. [The expression is used in the Talmud to&nbsp;describe ejaculation of heated semen in sexually forbidden&nbsp;intercourse. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to query that in our experience pitch does not withstand boiling water but dissolves in it, this was&nbsp;another miracle [to show that G’d can use even such material&nbsp;to help save the innocent. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: The water surrounding the immediate proximity remained cool, whereas the waters&nbsp;further away were bubbling hot. If this were not the correct&nbsp;interpretation, how could we explain that Gog, Sichon and his&nbsp;brothers had survived the deluge? (Compare Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Niddah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">61, according to the opinion in the Talmud that the deluge&nbsp;had also inundated the land of Israel)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,16. צהר תעשה לתיבה </span><span class="font5">“you are to provide means of illumination for the ark.” According to most opinions this is a&nbsp;reference to the window that Noach used later on to dispatch&nbsp;the raven and the turtle dove. During the period that this&nbsp;“window” was kept closed he suspended in that area a jewel&nbsp;which sparkled and provided interior lighting. When we&nbsp;understand this in this manner, our sages, some of whom&nbsp;spoke only of the jewel and others only of the “window,” are&nbsp;both correct, except that neither of them gave us the full&nbsp;explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Torah told Noach to provide interior lighting it was because during most of days of the deluge illumination&nbsp;from the sky was totally absent, neither sun, nor moon or&nbsp;stars being visible. Noach had to use his ingenuity to provide&nbsp;for interior lighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואל אמה תכלנה מלמעלה, </span><span class="font5">this phrase describes more detail about the expression צהר. It instructs Noach to affix the&nbsp;lighting near the top end of the ark. The “lamp” was&nbsp;supposed to be fuelled by oil, as hinted at by the letters in the&nbsp;word צהר which are the same as יצהר, “pure oil.” Both the&nbsp;words חלון and צהר are used in Scripture in the masculine&nbsp;and feminine mode. Compare Kings I 6,4. Interestingly&nbsp;enough, the word חלון, window is used both in the masculine&nbsp;and feminine mode, presumably as a reminder that windows&nbsp;can be used both in order to look out or in order to look in, or&nbsp;to allow light to come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ופתח התיבה בצדה תשים </span><span class="font5">“and you are to position the entrance to the ark sideways.” Contrary to what we might&nbsp;think the entrance was not to be in the middle of the&nbsp;broadside of the ark, but at the corner where it would be least&nbsp;exposed to the elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the word: בצדה; on the third level (from the bottom) of the ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תחתיים שניים, ושלישים</span><span class="font5">, the third floor (deck) was intended for the human beings inhabiting the ark, as well as for the&nbsp;storage of the entire food supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואני הנני</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> interprets these two words as: “and&nbsp;I have agreed,” i.e. “against the pleas of the attribute of&nbsp;Mercy which acted as advocate for sinful mankind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והקימותי את בריתי אתך, </span><span class="font5">“I will maintain My covenant&nbsp;with you.” The reference is to the covenant that Noach’s&nbsp;descendants will not be wiped out during the deluge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומכל החי</span><span class="font5">, “and of all living creatures, etc.”&nbsp;according to Rabbi Yehudah, the fully grown animal known&nbsp;as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">re-em</span><span class="font5"> did not enter the ark as it was too tall, whereas not&nbsp;fully developed specimens, did enter. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Matnot&nbsp;kehunah</span><span class="font5"> on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 31,13. According to Rabbi&nbsp;Nechemyah, the mature pair of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reems</span><span class="font5"> was tied by Noach to&nbsp;the outside of the ark. He bases himself on a verse in Job&nbsp;39,10, which hints at the length of the legs of this kind of&nbsp;animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מהעוף למינהו ומן הבהמה למינה </span><span class="font5">“including the&nbsp;feathered birds according to their various species and&nbsp;according to the four-legged beasts according to each&nbsp;specific species.” Seeing that the birds had been created on&nbsp;the fifth day of creation and the mammals on the sixth day,&nbsp;they are listed here in that order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מכל מאכל, </span><span class="font5">“from every category of food;” seeing&nbsp;that the ark contained all the living creatures that consumed&nbsp;food, Noach had to store the kind of food that was eaten by&nbsp;all these various creatures. The reason was that some&nbsp;creatures refused to touch food that other creatures enjoyed&nbsp;eating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כן עשה</span><span class="font5">, “so he did.” This is a reference to bringing&nbsp;all these various kinds of food inside the ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר ה</span><span class="font5">׳, “The Lord said:” The previous time G’d had&nbsp;been reported as speaking to Noach, (6,17) it was His&nbsp;attribute of Justice speaking, whereas here it refers to His&nbsp;attribute of Mercy addressing him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מכל הבהמה הטהורה, </span><span class="font5">“of all the pure mammals, etc;”&nbsp;according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash,i</span><span class="font5"> we can learn from this verse that Noach&nbsp;had studied the Torah. [from where else would he know&nbsp;which of the mammals are “pure” mammals. Ed.] If you were&nbsp;to counter that in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zevachim</span><span class="font5"> 116, we find the&nbsp;question: “since when did there exist a difference between&nbsp;the pure and the impure mammals at that period,” and the&nbsp;answer given to this question is that indeed at that time there&nbsp;did not exist a difference,” [If so what does </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> mean&nbsp;seeing that he was familiar with the section of the Talmud?&nbsp;Ed.] The answer given there is that all the animals which the&nbsp;ark accepted </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> delay were the species which had&nbsp;never been used as sacrifices for idols. The others were&nbsp;rejected by the ark. This still does not solve our question. On&nbsp;the contrary, it shows that seeing that Noach apparently had&nbsp;brought more than one pair of the impure animals to the ark&nbsp;he had been unaware that that species was going to be&nbsp;impure according to the Torah in the future!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We therefore have to resort to a different answer; any category of mammal of which Noach knew that it mated only&nbsp;with members of its own species, was recognised by Noach&nbsp;as one that in the future would be categorised by the Torah&nbsp;as a “pure species,” fit as an offering to the Lord;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Talmud referred to some categories of mammals initially being rejected by the ark, this indicated to&nbsp;Noach that the “concept” of purity and impurity had to do with&nbsp;the manner in which these species conducted their mating&nbsp;practices. In the Torah, in the future, the concept of purity&nbsp;and impurity is repeatedly used in respect to incestuous&nbsp;relationships in the Book of Leviticus chapter 18,34 and&nbsp;20,25. In those chapters the term “pure” and “impure,” refers&nbsp;to which of these animals may be used as food for members&nbsp;of the Jewish people. Seeing that Noach recognised which of&nbsp;these species were (to be) allowed as food, we can&nbsp;understand </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> comment. [which incidentally is based&nbsp;also on a statement in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 118. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different approach to the questions raised by our verse: the Talmud quoted in the tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zevachim</span><span class="font5"> did not&nbsp;deal with mammals, but with birds, so that the question&nbsp;raised referred only to how Noach could know which birds&nbsp;would qualify as the ones of which he was to take seven&nbsp;pairs each into the ark. Seeing that there are an innumerable&nbsp;number of “impure” birds, and even the written Torah had not&nbsp;revealed how to know which was which, the question of how&nbsp;Noach could know what even the written Torah did not reveal&nbsp;to us in Moses’ time was most appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Talmud’s answer that this was revealed to Noach when he watched what happened when the birds tried to&nbsp;enter the ark is therefore very reasonable. Noach had to rely&nbsp;on Divine guidance. The Talmud did not refer to the same&nbsp;problem concerning pure mammals, as there are only a small&nbsp;number of such, and Noach was familiar with the mating&nbsp;habits of these mammals. This led </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> to conclude that&nbsp;Noach had foreknowledge of what the Torah would decree at&nbsp;some time in the future. Seeing that due to the fact that these&nbsp;species would be allowed as food, the dangers that unless&nbsp;there were multiple pairs of them in the ark, they might die&nbsp;out, make it plausible that the Torah ordered him to take&nbsp;seven pairs of each. [Eating of meat had been completely&nbsp;forbidden prior to the deluge. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even though certain other non pure mammals serve as food for the gentiles, such as pigs, etc, the fact that these&nbsp;give birth to multiple young made it unlikely that they would&nbsp;die out even if only a single pair of them would be taken into&nbsp;the ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">*ft npn</span><span class="font5">, “take for yourself;” seven males and seven females each, so as to diminish the chances that they would&nbsp;die out. If any of the animals that were not considered as&nbsp;worth eating would die out this was a minor concern, as man&nbsp;would not miss that species. Seeing that the word שבעה,&nbsp;masculine for seven, was repeated by the Torah, led Noach&nbsp;to believe that he was meant to sacrifice some of these after&nbsp;surviving the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעה שבעה איש ואשתו</span><span class="font5">, “seven pairs each.” Seeing that among the mammals the males and the females of the&nbsp;animal kingdom are similar to that of human beings, the&nbsp;Torah describes the males and females as איש and אשתו.&nbsp;When speaking of the birds, which are not sexually&nbsp;recognisable by similar means, the Torah does not use this&nbsp;expression, but contents itself with writing: שבעה שבעה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,4. ארבעי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יו</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וארבעי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לילה</span><span class="font5">, “forty days and forty nights, consecutively.” The number of days, i.e. forty, corresponds to&nbsp;the number of lashes administered to people who have&nbsp;deliberately violated G’d’s negative commandments. (Deut.&nbsp;25,3) Alternately, the number is reminiscent of the 40 days&nbsp;during which Moses received the Torah from G’d while he&nbsp;was on Mount Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מפני מי המבול, </span><span class="font5">“on account of the waters of the&nbsp;deluge, and not on account of G’d’s command to enter the&nbsp;ark. [This is why the sages comment that even Noach was&nbsp;not a strong believer as he waited till necessity forced him to&nbsp;take refuge in the ark. Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומן הבהמה אשר איננה טהורה</span><span class="font5">, “and of the category of&nbsp;mammal that was not pure, etc.;” This “clumsy” way of&nbsp;describing “impure,” טמאה, by using eight extra letters merely&nbsp;to avoid having to use the expression: “impure,” caused the&nbsp;sages in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> 3, to teach us how&nbsp;concerned the Torah is that we use only dignified language&nbsp;even when describing repulsive phenomena. Actually, the&nbsp;Talmud could have derived this already from verse two in our&nbsp;chapter, i.e. אשר לא טהורה היא, but the Torah preferred to use&nbsp;this fine point when referring to beasts which basically are&nbsp;suitable as sacrifices on the altar, i.e. domesticated&nbsp;mammals, and free roaming mammals, although the latter do&nbsp;not qualify for the altar even though they may be allowed for&nbsp;us to eat. According to the Talmud, the word טהורה in verse 2&nbsp;of our chapter would have had to be spelled with the letter ו,&nbsp;i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">plene,</span><span class="font5"> which it is not in our texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,14</span><span class="font5">. כל צפור כל כנף, “every bird, every wing.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 32,8, these apparently superfluous words&nbsp;are to tell us that every one of these birds -some of which&nbsp;Noach would use as sacrifices later on,- were complete,&nbsp;whole, i.e. did not have a single feather missing, as this&nbsp;would have disqualified them as potential sacrifices. None&nbsp;had damaged reproductive organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסגור ה׳ בעדו</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord closed the door from the&nbsp;outside on his behalf.” Noach had left the door open, as&nbsp;seeing he did not know every species of creature, he was&nbsp;afraid that by closing the door prematurely he might prevent&nbsp;a species from gaining entry to the ark and that it therefore&nbsp;would die out. After they had all come, the wind closed the&nbsp;door as a signal that they had arrived. We find another&nbsp;example of this in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> 64, where the&nbsp;doors to the Temple entrance are described as closing-apparently on their own account- on the eve of Passover to&nbsp;signify that otherwise there would be overcrowding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.17. ויהי המבול ארבעים יום</span><span class="font5">, “the deluge lasted for 40 days;” how do we square this with verse 12 according to&nbsp;which the rain had continued for 40 days? We must assume&nbsp;that matters which had not been spelled out in the earlier&nbsp;verse have now been added, i.e. that after a period of 40&nbsp;days of continuous rain and other manifestations of the&nbsp;deluge, the ark began to rise from its site. We find a similar&nbsp;construction in verse 19 where the waters are described as&nbsp;covering the mountains, after the Torah had first given details&nbsp;about the gradual inundation of high places on earth by the&nbsp;waters of the deluge. Had we only read verse 18 and the first&nbsp;half of verse 19, we would not have been able to imagine the&nbsp;extent of the flooding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,20. ויכוסו ההרים</span><span class="font5">, “the mountains were covered (with water) hence what follows: ויגוע כל בשר “all flesh perished.”&nbsp;(verse 21) There was no place left to take refuge from the&nbsp;water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,21. וכל האדם</span><span class="font5">, “as well as every human being.” The word: אדם when used in the Holy Scriptures always includes&nbsp;men women and children. If you were to ask why the human&nbsp;race was punished when it had not been given&nbsp;commandments by G’d that had to be observed, we must&nbsp;answer that there are a number of rules for behaviour of&nbsp;society that mankind can be expected to honour without the&nbsp;need to be specifically commanded to do so. If proof were&nbsp;needed for this statement we remind you of Kayin being&nbsp;punished for having killed his brother Hevel, although there is&nbsp;no record that he was ever warned by G’d not to kill another&nbsp;human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.1. ויזכור אלקים את נח, “</span><span class="font5">G’d remembered Noach;” G’d remembered that for a full year Noach had fed the entire&nbsp;animal kingdom that was with him in the ark, playing “waiter”&nbsp;for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישכו המים</span><span class="font5">, “the waters subsided.” The wording proves that the waters were almost boiling hot. [Subsiding, meaning&nbsp;that they had bubbled previously. Ed.] The expression שככ is&nbsp;used also for King Ahasverus’ angers subsiding in Esther&nbsp;7,10. Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 108 on that verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.2. ויסכרו מעינות תהום רבה</span><span class="font5">, “The subterranean sluices of the earth were shut down;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points out that the absence&nbsp;here of the word: כל, “all,” i.e. all these sluices, is proof that&nbsp;some of these springs were left open for healing purposes so&nbsp;that man could enjoy them in the future. [Spas such as&nbsp;Marienbad, Karlsbad, Leukerbad, etc. Ed.] The hot springs of&nbsp;Tiberias are quoted by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> as an example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask that according to the opinion quoted in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> that the deluge did not affect the land of&nbsp;Israel, whence did the hot springs in Tiberias originate? 1)&nbsp;There are similar hot mineral springs all over the world,&nbsp;Tiberias just happens to be the only such in the Holy Land. 2)&nbsp;When the Torah first wrote about these springs having been&nbsp;opened at the time of the deluge, (7,11) when the Torah&nbsp;there spoke about “all the springs,” it clearly included the hot&nbsp;springs of Tiberias, although </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">rain </span><span class="font5">may not have fallen in the&nbsp;Holy Land during that period. When the springs closed, the&nbsp;ones in Tiberias were one of the several that remained open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויסכרו מעיינות תהום</span><span class="font5">, this is not really the logical place where we would have expected to find this verse. Rather, we&nbsp;would have expected it after 7,17, before continuing with that&nbsp;the waters continued to rise further. The reason it was&nbsp;inserted here is that the Torah wished to mention together all&nbsp;the causes that contributed to the termination of the deluge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,3. ויחסרו המים</span><span class="font5">, “the waters diminished;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this process began 150 days after the outbreak of the&nbsp;deluge, on the first day of the month of Sivan. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> arrives&nbsp;at this calculation from the Torah’s report that the deluge&nbsp;(rains) began on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the second month&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cheshvan)</span><span class="font5"> the rains -which lasted for 40 days having&nbsp;stopped falling on the 27<sup>th</sup> day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev.</span><span class="font5"> It is reasonable to&nbsp;assume that according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> calculation no rain fell on&nbsp;the 28<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev,</span><span class="font5"> so that day was already one of the 150&nbsp;days during which the water level on the earth kept rising&nbsp;without additional rainfall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, when the Torah had written in verse 12 of chapter 7 that the rainfall persisted for 40 days, the&nbsp;impression given is that the twenty eighth day of Kislev was&nbsp;still a rainy day, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> specifically states that the first day&nbsp;mentioned in the Torah did </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">count, as the rain had started&nbsp;during the daylight hours, i.e. long after the day had already&nbsp;commenced. The Torah describes the sky as breaking open&nbsp;during the daylight hours. According to this calculation the&nbsp;rains would only have stopped </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">during </span><span class="font5">the 28<sup>th</sup> of Kislev. We&nbsp;are forced therefore to understand </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> words as follows:&nbsp;“the first day of rainfall mentioned is the Torah is not to be&nbsp;considered as a “day” in the same sense as all the other&nbsp;days, seeing that all the other “days” mentioned included the&nbsp;preceding night; this day did not include the preceding night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you follow this approach you can understand </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> saying that the 17<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cheshvan</span><span class="font5"> was the first day on&nbsp;which rain fell and continued falling for 40 days. There were&nbsp;12 days left in that month, followed by 27 days in the month&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev,</span><span class="font5"> all of which included the preceding nights until&nbsp;daybreak on the 28<sup>th</sup> day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev.</span><span class="font5"> This tallies with what the&nbsp;Torah wrote: “The rain (came down) onto the earth for 40&nbsp;days and forty nights.” (7,12) When the Torah referred to 150&nbsp;days, these days do not need to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">include </span><span class="font5">the preceding&nbsp;nights, as the Torah itself states: “it was at the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">end of </span><span class="font5">150&nbsp;days.”(8,3). In other words: from daybreak on the 28<sup>th</sup> of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev</span><span class="font5"> until nightfall on the first day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you wish to count the 150 days as whole days including the preceding nights, you would have to count from&nbsp;the morning of the 28<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev</span><span class="font5"> until the morning until the&nbsp;morning of the first day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan,</span><span class="font5"> giving you a total of 150&nbsp;days and 150 nights. Even if you were to deduct the night of&nbsp;the 28th of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev</span><span class="font5"> according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"><sub>ג</sub> something irrelevant to&nbsp;the descent of rain for 40 days, the first of Sivan as the&nbsp;seventh month the first of Sivan, as stated in the Torah,&nbsp;would still be the beginning of the seventh month after the&nbsp;beginning of the deluge. [The significance of the number&nbsp;“seven” as a number signaling beneficial developments is&nbsp;most important in Judaism, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why the manner in which the Torah reported these details is significant is because if we were to&nbsp;start the count of the deluge (40 days of rainfall) from&nbsp;Cheshvan, the ark would not have come to rest on Mount&nbsp;Arrarat on the seventeenth of the seventh month (Sivan)&nbsp;from the daylight period of the seventeenth, but on the&nbsp;eighteenth. Our author demonstrates how this would have&nbsp;contradicted other dates mentioned later in the account of&nbsp;the gradual abating of the waters. The most important date&nbsp;mentioned is that on which the ark came to rest on solid&nbsp;ground, the first day of the first month of the 601<sup>st</sup> year of&nbsp;Noach’s life, i.e. on New Year’s day according to the Jewish&nbsp;calendar. It signaled a new and more propitious beginning in&nbsp;the history of mankind. On that day the waters had dried from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">surface </span><span class="font5">of the earth. [as distinct from “dry” as opposed to&nbsp;“muddy.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,4.בחודש השביעי, </span><span class="font5">“in the seventh month.” The “seventh” month mentioned here is the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan</span><span class="font5"> starting with&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev,</span><span class="font5"> the month during which the rains had ceased. On the&nbsp;tenth of the first month (verse 5) the first mountain tops&nbsp;became visible to Noach. This was the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Av</span><span class="font5"> in our&nbsp;calendar, which is the tenth month of the year starting with&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cheshvan</span><span class="font5"> the month during which the rain started falling.&nbsp;This is how </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands the text of the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to argue that the year of the deluge could have been a year which had 13 months, something easily&nbsp;computed, the whole calculation is erroneous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the data in the Torah, 1656 years had elapsed since the creation of Adam. We observe a cycle of 19 years&nbsp;during which 7 years are leap years, i.e. years of 13 months.&nbsp;A calculation would reveal that the year of the deluge would&nbsp;have been the third leap year during such a cycle. The result&nbsp;would be that the month of Sivan would not be the seventh&nbsp;but the eighth month of that particular year. According to this&nbsp;calculation the deluge would have commenced instead of in&nbsp;the 1656<sup>th</sup> year, in the year following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the data provided by the Torah: The calculation of the year of the deluge is based on&nbsp;the year of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tohu,</span><span class="font5"> the period preceding the creation of Adam.&nbsp;If so the year of the deluge was not a leap year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third possible approach to the data provided by the Torah on the timing of the deluge: the year of the deluge was&nbsp;not included in calendar calculations of world history,&nbsp;according to Rabbi Yochanan in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 33,3, as&nbsp;the planets in heaven did not describe their regular orbits&nbsp;during that period. Rabbi Yonathan responded to that&nbsp;statement by Rabbi Yochanan, that while the planets did not&nbsp;perform their function during that year, this does not mean&nbsp;that the year is to be considered as not having occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותנח התבה בחדש השביעי בשבעה עשר יום</span><span class="font5">, “the ark came to rest on the seventeenth day of the seventh month.”&nbsp;According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> we learn from this verse that the ark was&nbsp;deep in the water to a depth of 11 cubits. If you were to&nbsp;counter that the Torah reported that the tops of the&nbsp;mountains had become visible on the first day of Av, and that&nbsp;by the first day of Tishrey nature had resumed to function as&nbsp;usual, as we know from verse 13, this would suggest that&nbsp;during the preceding 60 days the water level had dropped&nbsp;precipitously, and there are certainly many mountains that&nbsp;are higher than 15 cubits, so that the water level must have&nbsp;receded by a whole cubit every four days, how could the ark&nbsp;still have been in eleven cubits of water?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We would have to answer that the (air surrounding mountains is measured by different yardsticks than the earth&nbsp;upon which they rise, so that all of the mountains and the&nbsp;waters surrounding them receded totally during those 60&nbsp;days. The waters in the airspace above the level of the&nbsp;mountains receded at a different rate of speed. Once the&nbsp;waters had dropped below the mountainous regions, they&nbsp;retreated at the rate of one cubit per day. The proof that this&nbsp;interpretation is true is the fact that we do not encounter the&nbsp;expression חסרון, diminution, reduction, when the Torah&nbsp;speaks of the mountain tops having become visible again.&nbsp;This teaches that a minor abatement of the waters was not&nbsp;deemed worthy of comment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> also comments: “if you were to interpret the word שביעי, “seventh month,” as referring to the month of Sivan, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">as&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">referring to the period during which the waters abated</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> how&nbsp;could you understand the line</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span class="font5"> “the ark came to rest in the&nbsp;seventh month of the cumulative abatement of the waters as&nbsp;occurring on the seventeenth of the month?” At that time the&nbsp;waters had not yet even stopped increasing in their&nbsp;inundation of the surface of the earth? We had already&nbsp;proved that the waters inundated progressively more parts of&nbsp;the earth commencing with the cessation of the rain for 150&nbsp;days! This day only concluded on the first day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan!</span><span class="font5"> This&nbsp;was </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">day when the deluge reached its crest! Every day&nbsp;thereafter was part of the recovery from the deluge.&nbsp;According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the relevant dates of the story of the&nbsp;deluge are as follows: “in the second month of the year. i.e.&nbsp;the month of Cheshvan, which according to the Talmud in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah</span><span class="font5"> 12 is the second month of the year, the&nbsp;deluge commenced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the compilation of a well known historical text relied upon by our sages, known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seder olam</span><span class="font5">, the&nbsp;sages accepted the view of Rabbi Eliezer concerning the&nbsp;Torah report of the deluge, whereas they accepted the view&nbsp;expressed by Rabbi Joshua, concerning the calculations of&nbsp;the seasons of the year. According to this view both the rains&nbsp;and the opening of subterranean wells commenced on the&nbsp;17<sup>th</sup> day of the month of Cheshvan, on the morning of that&nbsp;day. Both events continued until the morning of the 28<sup>th</sup> day&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev.</span><span class="font5"> At that point both rain and waters from&nbsp;subterranean parts of the globe ceased, but the inundation&nbsp;was felt as increasing until the ark‘s bottom was 15 cubits&nbsp;above the top of the highest mountain. As a result the ark&nbsp;kept on moving. The process of waters rising continued from&nbsp;the morning of the 28<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev</span><span class="font5"> until sundown on the first&nbsp;day of Sivan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was followed immediately by the verse: ויזכור אלוקים את נח, that G’d remembered Noach, etc. (8,1)&nbsp;revealing that as from that day on the waters receded at the&nbsp;end of 150 days. (verse 3) The ark running aground occurred&nbsp;7 days later on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of the seventh month, i.e. the 17<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan.(verse</span><span class="font5"> 3). It was the seventh month after the rains&nbsp;had commenced to fall. The waters kept receding after the&nbsp;rains had ceased (verse 5) from the first of Sivan until the&nbsp;month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Av,</span><span class="font5"> the tenth month after the rains had commenced&nbsp;descending on the earth. On the first day of the tenth month&nbsp;the tops of the highest mountains became visible. 40 days&nbsp;later on the tenth day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ellul,</span><span class="font5"> Noach opened the window of&nbsp;the ark and sent out the raven. The raven not having&nbsp;returned, Noach sent out the pigeon after having waited for&nbsp;seven days. (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi).</span><span class="font5"> The pigeon returned to the&nbsp;ark not having found a foothold outside of it. Noach waited&nbsp;another seven days before sending out the pigeon again.&nbsp;This time the pigeon returned on the evening of the same&nbsp;day carrying part of an olive leaf in its beak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators believe that this leaf came from Mount Olives in the land of Israel. (Rabbi Levi in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit&nbsp;Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 33,6 according to the view that the rains did not&nbsp;flood the soil of the Land of Israel) The Scriptural basis for&nbsp;this view is found in Ezekiel 22,24: לא גושמה ביום זעם, “which&nbsp;was not rained upon on the day of anger.” Noach then waited&nbsp;for another seven days before dispatching a pigeon a third&nbsp;time. That time the pigeon did not return to the ark.&nbsp;Immediately after this, the Torah reports, (8,13) that the&nbsp;waters on earth had dried as of the first day of the month of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey</span><span class="font5"> in the 601<sup>st</sup> year of Noach’s life. Finally, on the 27<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cheshvan,</span><span class="font5"> (57 days later) the soil was dry enough for&nbsp;man and beast to walk on without sinking into mud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators wonder what forced </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> to state that the words: “it was at the end of forty days,” in 8,6 refer to&nbsp;40 days after the tops of the mountains had become visible.&nbsp;If correct, why would the pigeon not have found a foothold on&nbsp;earth then? After all, 47 days had elapsed since that time&nbsp;before Noach sent out the pigeon. Some commentators&nbsp;dismiss this argument saying that since no actual land&nbsp;surfaces were visible, the pigeon did not find a suitable place&nbsp;to rest. We may assume that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> accepted the report of&nbsp;the Torah as following events chronologically so that the date&nbsp;on which the pigeon finally decided to remain outside the ark&nbsp;was on the first of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey</span><span class="font5"> when the surface of the earth&nbsp;appeared dry, [capable of supporting the weight of a little&nbsp;bird. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators begin the count of 150 days from the first day the rains had commenced, i.e. from the 17<sup>th</sup> day&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cheshvan.</span><span class="font5"> Those days accordingly would include the 40&nbsp;days of incessant rainfall. They consider the seventh month,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Iyar</span><span class="font5"> as already a month during which the waters receded,&nbsp;just as we consider the tenth month as the month during&nbsp;which the waters receded. Their interpretation of the Torah’s&nbsp;report, commencing with 8,18: “the waters grew more&nbsp;powerful,” is thus: starting with the 17<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cheshvan</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;water level on earth kept rising for a continuous 150 days&nbsp;culminating on the 20<sup>th</sup> day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan.</span><span class="font5"> On that day the tide&nbsp;was turned and the waters began to recede. The ark came to&nbsp;rest on Mount Arrarat in the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Iyar,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. the seventh&nbsp;month during which the waters were receding, on the 17<sup>th</sup> of&nbsp;that month. The waters continued to recede until the tenth&nbsp;month continuously, and during the tenth month of their&nbsp;retreat on the on the first of that month the tops of the tallest&nbsp;mountains became visible. The 15 cubits of water which had&nbsp;covered the tallest mountains for 95 days, between the 20<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>of Nissan until the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Av, had retreated at the rate of 1&nbsp;cubit every 6 and a half days between the 20<sup>th</sup> of Nissan and&nbsp;the 16<sup>th</sup> day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Iyar,</span><span class="font5"> whereas the 11 cubits of the ark which&nbsp;were beneath the water level, retreated during the 7 days&nbsp;between the 17<sup>th</sup> of Iyar and the 1<sup>st</sup> day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Av, at</span><span class="font5"> the rate of&nbsp;one cubit every 6 and a half days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators explain the conclusion of this section in accordance with what we have learned in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Seder&nbsp;Olam,</span><span class="font5"> which addresses the meaning of the paragraph&nbsp;commencing with: “it was at the end of 40 days (8,6)” as&nbsp;referring to 40 days which commenced with the first day in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan</span><span class="font5"> and concluded on the 10<sup>th</sup> day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tammuz.</span><span class="font5"> According&nbsp;to that calculation, Noach immediately opened the window of&nbsp;the ark on that day and dispatched the raven. He then waited&nbsp;for seven days before dispatching the pigeon. He waited&nbsp;another seven days before dispatching the pigeon again. The&nbsp;reason why the pigeon on that occasion did not return was&nbsp;that it had found room on a top of a mountain that had been&nbsp;revealed in the meantime. The day under discussion was the&nbsp;first day of the month of Av, as already mentioned, seeing&nbsp;that the Torah had written that the tops of the mountains&nbsp;became visible on the first of the tenth month (8,5). </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Av</span><span class="font5"> is the&nbsp;tenth month of the year if the month during which the deluge&nbsp;started is considered as the “first month.” According to this&nbsp;method of counting, any part of a month is considered as if it&nbsp;were a full month. On the other hand, the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Elul</span><span class="font5"> is&nbsp;never considered as the tenth month following </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kislev</span><span class="font5"> during&nbsp;which the rains ceased, for if so, why when Noach&nbsp;dispatched a bird a third time would the pigeon not have&nbsp;returned to the ark seeing that according the calculation the&nbsp;tops of the mountains had not yet reappeared until the first of&nbsp;the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Elul?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do not query the verse commencing with the words: והמים הלוך וחסור, “and the waters continued to diminish,” (8,5)&nbsp;by asking by what yardstick Noach decided on when to&nbsp;dispatch another bird, this is no problem for once the process&nbsp;of waters receding had commenced until the ark had come to&nbsp;rest on Mount Arrarat, Noach could confidently expect that&nbsp;with the passage of another week the chances of land&nbsp;appearing had increased. Between the first day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Av</span><span class="font5"> and the&nbsp;until the first day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey</span><span class="font5"> all the waters remaining from the&nbsp;deluge had been absorbed by the earth, and by the 27<sup>th</sup> of&nbsp;the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cheshvan</span><span class="font5"> the earth had become dry enough to&nbsp;walk on and to build on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,7. וישלח את העורב</span><span class="font5">, “he dispatched the raven;” the reason Noach chose one of the impure birds for this mission,&nbsp;[although he could have chosen a pigeon of which he had&nbsp;seven pairs, Ed.] was that since that bird feeds on carcasses,&nbsp;the chances that it would find something to eat were far&nbsp;greater than if he had sent a pigeon which is more&nbsp;circumspect in what it chooses as its food. Do not question&nbsp;how Noach could have dispatched any creature from the ark&nbsp;seeing that at that time it was totally dark outside? While it is&nbsp;true that there was no sunshine or moonlight, and the light of&nbsp;the stars is insufficient to know thereby whether it is day or&nbsp;night, there was some light, as we know from when the&nbsp;Torah wrote in verse 5 that the mountain tops had become&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">visible </span><span class="font5">at the beginning of the tenth month. Furthermore,&nbsp;there is an opinion cited in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 33,5, according&nbsp;to which light of sun and moon was usable, but was not&nbsp;usable by Noach for astronomical calculations. Unless this&nbsp;was so, how would Noach have been able to tell day from&nbsp;night?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצא יצוא ושוב</span><span class="font5">, “it kept going back and forth;” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 108 claims that the raven&nbsp;accused Noach with an ironclad argument of hating it, else&nbsp;he would have used a bird of which there were seven&nbsp;species rather than endanger the species of the raven of&nbsp;which he had only a single pair. As a result, the raven did not&nbsp;fly far away from the ark to ensure it would find its way back,&nbsp;and could protect its mate if need be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,8. </span><span class="font5">וישלח</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“he sent it off on a one way trip;” the dot in&nbsp;the letter ל is the proof that this is the correct interpretation.&nbsp;When someone is dispatched in order to report back, that&nbsp;letter never appears with such a dot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,11. וידע נח כי קלו המים</span><span class="font5">, “then Noach knew that the waters had subsided substantially. The fact that the pigeon&nbsp;stayed out all day long convinced Noach that there was what&nbsp;to look at other than mere water. According to the view that&nbsp;the deluge did not affect the land of Israel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Zevachim</span><span class="font5"> 113)&nbsp;how could Noach have known from the torn olive leaf that the&nbsp;waters had indeed subsided so much? He could have&nbsp;deduced that this leaf had originated in the Holy Land, or it&nbsp;had been picked up floating on the surface of the waters?&nbsp;The word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חטף </span><span class="font5">used by the Torah here, always is used in&nbsp;connection with something that has been plucked from a&nbsp;tree. If it had been picked up floating, it would have been a&nbsp;whole leaf, and would not have shown signs of having been&nbsp;picked from its branch. The translation by Yonathan ben&nbsp;Uzziel is further proof of this. He translates: נחית, i.e. plucked&nbsp;by mouth or beak. [The Hebrew equivalent of when Yaakov&nbsp;mourned his son Joseph as having been torn to shreds by a&nbsp;wild beast, טרף טרף יוסף, Genesis 37,33.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,13. ויהי באחת ושש מאות שנה בראשון באחד לחודש. </span><span class="font5">It was in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the 601<sup>st</sup> year (of Noach’s life) on the first day of the first month; even a single day of a new year is referred to as the&nbsp;year just commencing.” (Compare Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation of the significance of this statement: in the 600<sup>th</sup> year of Noach’s life in the month of&nbsp;Iyar on the 17<sup>th</sup> of the month the deluge had commenced,&nbsp;and the rain lasted for 40 days and 40 nights, so that the&nbsp;rains ceased by the 28<sup>th</sup> day of Sivan. According to this&nbsp;interpretation the first month of the year is the month of&nbsp;Nissan. All the other months follow the same patterns&nbsp;according to the solar calendar. Each month is considered as&nbsp;having thirty days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'חמש עשרה אמה מלמעלה גברו המים וגו</span><span class="font5">. This verse teaches us, using our intellect, that the ark could not have been&nbsp;submerged in the waters to an extent of more than six cubits.&nbsp;How do we arrive at this conclusion? The water level on&nbsp;earth has been described as at its highest level being 15&nbsp;cubits above the top of the highest mountain. This level had&nbsp;been attained during the 7 days from the 17<sup>th</sup> day in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">in which the ark ran aground on Mount Arrarat. By the first&nbsp;day in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tevet,</span><span class="font5"> the highest mountain tops became visible</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font5"> It&nbsp;was then easy to determine the level at which the ark had&nbsp;been waterlogged prior to having run aground. The water&nbsp;leaves marks on the outside that can easily be distinguished.&nbsp;The inhabitants of the ark were therefore able to calculate&nbsp;that the speed at which the waters had been receding was&nbsp;one cubit for each 12 days. Having arrived at this calculation&nbsp;they had to count another 180 days from the 28<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;day on which the rains had ceased. They were therefore able&nbsp;to calculate that at its highest point the waters had been 15&nbsp;cubits above the highest mountain. [There is a very minor&nbsp;discrepancy, a few centimeters when allowing for 2 days not&nbsp;included in the above count. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויגברו המים על הארץ חמשים ומאת יום</span><span class="font5">, “the waters kept rising above the earth for a period of 150 days.” The Torah&nbsp;reconstructs Noach’s calculations based on the waters not&nbsp;having started to recede until the ark had run aground on&nbsp;Mount Arrarat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In actual fact, however, the waters had commenced to recede already since the twenty eighth day in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan,</span><span class="font5"> as&nbsp;testified to by the Torah (8,2-3). [The line about the rain&nbsp;having disappeared from the skies, (verse 2) and the&nbsp;immediately following report about the receding of the waters&nbsp;is extremely puzzling when compared to 7,12. No wonder the&nbsp;commentators had difficulty with this. In order to remove&nbsp;apparent contradictions the two reports have to be&nbsp;understood as: 1) objective report by the Torah; 2) subjective&nbsp;report as seen by the inhabitants of the ark, [who were&nbsp;somewhat limited in their observations. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the ark ran aground on the 17 day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey,</span><span class="font5"> on the first day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tevet,</span><span class="font5"> the tops of the mountains became&nbsp;visible. Forty days after that, on the eleventh day of the&nbsp;month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’vat,</span><span class="font5"> Noach opened the window of the ark and&nbsp;sent out the raven. Seven days thereafter as explained by&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> on the 18<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’vat,</span><span class="font5"> he sent out the pigeon, i.e. on&nbsp;the 25<sup>th</sup> of that month. He waited another seven days until&nbsp;the second day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Adar</span><span class="font5"> and sent out the pigeon again, but&nbsp;this time the pigeon did not return. He remained inside the&nbsp;ark for another 28 days, until the first day of Nissan. This is&nbsp;what the Torah meant when it wrote: “It was on the first day&nbsp;of the 601<sup>st</sup> year on the first day of the month when Noach&nbsp;removed the cover from the ark and found that the waters on&nbsp;the surface of the earth had dried.” At the same time he&nbsp;noted that the earth’s surface was still muddy and not fit to&nbsp;be walked on. It took another 57 days until the 27<sup>th</sup> day of&nbsp;lyar before Noach saw that the earth was absolutely dry&nbsp;whereupon G’d commanded him to exit the ark. (verse 15).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וידבר אלוקים אל נח לאמור</span><span class="font5">, “G’d spoke to Noach for&nbsp;him to tell the members of his family;” this apparently&nbsp;repetitive statement is customary in the Torah; compare&nbsp;Exodus 6,10, or even more definitively, Leviticus 11,1;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.16. צא מן התיבה אתה ואשתך</span><span class="font5">, “leave the ark, you and your wife, etc;” when you check the text you will find that&nbsp;Noach did not follow G’d’s instructions precisely, as in verse&nbsp;18 the Torah reports that Noach did not leave the ark at the&nbsp;same time as his wife, but he left in the company of his sons.&nbsp;According to an argument between Rabbi Nechemyah and&nbsp;Rabbi Yehudah, according to one Noach was punished for&nbsp;not taking advantage of living with his wife again immediately&nbsp;and siring more children by being debased and castrated in&nbsp;his wife’s tent. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 35,1) The other Rabbi&nbsp;disagrees, claiming that he was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">rewarded</span><span class="font5">, seeing that he&nbsp;proved more chaste than even commanded, by not&nbsp;immediately indulging in sex with his wife so that G’d spoke&nbsp;to both him and his children in 9,1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">הוצא</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> אתך</span><span class="font5">, this word is to be read as if it had been&nbsp;spelled: “היצא!” “Take out!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויצא נח ובניו</span><span class="font5">, “Noach and his sons left the ark, etc.”&nbsp;Some commentators claim that although marital relations&nbsp;between the sexes had been permitted again, the manner in&nbsp;which the Torah writes the males exiting from the ark as if in&nbsp;a group is revealing. On the other hand, the Talmud in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 108 states that there were three creatures which&nbsp;violated the prohibition of sexual relations during their stay in&nbsp;the ark: the dog, the raven and Noach’s son Cham. All of&nbsp;them were punished for their misconduct. The dog is tied by&nbsp;a chain or leash to its owner. The raven is forced to spit after&nbsp;indulging in mating, and Cham’s skin, or that of his offspring,&nbsp;turned black.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויעל עולות, </span><span class="font5">“he offered burnt offerings.” He acted&nbsp;similar to the sailors in the story of Jonah, who after having&nbsp;been saved from a great storm and returned to dry land,&nbsp;immediately offered offerings to G’d for their deliverance.&nbsp;(Jonah 2,16). We learn from here that anyone who has been&nbsp;miraculously saved from dangers beyond his control is&nbsp;expected to offer tangible thanksgiving offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במזבח, </span><span class="font5">“on the altar.” This is a reference to the altar on which Kayin and Hevel had presented their respective&nbsp;offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר ה' אל לבו</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord said to Himself, etc.,”&nbsp;Prior to the deluge (Genesis 6,6) the Lord had seen fit to feel&nbsp;saddened in His heart; now He felt greatly encouraged about&nbsp;the human species He had created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Noach could have drawn comparisons between the chaos he faced in spite of having lived a blameless life for&nbsp;600 years, with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gan Eden</span><span class="font5"> into which Adam had been&nbsp;placed </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> his having done anything to merit this.&nbsp;Instead, he was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">grateful</span><span class="font5">. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא אוסיף</span><span class="font5">, “I will not continue, etc;” according to the plain meaning of the text, i.e. the additional, apparently&nbsp;superfluous word: עוד, again, further, the first word refers to&nbsp;the earth, whereas the second word refers to the living&nbsp;creatures on it. If we needed proof of this, it can be found in&nbsp;Genesis 9,12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יצר לב האדם רע מנעוריו</span><span class="font5">, “because the tendencies of man’s heart are evil from his youth already.” Man’s&nbsp;immaturity in his younger years is the reason for these evil&nbsp;inclinations. G’d therefore had decided not to visit&nbsp;punishments on man promptly as a result this consideration&nbsp;as He used to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,22. עוד כל ימי הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “as long as earth exists, etc;” our author understands these words as parallel to Isaiah 51,6: כי&nbsp;שמים כעשן נמלחו והארץ כבגד תבלה, “for the heavens should melt&nbsp;way like smoke and the earth wear out like a garment.” In&nbsp;other words, the covenant now concluded with mankind is&nbsp;not eternal, but subject to the same conditions as the&nbsp;duration of the material universe as we know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands the whole verse as describing the seasons of the year which will repeat regularly, [limited, of&nbsp;course to our northern hemisphere. Ed.] two months for each&nbsp;season, but they do not coincide with the beginning of the&nbsp;lunar months but run from the middle of the month&nbsp;approximately. This subject is dwelt on in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Metzia,</span><span class="font5"> 106.&nbsp;If you were to counter that in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;Talmud does not appear to match what is written here, as the&nbsp;year is described as the seasons being described as&nbsp;contrasting each other, i.e. cold season versus hot season,&nbsp;etc; it is possible that the version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> that we have is&nbsp;faulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,3. כירק עשב</span><span class="font5">, “as if it were green grass.” Such grass had been permitted for man to eat ever since his creation.&nbsp;Just as some grass had </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">never </span><span class="font5">been fit to eat,-though not&nbsp;forbidden,-so some living creatures as well as fish and fowl&nbsp;would be permitted as food, whereas others would not&nbsp;because they are not suitable as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נתתי לכם את כל</span><span class="font5">, “I have allocated it all to you in a similar manner.” The reason why G’d permitted eating living&nbsp;creatures after they had been killed, was that all of them had&nbsp;to thank man for having kept them from perishing during the&nbsp;deluge. As a result, all the animals were now totally at the&nbsp;mercy of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אך בשר בנפשו דמו לא תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “you must not however&nbsp;eat meat with its life-blood in it.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this is&nbsp;the prohibition of eating any part of an animal as long as the&nbsp;animal itself is still alive. Seeing that the Torah now permitted&nbsp;man to eat all manner of moving creatures, the Torah now&nbsp;had to forbid eating parts of animals such as ribs, which had&nbsp;been cut off the living animal. Seeing that Adam had never&nbsp;been permitted to even eat a carcass, he had not been&nbsp;forbidden eating live tissue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואך את דמכם</span><span class="font5">, “yet your (human) blood”, etc; this is a&nbsp;warning to any animal not to kill any human being, as G’d&nbsp;would hold it responsible for harming humans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains the verse as follows: the peculiar wording is to include killing, including suicide that does not&nbsp;involve the actual shedding of blood, such as by&nbsp;strangulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לנפשותיכם</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this refers to people who strangulate themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The passage is intended as an answer to people who deny that G’d operates </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis a vis</span><span class="font5"> man through a system of&nbsp;reward and punishment, i.e. reward </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> the body has died&nbsp;and punishment </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> the body has died, and who therefore&nbsp;see in suicide a way of avoiding being held responsible for&nbsp;their actions on earth. Clearly a system of reward and&nbsp;punishment, unless it included posthumous reward and&nbsp;punishment, would be meaningless, and would not act as&nbsp;deterrent not to sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah,</span><span class="font5"> 34,13 the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אך </span><span class="font5">in our verse is understood as including the mortally wounded King Sha-ul&nbsp;who completed dying by falling intentionally on his own&nbsp;sword to escape being killed by the Philistines whom he did&nbsp;not want to be able to claim that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> had killed G’d’s&nbsp;anointed king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Others believe that it applies to Chananyah, Mishael and Azaryah, who had consulted with the prophet Ezekiel&nbsp;before submitting to being thrown to the lions by&nbsp;Nevuchadnezar. Some authorities do not agree that they&nbsp;were permitted to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מיד כל חיה אדרשנו</span><span class="font5">, “I will demand an accounting from every living creature for having shed it.” This is meant to&nbsp;prevent man from using animals to kill his foes, claiming that&nbsp;he had not killed anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of this phrase: “I, G’d, will demand an accounting directly from the animal concerned.&nbsp;Compare Exodus 21,29 where not only the owner of the ox&nbsp;who gored is to be stoned but also the ox itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מיד איש אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “of every man of that of his fellow man;” man must not conclude that seeing that all the beasts have&nbsp;become permitted as food (after death of the animal) so&nbsp;human carcasses have also been permitted to him as food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אדרוש</span><span class="font5">, “I will demand an accounting even of anyone killing himself, or who kills a fellow human being in the&nbsp;absence of witnesses who could bring him to justice before a&nbsp;human tribunal.” Open murder must, of course, be dealt with&nbsp;by human tribunals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;באדם דמו ישפך, </span><span class="font5">“his blood will be spilled by a fellow&nbsp;human being.” Here the Torah revealed the penalty for&nbsp;murder. Where had it issued the warning not to commit&nbsp;murder? This is found in Exodus 20,13: לא תרצח, “do not&nbsp;commit murder!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי בצלם אלוקים, </span><span class="font5">the meaning of the word: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font5"> here is the same as the meaning of that word in Exodus 22,27,&nbsp;where it means that one must not curse a judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עשה את האדם</span><span class="font5">, He appointed man on earth to be judge so that fellow man would be deterred from committing sins and&nbsp;crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואתם פרו ורבו</span><span class="font5">, “as for you, be fruitful and multiply!” I&nbsp;G’d, do not wish that you diminish in numbers but that you&nbsp;increase in numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: if you follow My instructions to deal sternly with murderers, I will in turn insure that you&nbsp;will increase in numbers, [although you might have to&nbsp;execute the odd murderer in your midst. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third possible interpretation: This blessing appears here twice, once (verse 1) for the human race and once for&nbsp;the animal kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,9. ואני הנני</span><span class="font5">, “and as far as I am concerned, etc;”&nbsp;according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this is G’d’s way of saying that He&nbsp;agreed with Noach who had not wanted to resume normal&nbsp;marital relations until specifically encouraged by G’d to do so.&nbsp;He waited for G’d’s promise not ever again to bring on the&nbsp;kind of destruction of the human race that he had just been a&nbsp;witness to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,11. והקימותי את בריתי, </span><span class="font5">“I shall maintain My covenant as applicable, etc.” The reason why G’d’s promise not to bring&nbsp;on another deluge is repeated in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> verse, is to&nbsp;underline that even if the human race would again be guilty&nbsp;of similar conduct to that which had brought about the&nbsp;deluge, this covenant would not be considered by G’d as null&nbsp;and void.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,13. את קשתי, </span><span class="font5">My rainbow, etc;” the rainbow is&nbsp;considered as a very significant visible sign directly from the&nbsp;celestial regions. If we needed proof for this, the reader is</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">referred to Ezekiel 1,28: 'כן מראה דמות כבוד ה.........כמראה הקשת,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“just as the appearance of the rainbow.....so is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">appearance of the semblance of the glory of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If it were My intention to destroy you when the rains intensified in quality and quantity, I would not first show you a&nbsp;semblance of My glory, just as it is not the custom of a mortal&nbsp;king to show himself amongst his subjects when he is angry&nbsp;at them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different approach to this subject of the rainbow: just as the rainbow does not change its consistency although it&nbsp;reflects both water and fire and provides a greater variety of&nbsp;light than any other phenomenon at the same time, and&nbsp;water and fire do not act as mutually destructive as they do in&nbsp;nature normally, so its very appearance is a reassurance that&nbsp;rain will never again be the precursor to the destruction of the&nbsp;human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third interpretation: normally a hunter when aiming the bow (and arrow) aims it inclined upwards, or at least&nbsp;horizontally; the fact that this bow is inclined downwards is&nbsp;proof that it is not the bow used by an antagonist bent on&nbsp;destroying his foe. [For a further study on the significance of&nbsp;the rainbow, and the changes it reflects in cosmic conditions&nbsp;after the deluge, the reader is referred to the commentary by</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Elie Munk, in his “The call of the Torah,” Feldheim Publishing. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,14. ונראתה הקשת, </span><span class="font5">“when the rainbow becomes visible;” the fact that the bow appears without arrows appearing at the&nbsp;same time, is to serve as reassurance to the beholder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,18. וח</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא אבי כנען </span><span class="font5">“and Cham is the one who is Canaan’s father.” He is singled out for mention as he was&nbsp;conceived while his parents were still in the ark. He was born&nbsp;immediately after his parents left the ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;איש האדמה</span><span class="font5">, a man to whom (and to his children)&nbsp;the earth had been given after the deluge, after the curse&nbsp;that had rested upon it had been removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויטע כר</span><span class="font5">ם, “he planted a vineyard.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi, </span><span class="font5">Noach had taken branches of the fig tree and the grapevine&nbsp;with him into the ark. (based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 36,3) These&nbsp;plants are especially sensitive to water and need protecting&nbsp;more than other trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternate interpretation: both of these seeds need especial attention in order to be planted successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.21, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתגל בתוך אהלה</span><span class="font5">, “he had disrobed inside his tent.”&nbsp;According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> basing himself on a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,&nbsp;(Tanchuma,</span><span class="font5"> edition Buber) the correct interpretation, seeing&nbsp;that the last letter in the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">אהלה</span><span class="font5"> is the letter ה instead of ו&nbsp;this is a hint of the exile of the Tent Tribes, who, according to&nbsp;some prophets, were guilty of too much wine drinking. (Amos&nbsp;6,1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,22. ויגד לשני אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “he told his two brothers of this.” Since the Torah did not use the word: ויאמר, for Cham telling&nbsp;his brothers, but ויגד, “he elaborated on this,” it is clear that&nbsp;he emphasised that his father had embarrassed himself.&nbsp;According to Rabbi Yaakov bar Zivdi in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 36,5&nbsp;the reason why a Canaanite slave is released immediately&nbsp;when his owner has ruined a tooth of his or an eye of his&nbsp;(Exodus 21,26), is because the eye is used to see things that&nbsp;should not be seen, and the tooth (mouth) is used to tell what&nbsp;should not be told. [Once the limb of a Canaanite’s slave&nbsp;whose </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">forefather</span><span class="font5"> had abused it has been ruined, that curse&nbsp;has been removed from him .Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקח ש</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויפת</span><span class="font5">, “Shem and Yephet took the bed-cloth, etc;“ according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Shem’s initiative in this&nbsp;instance resulted in the Jewish people, a nation descended&nbsp;from him, being rewarded with the commandment to wear&nbsp;fringes, ציציות on four-cornered garments. (Numbers 15,37)&nbsp;According to the statement in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> 17, the&nbsp;origin of that commandment had been when Avraham&nbsp;refused to accept as much as a thread or shoelace from the&nbsp;loot of the war against Kedorlo-omer, (Genesis 15,23) this&nbsp;refers to the specific kind of “threads” used in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzitzit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר עשה לו בנו הקטן </span><span class="font5">, “what his youngest son had&nbsp;done for him;” a reference to the kind deed done by Shem&nbsp;and his brother Yephet. This is why he gave Shem a greater&nbsp;blessing than the one he gave to Yephet his older brother. [a&nbsp;totally different interpretation from the commonly accepted&nbsp;one, including </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר ארור כנען, </span><span class="font5">He said: “cursed be Canaan, etc.”&nbsp;Concerning Canaan, the prophet Yoel said (Yoel,4,8) “and&nbsp;they will sell them to the people of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’va,</span><span class="font5"> to a far distant&nbsp;nation.” The slaves will in turn sell the Canaanites to an even&nbsp;more degrading status.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארור כנען</span><span class="font5">, Cham sinned and his son Canaan was punished. Why? Seeing that G’d had already blessed Noach&nbsp;and all of his sons, Noach’s cursing Cham would have been&nbsp;totally ineffective. [Compare what G’d said to Bileam when&nbsp;He told him that seeing that the Jewish people had already&nbsp;been blessed by Him, he, Bileam, could not undo this by&nbsp;cursing them. (Numbers 22,12) Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators say that actually Cham had not done anything; he had only viewed the exposed body of his&nbsp;father, and had failed to cover him as did his brothers&nbsp;subsequently. However, he had told others about it </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">intending to cover his father. Had he intended to cover his&nbsp;father, why did he tell his brothers about what he had seen&nbsp;without at least first having covered his father’s shame? This&nbsp;is why Noach cursed him when he found out. These&nbsp;commentators cite the line: “what his younger son had done&nbsp;to him,” as proof for their interpretation. (Since the son’s&nbsp;name had already been mentioned at the beginning of the&nbsp;paragraph, there was no need to repeat it.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word: הקטן does not refer to the youngest son of Noach seeing that Cham was not Noach’s youngest son, the&nbsp;eldest being Yephet and the youngest being Shem, as&nbsp;already pointed out earlier. Noach blessed the two sons who&nbsp;had treated him as was proper, whereas he remained silent&nbsp;concerning Cham. Canaan who had shamed him, he cursed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארור כנען</span><span class="font5">, “cursed be Canaan,” he cursed him by referring to his name, meaning that his very name which&nbsp;indicated something negative, suppressed, downtrodden,&nbsp;should become his curse. He would become subservient to&nbsp;his brothers. Whenever a servant does not carry out the&nbsp;wishes of his master he attracts a curse to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עבד עבדים יהיה, </span><span class="font5">“he will become a slave to slaves.” His fate will not be determined by warfare, but when the Jewish&nbsp;people would conquer the land of Canaan, they would be&nbsp;instructed not to let any Canaanite survive on that land.&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 20,16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.26. ברוך ה' אלוקי שם</span><span class="font5">, “Blessed be the Lord, G’d of Shem;” Noach blessed his G’d Who had also proven to be&nbsp;the G’d of his son Shem who served no other deity; being a&nbsp;servant of the Lord is being truly free, as opposed to Canaan,&nbsp;who was cursed to be truly subservient even to slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהי כנען עבד למו</span><span class="font5">, “whereas Canaan will be a slave to them.” He will be a slave both to Shem and to His G’d. He&nbsp;will be a slave to the Lord by having to carry water and&nbsp;kindling for the altar when the descendants of Shem would&nbsp;offer sacrifices to their Lord. [This is a reference to the&nbsp;Gibeonites, a Canaanite tribe who had duped Joshua into&nbsp;accepting them as converts. (Joshua chapter 9) Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יפת</span><span class="font5">, “May He expand;” Noach did not use the&nbsp;name of the Lord additionally when blessing Yephet as he&nbsp;had done in connection with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shem’s</span><span class="font5"> blessing, as the latter&nbsp;was a righteous person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,29. ויהי כל ימי נח תשע מאות שנה וחמישים שנה וימת, </span><span class="font5">“When&nbsp;Noach had reached the age of 950 years, he died.” You&nbsp;might ask that seeing we already know that Noach lived to&nbsp;become 950 years old, as the Torah had told us this in 7,11&nbsp;and in the verse immediately preceding this one, so why did&nbsp;the Torah have to write this verse? The fact is that we might&nbsp;have added 7,11 and 9,28, and have arrived at the&nbsp;erroneous conclusion that Noach had lived 951 years. The&nbsp;Torah wished to inform us that the year in the ark was not&nbsp;considered as one of the years that Noach had “lived;” The&nbsp;author had already referred to that fact in chapter 9, verse 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ובני גומר וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and the descendants of Gomer, etc;”&nbsp;the reason why the Torah does not mention by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">name</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;sons of Magog, Modai, Tuval Kayin, etc., is because none of&nbsp;them became founders of nations, so that only a single one&nbsp;of them became a founder of a nation. The same pattern is&nbsp;applied by the Torah when describing the offspring of Put&nbsp;son of Cham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כמים וח־נים</span><span class="font5">; elsewhere the דדנים are called רודנים.&nbsp;(Compare Chronicles I 1,7) This is to teach us that at times in&nbsp;history when the fortunes of the Jewish people as r&nbsp;ascending, these people treat us a “cousins,” in order to&nbsp;benefit from this biological relationship. When the fortunes of&nbsp;the Jewish people’s fortunes are on the decline, these&nbsp;“cousins,” are the first to join those who persecute us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכוש ילד את נמרוד</span><span class="font5">, “and Cush sired Nimrod.” The&nbsp;reason why Nimrod has not been enumerated together with&nbsp;his other brothers is to draw attention to his&nbsp;accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,הוא החל להיות גבור </span><span class="font5">“he began to be outstanding amongst the people who had survived the deluge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'גבור ציד לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “a great hunter before the Lord, i.e.&nbsp;throughout the earth. “ We find a similar use of the&nbsp;expression when in the Book of Jonah (Jonah 3,3) the city of&nbsp;Nineveh is described as עיר גדולה לאלוקים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“a great city before&nbsp;G’d,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">” </span><span class="font5">where the expression means that on the whole globe&nbsp;there was no city comparable in size of population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the expression: 'לפני ה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font5">“as predicted in the name of the Lord.” Compare: Joshua 6,26&nbsp;where Joshua predicts that anyone who would dare to&nbsp;rebuild the city of Jericho would pay the price in the eyes of&nbsp;G’d by losing his oldest son when commencing that&nbsp;enterprise, and that he would wind up by losing his last son&nbsp;by the time he would affix the gates to the city wall. His&nbsp;prediction came true in the time of the prophet Elijah when a&nbsp;man by the name of Chiel son of Eli, did exactly this, and&nbsp;wound up by losing all his sons in that order. (Kings I 16,34.)&nbsp;The Torah tells us that G’d decreed that a person of the type&nbsp;of Nimrod had to arise in order for Avraham to demonstrate&nbsp;that one could prevail even against such mighty warriors who&nbsp;defied the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על כן יאמר כנמרוד</span><span class="font5">, “this is why people would use Nimrod as an example, saying: ‘just like Nimrod, a mighty hunter by&nbsp;the grace of the Lord.’” According to tradition no ferocious&nbsp;beast ever escaped alive in an encounter with Nimrod. He&nbsp;was aided by G’d in attaining such a reputation so that G’d&nbsp;could demonstrate in due course that such apparently&nbsp;invincible warriors could not prevail against Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ותהי ראשית ממלכתו וגו</span><span class="font5">, “at the beginning his&nbsp;kingdom extended only to Babylonia and Accadia, extending&nbsp;eventually throughout the whole region of Shinor. Eventually&nbsp;he even conquered the region of Ashur. (north-east) Ashur&nbsp;had emigrated as he could not stand Nimrod’s anti-G’d&nbsp;attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשור</span><span class="font5">, as if the Torah had written: לאשור, “to&nbsp;Ashur.” [According to this interpretation Ashur here was not&nbsp;the name of a person but of the city he had founded. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת רסן בין נינוה </span><span class="font5">, “and the great city of Nineveh&nbsp;situated between </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ressen</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kolach”.</span><span class="font5"> He linked all three&nbsp;cities into one great metropolis. This is the reason why&nbsp;subsequently we find Nineveh referred to as: “the great city.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the phrase: “and from this land Ashur emigrated.” The word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ashur</span><span class="font5"> is the name of a&nbsp;man, as suggested by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> who described </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ashur</span><span class="font5"> as being&nbsp;disgusted with his own children acclaiming Nimrod as deity,&nbsp;so much so that he decided to move far north east.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5">, the source of which our author does not quote, the question is raised why G’d appointed a special&nbsp;prophet to warn the city of Nineveh of impending destruction&nbsp;if its people did not mend its ways. The answer given is that&nbsp;that this was in recognition of the courageous conduct of its&nbsp;founder </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ashur,</span><span class="font5"> who had dissociated himself from Nimrod’s&nbsp;pantheistic kingdom. That </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> cites our verse as the&nbsp;source for G’d’s special consideration for Nineveh’s people.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> interprets the words: מן הארץ ההיא יצא אשור, as if&nbsp;the Torah had written: ‘the plan that prompted </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ashur</span><span class="font5"> to move&nbsp;far away from the domain of Ni rod, eventually paid dividends&nbsp;by the inhabitants of their capital being given 40 days during&nbsp;which to reform heir lifestyle.” In Psalms 83,9, we are told&nbsp;that eventually also the Kingdom of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ashur</span><span class="font5"> turned anti Israel,&nbsp;as when they conquered the territories of the northern&nbsp;kingdom of the ten tribes and exiled its inhabitants in 722 B.C&nbsp;and that is why the Babylonians not long afterwards&nbsp;conquered the Kingdom of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ashur</span><span class="font5"> that had been predominant&nbsp;in that region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish explains that the error made by the people of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ashur</span><span class="font5"> was that they thought the family of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Put</span><span class="font5"> (verse 7) had become extinct, until we find in the Book of&nbsp;Ezekiel 30,5 that “both </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Put, Lud,</span><span class="font5"> and a mixed multitude of&nbsp;non pure ancestry,” is mentioned by the prophet as among&nbsp;the nations falling victim to conquerors together with the&nbsp;Egyptians whom they had supported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason that these details have not been spelled out in the Torah is that if you enumerate all these tribes we&nbsp;would think that there had been more than the 70 nations of&nbsp;which the Torah speaks after the fall of the Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,15. וכנען ילד את צידון</span><span class="font5">, “Canaan sired Tzidon;” Canaan sired a total of 11 sons. After having listed all their names,&nbsp;the Torah continues with describing how they dispersed over&nbsp;different regions, and that one of them split into two nations,&nbsp;thus making a total of 12 Canaanite tribes. This is&nbsp;comparable in Jewish history to the tribe of Joseph being&nbsp;made up of Menashe and Ephrayim, who on most occasions&nbsp;appear independently whenever the tribe of Levi is not&nbsp;included in the count of the Jewish tribes. Moses refers only&nbsp;to seven Canaanite tribes; the six which were historically&nbsp;significant he names separately, attributing their genealogy&nbsp;to their founding father Canaan. The reason why they&nbsp;deserved this honorable mention is that when the brothers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">took their father Yaakov to be buried in the cave of Machpelah, these Canaanite kings all paid honour to Yaakov&nbsp;the descendant of Avraham. (Genesis 50,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,19. 'ויהי גבול הכנעני וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and the boundaries of the territory ruled over by the Canaanite were, etc.” The details&nbsp;by the Torah provided here are exceptional, and are listed&nbsp;only because in the future the Israelites would inherit the&nbsp;lands owned by the Canaanites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,21. 'ולשם יולד וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and for Shem were born, etc.” In these verses (2-21) the three sons are listed in the order of&nbsp;their ages. As to the reference to Yephet as the הגדול, “the&nbsp;big one,” this adjective was used here to ensure that we&nbsp;realise that he was the oldest. If his other brothers were&nbsp;sometimes mentioned ahead of Yephet, this was only in&nbsp;order to underline an important act performed by the one&nbsp;concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,25. פלג, כי בימיו נפלגה הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “Peleg,” so called as during his lifetime the population of the earth was split up.&nbsp;According to Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">37,7, states that former generations who had been endowed&nbsp;with holy spirit were able to name their children in a manner&nbsp;that reflected important acts that they would perform in the&nbsp;future, whereas we who have not been enabled to “make use&nbsp;of holy spirit” and who did not know i.e. we did not witness&nbsp;the deeds which made our forefathers famous, (as the&nbsp;lifespan had been so drastically curtailed) must name our&nbsp;children after our ancestors in order to keep alive at least&nbsp;some knowledge of their importance during their lifetime.&nbsp;[This is how this editor understands the commentary by&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">maharzu</span><span class="font5"> on this passage of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נפלגה הארץ, </span><span class="font5">literally: “the earth was divided;” a reference to people’s life-spans having been halved. Careful analysis of&nbsp;the text will show that up until the birth of Peleg, people&nbsp;appear to have lived for 400 years, whereas starting with him&nbsp;they did not live to be much more than 200 year old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,32. אלה משפחות בני נח</span><span class="font5">, “these are the families of Noach’s sons;” in this paragraph we find 70 descendants; 14&nbsp;descendants of Yephet; 30 of Cham, and 26 of Shem. These&nbsp;are the founding fathers of the famous “70 nations” of the&nbsp;earth. All the nations that stem from them bear the names of&nbsp;these founding fathers. For instance: We read already in&nbsp;Genesis 4,17 when the first city was built by Kayin for his&nbsp;son, that he named the city after his son. Compare Psalms:&nbsp;49,12 בשמותם עלי אדמות, “after the names of those who had&nbsp;been famous on earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,11. לאבן</span><span class="font5">, “as stone.” The letter ל is vocalised with a semi vowel, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va,</span><span class="font5"> not with a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">והחמר היה להם לחומר</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“and the bitumen served them as mortar.” They mixed it with pitch in order to make it&nbsp;waterproof. The pitch here is called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chemor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,4. וראשו בשמים</span><span class="font5">, “with its top in the sky.” This is obviously an exaggeration, a figure of speech. The Torah&nbsp;uses such exaggerations when describing Canaanite cities&nbsp;as “fortified into the sky,” (Deuteronomy 1,28) We must not&nbsp;forget that the term: שמים, sometimes refers to spiritual&nbsp;concepts, as in “celestial spheres, whereas on other&nbsp;occasions it refers to the horizon, or outer space. Birds are&nbsp;sometimes described as flying, בשמים, obviously not “in the&nbsp;heavens,” but “in the air.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונעשה לנו שם</span><span class="font5">, “and let us make a name for ourselves.” They referred to establishing a reputation of grandeur </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> any other creatures. [I do not understand with which other&nbsp;creatures they wanted to compete, as man was the supreme&nbsp;creature on earth. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פן נפוץ</span><span class="font5">, “lest we scatter.” They were afraid that war might break out among them, assuming there were competing&nbsp;nations or human beings in distant areas unknown to them.&nbsp;At any rate, they realised that strength lay in numbers and in&nbsp;visibility over vast distances, such as the top of a tower that&nbsp;can be seen from afar. Basically, they felt that if they were to&nbsp;obey G’d’s command “to fill the earth,” this would contribute&nbsp;to their becoming ineffective in competition with G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,6. וזה התלם לעשות, “and this is what they have&nbsp;begun to do.” </span><span class="font5">The letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ה </span><span class="font5">in the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hachilom</span><span class="font5"> has the&nbsp;vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach</span><span class="font5"> under it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועתה לא יבצר</span><span class="font5">, “and now that they all </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">know</span><span class="font5"> seventy tongues, unless they will be scattered they cannot be&nbsp;prevented from translating their evil design into action.” [By&nbsp;dispersing them, they will forget the other tongues, and this&nbsp;will make unity harder for them to maintain. [This&nbsp;interpretation is first found in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor,</span><span class="font5"> one of the&nbsp;Tossaphists, Rabbi Yoseph. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,7. ונבלה</span><span class="font5">, “let us confuse, etc.” the word is closely related to בלולה, “thoroughly mixed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר לא ישמעו איש את שפת רעהו</span><span class="font5">, so that they will not understand one another’s language.” They will forget any&nbsp;tongue other than the one they are in the habit of using. The&nbsp;seventy tongues will remain their collective property, but not&nbsp;everyone will be able to speak all these tongues. No </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">new&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">tongues came into existence at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,10. אלה תולדות שם</span><span class="font5">, “These are the descendants of Shem;” whenever a paragraph commences with the word:&nbsp;אלה, this is to alert us that it is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font5"> a continuation of what had&nbsp;preceded it. In this instance, the Torah wishes to distinguish&nbsp;between the evil people featured in the previous paragraph&nbsp;and the good people, whose descendants followed their&nbsp;illustrious ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,11. ויחי שם אחרי הולידו את ארפכשד</span><span class="font5">, “After having sired Arpachshad, Shem lived for another 500 years.” The formula&nbsp;preceding the death of the members of the earlier&nbsp;generations familiar to us as: ויהיו כל ימיו, “all of the years of&nbsp;his life were, etc.,” is absent now seeing that the life-spans of&nbsp;the antediluvian generations had closely approached 1000&nbsp;years, something no longer the case after the deluge.&nbsp;(Compare Psalms 90,5 זרמתם שנה, “You let their years flow&nbsp;past as if they had only slept.” According to David, normal life&nbsp;spans in his time amounted to 70, maximum 80 years; verse&nbsp;10 in the same chapter) There was therefore no need for the&nbsp;Torah to add the words: “all their days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויולד בנים ובנות</span><span class="font5">, “he sired sons and daughters.” The earth filled up with human beings after the deluge, According to an&nbsp;opinion quoted in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> as well as in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">69, it was not unusual for eight year olds to be able to&nbsp;ejaculate semen which produced fetuses. When people who&nbsp;had left behind adult children died, their death is often&nbsp;described as שכיבה, “lying down,” whereas when they did not&nbsp;leave behind adult children they are described as “having&nbsp;died,” i.e. וימת. An example of the former is King David,&nbsp;(Kings I 2,10), whereas an example of the latter is his uncle&nbsp;Yoav, or, according to a different manuscript, Job, who did&nbsp;not leave behind adult sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יסכה</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash,i</span><span class="font5"> this is another name for&nbsp;Sarah. If So, Haran must have sired her when he was only 6&nbsp;years old, according to the list of the names of Terach’s&nbsp;children. Avraham was supposed to have been a year older&nbsp;than Nachor, whereas Nachor was a year older than Haran,&nbsp;which means that Avraham was two years older than Haran.&nbsp;When we allow a year until Milkah and her sister Yiskah each&nbsp;were born, and we know that Avraham was 10 years older&nbsp;than Sarah from the Torah’s own report, it follows that Haran&nbsp;could not have been older than 8 years when Sarah was&nbsp;born. Allowing for the pregnancies preceding the birth of&nbsp;Milkah and Yiskah, Haran could not have been older than 6&nbsp;years when he slept with his wife. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit Rabbah 38,14)&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Other examples of products of such early unions are Betzalel&nbsp;and Bat Sheva, as well as Er and Onan, sons of Yehudah,&nbsp;son of Yaakov. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 69)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עקרה, אין לה ולד</span><span class="font5">, whereas originally she had not&nbsp;even had a womb, by the time she became pregnant with&nbsp;Yitzchok she had grown a womb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקח תרח את אברם בנו</span><span class="font5">, Terach took his son Avram,&nbsp;etc;” he intended to take him all the way to the land of&nbsp;Canaan, seeing that he was descended from Shem and that&nbsp;land had been given by G’d to the descendants of Shem as&nbsp;we know from Genesis 9,27. Lot and Sarai went with Terach,&nbsp;seeing they were the survivors of Haran’s family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצאו אתם מאור כשדים</span><span class="font5">, “they emigrated with them from Ur of the Chaldeans at the command of G’d.” The basis for this&nbsp;interpretation is found in Genesis 15,7, where G’d is quoted&nbsp;as telling Avraham: “I am the Lord Who has taken you out of&nbsp;Ur Casdim;” (not Terach). According to this interpretation, we&nbsp;do not know precisely where G’d had told Avram to leave Ur&nbsp;Casdim. The author of this interpretation is Ibn Ezra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבאו עד הרן</span><span class="font5">, “they came as far as Charan.” Terach was not able to complete the journey all the way to the land of&nbsp;Canaan, and died in Charan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Lech Lecha</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.1. ויאמר ה' אל אברם לך לך</span><span class="font5">, The Lord said to Avram: “go&nbsp;for yourself, etc;” While Terach and Avram were still in Ur&nbsp;Casdim, G’d told Avram to leave his homeland. He did not&nbsp;specify his ultimate destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the words: מארצך, “from your homeland.” “Leave the land in which you are currently&nbsp;residing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וממולזץ</span><span class="font5">, “G’d added this to prevent Avram from returning to his birthplace, Ur Casdim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומבית אביך, </span><span class="font5">“and from the house of your father.” G’d did not want Avram to ever return to his father’s house in order&nbsp;to receive his share of the inheritance. He promised to&nbsp;reward him far beyond anything he could expect as his share&nbsp;of his father’s estate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here adds a peculiar comment, writing that here the meaning of בית אביך is that where Avram had resided thus&nbsp;far he would not be able to become a father of children.&nbsp;Apparently, he bases himself on our sages in the Jerusalem&nbsp;Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Taanit:</span><span class="font5"> 2,1: that there are three things which are apt&nbsp;to cancel a decree against someone siring children: changing&nbsp;the place of one’s residence, changing one’s name, and&nbsp;observing a fast, praying for children. (Compare also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit&nbsp;Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 44,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “to the land;” the definitive article ה, is to remind Avraham that seeing he was descended from Shem,&nbsp;he had a legal claim to this land. This conforms to how </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">(Verse </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">6)</span><span class="font5"> explains why he was instructed to walk throughout&nbsp;this land (Genesis 13,17) in order to claim it through having&nbsp;set foot in it. G’d Himself guided him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואעשך לגוי גדול</span><span class="font5">, “I am going to make you into a&nbsp;great nation, etc.” G’d, being aware that Avram’s wife is&nbsp;presently barren, tells him that notwithstanding this fact he&nbsp;will become the founding father of a great nation. We had&nbsp;been told in Genesis 11,30, of Sarah’s inability to have&nbsp;children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of this verse: The Torah does not write: ואשימך לגוי גדול</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“I will make </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">you</span><span class="font5"> to be a great nation,&nbsp;which could have been misinterpreted.” G’d stressed that He&nbsp;would perform an act that would neutralise any negative&nbsp;decree from which Avram suffered, i.e. changing both his&nbsp;and his wife’s name. People called: Avraham, and: Sarah,&nbsp;had never been decreed to remain childless. According to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> originally Avram lacked 5 important organs:&nbsp;eyes, ears, as well as the glans. The glans is called “the&nbsp;head of the body,” as sacrificing, i.e. circumcising it is&nbsp;equivalent to offering one’s entire body as an offering to G’d.&nbsp;(Compare Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nedarim</span><span class="font5"> 32.) When G’d added the letter&nbsp;ה to his name, He supplied these missing 5 organs of his&nbsp;body. This is meant when G’d invited him to become תמים,&nbsp;“whole, a perfect specimen. (Genesis 17,1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואגדלה שמך</span><span class="font5">, “I will make your name great.” This was accomplished by adding a single letter to his name. Through&nbsp;this addition the numerical value of the letters in his name&nbsp;amounted to 248, the total number of limbs in a perfectly&nbsp;formed human (male) specimen. [Incidentally, this is also the&nbsp;total number of positive commandments in the Torah. Ed.]&nbsp;Avraham then had a perfect body and a perfect, whole name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה ברכה</span><span class="font5">, “as a result you will become a source of blessing.” We find a parallel to this expression in Isaiah&nbsp;19,24: ביום ההוא אשים את ישראל ברכה בקרב הארץ, “on that day I&nbsp;will set up Israel as a blessing in the midst of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,3. ואברכה מברכיך</span><span class="font5">, “I will bless those who bless you.” You must never think that there are no people on earth that&nbsp;are psychologically close to you and are potential saviours of&nbsp;you, for I love those who love you and I hate the people who&nbsp;hate you. [in other words I know that there are people who&nbsp;love you. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואברכה מברכיך ומקללך אאור</span><span class="font5">, “I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you;” you may question why&nbsp;elsewhere G’d uses the reverse order, i.e. “he who curses&nbsp;you, and I will bless him who blesses you” (Genesis 27,29).&nbsp;The reason for that formulation is that as a general rule, the&nbsp;righteous first experience trials and tribulations in their lives,&nbsp;whereas their relative serenity does not occur until they are&nbsp;well advanced in age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[When Yaakov was well advanced in years and thought the time had come for him to “retire,” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> in&nbsp;his commentary on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 84,3, he attributes his&nbsp;problem with Joseph to Yaakov expecting worry free life in&nbsp;this world also. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer to the above question is that we must distinguish between </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">who</span><span class="font5"> does the blessing and cursing.&nbsp;When the subject is a human being, a righteous person who&nbsp;bestows a blessing, he will commence by mentioning the&nbsp;negative first and the positive as the conclusion (as did&nbsp;Yitzchok when he blessed Yaakov, thinking that Esau was&nbsp;righteous, as in Genesis 27,29) When the subject is G’d&nbsp;Himself, as when G’d blessed Avraham, here, it is more&nbsp;appropriate that He should commence by mentioning the&nbsp;positive aspects first. Furthermore, as generally speaking&nbsp;there are likely to be more people who bless a man such as&nbsp;Avraham, seeing that they are the majority, they are&nbsp;mentioned first, whereas the Torah speaks of מקללך, “he who&nbsp;curses you,” in the singular mode, not “they who curse you,”&nbsp;in the plural mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ונברכו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">a weak conjugation, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam,</span><span class="font5"> in the sense of refining through mixing. Through intermarriage&nbsp;with your descendants many nations will become spiritually&nbsp;uplifted. This is also why the Torah refers here to: משפחות&nbsp;האדמה, “the families on earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וילך אתו לוט</span><span class="font5">, “Lot (his nephew) went with him.”&nbsp;Seeing that the death of Lot’s father Haran was indirectly due&nbsp;to Avraham who had been saved from Nimrod’s furnace a&nbsp;deed Haran emulated, -but only after having seen Avraham&nbsp;being saved- Avraham did not feel he could reject him at this&nbsp;stage. He adopted him as if he had been his own son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואברם בן חמש ושבעים שנה</span><span class="font5">, “and Avram was 75 years old;” the Torah told us how old Avram was at the time in order to&nbsp;show that he followed G’d’s instructions and abandoned the&nbsp;house of his father, an aged man still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">בצאתו מחרן, “when he left Charan.” The Torah repeats this, as already pointed out in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Seder Olam,</span><span class="font5"> an ancient&nbsp;historical text deemed reliable by the sages. According to&nbsp;that text, Avram had first returned to Charan and five years&nbsp;later departed from there once more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.5. ואת לוט בן אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “and Lot, the son of his brother.” Lot was a brother of Sarai, as we had been told in Genesis&nbsp;11,31. The Torah had also stated that Haran was the father&nbsp;of Milkah and Yiskah in verse 29 there. Our sages in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">14 state that “Yiskah” is identical with “Sarah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת הנפש עשו בחרן </span><span class="font5">“and the proselyte (to monotheism) they had made in Charan.” Our sages </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Avodah Zarah</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">9, claim&nbsp;that this is the first stage of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Matan Torah,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">the giving&nbsp;(revealing) of the Torah. The manner in which Targum&nbsp;Onkelos renders this phrase is further evidence of this. [He&nbsp;speaks of Avraham communicating, i.e. converting to Torah.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,6.עד מקום שכם, </span><span class="font5">as far as the location of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">(in Moses’ time). During Avraham’s time the city of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">did&nbsp;not exist yet</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד אלון מורה</span><span class="font5">, “as far as the terebinth at Moreh;” according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">this is a reference to the mountains of&nbsp;Gerizim and Eyvol, which G’d showed Avraham on this&nbsp;occasion as a location where the Israelites would confirm&nbsp;their loyalty to the Torah. The Torah refers to this location&nbsp;again in Deuteronomy 11,30. According to our author, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elon&nbsp;Moreh</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elon mamre</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">are the same location.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In Numbers 13,22 as well as in Deuteronomy 11,10 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">states that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cham</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">had built the city of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chevron</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">for his&nbsp;son Canaan. According to this it would appear that the land&nbsp;of Canaan (Holy Land) had been given by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Noach</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">to his son&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cham</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font5"> We must therefore understand what </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">wrote here&nbsp;as referring not to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shem</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">personally, but as to one of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shem’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">descendants. Perhaps he referred only to part, the northern&nbsp;section of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eretz Yisrael.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">His section included Jerusalem. The&nbsp;major section of the land of Canaan spread southwards in&nbsp;the direction of Egypt. Chevron was already part of the&nbsp;southern section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, if we look at the wording in the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ketuvot</span><span class="font5"> 112, where the Talmud challenges the underlying&nbsp;assumption that Cham built a city for his younger son&nbsp;Canaan before he built a city for his older son Mitzrayim, this&nbsp;sounds peculiar. According to the Torah in Numbers 13,22&nbsp;Chevron was built seven years before Tzoan of Egypt.&nbsp;Clearly then the Torah had not spoken of Cham having built&nbsp;these cities, but of Noach. We may assume that the&nbsp;interpretation of the passage we quoted from the Talmud is&nbsp;to be understood as a question, i.e. “surely this is&nbsp;unbelievable?” [This is the way it appears in our versions of&nbsp;the Talmud. Ed.] Noach built Chevron for his younger son&nbsp;Shem, and subsequently he built Tzoan for his son who was&nbsp;2 years older than Shem. The Torah, according to the&nbsp;Talmud, wished to state that the city of Chevron was seven&nbsp;times more successful than the city Tzoan. [The word שנים,&nbsp;usually meaning “years,” may also be used instead of פעמים,&nbsp;“repeated times.” Ed.] If we accept this interpretation, the line&nbsp;that the Canaanites were at that time trying to wrest the land&nbsp;of Shem from him, i.e. to conquer Chevron and Jerusalem,&nbsp;makes much better sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והכנעני אז בארץ</span><span class="font5">, the word: אז, “then,” (in the past) indicates that the Torah did not speak about the political situation at&nbsp;the time when the Jewish people were in possession, but&nbsp;about the political situation at the time when Avraham first&nbsp;wandered through that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,8. ויעתק משם</span><span class="font5">, “he moved on from there;” we find the same expression having a similar meaning in Job 9,5, i.e.&nbsp;המעתיק הרים, “He Who moves mountains.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מקדם לבית א-ל</span><span class="font5">, “from the eastern side of Bet El, westward.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,11. כאשר הקריב</span><span class="font5">, “as he brought his camp closer.” We find a sample of a similar construction, [instead of כאשר קרב&nbsp;“as he approached,” as we would have expected. Ed.] in&nbsp;Exodus 14,10: ופרעה הקריב, “and Pharaoh brought his army&nbsp;closer to the camp of the Israelites.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הנה נא ידעתי</span><span class="font5">, see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary on this formulation, and similar examples of it in Genesis 19,2,&nbsp;where Lot greets the angels. [Our author refers to the part of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary in which Avraham states that Sarai’s physical beauty has for the first time become something&nbsp;critically important. [Similarly, he compares it to Lot, who at&nbsp;this juncture realised for the first time how critically important&nbsp;an offer of hospitality to these angels may become. Ed.] He&nbsp;also understands the word נא in this context not as a plea,&nbsp;but as a reference to time being of the essence in making a&nbsp;decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אשה יפת מראה את</span><span class="font5">, “for you are an extraordinarily beautiful woman.” This comment is an introduction to the&nbsp;verse following in which Avram suggests how to neutralise&nbsp;the danger to him that Sarai’s beauty now poses.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.12. והיה כי יראו אותך המצרים והרגו אותי ואותך יחיו</span><span class="font5">, “as</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">soon as they will see me (your husband), they will kill me and let you live;” The Egyptian laws respected the inviolability of&nbsp;a man’s wife. If they wanted to get hold of his wife, their only&nbsp;legal way was to kill the husband on some charge. [One of&nbsp;the perverted concepts of Egyptian morality was that&nbsp;sleeping with another man’s wife is a sin which they are&nbsp;guilty of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">each</span><span class="font5"> time they do so, whereas killing her former&nbsp;husband is a sin that they would commit only a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">single</span><span class="font5"> time.&nbsp;Source: one of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tossaphists.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: Avram feared that he would be killed before he had a chance to appeal to the Egyptian king&nbsp;for justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אמרי נא אחותי את</span><span class="font5">, “please say that you are my&nbsp;sister.” Avraham reasoned that if the Egyptians were to ask&nbsp;him if Sarai was a married woman, he would respond by&nbsp;claiming that her husband had abandoned her. The&nbsp;Egyptians would therefore have no reason to kill him on&nbsp;account of her absent husband, and they would leave her&nbsp;alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי כבוא אברם מצרימה, </span><span class="font5">As soon as Avram came to&nbsp;Egypt, etc.;” according to the plain meaning of the text, it&nbsp;sounds as if all the people in the entourage are considered&nbsp;as merely as an appendage to Avram, his fate dominating&nbsp;what would happen to all the people who had traveled to&nbsp;Egypt with him. Further confirmation of this approach to the&nbsp;text is what we read in verse 10 where Avram is described as&nbsp;descending to Egypt in the singular, i.e. וירד אברם מצרימה,&nbsp;which sounds as if he alone had traveled to Egypt, although&nbsp;we know that Lot was with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולאבדם היטיב בעבורה</span><span class="font5">, “and he had done Avram&nbsp;favours on her account.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> quotes the verse without&nbsp;offering any commentary on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וינגע ה' את פרעה</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hashem</span><span class="font5"> afflicted Pharaoh with a&nbsp;painful plague;” the reason why the Torah offers no further&nbsp;details about the nature of this plague, as opposed to when&nbsp;Avimelech was struck with impotence and the women in his&nbsp;country were afflicted in their birth canals, is because shortly&nbsp;after the episode with Avimelech the Torah reported that&nbsp;Sarah conceived and became pregnant (Genesis 21,1). Had&nbsp;the Torah not spelled out that Avimelech had become totally&nbsp;impotent, people might have attributed Sarah’s pregnancy to&nbsp;her having stayed in Avimelech’s Palace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The episode with Pharaoh had occurred perhaps a s long as 20 years earlier, so that no one could have fabricated&nbsp;such a story. To the question why Pharaoh was punished,&nbsp;seeing that Avram had deceived him by saying that she was&nbsp;his sister, as we know from the Torah quoting him, Sarai had&nbsp;described herself as Avram’s wife even if he had not said so.&nbsp;This is the meaning of the words: על דבר שרי אשת ברם “on&nbsp;account of what Sarai, Avram’s wife had said.” Pharaoh had&nbsp;ignored her. Gentiles do not have to be warned not to violate&nbsp;the commandments they have accepted to observe, as we&nbsp;pointed out in connection with Genesis 20,5. (The second&nbsp;Avimelech and Rivkah)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וינגע ה׳ את פרעה</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hashem</span><span class="font5"> afflicted Pharaoh.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> He afflicted him with a kind of gonorrhea, thus&nbsp;making the punishment fit the crime. The same occurred with&nbsp;Sarai and Avimelech. G’d interfered with all the women in the&nbsp;land of the Philistines being unable to give birth to fetuses&nbsp;that were ready to be born. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> end of chapter&nbsp;52.) According to a dissenting view, Pharaoh had become&nbsp;afflicted with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> a skin eczema resulting in the afflicted&nbsp;persons being ostracized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,19. למה אמרת אחותי היא</span><span class="font5">, “why did you say: “she is my sister,” whereas she never said that you are her brother. This&nbsp;is distinctly different from when Sarah had been kidnapped&nbsp;by Avimelech, and the latter had subsequently accused her&nbsp;in his dream of having said that Avraham was her brother.&nbsp;(Genesis 20,5) [It was part of his plea that he was totally&nbsp;innocent. Ed. Our author ascribes Sarah’s conduct </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Pharaoh as due to her relative youth and naivety, whereas&nbsp;by the time she was kidnapped by Avimelech she had&nbsp;become more familiar with the real world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,1. ולוט עמו הנגבה</span><span class="font5">, “and Lot with him, southward.” In the same direction as they had been journeying ever since they&nbsp;had left Charan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא נשא אותם</span><span class="font5">, “the land did not offer sufficient virgin&nbsp;land to support their combined flocks and herds.” The Bible&nbsp;using the term ארץ, as if it were masculine here, is not a&nbsp;unique example. It also occurs in the masculine mode in&nbsp;Zachariah 14,10, as well as in Isaiah 9,18, and in Isaiah 33,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי היה רכושם רב</span><span class="font5">, “for their possessions were so vast.” The point the Torah is making is that, contrary to what could be&nbsp;expected, poverty leads to strife about sharing the little one&nbsp;owns, in this instance excessive wealth led to strife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.7. בין רועי מקנה אברם ובין רועי מקנה לוט</span><span class="font5">, “between Avram’s shepherds and Lot’s shepherds.” Neither of them&nbsp;could locate additional grazing land which was not privately&nbsp;owned. The reason was that the Canaanites had claimed all&nbsp;that land as theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי כלה משקה, </span><span class="font5">“for all of it was well irrigated.” Some&nbsp;commentators understand the verse: וירא את כל ככר הירדן, to&nbsp;mean that the river Jordan irrigated the entire region&nbsp;bountifully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'כגן ה</span><span class="font5">, “as if it were a garden planted by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> Himself, not unlike Egypt which was also irrigated by the river Nile.&nbsp;(Compare Genesis 2,10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויפרדו איש מעל אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “they separated totally from&nbsp;one another.” This separation lasted historically throughout&nbsp;the generations so that descendants (male) of Lot were&nbsp;never allowed to convert to Judaism. (Deuteronomy 23,4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.12. ויאהל עד סדום, “</span><span class="font5">he erected his tents as far as Sodom.” He did not take up residence inside the city of&nbsp;Sodom, because he knew that those people were evil and&nbsp;wicked. This is also why later on the Torah described Lot as&nbsp;sitting in the gateway to Sodom. (19,1) His house, though&nbsp;part of the wall of Sodom, had its entrance outside that wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואנשי סדום רעים</span><span class="font5">, “the people of Sodom behaved&nbsp;wickedly toward fellow human beings.” This is spelled out in&nbsp;greater detail in Ezekiel, 17,49,) ויד עני ואביון לא החזיקה; “It did&nbsp;not support the poor or the destitute.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וה' אמר אחרי הפרד לוט מעמו</span><span class="font5">, “and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> had said&nbsp;after Lot had separated from him, etc.” G’d had told Avram&nbsp;that he made a mistake when he thought that Lot having&nbsp;moved to Sodom, or the valley near it was enough, as that&nbsp;was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">also</span><span class="font5"> part of the territories that He had in mind to give to&nbsp;Avram’s descendants as their ancestral territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחרי הפרט לוט מעמו</span><span class="font5">, “the need for this separation was to forestall Lot from ever claiming that his descendants were&nbsp;entitled to part of the land of Israel.” The relevant words&nbsp;concerning this interpretation are: כי את </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">כל הארץ</span><span class="font5"> אשר אתה רואה,&nbsp;“for the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">whole</span><span class="font5"> land that you can see;” [Lot had also decided&nbsp;on the basis of what he </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">could see.</span><span class="font5"> (13,10) Ed.] G’d&nbsp;emphasised that Lot should never have any claim to any part&nbsp;of the Holy Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.17. קום התהלך בארץ, </span><span class="font5">“arise and walk throughout the land;” in order to establish claim to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאהל אברם ויבא וישב</span><span class="font5">, “Avram pitched his tent and&nbsp;arrived and settled;” actually, we would have expected the&nbsp;Torah to write the following sequence: ויבא אברם ויאהל וישב</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5">Avram arrived, pitched his tent, and settled;” we learn from&nbsp;the inverted sequence that the meaning of the word: ויאהל,&nbsp;here cannot be the usual meaning, i.e. “he pitched his tent;”&nbsp;here it means that “he folded his tent.” There are many words&nbsp;in the holy Tongue that have two different meanings&nbsp;depending the context in which they appear. The second&nbsp;meaning may be the opposite of the usual one. The best&nbsp;known example of this is the word דשן, which in Leviticus 6,3&nbsp;means ash, residue, whereas in Exodus 27,3 is used as&nbsp;something being collected in special containers instead of&nbsp;something to be scattered removed. At any rate, Avram&nbsp;moved his tent from no-man’s land in the land of Canaan to&nbsp;inhabited regions, i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elon moreh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.2</span><span class="font5">. מלך צביים, although the word: צביים is spelled as shown, it is read as if it had been spelled: .צבוים</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומלך בלע היא, </span><span class="font5">the pronoun </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">היא </span><span class="font5">(feminine), shows that the word בלע refers to the name of the city, not the name of the&nbsp;king, (who is masculine).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span><span class="font5">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הוא ים המלך, the word ים, “sea,” is masculine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,6. בהררם</span><span class="font5">, the ending is similar to Exodus 6,7 בדברם, so that the meaning of our phrase is: “when they were&nbsp;ascending Mount Seir.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד איל פארן אשר על המדבר</span><span class="font5">, the word על in this verse does not mean: “on, or above,” but: “beside,” as it does in Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">40,3, and in Genesis 24,30. The desert in question is the one&nbsp;the Israelites marched through for most of 40years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כדרלעמר</span><span class="font5">, he is mentioned first at this point as he&nbsp;was the cause of the entire war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועמק השדים בארות</span><span class="font5">, according to an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aggadic&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">commentary quoted by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash,i</span><span class="font5"> the miracle that the king of&nbsp;Sodom escaped from this valley filled with bitumen wells&nbsp;which burns people, convinced the people now that Avram&nbsp;had indeed escaped from Nimrod’s furnace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to a different interpretation, the word שדים is to be read with the dot on the left side of the letter ש, so that the&nbsp;meaning would be the same as the word שיד in Deuteronomy&nbsp;27,2 the whitewash with which the stones taken out of the&nbsp;Jordan river were to be smeared as a base for writing on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בארות בארות חמר, </span><span class="font5">“pits full of sticky loam.” The letter ב has a vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol</span><span class="font5"> under it and the letter א the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chatoph&nbsp;segol,</span><span class="font5"> (shortened version.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויפלו שמה</span><span class="font5">, They fell into them. They did not “fall” into them, as they were familiar with them, but they used them to&nbsp;hide in while trying to escape the pursuers. The construction&nbsp;is similar to Genesis 25,18 where Yishmael is described as&nbsp;על פני כל אחיו נפל. The loam was not wet, but could be used to&nbsp;help make bricks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והוא יושב בסדום</span><span class="font5">, “and he dwelled in Sodom;” note&nbsp;the singular mode; none of his relatives lived in Sodom. This&nbsp;accounted for his being taken captive alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternate explanation: he had taken up residence there so as not to be considered a rival of the Sodomites. Or he&nbsp;entered the city now that he was afraid of being solitary&nbsp;against the warring nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבא הפליט, </span><span class="font5">“the one who had escaped</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kedorleomer’s army arrived;” according to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">commentary this was the man who later on became Og, King of Bashan who had made a name for himself by having&nbsp;survived the deluge, hence the prefix ה before the word: פליט,&nbsp;escapee. He lived so long that eventually Moses killed him&nbsp;(Numbers 21,35)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He was not interested in saving Avram, but intended to marry Sarah after Avram would have been killed in war.&nbsp;G’d retaliated by paying him back in kind. He granted him&nbsp;long life for warning Avram on the one hand, but He foiled his&nbsp;design, Avram becoming victorious, and Sarah predeceasing&nbsp;Avram. He was chagrined to live long enough to see millions&nbsp;of Avram’s descendants, before himself being killed by one&nbsp;of them. [None of these </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">midrashim</span><span class="font5"> account for the Torah’s&nbsp;failure to report his having survived the deluge. Ed.] Granted,&nbsp;if this was a fact, Moses had reason to fear him and that is&nbsp;why G’d told him not to be afraid of him. (Numbers 21,34).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zevachim,</span><span class="font5"> 113, raises the question of how Og managed to escape the deluge and suggests that&nbsp;though the waters were boiling hot, in the immediate vicinity&nbsp;of the ark they were cool- miraculously so,-so as not to&nbsp;destroy the ark and its inhabitants. Og took advantage of this&nbsp;and survived. [This means that he went without food and&nbsp;water for 365 days. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression: הפליט occurs also in Ezekiel 33,21, where it refers to someone who had escaped and survived&nbsp;the battle of Jerusalem who reported the fall of the city and&nbsp;the Temple to the prophet. The verse which omits identifying&nbsp;who this escapee was is not so unusual that we need to look&nbsp;for far fetched explanations. Our author cites similar&nbsp;“abbreviated” constructions in Genesis 48,1; Genesis 48,2;&nbsp;he claims that there are numerous others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא שוכן באלוני ממרא</span><span class="font5">, “and he lived at the time in Elon Mamre.” The tree so called stood in the town of Chevron, as&nbsp;we know from Genesis 13,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the words: “and he lived in Elon Mamre which is in Chevron,” refer to the home of the person&nbsp;described as הפליט, “the escapee.” This would explain why he&nbsp;came to tell Avram whose home was also in Elon Mamre all&nbsp;about what he had escaped from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והם בעלי ברית אברם</span><span class="font5">, “and they (Oner, Eshkol, and Mamre) being allies of Avram went with him [in this mission&nbsp;impossible, 318 against four armies! Ed.] Compare verse 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירק את חניכיו</span><span class="font5">, “the men who had been trained in&nbsp;warfare.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד דן, </span><span class="font5">as far as Dan, the place was named such (the original “Dan” not having been born yet until at least 100&nbsp;years later, Ed.] The place called “Dan” in the Book of&nbsp;Judges was called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Leshem</span><span class="font5"> at the time of this battle&nbsp;(Compare Joshua 19,47).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויכם וירדפם</span><span class="font5">, “He defeated (killed) them and&nbsp;pursued them;” Rabbi Tanchum poses the rhetorical question&nbsp;how someone can pursue corpses? [Since the Torah first&nbsp;reports that these people had been smitten. Ed.] He answers&nbsp;that Avram killed the men whom G’d had pursued. G’d put&nbsp;the men to flight so that Avram could easily kill them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר משמאל לדמשק</span><span class="font5">, “which is located to the left of Damascus,” where Eliezer and his family hailed from.&nbsp;Onkelos translates the word דמשק as Eliezer; he meant that&nbsp;Eliezer’s family in that town assisted him and Avram in that&nbsp;task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,17. ויצא מלך סדום</span><span class="font5">, the King of Sodom now emerged from the pits in which he had hidden. He is mentioned by&nbsp;name, as the whole war had revolved around him, he having&nbsp;been the one who had refused to pay taxes to Kedorleomer.&nbsp;(Genesis 14,1-5) He had been the ring-leader of the five&nbsp;rebellious kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הוציא לחם ויין</span><span class="font5">, “he produced (from his satchel)&nbsp;bread and wine;” the rules of syntax would have demanded&nbsp;that the verses 17-18 should have been written in the&nbsp;following sequence: “The king of Sodom came out of hiding&nbsp;to meet Avram after he had defeated the 4 most powerful&nbsp;kings, and he said to Avram: “hand me over the human&nbsp;beings and keep the chattels for yourself.” (verse 22).&nbsp;Instead, the Torah interrupted with the arrival of Malki&nbsp;Tzedek and his blessing Avram. The reason that the Torah&nbsp;interrupted with verses 18-21 was that it wanted to put&nbsp;Avraham’s refusing any offer from the King of Sodom into&nbsp;proper context. If the Torah had inserted the words of Avram,&nbsp;saying that he would not even accept a shoelace so that the&nbsp;King of Sodom could not say that he had personally&nbsp;contributed to Avram’s material wealth, the world would have&nbsp;wondered how Avram could have paid the wages of his&nbsp;soldiers. After reading that Avram had first given ten per cent&nbsp;of all the loot to Malki Tzedek who represented the only G’d,&nbsp;they would not ask such questions. They had also learned&nbsp;that Avram did not mind accepting bread and wine from Malki&nbsp;Tzedek who had acquired all which he possessed by morally&nbsp;acceptable means. They realised that Avram shied away not&nbsp;from material possessions as such, but only from material&nbsp;possessions not acquired by morally and ethically acceptable&nbsp;means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: Malki Tzedek produced bread and wine which had not been tithed in order to give Avram an&nbsp;opportunity to perform that commandment, as we will explain&nbsp;on verse 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ברוך אברם</span><span class="font5">, “blessed be Avram;” he blessed Avram&nbsp;before blessing the Lord because Avram had gone to such&nbsp;length to imperil his life in order to rescue his nephew, Lot.&nbsp;Subsequently he blessed the Lord, Who had assisted Avram&nbsp;in his rescue mission and delivered his enemies into his&nbsp;hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קונה שמים וארץ</span><span class="font5">, “(the Lord) Who owns heaven as well a earth.” Malki Tzedek (Shem,-son of Noach-) used this&nbsp;formulation as he had witnessed in his own lifetime how a&nbsp;world which had been a going concern had been destroyed&nbsp;and rebuilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,20. ייתן לו</span><span class="font5">, “he gave him;” Malki Tzedek gave Avram a tithe of everything. Our sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nedarim</span><span class="font5"> 32, interpret this&nbsp;verse as an allusion by the Torah to Malki Tzedek having&nbsp;forfeited his status of being G’d’s priest, and it being&nbsp;transferred to Avram, as he had committed the error of&nbsp;blessing a mortal human being, Avram, before blessing the&nbsp;immortal Lord. Avram himself had criticised Malki Tzedek for&nbsp;having mentioned him first in blessing both G’d and him. The&nbsp;latter accepted the reproof and treated Avram as the priest&nbsp;by tithing to him all that belonged to him. The Talmud cites a&nbsp;verse from Psalms: 110,4, as its source; there we read: נשבע&nbsp;ה' ולא ינחם אתה כהן לעולם על דברתי מלכי צדק, “The Lord has&nbsp;sworn and will not relent, You are a priest forever a rightful&nbsp;king by My decree.” [Rabbi Moshe Alshich explains there that&nbsp;G’d actually killed all the people Avram fought, as a priest&nbsp;who has killed does no longer qualify for priestly duties. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הרימותי ידי</span><span class="font5">, “I have raised my hand (in a solemn&nbsp;oath)” Avram states in reply to the King of Sodom’s offer [of&nbsp;what was not even his to offer Ed.] that he has already set&nbsp;aside his share for the Lord, as is stated when the Torah&nbsp;wrote: “he gave him a tithe from all of it.” He meant that&nbsp;beyond this he did not mean to keep anything. (as per </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם מחוט</span><span class="font5">, “if as much as a thread;” the “thread”&nbsp;mentioned here is a thread used as jewelry on one’s head,&nbsp;as stated by our sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> 65, the “threads worn by&nbsp;the young girls on their heads were made of silk, and are&nbsp;used to tie their hair with them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שרוך נעל</span><span class="font5">, similar threads or laces to act as decoration when closing one’s shoes. Avram meant, I will not accept&nbsp;expensive or even inexpensive items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואם אקח מכל אשר לך</span><span class="font5">, “neither will I keep anything which (once) belonged to you.” Avram,- in order not to offend,-explained to the King of Sodom that when he left his father’s&nbsp;home G’d had assured him that He would make him wealthy.&nbsp;It is therefore no more than good manners for me to decline&nbsp;anything which would appear as if G’d’s promise had not&nbsp;been sufficient for me. When he would become wealthy, he&nbsp;wished to give the credit for this to G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,24. בלעדי</span><span class="font5">, the letter י in this word is unnecessary, just&nbsp;as the letter י in the word: זולתי in Deuteronomy 1,36 is&nbsp;unnecessary. The verse means that Avram will take only as&nbsp;much of the loot as belongs to the troops whom he had hired&nbsp;to fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אחר הדברי</span><span class="font5">ם האלה, after these events,” i.e. after&nbsp;Avram had successfully waged war against the armies under&nbsp;the leadership of Kedorleomer. He had suddenly become&nbsp;very worried that other nations would feel called upon to&nbsp;avenge this defeat of the pagans; we encounter a similar&nbsp;reaction by Yaakov, after his sons Shimon and Levi had&nbsp;killed the males of the city of Sh’chem, and his other sons&nbsp;had looted that town. (Genesis 34,30).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d had reassured him telling him that not only would He protect him against any other attacks by kings for having&nbsp;saved Lot, but that he would also qualify for additional&nbsp;rewards. You are entitled to this because you demonstrated&nbsp;that you placed more faith in My promises than in those of&nbsp;the King of Sodom, plus in the fact that you went to such&nbsp;length to rescue your relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.2. 'ויאמר אבר</span><span class="font5">ם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, אלוקי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וגו, </span><span class="font5">“Avram then said: “G’d,!” [the name of G’d here is spelled as א-ד-נ-י, ] etc; “what are&nbsp;You going to give me, seeing that I am without biological&nbsp;heir;” [i.e. what good will these rewards do me if I cannot&nbsp;pass them on to biological heirs? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reader is reminded that Avram had been promised biological heirs by this G’d in Genesis 12,7 when He had told&nbsp;him that He would give the land of the Canaanites to his&nbsp;biological descendants. At that time he had not questioned&nbsp;this promise because he had believed that with the help of&nbsp;prayer he would earn the merit of siring biological heirs.&nbsp;When he realised that in spite of this, many years had&nbsp;passed without this promise having been fulfilled, he had&nbsp;begun to feel that perhaps he had committed some sin that&nbsp;had prevented G’d from fulfilling this promise. This is why he&nbsp;pointed out that he was still without such heirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא דמשק אליעזר</span><span class="font5">, “the heir apparent at this stage is only the servant Eliezer who was born in Damascus</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.” </span><span class="font5">He was a&nbsp;grandson of the great pagan Nimrod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנה בן ביתי יורש אותי</span><span class="font5">, “and here a member of my household is going to be my heir.” Avram points to the&nbsp;apparent contradiction to G’d having assured him that he&nbsp;would sire biological heirs. He implies that seeing that he is&nbsp;already aging, even if and when he would have son, the son&nbsp;would be too young to take over from him when he would&nbsp;die, so that he would have to leave his affairs in the hands of&nbsp;his servant. This servant would possess power of attorney for&nbsp;all practical purposes to do what he liked. G’d reassured him&nbsp;on that score saying that not only would he have a biological&nbsp;heir, but that son would be fully of age before Avram would&nbsp;die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,5. ויוצא אותו</span><span class="font5">, it appeared to Avram in his dream as if G’d were now taking him out of his house to look at the sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחשבה, </span><span class="font5">the letter ח in this word is vocalised by the semi vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va na,</span><span class="font5"> which has a dot above it. (not in our editions)&nbsp;[This indicates that the subject of this word is Avram, not G’d.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויחשבה לו צדקה</span><span class="font5">, “Avram did not consider this&nbsp;promise by G’d as something that he was entitled to, but as&nbsp;something beyond what he had a right to expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ויאמר אליו אני ה</span><span class="font5">, :He said to him: “I am the Lord;”&nbsp;everything from the opening line of the chapter, “it was after&nbsp;these events” had been said to Avram at night, in a dream.&nbsp;This is clear from the word: במחזה, “in a vision,” (verse 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In verse five Avram is told: “and count the stars;” from that point on we have the paragraph known popularly as ברית&nbsp;בין הבתרים, “the covenant between the cut up pieces.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From then on we have a revelation Avram experienced in daylight, as the paragraph concludes with the words: “it&nbsp;was when the sun was about to set;” (verse 12) This&nbsp;revelation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by daylight had preceded the passage</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">commencing with chapter 15,1 by five years. This is clear from when G’d told Avram that “your descendants will be&nbsp;strangers and slaves for 400 years in a land that is not their&nbsp;own.” In Exodus12,41 the Torah reports that the Israelites&nbsp;had dwelled in Egypt for 430 years, i.e. that the prophecy&nbsp;made to Avraham had now been fulfilled. According to this,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Avraham did not have any child by Sarah (i.e. Yitzchok) until 30 years </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> this first revelation. The Torah had stated&nbsp;specifically that Avraham was 100 years old when his son&nbsp;Yitzchok was born (Genesis 20,5). In other words, Avram&nbsp;was 70 years old when he left Charan for the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">first</span><span class="font5"> time and&nbsp;when G’d first told him about the future including his&nbsp;descendants until they would be freed from slavery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When G’d addressed Avram for the second time and told him to sever his relationship with home and hearth and&nbsp;birthplace in Genesis 12,1, he was 75 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the well known historic record known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seder olam,</span><span class="font5"> Avram was 48 years old at the time of the Tower&nbsp;and the dispersal of mankind. This was followed by the 13&nbsp;years that the region known as the land of Canaan served&nbsp;and subsequently rebelled against Kedorleomer, a rebellion&nbsp;which lasted 13 years. (Not the 13<sup>th</sup> year as usually&nbsp;assumed). According to this calculation 26 years had&nbsp;elapsed at that time from when the Tower had been&nbsp;destroyed. If you add these years to the 48 years Avram had&nbsp;lived before that traumatic event was 74 or 75 years old. This&nbsp;is referred to when the Torah stated that Avram was 75 years&nbsp;old when he left Charan permanently. Immediately after&nbsp;Avram had defeated the kings mentioned in chapter 14, G’d&nbsp;appeared to him and ordered him to leave Charan and to&nbsp;proceed towards the Land of Canaan, his father’s original&nbsp;destination when he had left Ur Casdim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why the two paragraphs here were inserted in the Torah as if they had occurred almost simultaneously&nbsp;was so that the promise that Avraham would have biological&nbsp;offspring would appear in direct connection with the promise&nbsp;that Avraham’s descendants would inherit the land of&nbsp;Canaan as their ancestral heritage when the time would be&nbsp;ripe for that. The Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot</span><span class="font5"> 7, states specifically&nbsp;that these two visions referred to distinctly different subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The newsworthy development in Avram’s personality in the intervening between G’d having spoken to him five years&nbsp;earlier at the covenant between the “pieces,”is that for the&nbsp;first time a human being addressed the Almighty with the title&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">adonav.</span><span class="font5"> My Master (Verse </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">8).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to think that all that is written here in this chapter is part of a single revelation, and a single subject, up&nbsp;to verse 1 in chapter 16, why did the Talmud not consider&nbsp;verse 2 in chapter 15 in which Avram addressed him by the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> title, as the first time in history that this had ever&nbsp;occurred? Clearly what Avram said in verse 8 had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">preceded&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">what is quoted as having said in verse 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, if these paragraphs had been written in chronological order, how could Avram have dared ask G’d for&nbsp;a sign that His promise would come true without his being&nbsp;accused as having been lacking in faith? G’d, after all, had&nbsp;already clearly stated that his heir would be his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">biological</span><span class="font5"> heir&nbsp;(verse 4). It is therefore clear beyond doubt that in this&nbsp;chapter we are dealing with two different revelations, each&nbsp;one dealing with a different subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having said all this, it is easy to understand that G’d referred to the fact that it was He Who had taken him out of&nbsp;Ur Casdim in order to give to his descendants (equated with&nbsp;him) this land that he is to proceed to. Avraham’s question&nbsp;that seeing that he had no heir as yet, surely he by himself&nbsp;could not “inherit” this land, (verse 7) was quite logical. After&nbsp;all he had no assurance that he would not die before G’d’s&nbsp;promise having a chance at being fulfilled. It also explains&nbsp;why G’d, in verse 15, tells him not to worry, but that he would&nbsp;die at a ripe old age. [The only person ever having been&nbsp;given such a promise by G’d, I believe. Ed.] This promise by&nbsp;G’d is evidence of what had prompted his question, certainly&nbsp;was not lack of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some people accept </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> interpretation that Avram, while certainly not doubting G’d’s promise or ability to deliver&nbsp;on His promise, was concerned that seeing that all of G’d’s&nbsp;promises are based on certain underlying conditions, and he&nbsp;was afraid that some of these might not be met so that G’d&nbsp;would not be bound by His promise. We have evidence of&nbsp;fulfillment of G’d’s promises being delayed after the sin of the&nbsp;spies, when G’d swore an oath that all the adults involved in&nbsp;that sin would not set foot in the Holy Land. (Numbers 32,1011)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the exegetes claiming that Avram did not doubt G’d’s promise, but wished to know by what merit it&nbsp;would be fulfilled, why would he have been punished for&nbsp;having asked such a question? We would have to answer&nbsp;that the words: ידוע תדע, understood by some as the&nbsp;punishment, i.e. the delay in the fulfillment of G’d’s promise,&nbsp;was not a punishment at all, but a direct answer, meaning&nbsp;that until the time came when in the desert the Israelites&nbsp;would regularly offer up sacrifices, they would indeed not yet&nbsp;have earned that merit. This merit coupled with the suffering&nbsp;during exile in Egypt combined, would suffice to make G’d&nbsp;replace the Canaanites and give the land to the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;קחה לי עגלה</span><span class="font5">, “please take for Me a female calf;” the&nbsp;purpose of this revelation was to inform Avram what type of&nbsp;animal sacrifice would be appropriate to atone for which kind&nbsp;of unintentionally committed sins, so that the descendants of&nbsp;Avram would continue to exist. This interpretation is based&nbsp;on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah 44,</span><span class="font5">14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עגלה משולשת</span><span class="font5">, “a healthy and fat calf.” Compare Jeremiah 48,34 where the expression עגלה שלישיה occurs in the same&nbsp;sense. Compare also Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin</span><span class="font5"> 56, עגלא תלתא. An&nbsp;alternate explanation for the word משולשת is: “three years&nbsp;old.” (Compare Ibn Ezra and Nachmanides)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקח לו את כל אלה</span><span class="font5">, “He took all these animals for&nbsp;Him;” our sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> claim that G’d showed&nbsp;Avram even what the measurement of a tenth of an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eyfah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">looked like, (part of meal offerings). This is based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit&nbsp;Rabbah 34,14</span><span class="font5"> where similar expressions are quoted as&nbsp;occurring here and in Leviticus 2,8: והבאת...מאלה where that&nbsp;meal offering is discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבתר אותם</span><span class="font5">, Avram cut these animals in half. Some exegetes feel that all animal sacrifices were to be cut up in a&nbsp;similar manner. (no source mentioned) This opinion is based&nbsp;on the Torah writing in Leviticus 1,6: ונתח אותה לנתחיה, “the&nbsp;priest is to cut it up according to its components.” [The&nbsp;animal being offered as a burnt offering. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת הצפור לא בתר</span><span class="font5">, “but he did not cut up the bird.” Later on, after the Torah was given, bird offerings were also not cut&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">up</span><span class="font5"> but the priest tore parts apart with his bare hands.&nbsp;(Levitcus 1,17.) [The Torah there adds that the tearing must&nbsp;not result in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">complete</span><span class="font5"> separation of one part from another.&nbsp;Ed.] Our author feels that the reason is that they would then&nbsp;seem as too small to be fit as gifts to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation: The words ויבתר אותם בתוך, mean that he had cut them in half, i.e. in the middle. He had&nbsp;to allocate half of each animal to each party of the covenant,&nbsp;seeing that there were three of each of the mammals. He did&nbsp;not have to cut up the birds as there were only two, so that a&nbsp;whole bird could be allocated (symbolically) to each of the&nbsp;two parties of the covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישב אותם אברם</span><span class="font5">, Avram chased the vultures away.&nbsp;This verse has been inserted in the Torah only in order to&nbsp;draw our attention to the great sensitivity of Avram. After all,&nbsp;the vultures were only doing what vultures were supposed to&nbsp;do. Avram chased them away temporarily, until the presence&nbsp;of the Lord had taken leave of him, and the covenant had&nbsp;been concluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי השמש לבא</span><span class="font5">, “when the sun was about to set;”&nbsp;in other words, it was still full daylight, not yet time to lie&nbsp;down and sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ידוע תדע, </span><span class="font5">G’d used the same words when&nbsp;punishing Avram that Avram had used when asking a&nbsp;question which was sinful. His descendants were ordained to&nbsp;endure exile as an example of matching the punishment to&nbsp;the crime. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma Kedoshim,</span><span class="font5"> 13) [only&nbsp;according to the exegetes who interpreted Avram’s question&nbsp;as demonstrating doubt in G’d’s promise. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועבדום</span><span class="font5">, “they will serve the rulers of that and other lands.” The subject is Avram’s descendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וענו אותם, </span><span class="font5">They (the nations), will oppress them during that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את הגוי</span><span class="font5">, the subject is the exile in Egypt. The&nbsp;word: וגם, “and also,” is a hint of other exiles in the history of&nbsp;the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואחרי כן יצאו ברכוש גדול</span><span class="font5">, “as a reward for having endured all this they will leave for freedom with many possessions as&nbsp;compensation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,16. ודור רביעי</span><span class="font5">, “and the fourth generation;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">makes the following calculation concerning this ambiguous&nbsp;statement: the generations mentioned commence with&nbsp;Yehudah, son of Yaakov, (Avraham’s great-grandson),&nbsp;Peretz, Chetzron, Calev, son of Chetzron already entered&nbsp;and lived in the holy Land. If someone were to raise the point&nbsp;that already Chetzron had taken part in the Exodus from&nbsp;Egypt, i.e. he had been liberated from exile, Yaakov cannot&nbsp;be included as the fist generation, as he had already lived for&nbsp;130 of his 147 years before taking up residence in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different way of making the calculation meant in the above prophecy: “the fourth generation” of which G’d spoke&nbsp;does not refer to the fourth generation of Israelites, but to the&nbsp;fourth generation of the Emorites, [whose sin, as G’d had&nbsp;explained, had not yet reached the point that gave G’d&nbsp;justification to expel them from their homeland, Ed.] The&nbsp;length of a generation of Emorites is considered as being&nbsp;100 years. Therefore it would take 400 years until G’d’s&nbsp;promise to Avraham could be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah, however, did not add the word דור, except for the fact that G’d, when meting out judgment, one does not&nbsp;do so in terms of multiples of hundreds of years, but in terms&nbsp;of generations. [We have examples of this in Exodus 20,5 as&nbsp;well as in Exodus 34,7. Ed.] We also find examples of this in&nbsp;Kings II 10,30. G’d had promised Yehu that even the son of&nbsp;the fourth generation would sit on the throne of the Kingdom&nbsp;of Israel. [The last one, Zecharyah, only ruled for 6 months.&nbsp;Ed.] [The “Kingdom of Israel,” is distinct from the kingdom of&nbsp;Yehudah. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי לא שלם ערן האמורי</span><span class="font5">, “for the cup of sin of the Emorite is not full;” if you were to ask why I cannot give the land of the&nbsp;Canaanites to the Israelites as soon as they have become a&nbsp;nation, the answer is that I am bound by judicial&nbsp;considerations of My own, namely to allow each nation an&nbsp;opportunity to become penitents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ערן האמורי, </span><span class="font5">“the guilt of the Emorite;” the reason why this tribe is mentioned repeatedly as compared to other similarly&nbsp;sinful nations, is simply because Avraham lived on soil&nbsp;owned by the Emorites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,17. והנה תנור עשן ולפיד אש</span><span class="font5">, “and suddenly Avram experienced as vision of a furnace and a fire, stroke of&nbsp;lightning;” the construction of this verse is somewhat&nbsp;lopsided, as the correct syntax should have been: ואש לפיד</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5">and fire in the form of a bolt of lightning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר עבר</span><span class="font5">, “after G’d had informed Avram about the experiences of Avram’s descendants during the next 400&nbsp;years or so,” G’d’s ”agents,” the fire and furnace, consumed&nbsp;the parts of the sacrifices that Avram had prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.19.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את הקיני, ואת הקניזי, ואת הקדמוני</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“the Kenite, the&nbsp;Kenizite, and the Kadmoni; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> these tribes&nbsp;are identical to the Edomites, the Moabites and the&nbsp;Ammonites. The territories of these nations would become&nbsp;part of “greater Israel” at some time in the future, not in the&nbsp;time of Joshua. A scriptural reference to this can be found in&nbsp;Isaiah 11,14. According to our author, this is also hinted at in&nbsp;Numbers 24,21. The reason why the territory of Edom is&nbsp;included is because Amalek, Israel’s (G’d’s) arch enemy, is&nbsp;descended from Edom (Esau). Bileam in the passage&nbsp;referred to in Numbers 24, has called Amalek: “the first of the&nbsp;nations.” Since this was certainly not the original human&nbsp;society to develop into nationhood, and Bileam had been&nbsp;aware of this, Rabbi Chelbo in the name of Rabbi Yochanan,&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 44,23, claimed that originally G’d had&nbsp;already meant to let Israel inherit the territories of ten&nbsp;nations. However, He would not translate the intention of&nbsp;handing them the territories of these last mentioned three&nbsp;nations into reality until the messianic era. Nonetheless, due&nbsp;to aggressive conduct by their inhabitants, they lost some&nbsp;portion of it already during the period when Moses&nbsp;conquered the territories of Sichon and Og.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת הרפאים</span><span class="font5">, another word for the tribe known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chivvi,</span><span class="font5"> mentioned as one of the seven Canaanite tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,1. ושרי אשת שברם לא ילדה</span><span class="font5">, “meanwhile, Sarai, Avram’s wife had failed to give birth; this verse is intended to inform&nbsp;us that the covenant just concluded between G’d and Avram&nbsp;preceded the time when Avram was blessed with biological&nbsp;offspring. We should not assume that here too the principle&nbsp;that the Torah need not report events in their chronological&nbsp;sequence could be applied. As a reminder of this, the Torah&nbsp;reports that up until now Sarai had not conceived or given&nbsp;birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמה הגר</span><span class="font5">, “whose name was Hagar;” when Pharaoh handed over his daughter to Sarai (when the latter was a&nbsp;captive in his Palace) he had said to her: “my daughter is&nbsp;your compensation for my having wronged you. ”Here is your&nbsp;reward.” (Based on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Matnot kehunah</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Br’eshit Rabbah)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">As&nbsp;a result she was renamed: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hagar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,5. חמסי</span><span class="font5">, “look at what reward I get that my own maidservant refuses to obey my commands, and acts&nbsp;rebelliously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עליך</span><span class="font5">, “this is all on your account;” if you had protested her disrespecting me it would not have happened. I do not&nbsp;feel like punishing her as she has becoming </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> concubine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ישפוט ה' ביני וביניך</span><span class="font5">, “may the Lord judge which one of us is right.” I am concerned with your dignity, whereas you have&nbsp;not respected my dignity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וביניך</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">claims there is an extra “dot” on this word. What he means is that everywhere else the word ביניך is&nbsp;spelled with only one letter י, whereas here it is also spelled&nbsp;with a י before the last letter. It therefore ought to be read as&nbsp;ובניך. The Talmud reports that words which have dots placed&nbsp;there by Ezra who after the return of the exiled Jews had to&nbsp;decide from differing Torah scrolls which had the correct&nbsp;spelling, used these dots to remind readers that some doubt&nbsp;had existed concerning this spelling. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Avot</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">de Rabbi Nathan,&nbsp;chapter 34.) If he had found such dots in some scrolls he did&nbsp;not want to take the responsibility for removing them,&nbsp;(according to a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tossaphot</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah 15.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At any rate, we have a rule that if someone calls upon G’d to determine if concerning an accusation leveled against&nbsp;a fellow human being he or she had been correct, the first&nbsp;thing the heavenly tribunal does is to examine if the accuser&nbsp;has led a blameless life himself or herself. If faults are found&nbsp;in the accuser’s life, he is judged, i.e. punished first, before&nbsp;the accusation is examined in greater detail. In the event,&nbsp;Avraham had to bury Sarah, i.e. on the one hand she died&nbsp;earlier than he, though younger than he, and on the other&nbsp;hand he lost her. According to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">the substance of&nbsp;Sarai’s complaint was that if Avram had prayed not only to&nbsp;have children </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">himself</span><span class="font5"> but had included her in his prayer, the&nbsp;whole subject of offering Hagar to him as a concubine would&nbsp;never have arisen. Her accusation is considered as “an evil&nbsp;eye” (Compare Mizrachi, super commentary on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">concerning the fetus in Hagar’s womb.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;במדבר, על העין בדרך שור</span><span class="font5">, “in the desert, by a well, on&nbsp;the way to Shur.” This location is one that the Israelites&nbsp;traversed as mentioned in Exodus 15,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הגר שפחת שרי</span><span class="font5">, “Hagar, Sarai’s servant maid!” The&nbsp;angel reminds her that her status as Sarai’s servant maid&nbsp;had not changed. She acknowledged this when she replied&nbsp;that she was fleeing from her </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mistress</span><span class="font5"> Sarai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,12. פרא אדם</span><span class="font5">, an anonymous trader who travels to distant places where he is not known; compare Genesis&nbsp;37,25 where the Torah describes such a caravan of&nbsp;Ishmael’s descendants to whom Joseph was sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word פרא also occurs as the definition of a person in Job 11,12. ועיר פרא יולד, i.e. an infant born and not yet&nbsp;named is a פרא. A person who lacks the intelligence and&nbsp;senses of ordinary people is called there: עיר פרא, “a wild&nbsp;ass;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[I am not sure about the difference between פרא אדם and אדם פרא. What seems clear is that the adjective פרא&nbsp;appears to diminish the degree of צלם אלוקים, Divine image&nbsp;that ordinary people have been equipped with from birth. It&nbsp;may be noteworthy that both Kayin and Hevel when born, the&nbsp;first human beings to have been born by woman, were not&nbsp;described as possessing this Divine image as opposed to&nbsp;Sheth, Chavah’s third son.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,1.התהלך לפני</span><span class="font5">, an invitation to perform the rite of circumcision, as a result of which his body would become&nbsp;more “perfect.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">[The underlying reason for this may be that by depriving him of his full name, the caller implies that he was still&nbsp;partially a gentile. This is loosely translated by me for the&nbsp;words לפי שנתלוה עמו גיות, used by the author. Ed.]&nbsp;Nechemyah 9,7 where reference to this name change is&nbsp;made, is no contradiction to what is stated in the Talmud, as&nbsp;it also records what has been written here. The Talmud&nbsp;refers to the difference from Yaakov who was given the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">additional</span><span class="font5"> name Israel, without the name Yaakov having&nbsp;been erased. Seeing that he had been a descendant of&nbsp;Avraham and Yitzchok, the name Yaakov </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span><span class="font5"> had a&nbsp;connotation of something connected to paganism which had&nbsp;to be erased. Already Yitzchok’s name never required to be&nbsp;changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה שמך אברהם</span><span class="font5">, “henceforth your name will always be: Avraham.” It is an ancient custom to change someone’s&nbsp;name as a sign that he had received a promotion. We find&nbsp;this with Sarah, Yaakov, Joshua, as well as with Chananyah,&nbsp;Mishael, and Azaryah. (Daniel 1,7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,11. ונמלתם</span><span class="font5">, “you shall circumcise yourselves;” all those who had not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">been</span><span class="font5"> circumcised on the eighth day after&nbsp;birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה לאות ברית</span><span class="font5">, “it will be the enduring symbol of the covenant.” The act of circumcision will transform gentiles to&nbsp;become my servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,13. המול ימול, </span><span class="font5">“the first word refers to the removal of&nbsp;the foreskin, the second to the removal of the thin membrane&nbsp;covering the head of the penis below it, known as פריעה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>

Rabbi Yoshua ben&nbsp;Korach, commenting on the name changes of both Avraham&nbsp;and Sarah, points out that there was no change in the total&nbsp;numerical value of the letters in their </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">combined</span><span class="font5"> names,&nbsp;seeing that G’d had reduced the value of the letter 10=י, by&nbsp;substituting the letter 5=ה, in Sarah’s name, but had added&nbsp;the letter 5=ה to Avraham’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,17. ויאמר בלבו</span><span class="font5">, “He said to himself:” the expression ויאמר בלבו, as in Genesis 27,41 about Esau, or in Esther 6,6&nbsp;where it is used about Haman, is typical for wicked people;&nbsp;on the other hand, when a similar expression is used in&nbsp;connection with righteous people the formulation is: ויאמר על&nbsp;לבו, as in Samuel I 27,1 in connection with David, or in Daniel&nbsp;1,8 in connection with Daniel. The reason for this change in&nbsp;formulation is that the righteous are allowed to carry out their&nbsp;plans, i.e. what is in their hearts, as they are in charge of&nbsp;their hearts, whereas the wicked only think that they will be&nbsp;able to carry out their plans. The reason that in connection&nbsp;with Avraham the former formulation is used, is because the&nbsp;reader of these words is apt to think that even Avraham&nbsp;doubted G’d’s promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והקימותי את בריתי אתו</span><span class="font5">, “I will maintain My covenant&nbsp;(the promise contained therein) with him.” G’d means that&nbsp;Yitzchok will be the first person to be circumcised on the&nbsp;eighth day of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולישמעאל שמעתיך, </span><span class="font5">“and concerning Yishmael, I&nbsp;have heard your request, etc.” I am going to bless him, but I&nbsp;will not include him in My covenant with you which I will&nbsp;maintain with Yitzchok, the covenant that I concluded with&nbsp;you between the “pieces” as detailed in chapter 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,21. 'וישמעאל בנו בן שלש עשרה שנה וגו </span><span class="font5">, “and Ishmael his&nbsp;son who was 13 years old at the time, etc;” the details&nbsp;provided in this verse are meant to teach us that Avraham as&nbsp;well as his son were circumcised on the same day. We&nbsp;derive this from the expression: בעצם היום הזה, as elsewhere&nbsp;the Torah had told us that Avraham had been ninety nine&nbsp;and the Torah records that Avraham was eighty six years old&nbsp;on the day when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael, and that he&nbsp;was ninety nine years old when he circumcised himself. The&nbsp;only possible reason why the Torah had to be so precise&nbsp;about both data was to teach us that just as Avraham had&nbsp;not delayed with carrying out G’d’s commandment, so also&nbsp;Ishmael submitted to the same commandment without delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את בשר ערלתו, </span><span class="font5">the flesh of his foreskin; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5">, Ishmael, although still a child, had to proceed and&nbsp;perform the circumcision on himself. He adds that this was&nbsp;more painful for him than for his father, whose member had&nbsp;become softened through frequent use in sleeping with his&nbsp;wife. The additional word את, used by the Torah when&nbsp;describing Ishmael’s circumcision, is supposed to draw our&nbsp;attention to this distinction. According to the Talmud in&nbsp;Yevamot 72, even though the additional commandment for&nbsp;Jews to also remove the membrane mentioned earlier had&nbsp;not yet been given, Avraham understood that it would be&nbsp;given in the future, and he performed the circumcision&nbsp;precisely as we do nowadays. According to our sages in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma 28,</span><span class="font5"> Avraham even performed the rites known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eyruv&nbsp;tavshilim,</span><span class="font5"> preparing some food for the Sabbath </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">following</span><span class="font5"> a&nbsp;festival when the festival occurred on the Friday, so that&nbsp;cooking on the festival would not look as if one had used the&nbsp;festival as merely a day to prepare for the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,26. בעצם היום הזה</span><span class="font5">, -on the very same day-when G’d had issued the command;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נמול אברהם</span><span class="font5">, the day which later on would correspond in our calendar to the Day of Atonement was the day when&nbsp;Avraham performed the circumcision on himself. (Compare&nbsp;Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer chapter 29). If Avraham had divined</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the laws of the Torah through use of his intelligence, why had he not performed such an important commandment much&nbsp;earlier? It may have been in order not to discourage potential&nbsp;proselytes in the future. If people contemplating conversion&nbsp;to Judaism would have thought that the very first step in such&nbsp;a conversion was to be the painful rite of circumcision, they&nbsp;might have developed second thoughts. As to the question of&nbsp;why G’d had delayed the commandment until after He had&nbsp;concluded the covenant between the pieces with him, the&nbsp;reason was so that when he would sire Yitzchok, this son&nbsp;would have been the son of a fully fledged Jew already&nbsp;before developing in Sarah’s womb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,27. וכל אנשי ביתו</span><span class="font5">, “and all the males of his household;” where the previous verse had spoken only of&nbsp;Avraham, this one speaks of all the members of his&nbsp;household. This included slaves purchased by him, not born&nbsp;to members of his household, as well as anyone belonging to&nbsp;Yishmael.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נמולו אתו</span><span class="font5">, it does not say: מלו אתו, which would have implied that they were circumcised against their will, but they&nbsp;were all willing participants in this procedure.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Vayera</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,1. וירא אליו, </span><span class="font5">“He appeared to him;” Rabbi Chama son of Rabbi Chanina, claims that this appearance occurred on&nbsp;the third day after Avraham had circumcised himself.&nbsp;(Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Babba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> 86, and quoted by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.)</span><span class="font5"> G’d&nbsp;“visited” him as one visits a sick person. The interpretation by&nbsp;that Rabbi is plausible as we do not find anywhere else that&nbsp;the word: וירא is used without the purpose or message of that&nbsp;appearance being spelled out by the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other commentators believe that G’d’s appearance to Avraham was necessary in connection with revealing to him&nbsp;what He intended to do to the inhabitants of Sodom and the&nbsp;cities associated with it. The angels’ appearance to Avraham&nbsp;interrupted what G’d had planned to tell him at that point,&nbsp;seeing that one of them at least was charged with saving Lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third interpretation: The substance of the word וירא was the visit paid to Avraham by the three angels. It is not&nbsp;unusual for angels to be referred to as “G’d, Divine beings;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the author cites some examples of this being: Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">23,21, where G’d explains to Moses that His name his&nbsp;integral to the angel He plans to send ahead of the marching&nbsp;Israelites, and that this is a reason the people must be&nbsp;especially cautious not to offend him. The angel has the&nbsp;authority to react </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> first obtaining specific permission&nbsp;from G’d to do so. At the burning bush we find another such&nbsp;occasion where G’d and the angels are referred to&nbsp;interchangeably; we also find it at the binding of Yitzchok,&nbsp;when “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">G’d</span><span class="font5">” is portrayed as commanding Avraham to offer his&nbsp;beloved son as an offering, whereas an “angel” orders him&nbsp;not to harm his son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באלוני ממרא</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> that location was named after Mamre, who had been the only one of Avraham’s three&nbsp;allies who had advised him to go through with the command&nbsp;to circumcise himself. As a reward, Avraham experienced a&nbsp;revelation in the property belonging to Mamre. Mamre’s&nbsp;argument had been that seeing that G’d had saved Avraham&nbsp;miraculously from Nimrod’s furnace, surely He had only&nbsp;Avraham’s best interests at heart all the time. Proof lay in the&nbsp;fact that He had even enabled Avraham with only 318&nbsp;soldiers to defeat four mighty armies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators are of the opinion that all the three allies of Avraham also circumcised themselves. There is&nbsp;even an opinion that those three died as a result of&nbsp;circumcising themselves. (Our author does not reveal his&nbsp;sources for these latter statements.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet another opinion holds that Mamre advised Avraham on how to heal the wound that he had inflicted upon himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא יושב פתח האהל</span><span class="font5">, “and Avraham was seated at the entrance to the tent.” Close to noon, close to the hour when&nbsp;m ost learned people consum ed their main meal of the day.&nbsp;He was looking in all directions if he would find someone to&nbsp;share his meal with. If so he would invite him indoors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כחו</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">היו</span><span class="font5">ם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“during the hottest part of the day.” This detail has been added in honour of Avraham who, at a time when&nbsp;the chance of potential guests being out in the sun was&nbsp;extremely slim, nonetheless positioned himself in that heat in&nbsp;such a way that he could not fail to notice anyone being out&nbsp;in the sun. This is why after begging the angels, (whom he&nbsp;thought to be weary travelers) he added that as soon as they&nbsp;had refreshed themselves he would not detain them any&nbsp;longer. After all, it was midday; when these angels came to&nbsp;Lot he offered them lodging for the night as it was too late to&nbsp;continue their journey on the same evening. (Compare 19,1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,2. והנה שלשה אנשי</span><span class="font5">ם, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> these “three men,” were in fact three angels with different tasks to&nbsp;perform. One was Rafael, whose task it was to heal Avraham&nbsp;from the wounds of the circumcision. (this is based on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Talmud Baba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> 86. He then went on to save Lot.) Of&nbsp;the two angels who proceeded on to Sodom, one was&nbsp;Michael. If it had been so this would contradict the statement&nbsp;of our sages that an angel is assigned only one task at a&nbsp;time. Some Rabbis consider saving Lot as similar in principle&nbsp;to healing Avraham, so that there would be no contradiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נצבי</span><span class="font5">ם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">interrupting their walk by assuming a position which invited enquiries by anyone seeing them. Our author&nbsp;quotes Exodus 34,2 ונצבת לי, as a similar use of this verse;&nbsp;i.e. Moses is invited by G’d to stop climbing the mountain and&nbsp;wait until He gives him the inscribed set of the second&nbsp;Tablets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וירץ לקראתם</span><span class="font5">, “he ran toward them, having understood that this was the reason why these men had suddenly halted&nbsp;for a purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר: א-דוני</span><span class="font5">, “the vowel under the letter ד is a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz,</span><span class="font5"> to indicate that the word is used by someone who&nbsp;was aware that he addressed a messenger from G’d, not just&nbsp;a plural ending; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Minchat</span><span class="font5"> Shay) [For practical purposes this&nbsp;means that the word must not be erased as it is one of the&nbsp;holy names of G’d. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל נא תעבור מעל עבדך</span><span class="font5">, “please do not continue without stopping by at your servant.” Avraham addressed the most&nbsp;important one of them. To the question how he knew which&nbsp;one was the most important one, the answer is that the other&nbsp;two appeared to walk alongside him on either side in the&nbsp;manner that students do when they accompany their Rabbi.&nbsp;We know this from the Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> 37. The text there&nbsp;reads as follows: when the three angels appeared to&nbsp;Avraham, Michael walked in the center and Gavriel and&nbsp;Rafael on either side of him. (Our sages supplied us with the&nbsp;order of the hierarchy of the angels. (Compare an interesting&nbsp;edition called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">malachey elyon,</span><span class="font5"> by Rabbi Reuven Margolit,&nbsp;published by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mossad Harav Kook.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds; “even though the Torah reports Avraham as running to meet them </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> he had already addressed&nbsp;them, the Torah did not report this in the chronological&nbsp;sequence. He had run to meet them </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before,</span><span class="font5"> as otherwise he&nbsp;would have had to shout at them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You might disagree by quoting the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> 6, according to which the principle of the Torah&nbsp;not being bound to report in chronological sequence only&nbsp;applies when two or more different occurrences are&nbsp;discussed, and here we are dealing with a single occurrence;&nbsp;but according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the system used by the Torah here,&nbsp;is the one known as מקרא מסורס, “a truncated verse.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ורחצו רגליכם, </span><span class="font5">“and wash your feet</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.” </span><span class="font5">This all&nbsp;occurred during the season of the desert winds, known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sharaf,</span><span class="font5"> as explained by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> G’d had&nbsp;made the day especially hot, so that the feet of travelers&nbsp;would be soaked in sand and sweat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,15. כי על כן עברתם על עבדכם</span><span class="font5">, “for surely that is the reason that you passed by your servant;” Avraham indicated&nbsp;that it was not the habit of travelers to skip the main meal&nbsp;which is normally consumed at noon. He indicated that he&nbsp;realised that they were modest and bashful, and had not&nbsp;asked for any food or drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כן תעשה כאשר דברת, </span><span class="font5">“yes, you may do as you have proposed to do.” They agreed to accept the absolute&nbsp;minimum as suggested by Avraham. Nonetheless, he did not&nbsp;deny himself the opportunity to prepare a sumptuous meal&nbsp;for these guests. It was the custom for guests of distinction to&nbsp;invite their host to share the meal with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the words: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כן תעשה</span><span class="font5">. The expression is a wish that the party addressed may continue&nbsp;to conduct himself in the manner just demonstrated; in other&nbsp;words: “may you have frequent opportunities to play host to&nbsp;guests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,6. מהרי </span><span class="font5">“hurry!” seeing that the men still had a distance to walk in order to reach Sodom before nightfall,&nbsp;they did not have much time to spend at Avraham’s tent. [Did&nbsp;Avraham know that Sodom was their next destination from&nbsp;the direction in which they were headed? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שלש סאים קמח</span><span class="font5">, “three measures of flour;” this was the amount of average quality flour from which it was possible to&nbsp;distil the amount of superior flour (1 tenth of the tree&nbsp;measures known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sa-ah)</span><span class="font5"> to bake cakes for three adults&nbsp;such as these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קמח</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Avraham instructed Sarah to use the kind of flour used for covering the pots, an&nbsp;expression known in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> 37 as “bread&nbsp;baked from ground flour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other commentators understand Avraham’s instruction to Sarah here to mean that she should bake the entire&nbsp;amount of flour, all three measures. He did so as this was the&nbsp;maximum capacity of the ovens they used. Our sages add&nbsp;that the quality of bread baked in a full oven is superior to&nbsp;that which was baked when the oven was half empty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לושי</span><span class="font5">, when the angels arrived at Lot, (Genesis 19,3) he is described as having </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">baked</span><span class="font5"> the unleavened bread. From&nbsp;this it is deduced that the women made the dough, kneaded&nbsp;it, whereas the man did the actual baking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ועשי עוגות, “and make it into cakes;” something that does not take long to bake. He was conscious that these “men”&nbsp;were in a hurry to get going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בן בקר רך, “a calf which is soft and can be cooked&nbsp;quickly.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here comments that the reason why he&nbsp;insisted on slaughtering </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">three</span><span class="font5"> calves, [surely more than they&nbsp;could consume even if they had not been in hurry, Ed.] was&nbsp;because he wanted to serve them only the best part of&nbsp;animal, i.e. the tongue (seasoned with mustard). (Based on&nbsp;Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eyruvin</span><span class="font5"> 28) In earlier eras tongue was not served&nbsp;with pepper, as pepper was not universally available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקח חמאה וחלב, (meanwhile) “he took butter and&nbsp;milk;” our Rabbis (in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 48,9) state that it is&nbsp;understood that Avraham also served them bread, seeing&nbsp;that he served them things he had not even promised.&nbsp;Although we have no proof for the fact, as one does not&nbsp;usually eat cheese when expecting to be served meat shortly&nbsp;thereafter, and not in the reverse order, the order in which&nbsp;the Torah lists the menu makes this a plausible assumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ובן הבקר, “and the calf;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the Torah should have written “and the calves;” (pl) some&nbsp;commentators justify the use of the singular by pointing out&nbsp;that Avraham started serving as soon as the first calf was&nbsp;ready to be served. The three lads whom Avraham had&nbsp;charged with these tasks did not all work at the same speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ויאכלו, “they ate;” according to the Talmud, which says the angels had been told by G’d to behave on earth as do the&nbsp;earthlings, we may understand this literally. According to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aggadah,</span><span class="font5"> they pretended to eat in order to make Avraham&nbsp;feel that he had fulfilled the virtue of being hospitable.&nbsp;Concerning the first interpretation, G’d is supposed to have&nbsp;criticised the angels that even babies are more discriminating&nbsp;than they, as babies who have been circumcised refrain from&nbsp;eating meat and make do with milk. (Based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessikta&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">rabbati</span><span class="font5"> at the end of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshah.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמרו אליו, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> when the dots&nbsp;above the three letters איו, as well as elsewhere in the Torah&nbsp;when the complete word is longer than the number of letters&nbsp;having dots, we are to look for an interpretation for the letters&nbsp;that have no such dot. If you were to ask why the letter ל in&nbsp;this word does not have a dot? This fact prompts us to&nbsp;assume that the angels had first asked Sarah where&nbsp;Avraham was before they asked him where Sarah was. This&nbsp;cannot be correct, as clearly they had not even seen Sarah&nbsp;until after they had eaten. Now that the word has only three&nbsp;dots, it is clear beyond argument that they had first seen&nbsp;Avraham. Subsequently, they asked Sarah where Avraham&nbsp;was. This would also conform to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 29,28 where he says that the dots teach us&nbsp;that this verse was not written in its proper place, i.e. that the&nbsp;law promulgated there did not become effective until after the&nbsp;Israelites had stood at Mount Gerizim and Mount Eyvol. [It&nbsp;appears that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> point here is that it is good manners for&nbsp;a guest to enquire after the wellbeing of both one’s host and&nbsp;one’s hostess. This sentence has been omitted in our&nbsp;author’s quotation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary on this verse.&nbsp;[Seeing that I do not have the author’s Italian original, I prefer&nbsp;to assume that the Hebrew translator omitted it. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">commentary is based on the first opinion offered in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit&nbsp;Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 48,15 Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שוב אשוב אליך, “I will definitely come back to you&nbsp;to visit);” the angel speaks about two separate occasions&nbsp;when he will return; one in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey,</span><span class="font5"> the other in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">[According to Rabbi Chavell’s annotation, these words need&nbsp;to be understood in conjunction with verse 12; the prediction&nbsp;of the angels was made in Nissan, and when by the time of&nbsp;the month of Tishrey, Sarah had not experienced signs of&nbsp;pregnancy she despaired. At that point G’d [when the angel&nbsp;returned the first time. Ed.] challenged her attitude asking&nbsp;Avraham why she made fun of the prediction. The prediction&nbsp;was repeated, confirmed, and by Nissan of the year Sarah&nbsp;had become a mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כעת חיה, [usually translated as “at this time next year,” Ed.]. The expression is so unusual that we must revert to&nbsp;the fact that angels live forever. Were it not for that fact, how&nbsp;did they know that it was in their power to return again,&nbsp;maybe they would have died in the interval? This must be&nbsp;contrasted with a similar statement by the prophet Elisha&nbsp;who was a mortal human being and who promised only “at&nbsp;this time next year,” without mentioning that he would return&nbsp;to witness this fact. (Compare Kings II 4,17 and mentioned&nbsp;by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> there.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כעת חיה</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> seeing that the letter in the word כעת, does not have the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sheva</span><span class="font5"> under it but the&nbsp;vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz,</span><span class="font5"> the prediction does not refer to “at the same&nbsp;season.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא אחריו</span><span class="font5">, according to the Jerusalem Targum this means that Ishmael was standing (unseen) behind the angel&nbsp;and overheard all this. He had done so not out of curiosity&nbsp;but to ensure that Sarah would not be alone with what he&nbsp;presumed was a male stranger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,11. ואברהם ושרה זקנים</span><span class="font5">, “and both Avraham and Sarah were old;” seeing that the Torah tells us in Genesis 24,1 that&nbsp;Avraham was old and advanced in years, what is the point of&nbsp;the Torah telling us here that Avraham was old? The answer&nbsp;must be that in the interval G’d had restored a degree of&nbsp;youthfulness to Avraham, so that in chapter 24 we are told&nbsp;that by then he had become “old” again. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit&nbsp;Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 48,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זקנים באים בימים</span><span class="font5">, “old advanced in years.” We do not find a single reference to old age in the Torah anywhere before&nbsp;this point. Avraham was the first human being described as&nbsp;having “aged.” The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> attributes the fact that the Torah&nbsp;here refers to Avraham’s age as due to his having said to&nbsp;G’d: “with all respect, G’d, when father and son walk together&nbsp;and come to a town where neither of them is known, how will&nbsp;they know to honour the father, seeing that they both appear&nbsp;as equally youthful? If You were to “crown” elderly people&nbsp;with a visible sign of their being old, they will know to whom&nbsp;to pay their respects first.” G’d answered Avraham that he&nbsp;had presented a valid argument and that therefore he would&nbsp;be the first human being upon whom this distinction would be&nbsp;bestowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Along similar lines, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> points out that before Yitzchok, no one was afflicted with physical handicaps, (such&nbsp;as Yitzchok’s blindness) Yitzchok was afflicted with such a&nbsp;handicap at his own request, having said to G’d: “if a human&nbsp;being dies without ever having endured physical handicaps&nbsp;and pain, the attribute of Justice will present a strong case&nbsp;against him by saying that he had never had to suffer any&nbsp;pain for any of the sins he had committed while alive. These&nbsp;pains would have been deemed as punishment so that upon&nbsp;death he could proceed to the regions of eternal bliss in the&nbsp;celestial regions without further delay. G’d agreed with him,&nbsp;and made him the first human being to be thus afflicted. We&nbsp;have not read about anyone falling sick before Yaakov&nbsp;requested that sickness become part of life on earth. Yaakov&nbsp;argued that unless sickness precedes death, a person would&nbsp;not have an opportunity to allocate his estate to his various&nbsp;beneficiaries. G’d agreed with him, and thus he became the&nbsp;first person of whom sickness preceding his death is reported&nbsp;in the Torah in Genesis 48,1. The two or tree days that his&nbsp;sickness lasted, gave him an opportunity to arrange his&nbsp;affairs. This is the reason why the Torah informed us that&nbsp;Joseph was given notice that his father was sick. Otherwise,&nbsp;seeing that he had 11 other sons around him in Goshen, why&nbsp;did special notice have to be sent to the capital where&nbsp;Joseph resided? To sum up: Avraham introduced the&nbsp;concept of old age; Yitzchok introduced the concept of&nbsp;people becoming afflicted with serious physical handicaps.&nbsp;Yaakov introduced the concept of sickness due to&nbsp;approaching death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חדל להיות לשרה אורח כנשים</span><span class="font5">, the Torah emphasises that although other elderly women had stopped menstruating,&nbsp;Sarah had continued to experience menses, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has&nbsp;explained on the line; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“he took butter and milk,”</span><span class="font5"> i.e. that he&nbsp;could not take bread as on that day Sarah had become&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">niddah,</span><span class="font5"> had menstruated, thus causing the dough she had&nbsp;handled to become ritually unclean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,12. ותצחק שרה</span><span class="font5">, “Sarah laughed;” when the month of Tishrey began, six months after the prediction of the angels,&nbsp;and she had not experienced signs of pregnancy, she&nbsp;abandoned all hope of that prophecy becoming true, as there&nbsp;were only six months left for it to become true. Contrary to&nbsp;her husband Avraham, she had lost faith in the prediction.&nbsp;The reason that Avraham maintained faith in the prediction&nbsp;was that he had heard it from G’d </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">directly</span><span class="font5">, (the angel had&nbsp;spoken to him in the name of the Lord), whereas Sarah, had&nbsp;only been an eavesdropper, and possibly she had not heard&nbsp;correctly. She had assumed that the angels speaking to&nbsp;Avraham had been ordinary human beings. She took a look&nbsp;at her belly and asked mockingly whether such a belly could&nbsp;possibly produce a fetus. As soon as she had done so, in&nbsp;Tishrey, G’d asked Avraham why Sarah had reacted in such&nbsp;a manner, adding that at the time appointed, i.e. when a year&nbsp;had passed at the time of Passover, in the following year, the&nbsp;angel would return and she would have become a mother. In&nbsp;practice this means that the first time she heard the&nbsp;prediction she had heard it from the mouth of an angel whom&nbsp;she had believed to be a mortal human being. The second&nbsp;time Avraham heard it from G’d </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">directly,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. 'ויאמר ה, “the&nbsp;Lord said;” this was followed by G’d adding: “Is anything&nbsp;impossible for the Lord to do?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Support for this interpretation can be found seeing that when the angels on the same evening met Lot, Lot offered&nbsp;them unleavened bread, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzot</span><span class="font5"> for supper, a hint that the&nbsp;date was the date that would later on become the night of the&nbsp;Seder of the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[This is not far fetched at all, as the night when Avraham had fought and secured Lot’s freedom, had been&nbsp;the corresponding date, and Lot therefore had good reason&nbsp;to observe it as an anniversary of great significance for him&nbsp;also. Compare the numerous commentaries on Genesis&nbsp;14,15, ויחלק עליהם לילה, “He divided the night for them.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah,</span><span class="font5"> 11 both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yoshua are quoted as in agreement that three&nbsp;previously barren women, i.e. Sarah, Rachel and Chanah, all&nbsp;became pregnant on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בקרבה</span><span class="font5">, “in her heart and mind;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאמור</span><span class="font5">, what is the meaning of this word, which literally means: “to say;” [apparently contradicting the previous word,&nbsp;Ed.] According to the plain meaning we should assume that&nbsp;this word here is no different from elsewhere where it&nbsp;appears and means that certain thoughts were to be voiced&nbsp;by mouth. Sarah then would have prepared to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">voice</span><span class="font5"> her&nbsp;opinion of the prophecy which had not come true. In other&nbsp;words: she was ready to voice her ridicule publicly. This&nbsp;would account for the fact that the Torah took her to task for&nbsp;her disbelief more so than it had taken to task Avraham in&nbsp;Genesis 17,17, where he is reported to have reacted&nbsp;similarly to the promise by G’d that Sarah would become the&nbsp;mother of a son of his. However, he had not intended to go&nbsp;public with his doubts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחרי בלותי</span><span class="font5">, “after I have ceased menstruating?” Sarah is almost incredulous that nature would reverse itself in her&nbsp;case. She adds that even assuming that she has&nbsp;experienced this kind of rejuvenation, she knows from her&nbsp;personal experience that her husband has not experienced&nbsp;such symptoms. This latter thought of Sarah is the one the&nbsp;Torah did not reveal to Avraham, not wishing to cause friction&nbsp;between Sarah and her husband by revealing that she&nbsp;considered him impotent. If you wonder about the Torah’s&nbsp;choice of the expression היתה לי, “I have experienced,” in the&nbsp;past tense, instead of the expression תהיה לי, in the future&nbsp;tense, this is something we find quite often in the Holy&nbsp;Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,13. למה זה צחקה</span><span class="font5">, “why is it that she ridiculed, etc.?”&nbsp;[the author now repeats something he had already explained,&nbsp;at the top of this page, offering an alternate explanation. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If you were to ask why G’d did not rebuke Avraham when he entertained similar doubts in Genesis 17,17, the&nbsp;answer is that seeing that Sarah is considered as on a lower&nbsp;spiritual level than her husband, it is considered as clear that&nbsp;if </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">even</span><span class="font5"> her doubts were criticised, her husband’s doubts were&nbsp;deserving of a rebuke even more so, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> the need for the&nbsp;Torah to spell this out. Our author uses a parable to&nbsp;demonstrate this point, writing that when a wise woman&nbsp;wishes to rebuke her daughter-in-law for something both she&nbsp;and her daughter had been guilty of, she rebukes only her&nbsp;daughter instead, allowing her daughter-in-law to draw the&nbsp;necessary conclusions about her own behaviour. If G’d had&nbsp;rebuked Avraham in Sarah’s presence, he would have felt&nbsp;ashamed; He therefore did so in an indirect manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואני זקנתי</span><span class="font5">, “seeing that I am too old?” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">the Torah changed what Sarah had actually said out of&nbsp;concern for the harmony existing between Avraham and&nbsp;Sarah. What Sarah had actually meant was: “what good&nbsp;does it do for me to have been rejuvenated as long as my&nbsp;husband cannot be rejuvenated also?” How can I become&nbsp;pregnant from hjs seed? Had the Torah conveyed this&nbsp;thought to Avraham it would have meant that it was only</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Avraham’s inadequacy that prevented Sarah from having a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,14. היפלא מה׳ דבר</span><span class="font5">, “Is there then anything that goes on in My world that I am not aware of or in charge of? G’d&nbsp;teaches Avraham that He can hear even laughter that has&nbsp;only occurred in the heart or mind, without ever having&nbsp;crossed one’s lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למועד, </span><span class="font5">the numerical value of the letters in this word when totaled amounts to the same as the numerical value of&nbsp;the word: בפסח, i.e. 150. (Compare what we wrote on verse&nbsp;12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,15. </span><span class="font5">ותכחש שרה לאמור, “Sarah denied the accusation, saying, etc.” this is the origin of the Rabbinic ruling that in&nbsp;most matters women are not acceptable as witnesses, as our&nbsp;matriarch Sarah had been guilty of lying to the Almighty. How&nbsp;much more would women lie to judges? Their lies are not&nbsp;due to their using falsehood as a way of life, but they are&nbsp;more easily intimidated than men, so that sometimes they tell&nbsp;lies to escape a harsh fate. Sarah, when becoming aware&nbsp;that her innermost thoughts were known to G’d, was&nbsp;suddenly very fearful [possibly recalling other occasions&nbsp;when she had had unbecoming thoughts though she had not&nbsp;voiced them. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יראה, </span><span class="font5">“for she had become afraid;” some commentators, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin</span><span class="font5"> folio 90 included,&nbsp;claim that every time the word כי occurs in the Torah it ought&nbsp;to be translated as ארי, meaning that just as the word כי can&nbsp;have four </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">different</span><span class="font5"> meanings in the Hebrew language so it&nbsp;has the same four different meanings in the Aramaic&nbsp;language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[The author proceeds why this must have been the meaning of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5">; seeing that readers who have neither&nbsp;command of the Hebrew or the Aramaic language will not&nbsp;appreciate these nuances, I have omitted translating them.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,16</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישקיפו על פני סדום</span><span class="font5">, “they looked down at the city of Sodom facing them;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> every time when&nbsp;the expression: השקפה occurs in the Holy Scriptures it has a&nbsp;negative connotation with the exception of Deuteronomy&nbsp;26,15: השקיפה ממעון קדשך, “look down benignly from Your holy&nbsp;residence in heaven.” Our author questions </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> by quoting&nbsp;Song of Songs: 6,10, מי זאת הנשקפת, “who is she who shines&nbsp;like the dawn,” as not having a negative connotation; he also&nbsp;quotes: Lamentations 3,50: עד ישקיף ויראה, “until He looks&nbsp;down from heaven and beholds;” a third example where the&nbsp;word השקפה occurs in a benign mode is Psalms 85,12 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וצדק&nbsp;משמים נשקף</span><span class="font5">, “and righteousness looks down from heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הולך עמם לשלחם, </span><span class="font5">“kept walking with them to see them off.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the reason that the Torah uses this&nbsp;formulation is that Avraham still thought that these creatures&nbsp;were his guests. He thought so in spite of the fact that they&nbsp;made a [for mortals presumptuous] statement that they&nbsp;guaranteed that they would return at that time in the following&nbsp;years, a statement that no mortal can make and be taken&nbsp;seriously. He assumed that though the person making this&nbsp;promise was mortal, he was a prophet and spoke as a&nbsp;messenger of G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואברהם היה יהיה....כי ידעתיו</span><span class="font5">, “seeing that Avraham is&nbsp;destined to become....for I have become intimate with him,&nbsp;etc.;” the word: ידע describes special fondness someone has.&nbsp;A well known example is Ruth 3,2 where Naomi tells her&nbsp;daughter-in-law Ruth that Boaz was a close relative of hers,&nbsp;מודע לאיש, and that it was fortuitous that she had collected&nbsp;leftovers in hjs field. G’d explains that seeing that Avraham&nbsp;will become the founding father of a great nation, and many&nbsp;branch families, it was no more than fair that He should take&nbsp;him into His confidence. This included first and foremost how&nbsp;G’d was planning to deal with the city of Sodom and its&nbsp;inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;למען אשר יצוה את בניו ואת ביתו</span><span class="font5">, “in order that he will&nbsp;command his sons and the members of his household, etc.”&nbsp;He should point out to them that unless they followed their&nbsp;father’s or master’s tradition, they might wind us just as the&nbsp;people of Sodom would in short order. [Note that here as well&nbsp;as at the time of the deluge, G’d was not punishing these&nbsp;people for their paganism but for not dealing fairly with one&nbsp;another. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,21.הכצעקתה הבאה אלי עשו</span><span class="font5">, If they really have acted as wickedly as the complaints that have reached Me;” while it is&nbsp;true that everything is an open book for Me, nonetheless the&nbsp;attribute of Mercy has requested that I exercise My power of&nbsp;Mercy for them;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואם לא אדעה</span><span class="font5">, but it not, i.e. if </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">some</span><span class="font5"> excuse can be found for their behaviour, I will take note of it, “and will have mercy&nbsp;on them at this time.” The formulation here is parallel to&nbsp;Exodus 2,25, when G’d took pity on His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בתוך העיר, </span><span class="font5">“within the city;” a reference to the city&nbsp;of Sodom itself. The King of Sodom was chief over satellite&nbsp;towns also, even though these satellite towns had nominally&nbsp;“kings” of their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!חלילה לך</span><span class="font5">, “far be it from You!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> comment&nbsp;on these words [their repetition, Ed.] based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma,</span><span class="font5"> is:&nbsp;לעולם הבא, “even in future generations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לך</span><span class="font5">, seeing that this word was also repeated by Avraham we may assume that the first time he addressed the&nbsp;masculine attributes of the Lord, and the second time he&nbsp;addressed the feminine attributes. [Avraham does not imply&nbsp;that G’d could judge unfairly; he -like Moses after him-reminds G’d of how He will be perceived by His subjects, i.e.&nbsp;as subjecting them to collective punishment. The fact that the&nbsp;first time the letter ל is vocalised with a semi vowel under the&nbsp;letter, and the second time that letter is vocalised with a full&nbsp;vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz,</span><span class="font5"> was the nuance leading to this interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,28. אם אמצא שם ארבעים וחמשה</span><span class="font5">, “If I find there 45 just men,” if you were to ask why Avraham, who apparently was&nbsp;haggling, lowered the ante by five, whereas after going down&nbsp;to 40, he lowered it by ten each time? We must remember&nbsp;that his requests were not the same each time. He had never&nbsp;intended to ask for any town to be saved if it did not contain&nbsp;at least ten just men. How was this to work? First Avraham&nbsp;asked for the 5 towns to be saved on the understanding that&nbsp;each town had at least 10 just men. He then asked that if in&nbsp;each of these towns there were only nine such just men that&nbsp;G’d Himself would consider Himself as the tenth. He then&nbsp;tried to save the maximum number of people by asking that&nbsp;the towns not be considered collectively but individually, i.e.&nbsp;that a total of 40 just men evenly divided between four of the&nbsp;town should save these four towns. This is why he stopped&nbsp;when assured by G’d that even only ten men, as long as they&nbsp;were all part of one town, would be enough to save the&nbsp;inhabitants of that town. He thought that Lot, his wife, his four&nbsp;daughters and four sons-in-law, would make up this quorum&nbsp;of ten people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different version of what Avraham had in mind: when Avraham saw that G’d agreed to his first two requests, he&nbsp;realised that a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">total</span><span class="font5"> of 45 just people would suffice to save&nbsp;the inhabitants of aJi these five towns and their respective&nbsp;inhabitants could be treated as five separate units. He&nbsp;proceeded to treat each town as a fifth of his total request.&nbsp;This is why he explored what the minimum number of just&nbsp;people had to be to secure the survival of the inhabitants of&nbsp;at least one of these towns. In practice, Avraham at first&nbsp;asked for very little, making a greater demand on G’d’s&nbsp;mercy every time he continued to reduce the total number&nbsp;needed to save part of these communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,30. אל נא יחר </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">לאדני</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ואדברה</span><span class="font5">, “may my Lord not become angry if I continue to bargain;” in the verses 30,31,and 32,&nbsp;the word א-דון is to be treated as one of the names of G’d, i.e.&nbsp;the attributes which must not be erased in a Torah scroll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,1. ויבאו שני המלאכים</span><span class="font5">, “the two angels arrived, etc.;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points out that when these two individuals arrived in&nbsp;Eloney Mamre in front of Avraham’s tent, the Torah had&nbsp;referred to them as אנשים, men, mortal human beings,&nbsp;whereas now they are described as angels. If you were to&nbsp;counter that in the ensuing argument between the&nbsp;townspeople and Lot they are also described as אנשים,&nbsp;(verses 5,8,12) this sentence has to be understood as&nbsp;follows: “the ones whom the men of the city called אנשים,&nbsp;“men of substance, etc;” the whole dialogue must be&nbsp;understood thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternately; Lot is saying to his fellow citizens: “do not do any harm to the guests in my house to whom you refer as&nbsp;אנשים. He realised that whereas he had recognised these&nbsp;individuals as angels, his fellow citizens obviously had not.&nbsp;This explanation is also applicable to verse 16, ויחזיקו האנשים,&nbsp;“the men” took hold of, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולוט יושב בשער סדום</span><span class="font5">, while Lot was seated (as a judge) in the public square of Sodom;” this was at the time when the&nbsp;quarrel about his guests broke out and he returned home,&nbsp;which was close to the gate of the city. This is why he could&nbsp;be so insistent when inviting the angels (verse 3) as the area&nbsp;was narrow and not exposed to the influence of the evil eye.&nbsp;No one was familiar with the layout of his house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,2. ולינו</span><span class="font5">, “and spend the night (in my house);” he brought them into his house without delay before the people&nbsp;of Sodom could see them, and subsequently could identify&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורחצו רגליכם</span><span class="font5">, “and wash your feet.” This was an additional precaution, as he reasoned if any of the&nbsp;townspeople will see their dusty feet they will realise that&nbsp;they recently arrived from beyond the city gates. This will&nbsp;cause the townspeople to investigate these men further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולינו ורחצו, “</span><span class="font5">spend the night and wash;” an unusual request, as most people wash (their feet) before going to bed&nbsp;at night. Besides we have it on the authority of Avraham who&nbsp;had asked the same men to first wash the dust off their feet&nbsp;before having lunch with him. (18,4) We therefore must&nbsp;understand Lot as follows: “if the men enter the house </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">having washed their feet, and they are seen as having clean&nbsp;feet, the townspeople will be suspicious believing that Lot&nbsp;had harboured guests secretly for several days already&nbsp;without their knowledge. He reasoned that the lesser evil is&nbsp;having these men sleep with dirty feet for one night than to&nbsp;provoke an altercation with the townspeople. Knowing of this&nbsp;danger, Lot added that the men (angels) should rise early&nbsp;and leave before they could be detected as guests of his.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כי ברחוב נלין</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">for we will spend the night outdoors.” When the angels realised how scared Lot was to give them&nbsp;shelter for even one night, they declined his invitation,&nbsp;suggesting that they would take care of themselves even&nbsp;when remaining in the street, visible to all. They considered it&nbsp;appropriate to be seen by the people whom they had been&nbsp;sent to destroy together with their miserable city. If they&nbsp;would begin to realise this, perhaps they would become&nbsp;penitents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מנער ועד זקן</span><span class="font5">, “both young and old.” Seeing that all&nbsp;of them were wicked, Avraham had not received an&nbsp;assurance beyond a minimum of ten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.5. ונדעה אותם, “</span><span class="font5">so that we may engage in homosexual relations with them;” the word ידע is familiar to&nbsp;us from Genesis 4,1 where it described Adam in engaging in&nbsp;carnal relations with Chavah. Besides, it is clear from Lot’s&nbsp;offer of his two virgin daughters as an alternative to satisfy&nbsp;the carnal desires of the men of Sodom (19,8), that these&nbsp;men were planning a criminal activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר לא ידעו איש</span><span class="font5">, “who have not had carnal relations&nbsp;with any man.” According to proper grammar, Lot should&nbsp;have said: אשר לא ידען איש, “with whom no man had had&nbsp;carnal relations;” seeing that it is usually the male who&nbsp;seduces the female; however the daughters of Lot were not&nbsp;chaste and did not shy away from engaging in seducing men,&nbsp;as we know from later when they initiated carnal relations&nbsp;with their own father. (20,33) Their descendants, the&nbsp;daughters of Midian, kept up the tradition when they seduced&nbsp;the Israelite males in the desert (Numbers 31,17) As a result&nbsp;all the female Midianite prisoners who had lost their virginity&nbsp;were not allowed to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי על כן</span><span class="font5">, “for on account of” (their not wishing to be disturbed, they came to my house for shelter).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.9. </span><span class="font5">עתה נרע לך מהם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“now we will treat you even worse&nbsp;than them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,13. כי משחיתים אנחנו</span><span class="font5">, “for we are about to destroy, etc.” Throughout the mission of the angels they are referred&nbsp;to in the singular mode. (Compare 18,10; 19,17, 19,22) Here&nbsp;the Torah used the plural mode. Why? Seeing that the Torah&nbsp;had used the plural mode (verse 21) it used the same mode&nbsp;here also when the subject is the destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישלחנו</span><span class="font5">, “He has sent us;” this word is in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">piel </span><span class="font5">conjugation with a dot in the letter ל, although the word&nbsp;normally is used in the conjugation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kal</span><span class="font5"> and without the dot,&nbsp;when the mission on which the messenger has been sent is&nbsp;a two way mission, i.e. he has to come back with an answer&nbsp;or something tangible before the mission is considered as&nbsp;complete, in this instance we find that the conjugation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">piel a&nbsp;“strong”</span><span class="font5"> conjugation has been used as the mission was one&nbsp;of destruction. Another such example is found in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 32,24: ושן בהמות אשלח בם, “and fanged beasts&nbsp;will I let loose against them.” Still another such example is&nbsp;Psalms 78,45: ישלח בהם ערוב, He dispatched against them&nbsp;wild beasts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכמו השחר עלה</span><span class="font5">, “and as dawn was about to rise,&nbsp;etc.” this verse was written as if describing an event in the&nbsp;future, as the Torah wished to portray for how long the&nbsp;angels delayed carrying out their mission involving the dual&nbsp;task of destroying Sodom and saving Lot, the latter not&nbsp;having been completed until after sunrise, as is clear from&nbsp;verse 23 where Lot’s arrival in Tzoar is reported. The angels&nbsp;delayed because of their fondness for Avraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Chanina is quoted as having said (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 50,10) that the time between dawn rising and the&nbsp;sun rising is equivalent to the distance a normal person can&nbsp;walk a distance of about 1200 meters. He used verse 23 as&nbsp;the basis for his statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויוציאה</span><span class="font5">, “they took him outside;” there is a letter ו&nbsp;missing before letter ה, to hint that only one angel, i.e. ויוציא,&nbsp;singular, the angel Gavriel, had been charged with the task&nbsp;of saving Lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי כהוציאם אותם החוצה</span><span class="font5">, “and it was as he took&nbsp;them outside;” the word אותם appears superfluous, as it is&nbsp;included in the plural suffix ם; the reason it was added was to&nbsp;emphasise that the angel only took Lot, his wife and the two&nbsp;daughters who were still unmarried. They were not allowed&nbsp;to take with them any of their belongings. The spelling of the&nbsp;verse is to teach us that Lot was so “married” to his material&nbsp;possessions that he could not face having to become&nbsp;separated from these. We have a similarly strange sounding&nbsp;grammatical formulation in Numbers 14,32: ופגרכם אתם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">and&nbsp;you who are living corpses;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis for the expression: ויהי כאשר הוציאם; the word is not exclusive but inclusive, i.e. “when the&nbsp;angel took Lot and his family out, etc.;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל תביט אחריך</span><span class="font5">, “literally: “do not look behind you;” the reference is not to what one sees with one’s eyes, but to&nbsp;what one sees with one’s mind’s eye, i.e. leaving behind&nbsp;other members of one’s family. The angel warned Lot to&nbsp;move forward with all possible speed, not allowing any other&nbsp;consideration to slow him down. The reason was that the&nbsp;cloud containing the lethal particles had already risen and&nbsp;was unstoppable. It would discharge its contents all over the&nbsp;region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל תביט</span><span class="font5">, “do not look!” Although the command is issued in the singular mode, [presumably Lot’s wife and daughters&nbsp;did not qualify for being addressed by an angel. Ed.] the&nbsp;warning was meant for each of the members of Lot’s family&nbsp;also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find a parallel example of such a formulation in Genesis 2,17: ומעץ הדעת טוב ורע לא תאכל ממנו, where the&nbsp;prohibition to eat from the tree of knowledge is addressed to&nbsp;Adam in the singular mode, although it was intended both for&nbsp;him and his wife. This is the reason why Adam’s wife was&nbsp;punished for eating from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל תביט</span><span class="font5">, the letter ב has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chink,</span><span class="font5"> (instead of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzeyre.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל נא אדוני</span><span class="font5">, “not so my lord.” The word: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">adoni&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">here is not sacred (attribute of Divinity). This is why the verse&nbsp;ends with this word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Subsequently, Lot turns to G’d, and prays: “seeing that Your servant has found favour in Your eyes, etc. “ (Talmud,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot, 35)</span><span class="font5"> According to our tradition, the word אדני is&nbsp;sacred, according to that version, we vocalise the letter נ with&nbsp;a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;פן תדבקני הרעה, </span><span class="font5">“so that the disaster will not catch&nbsp;up with me.” He was afraid of the brimstone and sulphur that&nbsp;was beginning to spread all around him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.21. גם לדבר הזה</span><span class="font5">, “also to this request.” This is the&nbsp;angel speaking after Lot reminded him that it was his task to&nbsp;save him. Lot speaking: “In addition to the mere fact that you&nbsp;have the task to save me, I ask you to delay destruction of&nbsp;Tzoar until I can reach higher ground.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.24.</span><span class="font5"> המטיר על סדום, “made it rain on Sodom, etc.” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this occurred at an hour when both the&nbsp;sun were visible in the sky; according to him the reason was&nbsp;that some of the Sodomites worshipped the sun, others the&nbsp;moon. If both were visible at the time of this disaster, they&nbsp;would all recognise the powerlessness of their deities to&nbsp;protect them against such disasters emanating in the&nbsp;heavenly regions. The basis of this exegesis is that the Torah&nbsp;does not use the immediate past tense, i.e. וימטר, but uses a&nbsp;pluperfect, המטיר, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">had</span><span class="font5"> made it rain.” The “Passover” had&nbsp;already commenced on the previous evening before the&nbsp;angels had reached Sodom. [Compare 18,12 on the cosmic&nbsp;significance of that night. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'מאת ה, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 51,3, this is to be understood as the angel Gavriel and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> dividing the&nbsp;labour; the former set these harmful substances in motion,&nbsp;the region it emanated from was provided by the Lord&nbsp;Himself. [The reason why our sages understand more than&nbsp;one celestial force to have been involved is the connective&nbsp;letter ו at the beginning of the word: 'וה. Ed.] According to an&nbsp;early version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma</span><span class="font5"> on this verse, the first time the&nbsp;name </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> is used in this verse it refers to the angel&nbsp;Gavriel, whereas the second time it refers to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהפוך את הערים</span><span class="font5">, “He overturned the cities;” it is&nbsp;clear from this verse that the destruction of these cities&nbsp;preceded Sarah’s death, whereas in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">109 we read the opposite. The Talmud there relates; Eliezer&nbsp;the servant of Avraham once passed the place where Sodom&nbsp;had been located. He was invited to rest on a bed. He replied&nbsp;that he had made a vow ever since Sarah had died not to&nbsp;ever rest on a bed again. From this it is clear that Sarah had&nbsp;already died. We therefore have to assume that Eliezer was&nbsp;speaking about the town of Tzoar, one of the satellite towns&nbsp;of Sodom which had been spared by the prayer of Lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וצמח </span><span class="font5">האדמה, “and the vegetation on the ground.” Rabbi Yoshua son of Levi stated that when a person takes soil from&nbsp;a piece of land that once was Sodom and he transplants it, it&nbsp;will never grow anything again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,26. ותהיא נציב מלח, </span><span class="font5">“she was turned into a pillar of salt;” her punishment fitted her crime, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has&nbsp;explained. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> claims that when her husband asked his&nbsp;wife to give some salt to his guests so that their food would&nbsp;taste better, she absolutely refused by challenging his right to&nbsp;violate the laws of Sodom concerning the entertaining of any&nbsp;guests. (based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah,50,4)</span><span class="font5"> She was punished&nbsp;with the same punishment as the cities of Sodom, which&nbsp;were turned into salt as mentioned by Moses in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 29,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישקף על פני סדום</span><span class="font5">, “he looked down in the direction&nbsp;of Sodom” to see if 10 just people had been found that were&nbsp;deserving of being saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר ישב בהן לוט</span><span class="font5">, “in which Lot used to live;” he&nbsp;had not lived in all of them but in one of them. We find a&nbsp;similar construction in Judges 12,7, where Yiftach is reported&nbsp;as having been buried “in the cities of Gilead,” and it clearly&nbsp;does not mean that he had been cut up and been buried in&nbsp;different parts of the region of Gilead. [The Book of Judges&nbsp;merely makes the point that any of these cities would have&nbsp;been proud to have provided his grave. Ed.] Compare also&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zachariah 9,9:</span><span class="font5"> ועל עיר בן אתונות, “and on a male donkey foaled&nbsp;by one of the she-asses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ירא לשבת בצוער</span><span class="font5">, “for he was afraid of taking up&nbsp;residence in Tzoar.” The angel had saved Tzoar only&nbsp;temporarily until Lot would recover sufficiently to escape to&nbsp;the mountain. As soon as he would have done so, he&nbsp;became afraid that the angel would complete the task of&nbsp;destroying it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,33. ותשכב את אביה</span><span class="font5">, “she had carnal relations with her father;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> what she did was not admissible;&nbsp;if you were to argue that we have a statement in the Talmud&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Kamma</span><span class="font5"> 38, according to which her conduct was to&nbsp;teach us that she was praised for being the first of the two&nbsp;sisters to fulfill this commandment, the meaning is that if&nbsp;something inadmissible (basically) has to be undertaken due&nbsp;to circumstances, the person who is the first to do so is given&nbsp;special credit. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> criticises the fact that objectively&nbsp;speaking, she committed incest. [According to the rules&nbsp;about incest, as stipulated in Maimonides, gentile daughters&nbsp;are allowed to have carnal relations with their fathers, based&nbsp;on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 58] According to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mechilta,</span><span class="font5"> the fact that&nbsp;they found wine in the cave was a sign for them that what&nbsp;they did had heavenly approval. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובקומה</span><span class="font5">, “and when she got up;” there is a dot above this word. [as opposed to the same word when the Torah&nbsp;describes her sister’s breaking off that intimacy with her&nbsp;father. That word is also spelled without the letter ו when&nbsp;describing the completion of the act of the younger sister.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,36.ומהרין שתי בנות לוט</span><span class="font5">, “the two daughters of Lot became pregnant;” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> although normally&nbsp;virgins do not become pregnant from the first time they have&nbsp;carnal relations, these two girls had first removed their&nbsp;hymens, so as to enable them to conceive from the first&nbsp;intercourse with a male. [The author refers to an obscure&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> according to which the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ervah,</span><span class="font5"> used as&nbsp;synonym for genitals, is spelled wit the letter ד instead of the&nbsp;letter ו, i.e. instead of עדותן ,עדותן as their “proof,” that they&nbsp;had been virgins prior to this. This is based on Deuteronomy&nbsp;22,17 where the mother of a daughter whose newly wedded&nbsp;husband had accused her daughter of not entering marriage&nbsp;as a virgin by saying: “here is the proof that my daughter was&nbsp;a virgin when she married you.” Ed.] At any rate, Lot’s&nbsp;daughters, through tricks known to girls, contorted&nbsp;themselves in a manner that could serve them as “proof” that&nbsp;they had been innocent virgins up to that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,38. והצעירה גם היא</span><span class="font5">, “and the younger sister did also give birth to a son;” the reason this is reported in a separate&nbsp;verse, is to signal that her son too would be originator of a&nbsp;family destined to produce kings. A distant descendant of her&nbsp;was Naamah who became the mother of Rechavam, son of&nbsp;Solomon (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Kamma,</span><span class="font5"> 38).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסע משם</span><span class="font5">, “he moved away from there.” He moved&nbsp;away from Eloney Mamre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר אברהם אל אשתו, </span><span class="font5">“Avraham said to his wife:”&nbsp;when speaking in her presence he said that she was his&nbsp;sister, while she kept quiet. [the word is considered here as&nbsp;the same as “על,” about; Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הנך מת</span><span class="font5">, “you are about to die;” G’d’s dealings with&nbsp;Avimelech prove that gentiles do not have to be cautioned&nbsp;not to commit acts which they know to be punishable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואבימלך לא קרב אליה</span><span class="font5">, “while Avimelech had not&nbsp;become intimate with her.” [but he had kidnapped her, Ed.]&nbsp;The reason why the Torah had to emphasise this latter point,&nbsp;i.e. that Avimelech had not violated Sarah sexually, is the&nbsp;fact that her being kidnapped occurred so close to her&nbsp;becoming pregnant with Yitzchok.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמר א־דני</span><span class="font5">, He said: ”My Lord,” i.e. this word is treated as the holy name of G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">?הגוי גם צדיק תהרוג, “</span><span class="font5">Are You killing people even if they are innocent?” The verse appears as an abbreviated version&nbsp;of Avimelech’s thoughts. The full version would be: הגם גוי&nbsp;צדיק תהרוג?</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">Are You also going to kill an innocent nation?”&nbsp;The word גם appears in the Torah quite often as part of such&nbsp;an abbreviated formulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of this verse: the word, “also,” is treated as someone or something additional i.e. “if You kill&nbsp;me (Avimelech describes himself as if only one of the&nbsp;common people) then you must also kill Avraham the&nbsp;righteous person for having misled me. Had he not described&nbsp;her as his sister I would not have abducted her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיא גם היא</span><span class="font5">, the word היא is spelled with the letter י.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיא גם היא</span><span class="font5">, “and she </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">also</span><span class="font5"> referred to Avraham as her brother not only in public but also when they were alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עשיתי זאת</span><span class="font5">, “have I done this.” This refers to his having kidnapped Sarah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to a different interpretation, G’d was content with warning Avimelech because he had taken the trouble to&nbsp;investigate Sarah’s marital status. Pharaoh who had not&nbsp;bothered to do so, was struck with a plague immediately.&nbsp;(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor</span><span class="font5"> on end of verse 16.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,6. גם אנכי ידעתי כי בתם לבבך וגו</span><span class="font5">׳, “also I am aware that you have acted innocently, etc;” G’d , by saying: גם, includes&nbsp;that not only does He know that Avimelech had not raped&nbsp;Sarah in his heart but that his hands had remained clean&nbsp;also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על כן</span><span class="font5">, this is why it was I Who prevented you from “getting your hands dirty;” I prevented you from touching her&nbsp;immodestly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,8. וייראו האנשים</span><span class="font5">, according to Rabbi Abba, the people of Gror still saw smoke rising from the valley where Sodom&nbsp;once used to be situated, and that frightened them very&nbsp;much. They were afraid that the angels who had wrought that&nbsp;havoc would show up near them at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,11. רק אין יראת</span><span class="font5">, “there is only no awe of the Lord, etc;” Avraham could have said that there was no fear of any&nbsp;retribution for criminal acts from a deity. There are three&nbsp;diminutives in this verse, i.e. the words: ,רק, אך and מן. We&nbsp;have a rule that one diminutive is designed to exclude&nbsp;something from the rule discussed, whereas two such&nbsp;diminutives are a signal that something additional is to be&nbsp;added. It follows that when there are tree diminutives, it&nbsp;again is meant to exclude something. In this instance&nbsp;Avraham acknowledged that there were things in the&nbsp;universe which the Philistines feared, but it was not judgment&nbsp;by an invisible G’d. Rabbi Chavell refers the reader to the&nbsp;comment on this verse cited in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah Shleymah #54.</span><span class="font5"> by an&nbsp;invisible G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,13. כאשר התעו אותי אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “When G’d caused me to wander, etc,” Avraham refers to the time after he had been&nbsp;saved from Nimrod’s furnace when that ruler had expelled&nbsp;him from his country. He had not really had a permanent&nbsp;residence anywhere ever since. He had only been relatively&nbsp;safe after having defeated Nimrod (Amrafel) and his armies&nbsp;as reported in Genesis chapter 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,16. הנה נתתי אלף כסף לאחיך</span><span class="font5">, “here I have given 1000 pieces of silver to your brother;” Avimelech uses the word&nbsp;“your brother” sarcastically, meaning that he had given this&nbsp;amount of money to the person whom she had described as&nbsp;her brother. It was customary in those days to give expensive&nbsp;gifts to a bride’s brother. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span><span class="font5"> (We find that Eliezer&nbsp;had done the same to Rivkah’s brother and family.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הנה הוא לך כסות עינים לכל אשר אתך</span><span class="font5">, “this is to enable you to call your husband your brother, i.e. as a cover up, but this is&nbsp;to be used only as an explanation to your immediate&nbsp;entourage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת כל</span><span class="font5">, but concerning the general population in my country you must not continue to describe your husband as&nbsp;your brother. Otherwise other people may become the&nbsp;victims of the same error I have become a victim of. The&nbsp;letter ו in the word: ונוכחת is superfluous, as are numerous&nbsp;letters, [especially when the Torah quotes human beings&nbsp;rather than G’d as the speaker. Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Jerusalem Targum we find the following translation/exegesis: “the money I have given to your brother&nbsp;as compensation that he has been deprived of your presence&nbsp;for a single night; even if I would give you all my wealth it&nbsp;would not be enough to compensate you for the&nbsp;embarrassment that I have caused you. Suffice it to say that&nbsp;your husband Avraham is a righteous man who is aware that&nbsp;I have not violated you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הנה נתתי</span><span class="font5">, if I have only given 1000 pieces of silver and nothing else to the person whom&nbsp;you describe as your brother, this will serve as something&nbsp;small enough for him to hide, and you would become&nbsp;embarrassed because people would say that I have paid a&nbsp;bribe to your brother to keep him from raising a fuss, but they&nbsp;would still think that I have violated you. Now that I have also&nbsp;given you sheep and cattle, male and female slaves, openly,&nbsp;everyone will know that you and I have nothing to hide. You&nbsp;will be able to hold your head high and argue with everyone,&nbsp;seeing that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> hands are clean and I have returned you to&nbsp;your husband against my will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet another explanation of this difficult verse: “Your brother Avraham is the one that can serve as your blindfold.&nbsp;It was he who had hidden from one and all that he was your&nbsp;husband and that you were his wife. He had commanded&nbsp;your entire entourage to go along with this charade, You&nbsp;have also played along, so that my sin must be viewed in&nbsp;that context and not be considered as so severe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,17. וילדו</span><span class="font5">, “they gave birth.” Avimelech is not included in the statement: “they gave birth.” It refers only to the&nbsp;females mentioned in the verse. We have proof that this is&nbsp;the correct interpretation from Genesis 29,39 ויחמו הצאן,&nbsp;when the sheep were in heat, where the Torah uses the&nbsp;masculine mode, although obviously it was the female sheep&nbsp;which were in heat, as the male do not conceive and give&nbsp;birth. There is further proof that the expression וילדו, “they&nbsp;gave birth,” cannot refer to Avimelech personally, from verse&nbsp;18, where the Torah relates that while Sarah was in&nbsp;Avimelech’s palace, captive, all the women in his household,&nbsp;had been unable to give birth though highly pregnant. After&nbsp;Avraham prayed for Avimelech, G’d healed them so that they&nbsp;all gave birth simultaneously as a sign of G’d’s intervention.&nbsp;Another example of a similar formulation in the Torah, -which&nbsp;at first glance appears incredible- is in Genesis 30,26, where&nbsp;after the birth of Joseph, and completion of a total of 14&nbsp;years of service to Lavan, Yaakov demands: תנה את נשי ואת&nbsp;ילדי אשר עבדתי אותך בהן, “Hand over my wives and my children&nbsp;for whom I have served you!” Yaakov had served Lavan only&nbsp;for his wives, not for his children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,1. וה' פקד את שרה</span><span class="font5">, “and after </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> had taken due note of Sarah, etc;” whenever in the Torah the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> is introduced with the prefix ו, meaning “and,” it is a&nbsp;hint that G’d did not act singlehandedly but in consonance&nbsp;with His heavenly Tribunal. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 51,2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 53,6 this function of the Heavenly Tribunal is dealt with at greater length, especially in&nbsp;connection with Numbers 5,28 where the subject is the&nbsp;woman whose husband accused her of violating a specific&nbsp;command not to be alone with a certain man. This woman&nbsp;denied that she had committed an indiscretion, and the&nbsp;Torah promises that if she told the truth, and drank from the&nbsp;“bitter” waters, she will be rewarded with bearing a child she&nbsp;had been unable to conceive prior to this scandal. It is foolish&nbsp;to raise the question that since we know that G’d had known&nbsp;the truth all along, just as He does all the time, why was a&nbsp;miracle needed to demonstrate this truth? Her husband had&nbsp;not known, nor had her peers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את שרה</span><span class="font5">, the word את here seems superfluous, as we do not hear about other barren women suddenly becoming&nbsp;pregnant at the same time. As a result of Avraham having&nbsp;prayed for the women in Avimelech’s palace to be able to&nbsp;give birth, even though his own wife had been unable to do&nbsp;so, he was rewarded in that she now became pregnant. All&nbsp;other barren women at the time were also now able to&nbsp;conceive. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah Shleymah,</span><span class="font5"> 11, on this verse).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר אמר, </span><span class="font5">“as He had said,” when the angel said that he would return around the same time in the following year and&nbsp;by then Sarah would have a baby. (Genesis 18,10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר דבר</span><span class="font5">, “as He had spoken.” A reference to a previous prophecy in Genesis 15,18, when G’d had concluded His first&nbsp;covenant with Avraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,2. למועד </span><span class="font5">אשר </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דבר, </span><span class="font5">at the appointed time He had spoken of. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this refers to 18,14. According&nbsp;to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma,</span><span class="font5"> Avraham scratched a line in&nbsp;the sundial in order to check in due course whether Yitzchok&nbsp;would be born at that hour of day. (or to when she would&nbsp;become pregnant). If so how could we have a disagreement&nbsp;in the Talmud as to whether Yitzchok was born in Nissan or&nbsp;in Tishrey? Seeing that both Nissan and Tishrey share the&nbsp;same equinox this is quite possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,7. מי מלל</span><span class="font5">, “who would have dared predict that the day would come when I would nurse children?” If someone had&nbsp;predicted this he would not have been believed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויעש אברהם משתה גדול</span><span class="font5">, “Avraham prepared a great&nbsp;feast.” This was the custom in those days, -as opposed to&nbsp;nowadays when the feast is prepared on the day of the&nbsp;circumcision- compare Samuel I 1,24, when Chanah took her&nbsp;two year old son to the High Priest Eli after having weaned&nbsp;him. She took with her oxen and sheep to offer as a sacrifice&nbsp;in the Temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את בן הגר מצחק</span><span class="font5">, “showing off in front of his younger&nbsp;brother, as older brothers are wont to do.” (Ibn Ezra) Sarah,&nbsp;Yitzchok’s mother, could not stand her son being belittled by&nbsp;Ishmael. She was deeply offended by Ishmael’s behaviour,&nbsp;presumably encouraged by his mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי לא יירש</span><span class="font5">, “for he will not have a share in the&nbsp;inheritance;” it appears clear from this remark of Sarah that&nbsp;Ishmael had claimed a double portion of his eventual&nbsp;inheritance based on the fact that he was his father’s&nbsp;firstborn son. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 53,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,14. ויקח לחם וחמת מים</span><span class="font5">, “he took bread and hose full </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font5">water.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points out that he did not give Hagar silver or&nbsp;gold, as he himself had grown to dislike Ishmael, seeing that&nbsp;he had become a degenerate. Besides, at this stage&nbsp;Avraham did not have any “inheritance” at his disposal that&nbsp;he could give away, seeing that he himself was only a&nbsp;stranger in the land, just as was his son Ishmael. We have&nbsp;learned in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kidushin</span><span class="font5"> 17 that when a father and a&nbsp;son convert to Judaism they are both “strangers,” i.e.&nbsp;converts, but no longer legally considered as related to one&nbsp;another. As a result, there does not exist a “father-son”&nbsp;relationship to base any inheritance claim on. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Choshen&nbsp;Mishpot</span><span class="font5"> 283) Nonetheless, it had been Avraham’s intention&nbsp;after Sarah’s death to give his son Ishmael “gifts,” as&nbsp;opposed to an inheritance, as is clear from how he treated&nbsp;the sons of Keturah, his concubine after Sarah’s death (and&nbsp;Yitzchok having married and having received his full&nbsp;inheritance. Genesis 25,5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">שם על שכמה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“he placed on Hagar’s shoulder;” this refers to the bread and the hose of water. [Not as most&nbsp;commentators assume to Ishmael. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת הילד, </span><span class="font5">“and the boy;” he made sure that she held him by her hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Ishmael had been taken ill, so that Hagar had to carry him also. If you were to argue that we&nbsp;have been taught that sickness did not exist until Yaakov&nbsp;was on his deathbed, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Baba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> 87) we must assume&nbsp;that the Talmud refers to terminal sickness, but that did not&nbsp;include dying from thirst, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישלחה</span><span class="font5">, “he sent her off,” into freedom since having been intimate with her he was not allowed to sell her to&nbsp;another owner according to Torah law. (Compare Exodus&nbsp;21,11-14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,15. ויכלו המים מן החמת</span><span class="font5">, “the water in the hose ran out,” before they reached an inn. Avraham had provided only&nbsp;enough water for them to reach the nearest settlement of&nbsp;human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותשלך את הילד</span><span class="font5">, “she abandoned the child,” (by leaving him among some bushes) she did not do so because she&nbsp;could no longer carry him; she did so because he was about&nbsp;to die from thirst; when he first took sick she had carried him&nbsp;for a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,17. את קול הנער</span><span class="font5">, “the voice of the lad;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> uses this line to state that the prayer of a sick person on his own&nbsp;behalf reaches heaven faster than the prayers of others on&nbsp;his behalf. If you were to counter that the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">5 teaches that a prisoner cannot liberate himself from jail,&nbsp;[that he needs outsiders to do that for him, Ed,] what is&nbsp;meant is that the state of mind of the average sick person is&nbsp;such that he cannot pray with the required devotion. If he&nbsp;could, G’d will respond to him first. (Rabbeinu Ovadiah&nbsp;mibartenura)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באשר הוא שם</span><span class="font5">, “due to the condition he found himself in;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> the “condition” referred to is his&nbsp;legal/moral condition. He had not been wicked enough as yet&nbsp;to deserve to die on account of that. If you were to ask that&nbsp;the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin,72</span><span class="font5"> when stating that a 13 year boy&nbsp;who has committed a far lesser offense is to be stoned to&nbsp;death to prevent him from becoming a far more guilty person,&nbsp;(the rebellious son) the difference there is that that son had&nbsp;already begun his career as a teenager by committing&nbsp;criminal deeds, whereas at that age Ishmael had voluntarily&nbsp;submitted to circumcision, something for which he deserved&nbsp;a great deal of credit. [I have departed from the author’s text&nbsp;somewhat by pointing to a great merit acquired by Ishmael.&nbsp;Ed.] He had not exhausted that merit at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באשר הוא שם</span><span class="font5">, seeing he was “there,” as opposed to “here;” Hagar had distanced herself from her dying son to&nbsp;avoid having to watch his death throes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A totally different interpretation: “even though He was in a desert with no chance of obtaining water.” The emphasis is&nbsp;on the word הוא, a reference to G’d Who can provide&nbsp;everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישב במדבר</span><span class="font5">, “he settled in the desert.” This is why&nbsp;he had been described as פרא אדם, (Genesis 16,12, where&nbsp;the angel predicted his birth) He was a loner, shunning&nbsp;civilized society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהי רבה קשת</span><span class="font5">, “he became a professional hunter with bow and arrow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותקח לו אמו אשה מארץ מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “His mother took an&nbsp;Egyptian woman to become his wife.” Presumably, this was a&nbsp;woman, or a daughter of a woman whom she had known&nbsp;before joining Avraham and Sarah originally. According to&nbsp;Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 30, Yishmael first married a&nbsp;Moabite woman, and when that marriage did not work out,&nbsp;his mother intervened and chose a second wife for him. This&nbsp;is why the Torah had to report that his mother took a wife for&nbsp;him. His Moabite wife had lacked the Abrahamitic virtue of&nbsp;offering hospitality (even to his father).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי בעת ההיא</span><span class="font5">, “It was around that time;” the “time”&nbsp;described was when Sarah had given birth and the various&nbsp;kings in the region were now convinced and afraid that G’d&nbsp;would keep His promise to Avraham to give the entire region&nbsp;to the descendants of Avraham. As a result, Avimelech was&nbsp;prompted to seek an alliance with Avraham that would put off&nbsp;such an event for several generations, at least. He did not&nbsp;dare ask for a longer period as G’d had assured Avraham&nbsp;that the fourth generation of his descendants at the latest&nbsp;would see fulfillment of His promise. This is also why when&nbsp;the second Avimelech in Yitzchok’s time, asked for this&nbsp;alliance to be confirmed. He made no mention of a future&nbsp;generation. (Genesis 26,28)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כחסד אשר עשיתי עמך</span><span class="font5">, “corresponding to the&nbsp;kindness with which I have treated you.” Avimelech, referring&nbsp;to the present situation with Avraham as the stranger and&nbsp;himself as the owner and King of the region, asks Avraham&nbsp;to return the favour both to him and to his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אנכי אשבע</span><span class="font5">, “I am ready to swear to this.” Avraham&nbsp;does </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">acknowledge that Avimelech had done him any&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">favours, </span><span class="font5">seeing that his servants had repeatedly stolen the&nbsp;wells he had dug and he had done nothing about it</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">(Compare verse 25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,28. 'את שבע וגו</span><span class="font5">, “the seven sheep, etc;” the Hebrew word שבע, is also the basis of the Hebrew word שבועה, “oath.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי את שבע כבשות תקח מידי</span><span class="font5">, ”for the seven sheep&nbsp;accept from me;” because Avraham made this gift to&nbsp;Avimelech, G’d said to him: “because you have given him&nbsp;seven sheep, I will let your descendants wait seven&nbsp;generations during which his descendants will ruin seven&nbsp;locations in which the Jewish people will have their abode.&nbsp;They are: the Tabernacle in Gilgal, Shiloh, Nov, Giveon, and&nbsp;two permanent Temples. Furthermore the Holy Ark was&nbsp;exiled in the territory of the Philistine for a period of seven&nbsp;months during the period beginning with the death of the&nbsp;High Priest Eli. (Samuel I 6,1.) All of this is referred to in the&nbsp;Book of Psalms 38,20: ואויבי חיים עצמו; David meant to say:&nbsp;the three generations that Avraham gave away to Avimelech&nbsp;had to be paid for by his descendants with seven&nbsp;generations. There were seven generations between&nbsp;Avraham and Moses, and Pharaoh, a descendant of&nbsp;Avimelech was still alive. [The seven generations comprise&nbsp;Avraham, Yitzchok, Yaakov, Levi, Kehat, Amram, Moses.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.31. על כן קרא למקום ההוא באר שבע</span><span class="font5">, “this is why he called that place Beer Sheva.” The site had been known as&nbsp;such but now the town that would develop from that site bore&nbsp;the same name also, commencing in the time of Yitzchok. To&nbsp;the question how Avraham could possibly have made such a&nbsp;concession to Avimelech, our sages comment that we learn&nbsp;from here that one must not enter into a business partnership&nbsp;with a pagan, as eventually one will be forced to swear an&nbsp;oath involving uttering the deity believed in by one’s partner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,1. ויהי אחר הדברים האלה</span><span class="font5">, “it was after these events;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the “events” refer to the banquet&nbsp;arranged on the occasion of Yitzchok’s being weaned; Satan&nbsp;accused Avraham of not having offered a single sacrifice to&nbsp;G’d on that occasion. G’d replied that he would have been&nbsp;willing to offer even his own son as such an offering if asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the words: הדברים האלה, “these words;” Yishmael had boasted to Yitzchok that he had&nbsp;voluntarily undergone circumcision at an age when it was&nbsp;most painful, to which Ytzchok had replied that he, Yishmael,&nbsp;had endured pain only on one organ, whereas he, Yitzchok,&nbsp;would be prepared to undergo such pain on his whole body,&nbsp;i.e. he would even give his life for G’d. The reason why </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">chose the first interpretation is that the word אחר normally&nbsp;refers to an event that had immediately preceded the subject&nbsp;raised, whereas here the call for the binding of Yitzchok&nbsp;would then have occurred many years earlier. According to a&nbsp;statement by Rav Hunna in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 44,6, the word&nbsp;for “after” that the Torah should have used should then have&nbsp;been “אחרי.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third interpretation of the words: ויהי אחר הדברים האלה is that they refer to the treaty concluded between Avraham&nbsp;and Avimelech, when Avraham had voluntarily postponed the&nbsp;fulfillment of G’d’s promise to him without having first&nbsp;obtained G’d’s permission to do so. [It is a historical fact that&nbsp;sovereignty over the land of the Philistines was achieved by&nbsp;the Israelites only about 100 years prior to the destruction of&nbsp;the first Temple, (under King Yoshiyahu), over 800 years&nbsp;after Joshua conquered the rest of the Holy Land. This was&nbsp;part of the punishment for the Israelites not having carried&nbsp;out G’d’s command not to allow a single soul of the then&nbsp;residents to remain alive (if they did not emigrate).&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 20,16). [In other words, although Avraham&nbsp;was the first to cause of the fulfillment of G’d’s promise to be&nbsp;delayed, he was not the last Israelite to do so. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation, one which places the emphasis on the words נסה את אברהם, “He tested Avraham.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Avraham was not tested in order for G’d to convince </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Himself</span><span class="font5"> of his willingness to offer up his beloved son, seeing&nbsp;that such matters are known to Him, Who is omniscient; he&nbsp;was tested by the attribute of Justice which had dared&nbsp;question the degree of loyalty he could summon when so&nbsp;tested. Passing this test successfully would convince the&nbsp;people around him of the absolute obedience to any&nbsp;command G’d would issue to him. There was no way the&nbsp;nations of the world could challenge his faith thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,2. אל ארץ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">המוריה</span><span class="font5">, “to the land of Moriah;” the proper spelling should have been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">האמוריה</span><span class="font5">; it is not unusual for the&nbsp;Torah to omit the consonant </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aleph,</span><span class="font5"> when it would have been&nbsp;silent anyways, one example being Exodus 10,21 וימש חושך&nbsp;instead of .ויאמש חושך</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והעלהו שם לעולה</span><span class="font5">, “and offer him up there as burnt offering.” When Avraham is supposed to have asked G’d:&nbsp;“how can I offer a burnt offering in the absence of the priest&nbsp;whose duty it is to perform such rites? G’d answered that&nbsp;Avraham had been appointed as a priest by Him already.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 55,7) This is how the sages explained&nbsp;Psalms 110,4: נשבע ה' ולא ינחם אתה כהן לעולם על דברתי מלכי צדק,&nbsp;“The Lord has sworn and will not retract that you are a priest&nbsp;forever as per My word to Malki Tzedek.” (compare Genesis&nbsp;14,20 where the latter was deprived of that priesthood as he&nbsp;had blessed mortal Avraham before blessing the immortal&nbsp;Lord)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקח את שני נעריו</span><span class="font5">, “he took his two attendants;” here&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> does not interpret what he had explained in connection&nbsp;with a similar expression when Bileam took his two servants&nbsp;(Numbers 22,22).There he had explained that prominent&nbsp;people must always travel in the company of two attendants&nbsp;so that one of them has to follow a call of nature the&nbsp;prominent person will not have been left alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישא אברהם את עיניו</span><span class="font5">, “Avraham raised his eyes;”&nbsp;The letter ו in the word וישא is superfluous. [I confess that I&nbsp;have not understood this. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">22,5.</span><span class="font5"> !</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבו לכ</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פה, </span><span class="font5">“you stay here!;” Avraham was afraid that if he did not leave them behind they might attempt to&nbsp;stop him from slaughtering his son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ע</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">החמור</span><span class="font5">, “with the donkey;” he warned them not to let the donkey graze somewhere. [If he was afraid the servants&nbsp;might interfere with him, this was no reason to leave the&nbsp;donkey behind and carry the firewood themselves. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יראה לו השה לעולה</span><span class="font5">, “He will select the lamb that&nbsp;should be the one to serve as the burnt offering.” Even&nbsp;though G’d had told him that his descendants would become&nbsp;known through his son Yitzchok (21,12), he was afraid that&nbsp;Ytzchok would be slaughtered. He had said to himself:&nbsp;“perhaps Yitzchok has already been intimate with a woman&nbsp;without my having been aware, and that woman had already&nbsp;given birth to a son or a daughter for him, so that G’d’s&nbsp;promise will be fulfilled even if he dies here.” After all&nbsp;Yitzchok was already 37 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבן אברה</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מזבח </span><span class="font5">Avraham built an altar;” Yitzchok&nbsp;did not participate in that activity; the reason that he did not&nbsp;do so was not that he would not have been willing to do so,&nbsp;but his father had hidden him so that Satan would not be&nbsp;able to tempt him, as he had tried to tempt Avraham not to&nbsp;carry out G’d’s request by hurting him so that he would be&nbsp;unfit to serve as an offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את המזבח, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">the</span><span class="font5"> altar. The Torah did not write: “altar” without the prefix letter ה which meant that it was an altar that&nbsp;had previously served for such a purpose. According to our&nbsp;tradition, Adam, Hevel, Noach and his sons, had all offered&nbsp;offerings to G’d on that same altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אברה</span><span class="font5">ם, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אברה</span><span class="font5">ם! “Avraham, Avraham!” The&nbsp;repetition of Avraham’s name is to indicate that the call was&nbsp;of an urgent nature. This is a formulation also known in other&nbsp;languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עתה ידעתי</span><span class="font5">, “now I know for a fact, etc;” did G’d not&nbsp;already know? Actually the meaning is: “now I am able to&nbsp;make My knowledge public to all.” We have a similar&nbsp;formulation in Exodus 32,12, where G’d said to Moses: ידעתיך&nbsp;בשם, “I have made your name well known.” The appropriate&nbsp;translation would be: “I have made you so famous that no&nbsp;one can dispute it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אחר נאחז בסבך</span><span class="font5">, “subsequently he saw a ram that&nbsp;had become entangled in the thicket.” We find a similar&nbsp;construction (using the preposition אחר) in Psalms 68,26:&nbsp;קדמו שרים אחר נוגנים, “the singers preceded the musicians,” or&nbsp;in Kohelet 12,2: ושבו העבים אחר הגשם, “and the clouds return&nbsp;after the rain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Avraham saw the ram as it became entangled</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font5"> This is why he understood that it was not there&nbsp;accidentally, but that G’d had given him a hint to use it as a&nbsp;substitute for the offering he had been prevented by the&nbsp;angel to complete. If that ram had been standing there as did&nbsp;others, he would have thought it was privately owned by&nbsp;someone else and would not have touched it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: “he noticed it after it had become entangled by its horns.” (Ibn Ezra).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ה' יראה</span><span class="font5">, Avraham said the following: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hashem</span><span class="font5"> will&nbsp;become my witness after I have fulfilled this commandment&nbsp;of His.” The reason that this is necessary is some people will&nbsp;say that this is the mountain to which I brought my son in&nbsp;order to prove that I would honour Him even by offering my&nbsp;son as an offering and at which I had weakened at the last&nbsp;moment and not gone through with my intention, as proved&nbsp;by the fact that I returned with my son intact. They will not&nbsp;give me credit when told that G’d had to stop me from going&nbsp;through with slaughtering my son in His honour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,17.וכחול אשר על שפת הים</span><span class="font5">, and like the sand on the beaches of the sea. This promise became fulfilled during the&nbsp;reign of King Solomon. (Kings 5,9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,19. וישב אברהם אל נעריו</span><span class="font5">, “Avraham returned to his lads;” where did Yitzchok go? According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash hagadol,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">quoted in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> item 204 on our verse, he was&nbsp;kept in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gan eden</span><span class="font5"> for the next three years until he married&nbsp;Rivkah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: he proceeded to study Torah during those three years in the academy of Ever. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit&nbsp;Rabbah 56,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,20. ויהי אחרי הדברים האלה</span><span class="font5">, “It was after these events, etc.;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the event that had occurred on&nbsp;Mount Moriah; when returning from that experience,&nbsp;Avraham reflected and realised that if he had indeed&nbsp;slaughtered his son, how could he now get married so that&nbsp;G’d’s promised to him could be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to point out that in Genesis 15,1, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> had interpreted the line: אחר הדברים האלה, by commenting that&nbsp;wherever we find this construction in the Torah it means that&nbsp;what follows followed </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">immediately</span><span class="font5"> after the events recorded&nbsp;previously, whereas here three years elapsed until Avraham&nbsp;sent Eliezer to get his son a wife, we have to make a&nbsp;distinction between the use by the Torah of the word: אחר&nbsp;and אחרי. When the latter word is used it means that the&nbsp;events now described did not necessarily occur immediately&nbsp;following those described previously.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Chayey Sarah</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,1. ויהיו חיי שרה</span><span class="font5">, “The years of Sarah’s life amounted to etc.” People fond of dabbling in the allusions found&nbsp;through the numerical value of words or whole sentences,&nbsp;will note that the numerical value of the word ויהיו equals the&nbsp;“life of Sarah,” in other words, Sarah’s real life commenced&nbsp;with the birth of Yitzchok, at which time she was 90 years&nbsp;old, whereas she died on the day of the binding of Yitzchok&nbsp;37 years later. This is the numerical value of the word: ויהיו.&nbsp;As long as a person has no child he or she is considered as&nbsp;dead. (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nedarim,</span><span class="font5"> 64)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מאה שנה</span><span class="font5">, “one hundred years;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on the reason why the word: שנה, “year,” is repeated here three&nbsp;times, when the Torah could have simply written: מאה עשרים&nbsp;ושבע שנה, “one hundred and twenty seven years.” He&nbsp;suggests that the Torah wished us to know that Sarah was&nbsp;as free from sin at a hundred as she had been at twenty, and&nbsp;that she was as beautiful at twenty as she had been at&nbsp;seven. This, of course, raises the question why the Torah, in&nbsp;reporting the death of Yishmael at 137 years (Genesis,&nbsp;25,32) used exactly the same formulation? We can answer&nbsp;this by pointing out that when reporting Sarah’s age, each&nbsp;group of years is reported separately, as an individual unit,&nbsp;whereas when reporting Yishmael’s age at death, the groups&nbsp;of years are introduced in the construct mode, i.e. מאת, not&nbsp;מאה, i.e. all the years had the same common factor. Not only&nbsp;that, but the Torah sums up her years once more with the&nbsp;words: שני חיי שרה, “the years of Sarah’s life,” i.e. all her years&nbsp;were earmarked by a common denominator. If, when&nbsp;Avraham’s death is reported our sages have seen fit to read&nbsp;something into the way his years are reported, although&nbsp;there too just as at the death of Yishmael we find the word&nbsp;מאת in the construct form, this can be accounted for by the&nbsp;word: ימי, “days of,” which are superfluous and therefore&nbsp;available for interpretation. (Genesis 25,7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> also adds that Sarah was free from sin at twenty as if this was something exceptional; this sounds strange as&nbsp;at that time everyone was free from sin, i.e. not held&nbsp;accountable until the age of twenty? We must understand&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> as if he had written: ”just as she was free from sin at&nbsp;20, she remained free from sin until the end of her life.&nbsp;Accountability for sins at the age of 12 or 13 for females and&nbsp;males respectively, commenced only after the Torah had&nbsp;been given. [Our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">midrashim</span><span class="font5"> describe Yishmael as “innocent”&nbsp;when expelled by Sarah, as he was below 20 years of age.&nbsp;Ed.] Sarah had not required cosmetics at twenty anymore&nbsp;than she had required it at the age of seven. We know from&nbsp;Rivkah, who accepted jewelry at the age of three in order to&nbsp;enhance her appearance, that girls in thos</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font5"> days felt the&nbsp;need to enhance their natural charms at an early age.&nbsp;(Compare Genesis 24,22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pessikta zutrata</span><span class="font5"> according to which the reference to her being one hundred as meaning&nbsp;that she was as beautiful at a hundred as she had been at&nbsp;twenty, whereas she was as free from sin at twenty as she&nbsp;had been at seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שני חיי שרה</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">“the years of</span><span class="font5"> the life of Sarah.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the apparently superfluous words: “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">the years of,</span><span class="font5">”&nbsp;mean that she retained all her virtues in equal measure&nbsp;throughout her life. The wording used by the Torah when&nbsp;reporting Yishmael’s life does not lend itself to such an&nbsp;interpretation, seeing that up until his death we had never&nbsp;heard anything about his age, as distinct from Sarah. It is&nbsp;clear therefore that the words underlined earlier were meant&nbsp;to relay an additional message to the reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,2. ותמת שרה, </span><span class="font5">“Sarah died;” it is most unusual for the Torah to report the fact that a woman died. (Miriam, Moses’&nbsp;sister’s death are exceptions, Numbers 20,1 as are Rachel’s&nbsp;premature death in Genesis 35,18, and Deborah, Rivkah’s&nbsp;nursemaid in Genesis 35,8.) When such a death is reported&nbsp;it is not only a compliment to the virtuous lives these women&nbsp;had lived, but is always associated with a remarkable event.&nbsp;Sarah’s death is associated with the enormous amount of&nbsp;money paid by her husband for acquiring the land for burying&nbsp;her. Rachel’s premature death is reported so that we should&nbsp;know where she has been buried. Deborah’s death is&nbsp;reported so that we should know why the place where this&nbsp;occurred became known subsequently as אלון בכות, “oak of&nbsp;mourning.” [Also in order to draw our attention to the fact that&nbsp;her mistress, Rivkah’s death has not been reported. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Miriam’s death was the reason that the well that had accompanied the Israelites throughout their long march in the&nbsp;desert ceased flowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בקרית ארבע</span><span class="font5">, in Kiryat Arba; there is an opinion that the reason why the location where she died is mentioned, while&nbsp;the locations where the other matriarchs died were not&nbsp;mentioned is that Avraham had sent her there before taking&nbsp;Yitzchok with him to be offered as a sacrifice on Mount&nbsp;Moriah. He did not want her to have any knowledge of this.&nbsp;Avraham and Sarah at that time had been residents of B’er&nbsp;Sheva.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another commentator claims that Sarah had moved from B’er Sheva for health reasons as the climate in Chevron&nbsp;(mountainous instead of desert) was more likely to cure her.&nbsp;When she heard why Avraham had taken Yitzchok to Mount&nbsp;Moriah she died. This is why Avraham had to come all the&nbsp;way from B’er Sheva to mourn and bury her. Had she died in&nbsp;B’er Sheva, Avraham could have buried her there without&nbsp;problems as he was at home there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בקרית ארבע</span><span class="font5">, this was a town that had been built already by Adam, as we know from Joshua 14,15: קרית ארבע שם חברון&nbsp;לפנים, האדם הגדול בענקים, “the name of Chevron in former times&nbsp;was </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kiryat Arba,</span><span class="font5"> the greatest of all the giants.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different version found in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">midrashim,</span><span class="font5"> is that the name of that town is due to it changing ownership four times one&nbsp;after another. First it belonged to the tribe of Yehudah; then it&nbsp;became the private property of Calev of that tribe;&nbsp;subsequently it became a city of priests, and eventually one&nbsp;of the cities of refuge. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 58,4) This&nbsp;is why only its outskirts were given to Calev as is apparent&nbsp;from the wording in Joshua 21,12. Compare also in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba&nbsp;Batra</span><span class="font5"> 122.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבא אברהם</span><span class="font5">, “Avraham arrived.” Some scholars claim that the term: ויבא, need not imply that the subject came from&nbsp;afar, even if he only came from the outside of the house this&nbsp;term is used as we know from Joseph’s entering Potiphar’s&nbsp;house where the Torah wrote: ויבא הביתה לעשות מלאכתו, “he&nbsp;entered the house in order to perform his tasks.” (Genesis&nbsp;39,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לספוד לשרה ולבכותה</span><span class="font5">, “to eulogize Sarah and to weep over her loss.” He did so as he could not bury her until he had&nbsp;secured a suitable plot where to bury her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,4. גר ותושב אנכי עמכם</span><span class="font5">, “I am a stranger as well as a resident amongst you.” Avraham meant that on the one hand&nbsp;he was a stranger seeing that he had not been born in the&nbsp;land of the Canaanites. On the other hand, he had been like&nbsp;a resident amongst the people of Kiryat Arba. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">suggests that Avraham also implied that if he were to be&nbsp;denied his request he would insist on his legal rights in the&nbsp;matter by simply becoming a permanent resident. If you were&nbsp;to point out that according to what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> had explained on&nbsp;Genesis 13,7 where the Canaanites are described as the&nbsp;then residents of that land, that had been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> he had&nbsp;become a father of children. Such people cannot claim&nbsp;permanent resident status. After all, G’d had not promised&nbsp;Avraham that he would inherit this land. He had only&nbsp;promised it to Avraham’s descendants. Now that Yitzchok&nbsp;had been born, he was entitled to the status of a permanent&nbsp;resident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תנו לי אחוזת קבר</span><span class="font5">, “give me a burial plot that will have the status of ancestral ownership.” Avraham meant that it would&nbsp;not be satisfactory to bury Sarah in a piece of land that was&nbsp;privately owned at that time, as the present owner or his heir&nbsp;could demand at any time in the future that he transfer her&nbsp;remains to some other location. Or, worse still, he could&nbsp;simply plough over her remains. However, his mind would be&nbsp;at ease if they let him acquire a plot of land that became&nbsp;ancestrally owned and passed on from generation to&nbsp;generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,6. נשיא אלוהים</span><span class="font5">, “a prince of G’d;” they answered his first statement first when he had described his status as&nbsp;either that of a stranger or resident, by saying that he was&nbsp;much more than that. They considered him as if G’d Himself&nbsp;had sent him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As far as his second request was concerned that he needed to acquire ancestral rights to any burial plot so as to&nbsp;safeguard it to being ploughed over in the future by its&nbsp;previous owner, every one of them would be willing to deed&nbsp;to him the plot that he had already chosen for himself his&nbsp;own future burial plot. He should meanwhile proceed to bury&nbsp;his dead and they would it consider an honour to have Sarah&nbsp;buried in a plot that had once belonged to one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איש את קברו</span><span class="font5">, even if Avraham, by chance would select a plot that one of them had already earmarked as his own&nbsp;future burial ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקם אברהם</span><span class="font5">, “Avraham stood up and prostrated&nbsp;himself;” Avraham was dependent on the goodwill of&nbsp;everyone in that town; even if Efron had been willing to sell&nbsp;his field or plot Avraham would have needed the&nbsp;townspeople permission to convert it into a mausoleum.&nbsp;Knowing this, Avraham had to first arise in order to prostrate&nbsp;himself in the appropriate manner to all of them, even to the&nbsp;one sitting behind him. On the other hand, he did not need to&nbsp;do so before a single individual such as Efron; this is why the&nbsp;Torah emphasises here repeatedly that Avraham prostrated&nbsp;himself </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the common people. (verse 7 and verse 12).&nbsp;In verse 12 he prostrated himself before Efron in the&nbsp;presence of the townsfolk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ופגעו לי בעפרון</span><span class="font5">, “and entreat Efron on my behalf;” if&nbsp;you were to ask why all this was necessary after he had&nbsp;been offered the choice of many grave sites by the&nbsp;assembled people, the reason could be that Efron was&nbsp;himself not a member of the Hittites, as were the&nbsp;townspeople, so that they could not have spoken in his name&nbsp;also. He had come from afar and settled in Kiryat Arba and&nbsp;after having dwelled there they elected him as their&nbsp;president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתן לי, </span><span class="font5">“so that he will give me, etc.” Avraham&nbsp;never suggested that he wanted the cave of Machpelah as a&nbsp;gift; on the contrary, he considered that even after having&nbsp;paid a substantial amount of money for it, he would still view&nbsp;this as a gift bestowed upon him by Efron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בקצה שדהו, </span><span class="font5">“at the edge of his field;” in other words, using of that corner as a burial ground will not interfere with&nbsp;his having continued full use of his field for agricultural&nbsp;purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.10. ועפרון יושב בתוך בני חת</span><span class="font5">, “Efron was sitting among the Hittites (as if he were also a Hittite).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.11. השדה נתתי לך</span><span class="font5">, “I have given you the field;” Efron&nbsp;pointed out that unless he gave Avraham not only the cave of&nbsp;Machpelah but also his adjoining field, Avraham would have&nbsp;no access to the cave. (without asking permission to visit&nbsp;there each time). He therefore wanted to show his generosity&nbsp;to Avraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,13. נתתי כסף השדה קח ממני</span><span class="font5">, “I have already set aside the money for the field, just accept it from me.” The word:&nbsp;נתתי, really belongs to an earlier part of the dialogue which&nbsp;the Torah did not quote in full. Avraham responded to the&nbsp;“generous” offer with the question: “did I hear you right that&nbsp;you are also willing to “give” me the field?” There is no need&nbsp;for this as I have already have set aside the money for the&nbsp;field, i.e. that money is already legally yours if you fulfill the&nbsp;bargain. He made it clear that he would not accept a gift. The&nbsp;sages who were the authors of the cantillation marks already&nbsp;drew our attention to this nuance by placing the tone-sign&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gershayim,</span><span class="font5"> a disjunctive tone sign, on the word: נתתי, to&nbsp;indicate that Avraham considered this part of the transaction&nbsp;as having been completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,16. וישמע אברהם אל עפרון</span><span class="font5">, “Avraham listened to Efron (accepted his conditions), i.e. he accepted Efron’s evaluation&nbsp;of the value of the field, i.e. that to him it was worth 400&nbsp;shekel of pure silver;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישקול אברהם לעפרן</span><span class="font5">, “Avraham weighed the amount of silver;” you will note that in this verse the name “Efron” is&nbsp;spelled without the letter ו. The reason the sages spelled it&nbsp;thus is so that the numerical value of the letters in his name&nbsp;should add up to 400, i.e. the amount of silver pieces he had&nbsp;charged Avraham for burying Sarah in that cave.(Compare&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baal Haturim)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כסף עובר לסוחר</span><span class="font5">, “silver,” i.e. pure silver acceptable by any merchant. The word: עובר means “passable;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,17. ויקם</span><span class="font5">, literally: “it stood up;” the subject is the field, and the Torah means that by becoming the property of&nbsp;Avraham this field now had “risen” in spiritual value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שדה עפרון</span><span class="font5">, one side of that field extended along the whole length of that town. Here it is described in precise&nbsp;detail, i.e. ממרא היא חברון, whereas previously it had been&nbsp;described as קרית ארבע, “the city of the four;” later on during&nbsp;the lifetime of Yaakov it has been described as ממרא קרית&nbsp;הארבע היא חברון, (Genesis 35,27) a location where both&nbsp;Avraham and Yitzchok had been residents at one time or&nbsp;another. Earlier. in connection with Avraham, (12,18) he had&nbsp;been described as having settled in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kiryat Arba</span><span class="font5"> which is&nbsp;described there as “part of Chevron.” This was meant to tell&nbsp;us that Mamre was the original founder who had built himself&nbsp;a town adjacent to Chevron which had previously been&nbsp;inhabited by Hittites. He called that new town “Mamre,” thus&nbsp;memorializing himself. The “groves” of Mamre, i.e. אלוני ממרא,&nbsp;were situated at the entrance to that town. The cave of&nbsp;Machpelah, in another direction, at that time had belonged to&nbsp;the Hittites. After Mamre’s death, a giant by the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Arba</span><span class="font5"> became very powerful and claimed the entire area,&nbsp;naming it </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Arba</span><span class="font5"> after himself. Several centuries later, when&nbsp;the Israelites had defeated most of Canaanite tribes they&nbsp;called that town </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chevron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל מערת המכפלה</span><span class="font5">, “literally: “to” the cave of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Machpelah;</span><span class="font5"> actually the word: אל here appears in lieu of the&nbsp;prefix ב. We find similar instances of the word אל being used&nbsp;in lieu of the prefix ב, in Exodus 25,16, and Numbers 19,6, as&nbsp;well as in Numbers 19,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.20. ויקם השדה</span><span class="font5">, “this formulation uses the verb קום in the sense of being stable, remaining firmly established.&nbsp;Examples are Numbers 30,10 where it refers to the validity&nbsp;until honoured, of a vow made by a woman of age and not&nbsp;married. In this instance, the Torah records that the transfer&nbsp;of the cave and field adjoining Machpelah from Efron to&nbsp;Avraham remains valid forever unless Avraham’s&nbsp;descendants relinquish their claim to it freely and not under&nbsp;any duress. Avraham himself, of course, also acquired the&nbsp;legal right to be buried alongside his beloved wife Sarah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מאת בני חת </span><span class="font5">“from the Hittites.” Avraham had taken the town seal and attached it to the document registering this&nbsp;sale. He did so in order to prevent the townspeople claiming&nbsp;in the future that Efron had not had the legal right to sell the&nbsp;property in question. [It occurs to this editor that if Yaakov,&nbsp;Avraham’s grandson, had not relied on Lavan’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">word</span><span class="font5"> when&nbsp;he agreed to work seven years for the hand of Rachel in&nbsp;marriage, but had insisted on a written document, he might&nbsp;have saved himself an untold amount of grief.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואברהם זקן</span><span class="font5">, “and by now Avraham had visibly&nbsp;aged;” he could no longer move around easily, and that is&nbsp;why he sent his servant to select a bride for Yitzchok.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זקן ביתו</span><span class="font5">, “the senior servant of his household;”&nbsp;Eliezer was old enough so that Avraham did not have to&nbsp;worry that he would take advantage of his position to indulge&nbsp;in incestuous conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תחת ירכי</span><span class="font5">, according to the plain meaning of the word it has nothing to do with the place where Avraham had&nbsp;circumcised himself, although it was the most sacred symbol&nbsp;of his body. If it had, why did Avraham not make him swear&nbsp;an oath by using it as the focus instead of using </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> as&nbsp;his focus? It simply was the custom in those days that any&nbsp;person who was subservient to another person would place&nbsp;his had under the thigh of his master as a symbol that he&nbsp;acknowledged him as such. Having done this was equivalent&nbsp;to a promise to carry out his master’s wishes. This custom&nbsp;was still in use in India in our author’s time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מבנות הכנעני</span><span class="font5">, “from among the daughters of the&nbsp;Canaanite nation.” Avraham did not want that in the future&nbsp;anyone could claim that his claim on the Holy Land was&nbsp;based on intermarriage with the previous owners of that land.&nbsp;It had to be established beyond any shadow of a doubt that&nbsp;the Israelites’ claim to the land was based on G’d having&nbsp;promised it to their founding father, and that He used </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">His&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Power to do this on their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,4. אל ארצי</span><span class="font5">, “to my homeland;” i.e. to Charan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואל מולדתי</span><span class="font5">, “to my birthplace;” i.e. Ur Casdim. Avraham told Eliezer that he did not want any gentile woman to have a&nbsp;share in his ancestral portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,5. ההשיב אשיב את בנך, </span><span class="font5">“shall I really take back your son there? This is a peculiar question by Eliezer, as Yitzchok&nbsp;had never been out of the land of Canaan. Seeing that&nbsp;Eliezer had been sent back there on behalf of Yitzchok, his&nbsp;question was perfectly in order. We find a similar verse in&nbsp;Ruth 1,22 where Naomi is described as “returning” to the&nbsp;land of Israel with her daughter-in-law, although the daughter&nbsp;-in-law, Ruth, had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span><span class="font5"> set foot in that land. As far as Ruth&nbsp;was concerned that journey was even more of a “return,” a&nbsp;180 degree turn around in her life, than it was for her mother-in-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,7. ה' אלוקי השמים</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord, the G’d of heaven;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that Avraham did not add that this “G’d”&nbsp;was also the “G’d” of the earth. The reason was that the time&nbsp;frame Avraham spoke about was before he had preached&nbsp;monotheism to his peers, none of whom had until then&nbsp;recognised Him as their G’d. If that approach to G’d’s stature&nbsp;were correct, we would have to ask how G’d could have&nbsp;been referred to as the G’d of heaven in Genesis 1,1, when,&nbsp;according to tradition the heaven as we understand it was&nbsp;created only on the second day of the six days of creation?&nbsp;[In our daily prayers, אדון עולם, we commence by stating that&nbsp;that the Master of the universe was “king” before any&nbsp;creature had been created? In other words, the title “King” is&nbsp;not dependent on this King already having subjects over&nbsp;whom to rule. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same point has been made by Isaiah 43,10: “before Me no god was formed and after Me none shall&nbsp;exist.” The point that the prophet makes is that G’d’s&nbsp;existence is dependent on His having loyal subjects. Only He&nbsp;is eternal. This is also the reason why the first blessing in our&nbsp;thrice daily </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">amidah,</span><span class="font5"> שמונה עשרה, does not contain a reference&nbsp;to G’d as “king,” as do other blessings. It would be&nbsp;inappropriate to commence with the sequence: מלך העולם&nbsp;אלוקי אברהם וגו', “the King of the universe, the G’d of&nbsp;Avraham, etc.” seeing that in the chapter of the Torah where</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Avraham is introduced He could not truthfully have been described as the “King” of the whole universe. When&nbsp;Avraham in our verse credited G’d with having taken him out&nbsp;of his father’s house, etc., he thereby “crowned” G’d as “king”&nbsp;also on earth, he being His first subject. Nonetheless this&nbsp;was a far cry from being recognised as king of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר לקחני מבית אבי</span><span class="font5">, “Who has taken me out of my father’s house;” He removed me from my relatives in order to&nbsp;give me thjs land, and He certainly would not want me to&nbsp;return my descendants to the land which He had taken me&nbsp;out of. This is why I am so certain that He will send His angel&nbsp;before you to make your mission successful. Why else would&nbsp;He have brought me to this country, if not in order to be able&nbsp;to fulfill His promise to me?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולקחת אשה לבני</span><span class="font5">, “you will take a wife for my son.” This is not a commandment or a prayer, but a prophecy. We find&nbsp;confirmation for this interpretation in the words: 'כאשר דבר ה&nbsp;“as the Lord has said,” in verse 51 of this chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;רק את בני</span><span class="font5">, “only my son etc.;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the restriction applied only to Avraham’s son Yitzchok, as he&nbsp;had been a total offering on G’d’s altar on the Holy Mountain&nbsp;of Moriah. It had therefore stopped being appropriate for him&nbsp;to leave the Holy Land for any purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תשב שמה</span><span class="font5">, “do not cause to go back there.” Avraham says that he does not want his son to leave the ancestral&nbsp;earth G’d had promised him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.9. תחת ירך אברהם</span><span class="font5">, “under the thigh of Avraham.” Joseph, when asked by his father to swear that he would not&nbsp;bury him in Egypt but with his father and grandfather in&nbsp;Machpelah, did not do so, as he considered it in bad taste to&nbsp;do so to his father, even though his father had requested it.&nbsp;(Compare Genesis 47,29-31)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.10. - ויקח העבד, </span><span class="font5">“the servant took, etc;” Eliezer was&nbsp;able to do so, as the Torah tells us that Avraham had&nbsp;entrusted all his most treasured possessions to his care, וכל&nbsp;.טוב אדוניו בידו</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עשרה גמלים, </span><span class="font5">“ten camels” to be ridden by ten men who would form the necessary quorum at the engagement and&nbsp;(marriage ceremony). [The bracket is to tell the reader that&nbsp;different manuscripts either have or do not have that word.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מגמלי אדוניו, </span><span class="font5">“from the camels owned by his master;” from the choicest, raised in his own home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל טוב אדוניו בידו</span><span class="font5">, “there are opinions according to whom the letter מ as a prefix to the word מגמלי should be placed in&nbsp;front of the letter כ in the word: וכל, so that that word is read&nbsp;as ומכל, “and samples of all,“ etc. These “samples” are what&nbsp;the Torah speaks about in reporting Eliezer as sharing out all&nbsp;kinds of goodies in verse 53 of our chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,11. ויברך הגמלים</span><span class="font5">, “he made the camels kneel down.” Camels have two sets of knees. They therefore have to&nbsp;perform two acts of kneeling, before being able to drink. We&nbsp;have learned more details in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> 76.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הנה אנכי נצב</span><span class="font5">, “I am standing;” Eliezer meant that&nbsp;he had come to a critical juncture in his journey, and had to&nbsp;make some decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על עין המים, </span><span class="font5">“at the town’s water fountain.” This is where I can test a potentially eligible girl on her suitability as&nbsp;Yitzchok’s wife to be. When such a girl is away from her&nbsp;home, whatever she decides to do has not been what she&nbsp;had been told to do by her mother or father, but reflects her&nbsp;true personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיה הנערה, </span><span class="font5">Eliezer now refers to how he will test&nbsp;a girl who at first glance appears to him as a suitable&nbsp;prospect, -seeing that he cannot ask all the girls to draw&nbsp;water his camels etc;- the use by Eliezer of the masculine&nbsp;mode in connection with the word בתולה, is most puzzling.&nbsp;The word therefore must not be understood as referring to&nbsp;the girl’s virginity, something Eliezer could not examine,&nbsp;certainly not at this juncture, but it must refer to some word or&nbsp;subject the Torah has omitted. This is not as unusual as it&nbsp;sounds, as we have another example of something like this&nbsp;in Deuteronomy 22,23: כי יהיה נער בתולה מאורשה לאיש, “when&nbsp;there will be a young girl who is a virgin betrothed to a man,&nbsp;etc;” in that line also the word יהיה, which is in the masculine&nbsp;mode, cannot refer to the girl in question but to the subject&nbsp;matter, just as in our verse here, Eliezer addresses a subject&nbsp;matter he has not spelled out as such, his examination of the&nbsp;girl’s character’s suitability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואמרה שתה</span><span class="font5">, and she says: “go ahead and drink!” Eliezer is not engaging in ניחוש, divination, but he was looking for an&nbsp;omen, something permitted by Jewish law. He did not rely on&nbsp;this as a reason to give Rivkah the jewelry as he had first&nbsp;enquired about her immediate family history and it had&nbsp;turned out that she was a member of Avraham’s family. He&nbsp;had only made the jewelry ready in the event that it turned&nbsp;out that the girl offering him water to drink should turn out to&nbsp;be a member of Avraham’s family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,16. בתולה</span><span class="font5">, “a virgin;” according to the view that Rivkah was only three years old, the Torah hardly needed to&nbsp;add this detail; the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Niddah</span><span class="font5"> 44, explains this by&nbsp;saying that even if she had been violated by someone, her&nbsp;hymen had grown together again, (something that was&nbsp;known to people in those days).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותער כדה אל השוקת</span><span class="font5">, “she poured the water in her&nbsp;jug into the trough (for the animals).” She observed the rule&nbsp;of not wasting water by pouring surplus water that Eliezer&nbsp;had not drunk into the trough meant for the camels to drink&nbsp;from, instead of pouring it on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;משתאה לה</span><span class="font5">, although literally “at her,” the word לה&nbsp;here is to be understood as if the Torah had written: עליה,&nbsp;“about her.” We find a similar formulation in Numbers 23,23:&nbsp;כעת יאמר ליעקב ולישראל, “at that time it is reported about Israel,&nbsp;etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,22. </span><span class="font5">ויקח האיש, literally: “the man took;” the reason&nbsp;why the Torah did not write simply: “the man gave, etc,” is&nbsp;that he searched among the jewelry he had with him the kind&nbsp;which was the appropriate size for someone her age. He&nbsp;would give it to her in the event she met the conditions&nbsp;Eliezer had made as the Torah had previously outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בקע משקלו</span><span class="font5">, the word בקע means “split,” as we know from Exodus 14,16 ובקעהו, “and he split it;” (the waters of the sea&nbsp;of reeds) a half shekel each (for each arm).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמר, בת מי את</span><span class="font5">, he said: “whose daughter are you?” He had asked this question before giving her anything, as is&nbsp;clear from when he repeats what took place before sharing&nbsp;any food with her family in verse 47 of this chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the line: “the man took out a golden nose-ring,” is to be understood literally; he did&nbsp;something completely appropriate as a reward for the girl’s&nbsp;having let him and his camels to drink, a task which had&nbsp;consumed time and effort. He also meant to show that he&nbsp;was a servant of a wealthy man. When telling her family at&nbsp;the dinner table what had transpired at the well, he added&nbsp;that he had first enquired from her about her family status; he&nbsp;did so in order to flatter the family, suggesting that he would&nbsp;not have given her such gifts before knowing that she was a&nbsp;member of Avraham’s family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">נזם זהב, the translation of this word by the Targum here is different from the same word in Exodus 35,22. This word&nbsp;sometimes means a ring worn in the ear, other times a ring&nbsp;worn in the nose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושני צמידים על ידיה</span><span class="font5">, “and two bracelets on her hands.” The word: שם , “he placed,” has been omitted in this verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,26. ללין</span><span class="font5">, this is a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">noun</span><span class="font5"> meaning: “a place that serves as shelter for the night.” He asked whether there was nearby&nbsp;an inn for travelers. (He did not ask for accommodation for&nbsp;his ten men and camels as a favour). The formulation ללין is&nbsp;parallel to the formulation לדין, and the noun ריב “quarrel,”&nbsp;from the root רוב, “to fight.” When used as a verb we find the&nbsp;formulation: וילן, “he stayed overnight.”</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.24. בת בתואל אנכי בן מלכה אשר ילדה לנחור</span><span class="font5">, “I am a</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">daughter of Betuel, who is a son of Milkah whom the latter bore for Nachor (Avraham’s brother). The reason she gave&nbsp;him all these details was that she did not want Eliezer to&nbsp;think that Betuel had been born by a concubine, but that he&nbsp;was the son of Milkah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גם תבן גם מספוא רב עמנו</span><span class="font5">, “we also have plenty of&nbsp;straw and fodder.” She volunteered additional information&nbsp;that Eliezer had not enquired about, so as to indicate that his&nbsp;entourage would also be welcome as guests in her father’s&nbsp;house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ללון</span><span class="font5">, “for you all as well as your beasts to spend the night.” The formulation is parallel to: לדון, to judge, or לשוב, to&nbsp;come back. She implied that there was no inn for travelers&nbsp;nearby but that there was no need for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,27. 'ברוך ה</span><span class="font5">, “blessed be the Lord, etc.;” wherever we encounter the formula: 'ברוך ה in connection with G’d, be it in&nbsp;the Holy Scriptures, the oral Torah, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah,</span><span class="font5"> or in our&nbsp;prayers, or in connection with nature’s products, it is to be&nbsp;understood as either a greeting or praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ברוך </span><span class="font5">ה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">according to our sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit&nbsp;Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 60,7, Eliezer thanked the Lord, who had removed&nbsp;the curse that had lain on him together with all the&nbsp;descendants of Canaan. He no longer suffered from that taint&nbsp;as he had faithfully carried out the mission his master had&nbsp;assigned to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לרחוץ רגליו ורגלי האנשים</span><span class="font5">, “to wash his feet as well&nbsp;as the feet of the men accompanying him;” even though&nbsp;Rivkah’s brother was an idolater he knew about the customs&nbsp;in Avraham’s house. When he said that he had “cleaned the&nbsp;house already,” he referred to the removal of idolatrous&nbsp;images. At any rate, he respected other people’s religious&nbsp;convictions and did not wish to offend their sensitivities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויישם</span><span class="font5">, “it was placed before him;” although this&nbsp;word is spelled here with two letters י, it is meant to be read&nbsp;and understood as if it had been written: ויושם. (Compare&nbsp;also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,35. ועבדם</span><span class="font5">, “and men-servants.” The letter י indicating the plural mode before the final letter ם is missing here; it&nbsp;suggests that Avraham had only a single man-servant, i.e.&nbsp;himself. Eliezer performed so many tasks for Avraham that it&nbsp;seemed as if he had numerous men-servants [If so, it is not&nbsp;clear who the ten men were who had accompanied Eliezer.&nbsp;Ed.] Perhaps those other assistants, especially the 318 men&nbsp;who accompanied him went he went to liberate Lot from&nbsp;captivity. (Genesis 14,14) Perhaps he gave them their&nbsp;freedom after they had become circumcised? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,36. אחרי זקנתה</span><span class="font5">, “after she had become old;” so that he could not expect to have any more sons from her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,39. אלי</span><span class="font5">, “perhaps;” the word is spelled defective with the letter ו missing after the first letter. It suggests that Eliezer&nbsp;was using a certain amount of flattery for his hosts, indicating&nbsp;that if he had wanted to he could have prevented this union&nbsp;and his master might have chosen his own daughter as his&nbsp;daughter-in-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.42. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5">when I arrived today;” on these words </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">comments that Eliezer’s story has been repeated twice,&nbsp;whereas many other stories have not even been spelled out&nbsp;completely once but have only been hinted at. It is the&nbsp;Torah’s compliment for Eliezer by G’d Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning the reason for the repetition is that the Torah wished to describe Eliezer’s oath&nbsp;to Avraham as one part of the story and his prayer to G’d to&nbsp;help him find a girl such as Rivkah as his own initiative, for&nbsp;how else would he meet a blood relation of his master as the&nbsp;very first girl that came out to draw water. His hosts were&nbsp;suitably impressed, so that they agreed that this match must&nbsp;reflect the will of G’d. (verse 50)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.43. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיה העלמה</span><span class="font5">, earlier (in verse 16) Eliezer had&nbsp;referred to the as yet unknown to him girl as הנער. He had&nbsp;thought previously that the inhabitants of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aram Naharayim&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">only spoke and understood the local language, Aramaic.&nbsp;However, it turned out that they also understood Hebrew, as&nbsp;we know from when they said: תשב הנערה, “let the girl remain&nbsp;for a while.” (verse 55)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,48. את בת אחי אדוני לבנו</span><span class="font5">, “the daughter of my master’s brother for his son”. In verse 27 Eliezer had referred to the&nbsp;family of Betuel as “the house of my master’s&nbsp;brothers,”(plural) whereas here he speaks of my master’s&nbsp;brother (singular mode. Why the sudden change? It was a&nbsp;hint that he was to take only one of his master’s relatives as&nbsp;a bride for Yitzchok.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,53 ויוצא העבד כלי כסף</span><span class="font5">, “the servant brought out silver trinkets, etc.” The trinkets mentioned here were intended as&nbsp;gifts accompanying the betrothal, whereas the ones&nbsp;mentioned earlier were gifts for his hosts. Betrothal is viewed&nbsp;as the first step of the wedding. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Kidushin</span><span class="font5"> 50)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning of the verse, Eliezer gave the valuable gifts to Rivkah, seeing that he was certain&nbsp;she would take them with her to her new home, whereas he&nbsp;gave relatively inexpensive gifts to various members of her&nbsp;family. Rivkah’s father, Betuel, did not require to be “bribed”&nbsp;by gifts; he was happy that his daughter had been chosen to&nbsp;become the wife of Yitzchok, his cousin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is reflected in the text when the Torah wrote: “ ויאמר אחיה ואמה וגו', “her brother and her mother said, etc.; (used&nbsp;delaying tactics) Betuel was not in favour of any delay, as he&nbsp;was overjoyed that she married within the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning of the text, he allowed his son and wife to speak first, seeing that they had been the&nbsp;recipients of gifts, or because in that household it was Lavan&nbsp;who was the “senior” voice seeing that he was very astute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have read in an aggadic text that Betuel tried to poison Eliezer’s food in order to prevent the marriage and&nbsp;that due to an angel’s switching plates he ate the poisoned&nbsp;food himself and died. This is supposedly why his name no&nbsp;longer appears in the rest of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third version. The reason that Betuel, בתואל, was known by that name was that seeing that he was the nominal&nbsp;chief in Aram, he had reserved the right for himself to sleep&nbsp;with every virgin before she became married. His peers&nbsp;therefore demanded that he also sleep with Rivkah before&nbsp;she became married, otherwise they threatened to kill him.&nbsp;He agreed, and that it why the angel Gavriel killed him before&nbsp;he could carry out his intention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,55. תשב הנערה אתנו, </span><span class="font5">“let the girl stay with us, etc.;” if you were to ask how they could have asked for a delay after&nbsp;having already agreed to the match and having declared the&nbsp;match as having been made in heaven? They had even said:&nbsp;“take Rivkah and be on your way!” (verse 51)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning they had thought that Eliezer had been authorized only to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">arrange </span><span class="font5">for the betrothal which would take&nbsp;place in Yitzchok’s hometown. The matter therefore had&nbsp;appeared as very urgent. Now that they saw that Eliezer had&nbsp;already </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">performed</span><span class="font5"> (through the gifts) the rites of betrothal,&nbsp;they no longer saw any reason for the hurry. They therefore&nbsp;asked that an engaged girl be given the customary 12&nbsp;months to prepare herself for her nuptials. (Compare&nbsp;Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ketuvot</span><span class="font5"> 57)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">י</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מים או עשור</span><span class="font5">, the word: ימים does not refer to a few days, but to the days making up 12 months, i.e. a year. (Compare&nbsp;Esther 2,12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,59. ואת מנקתה</span><span class="font5">, “and her nursemaid.” She was used to her as she was still so young. The reason that the Torah&nbsp;mentions this is that otherwise we would not have&nbsp;understood why her death, while Yaakov was on the way&nbsp;back to the land of Canaan, had been mentioned [on that&nbsp;occasion with her name. (Genesis 35,8) Ed.])</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.62. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בא מבא באר לחי רואי, </span><span class="font5">“he had returned from visiting&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b’eer-la-chay ro-i;”</span><span class="font5"> he did not literally return from that well&nbsp;but from the region’s outer boundary. The formulation in our&nbsp;verse is similar to Kings I 8,65: מלבא חמת, or from Genesis&nbsp;25,18: בואכה אשורה, “all the way to Ashur.” It is as if the Torah&nbsp;had written: מן בא. The word בא is used here in the same&nbsp;sense as in Judges 1,24: הראנו נא את מבא כניסת העיר</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">please&nbsp;show us the way to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">entrance</span><span class="font5"> of the city.” The letter מ in&nbsp;the word: מבא is to be understood like the letter מ in Psalms&nbsp;38,5: מתום which means תום, from תמים, pure, unadulterated,&nbsp;(in the spiritual sense.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.63. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויצא יצחק</span><span class="font5">, “Yitzchok went forth;” (he left his&nbsp;house) seeing that the Torah does not specify from where&nbsp;“Yitzchok went out,” our sages have understood it to mean&nbsp;that he left </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gan Eden,</span><span class="font5"> where he had spent the last three&nbsp;years after undergoing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">akeydah</span><span class="font5"> on Mount Moriah.&nbsp;(Compare our comments page 164 on Genesis 22,19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לשוח בשדה</span><span class="font5">, “to the shrubs in the field.” The word is familiar to us from Genesis 2,5: שיח השדה, “vegetation of the&nbsp;field,” it is also familiar to us from Genesis 21,15: תחת אחת&nbsp;השיחים, “under one of the bushes” where Hagar abandoned&nbsp;her son Yishmael who was about to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: it is related to the word: שיחה, “conversation;” it then means that Yitzchok went into the field&nbsp;to converse with G’d (pray).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,64. ותרא את יצחק ותפול מעל הגמל, </span><span class="font5">“when she saw Yitzchok she fell from the camel.” When she had her first&nbsp;glance of a handsome tall man walking across a field that&nbsp;had not been trampled by previous pedestrians crossing it,&nbsp;she, a mere three year old, became frightened and anxious&nbsp;that she would not become the victim of a rapist. She fell&nbsp;from fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis of this line: the sequence here has been distorted. After seeing a figure approaching, she asked&nbsp;about the identity of that person. When told by Eliezer that&nbsp;“this is my master,” (actually his master’s son) she hastily&nbsp;descended from the camel and covered her face with a veil,&nbsp;as a sign of her chastity. Her descent from the camel was&nbsp;totally voluntary, just as when someone prostrates himself in&nbsp;prayer, it is described as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויפול </span><span class="font5">על פניו, meaning: “he&nbsp;deliberately bowed his face to the ground.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,67. ויביאה האהלה שרה אמו, </span><span class="font5">“he brought her to the tent of Sarah, his mother” Every word which normally requires the&nbsp;letter ל as a prefix, can instead be spelled with the letter ה as&nbsp;suffix. In other words: the word האהלה in our verse means: “to&nbsp;her tent, i.e. the tent that used to be Sarah’s tent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שרה אמו</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> -presumably because we all know that Sarah had been Yitzchok’s mother- explains here that as&nbsp;long as Sarah had been alive, a light was burning in her tent&nbsp;on a 24/7 basis, and her doughs were always blessed, and a&nbsp;cloud was overhead at the entrance to her tent. These&nbsp;phenomena had stopped with her death. As soon as Rivkah&nbsp;entered the tent the light began to burn again. This was&nbsp;taken by Yitzchok as a sign that Rivkah would replace the&nbsp;mother had held dear in his heart as long as she had been&nbsp;alive. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> source is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 60,16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וינחם יצחק אחרי אמו</span><span class="font5">, Now Yitzchok became comforted, (came to terms with) the death of his mother when he saw&nbsp;that his wife possessed the virtues his mother had been&nbsp;famous for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,1. ויוסף אברהם ויקח אשה</span><span class="font5">, “Avraham continued life as usual by taking a wife;” this is a reference to Hagar who now&nbsp;had a another name, Keturah. We find a similar formulation&nbsp;to the above in Isaiah 8,5: ויוסף ה' דבר אלי עוד, “the Lord&nbsp;continued by speaking to me again;” the Torah wished to&nbsp;teach us civilised norms by reporting this, i.e. that when&nbsp;widower’s sons have grown up but have not married yet, he&nbsp;should wait with remarrying until his children are married.&nbsp;(According to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">matnot kehunah</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Breshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">the&nbsp;apparently superfluous word ויוסף, “he continued,” is to teach&nbsp;us that it was the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> woman to whom he had been&nbsp;married once before, i.e. Hagar.) In order to make the point&nbsp;that a widower under the right conditions is to marry again is&nbsp;why the above line has been written immediately after the&nbsp;Torah had reported the marriage of Yitzchok to Rivkah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמה קטורה</span><span class="font5">, “whose name was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Keturah; Rashi </span><span class="font5">comments on this that her name now was קטורה as her good&nbsp;deeds were comparable to the incense, קטורת later on offered&nbsp;twice daily in the Holy Temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To your question that this appears to contradict what we have read in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">own commentary on Genesis 21,14 ותלך&nbsp;ותתע, that Hagar had returned to the idolatrous practices she&nbsp;had learned in her father’s house, you will have to say that in&nbsp;the many years since then (over 40 years) she had become&nbsp;a penitent, and on account of that her name had been&nbsp;changed by the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning of the text, Keturah is not identical with Hagar. (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,3. אשורים</span><span class="font5">, the name given to tent-dwelling nomads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לטושים</span><span class="font5">, people who live scattered, and do not form a cohesive civilisation. The meaning is similar to the word&nbsp;נטושים people who have been abandoned on the fields, the&nbsp;letter נ having been exchanged by the letter ל.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,6. ולבני הפילגשים</span><span class="font5">, “and to the sons of the concubines;” according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">this word has been spelled defectively,&nbsp;the letter י before the final letter ם which would indicate the&nbsp;plural mode, being absent, in order to teach us that there&nbsp;was only one concubine. [The fact is that in our Torah scrolls&nbsp;nowadays that letter is not missing. Concubines did not enjoy&nbsp;the financial protection offered by a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ketuvah.</span><span class="font5"> Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">נתן אברהם מתנות, “Avraham gave substantial gifts;” [in lieu of a share in his estate. Ed.] Our sages (in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin 91&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">understand the word מתנות as referring to the names of&nbsp;different types of pagan deities, i.e. he taught them how to&nbsp;protect themselves against curses uttered in the name of&nbsp;such “deities.” Our author, quoting another source believes&nbsp;that we must understand this as what is taught in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">65, הלן בבית הקברות כדי שתשרה עליו רוח טומאה, “if someone&nbsp;spends the night in a cemetery in order to endear himself to&nbsp;the demon whose domain this is, he is guilty of violating the&nbsp;commandment no to seek advice from the dead.”&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 18,1) The fact that the word מתנות is spelled&nbsp;defectively, (without the letter ו before the final letter) lends&nbsp;support to this interpretation, as the way it is written the&nbsp;numerical value of the word 890) מתנת) is equal to the&nbsp;numerical value of the combined words למדם להשביע השדים,&nbsp;“he taught them how to swear by the demons in order to&nbsp;neutralise their power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[According to this editor’s arithmetic the numerical value of למדם להשביע השדים totals only 854. The whole subject&nbsp;is wrapped in mystery.

Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישלחם מעל יצחק בנו בעודנו חי</span><span class="font5">, “he sent them far away from his son Yitzchok while he was still alive. He wanted to&nbsp;prevent them from staking a claim to part of Yitzchok’s&nbsp;inheritance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל ארץ קדם</span><span class="font5">, to a country further east to which had ancestral claims dating back to his father Terach. The region&nbsp;of Aram is east of the land of Canaan. These were the “gifts”&nbsp;he bestowed upon the sons of the concubine(s). (Compare&nbsp;Isaiah 9,11) We have also read in Genesis 22,21 about Utz&nbsp;being one of the sons of Milkah; Job is also known to have&nbsp;originated in the land of Utz, presumably the same land&nbsp;inhabited by Nachor, Avraham’s brother. Job is described&nbsp;there as the most outstanding personality in the whole ארץ&nbsp;קדם, the land given (in part) to the sons of Avraham’s&nbsp;concubine(s). We are entitled therefore to consider the land&nbsp;of Utz as identical with the region of Aram.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויגוע</span><span class="font5">, “he expired; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> this</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">expression denoting someone’s passing is reserved for use with the righteous. [This </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> is not found in our editions of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> at this point at all. Ed.] This raises the question of why&nbsp;this term has been applied to the death of almost all of&nbsp;mankind during the deluge, the people who had perished&nbsp;there having been clearly described as everything but&nbsp;“righteous.” (Compare Genesis 7,21) [There the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> is not&nbsp;found either. Ed.] The answer is that what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> meant was&nbsp;the combination of the term גויעה and אסיפה,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“i.e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">simultaneous death and transfer of the soul to the domain where the ancestors enjoy the benign radiance of G’d’s&nbsp;spirit.” [afterlife, in plain English.] Even though the&nbsp;combination of these two terms also occurs where the Torah&nbsp;records the death of Yishmael (25,17), our sages see in this&nbsp;proof that the latter had become a penitent prior to his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יצחק וישמעאל </span><span class="font5">, “both Yitzchok and Yishmael;” even&nbsp;though Yishmael was the senior son of Avraham, in fact his&nbsp;firstborn, Yitzchok is mentioned first as he was born by&nbsp;Avraham’s principal wife. Yishmael, after all was the son of a&nbsp;slave-woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,11. ויהי אחרי מות אברהם</span><span class="font5">, “it came to pass after the death of Avraham that G’d blessed Yitzchok.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains&nbsp;that although G’d had bestowed the power to bestow&nbsp;blessings on Avraham, in fact had given him a free hand on&nbsp;whom to bestow his blessing, he had not made use of the&nbsp;power to bless Yitzchok. Rabbi Nechemyah claims that&nbsp;although Avraham had passed on that power to distribute&nbsp;blessings to Yitzchok, he himself had not conferred a&nbsp;blessing on his son, so that G’d had now made up for this&nbsp;omission on the part of Avraham. (According to some&nbsp;sources he had not done so as he foresaw the birth of Esau;&nbsp;according to others, he did not want to provoke the anger of&nbsp;Yishmael his first born.)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Toldot</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואלה תולדות יצחק</span><span class="font5">, “and these were the&nbsp;descendants of Yitzchok;” previously the Torah had listed the&nbsp;descendants of Yishmael </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> the descendants of Keturah;&nbsp;now the Torah goes into details of Yitzchok’s descendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אברהם הוליד את יצחק</span><span class="font5">, “Avraham sired Yitzchok.” The Torah appears to repeat itself here because it did not refer&nbsp;again to Yitzchok’s mother as opposed to 25,12 where it&nbsp;stressed that Yishmael’s mother was Hagar, stressing that&nbsp;she was of Egyptian origin. Were it not for this detail, I might&nbsp;have said that the reason why the Torah repeated the line&nbsp;that Avraham was Yitzchok’s father was another way of&nbsp;saying that Yitzchok was raised in his father’s house, similar&nbsp;to Moses, of whom the Torah reported that as soon as&nbsp;Pharaoh’s daughter had brought him to Pharaoh’s palace he&nbsp;was raised as if he had been her son. (Exodus 2,10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The repetition is meant to stress that of all the eight sons that Avraham fathered, Yitzchok was by far the most&nbsp;important one (for the Jewish people)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: Yitzchok’s father was not </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avram</span><span class="font5"> but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avraham.</span><span class="font5"> As long as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avram’s</span><span class="font5"> name had not been&nbsp;changed he had not been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">able</span><span class="font5"> to sire Yitzchok.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third explanation: if you were to ask why the Torah repeated this information, as if </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avraham</span><span class="font5"> had numerous sons&nbsp;called Yitzchok, when in fact he had only one by that name?&nbsp;The Torah wished to stress that ultimately Avraham’s&nbsp;historical stature was assured </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> by his son Yitzchok. The&nbsp;Torah hints at a famous line by King Solomon in Proverbs&nbsp;17,6: עטרת זקנים בני בנים, “the crown of the elders are their&nbsp;grandchildren, but the glory of their children are their&nbsp;parents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.20</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ויהי יצחק בן ארבעים שנה</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> comment on this apparently historically irrelevant detail, is that the Torah&nbsp;informed us that Yitzchok, after marrying Rivkah, waited for&nbsp;three years until she was old enough to engage in&nbsp;intercourse and become pregnant. (14 years old) [In his&nbsp;commentary on Genesis 24,16, item 91 Rabbi Kasher in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah Shleymah,</span><span class="font5"> deals at length with the conflicting opinions&nbsp;about Rivkah’s age at marriage. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> on Deuteronomy 34,7&nbsp;claims that Rivkah lived to the age of 133 years, same age&nbsp;as that of Kehat, son of Levi. Our author calculates that if&nbsp;Rivkah had only been 3 years at the time when she was&nbsp;married that calculation would be wrong by eleven years. He&nbsp;proceeds to give details tracing the various ages of our&nbsp;patriarchs and matriarchs down to the birth of Kehat. He also&nbsp;understands the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> according to which Avraham heard&nbsp;about the fact that Betuel had fathered Rivkah as not&nbsp;meaning that this had occurred at the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> time as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">akeydah,</span><span class="font5"> but that Avraham had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">belatedly</span><span class="font5"> heard about this.&nbsp;As proof that Rivkah could not have been only 3 years old&nbsp;when Eliezrer met her, he cites the fact that her brother and&nbsp;mother refer to her as a נערה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">a term never applied to&nbsp;someone younger than 12-12 and a half years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The well known traditional historic text known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seder olam</span><span class="font5"> in its first chapter, also writes that when Avraham&nbsp;returned from the Akeydah he was told that Rivkah had been&nbsp;born. The meaning of that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> was that she had been&nbsp;born some time ago. Another proof that she was of age is&nbsp;that we have an iron clad rule that parents must not marry off&nbsp;a girl who has already reached puberty unless she has been&nbsp;asked and given her consent. The fact that in our chapter&nbsp;Rivkah’s family proceeds to ask for her consent proves that&nbsp;without it the parents could not have married her off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מפדן ארם</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this is identical with the region elsewhere described as שדה ארם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">(Hoseah 12,13 also&nbsp;sometimes described as שדה פדן. In Arabic it appears as פדן&nbsp;שדה. Yaakov is described in Hoseah 12,13 has having fled&nbsp;from .שדה ארם</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחות לבן הארמי</span><span class="font5">, the sister of Lavan from Aram. It is the custom of the Torah to describe the elder brother of a&nbsp;girl/woman as someone’s ancestry. Compare: מרים אחות אהרן,&nbsp;“Miriam, Aaron’s sister” (Exodus 15,12) or מחלת אחות נביות,&nbsp;“Machalat, Nevayot’s sister.” (Genesis 28,15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,21. ויעתר יצחק</span><span class="font5">, “Yitzchok prayed;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> continues with</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">:</span><span class="font5"> this word when used for prayer always describes an&nbsp;intense prayer, one reflecting the urgent need of the&nbsp;petitioner. He describes this as the meaning wherever we&nbsp;encounter this root in this mode. He proceeds to quote three&nbsp;verses from Scripture as proof. Then he adds that this rule&nbsp;applies to this word generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לנוכח אשתו</span><span class="font5">, “in order to enable his wife to conceive;” the expression נכח occurs in a similar sense in Judges 18,6 'נכח ה&nbsp;דרככם, “which the Targum renders as: “G’d will ensure that&nbsp;your mission will be successful,” i.e. אתקין ה' ארחכין.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He did not pray on his own behalf as he was aware that he was not sterile. The reason that he knew this was so was&nbsp;that G’d had told Avraham his father that his name would be&nbsp;carried on through his son Yitzchok. (Genesis 21,12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי עקרה היא</span><span class="font5">, ‘for she was barren;” what was the reason why Rivkah up to that point had been barren? G’d did not&nbsp;want the gentiles to be able to credit her fertility to the&nbsp;blessings that her family had bestowed on her when they&nbsp;said: “may you become the mother of thousands and tens of&nbsp;thousands.”(Genesis 24,60). She therefore could not&nbsp;conceive until G’d responded to her husband’s prayer on her&nbsp;behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתרוצצו</span><span class="font5">, “they quarreled;” the word means that&nbsp;something is about to be broken. Compare Chronicles II</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">16,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אם כן</span><span class="font5">, “if there is so much pain involved in pregnancy, why do I have to remain alive?” (I prefer to die immediately.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'ותלך לדרוש את ה</span><span class="font5">, “she went to obtain an answer to her problem from one of the prophets in her time.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">The answer she sought was why the fetuses inside her were&nbsp;engaged in a fight. She was well aware that her term of&nbsp;pregnancy had not yet been completed. She was afraid that&nbsp;after all these pains she might miscarry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר ה' לה</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord said to her:” by using a&nbsp;prophet to inform her; some commentators say that seeing&nbsp;that Avraham was still alive, she had turned to him and that&nbsp;he answered her; others say that the reason she had not told&nbsp;her </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">husband</span><span class="font5"> about her problem was that she did not want to&nbsp;cause him pain when hearing about her problem, and about&nbsp;the fact that G’d had not revealed the answer to him. The&nbsp;reason why Avraham answered her instead of her husband&nbsp;was why Yitzchok could not believe that Esau was a wicked&nbsp;person, as she never told him about all her problems and the&nbsp;answer she had received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שני גויים בבטנך</span><span class="font5">, “two (potential) nations are contained in your womb; the message was that Rivkah should not worry&nbsp;about what went on inside her womb at this time, as it was a&nbsp;preview of two nations each striving for supremacy over the&nbsp;other that would occur in history. One of these nations would&nbsp;experience a great deal more problems in the course of its&nbsp;history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even though the word for “nations” is spelled in our texts as גיים, it is to be read as if it had been spelled גוים in&nbsp;the regular way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ממעיך יפרדו</span><span class="font5">, “they are fighting for separation from one another already in your womb. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> on this expression,&nbsp;comments: “one wishes wickedness to prevail on earth, the&nbsp;other righteousness.” G’d implied that at this point in time the&nbsp;outcome of who would prevail in this struggle was not yet&nbsp;known. It would only become clear when the two children’s&nbsp;vocational choices had been made, one a hunter, the other a&nbsp;philosopher, making study his primary occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורב יעבוד צעיר</span><span class="font5">, “and the older will become subservient to the younger.” This is where the Torah decreed that Yaakov,&nbsp;though the younger, will eventually wind up as the senior one&nbsp;of the twins to be born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rav Hunna </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 63,6) is quoted as having said that it means if Yaakov merits it he will become the&nbsp;senior, if not, Esau will become senior to him. [Not found in&nbsp;the editions of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> at my disposal. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the word רב does not mean: “the senior one,” but simply means “הרבה,” a great deal,” or “for a&nbsp;long time</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.” </span><span class="font5">The word occurs when Esau first declined&nbsp;Yaakov’s gift by saying</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">: </span><span class="font5">יש לי רב, “I have lots.” (Genesis 33,9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,24. והנה תומם</span><span class="font5">, “and behold there were twins.” The&nbsp;word for “twins,” i.e. תומים, has been spelled defectively, the&nbsp;letter י being missing. The reason is to draw our attention to&nbsp;the fact that although, generally speaking, twins resemble&nbsp;each other greatly, in this instance the one was covered with&nbsp;body hair, while the other was smooth-skinned. Also, Esau&nbsp;was born with a foreskin, whereas Yaakov was born without.&nbsp;One, Esau, had reddish skin not resembling human skin,&nbsp;whereas Yaakov’s skin was good-looking. According to&nbsp;Psalms 80,14, the conquerors of Jerusalem are viewed as&nbsp;resembling wild boars, whereas in Jeremiah 50,17 Israel, i.e.&nbsp;Yaakov is described as a lamb. If they were all that different&nbsp;the question arises: “why were they born as twins?” After all,&nbsp;as the proverb says: “where there is straw there must also&nbsp;have been a harvest first.” To quote Ovadiah 1,18, ובית עשו&nbsp;לקש, “the house of Esau will be turned to straw.” We also&nbsp;have a verse: קדש ישראל לה' ראשית תבואתו, “Israel is sacred for&nbsp;G’d, the first of His harvest;” (Jeremiah 2,3). The reference to&nbsp;Yaakov in Rivkah’s womb the Torah describes him as the&nbsp;only one of the two twins who is worthwhile; hence the word&nbsp;is in the singular mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,25. ויצא הראשון </span><span class="font5">“the first one emerged;” why was he born first? In order that he together with any afterbirth, i.e.&nbsp;something dispensable and at the same time despicable&nbsp;content of the womb, would be discarded with the&nbsp;emergence of Esau. Rabbi Abahu illustrated this by means of&nbsp;a parable in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessikta Zutrata:</span><span class="font5"> when entering a bathtub or&nbsp;public bath, the servant always precedes his master in order&nbsp;to clear away any offensive residue left behind by the&nbsp;previous user.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the reason why Esau was born first is that he would inherit the material physical parts of the&nbsp;earth, which had been created before the world to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another version: he was born first as he was the product of the last drop of Yitzchok’s seminal ejaculation. We&nbsp;owe this insight to Rabbi Yossi, recorded from a conversation&nbsp;he had with a well educated lady, quoted in the above&nbsp;mentioned </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">midrash.</span><span class="font5"> He explained to her that if someone puts&nbsp;two pearls inside a tube sealed at one end, and he wants to&nbsp;access the first one he inserted, he first has to remove the&nbsp;ones he inserted at a later stage. In our story also, in order&nbsp;for the world to be able to enjoy the benefits Yaakov&nbsp;contributed to Judaism and thereby to mankind, Esau had to&nbsp;be born first, as he had blocked Yaakov’s way. Yaakov was&nbsp;conceived from Yitzchok’s first drop of semen so that he was&nbsp;innermost in Rivkah’s womb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אדמוני</span><span class="font5">, from the word אדם, a complete human being. The fact that he is also described as hairy like a fur coat is proof&nbsp;that the word אדמוני is not related to דם, blood; he did not&nbsp;appear as full of blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators view the verse as reflecting abbreviations, the word אדרת not being understood as in a&nbsp;construct mode to the word שער, hair. The meaning that&nbsp;results would be: “he was covered with hair as if wearing a&nbsp;mantle.” (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וידו אוחזת</span><span class="font5">, “with his hand grabbing;” the younger&nbsp;baby’s had is portrayed as holding on to the older twin’s heel&nbsp;already while still inside Rivkah’s womb. The author cites as&nbsp;proof for this Hoseah 12,4: בבטן עקב את אחיו, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">in the womb he&nbsp;tried to overtake his brother.” The word עקב is understood to&nbsp;mean: “heel, hoof.” Yaakov is presumed to have tried to&nbsp;prevent Esau from becoming the firstborn. He wanted to&nbsp;become the firstborn as he had developed from his father’s&nbsp;first drop of semen as quoted by Rabbi Yossi’s response to&nbsp;the lady’s question in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessikta Zutrata.</span><span class="font5"> This would enable&nbsp;Yaakov to claim the status of being the legal firstborn. His&nbsp;failure to prevent Esau from emerging from Rivkah’s womb&nbsp;first, prompted him years later to acquire that status through&nbsp;buying the birthright from his brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בן ששים שנה</span><span class="font5">, “sixty years old.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this that during the first ten years of their marriage Rivkah had&nbsp;not been old enough to conceive, and that during the ten&nbsp;years following he had waited before praying to have children&nbsp;as had his father Avraham during the first ten years in the&nbsp;land of Canaan. When she had failed to conceive during&nbsp;these years, he realised that she was barren and prayed on&nbsp;her behalf. He did not want to sleep with a Canaanite&nbsp;concubine, as his status of having been a burnt offering on&nbsp;the altar on Mount Moriah made this inappropriate. All&nbsp;Canaanites are viewed as “slaves,” both males and females.&nbsp;[The author’s quoting this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> at this point is interesting as&nbsp;he had previously gone to some length to prove that Rivkah&nbsp;could not have been so young when she got married. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויגדלו הנערים</span><span class="font5">, “the lads grew up;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments&nbsp;on this statement that they had attained the age of 13 at this&nbsp;point. During the years prior to this they did not show signs of&nbsp;developing radically different from one another. Until that age&nbsp;they had both been tutored by their father and been trained&nbsp;in how to become wholesome personalities, as pointed out in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 63,10. It is pointed out there that as of that&nbsp;age the father may thank the Lord that he has been relieved&nbsp;of the burden of raising his children. [Every father nowadays&nbsp;recites this blessing at his son’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bar mitzvah.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.] The&nbsp;deeper meaning of this is that from that day on a father is no&nbsp;longer held accountable for sins committed by his children.&nbsp;You might object by arguing that at the time of the sale of the&nbsp;birthright the children must have been at least 15 years old,&nbsp;seeing that our sages interpret the dish of lentils that Yaakov&nbsp;had cooked as having been the meal offered on the occasion&nbsp;of their grandfather Avraham being buried at the age of one&nbsp;hundred and seventy five, and they added that the reason&nbsp;that Avraham did not live to be one hundred and eighty, was&nbsp;to spare him the anguish of seeing his grandson Esau going&nbsp;astray spiritually. We know from the Torah that Avraham had&nbsp;been one hundred years of age when Yitzchok was born, so&nbsp;that at his death the children of Yitzchok must have been 15&nbsp;years of age. The answer given by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">midrash</span><span class="font5"> to this&nbsp;argument is that Esau had succeeded in keeping his wicked&nbsp;deeds secret or misrepresenting them as good deeds for two&nbsp;years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איש יודע ציד</span><span class="font5">, “his vocation was to use trickery to achieve his ends.” Trapping and hunting wild beasts cannot be done&nbsp;successfully without first deceiving those beasts, as man is&nbsp;physically weaker than they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression is also used by the Torah as Yitzchok, in due course, would ask Esau: הביאה לי ציד, “bring me some&nbsp;venison.” The Torah therefore had to tell us first that Esau&nbsp;had become a hunter of venison by profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יושב אהלים</span><span class="font5">, “according to the plain meaning this means that Yaakov tended sheep i.e. slept in tents as the sheep&nbsp;graze where they find meadows. Compare Genesis 4,20, אבי&nbsp;יושב אוהל ומקנה, “the founder of nomads tending sheep and&nbsp;cattle.” Another reason for describing Yaakov in such terms&nbsp;is that he was going to make his livelihood as a shepherd&nbsp;while at Lavan for 20 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,28. ויאהב יצחק את עשו</span><span class="font5">, “Yitzchok loved Esau;” in connection with Esau the Torah uses the past tense, i.e.&nbsp;ויאהב, to show that Yitzchok did not love Esau all the time, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">only at times when he provided him with venison. When describing Rivkah’s feelings for Yaakov, the Torah uses the&nbsp;present tense, אוהבת, as her feelings for him were constant.&nbsp;Furthermore, it is the nature of women to love those who look&nbsp;after her domestic animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,29. והוא עיף</span><span class="font5">, “and he was worn out;” it is usual for&nbsp;hunters to be worn out after chasing their prey. Moreover,&nbsp;sometimes they lose sight of their prey in the forest and get&nbsp;lost and it takes them a long time to find their way home.&nbsp;They may remain lost for a day or two, and when they finally&nbsp;get home they are totally worn out, hungry and thirsty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">מן האדום האדום, “from this reddish looking stuff.” Every time we encounter the adjective “red,” it always appears to&nbsp;be repeated. The author quotes as examples: אדמדם, ירקרק in&nbsp;Leviticus 13,19 and 49 .(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam).</span><span class="font5"> When someone&nbsp;requests something urgently, he is always in the habit of&nbsp;repeating the key words in such a request. Esau, on that&nbsp;occasion, was extremely in need of food and drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,31. מכרה כיום</span><span class="font5">, “Sell me effective immediately!” when the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot</span><span class="font5"> 32 states that a priest who has killed&nbsp;a person must not perform the priestly service in the Temple,&nbsp;the same applied before the sin of the golden calf during&nbsp;Avraham’s time when the priestly services were performed&nbsp;by the respective firstborn males of each family. The priests&nbsp;from the tribe of Levi were appointed only after that tragic&nbsp;occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: while it is true that a person is obligated to give honour to his older brother, the firstborn, no&nbsp;such rule exists when that firstborn is a wicked person.&nbsp;Yaakov no longer considered his brother Esau as worthy of&nbsp;being honoured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כיום, </span><span class="font5">effective as of today;” Yaakov referred to the extent that the rules for the privileges of the firstborns exist&nbsp;now. He knew that in the future the “birthright” would not be&nbsp;subject to being “sold” by the one who had been born to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the word כיום refers to the commercial value of such a birthright at that time. Clearly it&nbsp;had very little commercial value as so much could happen&nbsp;before the present owner of it could ever make commercial&nbsp;use of it. [Esau’s reference to his impending death in a&nbsp;hunting accident being a distinct possibility makes sense&nbsp;then. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.32. הנה אנכי הולך למות</span><span class="font5">, “here I am going to die;” (prematurely) the inheritance of the land of Israel promised&nbsp;by G’d to Avraham is linked to the birthright. Seeing that it&nbsp;will not be realised until after 400 years as G’d had told&nbsp;Avraham, (15,13) and seeing that Esau did not expect to live&nbsp;that long, of what benefit was the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">status</span><span class="font5"> of being the firstborn&nbsp;to him personally? What could he possibly lose by trading&nbsp;that status for a hot meal or a relatively small amount of&nbsp;money at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולמה זה לי הבכורה</span><span class="font5">, “what good is this birthright for </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">me?” </span><span class="font5">Esau means that if he could be assured that he would live&nbsp;that long he would not entertain the thought of selling his&nbsp;birthright, but since G’d Himself had told his grandfather that&nbsp;this would come true only in the fourth generation [and&nbsp;Avraham had therefore been able to make a pact of non&nbsp;aggression with Avimelech covering the next three&nbsp;generations, Ed.] he could sell such an entitlement for next to&nbsp;nothing. His own life was in danger daily due to his vocation&nbsp;as a hunter. In the very best set of circumstances his claim to&nbsp;the Land of Israel could only become of interest after their&nbsp;father Yitzchok had died. [Yitzchok was only 73-75 years old&nbsp;when this conversation took place. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;השבעה לי כיום </span><span class="font5">“swear it to me as of this day.&nbsp;Yaakov requested an oath that Esau would not change his&nbsp;mind about this deal at some time in the future. This was the&nbsp;only way that the sale would have meaning for him. He did&nbsp;so because the Talmud teaches that if someone announces:&nbsp;“I am making over to you whatever I will inherit from my&nbsp;father,” such a statement is legally meaningless. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Baba&nbsp;Metzia 16).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.34. 'ויעקב נתן לעשו וגו, </span><span class="font5">meanwhile Yaakov had already given to Esau, etc.;” at the same time when Esau had paid&nbsp;him money for the birthright, Yaakov had already fed him&nbsp;bread and a dish of lentils as proof that the sale had taken&nbsp;place. This was a normal procedure when commercial&nbsp;transactions took place in those days. We find an additional&nbsp;example of this in Genesis 31,46, when Yaakov and Lavan&nbsp;conclude a peace treaty by the stone monument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבז עשו את הבכורה</span><span class="font5">, “at that point Esau had shown that he despised the birthright;” until Aaron was appointed priest, the&nbsp;Temple service used to be performed by the firstborns of&nbsp;each family, regardless of which tribe they belonged to. In&nbsp;practice what Esau had done was as if he had said: “why&nbsp;should I dirty my hands with the blood of sacrificial animals,”&nbsp;as per Ezekiel 35,6: as I live, declares G’d: “I will doom you&nbsp;with blood, blood shall pursue you;” the reference is to the&nbsp;blood of circumcision as well as to that of sacrificial animals.&nbsp;Esau is presumed to have poked fun at the need of&nbsp;circumcision also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of the line: “Esau despised the birthright;” seeing that Esau did not want people to point at&nbsp;him as the fool who had sold his birthright, he made it plain&nbsp;that he despised the birthright and what it stood for. In the&nbsp;end, we know that he came to regret this as he accused&nbsp;Yaakov of having tricked him out of it. (27,36).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,1. ויהי רעב בארץ, </span><span class="font5">there was a famine in the land (Canaan); Yitzchok thought that this was a signal that the&nbsp;exile of Avraham’s descendants predicted to him was about&nbsp;to begin; this is why he headed for Egypt. G’d revealed to&nbsp;him that he had erred; this is why He told him not to proceed&nbsp;to Egypt but to remain within the boundaries of the land of&nbsp;Canaan. (Philistine region) He indicated to him that the exile&nbsp;in Egypt was not yet about to commence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מלבד הרעב הראשון</span><span class="font5">, “in addition to the previous famine,” (in his father’s lifetime) According to some commentators this&nbsp;was already the second famine in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Yitzchok’s</span><span class="font5"> lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וילך יצחק אל אבימלך</span><span class="font5">, “Yitzchok went to Avimelech” (whose land had not been affected, and with whom Avraham had&nbsp;made a reciprocal treaty.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מלך פלשתים גררה, </span><span class="font5">“the King of the Philistines whose capital was in G’ror.” At that time it had still been Yitzchok’s&nbsp;intention to use the land of the Philistines as a shortcut to&nbsp;Egypt. (Compare Exodus 13,17 where G’d did not use the&nbsp;land of the Philistines as a shortcut to lead the Israelites to&nbsp;the land of Canaan.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,3. </span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והקימותי את השבועה וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and I will keep My oath,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,4. 'ונתתי לזרעך וגו</span><span class="font5">, “I will give to your descendants, etc;” by repeating this oath, G’d specifically excluded&nbsp;Yishmael’s descendants from this promise. This was in spite&nbsp;of the fact that Yishmael was a descendant of Yitzchok’s&nbsp;father Avraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הארצות האל, </span><span class="font5">“these lands;” this was to make plain that the lands over which the King of the Philistines ruled at that&nbsp;time were included in the land G’d had promised to the&nbsp;descendants of Avraham. Our author had already explained&nbsp;this in his commentary on Genesis 22,1. The word: ה-אל, is&nbsp;an allusion to the 31 Kings Joshua would defeat and whose&nbsp;lands he would conquer after Moses’ death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והתברכו בזרעך</span><span class="font5">, “and through your descendants will be blessed;” Rabbi Yoseph son of Tuviah said: “through your&nbsp;descendants all the nations of the word will receive genetic&nbsp;input.” (Based on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah 43)</span><span class="font5"> אחד המבריך ואחד&nbsp;המרכיב, it does not matter whether he bends or grafts the&nbsp;vine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,5. עקב אשר שמע אברהם בקולי</span><span class="font5">, “as a consequence of Avraham having listened to My voice;” a reference to the&nbsp;binding of Yitzchok. The same formulation occurs also in&nbsp;Genesis 22,18: עקב אשר שמעת בקולי, “(G’d to Avraham) “as a&nbsp;consequence of your having listened to My voice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישמור משמרתי</span><span class="font5">, “he observed My commandments;” this is a reference to the commandment of circumcising himself&nbsp;which he immediately accepted as recorded in Genesis 7,10:&nbsp;'זאת בריתי אשר תשמרו וגו, “this is My covenant that you are to&nbsp;observe;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מצותי</span><span class="font5">, “My directive;” a reference to circumcision to be performed on the eighth day after the baby’s birth, as is&nbsp;recorded: וימל אברהם את יצחק בנו בן שמונת ימים כאשר צוה אותו&nbsp;אלוקים, “Avraham circumcised his son Yitzchok on the eighth&nbsp;day as G’d had commanded him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">חקותי, “My statutes,” a reference to his commanding his children to continue the tradition he had commenced of&nbsp;circumcising himself, as is recorded: והיתה בריתי בבשרכם לברית&nbsp;עולם, ”My covenant shall be on your flesh as an eternal</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">covenant.” (17,13) Also compare Psalms 105,10: ויעמידיה ליעקב לחוק, “He confirmed it in a decree for Yaakov.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותורותי</span><span class="font5">, “and My teachings;” this is a reference to the beginning of chapter 12 where G’d instructs Avraham to&nbsp;leave home and to proceed to a land that He will show him.&nbsp;As proof that this interpretation is correct, the author quotes&nbsp;Psalms 32,8: אשכילך ואורך בדרך זו, “Let me enlighten you and&nbsp;show you which way to go.” [The subject speaking in that&nbsp;verse is the Holy Spirit. (Alshich) He quotes a similar verse&nbsp;from Psalms 32,8. Whenever the word תורה occurs, it refers&nbsp;to teaching as a prelude to commanding the listener to&nbsp;conduct himself in accordance with it. As a result he claims&nbsp;that our verse taken together refers to the 7 universal laws&nbsp;that apply to all of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישאלו אנשי המקום לאשתו</span><span class="font5">, “The inhabitants of that&nbsp;place enquired about the marital status of the woman&nbsp;accompanying him.” The reason why Rivkah was not&nbsp;abducted immediately, as had been Sarah when Avraham&nbsp;had stayed in Avimelech’s country, is that Avraham had at&nbsp;the time warned the Philistines by saying to them at the time:&nbsp;“since when is the first thing you ask a stranger about the&nbsp;status of the people who accompany him?” Compare Talmud&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> 92.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פן יהרגוני</span><span class="font5">, “lest they kill me;” Avraham at the time had ultimately not been afraid to tell Avimelech that Sarah was&nbsp;his wife as it had become known how he and a few men had&nbsp;defeated Amrafel and his mighty armies in battle. At this&nbsp;point they had no reason to be afraid of Yitzchok, seeing he&nbsp;had not performed deeds of valour. This is why he was afraid&nbsp;to tell the people there that Rivkah was his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי טובת מראה היא</span><span class="font5">, “for she was good-looking;” the word מאד, “very much,” is absent here whereas it had appeared in&nbsp;connection with Rivkah before she had mothered twins.&nbsp;(Compare 24,16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי כי ארכו לו הימים</span><span class="font5">, “it happened seeing that&nbsp;Yitzchok had to abstain from marital relations for an&nbsp;extended period;” (so that it had become permissible for him&nbsp;to indulge in such relations even in daytime to prevent&nbsp;involuntary ejaculation. Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah 64,5);</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישקף אבימלן* בעד החלון</span><span class="font5">, “Avimelech took a look through the window;” according to some commentators the window&nbsp;had not been open but had in fact been securely locked. This&nbsp;fact led Avimelech to conclude that Yitzchok and his wife&nbsp;were engaged in activities that were extremely private. Even&nbsp;when marital intercourse is permitted in daytime, the room in&nbsp;which it takes place must be dark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וירא, והנה יצחק מצחק את רבקה</span><span class="font5">, “he looked and here he saw that Yitzchok was engaged in intimacies with Rivkah.”&nbsp;This expression for describing intimacies with the opposite&nbsp;sex is found when the wife of Potiphar tells the servants in&nbsp;her husband’s household that this is what the Hebrew slave&nbsp;tried to do to her. (Genesis 39,14). In that verse the next&nbsp;words are: לשכב עמי, “to sleep with me;” from this we are able&nbsp;to deduce that Avimelech did </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">witness actual intercourse&nbsp;but only foreplay. Yitzchok most certainly would not have&nbsp;engaged in marital relations unless he was sure that no&nbsp;peeping Tom could witness this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,10. אחד העם, </span><span class="font5">“someone from the common people;”&nbsp;the word occurs in this sense in Samuel I 26,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והבאת עלינו אשם</span><span class="font5">, “and you would have brought guilt upon us.” He referred to the pact of friendship between Avraham&nbsp;and Avimelech’s father.” [The name “Avimelech,” presumably&nbsp;is a title, just as Pharaoh was a title for every King of Egypt.&nbsp;Ed.] Violating an oath requires a guilt offering in Jewish law,&nbsp;compare Leviticus 5, 24-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,12. מאה שערים</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> writes that our sages said that the meaning of the expression (שער(ים here is “estimate.”&nbsp;Either, according to Onkelos, Yitzchok’s harvest was 100&nbsp;times as much as could be expected, or that he had to tithe&nbsp;100 times as much as he had expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,15. סתמום פלשתים</span><span class="font5">, “the Philistines had stopped up.” They had argued that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">their</span><span class="font5"> land had not been blessed on&nbsp;account of the famine they had experienced. Therefore they&nbsp;were jealous of Yitzchok’s success, and tried to limit it as&nbsp;much as was in their power. [Avraham had not been a&nbsp;farmer, so that he had dug wells from altruistic motives. If the&nbsp;land of the Philistines either in Avraham’s time or in&nbsp;Yitzchoks’ time had suffered</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">from a famine, why would either Avraham or Yitzchok have gone there, seeing they needed grazing for their sheep&nbsp;and herds? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,16. לך מעמנו</span><span class="font5">, “go from us;” they argued that the reason they wanted him to leave was that they felt their land&nbsp;had not been blessed due to the famine, as opposed to the&nbsp;piece of land on which Yitzchok had brought forth such an&nbsp;exceptionally good harvest. They assumed that as soon as&nbsp;Yitzchok would vacate the land he had worked they would&nbsp;appropriate it for themselves and reap the benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,18. כשמות אשר קרא להן אביו</span><span class="font5">, “as had been their names when his father had named them.” He wished to draw&nbsp;attention to the fact that the success of these wells had been&nbsp;and continued to be due to the merit of his father. In order to&nbsp;prove that this was so, when he left the vicinity of&nbsp;Avimelech’s capital and settled where Avraham had lived for&nbsp;a while and demonstrated that the success depended not on&nbsp;the quality of the earth and the skill of its farmers, but on the&nbsp;goodwill enjoyed by them in the heavenly spheres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לאמור לנו המים</span><span class="font5">, saying: “the water is ours.” They&nbsp;argued that the water from the well had originally been&nbsp;flowing in the river that was theirs. They used the same&nbsp;argument with the second well Yitzchok’s servants brought&nbsp;in. When Yitzchok moved away further and again succeeded&nbsp;in bringing in a well, they finally realised that it was he who&nbsp;was blessed, and that he had not robbed them of anything.&nbsp;(verse 22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרא שמה שטנה</span><span class="font5">, “he named that well: “hatred.”&nbsp;We must not understand the name of this well as reflecting&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font5">sentiments as the previous well he had dug, as at&nbsp;that time the name עשק, “dispute,” reflected that he gave the&nbsp;Philistines the benefit of the doubt when they claimed that&nbsp;the waters that came out of that well had previously flowed in&nbsp;their river. When they disputed his right to the second well,&nbsp;he became convinced that their arguments were malicious&nbsp;and not based on a legitimate claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויעל משם באר שבע</span><span class="font5">, “he moved uphill from there to&nbsp;B’eer Sheva.This was the B’eer Sheva where his father had&nbsp;stayed for many years, which is not far from Chevron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל תירא כי אתך אני</span><span class="font5">, “Do not fear for I am with you;”&nbsp;G’d appeared to him at this point as he had been greatly&nbsp;disturbed by the hostile attitude displayed by the Philistines&nbsp;time and again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,26. ואחוזת</span><span class="font5">; some commentators (quoted by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baal Haturim)</span><span class="font5"> understand this word as being a personal name as&nbsp;opposed to a title or rank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מרעהו</span><span class="font5">, a friend of Avimelech; the letter מ in this word would then be part of his name; an example of something&nbsp;similar is found in Judges 14,20: ויתנה לרעהו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">he (the father&nbsp;of Shimshon’s wife gave her to someone by the name of&nbsp;מרעהו.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pessikta zutrata)</span><span class="font5"> The word: אחוזת would then not be&nbsp;a personal name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,28. ראה ראינו</span><span class="font5">, “we have seen repeatedly;” the fact that you have succeeded twice where we have failed has&nbsp;convinced us that your G’d is on your side;” clearly your&nbsp;success is due to you personally, and not to the quality of the&nbsp;earth that you have either planted seeds in or dug wells in.&nbsp;We have noted that since you departed this earth has failed&nbsp;to be blessed. It is clearly </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> G’d Who is the cause and&nbsp;Who is with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בינותינו בינינו וביניך</span><span class="font5">, “between us; the oath that we swear by our deities shall now be binding both between us and&nbsp;you;” he meant that although Yitzchok swears in the name of&nbsp;his G’d, such an oath shall also be binding for them who&nbsp;swear in the name of their own deity. [The linguistic problem&nbsp;here is that the word בינינו, is otherwise completely&nbsp;superfluous. Ed].]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונכרתה ברית עמך, </span><span class="font5">“and we are willing to conclude a binding treaty with you;” an offer to renew the covenant&nbsp;Avraham had made with Avimelech’s predecessor for three&nbsp;generations.” They felt the need for this, since their having&nbsp;breached it Yitzchok might feel free to disregard it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,29. לא נגענוך</span><span class="font5">, “we have not harmed you bodily;” this&nbsp;was the reply to Yitzchok’s accusation that they had&nbsp;displayed their hatred for him. (verse 27) They used the fact&nbsp;that they had allowed him to leave unharmed as proof that&nbsp;they had not hated him, as they had made no attempt to&nbsp;harm him or his family physically. We may understand the&nbsp;words: לא נגענוך, as well as the words: “we have only done&nbsp;good with you,” as referring to the past as well as to the&nbsp;future. We find a similar formulation in the Scriptures in&nbsp;Psalms 9,19: כי לא לנצח ישכח אביון תקוות עניים תאבד לעד, “not&nbsp;always shall the needy by ignored, nor the hope of the&nbsp;afflicted forever lost.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אתה עטה ברוך ה</span><span class="font5">, “you are now the one blessed by the Lord.” They wanted to forestall Yitzchok saying to them that&nbsp;before making </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> swear as the son of Avraham to keep the&nbsp;peace, they should first secure such a sworn undertaking&nbsp;from his brother Yishmael. [Yitzchok understood that the&nbsp;word עתה, “now,” reflected their worry about Yitzchok saying&nbsp;this to him. After all, when the Philistines breached the&nbsp;covenant made with Avraham for three generations they had&nbsp;also freed Yishmael from the obligation to observe its terms.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By using the words 'אתה </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עתה ברוך ה, </span><span class="font5">they implied that they had reason to be afraid of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5">, whereas they had no&nbsp;reason to fear that they could not cope with Yishmael. G’d,&nbsp;after all, had not promised their land to Yishmael’s&nbsp;descendants. They were aware that G’d had bestowed the&nbsp;blessing He had given to Avraham, especially his power to&nbsp;bless and cure, to Yitzchok, as soon as Avraham had died.&nbsp;(25,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,33. על כן שם העיר באר שבע, </span><span class="font5">“this is why the name of the town was </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’eer sheva.</span><span class="font5"> If you were to question that that&nbsp;name for this well (site) had already been given to it by&nbsp;Avraham, so why does the Torah let us think that this was&nbsp;something new? We must understand the meaning of the&nbsp;verse as follows: Yitzchok named the well mentioned in&nbsp;verse 32 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shivah,</span><span class="font5"> “seven,” because he had named the town&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’eer sheva.</span><span class="font5"> Actually, originally the name was a reminder of&nbsp;the “oath” שבועה, not the “number” שבע.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the question how Yitzchok could enter into a business arrangement with a pagan, the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avodah&nbsp;Zarah</span><span class="font5"> considers the prohibition based only on such deals&nbsp;leaving a wrong impression on other Jews, something that&nbsp;was not relevant as yet. This was also the reason that the&nbsp;Philistines came to Yitzchok there, as they wanted to renew&nbsp;the oath at the place it had been concluded originally. There&nbsp;is also the problem of Exodus 23,13 that “the name of an&nbsp;alien deity shall not cross your lips,” i.e. you must not be&nbsp;heard uttering it. [I have not understood how Yitzchok could&nbsp;have become guilty of this in this connection. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,35. ותהיין מורת רוח</span><span class="font5">, “both of these daughters-in-law became sources of frustration to both Yitzchok and Rivkah.&nbsp;We see this from Rivkah’s justifying her wishing to take a&nbsp;wife from her family (27,46) by telling her husband that if&nbsp;Yaakov were to take wife from the local Hittite population she&nbsp;would get fed up with her very life. What can describe more&nbsp;graphically her and her husband’s frustration at the choice of&nbsp;wives Esau had made? Moreover, it is likely that if these&nbsp;daughters-in-law had been compatible with them they would&nbsp;all of them have lived in one house. The fact that they did not&nbsp;live under one roof is clear, as Yaakov would never have&nbsp;gotten away with deceiving his father by pretending to be&nbsp;Esau if Esau’s wives had lived in the same house! He had&nbsp;expelled them from his house on account of their conduct. [I&nbsp;find this argument very weak, as in Genesis 2,24 already the&nbsp;Torah describes a son marrying and setting up house for&nbsp;himself and his wife as being the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">norm</span><span class="font5"> and not the exception.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ליצחק ולרבקה</span><span class="font5">, “to Yitzchok and to Rivkah.” According to our sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 65,4, Yitzchok was the first to&nbsp;experience this dissatisfaction with Esau’s wives’ conduct. It&nbsp;is explained that the reason is psychological. Rivkah, who&nbsp;had grown up in an environment of pagans, did not become&nbsp;affronted so easily by Hittite girls not yet having abandoned&nbsp;every nuance of their former pagan backgrounds, whereas&nbsp;Yitzchok, used be surrounded only to holiness,-at least in his&nbsp;father’s house and his wife’s house-was far more sensitive to&nbsp;this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis: Normally, women spend most of their time in the home and therefore become aware of what other&nbsp;women in their homes do. Men, whose lifestyle usually&nbsp;requires them to spend more time outdoors, are not privy to&nbsp;what goes on inside the house. Yitzchok, being blind, and&nbsp;therefore housebound, not being preoccupied with mundane&nbsp;activities in the kitchen, etc., had a keener sense of hearing&nbsp;and overheard more inappropriate remarks made by his&nbsp;daughters-in-law than did Rivkah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותכהינן עיניו</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font5">eyes had become weak; but not&nbsp;Rivkah’s eyes; this is so because woman was created from&nbsp;man’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">bone</span><span class="font5">, as were the wives of Esau, and we have a rule&nbsp;that one bone does not harm another bone. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Tanchuma&nbsp;Toldot 8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[When bone hits bone nothing breaks. When bone hits vessels made of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">earth</span><span class="font5">(enware) the latter is liable to be&nbsp;shattered. When G’d made Adam, He used </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">earth</span><span class="font5">. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: Rivkah’s eyes, which had been used to the smoke emanating from sacrifices offered to idols,&nbsp;had become immune to that smoke from childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא ידעתי יו</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מותי</span><span class="font5">, I do not know when I shall die;” if&nbsp;I were to die suddenly, you (Esau) will lose all your money&nbsp;and your authority as you have sold your birthright to&nbsp;Yaakov. Therefore I wish to anticipate such an event by&nbsp;giving you my wealth while I am still alive so that Yaakov&nbsp;cannot deprive you of what was yours from birth. Gifts made&nbsp;during one’s lifetime cannot be challenged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תליך</span><span class="font5">, “your quiver,” the bag fastened around one’s&nbsp;midriff containing the supply of arrows;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וצודה לי ציד, “</span><span class="font5">and hunt some game for me.” If you were to question how it is possible for Yitzchok to have been&nbsp;eating the meat of animals that had not died through ritual&nbsp;slaughter even inadvertently, seeing that we have a&nbsp;statement by our sages that G’d protects the righteous from&nbsp;becoming guilty of this, seeing that He even protects their&nbsp;livestock from becoming guilty of this? (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> 7) We&nbsp;have to answer that Yitzchok stopped eating meat&nbsp;slaughtered by Esau after he found out that he was a heretic.&nbsp;He acquired his name as a ציד בפיו, before he had become a&nbsp;heretic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">צידה</span><span class="font5">, the letter ה at the end of this word is unnecessary. Our sages explain it as an acronym, warning the ritual&nbsp;slaughterer of 5 possible problems that would invalidate the&nbsp;halachically acceptable slaughter of an animal, i.e ,שהייה&nbsp;דריסה, חלדה, הגרמה, עיקור, undue delay in completing the&nbsp;severing of the vital pipes; leaning on the knife performing&nbsp;the cutting; a rusty blade, sliding of the knife from the correct&nbsp;position, tearing loose either of the two pipes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והביאה לי ואוכלה</span><span class="font5">, “and bring it to me so that I may&nbsp;eat it.” Yitzchok said to Esau that he had sold his birthright in&nbsp;order to taste part of a single meal. He would now restore it&nbsp;to him by his acquiring the merit of feeding his father a meal&nbsp;prepared by him. This is what was meant by the words: הוי&nbsp;גביר לאחיך “become senior to your brother.” (27,29) [The&nbsp;reader is reminded that the blessing Yitzchok bestowed on&nbsp;the brother who fed him, Yaakov, had been intended for&nbsp;Esau. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעבור תברכני נפשי, </span><span class="font5">“so that my soul can bestow a blessing upon you.” Yitzchok said to Esau: “tonight is the night on&nbsp;which in the future the Israelites will all offer the Passover,&nbsp;and the angels will respond with many songs of praises to&nbsp;the Lord. This will make blessings pronounced today&nbsp;especially acceptable in heaven, as they will become part of&nbsp;the myriads of blessings uttered at this time.” (Based on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="font5"> chapter 32.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,7. 'ואברככה לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “I shall give you the blessing that is approved by the Lord.” [Seeing that after Avraham’s death&nbsp;the Lord had conferred his power to bless on his son&nbsp;Yitzchok. (Compare 25,11). Ed.] Yitzchok explained that this&nbsp;was why he encouraged Esau now to perform deeds to be&nbsp;worthy of such blessings. The author refers to his&nbsp;commentary on Genesis 10,9, in connection with the&nbsp;expression: 'גבור ציד לפני ה. The last two letters in the word&nbsp;ואברככה are כה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בדבר</span><span class="font5">, spelled with the “strong” ב.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,9. טובים</span><span class="font5">, “tasty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והבאת לאביך ואוכל</span><span class="font5">, “and bring it to your father so&nbsp;that he may eat it.” She meant that through eating and&nbsp;enjoying its taste he would be in the mood to bestow his&nbsp;blessing. It is a fact that Holy Spirit comes to rest on people&nbsp;only when they are in a good mood. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 30)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;איש שעיר, </span><span class="font5">according to the Jerusalem Targum, “a&nbsp;very virile and hairy man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והבאתי עלי קללה</span><span class="font5">, “I will bring a curse upon myself&nbsp;as I am bound to lie by saying ‘I am Esau;’ if I do not lie, he&nbsp;will not believe me.” Furthermore, all he has to do is to touch&nbsp;me and he will know that I am not Esau. He will curse me for&nbsp;having deceived him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עלי קללתך בני</span><span class="font5">, “neither you nor I need worry as I&nbsp;am certain that what G’d has told me before the two of you&nbsp;have been born will come true. So I can safely say that I will&nbsp;absorb any curse you might be cursed with.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: Rivkah meant that even if Yitzchok would subject Yaakov to a “touch-test” in order to assure&nbsp;himself that he was Esau, he would never curse him, as he&nbsp;would realise that you would never have tried to deceive him&nbsp;if I had not put you up to this charade. If he would curse&nbsp;anyone, he would curse me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third possible exegesis of this line: the curse would backfire on me; why would he curse someone who had&nbsp;brought him such tasty food? Our author uses the line </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על עמך&nbsp;ברכתך</span><span class="font5">, “Your blessing be upon Your people” in Psalms 3,9 as&nbsp;a comparison. [The curse in that context would befall the&nbsp;people mentioned in the previous verse. Ed.] You would only&nbsp;become cursed if you refused to carry out what I command&nbsp;you. Listen to me and go and get me the goats.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,15. החמודות</span><span class="font5">, “the valuable ones, the new ones with&nbsp;which Esau wants to impress the people with whom he&nbsp;deals. They are the ones which he wears when he performs&nbsp;tasks his father asks him to perform.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: החמודות, the one he wears always when he goes out hunting to kill venison. Your father is&nbsp;familiar with the smell of these garments and will not&nbsp;question the identity of the wearer of them. [This makes little&nbsp;sense to me, as Esau had already left on his errand to hunt&nbsp;game to feed his father. He would not likely have possessed&nbsp;two such sets of garments. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,16.הלבישה על ידיו</span><span class="font5">, “she placed on his hands and arms.” The reason why she took goats’ skins was that these&nbsp;hairs are harder than those of sheep and more closely&nbsp;resemble human hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,19. אנכי, עשו בכור</span><span class="font5">, “it is I; Esau is your firstborn.” There are some commentators who claim that Yaakov&nbsp;considered the situation as so critical for his future that he&nbsp;permitted himself the kind of lie his grandfather Avraham had&nbsp;used when he referred to his wife by saying that she was his&nbsp;sister. (Ibn Ezra) He had also used a similarly false&nbsp;statement before the binding of Yitzchok, when he told the&nbsp;accompanying lads that both he and Yitzchok would return to&nbsp;them from Mount Moriah, something which at that time was a&nbsp;lie, as he expected to slaughter Yitzchok. (Genesis 20,13)&nbsp;David in Samuel I 21,3 told the High Priest in the town of Nof&nbsp;that he was on a mission from his king, which was not true,&nbsp;as he was in the process of fleeing from him. The prophet&nbsp;Michayu told the king of Israel, Achav, in Kings I 22,15 who&nbsp;had asked him if his planned war to recapture Yavesh Gilad&nbsp;would be successful. He wished the king success, making it&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">appear</span><span class="font5"> that his answer was in the affirmative, though he&nbsp;knew that Achav would not return alive from that battle, but&nbsp;would be killed. In Kings II 8,10 the prophet Elisha sent a&nbsp;message to King Ben Haddad of Aram who was ill that he&nbsp;would recover, when he knew full well that this was not so.&nbsp;He had told the messenger whom the king had sent to him&nbsp;the truth, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of Yaakov’s words: “I am taking the place of Esau your firstborn.” He felt entitled to use this&nbsp;formulation as Esau had already sold him the birthright (48&nbsp;years earlier).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעבור תברכני נפשך</span><span class="font5">, “in order that your soul will bless me.” The question that presents itself here is if Yaakov only fed&nbsp;his father for the sake of receiving a reward? Yaakov spoke&nbsp;words that would help convince his father that he was Esau,&nbsp;as Yitzchok had said to Esau when he had not been present:&nbsp;בעבור תברכך נפשי, “so that my soul will bless you.” (verse 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,22</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הקול קול יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “the voice is distinctly the voice of Yaakov;” Yitzchok was not willing to base his judgment on&nbsp;the voice alone, as people are apt to disguise their voices on&nbsp;many occasions, both voluntarily and involuntarily. However&nbsp;he did not let this disturb him as the evidence of Yaakov’s&nbsp;arms and hands which were hairy were a much better&nbsp;indication that Esau indeed was standing in front of him. This&nbsp;was why he proceeded to give him the blessing he had&nbsp;intended to give Esau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,25. ויבא לו יין וישת</span><span class="font5">, “he brought his father wine and Yitzchok drank it.” Wine was apt to confuse a person’s mind&nbsp;at times, so that he would not proceed further with worrying if&nbsp;this was indeed Esau or an impostor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,27. וירח את ריח בגדיו</span><span class="font5">, “he smelled the aroma of his clothes,” and as they smelled just as he expected them to&nbsp;smell,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמר: ראה בני, </span><span class="font5">he said: “see, “ etc; as soon as he had smelled the aroma of the clothes Yaakov wore he no longer&nbsp;had any doubts and began to bestow his blessing:&nbsp;commencing with the words: “see the fragrance emanating&nbsp;from my son is like the fragrance from the field;” he even&nbsp;omitted to say the first word in the line that we would have&nbsp;expected, i.e. “see my son, this fragrance is etc;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">a different exegesis: the word ראה can have a number of meanings depending on the context in which it appears.&nbsp;The equivalent word in other languages also has different&nbsp;meanings on different occasions. For instance: Deuteronomy&nbsp;1,8 </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ראה</span><span class="font5"> נתתי לפניכם את הארץ, “see here I have given to you the&nbsp;land;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כריח שדה</span><span class="font5">, “like the smell of the field;” Yitzchok smelled the field in which Esau made his livelihood reflected in the&nbsp;aroma exuded by the clothes he wore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'אשר ברכו ה</span><span class="font5">, “which the Lord has blessed;” some commentators understand these words not as applying to&nbsp;the field, but to Yitzchok’s son, i.e. בני; in other words: “my&nbsp;son whom the Lord has blessed.” The blessing he refers to is&nbsp;the gift of the land of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,31. יקום אבי</span><span class="font5">, “arise my father!” Esau awakened his father who had taken a nap after having eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,33. ויחרד יצחק</span><span class="font5">, “Yitzchok became frightened;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> he had a vision of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gehinom</span><span class="font5"> opening up&nbsp;beneath him. He had this vision as soon as he wanted to&nbsp;curse Yaakov for having deceived him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand the expression as Yitzchok now realising that if he could not even have known&nbsp;the difference between his two sons he could no longer be&nbsp;surprised why he had been struck with blindness as a&nbsp;punishment. Nonetheless, there was one thing he was not&nbsp;frightened of. Seeing that nothing is concealed from G’d, how&nbsp;could He have allowed the birthright to be transferred from&nbsp;the older son to the younger son?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גם ברוך יהיה “</span><span class="font5">he shall also remain blessed.” Yitzchok reasoned that seeing that he had intended to bless his&nbsp;firstborn son, and Yaakov had bought the birthright already a&nbsp;long time ago, he had actually blessed the son to whom this&nbsp;blessing belonged legally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third exegesis: seeing that I already said to Yaakov that anyone who would curse him shall himself become&nbsp;cursed, if I cursed him now I would bring a curse upon&nbsp;myself. If you, the reader were to ask me, if so at least&nbsp;Yitzchok should not have given Yaakov an </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">additional&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">blessing? The answer is that I also said that anyone who&nbsp;would bless him should be blessed. Therefore it is in my own&nbsp;interest to bestow another blessing upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation for the words: “he shall also retain the blessing;” Yitzchok asked G’d to confirm the&nbsp;blessing that he had bestowed upon Yaakov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקח ברכתך</span><span class="font5">, “he has taken the blessing that I&nbsp;meant to bestow upon you.” Yitzchok meant that the reason&nbsp;that he had wanted to bestow this blessing on Esau&nbsp;originally, was only because biologically speaking, he had&nbsp;been the firstborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את בכורתי לקח</span><span class="font5">, “he had purchased my birthright;”&nbsp;with these words he tripped himself up by revealing that&nbsp;Yaakov was legally entitled to this blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,37. ואת כל אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “and all his brothers, etc.;” Yitzchok refers to Yishmael and his extended family and the children&nbsp;of Keturah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולכה</span><span class="font5">, “and as far as you personally are concerned;” the unusual spelling with the letters כה at the end is not a scribe’s&nbsp;error, but is deliberate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איפה מה אעשה בני</span><span class="font5">, “what can I do then my son?” Yitzchok explains that seeing that his descendants had been promised&nbsp;by G’d only the land of Canaan, and he had already “given”&nbsp;the whole of it to Yaakov’s descendants, there was no other&nbsp;inheritance he could pass on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הנה משמני הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “from the best parts of the land of&nbsp;Canaan will be your personal home;” Yitzchok referred to the&nbsp;region known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">har se-ir,</span><span class="font5"> which adjoins the ancestral region&nbsp;settled by the tribe of Yehudah, a very fruitful region and&nbsp;irrigated from the heavenly dews no less than the Holy Land&nbsp;itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How did Yitzchok know that G’d approved of the blessing he just pronounced? The reader is referred to&nbsp;Joshua 24,4 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואתן לעשו את הר שעיר</span><span class="font5">, “I gave to Esau the region&nbsp;of Mount Se-ir.” The formulation of יהיה מושבך, “is going to be&nbsp;your legal residence,” is supposed to mean that regardless of&nbsp;whether you or your descendants merit it, it is assured to&nbsp;you. If the matter were to depend on individual or collective&nbsp;merit, the promise would never be fulfilled. The problem with&nbsp;the promise to the Jewish people is that it was made by the&nbsp;Attribute of Justice, hence it is subject to the Israelites&nbsp;deserving it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.40. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועל חרבך תחיה</span><span class="font5">, “you will live by grace of your&nbsp;sword.” Yitzchok promises Esau that as a reward for having&nbsp;hunted deer in order to bring him delectable food, he will also&nbsp;henceforth be able to survive by his sword in his dangerous&nbsp;vocation. [The word “sword” here is used by Yitzchok as a&nbsp;general term for instruments used to kill, seeing that Esau&nbsp;had hunted for him with bow and arrow. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת אחיך תעבוד</span><span class="font5">, “but you will be subservient to your brother.” Esau had first complained that this is a put down for&nbsp;him. Yitzchok explains to him that prevailing in military&nbsp;confrontations is never a “put down,” but on the contrary, the&nbsp;victors are held in high esteem and are feared. Esau&nbsp;complained that having to live by constant confrontation with&nbsp;others is a very demanding task; Yitzchok answers that he&nbsp;has the option to be peaceful and subservient to his brother.&nbsp;If so, his brother will surely display mercy and tolerance for&nbsp;him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר תריד</span><span class="font5">, an unusual expression, similar to Psalms 55,3: אריד בשמחי, “I am complaining;” Yitzchok assures him&nbsp;that if in the future the descendants of his brother will&nbsp;oppress those of Esau so that they will complain to Him, they&nbsp;will be able to shake off the yoke of the Israelites, i.e. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ופרקת&nbsp;עולו</span><span class="font5">. It is best for him to find himself another land in which to&nbsp;live so that he will never be exposed to subjugation by&nbsp;Yaakov’s descendants. [Esau chose to do so from his own&nbsp;free will, as we know from Genesis 36,6-8. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternative exegesis for the words: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר תריד</span><span class="font5">. The root is ירד to descend, (compare Numbers 24,19, Bileam’s&nbsp;blessings) וירד מיעקב, “when </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">you</span><span class="font5"> rule then you will shake off&nbsp;his yoke.” We find that history proved Bileam correct when&nbsp;we read in Kings II 8,20, that during the rule of Yoram, son of&nbsp;Achav, the Edomites rebelled against his rule. They&nbsp;proceeded to set up a state of their own by crowning a king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,41. וישטום עשו את יעקב על הברכה</span><span class="font5">, “Esau hated Yaakov on account of the blessing;” there are some commentators&nbsp;who do not consider the words: על הברכה in our verse as&nbsp;referring to the blessing that Yaakov had “robbed” Esau of,&nbsp;but they consider these words as Esau’s complaint about the&nbsp;blessing that he did receive from his father, i.e. that he would&nbsp;always have to fight for his survival, על חרבך תחיה, “you will&nbsp;live (only) by the sword.” He placed a great deal of trust in&nbsp;that blessing. We would then have to understand our verse&nbsp;as follows: “Esau hated Yaakov, as from now on he had an&nbsp;assurance that by means of the sword he would always&nbsp;survive.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יקרבו ימי אבל אבי</span><span class="font5">, Esau was sure that his father would not live long enough to sire another son who could avenge&nbsp;Yaakov when he would murder him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואהרגה</span><span class="font5">, “when I shall kill, etc.” The letter ו is vocalised with the semi vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sheva,</span><span class="font5"> and the letter </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aleph</span><span class="font5"> with a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,42. ויגד לרבקה את דברי עשו בנה, </span><span class="font5">“Rivkah was informed of the words of her son Esau;” he was saying quite openly&nbsp;what was in his heart, i.e. that as soon as his father would&nbsp;die, he would murder his twin brother. Someone who had&nbsp;heard him say this told his mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.44. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ימים אחדים</span><span class="font5">, “one year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.45. למה אשכל גם שניכם יום אחד</span><span class="font5">, “why should your father and I be bereft of both of you on a single day? Rivkah&nbsp;referred tgo her becoming widowed on the day Yitzchok&nbsp;would die, and immediately thereafter would also be bereft of&nbsp;Yaakov when Esau would carry out his threat. (verse 41)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The principal commentary on this line is that of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi, </span><span class="font5">who understands Rivkah as saying to Yaakov that even if he&nbsp;were to kill Esau first, his sons would avenge him by killing&nbsp;him. The word: גם, “also,” in this verse refers to herself, who&nbsp;meant that if she were to lose both her sons she would&nbsp;consider herself as dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יום אחד</span><span class="font5">, even though they might not both die on the same day, they would be buried on the same day. (Based on&nbsp;the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.46. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם לוקח יעקב אשה מבנות חת</span><span class="font5">, “if Yaakov were to&nbsp;take a wife from amongst the Hittites;” She said this only in&nbsp;order to insure that Yaakov would be physically out of reach&nbsp;to Esau. [She could not imagine that Yaakov actually would&nbsp;do such a thing. Ed.] She wanted Yitzchok to specifically&nbsp;warn Yaakov not to marry a Hittite woman. She was afraid&nbsp;that unless specifically instructed, he would not want to leave&nbsp;his home and appear like a fugitive. He might instead marry&nbsp;someone from a powerful family and take his chances that&nbsp;they would protect him against his brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,3. </span><span class="font5">ואל שדי, “and the G’d known also as Shaddai;” the G’d Who has said of Himself that none of His creatures&nbsp;needs any other power to help him. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on&nbsp;Genesis 17,1) “He will bless you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Eleazar in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 67,12, says that a divorce decree becomes valid only after its signatories have&nbsp;appended their seals to it. This is why Yitzchok was not&nbsp;content with the blessing he had already given Yaakov which&nbsp;had commenced with the words: ויתן לך, in 27,28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לרשתך את ארץ מגוריך</span><span class="font5">, “to give you as an inheritance&nbsp;the land in which you presently are sojourning.” Seeing that&nbsp;you must not take a wife from the present occupiers of this&nbsp;land, Yitzchok had to re-confirm this. Not only that, he&nbsp;implied that seeing the Canaanites, ever since having been&nbsp;cursed by Noach, were a nation of slaves, slaves could not&nbsp;claim legal title to any possessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם יעקב ועשו</span><span class="font5">, “mother of Yaakov and Esau.” The&nbsp;Torah had to repeat this although the reader knows it, as the&nbsp;reader might wonder how a couple such as Yitzchok and&nbsp;Rivkah had produced a person as wicked as Esau. If Rivkah&nbsp;had not been the sister of a wicked person such as Lavan&nbsp;and daughter of a wicked person such as Betuel, the&nbsp;question would have been more serious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Personally, I think the verse is important as the Torah’s mentioning Yaakov first, i.e. confirming that he was the&nbsp;firstborn legally, having purchased that status from his&nbsp;brother. Moreover, we know that from the marriage of King&nbsp;Chizkiyah to the daughter of the prophet Isaiah the great&nbsp;prophet, a Jewish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rasha</span><span class="font5"> came forth, so that such phenomena&nbsp;are not strange seeing we have been given the freedom of&nbsp;choice. Ed.] Our sages, not basing themselves on the DNA&nbsp;factors, stated in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Batra</span><span class="font5"> 110, that most children reflect&nbsp;the character of their maternal uncles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the reason that mention is made of their mother here is that the Torah wants the reader to&nbsp;know that Rivkah did what she did for the benefit of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> her&nbsp;children. This is in line to when she said: “why would I have&nbsp;to lose </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> my children in one day?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,9. וילך עשו אל ישמעאל</span><span class="font5">, “Esau went to Yishmael;” Our sages in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Kamma</span><span class="font5"> 92, refer to a popular&nbsp;proverb saying that palms that do not produce fruit are&nbsp;usually found near other non fruit-bearing trees. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">understands the proverb as an allusion to wicked people&nbsp;keeping company with other wicked people. Our verse&nbsp;describing Esau as going to Yishmael to choose another wife&nbsp;is quoted as the Scriptural source for this proverb. We have a&nbsp;similar verse in the Book of Prophets Judges 11,3 where&nbsp;Yiftach is described as having kept company with common&nbsp;criminals. A third verse confirming this is found in Scriptures&nbsp;where we are told that birds keep company with other birds&nbsp;of the same species, and human beings with like minded&nbsp;other human beings. (no source specified) Apparently the&nbsp;verse is found in the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ben sirs,</span><span class="font5"> a text often quoted by the&nbsp;Talmud but not part of the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקח את מחלת בת ישמעאל</span><span class="font5">, “he married Machalat daughter of Yishmael.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Esau reasoned as follows: Yitzchok promised Yaakov the land of Canaan as the land of Israel in his second&nbsp;blessing. He also told him to take a wife from his own family&nbsp;but not from the Canaanites. Now that I married such&nbsp;women, this nullified my claim to the land of Canaan in the&nbsp;future. The only way he saw to overcome this obstacle was&nbsp;by marrying a descendant of Avraham, i.e. a daughter of&nbsp;Yishmael.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Vayetze</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,10. ויצא יעשב, “</span><span class="font5">Yaakov departed</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on these words that Yaakov was forced to leave the Holy Land&nbsp;on account of the women in that land being so unsuitable for&nbsp;him to marry. He means that the Torah had inserted matters&nbsp;in the story that were not connected to Yaakov starting with&nbsp;verse 6 of our chapter. Esau had not previously realised how&nbsp;opposed his father and mother had been to his wives. Now it&nbsp;resumes the story of Yaakov. If not for that, the name&nbsp;Yaakov would not have been needed at the beginning of this&nbsp;verse. Seeing that Yaakov left his home without fanfare, like&nbsp;a thief in the night, the Torah needed to refer to his departure&nbsp;as having been a fact. The manner in which this paragraph is&nbsp;written in the Torah scrolls reflects the fact that it was not&nbsp;drawn to the reader’s immediate attention by a new line or&nbsp;new </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">paragraph</span><span class="font5"> having been started. [It begins at the end of a&nbsp;line after space has been left open for only three letters in the&nbsp;same line. Ed.] All other portions, with the exception of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vayechi</span><span class="font5"> where there is only room for a single letter between&nbsp;the conclusion of the previous portion and the beginning of&nbsp;the new one, commence after a more distinct separation&nbsp;from the previous portion. An additional reason for the slim&nbsp;separation from verse is the fact that the story had been&nbsp;interrupted with telling us that his father had sent him to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Padan Arom</span><span class="font5"> in order to take a wife there from Rivkah’s&nbsp;family. The departure is mentioned a second time, on&nbsp;account of the dream with the ladder, and his proceeding to&nbsp;his destination. [Perhaps a better reason is that the Torah&nbsp;wished to hint that Yaakov did not proceed </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">directly</span><span class="font5"> to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Padan&nbsp;Arom</span><span class="font5"> but spent 14 years studying at the academy of Ever,&nbsp;great-grandson of Shem, son of Noach. This we know as&nbsp;otherwise 14 yeas of his life are unaccounted for. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באר שבע</span><span class="font5">, a site especially suited for the swearing of oaths. According to a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">midrash,</span><span class="font5"> Yaakov avoided staying at&nbsp;that place so as not to afford Avimelech an opportunity to&nbsp;extend the validity of the oath Avraham had sworn and which&nbsp;Yitzchok had confirmed for another generation or more. The&nbsp;באר שבע mentioned he is located close to Chevron, not to be&nbsp;confused with the modern </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’eer Sheva,</span><span class="font5"> located far more to&nbsp;the south. It was the באר שבע in which Avraham had&nbsp;sojourned for many years. It was very near קרית ארבע.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that the Torah reports Avraham returning from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Akeydah</span><span class="font5"> and settling in B’eer Sheva in 22,19 and 6&nbsp;verses later that Sarah died and he went to Kiryat Arba to&nbsp;bury her, certainly suggests that these two locations could&nbsp;not have been far apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וילך חרנה, </span><span class="font5">“he walked in the direction of Charan.” According to our sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 95 this means that he&nbsp;arrived in Charan still on the same day. He had travelled a&nbsp;number of days from Kiryat Arba. According to our sages it&nbsp;was17 days’ walk from Kiryat Arvaba to Charan, a distance&nbsp;which Yaakov covered in 12 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חרנה</span><span class="font5">, Charan and Padan Arom are both the same town. They were known by two different names; one name is used&nbsp;in connection with its being the town where Lavan resided,&nbsp;(Genesis 27,43) and immediately afterwards the Torah called&nbsp;it </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Padan Arom</span><span class="font5"> (28,2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,11. וילן ש</span><span class="font5">ם, “he spent the night there.” He was forced&nbsp;to do so by the prevailing conditions seeing that the sun had&nbsp;set. Concerning that line, כי בא השמש, Rav Yehudah&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> 2) stated that a person should make it a rule to&nbsp;commence any journey on Tuesdays, the day of which the&nbsp;Torah writes twice that G’d </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">saw</span><span class="font5"> that what He had created on&nbsp;that day was “good.” (Genesis 1,9-13) If the sun had not set&nbsp;unexpectedly, Yaakov would have kept walking to put more&nbsp;distance between himself and Esau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקח מאבני המקו</span><span class="font5">ם, “he took some of the stones lying around on that place” (to make some kind of headrest for&nbsp;himself). According to tradition these stones had been part of&nbsp;the altar on which his father Yitzchok had been bound on the&nbsp;occasion of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Akeydah.</span><span class="font5"> According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5">, during the&nbsp;night these stones fused so that when he awoke there was&nbsp;only one stone. We have a tradition also that the meaning of&nbsp;this phenomenon was that Yaakov’s children- as opposed to&nbsp;those of his father and grandfather,- would all remain true to&nbsp;their father’s religious outlook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span><span class="font5"> claim that Yaakov had taken only a single stone and that this is the reason why&nbsp;the Torah wrote immediately after these words: (after he&nbsp;awoke) “he took the stone which he had placed as his&nbsp;headrest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישכב במקום ההוא</span><span class="font5">, “he lay down in that place.” The Torah emphasises that he lacked the normal means to ensure a&nbsp;good sleep, i.e. sheets, cushion and a blanket to cover his&nbsp;body, even though he was very close to a town which could&nbsp;have furnished these items. This is why the Torah bothers to&nbsp;inform us that the name of that town used to be Luz when it&nbsp;was first founded. He was not forced to “rough” it, but seeing&nbsp;that he intended to get up early in the morning to continue on&nbsp;his journey, he chose to do this. We have proof of this when&nbsp;the Torah continued after relating his dream (18), with the&nbsp;words: וישנם יעקב בבקר, “Yaakov arose early in the morning.”&nbsp;If he had stayed at an inn in the town, he could not have left&nbsp;that early as the gates of the town were not yet open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the reason why he stayed outside of the town overnight is that he did not know where&nbsp;the entrance to the town was located as we know from&nbsp;Judges 1,24, where it is written concerning Luz: הראנו נא מבא&nbsp;העיר, “please show us where the entrance to the town is&nbsp;located.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,12. עולים ויורדים בו</span><span class="font5">, “ascending and descending on it.” They first ascended and then descended; afterwards they&nbsp;remained at the bottom. They behaved like a human being&nbsp;who climbs the ladder in his house to get to the loft, and then&nbsp;descends on it again. This is what led Yaakov to understand&nbsp;that this location was intended to become G’ds house on&nbsp;earth. He surmised that for the time being this was the&nbsp;residence of the angels he had seen. Angels, servants of the&nbsp;Lord, must have their residence in G’d’s house. If G’d was to&nbsp;establish a residence on earth also, they would have to&nbsp;ascend to heaven first in order to accompany their Lord to&nbsp;His alternate residence. If these angels were meant to only&nbsp;briefly remain on earth, the Torah should have described&nbsp;their movements as יורדים ועולים, “descending and then&nbsp;ascending, “(back to their residence)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Jerusalem Targum understands the function of these angels as having been to accompany Yaakov from&nbsp;here on in wherever he went. The reason that they ascended&nbsp;was to relay their messages to other angels in the celestial&nbsp;spheres that they had been assigned to descend to earth.&nbsp;They were to show them that there was a human being of the&nbsp;stature of Yaakov on earth. They would recognise him at&nbsp;once as a likeness of his features had long been engraved at&nbsp;the base of G’d’s throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,13. אברהם אביך</span><span class="font5">, “your father Avraham;” we learn from here that grandchildren are to treated as if they were one’s&nbsp;children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הארץ אשר אתה שוכב עליה, </span><span class="font5">“the earth that you are lying on;” what does the Torah tell us here that we did not know? G’d&nbsp;tells Yaakov that seeing that at this time he is receiving a&nbsp;minute amount of earth, this is symbolic of the fact that in&nbsp;due course his descendants will expand in all four directions&nbsp;of the globe. “You, i.e. they, will conquer all the land that is&nbsp;presently around you.” It was a well known practice in those&nbsp;days that kings who wished to reward their most important&nbsp;subjects would do so by symbolically giving them a token of&nbsp;the real reward. The recipients would then be free to&nbsp;personally, or with the help of their servants, conquer the&nbsp;lands the king had assigned for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here describes G’d as symbolically folding the whole of the land of Israel beneath Yaakov’s head. All this&nbsp;G’d showed him in the dream in which he saw the ladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,15. ושמרתיך</span><span class="font5">, “I will guard you;” this was necessary&nbsp;because of Esau’s threat to kill Yaakov. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והשיבותיך אל האדמה&nbsp;הזאת</span><span class="font5">, “I will bring you back to this soil;” this promise was&nbsp;fulfilled as stated in Genesis 35,27: וישב יעקב אל יצחק אביו&nbsp;“Yaakov returned to his father Yitzchok.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי לא אעזבך</span><span class="font5">, “for I shall not abandon you;” on this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אשר דברתי לך </span><span class="font5">“what I have said to you;” to bring you back to this soil. People always need protection when on a&nbsp;journey. For proof the author cites: Psalms 91,11: לשמרך בדרך,&nbsp;“to guard you while you are on the way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,17. אין זה כי אם בית אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “this can only be the house of G’d.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains this exclamation as follows quoting&nbsp;Rabbi Elazar in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 69,7: “the foot of the ladder&nbsp;was in B’eer Sheva. It stood at an angle so that the halfway&nbsp;mark was precisely above the site where the Temple would&nbsp;be built in the future; its top would have been above Bet El.”&nbsp;[Bet El being the northernmost point and B’eer Sheva the&nbsp;southern most point. Jerusalem would be at the half way&nbsp;mark. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אין זה כי אם בית אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “this can only be (the location of) the House of G’d.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> endeavours to find the source for&nbsp;the statement by the sages that G’d had said that it is&nbsp;intolerable that a righteous person of the calibre of Yaakov&nbsp;who needed a place to spend the night, should be unable to&nbsp;find more than a stone to lay his head on. Also why would&nbsp;Yaakov call the place that had been known as Luz&nbsp;“Yerusalem,” i.e. the house of G’d? Furthermore why&nbsp;afterwards does he refer to “Beyt El,” a place much further&nbsp;north? Clearly there appears to be some contradiction here!&nbsp;Our sages themselves seem to have had second thoughts&nbsp;when they said that Yaakov renamed called Luz as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beyt El</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being aware of these difficulties, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> says; “therefore I say that Mount Moriah had been moved and Yaakov had&nbsp;arrived there, i.e. as far as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beyt El,</span><span class="font5"> (all on the same day)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[If any reader finds all this as strange, I remind him that if G’d enabled Eliezer, Avraham’s servant, to cover a similar&nbsp;distance with his 10 camels when he went to look for a wife&nbsp;for his master in the course of one day, then Yaakov’s&nbsp;experience can certainly not be considered as so&nbsp;unbelievable. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is also the problem that Yaakov instead of walking from B’eer Sheva to Charan would be travelling from&nbsp;west to East, as testified to by Isaiah 9,11 ארם מקדם ופלשתים&nbsp;מאחור, “Aram to the East and the land of the Philistines at the&nbsp;back.” (to the west) Moreover, we (our author) had previously&nbsp;explained that Aram and Charan are one and the same.&nbsp;(compare verse 10). According to what we have read here&nbsp;Yaakov was traveling from the south to the north according&nbsp;to what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explained earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have to say that Yaakov travelled the same route that his grandfather Avraham had traveled when coming from&nbsp;Charan, southward after having left both Ur Casdim and&nbsp;Charan on his way to the land of Canaan. He had proceeded&nbsp;southward in stages all the way to B’eer Sheva. Both he and&nbsp;Yitzchok had taken up residence in towns on this route from&nbsp;time to time as we have read in previous portions of the&nbsp;Torah. The route was well known and they were familiar with&nbsp;it. This is the reason why Yaakov also used this route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> quoting Yaakov as having said that possibly he had failed to stop at a place where his father and&nbsp;grandfather had offered prayers to G’d, this must have&nbsp;referred not to Mount Moriah, for he had prayed there&nbsp;repeatedly as stated by our sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> at the&nbsp;end of chapter 78,16, where we are told that no one can&nbsp;properly appreciate how many libations Yaakov had offered&nbsp;at Mount Moriah, but to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beyt El,</span><span class="font5"> for Avraham had prayed&nbsp;there and built an altar as recorded in Genesis 12,7-8. Our&nbsp;sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 44 are on record that if Avraham had not&nbsp;prayed between </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beyt El</span><span class="font5"> and Ai, the Jewish people would&nbsp;long ago have perished completely (Joshua 7,25 when they&nbsp;were defeated there during the first encounter They were&nbsp;saved only due to the merit acquired by the prayers Avraham&nbsp;had offered in that region.) The reason that this location is&nbsp;referred to as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beyt El</span><span class="font5"> is on account of the prayers offered&nbsp;there in the future, for in Yaakov’s time it was still known as&nbsp;Luz. Yitzchok had also offered prayers at that altar which his&nbsp;father Avraham had built. Even though we do not possess a&nbsp;written record of it, it is quite plausible to assume that he&nbsp;used this altar on numerous occasions in order to offer&nbsp;prayers. Yaakov, on the other hand, had not had an&nbsp;opportunity to offer prayers at that location up until now. This&nbsp;is also why he said: “is it possible that I simply passed by this&nbsp;place without stopping to offer up a prayer?” He therefore&nbsp;decided to retrace his steps </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> coming to Charan, and to&nbsp;go back as far as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beyt El</span><span class="font5"> to offer a prayer there. In response&nbsp;to Yaakov’s determination to do so, G’d folded the earth&nbsp;beneath him to expedite matters. What this meant in practice&nbsp;was that the town known as Luz was transported to the&nbsp;vicinity of Charan, saving him many days of walking. G’d’s&nbsp;motivation was that the prayer of a righteous person such as&nbsp;Yaakov should preferably be said in a Temple or other&nbsp;sacred site. As a result, the mountain of Moriah was&nbsp;immediately uprooted and removed as far as Charan. After&nbsp;having prayed there Yaakov continued on his way. When G’d&nbsp;saw that, He said: seeing that this righteous person has&nbsp;taken so much trouble to come to My residence, how can I&nbsp;allow him not to have shelter for the night? This is why He&nbsp;arranged for the sun to set prematurely so that Yaakov would&nbsp;spend the night there. During that night he dreamt the dream&nbsp;reported in detail in our chapter where it became clear to him&nbsp;that the place he had slept was destined to become a&nbsp;Temple in the future. Realising that this was the meaning of&nbsp;the dream, he called the site “house of G’d,” renaming the&nbsp;town of Luz to be known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beyt El.</span><span class="font5"> (House of G’d). This is&nbsp;the meaning of the line: “he called that site </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beyt El,</span><span class="font5"> the site&nbsp;being that which had previously been known as the town of&nbsp;Luz. The stone which had served as Yaakov’s “pillow,” which&nbsp;had come from Mount Moriah, remained at that site. Yaakov&nbsp;anointed it with oil as a symbol of its future significance. As&nbsp;soon as he had done this, he proceeded on his trek to&nbsp;Charan. It would be wrong to understand the verse as&nbsp;meaning that Yaakov arose in the morning in the town of&nbsp;Charan. This is clear from the Torah telling us in 19,1 that&nbsp;Yaakov then set out in the direction of the people residing in&nbsp;the land of the Orientals. When he met the shepherds&nbsp;huddled around the well he asked them where their home&nbsp;was and they told him that their home was Charan. When&nbsp;Yaakov, 20 years later, was on the way from Lavan to the&nbsp;land of Canaan, he passed this location and he named the&nbsp;site </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beyt El</span><span class="font5"> and erected a monument at the site. (Genesis&nbsp;35,7, and 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[This is a unique exegesis, as, normally, Yaakov is understood as having had to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">return</span><span class="font5"> to that site </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> having&nbsp;already settled in the land of Canaan and having overlooked&nbsp;his promise to erect a Temple at that site so that G’d had to&nbsp;remind him. (compare chapter 33,18 -30) Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וזה שער השמים</span><span class="font5">, “and this is the gateway to heaven.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Yaakov referred to the Temple in heaven&nbsp;which is understood to be “opposite” the terrestrial Temple.&nbsp;If, you the reader were to ask how it is possible that the&nbsp;Temple in heaven is opposite that on earth, seeing that the&nbsp;site of that Temple had been moved by G’d, as we have&nbsp;explained?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer is that it had been moved to be next to Yaakov. When Yaakov had traveled, the site of the terrestrial&nbsp;Temple had always moved with him, as the miracle had been&nbsp;performed for him and not for a piece of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,18. ויקח את האבן</span><span class="font5">, “he took the stone;” according to the sages in Pirkey de rabbi Eliezer, chapter 35, this stone&nbsp;was the one known in later generations as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">even shetiyah’&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">symbolising the navel of the globe a mystical stone at the site&nbsp;where the Holy Ark had stood in the Holy of Holies during the&nbsp;first Temple. This stone, if removed, would expose a hole&nbsp;going down to the center of the earth. It is supposed to have&nbsp;served G’d as the first piece of solid material of what would&nbsp;be the globe on which we live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצק שמן על ראשה</span><span class="font5">, “he poured some oil on top of it;” he anointed it in order to make it suitable to serve as an altar for&nbsp;sacrifices when he would return from Padan Arom. We know&nbsp;that later on when the Jewish people built a Tabernacle in&nbsp;the desert in Moses’ time, every vessel that was used in that&nbsp;Temple had to be anointed with a special type of oil in order&nbsp;to qualify for such use. (Numbers 7,1) When G’d told Yaakov&nbsp;to return to this site in Genesis 31,13, He made reference to&nbsp;Yaakov having already anointed this stone when he was&nbsp;fleeing from Esau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: he poured oil on this stone as a mark by which to recognise this stone on his return when he&nbsp;would fulfill his vow to make it part of a Temple. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואול</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לוז ש</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">העיר לראשונה</span><span class="font5">, “however, the name of&nbsp;the town was Luz, originally. The town was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font5"> renamed&nbsp;(probably at the time when the Jewish people conquered that&nbsp;region) on account of the important historical figure Yaakov&nbsp;who had spent the night outside it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וידר יעקב נדר</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov made a vow;” if you were&nbsp;to ask that according to the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin,</span><span class="font5"> 2 (based on&nbsp;Kohelet 5,4) that it is better not to make any vows than to&nbsp;make vows and not pay them on time, so why did Yaakov&nbsp;make such a vow? The word: לאמור which follows the quote&nbsp;above was added in the Torah to show that Yaakov, who&nbsp;was in dire circumstances, made the vow due to his&nbsp;desperate situation; we are to learn from this that in such&nbsp;circumstances G’d even </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">welcomes</span><span class="font5"> a vow, as it is proof that&nbsp;the person making it has turned to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font5"> for help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">א</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יהיה אלוקי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עמדי</span><span class="font5">, “if G’d will be with me;” what made him doubt that G’d would be with him? After all he was on an&nbsp;errant for his father to fulfill the commandment to take for&nbsp;himself a suitable wife? Answer: he was afraid that before&nbsp;being able to carry out his mission he might have become&nbsp;guilty of some sin so that he would forfeit that the protection&nbsp;that being on a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mitzvah</span><span class="font5"> errand would normally afford him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators prefer to understand the whole verse as an oath, meaning: “I swear to do this in order that&nbsp;G’d will listen to my prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[The reason for this interpretation, I believe, is that otherwise the conditional word אם, “if” in the vow sounds as if&nbsp;he presented G’d with an ultimatum, that he would&nbsp;acknowledge G’d as his G’d </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> on these conditions first&nbsp;having been met. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,22. והאבן הזאת </span><span class="font5">literally: “and this stone,” but the meaning must be: “I will offer sacrifices and separate tithes&nbsp;on this stone (altar).” The letter ו at the beginning of the word:&nbsp;והאבן, appears superfluous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה ה' לי לאלוקים </span><span class="font5">, “the Lord will act on my behalf as Judge and avenger.” To the question how Yaakov could&nbsp;have intended to make out of a stone which he had used as&nbsp;pillow for himself, i.e. for a mundane use, an altar, seeing&nbsp;that we have a clear ruling in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zevachim,</span><span class="font5"> 116 as&nbsp;well as in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot</span><span class="font5"> 22, that this is inadmissible? The&nbsp;answer presumably is that when the altar is not a public altar&nbsp;but the altar of an individual, the Rabbis were not concerned&nbsp;with this rule. [When the rule was established, private altars&nbsp;had been forbidden for many hundred of years already. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">יהיה בית אלוקים, “will become a house of G’d.” The reference is to the site, not to the actual stone. The word:&nbsp;“will become,” does not refer to the stone. We have a similar&nbsp;example of the use of both masculine and feminine modes&nbsp;for the same noun with the word: ארץ, “land.” Compare&nbsp;Genesis 12,7 and 13,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ארצה בני קדם</span><span class="font5">, “to the land of Aram,” as we know&nbsp;from Isaiah 9,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירא והנה באר בשדה</span><span class="font5">, “when he looked, see there&nbsp;was a well in the field.” This whole paragraph, up to and&nbsp;including the line: “he rolled aside the rock,” (in verse 10) has&nbsp;been recorded only in order to teach us about the physical&nbsp;strength of Yaakov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">רובצים עליה</span><span class="font5">, “were lying upon it;” in expectation of being watered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פי הבאר והאבן גדולה על</span><span class="font5">, “and the rock covering the opening of the well was large;” this was in order to prevent&nbsp;anything falling into the well which would contaminate its&nbsp;water or interfere with its free flow. It was also meant to&nbsp;prevent individual strangers to make use of its water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,5. לבן בן נחור</span><span class="font5">, Lavan’s father Bethuel, was some kind of an outcast, as opposed to his grandfather. This is why the&nbsp;Torah here mentions only Nachor. When Lavan had moved&nbsp;to Charan, his father had already died, and no one there had&nbsp;known him. The local inhabitants welcomed Lavan on&nbsp;account of his well known grandfather Nachor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,7. לא עת האסף המקנה, </span><span class="font5">“it is not yet time to bring the cattle home.” The use of the word: האסף in this context also&nbsp;occurs in Judges 19,18: ואין איש מאסף אותי הביתה, “and no one&nbsp;is willing to give me shelter in his house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">השקו הצאן ולכו ורעו</span><span class="font5">, “water the flock and proceed to let them graze.” Why would a stranger like Yaakov dare to order&nbsp;these shepherds around as if they were his employees? He&nbsp;was afraid that Rachel would join the shepherds, whereas he&nbsp;was interested in having a private conversation with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,9. ורחל באה עם הצאן אשר לאביה כי רועה היא</span><span class="font5">, “and Rachel&nbsp;arrived with the flocks that belonged to her father;” the&nbsp;reason that her older sister did not tend the flocks was that&nbsp;due to her sensitive eyes the air on the field was harmful for&nbsp;her condition. Besides, it was one way of honouring her&nbsp;status as being the older one that she did not have to leave&nbsp;the house to go to work. (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessikta zutrata</span><span class="font5"> she&nbsp;was already of marriageable age.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,12. ויגד יעקב לרחל</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov told Rachel;” He must have identified himself already previously, or he would not&nbsp;have dared kiss her as is reported in verse 11. Now he told&nbsp;her more details about himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אחי אביה הוא</span><span class="font5">, “that he was a brother of her father.” After having told her this, he kissed her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis of this sequence: Yaakov first told Rachel that he was the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">brother</span><span class="font5"> of her father in order that she&nbsp;should not feel insulted that he had been fresh enough to&nbsp;kiss her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותגד לאביה</span><span class="font5">, “she told her father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[This is already the second time that Bethuel is described as alive; I do not understand why our author has&nbsp;claimed that he died before Lavan ever came to Charan, as&nbsp;he did on verse 5. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Rivkah had a similar experience with Eliezer, she is reported as relating her encounter to her mother, as she&nbsp;did not know precisely who Eliezer was. Daughters normally&nbsp;keep their mothers’ company, not their father’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויספר ללבן את כל הדברים האלה</span><span class="font5">, “he told Lavan in&nbsp;detail about all these events;” i.e. how he had acquired the&nbsp;birthright and subsequently the blessing, in order that Lavan&nbsp;would agree to give him Rachel in marriage. He also told him&nbsp;that he had been forced to flee from his brother Esau in order&nbsp;to explain why he had arrived empty-handed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אך עצמי ובשרי אתה</span><span class="font5">, “Lavan said that legally&nbsp;speaking he should not have given Yaakov shelter, just as&nbsp;his other relatives had not protected him and forced him to&nbsp;flee after he had cheated his brother on two separate&nbsp;occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, “seeing that you are my own flesh and blood,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I will make an exception and not kick you out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישב עמו חדש ימים, </span><span class="font5">“he stayed with him for a month.” The Torah uses this opportunity to teach us for how long a person&nbsp;must practice hospitality with his relatives. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">70,14) An alternate exegesis: When Lavan had heard what&nbsp;Yaakov had done to Esau, he was afraid to hire him until he&nbsp;had at least assured himself of his skills and suitability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,18. ויאהב יעקב את רחל, </span><span class="font5">“Yaakov loved Rachel;” he already had set his eyes on her with a view to wedding her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אעבדך</span><span class="font5">, “I will serve you;” the letter ב in this word is vocalised with a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chataph kametz,</span><span class="font5"> an abbreviated vowel&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz.</span><span class="font5"> (Not in our editions of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chumash).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבע שנים, </span><span class="font5">“for seven years.” He should not have offered to serve Lavan for more than a year or maximum two years.&nbsp;Yaakov felt that Lavan would not give him a beautiful girl</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">such as Rachel for a relatively cheap price. He also wanted Rachel to know how highly he prized her as a wife to be. This&nbsp;is why he volunteered seven years of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ברחל בך </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">הקטנה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“for your </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">small</span><span class="font5"> daughter Rachel.” The use of the word: “the small” one, instead of “the younger one,”&nbsp;implied that her father did not think very highly of her. This is&nbsp;why she was assigned the duties of a shepherd. He&nbsp;volunteered to perform the duties that she had been&nbsp;assigned previously by being a shepherdess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: why did he add the word: ברחל. Who did not know that this was her name? Yaakov reasoned&nbsp;that if he were to marry Lavan’s older daughter, Esau would&nbsp;have another complaint against him by claiming that he had&nbsp;not only stolen his birthright, but also the woman designated&nbsp;for him as the firstborn son of Rivkah. [This seems very&nbsp;weak, as the Torah had already told us that Yaakov was in&nbsp;love with Rachel from the moment he met her. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.20. ויהיו בעיניו כימים אחדים</span><span class="font5">, “these seven years went by for him as if they had been only a few days.” Yaakov&nbsp;considered having to work for seven years in order to marry&nbsp;Rachel, as cheap at the price, as if he had paid only the&nbsp;equivalent of a few days’ wages for her. This reflected how&nbsp;much he was in love with her. If Lavan had demanded a&nbsp;higher price, he would also have been willing to pay it. While&nbsp;engaged actively in labouring, however, he felt the opposite&nbsp;way and could not await the time when he would finally be&nbsp;united with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי מלאו ימי</span><span class="font5">, “for my days of labouring (for her)&nbsp;have been completed.” seven full years had passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis of this line: he hinted that the time had come for him to start his family seeing that he was&nbsp;already 84 years old, and was approaching old age. Use of&nbsp;the term in that sense is found also in Jeremiah 6,11, i.e. זקן&nbsp;ומלא ימים.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,24. את זלפה שפחתו, </span><span class="font5">“his servant-maid Zilpah;” how could the Torah describe them as servant-maids when they&nbsp;were actually Lavan’s daughters? (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit rabbah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">74,13) We must therefore assume that the Torah used the&nbsp;terminology of the people at that time who described their&nbsp;daughters born by concubines as their servant-maids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,25. ויהי בבקר והנה היא לאה</span><span class="font5">, “and when it was morning Yaakov found out that the woman in bed with him had been&nbsp;Leah;” this verse teaches us a great deal about how chaste a&nbsp;person Yaakov was, and that he had hardly exchanged any&nbsp;words with who he thought was his wife while having marital&nbsp;relations with her. Had he been speaking with her, surely he&nbsp;would have known from her voice that he had been&nbsp;deceived. After all, he had lived in her proximity for the last&nbsp;seven years, and she was no stranger to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask that seeing that the so called marriage ceremony was clearly invalid, as the woman under&nbsp;the wedding canopy had not been the one with whom he&nbsp;thought that he had exchanged sacred vows, we would have&nbsp;to answer that as soon as he found this out he had relations&nbsp;with her for the purpose of legalising their marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתנה לך גם את זאת, “</span><span class="font5">we will give you this one&nbsp;also;” the plural mode used here shows that Yaakov had not&nbsp;believed that Lavan would not try to trick him and had&nbsp;confirmed his betrothal already then in the presence of and&nbsp;with the consent of the local population. The entire&nbsp;population of Padan Arom had been a party to this deception&nbsp;from the start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וימן לו את רחל</span><span class="font5">, “he gave him Rachel;” if you were&nbsp;to ask how Yaakov could legally have lived with two sisters,&nbsp;while both were alive, something forbidden by Jewish law,&nbsp;and according to tradition he kept the entire Torah laws, our&nbsp;sages have said that when a pagan undergoes conversion,&nbsp;all previous family relationships are retroactively cancelled&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> 22), so that as soon as Leah became Yaakov’s&nbsp;wife, Rachel automatically had ceased to be her sister. A&nbsp;convert is considered as if a newly born person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: Leah and Rachel had been halfsisters sharing only their father. In Jewish law these family ties are dependent on the mother, not the father. Proof of this&nbsp;can be found in Deuteronomy 7,4; from here it is clear that&nbsp;the word בנך, “your son,” is a term that applies only to a son&nbsp;born by a Jewish mother, otherwise he would have been&nbsp;referred to as “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">her</span><span class="font5"> son.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,30. ויאהב גם את רחל מלאה</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov also loved Rachel more than (he loved) Leah.” What is the meaning of the word&nbsp;גם, “also,” in this verse? Normally a man’s first wife occupies&nbsp;a permanent place in his heart, more so than any&nbsp;subsequent wives he will take due to circumstances beyond&nbsp;his control. The Torah tells us that whenever Yaakov spent&nbsp;time with Rachel, he enjoyed that “quality time,” more than&nbsp;when he spent time with Leah. This was so although his first&nbsp;experience of marital intimacy had been with Leah. This is&nbsp;hinted at by the word גם.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ילוה אישי אלי</span><span class="font5">, “my husband will be more firmly&nbsp;connected to me.” She meant that up until now she would&nbsp;take her two children one with each hand, and did not need&nbsp;to call on her husband’s support. Now she needed to call on&nbsp;his support as she could not take three children by her two&nbsp;hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על כן קרא שמו לוי</span><span class="font5">, “this is why he named him Levi, companion. [All the other eleven children of Yaakov were&nbsp;named by their mothers, Yaakov, adding a second name to&nbsp;the youngest whom Rachel had named </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ben Oni.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.] There&nbsp;is some debate about the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zevulun;</span><span class="font5"> (30,20) some&nbsp;commentators assume that Yaakov did not agree with Leah’s&nbsp;implying that he would now make his permanent residence in&nbsp;Leah’s tent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותעמד מלדת</span><span class="font5">, “she was (temporarily) unable to&nbsp;conceive and give birth again. Seeing that several years later&nbsp;Leah did give birth to Dinah, the Torah chose a word (עמידה,&nbsp;temporary standing still) which indicated that her inability to&nbsp;give birth for a while was not due to her having become too&nbsp;old. She was not able to conceive and give birth again until&nbsp;after Asher had been born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,1. ותקנא רחל באחותה</span><span class="font5">, “Rachel became jealous of her sister;” she had not become jealous until after Leah had&nbsp;given birth to her fourth son. The reason was that by doing&nbsp;so she had received more than her “fair” share of the 12 sons&nbsp;Yaakov was supposed to sire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,4. את בלהה שפחתה לאשה</span><span class="font5">, “her servant-maid Bilhah as wife.” This was similar to what Leah had received from her&nbsp;father when she had married. She also gave that servant&nbsp;maid to her husband Yaakov, as reported in 30,9. We know&nbsp;that Joseph in his early years kept company with the sons of&nbsp;Bilhah and Zilpah who are described there as his father’s&nbsp;“wives.” (Genesis 37,2) This teaches that these women were&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font5"> concubines, but regular wives with all the financial&nbsp;security that such a status guarantees the wife. None of the&nbsp;12 “tribes” were born to women who were merely&nbsp;concubines. The only time when the expression “concubine”&nbsp;is used about them is when they are mentioned in&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">comparison</span><span class="font5"> to Rachel and Leah, when the indiscretion of&nbsp;Reuven is alluded to by the Torah in both Genesis 35,22,&nbsp;and 49,4. Gad and Asher had already been born when that&nbsp;indiscretion took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,6. דנני, “</span><span class="font5">He has judged me;” she acknowledges that she had been appropriately punished for having been jealous&nbsp;of her sister. Nonetheless she had also then been rewarded.&nbsp;(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 71,7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,8. נפתלתי עם אחותי</span><span class="font5">, “I have struggled mightily with my sister;” first she had been judged by the attribute of Justice of&nbsp;G’d; as a result of realising her error, she had now become&nbsp;closer to her sister. This is reflected in history. Though&nbsp;Betzalel, from the tribe of Yehudah (son of Leah) became the&nbsp;primary architect of the Tabernacle in the desert, his second&nbsp;in command was Oholiov, from the tribe of Dan, i.e. from&nbsp;Rachel’s servant maid. She felt that in a measure she had&nbsp;also prevailed over her sister in her rivalry, as the permanent&nbsp;Temple in Solomon’s time would be constructed by a&nbsp;descendant of Naftali, from her family. (Compare Kings I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">7,13-14: וישלח המלך שלמה ויקח את תירם בן אשה אלמנה הוא ממטה נפתלי, “King Solomon sent for Chirom and brought him down&nbsp;from Tyre. He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naftali,&nbsp;and his father had been a Tyrian, a coppersmith. He was&nbsp;endowed with skill, ability, and talent, for executing all work&nbsp;on bronze.” He came to King Solomon and executed all his&nbsp;work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,11. ותאמר לאה בגד</span><span class="font5">, Leah said: “he betrayed,” i.e. this son is the result of my husband’s betrayal. [based on the&nbsp;word בגידה, “treachery. Ed.] Leah felt that although she had&nbsp;given Yaakov her servant maid to sleep with, he should not&nbsp;have accepted that offer. Did I not bear him four sons&nbsp;already? While it is true that he slept with Rachel’s servant&nbsp;maid also, this was understandable, as she had not born him&nbsp;any children. She called the son גד. [If I understand our&nbsp;author correctly, Leah was happy to be the “mother” of&nbsp;another son, but unhappy about </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">how</span><span class="font5"> she had to come by&nbsp;him, i.e. vicariously. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">She called the second son her servant maid had born, אשר, i.e. source of happiness, as by now she had reconciled&nbsp;herself to have given Yaakov her maidservant (This&nbsp;interpretation is close to the one offered in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">midrash&nbsp;hagadol)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word: בגד, which is spelled as a single word instead of as two words: i.e. בא גד, but is read as one word. If we read&nbsp;this word as two words, the meaning is: בא גד, “a troop&nbsp;arrived,” i.e. my four sons have now been joined by another&nbsp;one that forms part of my little army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וימצא דודאים</span><span class="font5">, “he found figs.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;המעט קחתך את אישי</span><span class="font5">, “not only have you usurped&nbsp;my position as the senior wife, seeing that I was married to&nbsp;him first, but...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישכב עמה בלילה הוא</span><span class="font5">, “he slept with her on that&nbsp;night.” [In order to be grammatically correct, the Torah should&nbsp;have written: בלילה ההוא. Our author points out that this is not&nbsp;a scribe’s error, but that we have a similar formulation in&nbsp;Genesis 32,23: ויקם לילה הוא, “he got up during that night,”&nbsp;where we also would have expected to find: בלילה ההוא.&nbsp;[Perhaps the missing letter is to indicate that in both&nbsp;instances Yaakov made the decision hastily. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,18. נתן אלוקים שכרי אשר נתתי שפחתי לאישי</span><span class="font5">, “G’d gave&nbsp;me my reward for having given my maidservant to my&nbsp;husband.” She acknowledged G’d’s generosity, by having&nbsp;realised that if her sister had become a mother only&nbsp;vicariously by having given her servant maid to her husband,&nbsp;she had had good reason, as she had failed to personally&nbsp;provide him with children, and this was excusable; she, Leah&nbsp;having done so also was probably inexcusable; if&nbsp;nonetheless G’d had blessed her with having two more sons&nbsp;to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">raise</span><span class="font5">, she considered this as a reward for her generosity in&nbsp;offering Yaakov her servant maid as a wife. In light of these&nbsp;considerations she named this son יששכר, “he who will be the&nbsp;symbol of a reward.” The name is written with two letters ש to&nbsp;draw our attention to what she meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יזבלני אישי</span><span class="font5">, “my husband will make a home with&nbsp;me.” The word is a composition of two words. Examples of&nbsp;similar constructions are found in Jeremiah 10,20: my sons&nbsp;will leave me; as well as in Genesis 49,19 גדוד יגודני, “troops&nbsp;will be called up from the tribe of Gad.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואחר ילדה בת</span><span class="font5">, “afterwards she gave birth to a&nbsp;daughter.” This is the only time that the mother has not first&nbsp;been described as becoming pregnant. Our author uses this&nbsp;as proof at Dinah was a twin sister of Zevulun. (This&nbsp;interpretation is quoted also by Ibn Ezra, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor,</span><span class="font5"> and&nbsp;David Kimchi.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the reason why no mention has been made of a pregnancy here is that originally, this child&nbsp;was supposed to be another male. Leah prayed that it would&nbsp;become a female, as otherwise-seeing that Yaakov was&nbsp;destined to sire 12 sons,-Rachel could not have given birth to&nbsp;two sons. The fetus which would have been Joseph thus&nbsp;became Dinah. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> whose source is an opinion&nbsp;in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot</span><span class="font5">,60 a well as the Targum Yonathan&nbsp;ben Uzziel [older than the Talmud. Ed.])</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויזכור אלוקים את רחל</span><span class="font5">, G’d -attribute of Justice-remembered Rachel. Blessed the righteous who posses the&nbsp;power to turn the attribute of Justice into the attribute of&nbsp;Mercy. (Based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 72,3 which adds that&nbsp;whenever the expression אלוקים is used in the Torah it refers&nbsp;to G’d’s attribute of Justice)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,23. אסף אלוקים את חרפתי</span><span class="font5">, “G’d has removed my shame.” Rachel referred to her becoming the victim of the&nbsp;same penalty as people guilty of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">karet,</span><span class="font5"> leaving behind no&nbsp;biological issue. The expression אסף occurs in a similar&nbsp;context in Isaiah 16,10: נאספה שמחה וגיל, “rejoicing and&nbsp;gladness are gone;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,25. ויהי כאשר רחל ילדה יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “it occurred as soon as Rachel had born Joseph,” i.e. when Yaakov’s second term of&nbsp;indenture to Lavan had been completed; now all the 12 sons&nbsp;that were to become the twelve tribes of Israel had been&nbsp;born. [according to Ibn Ezra, who considers Dinah as one of&nbsp;those 12. Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rachel’s giving birth completed this circle, she who had been described as barren in 29,31 finally having overcome&nbsp;her handicap. Yaakov therefore now approached Lavan by&nbsp;announcing that he planned to go home to his parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the words “ויאמר שלחני,” Yaakov had not asked Lavan for permission to leave&nbsp;previously because he was afraid that as long as Rachel was&nbsp;still barren, Lavan would suspect him of treating her with&nbsp;disdain on account of this. Now that she too had born him a&nbsp;son, he felt confident that Lavan would permit him to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have found the following text in the book called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seder olam:</span><span class="font5"> “eleven of the tribes, plus Dinah were born&nbsp;during the seven years of Yaakov serving his second term of&nbsp;seven years. Each one of these was born after a pregnancy&nbsp;of only seven months by his respective mother. The 84&nbsp;months of these seven years are made up of the mothers&nbsp;being actively pregnant for six months each, and allowing for&nbsp;one week of ritual impurity separating each birth from the&nbsp;next.” [Clearly this is a mystic approach which saw in these&nbsp;84 months a single preordained sequence, and the mothers&nbsp;all being perceived as if they were only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">one</span><span class="font5"> mother. Ed.] The&nbsp;text in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seder olam</span><span class="font5"> interprets a statement in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh&nbsp;hashanah</span><span class="font5"> 11 in this sense. [The Talmud there discusses the&nbsp;viability of a fetus that was born after less than 36 weeks’&nbsp;pregnancy. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נחשתי</span><span class="font5">, “I have learned by divination;” Lavan&nbsp;owned household idols. Seeing that this was so, he&nbsp;consulted with sorcerers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">נחשתי ויברכני, “I consulted with them and have found that I have been blessed since your having come to me.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explains this as follows: until you came here I have only had&nbsp;daughters. This is why he had to send out his daughters to&nbsp;tend his flocks. Surely, if he had had sons he would not have&nbsp;sent out daughters to tend the flocks. One could understand&nbsp;the line: כי רועה היא in 29,9 to mean: “instead of them;” the&nbsp;boys. Maybe his sons were too young to be sent out tending&nbsp;sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר נקבה שכרך</span><span class="font5">, “he said: tell me what you wish to&nbsp;receive as compensation for tending my flocks?” This line&nbsp;refers to when Lavan had told Yaakov that he realised that&nbsp;Yaakov’s presence had been especially beneficial for him.&nbsp;He was interested in keeping Yaakov near him as he had&nbsp;been such a source of blessing for him. The repetition of the&nbsp;word ויאמר in two successive verses is not especially&nbsp;unusual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את אשר עבדתיך, </span><span class="font5">“I have served you for the hand of&nbsp;a woman in marriage, not for “wages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.31. ?ויאמר מה אתן לך</span><span class="font5">, He said: “what shall I give you for&nbsp;the work you have performed for me?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמר יעקב לא תתן לי מאומה</span><span class="font5">, Yaakov said: “you do not have to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">give</span><span class="font5"> me anything;” he referred to the last seven&nbsp;years; he had worked for the hand of Rachel in marriage.&nbsp;She was his now. However, he added, “if you wish me to&nbsp;stay with you longer and to continue to look after your flocks,&nbsp;do the following for me and I will agree and continue to tend&nbsp;your flocks;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל שה נקוד וטלוא, “</span><span class="font5">every lamb whose skin pattern&nbsp;is characterised by being either dappled or blotched, etc., he&nbsp;referred not to fully grown animals but to the ones under one&nbsp;year old. Neither did he single out the animals whose skin&nbsp;had a pattern known as עקודים; any animals that would be&nbsp;borne henceforth and whose skin reflected the patterns&nbsp;described by Yaakov would be his. Lavan commenced&nbsp;immediately with his treachery by removing any animals&nbsp;which according to accepted standards were likely to either&nbsp;sire or give birth to young ones having the skin patterns that&nbsp;Yaakov had stipulated as becoming his. This treachery&nbsp;forced Yaakov to devise a different means to encourage the&nbsp;remaining animals under his care to produce some young&nbsp;that reflected the skin patterns he had chosen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חום בכבשים</span><span class="font5">, brown skin patterns among the sheep; this is emphasised as he did not do so with the goats, as the&nbsp;majority of them displayed such brown skin blotches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,33. וענתה בי צדקתי</span><span class="font5">, an abbreviated verse; the meaning is: “my truthfulness will be demonstrated on the&nbsp;following day i.e. in the future, (when these animals will&nbsp;produce young) when you have a chance to check on what I&nbsp;have selected as the basis for my wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום, </span><span class="font5">the letter ב does not have the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach,</span><span class="font5"> as Yaakov cannot predict the exact day when this will be proven&nbsp;several months later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,37. מקל</span><span class="font5">, “rod;” the letter ק has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">under it (instead of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzeyreh).</span><span class="font5"> This is not unusual for the&nbsp;construct mode; we find it also in the word מעשר, Leviticus&nbsp;27,32, as well as in the word מספד in Jeremiah 6,26 which&nbsp;has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach</span><span class="font5"> under the letter .פ</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לבנה לח, “</span><span class="font5">moist aspen wood;” the wood of this tree is white only when exposed after peeling the bark and still&nbsp;moist. This distinguishes it from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">luz</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">armon</span><span class="font5"> trees the&nbsp;wood of which are white regardless of moist or dry. This is&nbsp;why they are described as לבנה, “white.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולוז, </span><span class="font5">and almond trees. We know this from the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bechorot 8,</span><span class="font5"> where the time needed for a hen to lay an egg&nbsp;after copulating is given as 21 days, identical to the&nbsp;development of the almond in the almond tree after&nbsp;pollination. It is not to be confused with the hazelnut tree&nbsp;which produces small nuts, and which requires more than 21&nbsp;days between pollination and blossoming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויפצל</span><span class="font5">, “he peeled;” this word does not appear elsewhere in the Bible. In the Talmud it means to split something into&nbsp;separate parts by peeling or skimming. Examples are&nbsp;enclosures where female sheep or goats are prevented from&nbsp;escaping so that the males introduced will copulate promptly&nbsp;and impregnate them. This is the meaning of the phrase: והיו&nbsp;הקשורים ליעקב, “and the ones that had been tied up would&nbsp;belong to Yaakov.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,38. ויחמנה</span><span class="font5">, “they grew heated;” the construction of&nbsp;this word is a combination of two conjugations. It is similar in&nbsp;this respect to Samuel I 6,12: וישרנה הפרות, “the cows went&nbsp;straight, and to ארבע מלכיות מגוי יעמודנה, “four kingdoms will&nbsp;arise out of a nation,” and in Daniel 8,2, and in ותקרבו העצמות&nbsp;עצם אל עצם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">the bones came together,” in Ezekiel 37,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויחמו הצאן</span><span class="font5">, “the flocks grew heated;” the Torah&nbsp;did not mind in this case to use the singular mode when&nbsp;speaking of numerous animals; we know of other examples&nbsp;of a similar construction such as Judges 21,21: אם יצאו בנות&nbsp;שילה, “as soon as the daughters of Shiloh will come forth,”&nbsp;where the masculine mode is applied to the girls of Shiloh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל המקלות</span><span class="font5">, “in response to the sticks;” the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל </span><span class="font5">does not mean to approach physically;” similar to Genesis 41,57:&nbsp;לשבור אל יוסף, “to buy grain from Joseph,” where it also has&nbsp;not been used in a physical sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation: “on account of the sticks.” This would be similar to Yaakov saying in Genesis 37,35: כי ארד אל&nbsp;בני שאולה, “for I will join my son on the way down to hades” (a&nbsp;grave in the nether regions of the earth).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותלדנה הצאן עקודים</span><span class="font5">, “the flocks gave birth to young with striped birth patterns on the skins of their feet.” From then on&nbsp;Yaakov did not again bother to erect the sticks near the&nbsp;troughs, but he simply separated the animals that had&nbsp;displayed the skin patterns in accordance with his agreement&nbsp;Lavan from the brown-skinned ones that were Lavan’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.40. ולא שתם על צאו לבן, </span><span class="font5">and he did not keep them near the flocks that belonged to Lavan. He did not want&nbsp;Lavan to be able to say that he had mixed them among&nbsp;Lavan’s flocks in order that Lavan’s sheep would produce&nbsp;young looking like those of Yaakov. The construction: על צאן&nbsp;לבן, must be understood as similar to Leviticus 25,31: על שדה&nbsp;הארץ יחשב, “shall be considered as open country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר ה' אל יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord said to Yaakov;” what&nbsp;follows is the dream that he told his wives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרא לרחל וללאה, </span><span class="font5">“he sent word to Rachel and&nbsp;Leah to come to him;” the Torah mentions the names of&nbsp;these wives by name as they were the senior wives; he did&nbsp;not have to send messages to Zilpah and Bilhah and their&nbsp;respective children as they were in his proximity all the time,&nbsp;helping him tend the flocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.9. את מקנה אביכם</span><span class="font5">, “the herds of your father.” The masculine ending ם is used although according to the rules of&nbsp;grammar the feminine ending should have been used</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וברודים</span><span class="font5">, speckled, some of the animals he saw in&nbsp;the dream showed such skin patterns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,15. את כספנו</span><span class="font5">, “our money;” they told Yaakov that their&nbsp;father had withheld the money that had rightfully been theirs&nbsp;as their dowry, -even though he had paid this in the form of&nbsp;physical labour as a shepherd. This would have been no&nbsp;more than common decency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,19. ותגנוב רחל את התרפים</span><span class="font5">, “Rachel stole the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">teraphim;” </span><span class="font5">in order that Lavan would not be able to divine the route they&nbsp;had taken by consulting them as oracles. We have read&nbsp;about their uses in Hoseah 3,4 as well as in Zachariah 10,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,22. וירדוף אחריו</span><span class="font5">, “he chased after him. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the distance that Yaakov with all his sheep and cattle&nbsp;had covered in seven days, Lavan, riding, had been able to&nbsp;cover in a single day. Yaakov had taken seven days to get&nbsp;from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Padan Arom</span><span class="font5"> to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Har Gilead.</span><span class="font5"> Different commentators&nbsp;disagree on how long it took Yaakov. Considering that we&nbsp;have been told in Genesis 30,36, that he had put three days&nbsp;walk between himself and Lavan, he had only travelled for 4&nbsp;days before Lavan caught up with him. At any rate Lavan’s&nbsp;catching up with Yaakov is not surprising due to his riding&nbsp;either on camels or donkeys, and not being slowed down by&nbsp;animals and other heavy luggage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,24. ויבא אלוקים אל לבן</span><span class="font5">, G’d came (in a dream) to Lavan;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לנשק לבני ולבנותי</span><span class="font5">, “to provide my sons and&nbsp;daughters with parting gifts;” although the word נשק appears&nbsp;primarily as meaning “to kiss,” it is also the same word (as a&nbsp;noun) meaning </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">neshek,</span><span class="font5"> “weapons,” in the sense of the&nbsp;equipment needed for survival, as we know from Psalms&nbsp;2,12: נשקו בר, “gird yourselves;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יש לאל ידי לעשות עמכם רע</span><span class="font5">, “it is within my power to&nbsp;harm you;” Lavan implies that even G’d is aware of this and&nbsp;is afraid that I will take my revenge of you, and that it why He&nbsp;has warned me concerning you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,33. ויבא באהל רחל </span><span class="font5">“he came into the tent of Rachel;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on these words (basing himself on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">74,12) says that Lavan now went back to the tent of Rachel&nbsp;once more after having already searched the tent of Leah,&nbsp;before proceeding to the tents of the other matriarchs,&nbsp;because he considered her a thief. What is the reason that&nbsp;prompted </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> to accept this interpretation, i.e. that Lavan&nbsp;searched the tents of the matriarchs last? I believe it is based&nbsp;on the words: ולא מצא “and he had not found” in our verse,&nbsp;after having told us that he searched the tents of Yaakov and&nbsp;the matriarchs. Clearly this had to refer to the tents of the&nbsp;matriarchs which would have been the logical starting point&nbsp;for the search. On the one hand, seeing that Rachel was&nbsp;Yaakov’s favourite wife and he spent most of his time with&nbsp;her, the reference to the tent of Yaakov could be understood&nbsp;as including searching Rachel’s belongings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rachel’s personal tent, -presumably used by her only while experiencing her menses, and therefore ritually&nbsp;impure,- was located in the centre of the whole camp. The&nbsp;entrances of the tents of the matriarchs opened to public&nbsp;paths on the one side and to Rachel’s tent on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators argue that we must follow the sequence of the text, i.e. that Leah’s tent was in the centre&nbsp;Rachel’s tent adjoining, and the other two matriarchs’ tents&nbsp;adjoining that of Rachel. Only Leah’s and Rachel’s tents also&nbsp;had an entrance facing a public path, so that Yaakov could&nbsp;not go out to the public domain without the knowledge of&nbsp;either Rachel or Leah. Lavan was therefore forced to return&nbsp;to the tent of Leah, and subsequently to that of Rachel.&nbsp;[Lavan searched in the order of who he thought had most to&nbsp;gain by stealing his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">teraphim,</span><span class="font5"> commencing with Yaakov. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,34. ורחל לקחה את התרפים</span><span class="font5">, “and Rachel had taken the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">teraphim;</span><span class="font5"> when Lavan left the tent of Leah went and placed&nbsp;them under her cushion while seated on the camel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,38. לא שכלו</span><span class="font5">, “did not miscarry;” it is customary for shepherds to occasionally beat one or another of the animals&nbsp;entrusted to him in order to force them to walk in line with the&nbsp;other beasts. This could result in a miscarriage of a pregnant&nbsp;animal. Yaakov prides himself never to have beaten any of&nbsp;these animals, and that is how he explains that in twenty&nbsp;years under his care none ever miscarried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואילי צאנך</span><span class="font5">, “and the ewes among your flocks,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">here (based </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">on Baba</span><span class="font5"> Kamma, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">65</span><span class="font5"> explains that we learn from&nbsp;this line that even a ewe only one day old, is already called&nbsp;“ewe” and not “sheep” or “lamb”. If </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> were not correct,&nbsp;what point would Yaakov be making by claiming never to&nbsp;have eaten any of the flock entrusted to him? He could have&nbsp;eaten them while they bore a different name, such as&nbsp;mentioned! If you were to counter that we know from&nbsp;experience that the name “ewe” is not applied to male sheep&nbsp;until they have reached the age of two years and someone&nbsp;obligated to bring a sacrificial animal called “ewe” must bring&nbsp;one not younger that two years old, [and are therefore&nbsp;capable of copulating? Ed.] the answer is that, of course, the&nbsp;name “ewe” is applied to even one day old male sheep, it is&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">only </span><span class="font5">for the purpose of serving as a sacrificial animal that&nbsp;such a ewe must be at least two years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואילי צאנך לא אכלתי</span><span class="font5">, “neither have I eaten from the ewes of your flocks.” It is the custom of shepherds to look after the&nbsp;flock by day and to bring the flock home at night to the&nbsp;owner; if during the night one or more of the sheep have&nbsp;been stolen, the loss is that of the owner. You, however,&nbsp;have demanded compensation from me even for sheep that&nbsp;disappeared while in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> possession and inside your pens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,39. טרפה לא הבאתי אליך</span><span class="font5">, “I did not bring you the remains of animals that had been torn by wild beasts; even if&nbsp;I was completely powerless to prevent such incidences I did&nbsp;not expect it to become your loss; neither did I expect you to&nbsp;compensate me for animals stolen by day or night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.41. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושש שנים בצאנך</span><span class="font5">, “and six years for “your” flocks.&nbsp;Under the same terms as those set forth in the Torah for a&nbsp;Jewish servant who has been indentured for a fixed period.&nbsp;(Exodus chapter 21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותחלף</span><span class="font5">, “you have repeatedly changed the terms during the currency of that term.” The vowel under the letter ל is a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzeyreh</span><span class="font5"> instead of the expected </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.42. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ופחד יצחק</span><span class="font5">, Yaakov claims that if Lavan had not&nbsp;shown a degree of fear of the retaliation by Yitzchok his&nbsp;father who is wealthy and locally mighty, (in addition to the&nbsp;fear of Yaakov’s, Yitzchok’s and his own G’d)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">היה לי</span><span class="font5">, “Who had repeatedly be on my side by making you scared;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: “if my father Yitzchok who revered and feared G’d, had not assisted me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> states here that Yaakov was afraid to refer to G’d as Yitzchok’s G’d, as we have a rule that G’d does not&nbsp;associate His sacred name with a person still alive, as there&nbsp;is no guarantee that he may not become a heretic. [If we find&nbsp;that G’d made an exception in the case of Yitzchok, as He&nbsp;said to Yaakov in the dream of the ladder, this was because&nbsp;Yitzchok was blind and housebound and therefore not&nbsp;subject to temptation by the evil urge; at this point Yaakov&nbsp;was not yet sure that the dream had not only been just his&nbsp;wishful thinking or a revelation to him by G’d. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do find that Eliezer used the name of the Lord in connection with His being the G’d of Avraham four times, but&nbsp;that was only the Torah reporting it, no proof that G’d&nbsp;approved of his doing so. Alternately, seeing that Avraham&nbsp;had already passed 10 tests of his faith by G’d, Eliezer was&nbsp;on solid ground when he presumed it was in order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי עתה ריקם שלחתני</span><span class="font5">, “you would now have sent me away empty-handed.” You simply would not have compensated me&nbsp;for the last six years that I worked for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,43. ?ולבנותי מה אעשה</span><span class="font5">, “Lavan is beginning to become more conciliatory by saying that he could not bring himself to&nbsp;harm his daughters [all four matriarchs were his daughters,&nbsp;though not from the same mother. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,50. אם תענה את בנותי</span><span class="font5">, “if you were to maltreat my daughters;” Lavan refers to the possibility of Yaakov forcing&nbsp;marital intercourse on his daughters against their will. If he&nbsp;were to argue that in the event of their refusing him he would&nbsp;marry additional wives, he would consider this as if his&nbsp;daughters had been denied their legitimate entitlement to&nbsp;their marital rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אין איש עמנו</span><span class="font5">, even though this understanding is private, not having been confirmed by witnesses, he calls upon G’d&nbsp;as his witness it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.52. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם אני לא אעבור עליך</span><span class="font5">, “I will not cross this stone-pile with hostile intent against you. Lavan undertakes not to&nbsp;join anyone bent on attacking Yaakov in return for Yaakov’s&nbsp;promise not to do this in the event that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">will be attacked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.53. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ישפטו בינינו</span><span class="font5">, “will judge between us;” who of us is&nbsp;at fault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלוקי אביהם, “</span><span class="font5">the gods of their father.” The word for deity in this verse may be understood as sacred when referring to&nbsp;Yaakov’s deity, or secular when referring to Lavan’s deities.&nbsp;(based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 74,14.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישבע יעקב בפחד אביו</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov swore by his father’s G’d; Yaakov was unwilling to refer to his G’d </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">after </span><span class="font5">Lavan had&nbsp;already mentioned his own deities as part of the same&nbsp;reciprocal oath, as he would have considered it as&nbsp;blasphemy; this is why he used a pseudonym, i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pachad,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">when referring to his father’s G’d. We find numerous&nbsp;examples of such </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kinnuyim,</span><span class="font5"> pseudonyms, being used in the&nbsp;Talmud when the sages wanted to avoid having to profane&nbsp;the holy name of G’d by using it unnecessarily. Onkelos also&nbsp;renders it literally, to avoid using the name of G’d when&nbsp;Yaakov had made a strenuous effort to avoid same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: he wished to remind Lavan of the fright that had overcome Yitzchok when he had become&nbsp;aware that but for the intervention of Rivkah and himself he&nbsp;had almost bestowed the power to bless on wicked Esau,&nbsp;and thus become guilty of risking losing his share in the&nbsp;world to come. (27,33)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,3. מחנים</span><span class="font5">, “camps;” a reference to two camps of angels meeting at this place; the ones who had protected&nbsp;him thus far, and the ones assigned to so while he would be&nbsp;in the Holy Land.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Vayishlach</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישלח יעקב מלאכים</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov sent out messengers;”&nbsp;the meaning of the word: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">malachim</span><span class="font5"> here is, as understood by&nbsp;both translators into Aramaic, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">izgedin,</span><span class="font5"> runners, messengers;&nbsp;[human beings. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארצה שעיר, </span><span class="font5">“towards the land of Se-ir.” This land had originally belonged to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Se-ir,”</span><span class="font5"> but when Esau married&nbsp;Oholivamah, daughter of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ana,</span><span class="font5"> he inherited this land courtesy&nbsp;of his wife whose maternal links had been </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ana,</span><span class="font5"> a daughter of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tzivon</span><span class="font5"> as stated in Genesis 36,2. Esau had moved there&nbsp;from the land of Canaan to spend more time with his wives to&nbsp;whom he felt greatly attached. Eventually this land was&nbsp;named after him, i.e. “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">field</span><span class="font5"> of Edom.” This term reminds&nbsp;everyone of Esau’s primary vocation as hunter in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לאדני, לעשו</span><span class="font5">, “to my lord, to Esau.” We find Yaakov&nbsp;addressing Esau as “my lord,” no fewer than eight times in&nbsp;this portion. This may be the reason why eight kings ruled in&nbsp;the land of Edom before the first king ruled in the land of&nbsp;Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כה אמר עבדך יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “thus has said your obedient servant Yaakov;” Yaakov used this subservient posture in order to&nbsp;cool Esau’s burning anger at what he perceived that Yaakov&nbsp;had done to him. He hinted broadly that his father’s blessing&nbsp;which had portrayed Esau as subservient to him had not&nbsp;been fulfilled at all. In fact, he, Yaakov, was quite ready to&nbsp;recognise his older brother as also his senior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עם לבן גרתי</span><span class="font5">, he explains that he had learned to adopt such a wealth of animals and servants this was due to my&nbsp;having stayed with my uncle many years. If he had stayed in&nbsp;someone else’s house during all these years he would still be&nbsp;penniless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of the line: “I have sojourned with Lavan; ”you are aware that I stayed with Lavan as my&nbsp;father and mother have commanded me.” He said this in&nbsp;order to underline that Esau should not flatter himself that he&nbsp;had been a fugitive from Esau’s wrath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third alternate exegesis of these words: Esau should not be cross that he had not come sooner to pay his respects&nbsp;to him; the only reason for this was that he had been&nbsp;indentured to Lavan under contract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;למצוא חן בעיניך, </span><span class="font5">in order to find favour in your eyes.”&nbsp;Yaakov wants a reconciliation with his brother, and in order&nbsp;to achieve this he is willing to be completely transparent with&nbsp;Esau concerning all that he owns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וגם הולך לקראתך</span><span class="font5">, “he is also coming toward you&nbsp;happy to welcome you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וארבע מאות איש עמו</span><span class="font5">, “he took them along in order to honour you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויירא יעקב מאד </span><span class="font5">(upon hearing this) “Yaakov was&nbsp;very much afraid;” you may well ask that after Yaakov had&nbsp;been met by angels, as we read at the end of the last portion,&nbsp;and these angels were clearly meant to protect him, what did&nbsp;he have to worry about? This obvious question is answered&nbsp;by our sages by explaining that one of these angels was&nbsp;Michael, Yaakov’s protective angel, whereas the second one&nbsp;was Samael, Esau’s angel. Knowing this, Yaakov had no&nbsp;way of knowing which of these two angels was more&nbsp;powerful. This is why he became very fearful. Yaakov feared&nbsp;that although he had sent a conciliatory message to Esau, he&nbsp;was afraid that through some inadvertent sin he might have&nbsp;committed recently, he might fall victim to his older brother.&nbsp;He was especially conscious of the fact that he had&nbsp;overstayed his time at Lavan for six years in order to amass&nbsp;some money, instead of returning to the land of Canaan and&nbsp;fulfilling the commandment of honouring his father and&nbsp;mother, especially so, seeing that his father was blind.&nbsp;(Based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 76,2) He therefore did not credit&nbsp;Esau with having friendly intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis about the words: באנו אל אחיך, ”we have come to your brother;” (but he did not respond with a&nbsp;single word). He only said that he would proceed to meet&nbsp;Yaakov; he did not have to come to him, and the&nbsp;messengers returning added that Esau was accompanied by&nbsp;four hundred men. Esau did say that he would speak with&nbsp;Yaakov personally. Yaakov’s fear resulted from the fact that&nbsp;now he was no wiser than before. He had no clue as to&nbsp;Esau’s real intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצר לו</span><span class="font5">, “he was anxious;” the letter י has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzeyreh</span><span class="font5"> underneath it;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחץ את העם אשר אתו</span><span class="font5">, “he split up the entourage that was with him;” Yaakov had said to himself: “if Esau should see&nbsp;me fleeing, (instead) I will awaken feelings of hatred within&nbsp;him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל המחנה האחת</span><span class="font5">, “to one of the camps;” some&nbsp;commentators understand the word האחת here, as a&nbsp;reference to the camp containing the matriarchs and their&nbsp;children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה המחנה הנשאר לפלטה</span><span class="font5">, “this will afford the people in the remaining camp to escape.” [Presumably Esau will not be&nbsp;aware that there are two camps, so that he will not bother to&nbsp;search for it. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of Yaakov’s strategy: while Esau will battle with the people making up the first camp,&nbsp;there will be time enough for the people making up the&nbsp;second camp to flee and escape destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov said (in his prayer to G’d);&nbsp;according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on verse 10, in 31,42 Yaakov avoided&nbsp;referring to his father’s G’d by His name in connection with&nbsp;Him, but had used a euphemism, i.e. פחד יצחק, whereas now&nbsp;he speaks of אלוקי אבי יצחק, without using any euphemism.&nbsp;He answers that Yaakov here refers to the promise of G’d in&nbsp;his dream with the ladder, in which he </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">quotes</span><span class="font5"> G’d as having&nbsp;described Himself as the אלוקי יצחק, “the G’d of Yitzchok.” In&nbsp;31,3, G’d had asked him to return to the land of his fathers.&nbsp;In recalling these instructions from G’d which he had&nbsp;complied with, he sees the justification for appealing to G’d to&nbsp;save him from Esau while he is on the way to fulfill G’d’s&nbsp;commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.11. קטונתי מכל החסדים</span><span class="font5">, “I have not been worthy of all&nbsp;the acts of kindness;” Yaakov explains what prompts him to&nbsp;be so fearful; he says that G’d has already done more for him&nbsp;than he could have expected, seeing that he did not feel&nbsp;worthy of it. As a result of his unworthiness he was afraid that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Esau who had performed the commandment of honouring his father and mother all the years when he had been absent,&nbsp;had accumulated sufficient merits to emerge victorious in a&nbsp;military confrontation with him. [After all, his father had&nbsp;blessed him with being successful with his sword. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whenever the expression חסד and אמת occur in the Scriptures (together), they refer to someone having&nbsp;performed kind deeds, beyond the call of duty. Examples&nbsp;Genesis 49,29, when Yaakov asks his son Joseph to&nbsp;transport his remains to the land of Canaan and for him to be&nbsp;buried next to his wife Leah, although he had buried&nbsp;Joseph’s mother on the roadside where she had died. We&nbsp;find another example in Samuel II 15,20, where David&nbsp;excuses Gittai, from Gat, a gentile, from endangering himself&nbsp;while remaining in his company while he has to flee from his&nbsp;own son Avshalom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,12. מיד אחי, מיד עשו</span><span class="font5">, from (the hand of) my brother, from (the hand of) Esau.” If Yaakov had only referred to Esau&nbsp;as “my brother,” it could have referred to any blood relative. If&nbsp;he had referred to Esau only by his name, it could have been&nbsp;understood as referring to anyone named Esau. [Yaakov had&nbsp;used the same caution when spelling out for whom he would&nbsp;serve Lavan for his future wife, i.e. “your younger daughter,&nbsp;Rachel.” (29,18) Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פן יבא והכני אם על בנים</span><span class="font5">, “lest he come and smite me both mother and children.” Yaakov implied that if this were to&nbsp;happen, G’d forbid, how could the promises G’d had made to&nbsp;him that his children would develop into numerous tribes&nbsp;(28,13) come true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis of this phrase: Yaakov was not at all concerned about being killed </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">himself</span><span class="font5"> because he had&nbsp;G’d’s assurances. He was only concerned about the lives of&nbsp;his wives and children, concerning whom he did not have&nbsp;G’d’s assurance. G’d had only promised him personally that&nbsp;He would bring him safely back to his home (even though it&nbsp;might entail many detours, i.e. בכל אשר תלך), “wherever you&nbsp;will go” (28,15). This is why he specifically spelled this out&nbsp;with the words: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אם על בנים</span><span class="font5">, “mother and children.” Use of the&nbsp;preposition על in the sense of “with,” also occurs in Numbers&nbsp;28,10: על עולת התמיד, “with the daily burnt offering,” as well as&nbsp;in Numbers 19,5: על פרשה ישרף, “it is to be burned with its&nbsp;dung.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,14. מנחה לעשו אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “as a gift for his brother Esau.” He meant to be conciliatory regardless of Esau’s intentions&nbsp;concerning him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,16. גמלים מיניקות</span><span class="font5">, “female camels;” ובניהם, and their masculine young. The total number of camels was 30. How&nbsp;is this number arrived at? There were twenty female camels&nbsp;and 10 male camels. [Each mother animal had a female&nbsp;young with her. Ed.] The ratio was similar to that of the male&nbsp;and female donkeys which also totaled 30. After having read&nbsp;the details of the latter, we understand what is meant about&nbsp;the camels. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> however, there were 30&nbsp;male camels plus thirty female camels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">?</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למי אתה</span><span class="font5">, “Who do you belong to?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואמרת</span><span class="font5">: ״</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעבדך וגו</span><span class="font5">׳״, “you will say: ‘to your servant,&nbsp;etc.” Yaakov ordered his servants, the ones who&nbsp;accompanied the herds of gifts, to answer each question in&nbsp;the order in which it had been asked. To the question of:&nbsp;“who do these herds belong to?” the answer was to be: “they&nbsp;belong to your servant Yaakov and are a gift for my lord&nbsp;Esau.” In response to the question: ולמי אלה לפניך, “and to&nbsp;whom do these animals in front of you belong?” They were&nbsp;all to answer: “and he (Yaakov) is also following a short&nbsp;distance behind us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,21. ואמרתם גם הנה עבדך יעקב אחרינו</span><span class="font5">, you are to say:&nbsp;“your servant Yaakov is also not far behind us.” He made&nbsp;them repeat this answer twice. He told his servants that&nbsp;when they would see Esau they should not be afraid to&nbsp;address him in such a manner, i.e. by referring to their </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">own&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">master as Esau’s servant. In the event Esau would ask them&nbsp;why Yaakov did not precede them in order to welcome him,&nbsp;as befits a younger brother when he meets his older brother,&nbsp;you will say: etc.: he reasoned that he wanted Esau to be in&nbsp;a good frame of mind concerning him before actually setting&nbsp;eyes on him.” They were to reveal that Yaakov had felt the&nbsp;need to appease his older brother by means of the gift he&nbsp;had sent ahead of himself. He hoped that in view of this&nbsp;substantial gift Esau would be good tempered when they&nbsp;came face to face after so many years. These latter words&nbsp;were not spoken by the servants of Yaakov who walked with&nbsp;the animals, but are to be understood as editorial comment&nbsp;by the author of the Torah. If it were not so, Yaakov would&nbsp;have committed the psychological error of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">reminding </span><span class="font5">Esau&nbsp;of how he had once deceived him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והוא לן בלילה ההוא במחנה, </span><span class="font5">“and he (Yaakov) spent&nbsp;that night in the camp.” This is a reference to what we have&nbsp;read in verse14: וילן שם בלילה ההוא, “he spent the night there.”&nbsp;It has been repeated, as the gift that Yaakov sent to Esau&nbsp;has been reported in the meantime in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקם בלילה</span><span class="font5">, “he arose during that night;” he&nbsp;intended to flee via a different route. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקם בלילה הוא</span><span class="font5">, “a truncated phrase, which if grammatically correct should have been: ויקם הוא בלילה, “he&nbsp;arose during the night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקח את שתי נשיו ואת שתי שפחותיו ואת אחד עשר ילדיו</span><span class="font5">, “he</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">took hold of his two wives, his two servant maids and his eleven children;” the wives are mentioned before the&nbsp;children, i.e. he transported them across the river first; he&nbsp;transported the wives across the river first, as he was more&nbsp;concerned with the children than with his wives; if Esau by&nbsp;chance should already have reached the far side of the river&nbsp;and was bent on killing him and his family, he would meet his&nbsp;wives first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time when Lavan had chased Yaakov, (from behind), Yaakov had positioned his wives, Lavan’s daughters&nbsp;behind him, so that Lavan would meet up with his daughters&nbsp;first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יבק</span><span class="font5">, “the name of the river.” There are some commentators who claim that this is an alternate name for&nbsp;the river Jordan. They arrive at this conclusion by quoting&nbsp;Yaakov as saying to G’d in verse 11: “I have crossed the&nbsp;river Jordan the first time equipped only with my walking&nbsp;stick, and by now I have become two camps.” Here the river&nbsp;has been called: Yabbok.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאבק איש עמו</span><span class="font5">, “a man began to wrestle with him.”&nbsp;The “man,” was an angel who had assumed the form of a&nbsp;human being. The angel, Esau’s protective power, had come&nbsp;to prevent Yaakov from escaping from Esau. He realised&nbsp;soon that G’d’s assurances to Yaakov were strong enough to&nbsp;protect him against being harmed by Esau. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד עלות השחר</span><span class="font5">, “until dawn.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירא</span><span class="font5">, “the angel saw;” (realised)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי לא יוכל לו </span><span class="font5">“that he could not overpower Yaakov;” the words: לא יוכל, must be understood in the sense that Moses&nbsp;used them before taking leave from his people, when he&nbsp;said: in Deut. 31,2: לא אוכל עוד לצאת ולבא, “I cannot any longer&nbsp;lead you in war,” where he was physically fully able, but G’d&nbsp;had forbidden him to do so. The author cites more examples&nbsp;of the word יכול occurring in that sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויגע</span><span class="font5">, “he touched in a manner which twisted;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בכף ירכו</span><span class="font5">, “his hip joint;” he tried to dislocate his hip joint, hoping that this would cause him to fall down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותקע</span><span class="font5">, “he succeeded in dislocating it.” This is one of the words which can be interpreted in two opposite ways&nbsp;depending on the context in which they appear. A well known&nbsp;example is the root דשן, which can mean “to saturate,” i.e. to&nbsp;heap more and more of a substance onto something, but it&nbsp;also appears as removing excess ashes from the altar.&nbsp;(Compare Exodus 27,3) The root תקע is more familiar to us&nbsp;as meaning to firmly establish something, such as the pegs&nbsp;holding a tent to the ground it is on. Compare Genesis 31,25,&nbsp;ויעקב תקע את אהלו בהר, “and Yaakov placed his tent firmly on&nbsp;the mountain.” Compare Leviticus 6,3, Psalms 80,10, and&nbsp;Psalms 52,7. In our verse it describes the angel’s attempt to&nbsp;uproot Yaakov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כף ירך יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “the hip joint of Yaakov.” The angel succeeded to injure Yaakov despite G’d’s assurances to him&nbsp;that “I will protect you wherever you go;” because Yaakov&nbsp;allowed himself to be frightened of Esau in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">spite</span><span class="font5"> of G’d’s&nbsp;assurances. [This was a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">lack</span><span class="font5"> of faith in G’d’s promise. Ed.]&nbsp;We find something similar with Moses, whom the angel&nbsp;injured and almost killed. (The incident at the inn on the way&nbsp;to Egypt) He had been assured of G’d’s support (Exodus&nbsp;3,12) but displayed </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">fear</span><span class="font5"> of Pharaoh, and refused the mission&nbsp;to become the leader of the Jewish people and to return to&nbsp;Egypt. (Exodus 3,13) He had asked G’d to send anyone but&nbsp;him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,27. שלחני כי עלה השחר</span><span class="font5">, “give me permission to leave for dawn has arisen!” “Until now I held you up from&nbsp;proceeding according to plan; now it is your turn to let me be&nbsp;on my way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of this strange conversation: The angel told Yaakov that since it now was almost daylight, he&nbsp;no longer had anything to fear from him. It is not customary&nbsp;for destructive forces to do their jobs during the daylight&nbsp;hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אם ברכתני</span><span class="font5">, “unless you first give me a blessing.” Yaakov meant that he would not accept the angel’s words&nbsp;until he had demonstrated that he meant it, by giving him a&nbsp;blessing. After that he would feel confident that he no longer&nbsp;had reason to fear him and would not seek revenge because&nbsp;he had failed to disable him. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.29. כי שרית עם אל-הים</span><span class="font5">, “you have now become the equal of angels, but you have not succeeded in outranking&nbsp;them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;למה זה תשאל לשמי, </span><span class="font5">“why are you asking for my&nbsp;name?” The angel informs Yaakov that there is no point in&nbsp;knowing his name; he explains that when people that have&nbsp;not seen one another ever, upon meeting, will extend&nbsp;greetings with one another and bless each other wishing&nbsp;each other well, and ask one another for their names, they&nbsp;justify this in the event that they wished to communicate with&nbsp;each other in the future. If they do not know one another’s&nbsp;name and address, how could they communicate with each&nbsp;other? Knowing the angel’s name, just as in the case of&nbsp;Manoach in Judges 13,17, is important only when such&nbsp;occasions will arise. The angel assures Yaakov that in this&nbsp;instance there is no need for this as he knows his name and&nbsp;address and will not forget it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of why the angel retorted to Yaakov’s question with a question of his own, instead of with&nbsp;an answer, though he complied with Yaakov’s request to&nbsp;bless him: the reason why angels do not like to reveal their&nbsp;names is to prevent human beings to make them swear an&nbsp;oath concerning the mission that they had fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויזרח לו השמש</span><span class="font5">, “the sun shone for him.” In the&nbsp;regions in which the patriarchs lived, the sun’s rays became&nbsp;stronger on a daily basis starting in the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tevet,</span><span class="font5"> until&nbsp;in the month </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of Tammuz</span><span class="font5"> the days started to become shorter&nbsp;and the sun’s rays weaker. Our author tries to show how the&nbsp;season’s variations are hinted at in the words of the Torah&nbsp;here. The reason why the author does this is because he&nbsp;was troubled by the Torah in our verse making it appear as if&nbsp;the sun shone </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> for Yaakov and not the rest of the world.&nbsp;He uses the numerical value of the word: 36=לו, as the basis&nbsp;of this exegesis. [I have decided to omit the details of this&nbsp;astronomical part of his exegesis of this verse. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא צולע על ירכו, “</span><span class="font5">and he was limping, i.e. dragging his feet.” He had not been able to leave </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peduel</span><span class="font5"> before the sun&nbsp;was shining strongly and its healing rays enabled him to&nbsp;walk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: no one had noticed his limp until the sun shone. The grammatical construction of our verse&nbsp;would be parallel to Genesis 29,25 when the Torah writes:&nbsp;ויהי בבקר והנה היא לאה, “it was morning when he found out&nbsp;(Yaakov) that it was Leah (in bed with him)”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על כן לא יאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “therefore it is appropriate that the&nbsp;Israelites do not eat, etc.;” this construction is parallel to&nbsp;Isaiah 10,7: והוא לא כן ידמה, “but it does not seem like this to&nbsp;him;” in other words: it would be right and proper to punish&nbsp;the Israelites not to eat that particular sinew as they should&nbsp;not have allowed their founding father to be exposed to&nbsp;hostile forces at night. Yaakov’s sons were physically strong,&nbsp;and they should have been at hand to assist their father if the&nbsp;need arose to do so. Seeing that they failed to do this, the&nbsp;blame for the injury sustained by their father was theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From now on they would have learned their lesson and would practice the commandment to accompany their father,&nbsp;or for that matter, any older and wiser person, especially at&nbsp;night. Yaakov himself set an example when he accompanied&nbsp;his son Joseph part of the way on a mission which he had&nbsp;sent him on, and which was potentially dangerous. (Genesis&nbsp;37,14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different approach to the verse above: as a result of their father Yaakov having stood up to the protective celestial&nbsp;force of Esau, his sons stopped eating the part of the body&nbsp;that the angel had been able to injure. They did this out of a&nbsp;feeling of pride in their founding father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third approach to this verse: due to their father Yaakov having sustained an injury, his descendants&nbsp;voluntarily decided not to eat the part of the body of an&nbsp;animal that had been injured in their father’s body. This has&nbsp;to be understood better by the use of a parable; a person&nbsp;suffered from a headache or from pains in a different part of&nbsp;his body. As a reminder of that pain he decides not to eat&nbsp;that part of the body of an animal as a symbol of his having&nbsp;been healed from that pain, so that it (abstention) would&nbsp;serve as a remedy for them (preventive medicine) in the&nbsp;future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baraitah</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> 101 which relates that people came to Rabbi Yehudah who had expressed the&nbsp;opinion that the prohibition not to eat that part of an animal&nbsp;also applied to animals that were altogether forbidden to be&nbsp;eaten, questioning his interpretation by citing the fact that&nbsp;only the descendants of Israel were forbidden to eat this part&nbsp;of an animal, and that the Jews had never been called&nbsp;“Children of Israel” until they had been given the Torah at&nbsp;Mount Sinai. He answered them that it is true that this&nbsp;custom did not become Jaw until the Torah was given, but it&nbsp;had been observed already earlier. It was recorded here only&nbsp;in order for us to understand the reason behind this&nbsp;prohibition. Prior to the legislation of dietary laws at Mount&nbsp;Sinai, Yaakov’s descendants were allowed to eat also the&nbsp;meat of animals that were outlawed at Mount Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויפול על צוארו, </span><span class="font5">“he (Esau) embraced his neck”; the&nbsp;letter י in the word צואריו, is missing here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישקהו</span><span class="font5">, “he kissed him;” this word has dots above the letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?מי אלה לך</span><span class="font5">, “how are these related to you?” Esau&nbsp;wanted to know if these people were Yaakov’s children or&nbsp;members of his household not biologically related to him, or if&nbsp;they were his slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,6. השפחות, הנה וילדיהן ותשתחוין</span><span class="font5">, “the servant maids, they and their children, and they prostrated themselves; but&nbsp;their children did not prostrate themselves, seeing that they&nbsp;were only children of servants, Esau would not insist on their&nbsp;making an obeisance to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the children only approached Esau as a sign of courtesy together with their respective&nbsp;mothers. They were not willing to prostrate themselves&nbsp;together with their mothers. Their reasoning was that their&nbsp;mothers being servants themselves naturally had to make an&nbsp;obeisance; however they, who were sons of Yaakov, were&nbsp;not prepared to make any obeisance to anyone. When the&nbsp;sons of Leah and Rachel saw that their mothers made an&nbsp;obeisance they decided to do the same. This is why the&nbsp;Torah in verses 7 and 8 writes: וישתחוו, “they prostrated&nbsp;themselves,” in the masculine mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נגש יוסף ורחל, </span><span class="font5">Joseph and Rachel approached; it is&nbsp;customary for the Torah when referring to a man and a&nbsp;woman in the same story to mention the name of the man&nbsp;first. Earlier, in verse 2, the Torah had mentioned the women&nbsp;first, even Rachel before Joseph. If you were to ask why&nbsp;Yaakov had not hidden Rachel and Joseph just as he is&nbsp;supposed to have hidden Dinah, seeing that the Torah says&nbsp;that he presented only 11 of his 12 children to Esau? We&nbsp;would have to answer that all of Avraham’s descendants up&nbsp;to that time had strictly refrained from violating a married&nbsp;woman sexually. There was therefore no reason to suspect&nbsp;Esau of doing such a thing. Dinah, was single however, so&nbsp;that Yaakov reasoned that he might violate her. Joseph was&nbsp;not so sure and therefore insisted on keeping company with&nbsp;his mother. [Seeing that he was at most seven years old at&nbsp;the time, it is difficult to see how he could have protected his&nbsp;mother in such a case. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי על כן ראיתי פניך</span><span class="font5">, “for I have made a special effort&nbsp;to meet you face to face in order to present you with this gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word: ראיתי, in the past tense, although at the time described Yaakov had not yet met Esau face to face, may be&nbsp;understood in the same way as when Avraham said to Efron,&nbsp;concerning the money for the field and cave of Machpelah,&nbsp;“נתתי כסף השדה, “I have given the money for the field;” (he had&nbsp;not yet given it though he kept it at hand) (Compare 23,13)&nbsp;Compare also the expression: הרימותי ידי ,“I have raised my&nbsp;hand in an oath,”(14,23) where Avraham is prepared to&nbsp;swear that he will not accept any loot from the King of&nbsp;Sodom. He was about to swear this oath, but had not yet&nbsp;done so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כראות פני אלוהים, “as if being received by G’d.” (After a pilgrimage) The Torah demanded from each pilgrim to&nbsp;Jerusalem during the three festivals not to appear empty-handed. (Deuteronomy 16,16, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit Rabbah 78,12.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי הילדים רכים</span><span class="font5">, “for the children are frail;” when&nbsp;speaking of the flocks, Yaakov had expressed the fear that&nbsp;they die if rushed;” we find reference to something like this in&nbsp;Job 21,11: וילדיהן ירקדון, “and their children skip about.”&nbsp;Yaakov’s wives and children were riding slowly on camels.&nbsp;(Compare 31,17.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עד אשר אבוא אל אדוני שעירה</span><span class="font5">, “until I shall join up&nbsp;with my lord in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Se=ir.</span><span class="font5"> Yaakov meant that once he had settled&nbsp;his wives and children and had made suitable arrangements&nbsp;for his flocks and herds, he would visit his brother in his&nbsp;homeland, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Se-ir.</span><span class="font5"> At that time there would be an opportunity&nbsp;to celebrate their reunion with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,16. וישב ביום ההוא עשו</span><span class="font5">, “on that day Esau returned;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> from this verse we derive that the four&nbsp;hundred men who had formed Esau’s entourage had simply&nbsp;melted away, seeing Esau is described as returning alone.&nbsp;They had clearly still been with him in verse 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,18. ויבא יעשב שלם</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov arrived intact at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shalem; </span><span class="font5">he arrived at a town named </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shalem,</span><span class="font5"> a suburb of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">named after the ruler of that region. We find similar examples&nbsp;of capitals being identified with the names of their respective&nbsp;rulers, such as in Numbers 21,26, Sichon and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cheshbon.</span><span class="font5"> A&nbsp;different interpretation: The place called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shalem</span><span class="font5"> was actually&nbsp;the city </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem.</span><span class="font5"> As long as Yaakov had not suffered the&nbsp;indignity of Dinah’s rape, his return to the land of Canaan,&nbsp;had been </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shalem,</span><span class="font5"> perfect, without incident. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Shalem”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">mentioned here is not the same as the one we have heard&nbsp;about in Genesis 14, i.e. Jerusalem, over which Malki&nbsp;Tzedek was king, but it is identical with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem,</span><span class="font5"> a town&nbsp;never called Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחן את פני העיר</span><span class="font5">, “he encamped next to the city.” One reason was that he had too many possessions to be&nbsp;absorbed inside the city, and he did not feel comfortable&nbsp;about mingling with the inhabitants of that city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,20. ויקרא לו</span><span class="font5">, He called it א-ל, the construction is similar to Genesis 20 13: אמרי לי אחי הוא, “say, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">concerning&nbsp;me,</span><span class="font5"> that he is my brother.” The word לו here may be&nbsp;understood as if it had been עלי, “on it,” in other words: he&nbsp;proclaimed the altar as dedicated the G’d Who is the G’d of&nbsp;Israel. This is also how Onkelos translates it. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">emphasises that it was not the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">altar</span><span class="font5"> that was called: “the G’d&nbsp;of Israel,” by the nations of the world, but that Yaakov called&nbsp;it by a name that symbolised the special relationship&nbsp;between G’d and Israel on account of all the miracles He had&nbsp;performed for him. It is not so different from when he called&nbsp;the site where he had the dream with the ladder 34 years&nbsp;earlier, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beyt El</span><span class="font5"> (Genesis 5,7), after he erected an altar there.&nbsp;We find a similar construction in Judges 6,24 where Gideon&nbsp;built an altar in honour of G’d, and named it: ה' שלום. This is&nbsp;also how we understand the name Moses gave the altar he&nbsp;built after having fought off the Amalekites in Exodus 17,17&nbsp;which became known as ה' נסי, “the Lord is my Banner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.7. מן השדה כשמעם m,</span><span class="font5">”returned from the field after hearing (about Dinah’s rape).” They returned prematurely, in&nbsp;a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכן לא יעשה</span><span class="font5">, “and such a thing must not happen,” even to the daughter of common parents, much less one of a&nbsp;distinguished family such as ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,13. במרמה</span><span class="font5">, “with slyness;” the sons of Yaakov never expected for a moment that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5"> and his father </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chamor&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">would agree to this condition to circumcise themselves and&nbsp;all the males in the city merely on account of a young girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They reasoned that seeing that not all the males in that city would perform circumcision on themselves, they would be&nbsp;free to take their revenge on them. This is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mirmah</span><span class="font5"> that&nbsp;the Torah speaks about here. At any rate they were fully&nbsp;justified to attack the population of that city as we will explain&nbsp;shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,14. כי חרפה היא לנו</span><span class="font5">, “for it is something shameful in our eyes.” Their argument was as follows: “if you do not&nbsp;circumcise yourselves as part of the bargain then one fine&nbsp;day you will declare all of us as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">baaley mum,</span><span class="font5"> cripples or&nbsp;deformed because we lack a foreskin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,19. והוא נכבד מכל בית אביו</span><span class="font5">, “and he was the most revered person of his father’s family.” He knew that they&nbsp;would not refuse his request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,21. רחבת ידים</span><span class="font5">, “enough large </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">places</span><span class="font5">:” we find the word: יד used in this sense also in Deuteronomy. 23,13 ויד&nbsp;תהיה לך, “you shall have a small </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">place</span><span class="font5"> there” and explained in&nbsp;this sense by Ibn Ezra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל יוצאי שער עירו</span><span class="font5">, “here the Torah speaks about&nbsp;people leaving his city,” whereas in 23,10, it spoke about כל&nbsp;באי עירו, “all the people coming into the gate of the town.” In&nbsp;this instance no one was allowed to leave the city until after&nbsp;he had been circumcised. In chapter 23 above everybody&nbsp;came in order to pay their respects to Sarah on the occasion&nbsp;of her forthcoming burial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי ביום השלישי בהיותם כואבים</span><span class="font5">, “It was on the third&nbsp;day when they are in pain:” they were all in pain and&nbsp;regretted having agreed to undergo circumcision: when&nbsp;Yaakov’s sons heard about this and they also heard that&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chamor</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5"> had altered the conditions they had&nbsp;agreed to with them, i.e. that no one was allowed to leave the&nbsp;town before he had undergone circumcision, plus their&nbsp;having presented the whole agreement as due to enhancing&nbsp;the honour of the people of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5"> instead of in response&nbsp;to an ultimatum by the sons of Yaakov, plus the fact that they&nbsp;boasted that henceforth the herds and flocks of Yaakov’s&nbsp;family would (verse 23) be theirs, they decided to attack the&nbsp;city’s inhabitants. The reason they had waited until the third&nbsp;day was that it took the people of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5"> until that day to&nbsp;complete the process of circumcising all the men and boys.&nbsp;On that day those who had been circumcised on the first day&nbsp;were still suffering from pains and relatively weak. This is&nbsp;why the Torah writes: ויבואו על הער בטח, “they came into the&nbsp;city unopposed, without having to worry.” This is also how&nbsp;Onkelos translated it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: Shimon and Levi entered the town while the inhabitants were sitting, feeling themselves secure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהרגו כל זכר, </span><span class="font5">“they killed every male inhabitant; they were all guilty as gentiles are also commanded to appoint a&nbsp;judicial court in every town and when it became known that&nbsp;Sh’chem had raped Dinah and abducted her, refusing to&nbsp;release her, he should have been tried and convicted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,26. ויקחו את דינה מבית שכם</span><span class="font5">, “they took Dinah from the house of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem;”</span><span class="font5"> Rabbi Yudon claims that they had to&nbsp;drag her along on the floor, as she was unwilling to come&nbsp;along willingly. Rabbi Chunia claims that it is a known fact&nbsp;that a girl or woman who has had sexual relations with a&nbsp;gentile is difficult to separate from that gentile (Compare&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 80,11).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,31. ?הכזונה יעשה את אחותנו</span><span class="font5">, ,“is he </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sh’chem)</span><span class="font5"> to be allowed to treat our sister as if she were a harlot?” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explains the word את in this phrase as emphasising the&nbsp;singular mode as the word אחותנו, occurs several times in the&nbsp;Bible in the plural mode although not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">spelled </span><span class="font5">in the plural&nbsp;mode with the letter י. [In Aramaic it would then have to be&nbsp;spelled אחותנא instead of אחתנא.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,1. קום עלה בית א-ל, </span><span class="font5">“arise and go to Bet-El!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">explains that Yaakov was commanded to keep the vow he&nbsp;had made at the time when he had the dream with the&nbsp;ladder. G’d implied that if he had not delayed keeping that&nbsp;vow the problem with Dinah would not have befallen him. If&nbsp;you were to argue that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> himself, when commenting on&nbsp;Yaakov presenting only eleven of his children before Esau&nbsp;because he was afraid that Esau might violate her, was&nbsp;punished for having failed to seize the opportunity that she&nbsp;might bring him back to the faith of his father? How does this&nbsp;tally with what he writes here? It tallies absolutely! She could&nbsp;not have become the victim of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5"> if Esau would have&nbsp;expressed a desire for her. [I do not see a problem at all. If&nbsp;Yaakov thought he had to protect her from his own brother,&nbsp;why was Dinah not chaperoned and allowed to leave the&nbsp;house on her own and roam amongst </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Canaanites</span><span class="font5">?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font5">was an additional act of neglect by her father, who was punished here for this act of neglect. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,2. הסירו את אלוהי הנכר</span><span class="font5">, “remove the alien deities!” This was required in order to avoid giving the impression that&nbsp;prayers or sacrifices were intended for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,4. אשר באזניהם</span><span class="font5">, “which were in the ears of those idols.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.6. לוזה אשר בארץ כנען</span><span class="font5">, “towards Luz which is in the land of Canaan.” There was another town called Luz,&nbsp;elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;האלו־הים</span><span class="font5">, the angels (according to Ibn Ezra)&nbsp;scriptural proof: Genesis 32,2: ויפגעו בו מלאכי אלו-הים, “angels&nbsp;of G’d met him there.” Also: Genesis 28,12: -והנה מלאכי אלו&nbsp;הים, “and lo here there were angels of G’d.” (in his dream)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותמת דבורה, </span><span class="font5">“Deborah died;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains why&nbsp;the Torah suddenly inserts this statement and how it is&nbsp;relevant. We never knew that she was part of Yaakov’s&nbsp;entourage. After all, Yaakov himself had said that when he&nbsp;crossed the river Jordan the first time he had been&nbsp;accompanied only by his walking stick (Compare Genesis&nbsp;32,11) Rivkah had told Yaakov (Genesis 27,44-45) that she&nbsp;would let him know when it was safe to return, when Esau’s&nbsp;wrath had cooled off. She had dispatched Deborah to Padan&nbsp;Arom to inform Yaakov of this. Yaakov had not been willing&nbsp;to return already. Deborah remained with him in the house of&nbsp;Lavan and passed away on the journey on the way back to&nbsp;the land of Canaan. When she had been mentioned the first&nbsp;time (Genesis 24,59) she had only been described as&nbsp;Rivkah’s nursemaid; now the Torah supplied her name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,10. ,לא יקרא שמך עוד יעקב'שמך יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “your name has&nbsp;been Yaakov; it will no longer be Yaakov;” The Torah means&nbsp;that henceforth his name would no longer </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> be “Yaakov,”&nbsp;but the name “Yisrael” would be added to it. If the name&nbsp;“Yaakov” were to be eliminated completely, this would be&nbsp;interpreted as having been a name describing a person with&nbsp;negative character traits up to now. (Compare Esau’s&nbsp;comment in Genesis 27,36) Henceforth the Torah will refer to&nbsp;Yaakov-Yisrael sometimes by his original name and&nbsp;sometimes only by his additional name. When G’d changed&nbsp;Avram’s name to Avraham, He had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span><span class="font5"> said that שמך אבדם,&nbsp;“your name is or was Avram.” This is why the sages have&nbsp;said that anyone referring to Avraham as Avram, is&nbsp;equivalent to violating a positive commandment of the Torah.&nbsp;(Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot</span><span class="font5"> 13).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אם ישראל יהיה שמך</span><span class="font5">, “but your name shall be Yisrael.” The name implies that the one possessing it wields authority,&nbsp;as the angel had said to Yaakov: ”you have contended with&nbsp;Divinity and you have prevailed.” (32,29) The name is very&nbsp;appropriate for you as you will be the founding father of&nbsp;kings. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here claims that the reference in this verse is to&nbsp;King Sha-ul and his son </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ish Boshet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Should you ask that we have been taught (in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin </span><span class="font5">20) that Avner was punished for having delayed David’s&nbsp;occupying the throne of the Kingdom for two and a half&nbsp;years, i.e. the years during which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ish Boshet</span><span class="font5"> ruled after he&nbsp;appointed him as Sha-ul’s successor; why would he be&nbsp;punished for this, seeing it has been decreed already in the&nbsp;Torah that he would rule (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)?</span><span class="font5"> We would&nbsp;have to answer that he was not punished for having crowned&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ish Boshet,</span><span class="font5"> but because he had crowned </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ish Boshet</span><span class="font5"> not&nbsp;because he considered him as fit to rule, but that he was&nbsp;motivated exclusively by trying to thwart David from&nbsp;ascending the throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,16. ויהי עוד כברת ארץ לבא אפרתה</span><span class="font5">, “it was still a short distance from Efrat;” the prefix ב is missing here before the&nbsp;word: עוד, the meaning of the phrase is as if it had been&nbsp;present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כברת ארץ</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam,</span><span class="font5"> the word is similar to Job 34,24 הביריה, and means “a considerable amount.” It is&nbsp;also compared to Isaiah 10,13, ואוריד כביר יושבים, “I have&nbsp;deposed those who have ruled for many years.” [The prophet&nbsp;quotes the boast of the King of Ashur. Ed.] In our verse the&nbsp;line means that Yaakov was still a considerable distance&nbsp;from the nearest human settlement where he could bury&nbsp;Rachel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי גם זה לך בן, </span><span class="font5">“for this child will also be a son for&nbsp;you;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> writes that the midwife referred by the word גם&nbsp;“also” to Joseph. She meant that Rachel’s prayer at the time&nbsp;when she gave birth to Joseph that she would be granted to&nbsp;give birth to another son had been fulfilled. (Compare 30,24)&nbsp;She encouraged Rachel with her words suggesting that it&nbsp;was not G’d’s intention to let her die at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בצאת נפשה כי מתה, </span><span class="font5">”when her soul departed as&nbsp;she was dying;” she was both dying and not dying;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בנימין</span><span class="font5">, the name is spelled with two letters י, as if it meant בן ימין, “the son of my right hand.” (Compare KimchiJ</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternate version: the last letter in the word is the letter ם, i.e. ימים, “days” or “years,” and means that Yaakov&nbsp;considered Benjamin as a son who would assist him in his&nbsp;old age, seeing that he was the youngest. We find support&nbsp;for this interpretation in Isaiah 51,18, אין מחזיק בידה מכל בנים&nbsp;גדלה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">no one takes her by the hand of all the sons she&nbsp;raised.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותקבר בדרך אפרתה</span><span class="font5">, “she was buried on the way to&nbsp;Efrat.” Rachel had lost so much blood during giving birth that&nbsp;Yaakov was not able to bring her to the cave of Machpelah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,21. למגדל עדר</span><span class="font5">, a tower not far from Efrat. We find a&nbsp;reference to this place in Micah 5,1: ואתה בית לחם אפרתה, and&nbsp;immediately afterwards: ואתה מגדל עדר.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the reason why Yaakov did not bury Rachel in that cave was that Esau had still not given&nbsp;up his claim that he would be buried there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the reconciliation between the brothers, Esau not only renounced this claim but eventually moved out of the&nbsp;land of Canaan altogether, leaving it for the descendants of&nbsp;Yaakov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,22. וישכב את בלהה</span><span class="font5">, “he slept with Bilhah.” This is not to be understood literally, but he invaded her privacy and&nbsp;messed up the linen on her bedstead, or simply moved her&nbsp;bed from its normal position. This was a protest against her&nbsp;trying to replace Rachel. Reuven, Leah’s oldest son, felt that&nbsp;now that Rachel had died, his mother should outrank any of&nbsp;the other wives of his father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points out that this is not the only instance when the Torah to make its point exaggerates the indiscretion&nbsp;committed by some people, or when it rounds up numbers.&nbsp;An example of such an exaggeration quoted is the injury that&nbsp;the angel had caused Yaakov in their nocturnal struggle. He&nbsp;had not made Yaakov’s hip joint useless, but had only&nbsp;dislocated it. (32,26)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישמע ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “Israel heard about this;” about Reuven’s indiscretion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהיו בני יעקב שנים עשר</span><span class="font5">, “the sons of Yaakov remained 12.” Yaakov had no more sons after this. The reason was&nbsp;that he no longer carried on marital relations with any of his&nbsp;wives. Our sages derive this from the line: אז חללת יצועי עלה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">“then you desecrated Him who abode on my bed.” (Genesis&nbsp;49,4) Yaakov meant that ever since the sanctity which had&nbsp;distinguished his marital bed had ceased to exist and been&nbsp;profaned. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5"> on that verse) The reason&nbsp;why here we have the words: וישמע ישראל, “Israel heard,”&nbsp;(instead of “Yaakov” heard) is so that when you read that&nbsp;verse in chapter 49 you will not ask: ‘how did Yaakov ever&nbsp;find out about Reuven’s indiscretion?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the reason why the line that Yaakov’s sons were and remained 12, is inserted here where&nbsp;reference is made to Reuven’s indiscretion, is in order not to&nbsp;allow anyone to think that possibly some of Yaakov’s sons&nbsp;might not have been his but Reuven’s, but it refers to the&nbsp;most recently born son born for him by Rachel. Yaakov&nbsp;together with all of his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">twelve</span><span class="font5"> sons returned to their father’s&nbsp;home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,26. אשר יולד לו בפדן ארם, </span><span class="font5">“that had been born for him in Padan Arom.” This statement begs the question that as we&nbsp;have just heard, Binyamin had not been born in Padan&nbsp;Arom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have to understand the verse as meaning that Binyamin had been born as a result of Rachel’s having&nbsp;prayed to G’d to give her another son while she had still been&nbsp;in Padan Arom (Compare Genesis 30,23. This is why the&nbsp;Torah here, 7 years later, describes Binyamin’s birth as&nbsp;dating back to that time.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis of this puzzling statement: Seeing that almost all of Yaakov’s children had been born while he&nbsp;was in Padan Arom, the Torah applies the Talmudic&nbsp;statement of רובם ככולם, “if the majority had been&nbsp;distinguished by a certain detail we view all of the ones&nbsp;referred to in that context as if they possessed the same&nbsp;distinguishing features.” We find this principle applied by the&nbsp;Torah also in Genesis 46,27, where 70 people are reported&nbsp;to have been brought to Egypt by Yaakov, although only 69&nbsp;names are listed, three of them being Joseph and his two&nbsp;sons. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash (B‘reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 94,9) claims that seeing&nbsp;that Moses’ mother was born at the border of Egypt, her birth&nbsp;completes the number 70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,29. ויקברו אותו עשו ויעקב בניו</span><span class="font5">, “and his sons Esau and Yaakov buried him.” Esau is mentioned first seeing that&nbsp;biologically, he remained the firstborn. Yaakov also treated&nbsp;him with the honour due to a firstborn. When the Torah&nbsp;describes the burial of Avraham, in which both his sons also&nbsp;participated, Yitzchok is mentioned first although he was 14&nbsp;junior to Yishmael, seeing Yishmael was the son of a slave-woman. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואלה תולדות עשו</span><span class="font5">, “and these are the descendants of&nbsp;Esau;” the prefix ו in the word: ואלה is to remind the reader&nbsp;that since the Torah had already listed the 12 sons of&nbsp;Yaakov, the time had come to list the descendants of Esau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'עשו לקח את נשיו מבנות כנען וגו</span><span class="font5">, “Esau had taken his&nbsp;wives from the daughters of the Canaanites, etc.;” here the&nbsp;Torah fails to mention the daughter of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beeri,</span><span class="font5"> although in&nbsp;Genesis 26,34 we have been told that Esau took Yehudit&nbsp;who was a daughter of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beeri,</span><span class="font5"> a Hittite as a wife. We must&nbsp;therefore assume that the reason she is not mentioned here&nbsp;is that she died without having provided Esau with any sons.&nbsp;All the sons mentioned in this chapter therefore must have&nbsp;been born by עדה בת אלון, who is identical with the wife called&nbsp;בשמת בת אלון, in Genesis 6,34 She had changed her name,&nbsp;just as had the daughter of Yishmael, which has now been&nbsp;called בשמת, whereas when she had first been introduced&nbsp;she had been called מחלת. (Compare 28,9.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אהליבמה בת ענה</span><span class="font5">, who according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> is identical with יהודית. If you were to ask: is this not the יהודית בת בארי as we&nbsp;have been told in 26,34? How could she now have been the&nbsp;daughter of ענה? Moreover, if we deal here with a woman&nbsp;who was a bastard, why did </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> not say that she was the&nbsp;combined product from these two fathers as he explained&nbsp;concerning ענה בת צבעון? We are forced to answer that בארי&nbsp;and ענה were one and the same person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בת ענה בת צבעון</span><span class="font5">. In this paragraph you find that ענה was a brother of צבעון, as is written: ושובל וצבעון וענה (and Shoval&nbsp;and Tzivon and Anah.” (verse 20.) You also find written in&nbsp;verse 24 that “these were the sons of Tzivon and Ayah and&nbsp;Anah;” this is what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> referred to that Tzivon must have&nbsp;slept with his own mother and from this carnal union Anah&nbsp;was born. In other words, he was both his son and his (half)&nbsp;brother. This is why the Torah wrote the unusual phrase: הוא&nbsp;ענה, “this is the Anah,” i.e. the one we have read about&nbsp;earlier. (Mentioned in verse 20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is also possible to say that the meaning of the words בת ענה בת צבעון, really is that he was the grandson, that&nbsp;Tzivon was the grandfather. It is not unusual in the Torah for&nbsp;grandchildren being described as the children of their&nbsp;grandfather. Examples cited are: בת מטרד בת מי זהב, in verse&nbsp;39 of our chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is an opinion voiced in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Batra </span><span class="font5">folio 115, that ענה is not the name of a male but of a female&nbsp;because the Torah wrote successively: בת ענת בת צבעון,&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">daughter</span><span class="font5"> of Anat, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">daughter</span><span class="font5"> of Tzivon.” If you were to counter&nbsp;that earlier we have read about </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">הוא</span><span class="font5"> ענה אשר מצא את הימים, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">he&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">was the Anah who discovered the species </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yemim,”</span><span class="font5"> so how&nbsp;could that have been a female? We would have to answer&nbsp;that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">she</span><span class="font5"> inherited in lieu of Ayah who was a male, and whose&nbsp;brother was a brother of Anah. The fact that “he” is not listed&nbsp;among the sons who founded or became leaders of&nbsp;thousands, i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">alufim,</span><span class="font5"> would lend support to the opinion that&nbsp;we are dealing with a female who could not qualify for such a&nbsp;rank</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">36,5. ואהליבמה ילדה את יעיש, and Oholibama bore Yayish. This name is spelled יעיש but is read as if it had been spelled&nbsp;יעוש.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">36,6. וילך אל ארץ, “he went (emigrated) to a land.” Esau conquered the land of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Se-ir</span><span class="font5"> from the people known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chorim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains what motivated Esau to leave the land of Canaan voluntarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to counter that at the beginning of this portion it is written: ארצה שעיר שדה אדום, “that Yaakov had&nbsp;dispatched his messengers to ”the land of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Se-ir</span><span class="font5"> otherwise&nbsp;known as the field of Edom, (which gives the reader the&nbsp;impression that Esau had already taken possession of that&nbsp;land at that time) and it entitles us to think that Esau already&nbsp;lived there, we have to assume that up until the period&nbsp;mentioned in our verse here he had lived alternately both in&nbsp;the land of Canaan and in the land of Se </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ir.</span><span class="font5"> It was only after&nbsp;Yaakov had returned to the land of Canaan and the brothers&nbsp;had been reconciled, that Esau vacated the land of Canaan,&nbsp;thus acknowledging that this would become the land&nbsp;possessed as ancestral home by the descendants of&nbsp;Yaakov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">מפני יעקב אחיו, “on account of Yaakov, his brother.” Seeing that he had sold the birthright to Yaakov, thus making&nbsp;Yaakov the legal heir of Yitzchok, he left for a foreign country&nbsp;to show that he did no longer dispute Yaakov’s claim to that&nbsp;land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">36,12. ותמנע היתה פלגש, “and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Timna</span><span class="font5"> had become a concubine;” in Chronicles I 1,36 we read that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Timna</span><span class="font5"> was a&nbsp;male. How can we reconcile this with what is written here?&nbsp;We must assume that there were two people called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Timna,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">one a male (grandson of Esau from Eliphaz) and one a&nbsp;female. Here she is described as a sister of Lotan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At any rate the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Timna</span><span class="font5"> mentioned here as a concubine refers to both of them, and this is the reason why there is the&nbsp;cantillation mark </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pessik,</span><span class="font5"> (vertical line) separating the word</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Timna</span><span class="font5"> from the word היתה “had become,” a most unusual place to have that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pessik.</span><span class="font5"> We have to read the verse as&nbsp;follows: “the sons of Eliphaz were Teyman, Omar,Tzefo, and&nbsp;Gatom and Knaz and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Timna</span><span class="font5">; and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Timna</span><span class="font5"> had become the&nbsp;concubine of Eliphaz, son of Esau and she bore a son&nbsp;named Amalek for Eliphaz; these are the children of Adah&nbsp;the wife of Esau. We find a similar construction to this in the&nbsp;Book of Joshua 13,7-8: ועתה חלק את הארץ הזאת בנחלה לתשעת&nbsp;השבטים וחצי שבט מנשה עמו הראובני והגדי לקחו נחלתם וגו', “and now&nbsp;distribute this land as ancestral property to the nine tribes&nbsp;and the half tribe of Menashe; the Reubenites and the&nbsp;Gadites and the (other) half tribe of Menashe had already&nbsp;taken possession of their ancestral portions.” Seeing that the&nbsp;expression “and the half tribe of Menashe” appears only&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">once</span><span class="font5">, we have to read is as applying both to the first part of&nbsp;the two verses as well as to the second part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ותמנע היתה פלגש לאליפז, “and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Timna</span><span class="font5"> had become a concubine for Eliphaz;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> she was not&nbsp;counted with the descendants of the tribe of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Se-ir</span><span class="font5"> as she was&nbsp;only a sister of the sons of Eliphaz through her mother and&nbsp;not through her father. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> suggests that had she been a&nbsp;full sister, she would have been counted here with the&nbsp;descendants of Eliphaz. [Here the author mentions the&nbsp;disagreement amongst our sages about gentiles being able&nbsp;to trace their ancestry to the father or not, seeing that there&nbsp;never was a certainty about the identity of a gentile father as&nbsp;all had been sleeping around with different women.&nbsp;(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5"> on verse 15 Ed.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds that it is&nbsp;permitted (for gentiles) to marry the daughter of one’s father&nbsp;because we do not accept the opinion that national ancestry&nbsp;is based on one’s father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">36,14. ותלד לעשו את יעוש “she bore </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ye-ush</span><span class="font5"> for Esau.” The word is spelled as יעיש, but read as if it had been spelled&nbsp;יעוש.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">36,16. אלוף קרח, “a chieftain over a thousand, named&nbsp;Korach. This person has already been listed amongst the&nbsp;sons of Eliphaz that has been mentioned in Chronicles I&nbsp;1,36, seeing that the Korach who was a son of Oholivamah is&nbsp;a different Korach. In the tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah 13, Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains&nbsp;that there was a Korach who was the son of Eliphaz as well&nbsp;as a Korach who was the son of Oholivamah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators argue that both times the Torah refers to the same Korach; the reason why the Torah&nbsp;mentions the “second” Korach is only because he lived&nbsp;together with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">alufey</span><span class="font5"> Eliphaz. His mother Oholivamah died&nbsp;while Korach was still very young and she adopted him and&nbsp;raised him with her own children. We find something parallel&nbsp;concerning Amalek, who is linked together with the sons of&nbsp;Adah because he was the son of Adah’s servant maid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלה בני שעיר וגו</span><span class="font5">, “these were the sons of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Se-ir,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">etc.” We do not know </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Se-ir’s</span><span class="font5"> ancestry. The Torah mentions&nbsp;his offspring merely in order to distinguish them from Esau’s&nbsp;offspring, seeing that the Torah (Deuteronomy 2,12)&nbsp;discusses them in connection with the nations whom the&nbsp;Israelites under Moses and Joshua are not to attack or&nbsp;harass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יושבי הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “the inhabitants of the land;” originally that land had belonged to them as we know from Deuteronomy&nbsp;2,12: ובני עשו יירשום וישבו תחתם, “an the descendants of Esau&nbsp;disinherited them and settled there in their place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וצבעון וענה</span><span class="font5">, “and Tzivon and Anah;” this was the same Tzivon who had slept with his mother as a result of which&nbsp;Anah had been born. Subsequently, he slept with his&nbsp;daughter-in-law, the wife of Anah, as a result of which he&nbsp;produced Oholivamah, Esau’s wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36.21. ודישון ואצר ודשן</span><span class="font5">, as well as Dishon, Atzar, and Dishan.” According to the vocalisation by the authors of the&nbsp;tradition that we rely on, the sequence for reading these&nbsp;names is as follows: דישון,דישן,דישון,דישן,דישן דישון,דישן to help&nbsp;us memorize this sequence (these names appear a total of&nbsp;seven times) it pays to commence with the seventh day, i.e.&nbsp;Shabbat. On the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">seventh</span><span class="font5"> day the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">second</span><span class="font5"> day and the fifth&nbsp;day of the week (the three days of the week the Torah is&nbsp;read in public) this recalls the spelling </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the letter ו. On the&nbsp;days of the week when we do not read from the Torah in&nbsp;public, i.e. first, third, fourth and sixth day, this recalls the&nbsp;times it is read as if spelled defectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do not be astounded concerning the phrasing of: ואלה בני דישן חמדן וגו', “and these were the sons of Dishon,&nbsp;Chemdon,” in verse 27. This refers to the first time we read&nbsp;about דישון. Verse 27 refers back to דישן in verse 26 which&nbsp;should have been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">vocalised</span><span class="font5"> as דישון. We must understand&nbsp;that whenever in the Holy Scriptures books written later, refer&nbsp;to names of persons or places which appear spelled&nbsp;differently from the first time they had appeared, they refer to&nbsp;the ones mentioned the first time in the Bible, unless&nbsp;otherwise stated. Examples of the names of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">people, or the same verbs, being spelled differently in&nbsp;different Books of the Bible, are: Samuel II 22 as opposed to&nbsp;Psalms chapter 18, where the word מגדל, in verse 51 of the&nbsp;former means the same as the word מגדיל in the verse 51 of&nbsp;Psalms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[You will note the similarity of the subject matter in both chapters, plus the fact that both of these words appear in&nbsp;verse 51 of the chapter mentioned. Compare also Genesis&nbsp;32,32 and 31 respectively, where the name of the place פנואל&nbsp;is once spelled with the letter ו and the other time with the&nbsp;letter י in the middle. Compare the spelling of the ears of corn&nbsp;in Pharaoh’s dream in Genesis 41,7 as דקות, and when&nbsp;Joseph interprets it in about it in Genesis 41,27, as רקות. Our&nbsp;author cites a few more examples which I have decided to&nbsp;skip as he has made his point. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,22. ואחות לוטן תמנע</span><span class="font5">, “Lotan’s sister was called Timna.” Seeing that Lotan was the senior of the brothers,&nbsp;Timna’s name appears next to his. [Normally, we would have&nbsp;expected the sequence: ותמנע אחות לוטן, “Timna was the&nbsp;sister of Lotan.” Ed.] We find a similar example of this&nbsp;construction in Genesis 28,9, as well as in Exodus 15,20 and&nbsp;in Exodus 6,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,24. אשר מצא את הימים, </span><span class="font5">“who discovered the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yemim. </span><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> these were animals that resulted from&nbsp;crossbreeding, and the Torah names him in order to chastise&nbsp;him for having successfully violated the principle of not&nbsp;crossbreeding. If you were to question that Anah could not&nbsp;have been the first person having done this as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> himself&nbsp;commenting on Genesis 26,13 on the words: ויגדל מאד, writes&nbsp;that people at that time already used to say that “the dung of&nbsp;the mules of Yitzchok are worth more than the god of their&nbsp;king,” which proves that mules, which are the result of&nbsp;crossbreeding horses and donkeys already existed and&nbsp;people were familiar with them, we have to understand this&nbsp;verse as follows: Anah was the first person who </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">deliberately&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">mated donkeys with horses. Prior to this, mules existed but&nbsp;they resulted from the mother animal having mated with a&nbsp;horse of its own account. The word: מצא means that he&nbsp;developed a system of breeding such animals successfully.&nbsp;He noted that in order to tell which animal was the result of a&nbsp;male donkey mating with a female horse, and which was the&nbsp;product of a she-ass having mated with a male horse, if the&nbsp;animal has thin ears it is the product of a female horse and a&nbsp;male donkey; when the ears are thick, it is proof that the&nbsp;mother animal was a she-ass and it had mated with a male&nbsp;horse. Seeing that G’d is very displeased with such&nbsp;procedures being undertaken by man, he is blamed for such&nbsp;practices having been introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation: the Torah wishes the reader to know that the animals resulting from cross-breeding are not&nbsp;included in the blessing given by the Creator to all the&nbsp;creatures He had created. Proof of this is the fact that such&nbsp;creatures cannot sire or give birth to another generation of&nbsp;their breed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,25. ואלה בני ענה</span><span class="font5">, “and these are the offspring of Anah:” even though the verse mentions both בני-ענה as well&nbsp;as בת-ענה they are the same person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,31. לפני מלך מלך לבני ישראל, </span><span class="font5">”before a king ruled over the Children of Israel;” the “king” referred to here is none&nbsp;other than Moses. We know that he was the equivalent of a&nbsp;crowned king from Deuteronomy 33,5: ויהי בישורון מלך, “he&nbsp;was King over Yeshurun” (pseudonym for Jewish people).&nbsp;The reason he was described by this “title” was that he had&nbsp;been the saviour of the Israelites when he took them out of&nbsp;Egypt.” [The word מלך is derived from מוליך, leading. He who&nbsp;is the leader of others is described as their “king,” i.e. מלך.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be incorrect to understand the comparison of historical developments between the descendants of Esau&nbsp;with those of the Jewish people who did not have a crowned&nbsp;head until Samuel crowned Sh-aul as their king about 400&nbsp;years after Moses’ death as recorded in Josephus, for after&nbsp;the kings mentioned here at least 40 kings whose names we&nbsp;know ruled over Edom before the ascent to the throne of the&nbsp;Jewish people by King David. Here only eight of these kings&nbsp;have been named. There were 14 generations between&nbsp;Avraham and King Sha-ul. When David ascended the throne&nbsp;of the Jewish people he deprived the Edomites of their King.&nbsp;We know this from Samuel II 8,14: וישם באדום נציבים ויהיו כל&nbsp;אדום עבדים לדוד, “he appointed governors in Edom, and all of&nbsp;Edom became a vassal state to David.” You find confirmation&nbsp;of this in Chronicles I 18,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,35. וימלוך תחתיו הדד</span><span class="font5">, “Haddad reigned in his stead.” The second time the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Haddad</span><span class="font5"> appears, it is spelled with&nbsp;the letter ד, whereas the third time it is spelled with the letter&nbsp;ר, i.e. הדר.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,40. ואלה שמות אלופי עשו למשפחותם למקומותם</span><span class="font5">, “the&nbsp;following are the names </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">alufim</span><span class="font5"> (clans) of Esau, according to&nbsp;their names and locations.” These latter ones were the&nbsp;principal descendants to be counted separately in each city&nbsp;that they dwelled; this is why here the Torah adds the word:&nbsp;למקומותם, “according to the localities they lived in.” The Torah&nbsp;also adds the word: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחוזתם</span><span class="font5">, “their ancestral homes,” in verse&nbsp;43. Proof of the importance of the ones listed here is the fact&nbsp;that the previous ones have not been listed in Chronicles I&nbsp;1,51-54 at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Vayeshev</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישב יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov settled down;” this is recorded&nbsp;as something parallel to Esau’ settling down having been&nbsp;reported in Mount </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Se-ir</span><span class="font5"> in Genesis 36,8. After Esau having&nbsp;settled on what is now ancestral land for him. ( ואתן לעשו את הר&nbsp;שעיר, “I have given to Esau Mount </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Se-ir.)</span><span class="font5"> (Joshua 24,3)&nbsp;Yaakov is now described as having done something similar&nbsp;on the land promised by G’d to Avraham and his&nbsp;descendants commencing with Yitzchok and Yaakov. G’d&nbsp;had renewed this promise to Yaakov during his first vision in&nbsp;which he saw a ladder to heaven. Both Avraham and&nbsp;Yitzchok had only lived on that soil as sojourners, מגורי אביו;&nbsp;Yaakov’s claim was based on the law of the birthright,&nbsp;something he had purchased from Esau. At this time, when&nbsp;Esau went to the land of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Se-ir,</span><span class="font5"> he went as an alien.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">בארץ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מגורי אביו בארץ כנען</span><span class="font5">, “in the land in which his father sojourned, in the land of Canaan.” The Torah had to write&nbsp;both these details, even though it is common knowledge that&nbsp;Yitzchok never set foot on soil outside the land of Canaan. If&nbsp;the Torah had only mentioned the words מגורי אביו, “where his&nbsp;father had sojourned,” we would not know to which land it&nbsp;referred. In fact I might have thought that the Torah speaks&nbsp;about Ur Casdim where Avraham had sojourned for many&nbsp;years. If the Torah had only written: בארץ כנען, “in the land of&nbsp;Canaan,” I would not have known near which city Yaakov&nbsp;settled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישב יעקב בארץ מגורי אביו. “</span><span class="font5">Yaakov settled in the land his fathers had sojourned in.” The </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">entire</span><span class="font5"> line was written in order&nbsp;to show that G’d had kept his promise to both Avraham and&nbsp;Yitzchok, and that one of their descendants had already not&nbsp;only sojourned in this land but had settled in it, and had&nbsp;acquired land in it through purchase. (33,19) In fact the&nbsp;expression ישיבה, referring to being settled did appear in&nbsp;connection with both Avraham and Yitzchok, as we know&nbsp;from 26,12, and 13,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אלה תולדות יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “these are the descendants of&nbsp;Yaakov;” wherever a paragraph commences with the word:&nbsp;אלה, this means that this a paragraph that is not the&nbsp;continuation of the subject which had been discussed&nbsp;immediately before it. In this instance, the word is used to&nbsp;remind the reader that the personalities referred to&nbsp;immediately before this paragraph, were all wicked people,&nbsp;i.e. bastards, born of parents guilty of practicing incest. The&nbsp;personalities who are the subject of our chapter were all born&nbsp;from parents who had formed legitimate unions. They are the&nbsp;descendants of both Yehudah and Joseph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלה תולדות יעקב, יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “these were the descendants of Yaakov: Joseph;” the reason why this has been repeated&nbsp;here is because the Torah had interrupted reporting about&nbsp;Yaakov’s children who had been sired and born while he was&nbsp;with Lavan, Joseph having been the last of those. We find&nbsp;that the Torah employed a similar manner when describing&nbsp;Noach (Genesis 5,8) as siring three sons, interrupting with a&nbsp;description of the sins which led to the deluge, before&nbsp;returning to the subject in Genesis 6,9 with the words: אלה&nbsp;תולדות נח, although we had already known who his children&nbsp;were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">היה רועה את אחיו בצאן</span><span class="font5">, “who was tending flocks with his brothers;” The Torah calls the sons of Leah Joseph’s&nbsp;”brothers,” as they were the sons of their father’s principal&nbsp;wives; it did not refer to the sons of Zilpah and Bilhah by the&nbsp;same term. [although </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> Leah’s sons as well as those of&nbsp;the maids were half brothers. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of why the word אחיו was used</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא נער</span><span class="font5">, “he was only tending flocks as long as he was still very young;” at that point it was not considered as below&nbsp;the dignity of the sons of Yaakov’s secondary wives to be&nbsp;tending flocks with them. The verse is actually truncated, and&nbsp;the complete text should have been: והוא נער היה רועה בצאן את&nbsp;אחיו בני בלהה ובני זלפה, “as long as he was a young boy he had&nbsp;been tending flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and&nbsp;Zilpah.” It is not surprising that he reported on what he&nbsp;considered misconduct by these “brothers,” seeing that he&nbsp;was still very immature, i.e. merely a .נער</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בצאן</span><span class="font5">, we would have expected the Torah to have written either “את צאן, or הצאן.” The reason why the Torah used the&nbsp;prefix ב, is to draw our attention to the fact that his major&nbsp;occupation was to watch if he could find fault with the&nbsp;manner in which these “brothers” fulfilled their tasks. He was&nbsp;concerned that his “brothers”: would not do something that&nbsp;would harm his father’s property, as he was extremely loyal&nbsp;to his father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבא יוסף אץ דבתם רעה, </span><span class="font5">“Joseph reported negative reports about them;” (no wonder that they all began to hate him as a&nbsp;tale bearer). The sons of Bilhah and Zilpah hated him as&nbsp;talebearer, and his other brothers hated him because he was&nbsp;a favorite of their father. They were therefore afraid that in&nbsp;due course their father would appoint him as his firstborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Torah writes (in verse four: וישנאו אותו, “they hated him,”) it refers to all of the brothers except Binyamin&nbsp;who was only 10-11 years old. Each group of brothers had a&nbsp;different reason for hating him. They were afraid that their&nbsp;father would treat Joseph as their grandfather Yitzchok had&nbsp;treated his son Esau, because of emotional attachment, not&nbsp;based on objective considerations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37,3. כי בן זקונים הוא לו</span><span class="font5">, “for he had been born to him in his old age. If you were to argue that Binyamin had been&nbsp;born when he was still older, Binyamin caused his father to&nbsp;be reminded of the fact that his very </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">existence</span><span class="font5"> brought about&nbsp;his beloved wife Rachel’s death, something which prevented&nbsp;him from loving him as much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פסים</span><span class="font5">, a name that was to be given to this garment retroactively after Joseph had been sold. [Each letter of the&nbsp;word refers to a different master to whom Joseph had been&nbsp;sold, commencing with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מ </span><span class="font5">for the Midianites and ending with פ&nbsp;for Potiphar.] A different explanation sees in the word פסים as&nbsp;a “compensation,” for being a half orphan, not having a&nbsp;mother anymore. Yaakov tried to compensate him by having&nbsp;a costly garment made for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.5. ויחלום יוסף חלום ויגד לאחיו</span><span class="font5">, “Joseph dreamt a dream and he told his brothers its content.” This was a dream that&nbsp;never came true. This is why the Torah does not reveal its&nbsp;content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר אליהם: שמעו נא</span><span class="font5">, he said to them: “please&nbsp;listen (to my dream).” His reason for telling them of his dream&nbsp;was to explain to them that his being destined for greatness&nbsp;was not due to the way his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">father</span><span class="font5"> preferred him, but seemed&nbsp;to be a destiny decreed by heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37,7. מאלמים אלימים,</span><span class="font5">’^^^ sheaves;” this paralleled the manner in which Joseph later on rose to greatness, by&nbsp;piling up corn in anticipation of a famine from which his&nbsp;foresight and providence would save the Egyptian nation and&nbsp;surrounding countries. Compare 41,49: ויצבור יוסף בר, “Joseph&nbsp;heaped up and stored grain;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותשתחוין לאלומתי</span><span class="font5">, “and you were all prostrating yourselves before my sheaf;” this was a sign that the world&nbsp;would look expectantly to Joseph’s harvest, seeing that he&nbsp;was the sole distributor of grain in all of Egypt to all the&nbsp;people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37,10. ויגער בו אביו</span><span class="font5">, “his father rebuked him;” in spite of his father’s obvious displeasure, he carefully retained this&nbsp;dream in his memory, awaiting future developments if any.&nbsp;He displayed anger only in order to minimise the jealousy of&nbsp;Joseph by his brothers [and because of his arrogance in&nbsp;telling about such dreams. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37,12. לרעות את אחיו את צאן אביהם</span><span class="font5">, “to assist his brothers in tending the flocks of their father.” The reason that there&nbsp;are two dots over the word את in this verse is that the&nbsp;brothers had not gone to the neighbourhood of Sh’chem in&nbsp;order to look after their </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">father’s</span><span class="font5"> flocks, but only to look after&nbsp;their own, and to put more mileage between themselves and&nbsp;Joseph. In other words, that word may be considered as if&nbsp;erased. They had not gone to also tend their father’s flocks.&nbsp;We find a similar construction in Michah 7,14: ירעו בשן וגלעד,&nbsp;“the ones which graze in Bashan and Gilead,” where we&nbsp;would have expected the prophet to say: ירעו את בשן ואת גלעד,&nbsp;“They will graze both in Bashan and in Gilead,” [the prophet&nbsp;continues with the words: “as in the olden days,” (when&nbsp;things were better).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to interpret the word את in our verse to mean that the brothers had gone to let the flocks graze in a&nbsp;place where there was ample virgin (not privately owned&nbsp;grazing land), or that it means to let their own as </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">well</span><span class="font5"> as their&nbsp;fathers’ flocks graze there, there is no possible reason to&nbsp;omit the word את, as we always find it in connection with&nbsp;sheep or cattle grazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.13. </span><span class="font5">?</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הלא אחיך רועי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בשכ</span><span class="font5">ם, “are your brothers not tending flocks in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5"> (a dangerous place?) Seeing that&nbsp;they had killed all the males of that town and looted it&nbsp;(Genesis 34,25-29).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[It occurs to this editor that the reason they had chosen to do so was to show their father that they were </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">less</span><span class="font5"> worried&nbsp;about the local population than about Joseph lording it over&nbsp;them.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.14</span><span class="font5">. לך </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נא ראה את שלו</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחיך</span><span class="font5">, “please go and check whether everything is all right with your brothers!” Whenever&nbsp;the word נא appears in the Torah, it must be understood as a&nbsp;request rather than as an order. Yaakov told Joseph that&nbsp;although he hears reports about what the brothers were&nbsp;doing and where, it was no more than good manners that he,&nbsp;Joseph, should go and look them up, seeing that after all he&nbsp;was their brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת שלו</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הצאן</span><span class="font5">, “and check that everything is all right with the flocks.” From this we learn that it is in order or even&nbsp;preferable, to enquire if a person’s business is flourishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישלחהו </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">מעמק</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> חברון</span><span class="font5">, “he took leave of him in the valley below Chevron.” Seeing that Chevron is situated at the top of&nbsp;a mountain, we learn from here that Yaakov accompanied&nbsp;Joseph on the beginning of his journey, and that this is&nbsp;considered no more than good manners for anyone to copy.&nbsp;Our sages consider it as more than good manners, i.e. as a&nbsp;requirement. The subject of their conversation is supposed to&nbsp;have been the laws about how to deal with an anonymous&nbsp;corpse who had clearly been murdered, so that the people&nbsp;nearest to that location need not feel indirectly responsible&nbsp;(Deuteronomy chapter 21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37,17. מזה wo</span><span class="font5">^’they have moved on from here.” They&nbsp;had been grazing their flocks there until recently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37,19. הלזה בא</span><span class="font5">, “has not this one arrived?! (come&nbsp;closer)” (they were surprised that Joseph had dared to follow&nbsp;them all this distance). On the other hand, the word: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">והלאה</span><span class="font5"> is&nbsp;used to describe something that becomes more and more&nbsp;distant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.21.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישמע ראובן ויצילהו מידם, “when Reuven heard this&nbsp;he saved him from them. G’d decided at that moment that&nbsp;because it was Reuven who had made the first move to save&nbsp;Joseph, the cities of refuge in Israel later on would begin with&nbsp;those in the territory allocated to the tribe of Reuven.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 84,15) This is also hinted at in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 4,43: את בצר במישור לראובני, “Bezer in the&nbsp;tableland to the members of the tribe of Reuven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל הבור הזה, </span><span class="font5">“to this pit;” the word אל has been&nbsp;used here instead of the prefix ב. In other words: “into this&nbsp;pit.” We have a similar construction in Numbers 19,6: והשליך&nbsp;אל תוך שרפת הפרה, “and he will throw it </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">into</span><span class="font5"> the fire consuming&nbsp;the cow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">להשיבו אל אביו, </span><span class="font5">“intending to bring him back to his father.” His intentions were good; if you were to ask that even though&nbsp;the pit may have been dry, it most likely served as a lair for&nbsp;all kinds of poisonous snakes etc.? The fact that the Torah&nbsp;writes the unnecessary word: רק</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“empty,” informs us that the&nbsp;brothers had made sure there were no harmful creatures&nbsp;hiding in it either. After Reuven had left, the brothers threw&nbsp;Joseph into another pit which was infested with snakes and&nbsp;scorpions. When the Torah describes Reuven’s shock when&nbsp;he returned to the first pit later and found it empty, that was&nbsp;the pit which he had told his brothers to throw him, into.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את כתונת הפסים</span><span class="font5">, “the striped coat;” because it had&nbsp;been the garment which had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">caused</span><span class="font5"> all the hatred and&nbsp;jealousy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אין בו מים</span><span class="font5">, “there was no water in it;” the Torah&nbsp;mentions this to tell the reader that if the pit had been filled&nbsp;with water the brothers would not have thrown him into it, as&nbsp;it would have been equivalent to drowning him with their own&nbsp;hands. They had already ruled out doing something like that,&nbsp;(verse 27).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישבו</span><span class="font5">, they sat down; some distance away from&nbsp;the pit, in order to eat their midday meal and not to have to&nbsp;listen to his pitiful pleas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מה בצע כי נהרוג את אחינו</span><span class="font5">, “what will it profit us to kill&nbsp;our brother?” They did not consider killing Joseph a&nbsp;worthwhile act of revenge, as all dead people become&nbsp;forgotten in short order, as David has stated explicitly when&nbsp;he said to G’d in Psalms 59,12: “Do not kill them lest my&nbsp;people will forget them, bring them low, instead;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מה בצע</span><span class="font5">, the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 6, states that anyone who blesses Yehudah for having said this (i.e. saving&nbsp;Joseph’s life) is guilty of insulting him instead, because the&nbsp;reason he gave for saving Joseph’s life was not in order to&nbsp;do him a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">favour</span><span class="font5"> but the reverse. He had implied that if killing&nbsp;him would be profitable they would certainly kill him. The only&nbsp;reason why they did not was because they could not see any&nbsp;advantage in it for themselves in doing so. The Torah spells&nbsp;this out in the next phrase:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכסינו את דמו</span><span class="font5">, “first we would have to cover up his blood,” (so that we could not even take credit for our deed.) When&nbsp;one has fought a war and killed one’s enemy, one can boast&nbsp;of being victorious. How could the brothers boast about the&nbsp;absence of Joseph and their part in having accomplished&nbsp;this? Revenge is only sweet when the victor can boast about&nbsp;it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישמעו אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “his brothers listened to him,” i.e.&nbsp;they accepted his logic;” they said that already at the&nbsp;covenant between the pieces between Avraham and G’d in&nbsp;Genesis chapter 15, certain harsh decrees had been&nbsp;revealed as becoming the fate of Avraham’s descendants&nbsp;before they would conquer the land of Canaan and settle in&nbsp;it. Seeing that they were all part of Avraham’s seed, it would&nbsp;be better for them to be sold together with him else the&nbsp;decree would be suffered only by Joseph. (Torah </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shleymah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">by Rabbi Menachem Kasher item 159)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.28.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויעברו אנשים מדינים סוחרים, “in the meantime&nbsp;Midianite merchants had passed by the pit that Joseph had&nbsp;been thrown into and they heard his cries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וימשכו</span><span class="font5">, “they pulled him out;” the Midianites pulled him out of the pit, and proceeded to sell him to the Yishmaelites;&nbsp;the Yishmaelites in turned him over to the Midianites for&nbsp;safekeeping, as they had no immediate use for him. He was&nbsp;then sold to Poptiphar by the Yishmaelites and Midianites&nbsp;jointly. When you understand what happened in this way, all&nbsp;the three verses that describe what happened to Joseph&nbsp;after he was thrown into the pit makes perfect sense. The&nbsp;three verses read as follows: verse 36: The Midianites had&nbsp;sold him to Egypt, specifically to Potiphar.” Chapter 39,1:&nbsp;Potiphar bought him from the Yishmaelites;” chapter 45,4:&nbsp;Joseph speaking: “whom you had sold (me) to Egypt.”&nbsp;Joseph was not concerned with the details but with the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">cause&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">of his being in Egypt. He accuses the brothers of having&nbsp;been the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">cause,</span><span class="font5"> not the actual sellers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן הבור</span><span class="font5">, “from the pit;” his brothers had no knowledge at all of what had happened to Joseph after they had thrown&nbsp;him into the pit. When Reuven came back to the pit and there&nbsp;was no trace of Joseph, all of them thought that some wild&nbsp;animal must have devoured him. They did not Jje to their&nbsp;father. If the brothers themselves had sold him to anyone or&nbsp;any country, they would have made extensive efforts during&nbsp;the 22 years until they travelled to Egypt to find out what had&nbsp;happened to him since. Not only that, if they had had any&nbsp;reason to believe that he might still have been alive, they&nbsp;would not have failed to recognise him when they stood face&nbsp;to face with him. He could not have completely fooled them&nbsp;unless they had long ago become convinced that he was&nbsp;dead. At least they would have recognised him when he&nbsp;blessed Binyamin (43,29) or when he gave Binyamin gifts&nbsp;that were five time larger than the gifts he gave to them.&nbsp;(43,34) Also, the fact that he had seated them at the table in&nbsp;strict accordance with the order of their birth, would have&nbsp;convinced them that he must be their long lost brother. I am&nbsp;convinced that this is the correct sequence of what&nbsp;happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the sequence of events after Joseph was thrown into the pit: while the brothers were&nbsp;still debating among themselves if to sell Joseph to the&nbsp;approaching Yishmaelites, the Midianites had come from a&nbsp;different direction and seen Joseph in the pit and sold him to&nbsp;the Yishmaelites as soon as possible. In order not to be&nbsp;shamed as having left him in the pit while he was crying, they&nbsp;took him out and made him look presentable before handing&nbsp;him over to the Yishmaelites. Following this, the Yishmaelites&nbsp;sold Joseph to the Midianites, who in turn sold him to&nbsp;Potiphar. According to this scenario, Joseph was actually&nbsp;sold no fewer than four times. This would tally with what is&nbsp;written in 39,1 according to which Potiphar bought Joseph&nbsp;from the Yishmaelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To sum up: the brothers sold Joseph to the Midianites; this sale has not been recorded in the Torah as it remained&nbsp;in effect only for an hour or so. The Midianites then sold him&nbsp;to the Yishmaelites; this sale was also not recorded in the&nbsp;Torah seeing that the Yishmaelites resold Joseph as soon as&nbsp;possible and secretly, not at public auction- as they were&nbsp;afraid that the Midianites wished to cancel the sale and sell&nbsp;him to Potiphar instead, getting a much better price. When&nbsp;Potiphar saw Joseph in the possession of the Midianites and&nbsp;realised how handsome a slave this would be, he could not&nbsp;understand why a white person would sell a fellow white&nbsp;skinned person, they usually only sold negroes, although the&nbsp;reverse would have made sense to him. He therefore&nbsp;reasoned that Joseph could not have been born as a slave.&nbsp;Consequently, he demanded an ironclad guarantee that the&nbsp;Midinanites had not kidnapped him. The guarantee that the&nbsp;Midianites furnished was that they brought the Yishmaelites&nbsp;from whom they had purchased Joseph to confirm this for&nbsp;Potiphar. This is why the Torah writes that Potiphar&nbsp;purchased Joseph from the Yishmaelites, who had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">confirmed&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">that they had sold him legitimately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעשרים כסף</span><span class="font5">, “for twenty pieces of silver.” The price sounds extremely cheap, seeing that Joseph was such a&nbsp;handsome young man. We would have to understand this as&nbsp;being due to Joseph’s face reflecting horrific experiences he&nbsp;had undergone recently and from which he did not yet&nbsp;recover. The brothers shared the twenty silver pieces,&nbsp;reportedly each buying himself a pair of new shoes (Amos&nbsp;2,6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of why the Torah mentions the price Joseph was sold for: In Leviticus 27,5, the Torah lists&nbsp;the monetary value of a person who donates the value of&nbsp;such a person to the Temple treasury. The value depends on&nbsp;age and sex. According to what is written there, males&nbsp;between the age of five and twenty are worth 20 shekel;&nbsp;Joseph was 17 years at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 84,18, G’d decreed that because the brothers sold Joseph for 5 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sela’im=20 dinarim,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">they will have to pay a priest 5 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">selaim</span><span class="font5"> to redeem a first born&nbsp;son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">37.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואני אנה אני בא, “as for me in what terrible&nbsp;situation have I gotten myself into?” Why was Reuven more&nbsp;concerned and afraid than the other brothers? On the&nbsp;contrary, the brother who should have been the one most&nbsp;afraid was Yehudah, who had acted as the brothers’ leader&nbsp;until that time!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must therefore say that he was more concerned because his father had treated Joseph as his firstborn, and&nbsp;he, his father’s biological firstborn could have been accused&nbsp;as being negligent in looking after him due to feelings of&nbsp;jealousy. In addition, he had already been guilty of an&nbsp;indiscretion in Bilhah’s bedroom, which had shown his father&nbsp;that he felt aggrieved about his father having favoured&nbsp;Rachel and her children. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> already commented&nbsp;concerning the tales Joseph had been telling to his father, all&nbsp;putting the sons of Leah in a bad light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">37.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שעיר עזים, “a male goat; ”according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> they&nbsp;chose this animal as its blood most closely resembles the&nbsp;colour of human blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When we read in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 57, where the Babylonian general Nebuzaradan is reported of having tried&nbsp;to compare the blood of the hundreds of thousands of Jews&nbsp;he had slain in Jerusalem to that of the prophet of the&nbsp;prophet Zecharyah which had not stopped bubbling after&nbsp;having been stoned inside the Temple (he was also a priest)&nbsp;for having rebuked King Joash (about 150 years </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;Temple was destroyed) and having failed to prove that that&nbsp;blood was human blood, we must assume that this was due&nbsp;to Zecharyah’s blood having become contaminated during all&nbsp;those years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">37.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישלחו את כתונת הפסים, “they sent the striped coat,&nbsp;etc.” the Torah abbreviated here; the full text should have&nbsp;been: “they sent the striped coat to their father, and the&nbsp;messengers who delivered it said: “this is what we found;”&nbsp;the brothers themselves did not want to become associated&nbsp;with the find, so as not becoming suspect in having had&nbsp;anything to do with Joseph’s death. After all, the fact that&nbsp;they had hated Joseph had been common knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;חיה רעה אכלתהו</span><span class="font5">, “a wild beast has eaten him;” for&nbsp;if he had fallen into the hands of robbers they would not have&nbsp;left the striped coat untouched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ימים רבים</span><span class="font5">, “for many days.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the reason why Yaakov suffered this grief was as&nbsp;punishment for the many years that he had not observed the&nbsp;commandment of honouring father and mother. If you were&nbsp;to ask how this is possible, seeing that he had been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">sent&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">away by his father to get himself a wife, the answer is that he&nbsp;was not willing to return home after his mother had sent&nbsp;Rivkah’s nursemaid to tell him that it was safe to come back,&nbsp;as we explained earlier on 35,8 where we have been told&nbsp;about Devorah’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וימאן להתנחם</span><span class="font5">, “he refused to accept consolations;”&nbsp;he felt that he had been guilty for having sent Joseph on this&nbsp;errand in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי ארד אל בני שאולה</span><span class="font5">, the word: אל, usually translated as “to,” in this case means the same as על, “on account of,”&nbsp;Yaakov foresees that he will wind up in his grave, still in&nbsp;mourning over having been the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">cause</span><span class="font5"> of his beloved son’s&nbsp;tragic and premature death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבן* אותו אביו</span><span class="font5">, his father wept over him;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 84,21, this does not refer to Yaakov, about&nbsp;whose mourning we have already read, but refers to&nbsp;Yaakov’s father Yitzchok, who was still alive; according to&nbsp;different opinions quoted there while Yitzchok ostentatiously&nbsp;shared Yaakov’s grief, this was only when he was in the&nbsp;presence of his son. He was aware that Joseph was alive,&nbsp;but did not reveal this to Yaakov, as he felt it was&nbsp;inappropriate to reveal something to Yaakov that G’d&nbsp;apparently had deliberately kept secret from him. The source&nbsp;for this is the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moed Katan</span><span class="font5"> folio 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37,36. והמדנים מכרו אותו אל מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “the Midianites had sold him into Eggypt;” the Torah chooses this wording&nbsp;[instead of mentioning at this point to whom specifically he&nbsp;had been sold, Ed.] as foreshadowing the brothers’ and their&nbsp;descendants having to remain in Egypt for many years in the&nbsp;future. The enslavement and forceful detention of the&nbsp;Israelites inside Egypt commencing after the last of the&nbsp;brothers had died, was an example of G’d meting out&nbsp;punishment fitting the crime that had been committed, in this&nbsp;instance to the children of those who had committed the&nbsp;crime. [Although Joseph had not committed the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> crime,&nbsp;he had been the cause of aj] the crimes that were committed.&nbsp;This still leaves open the question of how Binjamin’s&nbsp;descendants had to be punished. Ed.] AH of the brothers,&nbsp;however learned from the corrupt ways of the Egyptians so&nbsp;that they had to suffer before being found worthy of&nbsp;redemption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “in Egypt;” another example of the word אל being used as meaning: “in,” is Exodus 25,21, ואל הארון תתן&nbsp;את העדות, “and you are to place the testimony (Tablets) </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">inside&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the ark,” as well as Numbers 19,17 as well as Numbers 19,6:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">.אל תוך</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שר הטבחים</span><span class="font5">, “chief of the king’s slaughterers.” He was in fact the chief of the executioners, the death penalty in Egypt&nbsp;being quite common. We find the expression “slaughter”&nbsp;applied to executioners in Psalms 37,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38,1. וירד יהודה מאת אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “Yehudah separated from his brothers;” he could not bear watching the anguish of his&nbsp;father. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here writes that the word וירד, which means: “he&nbsp;descended,” means that he had been deposed from his&nbsp;position of being the brothers’ spokesman and leader by the&nbsp;other brothers. He derives this from the expression: מאת,&nbsp;understanding the meaning of that word as being: על ידי,&nbsp;“through the action of;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You could well ask that seeing that it took only 22 years until the brothers under the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">leadership</span><span class="font5"> of Yehudah went&nbsp;down to Egypt in order to buy grain, how was it possible that&nbsp;during these few years not only did </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bat Shua,</span><span class="font5"> Yehudah’s&nbsp;wife bear him three sons, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Er, Onan,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shelah,</span><span class="font5"> but that two&nbsp;of them had already become married? And a few years after&nbsp;the death of Onan, Yehudah sired twins from his daughter-inlaw Tamar, all before the descent of the brothers to Egypt for&nbsp;the first time? The answer to such questions is that in those&nbsp;times girls and boys were able to both sire and conceive and&nbsp;give birth already at the age of seven. According to a&nbsp;historical text accepted by our sages as accurate and&nbsp;reliable, called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seder olam,</span><span class="font5"> Er, Yehudah’s oldest was born&nbsp;approximately a year after the sale of Joseph. Bat Shua bore&nbsp;Yehudah two more sons in short order, before she died&nbsp;(verse 12). When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Er</span><span class="font5"> was seven years old he married </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tamar.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">When he died and married </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Onan,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Onan</span><span class="font5"> died, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shelah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">was still too young to marry. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tamar</span><span class="font5"> remained a widow in the&nbsp;house of Yehudah for a year before returning to her mother’s&nbsp;home. When two or three more years had passed and she&nbsp;was not allowed to marry </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shelah,</span><span class="font5"> she took matters into her&nbsp;own hands and contrived to become pregnant from a&nbsp;member of Yaakov’s family, her dearest desire, i.e. she&nbsp;became pregnant by her father-in-law, Yehudah. All of this&nbsp;had only taken about 19 years after Yehudah had been&nbsp;deposed and moved away from his brothers. In the&nbsp;meantime, Peretz, one of the twins </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tamar</span><span class="font5"> had born to&nbsp;Yehudah had married at the age of seven and had himself&nbsp;become a father of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chetzron</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chamul,</span><span class="font5"> (Genesis 46,12)&nbsp;all before Yaakov and his family moved down to Egypt after&nbsp;the brothers’ second trip there.

<p><span class="font5">[While this is interesting, this Editor cannot reconcile it with G’d having punished both </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Er</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Onan</span><span class="font5"> at the tender age&nbsp;of 7 or eight years, for having deliberately failed to produce&nbsp;children (38,7 and 10) Where is the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">source</span><span class="font5"> for the culpability&nbsp;of such young children anywhere?

Compare what the woman&nbsp;from Shunem had said </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">(</span><span class="font5">אל </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">תשלה אותי</span><span class="font5">) to Elisha when&nbsp;promised she would have a son, i.e. and the son had died&nbsp;(Kings II 4,28).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וימיתהו</span><span class="font5">, “He killed him.” The sin was that he did not&nbsp;sleep with his wife in such a way that she could become&nbsp;pregnant with his semen. Tamar had remained a virgin even&nbsp;after having been married to Onan, so that Yehudah was not&nbsp;guilty of sleeping with a close relative whose previous&nbsp;marriage had been consummated, so that she would have&nbsp;been forbidden to him on that score. Our author, at this point&nbsp;raises the same question this Editor had raised at the end of&nbsp;38,1, i.e. that they should not have been culpable until the&nbsp;age of 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבם אותה</span><span class="font5">, “he performed a levirate marriage&nbsp;ceremony on her.” This is one of the expressions which can&nbsp;be used positively as well as negatively, i.e. constructively&nbsp;and destructively. Other expressions that are similar are;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">,פארות, תפאר or מסעף פארה, בסעיפות קננו, in this instance it means he lifted marriage restrictions from her so that she&nbsp;could remarry. The same applies to the expression: ויבמה, “he&nbsp;preformed the levirate ritual of marriage for her.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וידע אונן</span><span class="font5">, “Onan realised;” [the author’s problem&nbsp;with this expression is that the term </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ידע</span><span class="font5">, normally refers to&nbsp;something in the past which was known as a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">fact.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.] The&nbsp;author quotes הידוע נדע, “how were we to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">know,</span><span class="font5">” in Genesis&nbsp;43,7 as proof that the term can also be used here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי לא לו יהיה הזרע, </span><span class="font5">“for the child would not be named after him;” according to the plain meaning of the text, זרע is used&nbsp;with the production of a crop in the field, not a human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'והיה אם בא וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and whenever he would engage in marital relations, etc;” he reasoned that if he were to&nbsp;impregnate his wife (the widow of his brother) the result&nbsp;would be that he would at the same time destroy his own&nbsp;ancestral share of the land. For who would then do the&nbsp;plowing and all the other work needed to be performed in the&nbsp;field?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לבלתי נתן זרע לאחיו</span><span class="font5">, “not to provide semen for his brother;” we find similar considerations in the Book of Ruth&nbsp;4,6 when a potential redeemer declined to perform a levirate&nbsp;marriage with Ruth;” [as the latter had not been a Jewess,&nbsp;and a Moabite even, his consideration was not sinful. Ed.]&nbsp;Besides, there was another redeemer willing and anxious to&nbsp;perform such a ritual for her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38,11; כי אמר פן ימות </span><span class="font5">, “for he had said (to himself) ‘”lest he die too;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On this line </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that Yehudah felt that Tamar was one of those women who has a tendency to bring&nbsp;about the death of her husbands. We have a statement to&nbsp;this effect in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> 64 as well as in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ketuvot&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">43, that if two husbands of a woman have died, one risks&nbsp;one’s life if one marries her. Even according to the opinion&nbsp;that such conclusions cannot be drawn unless the same&nbsp;woman had lost three husbands, Yehudah was afraid for the&nbsp;life of his son. The Talmud forbids a potential suitor to marry&nbsp;a woman with such a record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד יגדל שילה</span><span class="font5">, “until Sheylah would have come of age.” Yehudah felt that once Sheylah would mature, he would be&nbsp;wise enough not to repeat the sins of his older brothers who&nbsp;had died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of this paragraph: Yehudah wanted to wait until Sheylah would grow up, in her father’s&nbsp;house by which time, hopefully, Sheylah would have married&nbsp;someone else and would have produced children from such&nbsp;a marriage. Once that had occurred, Yehudah was willing to&nbsp;let Tamar marry him as he would have no reason that his&nbsp;semen would given to Tamar in order to keep alive the name&nbsp;of his deceased brothers, would at the same time destroy his&nbsp;own future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על גוזזי צאנו</span><span class="font5">, “with the shearers of his flocks.” The&nbsp;word על here is used as meaning the same as עם, “with.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עולה תמנתה</span><span class="font5">, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ascending</span><span class="font5"> toward Timnat;” when&nbsp;Yehudah travelled this route it was spiritually uplifting for him&nbsp;(in retrospect) seeing that two righteous people would be&nbsp;born from that union. When Shimshon in Judges 14,1,&nbsp;travelled the same route, this is described as a “descent,” as&nbsp;it eventually led to his being blinded and dying, and we have&nbsp;no record of his having sired any children at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לגוז צאנו</span><span class="font5">, “to shear his sheep.” Tamar deliberately chose a time for this encounter when her father-in-law, Yehudah,&nbsp;would be in good spirits. At such a time one is more prone to&nbsp;fall victim to temptation, especially as at the conclusion of&nbsp;such a shearing there would be a festive meal and much&nbsp;wine would be consumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask how G’d could have agreed that all of the kings of the Davidic dynasty were the result of the&nbsp;illegitimate pairing of Yehudah with his daughter-in-law&nbsp;through Peretz? The answer is that it was better that David&nbsp;would be descended from the daughter of Shem who had&nbsp;been a priest of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> as we know from Genesis chapter&nbsp;14, than that he should be descended through a Canaanite&nbsp;woman, a cursed nation. [The author appears to contradict&nbsp;what he wrote about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bat Shua,</span><span class="font5"> Yehudah’s wife not having&nbsp;been of Canaanite descent. Compare page 281. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, it is erroneous to describe the union between Tamar and Yehudah as </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">sinful</span><span class="font5"> incest, seeing that&nbsp;before the giving of the Torah, when the seven laws only plus&nbsp;circumcision were binding for the descendants of Avraham,&nbsp;one could perform levirate marriages with any relative,&nbsp;including with the father of the deceased brother. (Compare&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span><span class="font5"> Seeing that Yehudah had not allowed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sheylah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">to perform the rites of the levirate marriage on Tamar, she&nbsp;was available to him for that purpose. Once the Torah was&nbsp;given, the rules about the levirate marriages were revamped&nbsp;to apply only to surviving brothers of the deceased. However,&nbsp;even after the Torah was given, the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">practice</span><span class="font5"> of the levirate&nbsp;marriage to other members of the family did not stop. [This&nbsp;editor is not sure whether the author means that after the&nbsp;Torah was given it remained permissible but was not&nbsp;obligatory for other members of the family, or whether what&nbsp;had once been allowed could not be abolished in practice,&nbsp;just as the use of private altars, though forbidden once the&nbsp;Israelites settled in the land of Israel, continued in spite of&nbsp;this, and it took until 100 years before the destruction of the&nbsp;Temple to eradicate that practice. Ed.] What Boaz did with&nbsp;Ruth is an example of this practice hundreds of years after&nbsp;the Torah had been given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותכס בסעיף</span><span class="font5">, “she wrapped her veil so as to cover&nbsp;her face.” This was not something that widows used to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויחשבה לזונה כי כסתה פניה</span><span class="font5">, “he assumed that she&nbsp;was a harlot because she had covered her face.” She had&nbsp;only done this when he was approaching, in order that he&nbsp;could not recognise her. The letter ח in the word ויחשבה, is&nbsp;vocalised with a semi-vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.17. אם תתן ערבון</span><span class="font5">, “if you will leave an item as guarantee.” This is an abbreviated verse, which should have&nbsp;concluded with the words: “then I will accept your&nbsp;proposition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;חותמך פתילך</span><span class="font5">, “your signet ring and your cord;”&nbsp;these were both items that he could not be without for any&nbsp;length of time. He needed the signet ring for confirming any&nbsp;transactions, and the cord to tie up the sheep. (The third&nbsp;item, his staff, was less important as he was in his prime.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38,24. זנתה תמר כלתך</span><span class="font5">, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has committed an act of infidelity.” She observed the norms of a&nbsp;woman awaiting the levirate marriage, and therefore was out&nbsp;of bounds to any other male pending the resolution of her&nbsp;problematic marital status. She would be released only if her&nbsp;prospective “redeemer” refused to honour this obligation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וגם הנה הרה, </span><span class="font5">“and she is also visibly pregnant.” She can no longer hide her condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמר יהודה</span><span class="font5">, “Yehudah, acting as judge ruled;” was there no one more qualified to sit in judgment of Tamar than her&nbsp;father-in-law? Both Yitzchok and Yaakov were still alive! The&nbsp;fact is that they all sat in judgment of her. The reason why&nbsp;Yehudah was the first one to announce his opinion was&nbsp;because according to the rules of Jewish law when sins or&nbsp;crimes involving capital punishment are discussed the most&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">junior</span><span class="font5"> of the judges is asked for his vote first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוציאה ותשרף</span><span class="font5">, “take her outside so that she will be burned to death!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that Tamar was the&nbsp;daughter (offspring) of Shem who had been a priest, and the&nbsp;Torah prescribes the death penalty by burning for women of&nbsp;priestly descent if they are found as having committed incest&nbsp;before marriage while betrothed. (Leviticus 21,9). In this&nbsp;particular instance, Tamar had not legally been betrothed to&nbsp;anyone, so that even after the Torah had been given she&nbsp;would not have been guilty of a capital offence. However, in&nbsp;those days people imposed severe penalties for infidelity in&nbsp;order to act as deterrent to eventual sinners. Besides, as&nbsp;pointed out, Tamar’s ancestor had been deprived of the title&nbsp;“priest” after when Avraham had defeated the four mighty&nbsp;kings of his era he blessed both Avraham and G’d but&nbsp;committed a fatal error by naming Avraham ahead of naming&nbsp;G’d. (Compare Genesis 14,19-20) Nonetheless, (assuming&nbsp;Tamar was Shem’s his real daughter she would have been&nbsp;quite old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Shem </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">died</span><span class="font5"> in the year 2156 or 2157 B.C.E. having been born in the year 1556-7 B.C.E., and Yehudah, Tamar’s&nbsp;father-in-law was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">born</span><span class="font5"> in 2186 or 2185 B.C.E. At the time&nbsp;Shem was deprived of his status as a priest Avraham was&nbsp;between 75 and 87 years old, seeing that he had been born&nbsp;in the years 1948 B.C.E. If Tamar had been alive, then it&nbsp;does not require a mathematician to figure out how old a lady&nbsp;Tamar must have been when Yehudah selected her as his&nbsp;daughter-in-law for his son Er. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avodah Zarah,</span><span class="font5"> folio 36) claim that even if Tamar had not been a daughter of Shem&nbsp;she would have deserved the death penalty if she had&nbsp;committed adultery with someone other than a partner in a&nbsp;levirate marriage ceremony. This is based on the assumption&nbsp;that she would have been a Canaanite. Even though Shem&nbsp;was dead, the court established by him continued to function&nbsp;after his demise. The court continued to be named after its&nbsp;founder. If you were to say that if Tamar was guilty of the&nbsp;death penalty then so was her partner Yehudah, we would&nbsp;have to answer that in that era an adult surviving would&nbsp;perform the levirate marriage rites, but if only brothers who&nbsp;were minors were available, the father would perform that&nbsp;duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38,25. והיא שלחה</span><span class="font5">, “and she had sent;” the word is&nbsp;spelled with the letter י, [although usually we find it spelled&nbsp;with the letter ו, just like its masculine counterpart הוא, “he.”&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38,26. צדקה ממני</span><span class="font5">, “she is more righteous than I;” why did&nbsp;Yehudah add the word: ממני? The meaning is as follows:&nbsp;whereas both she and I indulged our libido, I did it for a&nbsp;merely physical gratification, whereas she was intent on&nbsp;becoming the mother of a member of the family of Avraham,&nbsp;Yitzchok and a Yaakov. I considered her as a potentially bad&nbsp;omen, two of her husbands having died on her, whereas her&nbsp;entire purpose was to bring life into the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי על כן</span><span class="font5">, “because of this;” if I had not withheld her rightful husband, my son Sheylah from her because I had&nbsp;been afraid that he too would deliberately fail to impregnate&nbsp;her, she would not have felt forced to take such a drastic&nbsp;step in order to become part of my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: “her righteousness is rooted in me; if I were to convict her of the death penalty, I would be&nbsp;punishing myself; [by killing the son she is about to bear for&nbsp;me. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יסף עוד לדעתה</span><span class="font5">, “and he did not stop having marital relations with her,” seeing that originally I had intended to&nbsp;perform the levirate marriage ritual with her,” as explained on&nbsp;verse 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators claim that in that era the only valid marriage ceremony was for the parties concerned sleeping&nbsp;together. Such “sleeping” together was legal as a form of&nbsp;marriage </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> if the manner in which it was performed was&nbsp;the generally accepted method, i.e. the male ejaculating his&nbsp;semen into the female vagina while in the ‘missionary’&nbsp;position. Seeing that this was so, Tamar had never been&nbsp;married, as both Yehudah’s sons had not consummated the&nbsp;marriage. She was therefore legally married to Yehudah,&nbsp;who had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span><span class="font5"> been her father-in-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of the words: ולא יסף; “he </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never </span><span class="font5">again had marital relations with Tamar again, as he was&nbsp;afraid she would cause death to any husband. [When he had&nbsp;done it the first time, Yehudah had thought he was sleeping&nbsp;with a harlot. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another explanation of the meaning of these words: he did not sleep with her again as he was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ashamed</span><span class="font5"> to do so&nbsp;seeing that he was her father-in-law. This is based on the&nbsp;grammatical nuance that if it were to mean that he never&nbsp;stopped to sleep with her, [i.e. treated her as his wife, Ed.]&nbsp;the word לדעתה, with the prefix ל, would not make sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38,27. והנה תאומים בבטנה</span><span class="font5">, “and here there were twins in her womb.” The midwife noticed this already before Tamar&nbsp;had commenced to give birth. This is why she had a means&nbsp;of identification ready to make sure the firstborn would be&nbsp;identified as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והנה יצא אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “and here suddenly his brother&nbsp;emerged.” Seeing that future kings would claim Tamar as&nbsp;their original matriarch, it was important to know which was&nbsp;the older. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 85,13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פרץ</span><span class="font5">, this name was given to the twin whose </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">head</span><span class="font5"> came out first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרא שמו זרח</span><span class="font5">, “he named him </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zerach”.</span><span class="font5"> He was&nbsp;reddish skinned, and the word זרח appears in that sense in&nbsp;Kings II 3,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויוסף הורד מצרימה</span><span class="font5">, “meanwhile Joseph had been&nbsp;transported toward Egypt;” before the first Israelite became&nbsp;enslaved the eventual redeemer had been born. Peretz who&nbsp;was destined to become the ancestor of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mashiach</span><span class="font5"> was&nbsp;born, and only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> that does the Torah </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">report</span><span class="font5"> about Joseph&nbsp;becoming a slave in Egypt. [Joseph clearly had been brought&nbsp;to Egypt about 21 years earlier, as we demonstrated in our&nbsp;commentary on Genesis 38,1. Ed.] Joseph was the first&nbsp;Israelite to become enslaved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39.2. ויהי ה' את יוסף</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hashem</span><span class="font5"> was with Joseph;” he required Divine assistance in order to insulate him against&nbsp;the temptation to adopt the corrupt ways of that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,6. כי אם הלחם אשר הוא אוכל</span><span class="font5">, “except for the food he used to eat.” We have learned already in Genesis 43,32, that&nbsp;the kind of food that Hebrews ate was considered as an&nbsp;abomination by the Egyptians; it is therefore understandable&nbsp;that Potiphar would not allow Joseph to prepare food in an&nbsp;Egyptian kitchen. In Isaiah 30,7 the prophet speaking in the&nbsp;name of the Lord, describes the Egyptians in derogatory&nbsp;terms. In their </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">haughtiness,</span><span class="font5"> they looked down on all other&nbsp;nations, on Hebrews especially. [This is also clear from the&nbsp;way Mrs Potiphar refers to Joseph as a lowly sub-human&nbsp;category of being; (39,17).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: Potiphar entrusted everything to Joseph, the only thing he found fault with was his eating&nbsp;habits; we know the prejudice the Egyptians harboured&nbsp;against the Semites on account of that from Genesis 43,32.&nbsp;They could not bring themselves to eat at the same table as&nbsp;the Hebrews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,9. וחטאתי לאלוקים, </span><span class="font5">“and I would commit a sin against G’d;” even if the matter will remain concealed from human&nbsp;beings, G’d sees everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,11. ויהי כהיום</span><span class="font5">, “it was on a day no different from any&nbsp;other day;” this short phrase has been inserted here as in&nbsp;praise of Joseph, the righteous person, and as condemnation&nbsp;of the cursed person. In a cultured society, marital&nbsp;intercourse is an activity reserved for the night, to be&nbsp;performed in darkness; the wife of Potiphar demanded from&nbsp;Joseph that he engage not only in infidelity to his master and&nbsp;to G’d, but that he do so in broad daylight. Seeing that&nbsp;Joseph could not have foreseen such a demand by his&nbsp;mistress, he can certainly not be faulted to have gone about&nbsp;his daily routine on that day just as on any other day.&nbsp;Regardless of this, she tried to disrobe him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to Rabbi Yishmael, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pessikta zutrata)</span><span class="font5"> that day was the day on which the Nile used to flood its banks to&nbsp;irrigate the fields; that day was a kind of joyous festival,&nbsp;everyone participating in the festivities. Mrs Potiphar and&nbsp;Joseph chose not to participate in those activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,12. ויעזב את בגדו אצלי</span><span class="font5">, “he left his outer garment in my hands;” in preparation of raping me. He was not able o&nbsp;retrieve it until I started yelling, when he decided to flee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,20. ויתנהו אל בית הסוהר</span><span class="font5">, “he put him in (the) jail.” He was not guilty of the death penalty as there had been no&nbsp;witness to the alleged rape attempt. In such cases the&nbsp;standard penalty was to be incarcerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אסורי המלך, </span><span class="font5">“the King’s prisoners;” the spelling here is with the letter ו, although we are to read the word as if it had&nbsp;been written with the letter י instead of the letter ו. We found&nbsp;an interesting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> according to which when Joseph was&nbsp;brought before the King, the angel Gavriel, having assumed&nbsp;the guise of a human being said to the King: “if it pleases&nbsp;Your Majesty may the garments of both the accused and the&nbsp;accuser be examined for evidence. If the woman’s garment&nbsp;show tears it is clear that the accused has tried to rape her. If&nbsp;only Joseph’s clothing has been torn, it is clear that his&nbsp;mistress attempted to seduce him by force. Gavriel’s&nbsp;suggestion was accepted and that was the reason why&nbsp;Joseph was not convicted of the death penalty. He could not&nbsp;be released unconditionally as it would have been too&nbsp;embarrassing for the wife of a highly placed minister at&nbsp;Pharaoh’s Court to have been declared a liar. He was judged&nbsp;by a court of the priests of Egypt, and out of gratitude for this,&nbsp;Joseph did not confiscate the lands of the priests during the&nbsp;years of the famine. (compare 47,22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40,1. חטאו משקה מלך מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “the cup bearer and the baker of the King of Egypt committed a transgression. The&nbsp;former had mixed water in the king’s cup, the latter had&nbsp;mixed some stones in the dough of the King’s bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the former was guilty of allowing a fly to settle on the brim of the king’s cup, whereas the latter&nbsp;had overlooked a small pebble in the flour used to bake the&nbsp;King’s bread. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabba</span><span class="font5"> 88,1 where this&nbsp;subject is discussed)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40,3. ויתן אותם במשמר בית שר הטבחים, “</span><span class="font5">He placed them&nbsp;under protective custody in the house of the chief of the&nbsp;executioners.” This was the customary place where prisoners&nbsp;whose crime carried the death penalty if proven guilty would&nbsp;be placed pending judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;איש כפטרון חלומו</span><span class="font5">, “Each one interpreted his dream&nbsp;in accordance with what he thought was applicable to his&nbsp;personality,” as opposed to interpretations that seemed&nbsp;irrelevant. [As a result they were very disturbed. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והנה זועפים</span><span class="font5">, “and they looked very distressed.” As&nbsp;they considered themselves innocent in accordance with&nbsp;their dreams, they did not understand why they were still in&nbsp;jail, and considered appealing to Pharaoh who might have&nbsp;forgotten about them. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">This</span><span class="font5"> caused their distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ופוטר &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אין אותו</span><span class="font5">,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeing that they were held</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">incommunicado with the outside world, they had no one who could bring their plight to Pharaoh’ attention, or at least to&nbsp;consult with any of the professional sorcerers of Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">?הלא לאלו־הים פתרונים</span><span class="font5">, “since interpretations of dreams is a matter for G’d, perhaps He has decreed that I could&nbsp;interpret it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בעוד שלשת ימים</span><span class="font5">, “within another three days;” the&nbsp;reason why Joseph felt that the events foreshadowed were&nbsp;to occur so soon, was that in the cup-bearer’s dream the&nbsp;development of the budding grapes to becoming wine were&nbsp;described as being so rapid. He therefore also took his cue&nbsp;from the cup-bearer’s dream to interpret the solution to the&nbsp;baker’s dream to become evident within three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והשיבך</span><span class="font5">, “he will restore you;” the letter ו in this word is vocalised with a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach</span><span class="font5"> (instead of a semi-vowel sh’va and&nbsp;the letter ה with an abbreviated </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">40.14.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי אם זכרתני</span><span class="font5">, “if you would only remember me;” he&nbsp;meant that if the cup bearer would bring his plight to&nbsp;Pharaoh’s attention, perhaps he would reopen his case, as a&nbsp;result of which he would be released seeing that he had&nbsp;been completely innocent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40.15. כי גונב גונבתי מארץ העברים</span><span class="font5">, “for I have been kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews;” Joseph merited&nbsp;being buried in the land of Israel because he was proud to&nbsp;acknowledge that he was a Hebrew. Moses, on the other&nbsp;hand, who had allowed the daughters of Yitro to describe him&nbsp;as an Egyptian, was denied that privilege. (Compare Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">2,19.) [This editor has never understood this, as at the time described in that verse, Moses was still at the watering&nbsp;troughs and could not have heard it. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40,16. כי טוב פתר</span><span class="font5">, “that he had predicted something positive, and he believed him;” his reasoning had been that if&nbsp;someone interprets untruthfully, he does not take a chance to&nbsp;be called a liar after three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישב את שר המשקים, </span><span class="font5">“he restored the chief of the&nbsp;cup-bearers;” because his crime had been unavoidable,&nbsp;something beyond human control. Who can prevent a fly&nbsp;from parking on the rim of a cup?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת שר האופים תלה</span><span class="font5">, “but he hanged the chief of the&nbsp;bakers.” The pebble that had been found in the king’s&nbsp;breakfast roll was due to negligence by one of his underlings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא זכר שר המשקים את יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “but the chief of the&nbsp;cup bearers did not remember Joseph. Since he did not bring&nbsp;Joseph’s plight to Pharaoh’s attention as soon as he had&nbsp;been released, he </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">forgot</span><span class="font5"> him totally, erased him from his&nbsp;memory</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Miketz</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,1. ויהי מקץ</span><span class="font5">, “it was at the end of;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> writes that the meaning of this word corresponds to Onkelos’ translation, i.e.&nbsp;“at the end,” as it does always. If you examine the Hebrew&nbsp;language closely you will find that this word does not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">always&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">mean “end,” as for instance when Joseph in Genesis 47,2&nbsp;presents </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">some</span><span class="font5"> of his brothers to Pharaoh and the word&nbsp;chosen for “some of” is מ-קצה. We also find this word in&nbsp;Jeremiah 34,14, meaning: “at the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">beginning</span><span class="font5"> of seven years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">שנתים ימים, “two years;” these years are counted from the day that the chief cupbearer was released from&nbsp;imprisonment. In other words, the word: ימים, both here and&nbsp;in quite a few other instances, means the same as שנים. If the&nbsp;Torah had used the word שנתים, which also means “two&nbsp;years,” I might have thought that it could have been as little&nbsp;as one year plus a day, as we find the years of a king’s rule&nbsp;is described in such a way from the moment the second year&nbsp;of his reign has commenced. The Torah wished us to know&nbsp;that Joseph spent a whole two extra years in jail because the&nbsp;chief of the cupbearers did not keep his promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Had he kept it, it is doubtful that he would ever have become viceroy and that the Egyptians would have been&nbsp;saved from the ravages of the famine. Ed.] From G’d’s point&nbsp;of view he was punished for putting his trust in that cup&nbsp;bearer instead of praying to G’d for his release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the two years were two years that had been added to G’d’s decree for Joseph to spend&nbsp;time in jail. (Compare Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 36) According to&nbsp;the Talmud, Joseph had actually </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">wanted</span><span class="font5"> to sleep with the&nbsp;wife of Potiphar when his father’s image appeared to him and&nbsp;helped him to overcome the temptation. According to the&nbsp;description there, he dug his fingernails into the floor and&nbsp;ejaculated semen by that means. The Talmud continues that&nbsp;he was really meant to sire twelve tribes just as had his&nbsp;father Yaakov, but enough semen escaped through the ten&nbsp;fingernails to preclude him from fulfilling his destiny in that&nbsp;respect. Instead, he spent ten years in jail as penance.&nbsp;Pharaoh’s dream occurred 12 years after he had been jailed.&nbsp;The Torah reports that he was 30 years old when appointed&nbsp;to high office. (verse 46). He had served in Potiphar’s house&nbsp;for a year. Therefore he was in jail for a total of 12 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מן היאור עולות</span><span class="font5">, “rising up from the river Nile;” they&nbsp;had first descended to its banks to drink its waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שבע פרות</span><span class="font5">, “seven cows;” an allusion to the seven&nbsp;years of plenty and the seven years of famine to occur. Cows&nbsp;are relevant animals as they do the ploughing in order for&nbsp;crops to grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותעמודנה אצל הפרות</span><span class="font5">, “they were standing alongside the other cows;” the reason they are described as standing, is&nbsp;that they did not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">immediately</span><span class="font5"> consume the seven fat cows. It&nbsp;was a signal that the famine would not immediately destroy&nbsp;the existing crops, as Joseph told Pharaoh in verse 54: ובכל&nbsp;ארץ מצרים היה לחם, “whereas in the whole land of Egypt there&nbsp;was bread.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקץ פרעה</span><span class="font5">, Pharaoh awoke (at this point) in order to&nbsp;let the message of the dream sink into his consciousness&nbsp;before he would be told of the second half of his dream. The&nbsp;two parts should not be mixed up, and to be understood as a&nbsp;single event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עולות בקנה אחד</span><span class="font5">, “rising on a single stalk;” this was&nbsp;an allusion to plenty, abundance. The message had now&nbsp;become more explicit than in the first half of the dream.&nbsp;Normally, the seven kernels would compete with each other&nbsp;for the nutrients provided by a single stalk. In this dream they&nbsp;did not do so. They were all fully developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושדופות קדים</span><span class="font5">, “and parched by the east wind;” the&nbsp;wind coming from the eastern regions is known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kadim.</span><span class="font5"> It&nbsp;had been heated by the sun from which it blew in, as the sun&nbsp;there had risen earlier. This is alluded to in the expression&nbsp;קדמה מזרחה, (Exodus 27,13). The reason why the “west” in&nbsp;Hebrew is called: מערב, is that when the sun sets in the west&nbsp;it is evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותבלענה השבלים</span><span class="font5">, “the kernels swallowed;” some&nbsp;commentators understand this expression as describing the&nbsp;kernels growing so high that they completely covered the&nbsp;ones which had grown earlier so that they could no longer be&nbsp;seen. The word בלע certainly appears in this sense; of course&nbsp;the word ותבלענה in our verse is not to be understood literally,&nbsp;as G’d does not show people things in dreams which are&nbsp;impossible to occur in reality, such as elephants sliding&nbsp;through the eye of a needle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנה חלום</span><span class="font5">, and Pharaoh realised that what he had seen was in a dream. Whenever a person is dreaming, he believes&nbsp;that the images shown him represent reality, and that is why&nbsp;he reacts to them with different degrees of joy or&nbsp;consternation. As soon as he wakes up, he realises that what&nbsp;had so emotionally disturbed him had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> been a dream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Proof of this statement can be found in Isaiah 29,8: והיה כאשר יחלום הצמא והנה שותה והקיץ ונפשו שוקקה, “like one who is&nbsp;thirsty and dreams that he is drinking, but when he wakes up&nbsp;he finds himself faint and utterly parched.” Pharaoh was&nbsp;meant to react in a similar manner to the cows he saw&nbsp;consuming cows twice their size without gaining weight.&nbsp;However he waited until Joseph had completed his&nbsp;interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators point out that as far as the cows in Paraoh’s dream are concerned, we do not even find that the&nbsp;Torah writes that upon </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">awaking</span><span class="font5"> he realised that this had&nbsp;been only a dream. [as opposed to the dream with the stalks&nbsp;of kernels of grain.] The reason for this is that it does happen&nbsp;in real life occasionally that one cow eats another cow.&nbsp;Kernels of grain consuming other kernels of grain however, is&nbsp;something that is unheard of.” This is why the Torah added&nbsp;the words: “and here it had been a dream,” to describe&nbsp;Pharaoh’s reaction when awaking. Another interpretation of&nbsp;these two words is that Pharaoh now realised that the dream&nbsp;had ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,8. ותפעם רוחו</span><span class="font5">, “His mind was greatly disturbed;” even though in Daniel 2,3 when a dream of Nebuchadnezzar is&nbsp;reported and he described himself as ותפעם רוחי</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">my mind&nbsp;was disturbed,” this was because when the Babylonian&nbsp;soothsayers were called in for consultation, Nebuchadnezzar&nbsp;could not even remember </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">what</span><span class="font5"> he had dreamed, as distinct&nbsp;from here where Pharaoh had a clear recollection of the&nbsp;details of his dream. [According to this view, he therefore had&nbsp;no reason to be so agitated. Ed.] Pharaoh had only forgotten&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">interpretation</span><span class="font5"> of his dream, and when Joseph interpreted&nbsp;it he recalled that he had dreamt this also. This also brought&nbsp;back his experience in jail with Joseph as an interpreter of&nbsp;dreams to the chief of the cup bearers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותפעם</span><span class="font5">, “it became agitated;” there is a difference in meaning between the words: ותפעם and ותתפעם. The former&nbsp;describes an emotion which </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">cannot</span><span class="font5"> be explained as resulting&nbsp;in a definite action by the person so troubled faking his&nbsp;agitation, whereas the reflexive mode ותתפעם, allows for the&nbsp;subject either to take an action as a result of his agitation or&nbsp;to remain passive. The latter is a rule that applies whenever&nbsp;we encounter the use of the reflexive mode. Compare&nbsp;Deuteronomy 29,18: והתברך בלבבו, “he consoles himself by&nbsp;thinking, etc.” There are numerous examples of this. In the&nbsp;case of Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 2,3, the king was in two&nbsp;minds if to reveal the content of what he dreamt, fearing that&nbsp;if he did so, the soothsayers would exploit this to offer each&nbsp;his own interpretation so that he would be forced to choose&nbsp;which to accept without knowing which interpretation to&nbsp;accept. He therefore decided to act as if he had forgotten the&nbsp;content of the dream. Whichever of the soothsayers would&nbsp;both tell him </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">what</span><span class="font5"> he had dreamt, and what it </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">meant</span><span class="font5"> would&nbsp;surely have offered the correct interpretation. That interpreter&nbsp;must have been inspired by G’d Himself. Whatever that&nbsp;interpreter foresaw would happen as a result of having heard&nbsp;my dream, would surely occur in reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pharaoh, on the other hand, who revealed to all what he had dreamt, acted very foolishly, except that he did not&nbsp;threaten to kill the ones who interpreted his dream&nbsp;incorrectly, as did Nebuchadnezzar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויספר פרעה להם את חלומו</span><span class="font5">, Pharaoh told them the contents of his dream.” The reason why Nebuchadnezzar was bound&nbsp;to have forgotten the dream itself as opposed to Pharaoh,&nbsp;[seeing that as it turned out both had received messages.&nbsp;Ed.] was that implementation of Pharaoh’s dream would&nbsp;commence almost immediately, whereas that of&nbsp;Nebuchdnezzar’s dream was long delayed. He would not&nbsp;believe Daniel’s interpretation if he had remembered the&nbsp;dream and told it to Daniel. Only the fact that Daniel proved&nbsp;to even have been privy to his dream itself, convinced him&nbsp;that the interpretation was the true one. Joseph, when&nbsp;interpreting Pharaoh’s dream as being in two stages was that&nbsp;it foreshadowed immediate fulfillment of what he had seen&nbsp;symbolised in his dream. This is why he said: וממהר האלוקים&nbsp;לעשותו, “G’d will hasten to carry out what was in your dream. “</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואין פותר אותם, </span><span class="font5">“and there is no one who can interpret them.” The reason was that Pharaoh’s wizards considered&nbsp;the dreams as two separate dreams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,9. את חטאי</span><span class="font5">, “my sins;” the plural mode the cupbearer chose here was to admit his sins against Pharaoh as well as&nbsp;his sin in not fulfilling his promise to Joseph through his&nbsp;forgetfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,12. נער עברי, עבד</span><span class="font5">, “a Hebrew lad, a slave;” the chief of the cupbearers was afraid that he might become the cause of&nbsp;Joseph being promoted to an elevated status if he&nbsp;succeeded in interpreting Pharaoh’s dreams. Therefore, he&nbsp;mentioned two adjectives that should militate against any&nbsp;promotion for him, a) his youth and inexperience, b) his&nbsp;status as a slave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: he wanted to protect himself against the accusation why he had not come forward before&nbsp;with the information he revealed now. This is why he&nbsp;explained that Joseph had two strikes against him; 1) youth,&nbsp;2) status as slave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,19. דלות ורעות תואר מאד ורקות בשר</span><span class="font5">, “very thin, badly formed, and meatless;” in verse 20,27, both the cows and the&nbsp;stalks that were inferior are described as רקות, instead of as&nbsp;דקות. The reason that Pharaoh’s dream is spelled out twice&nbsp;was as compliment to Joseph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,25. את אשר אלוקים עושה</span><span class="font5">, “that which G’d is about to do etc.;” what He wishes to do in His world He has revealed&nbsp;to Pharaoh, seeing that he is a king and has been charged&nbsp;with looking after his people, He has provided him with a&nbsp;means to do his duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,27. יהיו שבע שני רעב</span><span class="font5">, “will be seven years of famine.” Joseph started with the prediction of the famine </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">first,</span><span class="font5"> as he&nbsp;wanted to show him the problem before revealing the&nbsp;solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,32. ועל השנות החלום</span><span class="font5">, “and concerning the repetition of the dream (in a different guises);” you might ask that the&nbsp;dreams of Joseph that the Torah recorded for us are also&nbsp;repetitions, (and were not fulfilled immediately) but took 22&nbsp;years to be fulfilled? Joseph’s dreams did not occur during&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> night so that their interpretation was not subject to&nbsp;the same rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,34. וחמש את ארץ מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “the overseer should collect a tax of 20% of the harvests of the next seven years to be put&nbsp;at the disposal for the King,” even though during normal&nbsp;years only 10% was set aside for the King’s use, as we know&nbsp;from Samuel I 8,14-15. This advice of Joseph was carried&nbsp;out, as we know from Genesis 47,26: על אדמת מצרים לחומש,&nbsp;“all over the land of Egypt one fifth would be taxed for the&nbsp;king.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,35.את כל אוכל</span><span class="font5">, “all the food;” as far as possible;”&nbsp;(compare verse 57)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אחרי הודיע</span><span class="font5">, “since G’d has informed;” this refers&nbsp;also to what follows, i.e. since G’d has granted Joseph so&nbsp;much wisdom: “you shall be in charge of My palace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.40. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ישק כל עמי</span><span class="font5">, “my people will be mobilised for war at&nbsp;Joseph’s command.” The relevant root-word is נשק,&nbsp;“weaponry.” Compare Psalms 78,9: נושקי רומי קשת, “they rely&nbsp;on the bow and arrow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,42. ויתן אותה על יד יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “he placed it on Joseph’s hand.” Pharaoh said to himself that maybe Joseph’s&nbsp;interpretation etc. was only designed to rid himself of&nbsp;Pharaoh’s supervision. This is why he entrusted him with&nbsp;executive power to observe whether he would work for the&nbsp;benefit of the state. If Joseph accepted this task, he would be&nbsp;convinced that he was loyal and upright, as he would know&nbsp;that failure would bring disastrous consequences for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בגדי שש</span><span class="font5">, “garments made of the finest linen that only the highest dignitaries in the land were allowed to wear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">רביד הזהב</span><span class="font5">, “a golden chain of office;” the word רביד is familiar to us from Proverbs 7,16: מרבדים רבדתי ערשי, “I have&nbsp;decked my couch with covers;” [even more so from Proverbs</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">31,22, מרבדים עשתה לה, שש וארגמן לבושה, “she makes tapestries&nbsp;for herself and is clothed in fine linen and purple.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,42. אני פרעה ובלעדיך</span><span class="font5">, “I am Pharaoh; but apart from this, you are (in charge of everything).” As an example of&nbsp;Joseph’s wide ranging powers, he added: “only by the height&nbsp;of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">my </span><span class="font5">throne will I be bigger than you.” It was necessary to&nbsp;remind Joseph of this, since Pharaoh had handed over to&nbsp;him his signet ring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.44. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא ירים איש את ידו</span><span class="font5">, “no one will dare challenge&nbsp;your authority.” We find a similar expression in connection&nbsp;with (later King) Jerovam, who had dared to challenge the&nbsp;authority of King Solomon and had to flee to Egypt. (Kings I&nbsp;11,27-28)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.45. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתן לו את אסנת בת פוטיפרע</span><span class="font5">, “he gave him (as a&nbsp;wife) Ossnat daughter of Potiphera;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this&nbsp;is the same Potiphar in whose house Joseph had served for&nbsp;a year before his incarceration. If Joseph had married&nbsp;someone of higher rank, he was afraid that his children&nbsp;would be claimed by his former master as slaves, seeing he&nbsp;had owned their father as a slave. When he married his&nbsp;former master’s own daughter, he would be ashamed to say&nbsp;that her children were slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: he married her to prove that he had never slept with her mother as claimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation: Joseph’s wife was called: “the daughter of Potiphar,” only because he had raised her.&nbsp;There was no biological connection with Potiphar. We find&nbsp;something similar in Chronicles I 4,18: אלה בני בתיה בת פרעה,&nbsp;”these were the children of Batyah, daughter of Pharaoh, as&nbsp;pointed out in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah Shleymah</span><span class="font5"> by Rabbi Menachem Kasher&nbsp;item 111 on this verse, quoting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">chapter 38 according to which this was the daughter Dinah&nbsp;who had been raped by Sh’chem, her very name suggesting&nbsp;that she was the product of rape. Having been raised in the&nbsp;house of a high official such as Potiphar, and bearing his&nbsp;name, would help to remove any stigma from her. According&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> Yaakov, after her birth had expelled her, and&nbsp;placed a charm around her neck and hid her among some&nbsp;cactuses and similar prickly plants, so that when found she&nbsp;was named according to the location where she had been&nbsp;found, סנה, “thorn-bush.” The angel Gavriel brought her to&nbsp;Egypt, presented her to the wife of Potiphar where she was&nbsp;raised. When Joseph was paraded after his ascension to&nbsp;power and all the young women of Egypt crowded around&nbsp;him to admire his being so handsome (49,22), and throwing&nbsp;flowers at him, Ossnat, who had no flowers, threw her charm&nbsp;at him. When Joseph took a look at the inscription on that&nbsp;charm, he realised that she was the daughter of his half&nbsp;sister Dinah, and decided to marry her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פוטיפרע</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this was the same man as the one who had been Joseph’s master, but his name has&nbsp;been changed after he had become partially castrated so as&nbsp;to prevent him from carrying out his homo-sexual designs on&nbsp;Joseph. The word פריעה, almost identical with the name given&nbsp;Potiphar here, describes a condition permitting sexual&nbsp;intercourse with females but not with males. Unless you&nbsp;interpreted this in this way, we would not know how Potiphar&nbsp;was able to produce a daughter. Besides, according to the&nbsp;words of his wife who demonstrated to her husband how&nbsp;Joseph had supposedly raped her or tried to rape her, that&nbsp;line would make no sense. (39,19).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,48. אוכל שדה העיר</span><span class="font5">, “he stored inside each city the kind of food had had grown in the vicinity of that city.” By doing&nbsp;this it would be near at hand when the time came for drawing&nbsp;on these supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,50. בטר</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תבא שנת הרעב </span><span class="font5">, “before the first year of the famine commenced.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains the significance of this&nbsp;verse being that marital relations during a famine are&nbsp;prohibited under Jewish law. You could ask that his brother&nbsp;Levi certainly had had marital relations with his wife during&nbsp;the famine, else how could his daughter Yocheved have&nbsp;been born during the second year of the famine when&nbsp;Yaakov travelled down to Egypt? (According to our tradition)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must therefore presume that the reason that Joseph abstained during that period was because he realised that&nbsp;his family went through a difficult time, not having any&nbsp;supplies until they replenished them by buying grain in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.53. ותכילנה, </span><span class="font5">“they came to an end;” this unusual&nbsp;expression for describing the end of something is based on&nbsp;כלולות יופי, “they were </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">completely</span><span class="font5"> beautiful, because fully&nbsp;sated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.54. ותחילנה</span><span class="font5">, from חולניות, becoming weak, sickly; when the supply of available food ran out people naturally&nbsp;began to lose weight and become weakened as soon as the&nbsp;famine started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובכל ארץ מצרים היה לחם, </span><span class="font5">“but in the whole land of Egypt there was bread. (food),” as opposed to the countries&nbsp;adjacent to Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41.54. ויצעק העם לפרעה ללחם</span><span class="font5">, “the people cried out to Pharaoh for food.” They wanted him to sell them food which&nbsp;they knew had been stored. It was below the king’s dignity to&nbsp;become a merchant selling food; in order to remain in good&nbsp;standing with his people, he sent them to Joseph who would&nbsp;tell them how to act. He would share out food according to&nbsp;prices determined by him, the proceeds being delivered to&nbsp;Pharaoh’s treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">41,57. לשבור אל יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “to buy grain </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font5"> Joseph;” the unusual construction here, when we would have expected&nbsp;the Torah to write: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לשבור </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">מיוסף</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">“to Joseph in order to buy&nbsp;food;” is similar to construction Genesis 30,39: אל המקלות&nbsp;where the word אל also means: “from,” “as a result of,”&nbsp;(seeing the sticks that had been peeled by Yaakov).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42.1.וירא יעקב שיש שבר במצרים </span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov heard (not saw) that there was grain in Egypt;” (this was not a spiritual&nbsp;revelation, but he had heard from people returning from&nbsp;there.) When telling his sons about it, he therefore used the&nbsp;words: “I have </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">heard</span><span class="font5"> that there is grain to be had in Egypt.”&nbsp;The word ראה meaning “hearing,” instead of “seeing,” is not&nbsp;unique; we find it for instance in Exodus 20,15, where the&nbsp;Torah writes: וכל העם ראו את </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הקולות, “</span><span class="font5">all the people </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">saw</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;thunder,” when the meaning clearly is that all the people&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">heard</span><span class="font5"> the thunder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">?למה תתראו</span><span class="font5">, “why should you stand out (as being different)?” Why do you wish to create the impression that&nbsp;only you have plenty to eat and do not need to buy grain in&nbsp;Egypt? It would make everyone else jealous of you! This is&nbsp;the way the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Taanit,</span><span class="font5"> folio 10 interprets this phrase.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds that he heard from others that the meaning of the&nbsp;word תתראו is “to be weakened,” and that it appears in this&nbsp;sense in Proverbs 11,25: ומרוה הוא יורא, “and he who waters&nbsp;(others) will also be irrigated.” According to this, both the&nbsp;words מרוה and יורא in that verse ought to be understood as&nbsp;having been written with the letter א at the end. The idea is&nbsp;that Yaakov did not want his sons to create the impression&nbsp;(erroneous according to some) that they had ample supplies&nbsp;which they had not shared with their neighbours. This is&nbsp;supposed to be so, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">although</span><span class="font5"> the two explanations are&nbsp;contradictions in themselves, one suggesting abundance,&nbsp;and the other, weakness for lack of food. (As a result one of&nbsp;these interpretations would appear to be wrong. Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our author, by quoting Exodus 27,3: דשן לדשנו, as well as Job 31,12: שרש תשרש, plus more examples, demonstrates&nbsp;that this would not be the only place where the same word&nbsp;occurs in opposite meanings depending on the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">context</span><span class="font5"> in&nbsp;which they appear. The best known example is the use of the&nbsp;word משביר, which appears in our portion both as meaning:&nbsp;“selling” and “buying;” it simply means: “trading in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42.5. בתוך הבאי</span><span class="font5">ם, “they intermingled with others going to&nbsp;Egypt for the same purpose, disguising themselves so as not&nbsp;to draw attention to themselves as they had been&nbsp;commanded to do by their father, when he had said: למה&nbsp;תתראו, “why do you draw attention to yourselves?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויוסף הוא השליט על הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “and Joseph was the one</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">who was the sole ruler of the land.” In spite of having such a demanding position, [which one would expect would force&nbsp;him to delegate the task of presiding over grain sales, he was&nbsp;the one who presided personally over all these sales. Ed.] He&nbsp;collected the money from all the customers. The reason that&nbsp;he did this was so that when, as he expected, his brothers&nbsp;would show up, he would immediately be aware of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתנכר אליהם</span><span class="font5">, “he acted like a stranger to them.” His&nbsp;reasoning was that if he would reveal his identity, they would&nbsp;say to him: “if you expect us not to reveal </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> true identity,&nbsp;you are also sworn not to reveal our true identity.”&nbsp;Alternately, his reasoning was that he would frighten them&nbsp;into trying to flee. As a result, he would cause his father&nbsp;untold additional anguish. It would therefore be better that&nbsp;they would appear before him because they had no choice&nbsp;not to do so, as they needed the supplies that only he could&nbsp;provide. This would provide him with the chance to force&nbsp;them to bring Binyamin down to Egypt and he would detain&nbsp;him there. As a result, the fact that he was Joseph would&nbsp;become known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויכר יוסף את אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “Joseph recognised his brothers;”&nbsp;because they addressed each other with their names, and he&nbsp;understood both their names and the language in which they&nbsp;spoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והם לא הכירוהו</span><span class="font5">, “but they did not recognise him;” one reason was that he had grown a beard that he did not have&nbsp;when he was sold. Secondly, his name had been changed.&nbsp;Thirdly, he now spoke Egyptian and he used an interpreter,&nbsp;making believe that he did not understand Hebrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42,12. כי ערות הארץ באתם לראות</span><span class="font5">, “for you came to seek out the country’s nakedness.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this that&nbsp;the brothers had used ten different border crossing points&nbsp;when entering Egypt. If you want to know how Joseph knew&nbsp;all this, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash Tanchumah</span><span class="font5"> explains that Joseph had issued&nbsp;3 decrees. 1) No slave was to be allowed entry into Egypt in&nbsp;order to buy grain on behalf of his master. 2) No person was&nbsp;allowed to walk behind two donkeys; 3) no one was to be&nbsp;allowed entry unless he registered with his own name and&nbsp;that of his father and grandfather. Moses collected this&nbsp;information day after day, and examined if any of his brothers&nbsp;had registered. Seeing his brothers had entered at ten&nbsp;different border crossings, be had knowledge of this, and&nbsp;could challenge them, so that they would reveal in self&nbsp;defense that they were all brothers of one father. Their father&nbsp;had instructed them not to draw attention to themselves;&nbsp;when each one came to the border crossing and the border&nbsp;guard would ask about his name and the name of his father&nbsp;and grandfather, he would answer truthfully: Reuven son of&nbsp;Yaakov and grandfather Yitzchok.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42,20</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויעשו כן, </span><span class="font5">“they did so.” They agreed with Joseph’s conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42,22. ויען ראובן</span><span class="font5">, “Reuven replied to them;” originally&nbsp;Joseph had intended to keep Reuven, who was the oldest,&nbsp;as hostage pending Binyamin’s coming to Egypt. It is&nbsp;customary that when a number of people are guilty of a crime&nbsp;that the senior member of the group is punished first. When&nbsp;Joseph overheard their conversation and found out for the&nbsp;first time that it had been Reuven who had tried to save him,&nbsp;he changed his mind and kept Shimon as a hostage instead,&nbsp;as he was the second oldest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42,28. מה זאת עשה אלוקים לנו</span><span class="font5">, “what is the meaning of this that G’d has done to us?” They could understand that&nbsp;their brother had been incarcerated as punishment for what&nbsp;they had done to Joseph, when they had not responded to&nbsp;his pleas. They knew that it is the custom of G’d to match the&nbsp;punishment to the crime/sin. But they could not figure out&nbsp;how G’d could </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">punish</span><span class="font5"> them by having their money </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">returned&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">to them. This would be the reverse of punishment, as the&nbsp;sinner goes rewarded instead of punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת הארץ תסחרו, “</span><span class="font5">and then you can carry on trade&nbsp;freely.” This is not what </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Joseph</span><span class="font5"> had said to them, but this is&nbsp;how they interpreted what he had meant as an incentive for&nbsp;them to bring Biyamin with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את צרורות כספיהם</span><span class="font5">, “each man’s bundle of money;”&nbsp;this is the only time that either silver (money) or gold (coins)&nbsp;are described in the plural mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">42,38. וקרהו אסון</span><span class="font5">, “and some mishap would befall him;” the letter ו in the word קרהו has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shuruk,</span><span class="font5"> whereas&nbsp;the letter ק has the semi-vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">43,11. מעט צרי, </span><span class="font5">“a little balsam;” something not available&nbsp;in Egypt. We have read that caravans used to transport this&nbsp;material to Egypt in Genesis 37.25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">43,15. ויעמדו לפני יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “they stood facing Joseph.” They did not speak to him at all at that time, but they saw him from&nbsp;a distance. Joseph did not speak to them as he was&nbsp;emotionally overcome with compassion when seeing&nbsp;Binyamin. The brothers mistakenly interpreted Joseph’s&nbsp;silence as anger over the money which had been found in&nbsp;their bags (and which would have been interpreted as having&nbsp;been stolen from him or his servants.) This is why they were&nbsp;frightened and interpreted Joseph’s behaviour as a prelude&nbsp;to new accusations and worse, as spelled out with the words:&nbsp;להתגולל עלינו ולהתנפל עלינו, “to turn it against us and to attack&nbsp;us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">43,18.להתגולל</span><span class="font5">, an expression similar to: בגלל, i.e. “to turn around” the fact that our money had been found in our bags&nbsp;as a pretext to attack us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת חמורינו</span><span class="font5">, “together with our donkeys.” They reasoned that if only we had been brought to Joseph’s private&nbsp;residence we would not be so worried; but the fact that we&nbsp;were brought here </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">together</span><span class="font5"> with our donkeys, is proof that&nbsp;something else is afoot, i.e. an accusation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">43,20. לשבר אוכל</span><span class="font5">, “to buy food;” the letter ב here is vocalised with the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chataf kametz,</span><span class="font5"> an abbreviated&nbsp;vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">43.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירחץ פניו</span><span class="font5">, “he washed his face;” seeing that he&nbsp;had to sit with them and to stand up after the meal, and they&nbsp;would otherwise see that he had been crying, unless he&nbsp;washed his face immediately. But earlier, in 42,24, where he&nbsp;did not have to face his brothers except very briefly, he did&nbsp;not feel the need to wash his face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">43.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תועבה למצרים</span><span class="font5">, “for it was something detestable&nbsp;for Egyptians;” Egyptians detested eating at the same table&nbsp;as aliens, as they felt that they were a superior race and&nbsp;everyone else was way inferior. We have an example of this&nbsp;in Isaiah 30,7 as well as in verse 39 here, i.e. ומצרים הבל וריק&nbsp;יעזרו לכן קראתי לזאת רהב לשבת, the help of Egypt I call empty&nbsp;and vain, I call this a disgrace and chagrin to dwell alongside&nbsp;them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">43.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הבכור כבכורתו</span><span class="font5">, “the firstborn according to the&nbsp;mother he was the firstborn of.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains: when it came&nbsp;to seating Binyamin, seeing that he did no longer have a&nbsp;mother, he seated him according to his being the youngest&nbsp;as the brothers had told him on their first visit. Joseph&nbsp;thought that the mothers of the others were still alive,&nbsp;[although we know from Yaakov’s remarks on his deathbed&nbsp;that Leah had already been buried by him in the cave of&nbsp;Machpelah (Genesis 49,31). The brothers who were not&nbsp;firstborns seated themselves in the order of their seniority,&nbsp;seeing that it does not say concerning them that ויושיב אותם,&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">he seated</span><span class="font5"> them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויתמהו האנשים</span><span class="font5">, “the men were amazed;” clearly this does not refer to the line: וישבו לפניו, “they sat before him;” their&nbsp;amazement was at the separation between the separate&nbsp;seating arrangement between 1) himself, 2) the Egyptians,&nbsp;and 3) themselves, the Hebrews. What they could not&nbsp;understand was why Joseph was seated by himself seeing&nbsp;that in their opinion he was also an Egyptian. They&nbsp;concluded that he must be of a different people or religion&nbsp;altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">43,34. וישא משאת מאת פניו</span><span class="font5">, “portions were brought from him to them;” they were all served portions approved by&nbsp;Joseph as appropriate;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ותרב משאת בנימין, “it turned out that Binyamin’s portion was greater than that of the other brothers as Joseph had so&nbsp;instructed the waiters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישכרו עמו</span><span class="font5">, “they drank wine with him and got drunk;” at that time drinking wine with gentiles if that wine had not&nbsp;specifically been prepared for idolatrous purposes was not&nbsp;yet forbidden for Hebrews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">44.2. תשים בפי אמתחת הקטן </span><span class="font5">“place at the top of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">travelling bag of the junior brother!” The reason that Joseph prepared to indict Binyamin as being guilty of theft, was&nbsp;because he had not recognised him as his brother, seeing&nbsp;that at the time Joseph had been sold he was only about 10&nbsp;years old and had not yet grown a beard. He said to himself:&nbsp;“maybe this lad is not even my brother and they brought&nbsp;some orphan they picked up somewhere in order to deceive&nbsp;me. If I indict him and he is not their brother they will not&nbsp;interfere and will abandon him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">44.3. הבקר אור והאנשים </span><span class="font5">שולחו, “it was already bright daylight, and the men had been sent off;” even though most&nbsp;of the people who had come to buy grain rose very early in&nbsp;the morning to start on their return journey, Joseph did not&nbsp;see them off until was daylight, as he was afraid they would&nbsp;kill the official he sent after them in order to search their&nbsp;belongings. If this would occur when nobody was about yet,&nbsp;they would be able to get away with this without fearing&nbsp;detection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">44.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לאשר על ביתו</span><span class="font5">, “to the manager of his household;”&nbsp;according to a comment in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah,</span><span class="font5"> this was&nbsp;Menashe, Joseph’s older son, and seeing that the brothers&nbsp;rent their garments on account of the false accusations&nbsp;leveled at them by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menashe,</span><span class="font5"> the latter’s ancestral territory in&nbsp;the land of Israel was also torn apart, most of it being on the&nbsp;east bank of the river Jordan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">44,5. והוא נחש ינחש בו</span><span class="font5">, “and he also uses it to divine by means of it;” this is why he left it on the table and acted as if&nbsp;he had forgotten it, in order to test you and find out if you&nbsp;would steal it. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis: the words: והוא נחש ינחש בו mean that you should have realised that Joseph would enquire&nbsp;from diviners what had happened to his goblet. A man of his&nbsp;stature has many diviners at his beck and call, and would&nbsp;find out quickly who had taken it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another explanation for these words: the expression describes an omen. An example of it being used&nbsp;in that context is found in Genesis 30,27: נחשתי ויברכני, Lavan&nbsp;saying to Yaakov: “I have found out that I have been blessed&nbsp;through your presence, by having resorted to divination.” In&nbsp;this instance the reverse was true, i.e. Joseph claimed that it&nbsp;seemed as a bad omen for him to have lost such a precious&nbsp;goblet. The word should not be explained as Joseph having&nbsp;used magic, as this would not be fitting for a man of his&nbsp;stature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">44,10. כדבריכם כן הוא, “</span><span class="font5">you are quite correct, i.e. the thief will be guilty of the death penalty. You yourselves have&nbsp;condemned him as such. However, I do not wish to apply&nbsp;such a harsh penalty. Seeing that only one of you is guilty,&nbsp;the others will not become slaves. The thief will, however,&nbsp;become a slave as his penalty. This was the accepted&nbsp;penalty for stealing in those days before the Torah had been&nbsp;given. Compare Genesis 43,18, where the brothers had been&nbsp;afraid of just that when thinking they had been framed by&nbsp;having had their money restored to them. After the Torah&nbsp;was given, the standard penalty for stealing was for the thief&nbsp;to pay compensation worth twice the value of the stolen&nbsp;object. (Exodus 22,2) If he did not have the money to pay&nbsp;such compensation he would become indentured as a&nbsp;servant for 6 years, the victim being paid by the employer of&nbsp;that thief who paid the court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">44,12. וימצא הגביע, “</span><span class="font5">the goblet was found;” as far as the money found in the bags also is concerned this was not part&nbsp;of the accusation of thievery, as it could not be proven that it&nbsp;was not excess money that the brothers had had with them&nbsp;not knowing the price of their purchase in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">44,16. מה נאמר לאדוני</span><span class="font5">, “what can we say to my lord?” This question referred to the return of their money after the&nbsp;first trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מה נדבר</span><span class="font5">, “what can we speak?” this question referred to the money found in their bags during the search now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מה נצטדק, </span><span class="font5">“how can we justify ourselves?” This referred to the goblet being found in the bag of one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גם אנחנו גם אשר נמצא הגביע בידו</span><span class="font5">, “both we and the one in whose hand the goblet has been found etc.;” why did&nbsp;Yehudah use the word גם, “also” twice in this verse? This&nbsp;was to teach us that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">also</span><span class="font5"> those of us against whom there is&nbsp;no evidence or suspicion at all, are prepared to remain as&nbsp;your master’s slaves, not to mention our brother in whose&nbsp;bag the goblet has been found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The difference between what Yehudah says now and what he had said in verse 9 is that in that verse he had&nbsp;accepted the death penalty for the person in whose bag the&nbsp;goblet would be found, as he had been so sure that none of&nbsp;their bags would contain it. When the brothers saw that it had&nbsp;been found in Binyamin’s bag, they offered themselves as&nbsp;slaves also, but backtracked on acknowledging that&nbsp;Binyamin would be sentenced to death. They hoped that&nbsp;their offer would save Binyamin from being convicted of the&nbsp;death penalty.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Vayigash</span></h1>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יהודה, </span><span class="font5">the reason why Yehudah was the one carrying on this dialogue was that it was he who had guaranteed&nbsp;Binyamin’s safe return to their father.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> what Yehudah meant was that “just as Pharaoh issues decrees and does not keep his promises,&nbsp;so you decree and do not keep your promise.” According to a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> what Yehudah referred to was that Joseph had only&nbsp;demanded to “see” Binyamin before releasing Shimon and&nbsp;letting us buy food and return to the land of Canaan. Instead&nbsp;he had detained them, invited them. caused them to become&nbsp;drunk with him, etc., as a result of which they found&nbsp;themselves in their present predicament. Another </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">quotes Yehudah as saying: just as Pharaoh violated the&nbsp;Egyptian law that a slave cannot be appointed ruler and he&nbsp;appointed you, so you too act illegally. Furthermore, Pharaoh&nbsp;had announced to the whole world that everybody was&nbsp;welcome to buy grain in Egypt, whereas hjs family had been&nbsp;discriminated against by having to bring his youngest brother&nbsp;all the way from the land of Canaan in order to buy grain for&nbsp;their starving family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">44,19. אדוני שאל</span><span class="font5">, “my lord had asked: etc.; actually, we&nbsp;do not find that Joseph had asked if they had a father or&nbsp;brother. They had volunteered this information without having&nbsp;been asked for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">44,21. ותאמר אל עבדיך הורידוהו אלי</span><span class="font5">, “You said to your servants: ‘bring him down to me.!’” The reason why I,&nbsp;Yedudah, am now speaking up on his behalf, is that I have&nbsp;guaranteed him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: when you said: ואשימה עיני עלי, “I will put my eye on him,” I thought that you meant that you&nbsp;will personally protect him. Instead you are doing the reverse&nbsp;and accuse him of having committed a crime. You are&nbsp;looking for ways to detain him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">44,33. ישב נא עבדך</span><span class="font5">, “let your servant (myself) remain;” (of his own free will) Yehudah’s proposal sounds strange, seeing&nbsp;that he feels Joseph’s charges are all trumped up and&nbsp;without substance. He claims that Joseph has no legal right&nbsp;to detain any of them and is acting like a kidnapper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי נבהלו מפניו</span><span class="font5">, “for they were frightened of him.”&nbsp;They were afraid of what he might do to them as reprisals for&nbsp;what they had done to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גשו נא אלי </span><span class="font5">“please come closer to me.” He told&nbsp;them about the subject of how he had been sold, in a&nbsp;whisper, so that bystanders could not hear him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different exegesis of these words: they were asked to approach him as </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> could do so; he, Joseph, being only&nbsp;one, could not come closer to some of them without at the&nbsp;same time distancing himself from some others. Besides, it&nbsp;was not in keeping with his dignity to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> he asked them to come near, so that he could show them, and them only, that he had been&nbsp;circumcised. There was no chance that this could have been&nbsp;misinterpreted as causing the brothers to believe that he was&nbsp;a Yishmaelite, who also perform the rite of circumcision on&nbsp;themselves, as they only performed this rite at the age of 13,&nbsp;as had their forefather Yishmael, and who leave a membrane&nbsp;around the glans untouched as distinct from the Hebrews&nbsp;who through being circumcised at an early age remove it&nbsp;when the fact that it has been removed remains clearly&nbsp;visible. Even though, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the Egyptians at&nbsp;that time also had been circumcised by a decree from&nbsp;Joseph, this was also done by the poor. Seeing that Joseph&nbsp;was wealthy, the only reason why he was circumcised would&nbsp;be because he was a Hebrew. What other Hebrew was in&nbsp;Egypt at that time? This mark would identify him as a Hebrew&nbsp;beyond doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועיני אחי בנימין</span><span class="font5">, “and the eyes of my brother&nbsp;Binyamin;” if you do not wish to reveal the fact that I had&nbsp;been sold on account of the oath to that effect that you have&nbsp;sworn, my brother Binyamin was not present at that time, nor&nbsp;has had any knowledge of it, he can reveal the details to my&nbsp;father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another explanation for the relevance of what Binyamin saw at that time: Binyamin had much more reason to have&nbsp;assumed that I must be dead, seeing that he was not present&nbsp;and had not subsequently become aware of my having been&nbsp;sold, and he therefore needs convincing more than you do.&nbsp;Besides up until now when I only communicated with you&nbsp;through an interpreter, you could have doubted this. Now that&nbsp;you hear me speak in Hebrew, you should no longer doubt&nbsp;that I am who I claim to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45,9. רדה אלי, </span><span class="font5">“come down to me</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">!” </span><span class="font5">he did not say: רד “come down numerical value 205”, but indicated that רדה&nbsp;numerical value 209, had already started i.e. we are already&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">within</span><span class="font5"> the 210 years decreed for the Israelites stay in Egypt&nbsp;so that the exile would not be lengthened by Yaakov and&nbsp;family resettling in Egypt without delay. There are only 209 of&nbsp;these years left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את כל כבודי</span><span class="font5">, “all the honour I enjoy;” he assured&nbsp;Yaakov that he had the wish and the power to make life&nbsp;comfortable for him in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על צוארי </span><span class="font5">(he embraced him) around his neck</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">both sides of his neck. Seeing he embraced him from both&nbsp;sides, the word for “neck” appears in the plural mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לכלם נתן לאיש </span><span class="font5">“to all of them he gave,” i.e. to&nbsp;each: the letter ל preceding the word: איש is vocalised with&nbsp;the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach.”</span><span class="font5"> [Not so in all our editions. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חליפות שמלות</span><span class="font5">, “changes of clothes;” shirts, pants, the undergarments people change frequently. In other words:&nbsp;garments that are worn directly on the skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternate explanation: outer garments. The reason why Joseph gave them these garments as presents was that he&nbsp;had been the cause that made them tear up their clothing&nbsp;when they found out that the goblet had been found in&nbsp;Binyamin’s bag. They had been deeply embarrassed to be&nbsp;walking around in torn garments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולבנימין</span><span class="font5">, “and to Binyamin;” seeing that he had not participated in his sale, he gave him three hundred silver&nbsp;pieces. As a result of this each of the other ten brothers had&nbsp;been treated as worth a slave, (according to the Torah, 30&nbsp;pieces of silver. Compare Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin</span><span class="font5"> 44, where it is stated&nbsp;that if someone sells his slave to a gentile he is penalised ten&nbsp;times his value.) Three hundred silver pieces are ten times&nbsp;the value of an able-bodied slave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחמש חליפות שמלות</span><span class="font5">, “and five sets of garments.” One on account of the garments that he had caused him to tear, the&nbsp;second one because he was his full brother, son of his&nbsp;mother. The third set as compensation for having made him,&nbsp;appear like a thief. The last two sets as the penalty a thief&nbsp;has to pay, i.e. twice the value of the goods he has stolen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: The gift Binyamin received was worth five times as much as that given to his brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שלח כזאת </span><span class="font5">“he sent a corresponding amount;” he&nbsp;sent his father ten sets of garments of the best quality&nbsp;available in Egypt ten donkeys, ten she-asses, for his ten&nbsp;brothers. Each one was to lead two animals. Even though&nbsp;Binyamin would also travel with them, he did not want to&nbsp;burden him with this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישלח את אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “he sent off his brothers;” [the&nbsp;following refers to the difference between </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vayishlach</span><span class="font5"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vayeshalach.</span><span class="font5"> Ed] the former means “to send something&nbsp;along,” whereas the latter means simply: “to send someone,&nbsp;or something.” In order to identify which is which, the former&nbsp;has a dot, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dagesh</span><span class="font5"> in the letter ל. (based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל תרגזו בדרך</span><span class="font5">, “do not worry of dangers on the way;” Joseph reassured the brothers that although they would&nbsp;migrate with great herds and flocks, something that would&nbsp;draw attention to them all over, his status in the region was&nbsp;such that no one would dare to attack them as they were his&nbsp;brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have encountered the meaning of “nervousness” as being רגז, also in Deuteronomy, 28,65, לב רגז.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: even though I have loaded you with great wealth in a time of famine when everyone else&nbsp;suffers from possessing very little, you have no reason to be&nbsp;nervous about its implications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויפג לבו</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov’s heart was standing still,&nbsp;stopped beating; (as in Lamentations 2,18, פוגת לך) he could&nbsp;not even react as he refused to believe the brothers. He only&nbsp;reacted </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> seeing the carriages that Joseph had sent&nbsp;along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the words: ויפג לבו, mean that he reacted joyfully, seeing that in the Talmud we see it used in&nbsp;this sense in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma,</span><span class="font5"> folio 19, אישי כהן גדול עמוד </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">והפג</span><span class="font5">&nbsp;אחת על הרצפה, “my lord the High Priest, arise and demonstrate&nbsp;joy,” (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> there). [According to this the High&nbsp;Priest rejected the implication that he was going to sleep as&nbsp;ridiculous; Ed.] In our case, Yaakov considered the claims by&nbsp;his sons as ridiculous, not worth even thinking about. The&nbsp;latter explanation is supported by Onkelos, who writes: פיגו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45.27. את כל דברי יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “all that Joseph had said.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash,i</span><span class="font5"> the reference is to Joseph having sent&nbsp;the carriages, not to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Pharaoh</span><span class="font5"> having sent them. Only before&nbsp;the arrival of the family in Egypt, were these carriages&nbsp;attributed to the generosity of Pharaoh. (46,5.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר שלח יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “that Joseph had sent.” Yaakov reasoned that if the sender had not been my son, no one else would&nbsp;have gone to the trouble to send me carriages to be riding in&nbsp;on my journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds that the consonants in the word עגלה have a dual meaning; they can mean </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eglah,</span><span class="font5"> “a heifer,” or they can&nbsp;mean </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">agalah,</span><span class="font5"> “carriage.” Joseph wished to remind his father&nbsp;that the last subject that they had discussed together were&nbsp;the laws pertaining to the heifer that is thrown off a cliff to&nbsp;atone for a murder committed by persons unknown.&nbsp;(Deuteronomy chapter 21) If you were to ask how these&nbsp;carriages were a memorable symbol of their discussion?&nbsp;When the Torah reports Yaakov as having accompanied&nbsp;Joseph part of the descent from the mountain on which&nbsp;Chevron is situated, Joseph is reported to have said to him&nbsp;that he should go back. In other words, there could not have&nbsp;been a connection to the subject of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eglah arufah,</span><span class="font5"> where&nbsp;our sages assume that the murdered person had not been&nbsp;accompanied, or he would have become the object of&nbsp;murder. His father had then told him that the subject of&nbsp;accompanying a departing guest would rank highly in the&nbsp;Torah in the future. The reason that Joseph reminded him of&nbsp;that was that it was something to which no one else could&nbsp;have been privy. The almost unbelievable text in&nbsp;Deuteronomy has the Supreme Court members proclaiming&nbsp;that it was not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> who had murdered the unknown victim.&nbsp;Who could have dared to accuse them of having done so?&nbsp;No one could have dreamt up such a paragraph in the Torah!&nbsp;Joseph made use of the play on words: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eglah/agalah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation: Joseph had placed heifers on the carriages, which would remind his father of their last&nbsp;conversation in case he had forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the carriages being once described as Pharaoh’s, and once as Joseph’s: it was forbidden to export&nbsp;cows unless their wombs had been removed so that they&nbsp;could not multiply in other countries. (Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chorot,</span><span class="font5"> 28).&nbsp;In this instance, an exception was made and express&nbsp;permission from Pharaoh was granted. When the carriages&nbsp;were described as having been sent by Pharaoh, the&nbsp;meaning is that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Pharaoh</span><span class="font5"> had given his permission, but the&nbsp;animals were owned by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Joseph</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותחי רוח יעק</span><span class="font5">ב, “the holy spirit which had departed from Yaakov since Joseph’s disappearance now returned to him.”&nbsp;(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash Hagadol</span><span class="font5"> 47,47.) As a result, although&nbsp;Joseph was only four or five days’ journey away from them&nbsp;they had no clue where he was for 22 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">45,28. רב, עוד יוסף בני חי, </span><span class="font5">“it is plenty;” Yaakov meant that when the brothers told him that Joseph was alive, and that&nbsp;he was a ruler in Egypt, the second part of the sentence was&nbsp;unnecessary, as long as he knew that Joseph was alive. He&nbsp;was totally unconcerned with Joseph’s standing politically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,1. לא־לוהי אביו יצחק</span><span class="font5">, “to the G’d of his father Yitzchok. His father Yitzchok had offered a sacrifice at the same altar,&nbsp;as we know from Genesis 26,28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אלוקי אביך</span><span class="font5">, “the G’d of your father.” G’d appeared&nbsp;to Yaakov in the same mode as Yaakov had addressed him,&nbsp;i.e. this is why He describes Himself as “the G’d of your&nbsp;father “</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. אל תירא מרדה מצרימה</span><span class="font5">, “do not fear descending to Egypt;” no one in the Bible had ever been told by G’d not to&nbsp;be afraid, unless he had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">already</span><span class="font5"> been afraid. Yaakov’s&nbsp;reasoning for being fearful was his knowledge that being&nbsp;strangers in a foreign land and being slaves which had been&nbsp;decreed already in the lifetime of his grandfather Avraham&nbsp;would most likely commence now that he was moving to&nbsp;Egypt. G’d answered him that although He had warned his&nbsp;father and grandfather of this, He appeared to him in order to&nbsp;give him reassurance. He hinted that although he was&nbsp;correct in assuming that the warning would soon be fulfilled,&nbsp;but by the same token, the promise made to all the three&nbsp;patriarchs that they would develop into a great nation, came&nbsp;closer to its fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46.4.</span><span class="font5"> גם עלה, the word גם “also,” which appears superfluous, means that not only would his bones be buried&nbsp;in the cave of Machpelah, but that all the bones of his&nbsp;children would also find their eternal resting place in the Holy&nbsp;Land. He also assured him that Joseph would be present&nbsp;when it came time for him to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויוסף ישית ידו על עיניך</span><span class="font5">, “and Joseph will place his hand on your eyes (and close them forever.)” This was an accepted&nbsp;custom in those days. It implied that Joseph would also be&nbsp;instrumental in his remains being transferred to the cave of&nbsp;Machpelah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of this verse: the words: על עיניך, are not to be understood literally, but are derived from&nbsp;the word עין being used as referring to someone’s or&nbsp;something’s, fountain, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">essence</span><span class="font5">, as in עין יעקב, (Deuteronomy&nbsp;33,28) where it refers to the personification of what Yaakov&nbsp;stood for. According to this interpretation, G’d assured&nbsp;Yaakov that in Joseph he will have a suitable successor. He&nbsp;will take care ably of all his needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,7. בנותיו, </span><span class="font5">“his daughters</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">the plural mode is used although Yaakov had only one daughter. This is a customary&nbsp;way of the Torah referring to descendants, and we find a&nbsp;parallel in referring to male descendants in verse 23 of our&nbsp;chapter i.e. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובני דן חושי</span><span class="font5">ם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“Dan’s sons were called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chushim,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">as well as in Numbers 26,8 where the children of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Palu</span><span class="font5"> are&nbsp;called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eliav,</span><span class="font5"> even though each of the fathers had only one&nbsp;son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,8. ואלה שמות</span><span class="font5">, “and these are the names, etc.” the Torah enumerates them once more in order to highlight the&nbsp;miracles of the Lord showing how seventy souls who&nbsp;migrated to Egypt developed into nation of at least 2,5 million&nbsp;souls within the space of 210 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,10. בן הכנענית</span><span class="font5">, “the son of a Canaanite woman.” This verse testifies to the fact that the respective wives of&nbsp;Yaakov’s sons were of Egyptian, Edomitic, and Midianite&nbsp;descent; the reason that this particular son of Shimon has&nbsp;been singled out as having been born of a Canaanite mother,&nbsp;is that his father is criticised for having married a Canaanite&nbsp;woman, something that had not been considered appropriate&nbsp;already since Avraham’s time. This is also why the&nbsp;premature death of Er and Onan, sons of Yehudah, had&nbsp;been mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to another interpretation, the reason why Er and Onan have been mentioned here altogether, although&nbsp;they died before the family descended to Egypt, is that if they&nbsp;had objected to Joseph’s sale, his father would have listened&nbsp;to them. [This leaves open the question of what happened to&nbsp;Yehudah’s third son Sheylah, who though apparently not&nbsp;having descended to Egypt, is not listed here by name,&nbsp;though he had the same two parents as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Er</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Onan.</span><span class="font5"> G’d’s&nbsp;reasoning had been: you, Yehudah have not taken into&nbsp;account that you caused your father terrible grief by depriving&nbsp;him of Joseph, I will cause you grief at the time when the&nbsp;family will rejoice by depriving you of two of your sons, and&nbsp;mentioning this here in order to rekindle your pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,15. אלה בני לאה, </span><span class="font5">“these were the sons of Leah. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">comments on this that from here we learn that when a&nbsp;woman orgasms first she will give birth to a male child. The&nbsp;rationale is that the woman’s seed in such a situation has&nbsp;already started to disperse, whereas the man’s seed&nbsp;ejaculated later is still in its original strength. The reverse is&nbsp;true when the man ejaculates earlier, i.e. that the woman’s&nbsp;seed being last is still in its original strength, resulting in its&nbsp;immediate conception. (Compare Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Niddah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 31)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,21. בלע ובכר, </span><span class="font5">we must not make an issue of the number of Binyamin’s sons, as according to the report in&nbsp;Chronicles I 8,1-5 there were 11 sons. We must simply&nbsp;assume that at the time when Binyamin descended to Egypt&nbsp;the eleventh son had not yet been born. The difference in&nbsp;some of their names may also be accounted as due to their&nbsp;being listed once more. This is something we find also in&nbsp;other instances where the Bible records the same people&nbsp;more than once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וארד, </span><span class="font5">the letter ו in this word is vocalised with the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,23. ובני דן חושים</span><span class="font5">, and the name of Dan’s children: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chushim.</span><span class="font5"> There were two, one of them died and his name&nbsp;has not been mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,26. כל נפש ששים ושש</span><span class="font5">, “The combined total of souls were 66.” They were made up of 33 children of Leah&nbsp;including Dina, Chetzron, Chamul and Yocheved who was&nbsp;born at the border of Egypt, included. Zilpah had a total of&nbsp;16, including Chever and Malkiel. Rachel’s descendants at&nbsp;that time were 14, and Bilhah’s were seven. You have to&nbsp;deduct Joseph and his two sons as well as Yocheved, [who&nbsp;did not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">descend</span><span class="font5">. Ed.], as explained by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> Compare verse&nbsp;46 according to which the number is made up of people&nbsp;having left the land of Canaan. The words: יוצאי ירך יעקב,&nbsp;“biological offspring of Yaakov,” have been added to tell us&nbsp;that the wives of both Yaakov and his sons were not&nbsp;included. [Our author may have added these words as&nbsp;otherwise we would have to assume that both Bilhah and&nbsp;Zilpah had already died. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,27. הבאה מצרימה שבעים, </span><span class="font5">“who had arrived in Egypt, (were) seventy.” This number includes Joseph, his two sons,&nbsp;and Yocheved, (Moses’ mother). The Torah does not worry&nbsp;about minor inaccuracies as it concerns itself with the&nbsp;overwhelming majority. There are many examples of this rule&nbsp;having been applied. [Perhaps the best known examples are&nbsp;when Moses refers to the Jewish people comprising six&nbsp;hundred thousand men of the ages 20-60, as well as when&nbsp;during the census, each time with a single exception, the&nbsp;total of the numbers of each tribe always ends with the digit&nbsp;zero, i.e. have been rounded off. Ed.] The only females in the&nbsp;count above are: Dinah, Yocheved, Serach. [In the author’s&nbsp;text which this editor works from, there appear four more&nbsp;names of males at this point, all grandsons of Yaakov. I have&nbsp;not been able to figure out why these names appear there.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to a view expressed in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> that twin sisters were born with all of Yaakov’s sons, we would have to&nbsp;assume that they had all died before the family’s descent to&nbsp;Egypt, with the exception of Dinah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת יהודה שלח לפניו אל יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “and he (Yaakov) had&nbsp;sent Yehudah ahead to Joseph;” so that he would be&nbsp;informed about which route to travel to the province of&nbsp;Goshen and thus to avoid entering Egypt proper. Joseph had&nbsp;already told him that he would live there in order to be close&nbsp;to Joseph (Genesis 45,6).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבך על צואריו עוד</span><span class="font5">, “he (Joseph) still continued&nbsp;weeping while embracing his father,” in addition to when he&nbsp;had wept when being re-united with his brother Binyamin.”&nbsp;(45,10; 45,14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of this verse: the word: עוד refers to the weeping being in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">addition</span><span class="font5"> to embracing each other&nbsp;around their necks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,32. וצאנם ובקרם וכל אשר להם</span><span class="font5">, “and their flocks and herds and all that they owned;” they need to tend these so&nbsp;that they do not have time to become professional soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">46,34. ואמרתם אנשי מקנה</span><span class="font5">, “you’ll say: ‘we are cattle growers by vocation.’” Joseph was worried that if his brothers&nbsp;would occupy senior positions in Pharaoh’s Palace, this&nbsp;would result in jealousies and they would use this to reduce&nbsp;his status. He remembered that the “uniform” indicating rank,&nbsp;i.e. the striped coat had had worn, had led to all these&nbsp;jealousies once before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי תועבת מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “for it is something that the Egyptians detest;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands the line as “for it is a deity of&nbsp;Egypt;” i.e. it is something that G’d detests, i.e. an idol. Their&nbsp;favorite astrological constellation was that of the lamb, which&nbsp;they worshipped. [“Worshipping” in the language of pagans&nbsp;means “to be afraid of.” Ed.] We find a similar expression&nbsp;concerning the favorite idol of the Moabites, (Kings II 23,14)&nbsp;i.e. שקוץ מואב ולמלכום תועבת בנימין, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“kemosh</span><span class="font5"> the abomination of&nbsp;Moav, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Milcom,</span><span class="font5"> the abomination of the Ammonites.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,4. לגור בארץ באנו</span><span class="font5">, “we came here for only a temporary stay, sojourn;” At that time they did not entertain the idea of&nbsp;becoming permanent residents of Egypt. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pessikta Zutrata)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אין מרעה </span><span class="font5">“for there is no grazing land;” they emphasised this aspect so that Pharaoh should not think that&nbsp;they had come to sponge on Joseph. They asked permission&nbsp;to stay in Goshen, עתה for now, until the Lord in His wisdom,&nbsp;will let the climate improve in the land of Canaan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,6. במיטב הארץ הושב את אביך</span><span class="font5">, “in the most fertile part of the land settle your father!;” seeing that he is aged and is&nbsp;only looking for peace and quiet and clean air, let him dwell&nbsp;is that part of the land; as far as your brothers are concerned,&nbsp;let them settle in the region of Goshen which has excellent&nbsp;grazing land. Our author continues with: “Do not tell me that&nbsp;the cantillation mark </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">etnachta</span><span class="font5"> under the words: ואת אחיך&nbsp;clearly contradicts this interpretation.” This is not the only&nbsp;time that an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">etnachta,</span><span class="font5"> divisive cantillation mark, does not&nbsp;override the plain meaning of the verse. To mention just one:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judges 5,18 זבולון עם חרף נפשו למות ונפתל על מרומי שדה; “Zevulun is a people that mocketh at death; Naftaly on the&nbsp;open heights.” The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">etnachta</span><span class="font5"> under the word Naftaly in that&nbsp;verse is not meant to be divisive. Devorah surely lauded both&nbsp;those tribes as partners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אנשי חיל</span><span class="font5">, “able and astute people.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi, </span><span class="font5">Joseph described his brothers as not only intelligent but as&nbsp;loyal and trustworthy. Examples of the use of that word in&nbsp;that sense are: Proverbs 31,10: אשת חיל מי ימצא, “who is&nbsp;fortunate enough to find a truly wise woman?” Clearly&nbsp;Solomon did not speak about a woman who prepared for&nbsp;battle as a soldier! [Except in modern day Israel, where do&nbsp;women serve in the army in battle formations? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמתם שרי מקנה</span><span class="font5">, “you will appoint them as being in charge of livestock.” (Pharaoh speaking to Joseph&nbsp;concerning his brothers) The livestock that Pharaoh was&nbsp;most interested in were camels, mules and horses. If we&nbsp;needed proof that this interpretation is correct, it can be&nbsp;found in Chronicles I 28,1: ויקהל דוד את כל שרי ישראל ושר כל&nbsp;הרכוש ומקנה, “David assembled all the chieftains of Israel as&nbsp;well as the chieftains in charge of inert possessions, and the&nbsp;chieftains in charge of livestock, etc.; immediately before this&nbsp;verse, the previous chapter speaks of camels and she-asses&nbsp;(27,30) and the officers in charge of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: Seeing that the areas in which defenseless sheep, goats and cows graze are unprotected,&nbsp;the people looking after them must be strong, able and&nbsp;capable of defending them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,8. ?כמה ימי שני חייך</span><span class="font5">, “how old are you?” Pharaoh was under the impression that Yaakov was extremely old, as he&nbsp;bore the marks of his sorrow filled life marked on his facial&nbsp;features.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yaakov replied: “do not be surprised that I look so old, the experiences that I have undergone during my life thus far&nbsp;have left their mark on me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrashim</span><span class="font5"> quote G’d as responding to Yaakov describing his life as a series of harsh experiences by&nbsp;pointing out that no one before had been protected from as&nbsp;many dangers facing him as had Yaakov. According to these&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrashim,</span><span class="font5"> the reason why Yaakov lived 33 years less than&nbsp;his father and 28 years less than his grandfather was on</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">account of his not having appreciated all that G’d had done for him. The number 33 is arrived at by counting the number&nbsp;of words in verse 8 of our chapter commencing from the&nbsp;word: ויאמר up to and including the word: מגוריהם in verse 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,12. ויכלכל יוסף את אביו</span><span class="font5">, “Joseph sustained his father;” Yaakov had become dependent on Joseph’s economic&nbsp;support, as according to what we read in verse 13, the&nbsp;amount of grain available in Egypt during those years for the&nbsp;general population was just enough for bread for each&nbsp;individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לפי הטף</span><span class="font5">, “the rations Joseph handed out were not based on the price of bread, but on the number of children each&nbsp;family head had to support.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בשנה השנית</span><span class="font5">, “during the second year;” according&nbsp;to the plain meaning of the text, this refers to the second year&nbsp;after Yaakov had arrived in Egypt, which was the fourth year&nbsp;of the famine. The food which had been stored up during the&nbsp;seven years of plenty plus the financial savings of the&nbsp;population had sufficed to see them through the first three&nbsp;years. In the fourth year the people tendered their livestock&nbsp;for food, and in the fifth year they tendered their land&nbsp;holdings. In the sixth year they agreed to become slaves of&nbsp;Pharaoh in return for receiving rations from Joseph’s stores.&nbsp;In the seventh year, Joseph gave them seed to plant and&nbsp;they planted it, collecting a harvest in the eight’s year, and&nbsp;the famine was over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא נכחד</span><span class="font5">, “we cannot hide, etc.” i.e. “we have nothing left that we could hide instead of offering it to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גם אדמתינו</span><span class="font5">, “also our land holdings.” The words&nbsp;מיתה, “death,” and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חי, </span><span class="font5">“live,“ are here both used when&nbsp;speaking of death and life respectively, “so that we live and&nbsp;not die.” [Is it not obvious that if you do not die you must be&nbsp;alive? Ed.] Our author points out that such usage of the&nbsp;Hebrew language. He cites as examples: Nechemyah 9,6:&nbsp;ואתה מחיה את כולם, “and You keep them all alive.” If G’d’s&nbsp;creatures do not plough the earth and grow things for&nbsp;themselves, they will not stay alive. In other words, they will&nbsp;be no better than dead. [Manna will not fall from heaven. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being given life is not an end in itself, but only a means to staying alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אנחנו ואדמתנו עבדים לפרעה</span><span class="font5">, “both we and our soil will be slaves to Pharaoh.” We will be his slaves, and the soil will he&nbsp;will hand over to us is to be taxed from its yield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,21. ואת העם העביר אותו, </span><span class="font5">“as far as the people were concerned, Joseph transferred them wholesale (to new&nbsp;locations). Once they were settled on soil which had never&nbsp;been theirs, they would be less capable of returning to soil&nbsp;which had in the meantime acquired new lessees. Every&nbsp;Egyptian from now on was going to be a stranger in the land&nbsp;in which he was born, so that it would more difficult for them&nbsp;to point at the Hebrews among them as foreigners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47, 22. רק אדמת הכהנים</span><span class="font5">, “only the soil belonging to the priests (Joseph did not transfer to Pharaoh).” They therefore&nbsp;would not have any reason to start a rebellion against&nbsp;Pharaoh. A different reason given for Joseph’s preferential&nbsp;treatment of the priests is as we explained already, that the&nbsp;priests had suggested a method by which to test if Joseph or&nbsp;the wife of Potiphar had spoken the truth, as a result of&nbsp;which, Joseph instead of being hanged had only been put in&nbsp;jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,24. ונתתם חמישית לפרעה</span><span class="font5">, “and you will hand over 20% of the harvest to Pharaoh as his share. The harvest was&nbsp;divided into five equal portions. 1) to serve as seed, 2) to go&nbsp;to Pharaoh as tax; 3+4) to provide for the grower and his&nbsp;family. 5) To provide for his other dependents such as&nbsp;servants, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,27</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאחזו בה</span><span class="font5">, “they became totally attached to it.”&nbsp;They acquired land that served as the ancestral heritage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויפרו וירבו</span><span class="font5">. “they became fruitful and they multiplied.” Thus G’d’s promise to the Yaakov in 46,3, became fulfilled.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Vayechi</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,28. ויחי יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov lived;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;reason why this portion has not been separated from the&nbsp;preceding portion by as much as the space of a single letter,&nbsp;is because with the death of Yaakov the “eyes and the heart”&nbsp;of his descendants were as if closed to the spiritual mission&nbsp;they were to bring to the world, as they were being enslaved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You might well ask that seeing that Joseph his son ruled in Egypt for another 54 years during which all of his&nbsp;descendants enjoyed complete freedom, how is that&nbsp;possible? The answer is that this was not quite so. His family&nbsp;had become culturally too dependent on Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation for the omission of even a minimum amount of blank space in the Torah before the&nbsp;commencement of this portion is that the subject dealt with&nbsp;here was inextricably interwoven with what preceded it, i.e.&nbsp;the Torah’s description of the years during which Yaakov&nbsp;lived thus far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחי יעקב בארץ מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">lived</span><span class="font5"> in the land of Egypt;” all the years of Yaakov until he settled in Egypt could not&nbsp;truly be described as חיים, “life,” seeing that they were all&nbsp;clouded by different kinds of anguish. It was only during his&nbsp;last seventeen years in Egypt that his mind was at rest and&nbsp;not beset by serious worries of one kind or another. In fact,&nbsp;this whole verse has been inserted in the Torah as a&nbsp;compliment to Joseph who was the cause of Yaakov’s last&nbsp;seventeen years being happy years. During those 17 years&nbsp;he repaid his father who had sustained him for the first&nbsp;seventeen years of his life, by providing for him during the&nbsp;last 17 years of his life. He had been seventeen years old&nbsp;when he had been sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,29. ויקרא לבנו ליוסף</span><span class="font5">, “he called for his son, for Joseph.” He did so, seeing that G’d had told him while he&nbsp;was on his way to Egypt that Joseph would be present when&nbsp;the time came for him to die, and that he would close his&nbsp;eyes for the last time. (46,4) Another reason was that the&nbsp;only reason why Yaakov had undertaken the journey </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">down</span><span class="font5"> to&nbsp;Egypt had been in order to be near Joseph. It would&nbsp;therefore be appropriate that Joseph would accompany him&nbsp;on his ascent to the Holy Land to be buried with his&nbsp;ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שים נא ידך תחת ירכי</span><span class="font5">, “please put your hand beneath my hip.” This method of swearing an oath was the equivalent of&nbsp;what a handshake is in our days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועשית עמדי חסד ואמת</span><span class="font5">, “and perform for me an act of kindness and truth.” Wherever we find the expression חסד&nbsp;ואמת, it refers to giving someone more than he is entitled to&nbsp;expect, or asking him to do something beyond what he is&nbsp;entitled to demand. One such example is found in Samuel II&nbsp;15,20: שוב והשב את אחיך עמך חסד ואמת, “go back and take your&nbsp;kinsmen with you and perform an act of loyalty and kindness&nbsp;(with them).” [David was in dire straits and staying with him&nbsp;was likely to result in the death of Ittai and his men. He was&nbsp;not obligated to remain faithful to David. Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yaakov reminds Joseph that while it is his duty to bury his father, he is not entitled to demand of him to bring him to&nbsp;burial in the cave of Machpelah. He therefore pleads with him&nbsp;not to bury him in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,30. ושכבתי עם אבותי</span><span class="font5">, “I wish to have my last resting place with my forefathers;” he referred to his grave. He&nbsp;realised that this could be done only if Joseph would&nbsp;transport his remains all the way to the cave of Machpelah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: When using the words ושכבתי עם אבותי, Yaakov referred to being buried in Egypt,&nbsp;temporarily, whereas when adding: אל נא תקברני במצרים, he&nbsp;asked Joseph not to make his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">permanent</span><span class="font5"> grave in Egypt.&nbsp;This corresponds to what we have learned in the Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nazir</span><span class="font5"> 64: “if someone is found buried in a normal&nbsp;fashion, (but not in a graveyard) when transferring the corpse&nbsp;to a Jewish graveyard, he should take along a certain&nbsp;amount of the earth surrounding the corpse with it. When&nbsp;applied to Yaakov, this means that some Egyptian soil was&nbsp;taken with his corpse on his way to be deposited also in the&nbsp;cave of Machpelah. The Talmud there defines how much&nbsp;soil, (approx 3 fingers deep of earth). Yaakov too referred to&nbsp;this amount of Egyptian soil, when he said: ונשאתני ממצרים,&nbsp;“and carry me up from Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כדברך, </span><span class="font5">“as you have said.” The word is spelled without the letter י, i.e. in the singular mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">47,34. על ראש המטה</span><span class="font5">, Yaakov gave thanks to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem </span><span class="font5">Who had made Joseph’s heart decide to bury his father with&nbsp;his forefathers. This is how Joseph’s dream about the sun&nbsp;bowing down to him, was fulfilled, i.e. he had bowed to the&nbsp;Presence of G’d, not to his son. [The “sun” in the dream, had&nbsp;been Yaakov. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי אחר הדברים האלה</span><span class="font5">, “it was after these events,&nbsp;etc;” ever since the universe had been created it had never&nbsp;happened that someone after having sneezed recovered&nbsp;from his illness. He would have died immediately, regardless&nbsp;of where he had been when he sneezed. Yaakov asked G’d&nbsp;to change this, so that he would be able to make his last will&nbsp;and testament before dying. G’d answered his prayer. This is&nbsp;the reason why this paragraph commenced with the words:&nbsp;‘”It was after these words,“ after G’d had consented to give&nbsp;Yaakov enough time to prepare for his departure from earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only this, but all the kings of the earth became very agitated, when they heard that Yaakov had died only after&nbsp;having made all these arrangements about his forthcoming&nbsp;demise. Ever since that time, not only Jews, but believing&nbsp;people everywhere, pronounce a benediction when they hear&nbsp;someone sneeze. G’d had transformed what used to be a&nbsp;signal of death to continued life, (compare Pirkey de Rabbi&nbsp;Eliezer, (earliest kabbalistic text) chapter 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתחזק ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “Israel recovered his strength.” He&nbsp;decided to look upon himself as if healthy, seeing that the&nbsp;gifts bestowed by someone close to death, as long as he is&nbsp;able to stand, are considered in Jewish law as having been&nbsp;bestowed by a person healthy in body and mind. Israel was&nbsp;very anxious for the blessings he was about to bestow as&nbsp;being viewed as the blessing of a person completely healthy.&nbsp;Such a person’s gifts are irrevocable in law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48,4. ונמתין* לקהל עמים</span><span class="font5">, “and I will make you into a community of nations.” Even though G’d had used the plural&nbsp;mode, only Binyamin had been born for him after that. This&nbsp;being so, Yaakov said: “I must transfer the unfulfilled part of&nbsp;that blessing as belonging to my son (Joseph)”. Ephrayim&nbsp;and Menashe, each being one of the 12 tribes of Israel, are&nbsp;viewed as representing fulfillment of that part of G’d’s&nbsp;blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ועתה,שני בניך וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and now, as far as your two sons&nbsp;are concerned, etc.;” according to the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Batra&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">123, the reason why Yaakov appointed both of Joseph’s&nbsp;sons as becoming founders of the twelve tribes, something&nbsp;he did not promise to any of his other sons, was because&nbsp;Joseph had sustained the whole family during the years of&nbsp;famine. Further more, Joseph had been the firstborn of&nbsp;Rachel who had been his principal wife, as opposed to the&nbsp;respective firstborn sons of Zilpah and Bilhah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another explanation: Yaakov felt that this was one way he could honour the memory of Rachel versus the&nbsp;concubines by increasing the heritage of the sons of Rachel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reuven had already forfeited his original claim to extra rights of the firstborn, having been guilty of a major&nbsp;indiscretion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48.6.</span><span class="font5"> ו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מולדך אשר הולדת אחריהם</span><span class="font5">, “and any sons that you will beget after them, etc.” sons of Ephrayim and Menashe&nbsp;that will be born while you are alive, will be considered as&nbsp;yours, founders of tribal families. They will rank on a par with&nbsp;the sons of Yehudah and Asher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על שם אחיהם</span><span class="font5">, “their names will be subcategories of their fathers’ (who are part of the original twelve brothers)&nbsp;ancestral shares (when it comes to the distribution of the&nbsp;land of Israel)”. The formulation על, here, is similar to:&nbsp;Leviticus 25,31, על שדה הארץ יחשב, “they shall be classed as&nbsp;open country.” This is also reflected in what the Torah writes&nbsp;in 50,23: 'וירא יוסף לאפרים בני שלשים וגו, “and Joseph lived to&nbsp;see the third generation, i.e. children and grandchildren of&nbsp;Ephrayim.” What the Torah tells us there is that although&nbsp;neither of them had been born in the land of Canaan, seeing&nbsp;they had been born during the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">lifetime</span><span class="font5"> of their father or&nbsp;grandfather who </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">had been</span><span class="font5"> born in the Holy Land, they were&nbsp;included in the founding families, בתי אבות, of their respective&nbsp;tribes. Other such grandchildren were considered founding&nbsp;families of their respective tribes as they were born in the&nbsp;Holy Land. For instance: grandchildren of Asher, through&nbsp;Briyah. (46,17). According to the Talmud referred to earlier&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Baba Batra,</span><span class="font5"> 123), it is not clear precisely according to which&nbsp;criteria the distribution of parcels of land during Joshua’s time&nbsp;proceeded.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48,7. ואני בבואי מפדן ארם</span><span class="font5">, “as far as I a am concerned, when I came from Padan Aram , etc.” (Yaakov, who insists&nbsp;on being buried in the cave of Machpelah, owes Joseph an&nbsp;explanation for why he did not bury Joseph’s mother Rachel&nbsp;there, when he was much closer).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Rachel died on me suddenly at a time when I did not yet possess undisputed entitlement to that burial ground,&nbsp;since your uncle Esau had not yet ceded it to me by leaving&nbsp;the Land of Canaan with his whole family, so that an attempt&nbsp;to do so would have involved me in a confrontation with&nbsp;Esau, and it would have been most unseemly for your&nbsp;mother remaining unburied at that time. When I buried my&nbsp;wife Leah in the cave of Machpelah, Esau had already&nbsp;vacated the land of Canaan.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואקברה שם</span><span class="font5">, “I buried her there,” (where she had died) I knew that the piece of land where I buried her would in the&nbsp;future be still part of the ancestral heritage of Binyamin, and&nbsp;it would be fitting for her to have her last resting place in soil&nbsp;that would be part of her children’s heritage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find an interesting verse in Samuel 10,2, where Samuel has just crowned the first Jewish King, Sha-ul, a&nbsp;descendant of Rachel from the tribe of Binyamin, and says to&nbsp;the newly crowned King: “when you leave me this day, you&nbsp;will meet two men near the tomb of Rachel </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">in the territory of&nbsp;Binyamin, at a place called Zeltzah;”</span><span class="font5"> Yaakov, added that if he&nbsp;had buried Rachel in the cave of Machpelah, which is in the&nbsp;territory of Yehudah, a son of Leah, this would not have been&nbsp;appropriate, seeing that she and Leah had been rivals during&nbsp;their lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of this paragraph, quotes Yaakov as follows: “the reason that I have buried your mother where&nbsp;I did, at the time, was that seeing that she had died in&nbsp;childbirth and having to transport her any distance would&nbsp;most likely have resulted in her blood becoming putrid after&nbsp;having soiled her shroud. Seeing that I wanted to at least&nbsp;bury her in the holy soil of the land of Israel, I buried her&nbsp;where I did, just inside that land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary on this verse, according to whom Rachel’s tomb was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">outside</span><span class="font5"> the Holy&nbsp;Land.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48.8. ויאמר</span><span class="font5">, ״</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מי אלה</span><span class="font5">?״, he said: “who are these?” According to the plain meaning of the text, Yaakov’s eyesight&nbsp;had been dimmed so that he could not recognise their facial&nbsp;features; This is why the Torah added that his failing eyesight&nbsp;was due to old age, (verse 10) If you were to counter that the&nbsp;Torah had described Yaakov just before as “seeing the sons&nbsp;of Joseph,” (verse 8) this was not sufficient to be able to&nbsp;identify them individually. He had no trouble indentifying&nbsp;Joseph as he recognised him by his voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר נתן לי אלוקים בזה</span><span class="font5">, “whom G’d has given me in&nbsp;this land.” They were born to me before you came down to&nbsp;Egypt so that you should include them in the list of the twelve&nbsp;tribes. This is why Yaakov responded by telling Joseph that&nbsp;as far as he was concerned Joseph’s sons Ephrayim and&nbsp;Menashe would be just like Reuven and Shimon for him&nbsp;(Verse 5). Joseph explains that this is why he brought them&nbsp;with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא פללתי</span><span class="font5">, an expression describing prayer as a&nbsp;request from G’d. We find this word in this sense also in&nbsp;Psalms 106,30, where it quotes Pinchas as having prayed.&nbsp;Yaakov says that he had not even prayed to see Joseph&nbsp;again, as it would have been inappropriate seeing that he&nbsp;thought he had seen evidence that Joseph had been the&nbsp;victim of a wild beast. (Genesis 37,33)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: whenever this word occurs it refers to making a judgment, i.e. arriving at a definitive&nbsp;conclusion. Yaakov would have been saying that he had&nbsp;never even entertained real hope to see Joseph again.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48,13. ויקח יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “Joseph had already taken.” [Contrary&nbsp;to the past tense mode with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vav hahippuch</span><span class="font5"> .Ed] This&nbsp;verse ought to be understood as following verse 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישת על ראש אפרים</span><span class="font5">, “he placed it (his right hand)&nbsp;on the head of Ephrayim.” He did so with the intent of&nbsp;including them in the 12 tribes. We find a similar expression&nbsp;when Moses placed his hands on Joshua appointing him as&nbsp;his successor (Numbers 27,23).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שכל את ידיו</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov placed his hands by using his intelligence, i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sechel.</span><span class="font5"> One could have thought that instead&nbsp;of crossing his hands, Yaakov should have asked that the&nbsp;sons of Joseph switch their position in front of their&nbsp;grandfather, but that is precisely what Yaakov did not want&nbsp;them to do. He did not want to embarrass Menashe by&nbsp;relegating him to his left side, seeing that after all he was&nbsp;Joseph’s firstborn, and he deserved to be treated with&nbsp;respect on account of this. The only reason he had not&nbsp;placed his right hand on the head of Menashe, was that he&nbsp;had seen through his holy spirit that his younger brother&nbsp;would historically be of greater importance than the first born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It occurs frequently that the word “כי,” means “although;” for instance: Psalms 41,5: כי חטאתי לך, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">although</span><span class="font5"> I&nbsp;have sinned against You.” Or, Psalms 25,11: כי רב הוא,&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">although</span><span class="font5"> it is great.” Or, Exodus 13,17: כי קרוב הוא, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">although&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">it is nearby.” The author states that he could have quoted&nbsp;many more examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויברך את יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “he blessed Joseph.” A blessing&nbsp;given to the sons is automatically also a blessing for their&nbsp;father. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;המלאך הגואל אותי</span><span class="font5">, “the angel who redeems me;” in&nbsp;verse 15 Yaakov had commenced the blessing by referring&nbsp;to G’d by His name of “האלו-הים,” whereas in this verse he&nbsp;has switched to an angel as the source of the blessing. How&nbsp;are we to account for this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The two verses have to be understood as follows: “The G’d before Whom I and my forefathers have walked by&nbsp;means of His angel who protected me against all harm; may&nbsp;He arrange for that same angel also to protect the lads who&nbsp;are your sons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48,18. לא כן אבי</span><span class="font5">, “not so my father!” He meant: “they are not lined up in the order that you thought they were lined up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48,20. וישם</span><span class="font5">, “he positioned (in the blessing) the name</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אפרים לפני מנשה, </span><span class="font5">of Ephrayim before the name of Menashe.” He had done so already in verse 5, before the&nbsp;sequence of the blessing had become an issue. By making a&nbsp;comparison with Reuven and Shimon in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font5"> order, his&nbsp;intention had been unmistakable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">48,22. שכם אחד</span><span class="font5">, “one portion;” the letter א in the word אחד is vocalised with the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach.</span><span class="font5"> (as if it were in the&nbsp;construct mode)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר לקחתי, </span><span class="font5">“which I have taken;” he meant that he would take this (accept this) in the days of Joshua when the&nbsp;tribes would receive their shares of the Holy Land. In those&nbsp;days all of this would be conquered with the sword and the&nbsp;bow and arrow. The use by Yaakov of the past tense here is&nbsp;parallel to the use of the past tense concerning the money for&nbsp;the purchase price of the cave of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Machpelah,</span><span class="font5"> when Avraham&nbsp;had said: נתתי כסף השדה קח ממני, “I have already given the&nbsp;money for the field, accept it from me.” (Genesis 23,13) Just&nbsp;as Avraham at the time was certain that Efron would finalise&nbsp;the negotiation, so Yaakov was certain that G’d would keep&nbsp;His promises concerning the Israelites receiving their&nbsp;ancestral land in due course. The reason why Yaakov&nbsp;singled out the Emorite and no other Canaanite tribe is that&nbsp;this was by far the strongest of the Canaanite tribes. We find&nbsp;proof of this in Amos 2,9: ואנכי השמדתי את האמורי מפניהם אשר&nbsp;כגובה ארזים גבהו וחסון הוא כאלונים, “yet I destroyed the Emorite&nbsp;before them, whose stature was like that of the cedars&nbsp;amongst the trees and who was as stout as oak trees.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation: when Yaakov speaks of “my sword and my bow,” he quotes G’d, just as we have the line&nbsp;said by Moses in Deuteronomy 33,29: בה' מגן עזרך ואשר חרב&nbsp;גאותך, “by G’d your protecting shield, your sword is&nbsp;triumphant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here understands our verse as Yaakov referring to the surrounding tribes making a joint effort to avenge the&nbsp;male inhabitants of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5"> whom Shimon and Levi had&nbsp;killed, as abstaining from their intention, i.e. “they did not&nbsp;pursue the sons of Yaakov.” (Genesis 35,5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49,1. אשר יקרא אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “what is going to happen to you;” here Yaakov intends to foretell the future; these were not&nbsp;meant to be </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">blessings</span><span class="font5">, as we do not find that he blessed&nbsp;Reuven, Shimon, and Levi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Torah writes in verse 28 of this chapter: וזאת אשר דבר להם אביהם, “and this is what their father had said to&nbsp;them,” (followed by “their father blessed them”) we have to&nbsp;understand that verse a follows: “this was what he foretold&nbsp;them.” The details of his blessing were not spelled out by the&nbsp;Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באחרית הימים</span><span class="font5">, seeing that Yaakov did not say: ימים, “years,” but הימים, “the years,” it is clear that he spoke of&nbsp;years that we have already heard about. He referred to the&nbsp;400 years which G’d had already revealed to his grandfather&nbsp;Avraham as the period his descendants would be strangers,&nbsp;and part of this time even slaves, in a country not their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וראשית אוני</span><span class="font5">, “and the first product of my virility.”&nbsp;Even though we have a tradition that a woman never&nbsp;conceives as a result of the first time she has engaged in&nbsp;sexual intercourse, it is possible to achieve such conception&nbsp;by means of what is called: מעיכה, “squeezing,” in the Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot,</span><span class="font5"> folio 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[It is quite difficult to accept this interpretation as the Torah makes plain that Leah did </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">get pregnant from the&nbsp;first time she slept with Yaakov, seeing that in Genesis 29,31&nbsp;it states clearly that G’d </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">helped</span><span class="font5"> her get pregnant when He&nbsp;observed that Yaakov “hated” her. Clearly this was not&nbsp;before the first night. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כחי וראשית אוני יתר שאת</span><span class="font5">, “my might and first fruit of my virility, exceeding in rank;” Yaakov refers to what Reuven&nbsp;would have been entitled to, i.e. an extra share in the&nbsp;inheritance as a result of being the first born. The word אוני&nbsp;refers to financial strength. As in Hoseah 12,9: מצאתי און לי, “I&nbsp;have become rich!” The meaning of the word שאת is as in&nbsp;לשאת, “bearing,” self assured posture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי עלית</span><span class="font5">, “when you mounted;” “you desecrated&nbsp;Him Who is present even when I have intimate relations with&nbsp;my wife.” Yaakov accuses Reuven that as of the day when&nbsp;he invaded his privacy, he no longer received&nbsp;communications from the Holy Spirit. This was because he&nbsp;felt ritually unfit to have marital relations with Bilhah. The&nbsp;word עלה occurs in the sense of “departing, withdrawing its&nbsp;presence,” also in Psalms 102,25: על תעלני בחצי ימי, “do not&nbsp;take me away in the midst of my days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שמעון ולוי אחים</span><span class="font5">, “Shimon and Levi are full&nbsp;brothers.” This point is recorded by Yaakov to inform us that&nbsp;these two were always of the same mind, as opposed to the&nbsp;other brothers. However, while generally speaking, this is&nbsp;laudable, it could become dangerous when their wrath is&nbsp;aroused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כלי חמס מכרותיהם</span><span class="font5">, “their weapons are lawlessness.” (JPS) Their very close relationship is a dangerous weapon.&nbsp;The word מכרה is familiar to us from Kings II 12,6, where the&nbsp;expression: איש מאת מכרו, means: “each from his buddy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בקהלם, </span><span class="font5">“in their counsel,” (may my soul not take&nbsp;part) there is no prefix letter ו here as we find in the word&nbsp;וברצונם, “and when they are well disposed;” Yaakov shuns&nbsp;being associated with their plans under any circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עקרו שור</span><span class="font5">, “they uprooted an ox;” according to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum Yerushalmi,</span><span class="font5"> this is an allusion to their having sold&nbsp;Joseph. Joseph had elsewhere been compared to an ox, as&nbsp;opposed to his brother Yehudah, who had been likened to a&nbsp;lion. (Deuteronomy chapter 33)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: according to Onkelos, the word שור here symbolises a חומה, wall, this was accomplished by&nbsp;exchanging the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cholem</span><span class="font5"> for the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shuruk.</span><span class="font5"> The wall&nbsp;referred to would be that around the city of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">49.7.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ארור אפם, </span><span class="font5">“cursed be their anger;” this is not a&nbsp;curse, but a blessing. How so? Yaakov wishes them that&nbsp;whatever they will plan in anger should not succeed, so that&nbsp;they will learn the lesson not to act out of anger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis of these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yaakov </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">exclaims: “</span><span class="font5">how disgraceful and despicable is their anger!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">אחלקם ביעקב, “I will separate them between the tribes of Yaakov and disperse them.” We find that indeed the&nbsp;ancestral share of Shimon became an enclave within the&nbsp;ancestral portion of Yehudah. Levi’s share was divided into&nbsp;48 cities between the twelve tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">יהודה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> אתה </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">יודוו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> אחיך</span><span class="font5">, as to Yehudah, -“your brothers&nbsp;will acknowledge you (as leader);” we have a play on words&nbsp;here, using Yehudah’s name as synonymous with the&nbsp;owner’s position amongst this brothers. The word יודרך, is&nbsp;equivalent to ישבחוך ויכבדוך, “they will praise you and honour&nbsp;you.” This will happen when they see you subduing your&nbsp;enemies, i.e. ידך בעורף אויביך, ”your hand will be around the&nbsp;neck of your enemies.” When this happens, they will&nbsp;prostrate themselves before you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מטרף בני עלית</span><span class="font5">, “you removed yourself from the&nbsp;temptation to treat my son as your prey.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">here; “you did not consider that killing my son Joseph would&nbsp;be an achievement.” Yaakov admits that he had once&nbsp;suspected him of having killed Joseph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 6 and 7, the expression בצע used by Yehudah when persuading his brothers not to kill&nbsp;Joseph (37,26) is not understood as Yaakov praising&nbsp;Yehudah for not killing; rather it is a compliment to him for&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">admitting</span><span class="font5"> to have been wrong when he accused his&nbsp;daughter-in-law Tamar of harlotry when it had been he who&nbsp;had sought out an assignation with someone whom he&nbsp;thought of as a harlot. He had cancelled the decree to&nbsp;execute her and the two fetuses she was carrying, thereby&nbsp;publicly shaming himself. (Genesis 38,26)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא יסור שבט מיהודה</span><span class="font5">, “the rod (mace) will never&nbsp;leave Yehudah;” once the crown will be placed on a member&nbsp;of the tribe of Yehudah (King David), it will never be placed&nbsp;on the head of someone belonging to another tribe; (as&nbsp;opposed to the first King of Israel, Sha-ul, who had been&nbsp;unable to establish a dynasty.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומחוקק מבין רגליו</span><span class="font5">, “nor will scribes be absent from sitting at his feet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד כי יבא שילה</span><span class="font5">, “until the arrival of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shiloh,</span><span class="font5"> when the kingdom will be split, and Jerovam will be appointed to rule&nbsp;over ten of the twelve tribes. Yaakov refers to the people&nbsp;after the death of Solomon assembling to appoint Jerovam&nbsp;and to dissent from Rechavam, Solomon’s son and&nbsp;successor. [There is no verse in the Bible stating that this&nbsp;occurred at Shiloh;] perhaps our author understands </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“shiloh”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">as a reference to the prophet Achiyah Hashiloni, who had&nbsp;first informed Jerovam that he would become king over the&nbsp;ten tribes in Kings I 11,29, and who resided in Shiloh, as we&nbsp;know from Kings 14,2. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: Yaakov simply referred to Achiyah the prophet who stemmed from Shiloh, and who told&nbsp;Jerovam who was at the time fleeing from the wrath of King&nbsp;Solomon that he would become King over ten tribes, but at&nbsp;the same time warning him not to interfere with the Kingdom&nbsp;of Yehudah, a remnant of David’s empire. (Kings I 11,29-31.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולו יקהת עמים, </span><span class="font5">“and to whom the gathered nations will belong.” The ten tribes will congregate at Shiloh to crown&nbsp;Jerovam as their head. This has all been spelled out in Kings&nbsp;I 12,1. The crowning took place at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem,</span><span class="font5"> but Shiloh and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5"> were practically next door (about 10 k.m.) to one&nbsp;another. Compare Joshua 24,1, and immediately after that&nbsp;Joshua 24,26 where Joshua is reported as recording all this&nbsp;“at the Temple of the Lord,” (which was at Shiloh) without&nbsp;any mention of Joshua having had to move to there to do&nbsp;this. This comment is mentioned here only as a reply to&nbsp;heretics who insist that Shiloh cannot be the name of a town,&nbsp;as a town is always feminine in Hebrew, so that the&nbsp;masculine יבא, “he will come,” would be inappropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Essentially, Yaakov describes the greatness of Yehudah as lasting from when David ascended the throne&nbsp;until his grandson Rechavam forfeited most of his kingdom.&nbsp;Seeing that Yaakov did not want to spell out the decline of&nbsp;Yehudah, he worded it in a manner that lets us draw these&nbsp;conclusions ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49,11. סותה, </span><span class="font5">a variant of the word: מסוה, “veil, or mask.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49,13. זבולון לחוף ימים ישכון</span><span class="font5">, “Zevulun (his territory) will border on the ocean.” The sons of Yaakov are listed here in&nbsp;the order of their births. The only exception is that Zevulun&nbsp;although younger, is mentioned ahead of his brother&nbsp;Yissachar. The reason is that the territory of Yissachar was&nbsp;located between that of Dan and that of Zevulun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the reason why Zevulun here appears before his senior brother Yissachar was because&nbsp;Yaakov foresaw that in the future it would be thanks to the&nbsp;financial support of that tribe, that the Tribe of Yissachar&nbsp;could devote themselves to intensive Torah study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על צידון</span><span class="font5">, “as far as the city of Tzidon.” This city was an international trading center, as is known from Isaiah 23,2:&nbsp;דומו יושבי אי, סחר צידון, “moan you dwellers of the coastland,&nbsp;you traders of Tzidon, once thronged by seafarers over many&nbsp;waters.” This is also why some hundreds of years later,&nbsp;Moses blessed that tribe by saying: שמח זבולון בצאתך ויששכר&nbsp;באהלך, “rejoice Zevulun when you set out, and you,&nbsp;Yissachar, in your tents.” Moses referred to Zevulun setting&nbsp;out on ocean voyages for trading purposes. The word: על,&nbsp;before the word: צידון, means “close by.” Another example of&nbsp;that word being used in this sense is in Exodus 40,3: וסכות על&nbsp;הארון, “you will make the Dividing curtain screen it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49,14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;רובץ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בין המשפתים</span><span class="font5">,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“crouching between</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">boundaries.” His territory was hemmed in on both sides between his tribal brothers as spelled out in Joshua 19,1023.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49,15. וירא מנוחה כי טוב</span><span class="font5">, “he realised that reposing is good;” [Compared to the stormy seas that his brother&nbsp;Zevulun had constantly to contend with? Ed.] Our author&nbsp;sees in this expression a parallel to Proverbs 23,31, אל תרא יין&nbsp;כי יתאדם, which he translates as “do not praise wine though it&nbsp;is red,” i.e. it has hidden features which are far less&nbsp;appealing. Yissachar is conscious of the advantages of&nbsp;residing peacefully on his land, as opposed to his brother&nbsp;Zevulun, who, though in search of great riches, faces many&nbsp;stormy seas and potential pirates before bringing home his&nbsp;spoils. Moses reflects the same thoughts when blessing the&nbsp;two tribes in his parting address to the nation, saying: “rejoice&nbsp;Zevulun at the beginning of your quest, but you, Yissachar&nbsp;באהלך, are content in your tent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויט שכמו לסבול</span><span class="font5">, “he (Yissachar) willingly bent his shoulder to become a tribute-payer.” (agricultural work is deemed the&nbsp;same as paying a tax). The words bracketed refer to the&nbsp;farmer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having to fork over part of his hard worked for harvest to the Royal treasury. (Compare Samuel I 8,14-15, where the&nbsp;prophet warns the people that they will have to pay taxes to&nbsp;the king that they so dearly wish to be ruled by.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis on the line: ויט שכמו לסבול: Yissachar puts up with any of his brethren that pass through&nbsp;his territory on the way elsewhere. This is an exceptional&nbsp;virtue. The result of his tolerance of these inconveniences&nbsp;turns him into a tax paying servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;דן ידין עמו</span><span class="font5">, “Dan will judge his people.” This tribe&nbsp;had walked loyally in the footsteps of Moses as well as of&nbsp;Joshua as testified to in Joshua 6,9: והמאסף הולך אחרי הארון,&nbsp;“and the rearguard walked behind the Holy Ark.” It was this&nbsp;tribe’s task to ward off any attacks from the rear. They had&nbsp;been assigned this task as they were considered&nbsp;exceptionally brave. The word ידין, may therefore best be&nbsp;translated as: “he will avenge.” Compare Deuteronomy&nbsp;32,36: כי ידין ה' עמו, “for the Lord will avenge His people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יהי דן נחש</span><span class="font5">, “may Dan be like a snake lying in&nbsp;ambush on the way” to kill potential attackers of the gentile&nbsp;nations; his bravery will use the most unlikely weapons, such&nbsp;as when Samson used a jawbone to kill 1000 Philistines&nbsp;(Judges 15,16.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שפיפון</span><span class="font5">, “a viper;” closely related to the expression: in Genesis 3,15: הוא ישופך ראש, “man will crush the serpent’s&nbsp;head;” (in response to the serpent attacking his heel)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ויפול רכבו אחור, “so that its rider will fall off backwards.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'לישועתך קויתי ה</span><span class="font5">, “I have always hoped for Your&nbsp;salvation, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem”</span><span class="font5"> Yaakov addresses the tribe of Dan when&nbsp;saying this; in other words: Yaakov prayed that Dan will be&nbsp;successful in his defense of the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: “I have hoped to G’d that your (Dan’s) efforts at saving his people will succeed.” (as&nbsp;predicted by the angel who told the wife on Manoach of the&nbsp;forthcoming birth of Samson, and that he would be the first to&nbsp;save the people from the Philistines. (Judges 13,5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גד גדוד יגודנו</span><span class="font5">, “Gad’s soldiers will troop after the&nbsp;armies of Israel when they go out to war (to conquer their&nbsp;ancestral heritage) during the battles under Joshua; they will&nbsp;be in the forefront as we know from Deuteronomy 3,18,&nbsp;where Moses commanded them to march as the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">vanguard</span><span class="font5"> of&nbsp;the Israelite army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא יגד, </span><span class="font5">“he shall raid at the heels of their enemies.” (When returning from battle) (They will not only be the&nbsp;vanguard at the beginning of the battle, but also the mopping&nbsp;up operation at the tail end of the battle.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis for the line: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא יגוד עקב</span><span class="font5">: this tribe will always be in pursuit of enemies remaining, thus finding&nbsp;himself at the heel of their enemies. Compare: 49,8: ידך בעורף&nbsp;אויביך, “your hand will be around the neck of your enemies&nbsp;(Yehudah)”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מאשר, שמנה לחמו</span><span class="font5">, as to Asher: “the food (Gad) he&nbsp;will produce will be richer than that of Asher.” Seeing that&nbsp;Yaakov had not blessed Gad with material blessings, when&nbsp;turning to Asher by saying that its food would be </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">richer</span><span class="font5"> than&nbsp;that of Asher, he makes it clear that the soil of its ancestral&nbsp;portion is excellent grazing land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא יתן מעדני מלך</span><span class="font5">, “and he will provide royal delicacies.” Yaakov does not imply that the land that Asher resides on&nbsp;will be inferior; but he says that Gad too will provide royal&nbsp;delicacies seeing that its soil is good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the richest food in the land will originate from the soil of the tribe of Asher. It will be even&nbsp;richer that that provided by the tribe of Gad, which was well&nbsp;known for its quality. Cooking oil used to be provided&nbsp;primarily from the olive trees on the territory of Asher. This is&nbsp;also reflected in Moses’ blessings in Deuteronomy 33,24:&nbsp;ברוך מבנים אשר, “the Jewish people will bless Asher thanking&nbsp;him for providing such abundant and high quality oil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא יתן מעדני מלך, </span><span class="font5">“and he will provide the king with taxes in the form of oil.” It was this oil that was used to anoint&nbsp;Jewish kings from the tribe of Yedudah. [</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As this was not necessary after David had been crowned, and his dynasty was inherited automatically by his&nbsp;successors who did not need to be anointed, this editor does&nbsp;not understand this interpretation, as the quantity of oil&nbsp;required was minute and used only a single time. Ed.]&nbsp;According the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot</span><span class="font5"> 86, and the commentary&nbsp;there by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam,</span><span class="font5"> the function of that oil was to act as a&nbsp;body hair remover and as a skin lotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נפתלי אילה </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">שלוחה</span><span class="font5">, “Naftaly is like a free running&nbsp;doe,” (its productivity) members of that tribe being fast long&nbsp;distance runners, used to be dispatched to inform the civilian&nbsp;population of whether a battle had been won or lost, so that&nbsp;they would be prepared for what would follow. This is the&nbsp;meaning of the words following: הנותן אמרי שפר, “bearer of&nbsp;good news.” Compare Judges 5,18 ונפתלי על מאומי שדה,&nbsp;“Naftaly running swiftly across the open heights.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is an opinion according to which the word: אילה does not refer to a doe, but means: “the plain,” as in Genesis&nbsp;14 6; yet another opinion relates the word to אילן as in אילי&nbsp;הצדק in Isaiah 61,3: “oaks of righteousness.” The word שלוחה&nbsp;is best rendered as נטועה, “planted.” An example of this use&nbsp;of the word is found in Isaiah 16,8: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">שלוחותיה</span><span class="font5"> נטשו עברו ים,&nbsp;“their </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">shoots</span><span class="font5"> spread and crossed the sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אמרי שפר</span><span class="font5">, “words of praise.” This is an allusion to branches, ענפים, as in שנים, שלושה גרגרים בראש </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אמיר</span><span class="font5">, “two or&nbsp;three berries on the topmost branch.” (Isaiah 17,6). The&nbsp;meaning of the verse then is: “the highest plains of his land&nbsp;will be planted with branches that bear beautiful fruit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.22. בן פורת יוסף</span><span class="font5">, also a variant of the word ענפים, “branches.” Joseph is viewed as the son whose branches&nbsp;grow profusely as if planted along abundant waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עלי עין, </span><span class="font5">“by a fountain; it is the custom of poetry in the Holy Tongue to engage in such (apparent) repetitions of&nbsp;similar sounding words. Examples are Psalms 93,3 </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">נשאו&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">נהרות ה', </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">נשאו</span><span class="font5"> נהרות קולם, “the oceans </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">sound</span><span class="font5">, o Lord; the&nbsp;oceans; </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">sound</span><span class="font5"> their thunder.” Or, Judges 5,3: אנכי לה', אנכי&nbsp;1“ ;אשירה will sing; I will sing to the Lord;” (Victory hymn by&nbsp;Devorah). There are many more such examples in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בנות</span><span class="font5">, the branches growing out of the trunks of trees. Yaakov is saying that they grow beyond the highest points of&nbsp;the walls surrounding them, i.e. צעדה עי שור, “girls stepped up&nbsp;to the wall” (to get a glimpse of him).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">צעדה, </span><span class="font5">plural form of the feminine mode of the verb צעדו in the parallel masculine version. Another example of a&nbsp;similar construction can be found in Isaiah 59,12: וחטאתינו&nbsp;ענתה בנו, “and our sins testify against us;” or in Exodus 17,12:&nbsp;ויהי ידיו אמונה, “His hands remained steady.” A third such&nbsp;example would be in Exodus 9,31: והפשתה והשעורה נוכתה, “but&nbsp;the flax and the barley had been struck” (by the hail.) The&nbsp;parable here deals with Joseph increasing more so than his&nbsp;brothers, seeing that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> his sons became recognised as&nbsp;fully fledged tribes. The sons of Joseph are quoted as saying&nbsp;to Joshua: “And I have become a numerous people as the&nbsp;Lord has blessed me that much” (Joshua 17,14.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וימררוהו ורבו</span><span class="font5">, “they embittered him and they&nbsp;quarreled. This was the result of the arrow tongued brothers&nbsp;hating him already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותשב באיתן קשתו</span><span class="font5">, “Yet his bow stayed in its&nbsp;original position;” Yaakov illustrates how Joseph restrained&nbsp;himself not taking revenge on his brothers when he had the&nbsp;opportunity to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויפוזו זרועי</span><span class="font5">, “the arms of his hands were ornamented with fine gold by the hands of the Mighty One of Yaakov;” when&nbsp;pulling at the strings of his bow, his arms would display these&nbsp;ornaments. The word: ויפוזו is a synonym for רקוד, “dance;’&nbsp;According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam,</span><span class="font5"> it denotes movements by the arms,&nbsp;whereas כרכור describes the parallel movements with one’s&nbsp;legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the words: ותשב באיתן קשתו, mean that he did not respond to his enemies in kind, but&nbsp;restrained himself and, on the contrary, spoke to them in a&nbsp;friendly manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to that interpretation, the words ויפוזו זרועי ידיו mean that although being a powerful king and having at his&nbsp;disposal many means of avenging himself for wrongs done to&nbsp;him, he did not display this characteristic. If you were to ask&nbsp;whence he had learned such self control and forbearance,&nbsp;the answer is: from none other than his father Yaakov, אביר&nbsp;יעקב, who served as his model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">משם</span><span class="font5">, from this model he also learned to look after the economic needs of the different families of the numerous&nbsp;family of Yisrael. (his cousins and second cousins)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אבן</span><span class="font5">, a word related to אב, father, in the sense of family; the letter ן at the end is not an integral part of the word. We&nbsp;have other examples of such apparently unnecessary letters&nbsp;ן in שגעון or רצון, חרון,רעבון, ,עורן and ערבון. (Based on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ברכות שדים ורחם</span><span class="font5">, “the blessings of the breasts and&nbsp;the womb.” Yaakov paraphrases the blessings emanating&nbsp;from a celestial source, i.e. שמים, and emanating from earth,&nbsp;i.e. ארץ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the “blessings of the breasts,” are a simile for stilling thirst, whereas “the blessings of the&nbsp;womb,” are that the fetus will not be stillborn. (Based on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam)</span><span class="font5"> In this instance, the breasts appear first before&nbsp;the womb, although they are not needed until after the baby&nbsp;has been born, seeing that a mother begins to feel that she&nbsp;has a supply of milk even before the baby has been born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, the prophet Hoseah, in Hoseah 9,14, says: תן להם רחם משכיל ושדים צוצקים, “give to them a&nbsp;womb that miscarries and shriveled breasts, in that order.&nbsp;(When he lambasts his countrymen for their disloyalty to G’d,&nbsp;and prays to G’d </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">to allow such people to develop&nbsp;normally.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נזיר אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “the one who had been separated from&nbsp;his brothers.” Our author understands the word נזיר here as&nbsp;“the prince among his brothers.” He uses Lamentations 4,7,&nbsp;זכו נזיריה משלג, “her elect were purer than snow, ”as the&nbsp;source where the word is used in that context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בנימין זאב</span><span class="font5">, “Binyamin is like wolf;” a metaphor&nbsp;implying that the kingdom of Sha-ul, a descendant of&nbsp;Binyamin, would not endure, just as a wolf does not spend&nbsp;time with his prey. On the other hand, the Kingdom of David&nbsp;is compared to that of a lion, which does spend time with its&nbsp;prey, not being afraid of anyone challenging it. (Compare&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah Shleymah</span><span class="font5"> on this verse)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זאב יטרף</span><span class="font5">, “a wolf that will attack and kill most domesticated animals.” The wolf consumes in the morning&nbsp;sufficient parts of his prey to last him until evening, after&nbsp;which he distributes the remains to its young. The blessing&nbsp;has been worded as a parable. The letter ו at the beginning&nbsp;of the word: ולערב, is unnecessary; there are many such&nbsp;unnecessary letters in the Torah, and especially when the&nbsp;text is not prose but poetry. There is no point in arguing that&nbsp;from the cantillation mark </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">etnachta</span><span class="font5"> under the word עד that it&nbsp;is divisive; I have already explained this in Genesis 47,6 in&nbsp;connection with the words: במיטב הארץ, under the word אחיך&nbsp;where I listed a number of examples that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">etnachta</span><span class="font5"> is not&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">always</span><span class="font5"> a divisive cantillation mark, or rather, that it does not&nbsp;always override the plain meaning of the verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולערב יחלק שלל</span><span class="font5">, “and at night he divides the plunder.” I have already mentioned that this is the habit of wolves as per&nbsp;Tzefaniah 3,3: זאבי ערב לא גרמו לבקר, “wolves of the evening;&nbsp;they leave no bone until morning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר כברכתו</span><span class="font5">, “in accordance with the individual&nbsp;blessing of each.” (Appropriate for events in the future&nbsp;experienced by each tribe.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויצו אותם</span><span class="font5">, “He commanded them;” that they&nbsp;should all accompany Joseph in the funeral cortege all the&nbsp;way to the cave of Machpelah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל אבותי</span><span class="font5">, same as if it had said: עם אבותי, “with my forefathers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לאחוזת קבר</span><span class="font5">, “as a burial property.” Yaakov&nbsp;reminds Joseph that there is no legal way to dispute that he&nbsp;is entitled to be buried there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49,32. מאת בני חת, </span><span class="font5">“from the Hittites.” Yaakov repeats this although he had already spelled out that the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">individual&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">from whom his grandfather purchased this field was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Efron&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Hittite</span><span class="font5">, as Efron himself was no longer alive to confirm his&nbsp;claim. Seeing that Joseph also had not been present at the&nbsp;time when this transaction had taken place, he went into&nbsp;great detail so that he would know how to answer anyone of&nbsp;Efron’s heirs if he would dare to dispute his father’s claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">49,33. ויאסוף רגליו אל המטה</span><span class="font5">, “he retracted his feet into the bed.” Originally, he had been sitting on the edge of the bed&nbsp;as mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph his feet&nbsp;having been in contact with the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50,1. </span><span class="font5">לח</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נוט את אביו</span><span class="font5">, “in order to embalm his father.“ According to a commentary quoted by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam,</span><span class="font5"> some&nbsp;commentators understand the word לחנוט as derived from&nbsp;חנטה, blossoming, i.e. the oil for this embalming would have&nbsp;been taken from the plant when it had grown only one third to&nbsp;its ultimate height. The expression is familiar from Song of&nbsp;Songs 2,13, התאנה חנטה פגיה, “the fig tree has formed its small&nbsp;figs.” Accordingly, embalming (olive) oil is derived from as yet&nbsp;unripe olives. Compare also the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah</span><span class="font5"> 13 on&nbsp;this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבכו אותו מצרים</span><span class="font5">, We find numerous words in the&nbsp;Torah where the prefix ב is missing. This is one of these&nbsp;words, and the phrase means: “Yaakov’s death was&nbsp;mourned with weeping in Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעים יום </span><span class="font5">“for seventy days.” 40 of these days were spent embalming him, and the remaining thirty were official&nbsp;mourning. We also find that both Moses and Aaron were&nbsp;mourned for thirty days. Compare Numbers 20,20 and&nbsp;Deuteronomy, 34,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the “seventy days;” each of the direct descendants of Yaakov who had come to Egypt&nbsp;with him mourned him for one day each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;דברו נא באזני פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “please intercede on my behalf&nbsp;with Pharaoh;” seeing that some nineteen years earlier&nbsp;Pharaoh had decreed that no one in Egypt could undertake&nbsp;anything new until it had been approved by Joseph, Pharaoh&nbsp;would not look kindly at the prolonged absence from Egypt of&nbsp;his general manager on whom he depended so much.&nbsp;(Compare Genesis 41,44). Moreover, Pharaoh might be&nbsp;afraid that Joseph would not even return to Egypt at all.&nbsp;Seeing that he was familiar with all the military and political&nbsp;secrets of Egypt, he would be a potentially dangerous&nbsp;adversary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויעל עמו</span><span class="font5">, “and there he took up with him (To&nbsp;Canaan) with him, etc;” The word ויעל in this verse may be&nbsp;understood just as the same word in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ויעל</span><span class="font5"> עולות, in Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">8,20, i.e. as a transitive form of the verb, “he caused the&nbsp;sacrifices to ascend.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויעש לאביו אבל שבעת ימים</span><span class="font5">, “he observed a seven&nbsp;day mourning period for his father.” Some commentators&nbsp;claim that the chieftains of Esau assembled at that location to&nbsp;honour the memory of Yaakov as well as the prince of the&nbsp;Yishmaelites and the sons or grandsons of Keturah. This&nbsp;was a new mourning. It was the custom that when a relative&nbsp;of the deceased arrived from afar to participate in the funeral,&nbsp;a new additional rite of mourning is observed and they weep&nbsp;anew over their loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירא יושב הארץ הכנעני</span><span class="font5">, “the inhabitants of the land&nbsp;of the Canaanite tribes “saw;” the reference is to the&nbsp;Emorites under Sichon and to the ones under Og. They also&nbsp;called themselves “Canaanites.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains thus on&nbsp;several occasions both in the Book of Numbers and in the&nbsp;Book of Judges on several occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר בעבר הירדן</span><span class="font5">, “whose habitat is on the East Bank of the river Jordan.” These Kings had seen the mourning being&nbsp;observed at the threshing ground of Atad (verse 10) which&nbsp;was located on Canaanite land on the East Bank. Just as the&nbsp;inhabitants of the land of Canaan proper called that region&nbsp;“East Bank,” in the days of Joshua who settled the Israelites&nbsp;on the West Bank, so the people residing on the East Bank&nbsp;called the area across the Jordan “West Bank. We have&nbsp;proof of this in Numbers 32,19: כי לא ננחל אתם מעבר לירדן והלאה&nbsp;כי באה נחלתנו מעבר לירדן מזרחה, “for we will not inherit with them&nbsp;on the other side of the Jordan because our inheritance has&nbsp;fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastwards.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כאשר צום, </span><span class="font5">“as he had commanded them;” to do&nbsp;during his funeral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישאו אותו בניו</span><span class="font5">, “His sons carried him, etc;” only&nbsp;his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">sons,</span><span class="font5"> not any of his grandsons as they had Canaanite&nbsp;mothers. We have read in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 50, “are we to assume that Yehudah’s wife (Genesis&nbsp;38,2) was really a Canaanite, in spite of the fact that&nbsp;Avraham had gone to great length to insure that Eliezer&nbsp;would not select a Canaanite wife for his son Yitzchok?&nbsp;(Genesis 24,3 Yitzchok) Yitzchok had similarly instructed his&nbsp;son Yaakov. The answer given by the Talmud is that the&nbsp;word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Canaanite</span><span class="font5"> also means: “trader,” and that the Torah told&nbsp;us in Genesis 38,2 that Yehudah’s wife was the daughter of&nbsp;a well known trader, named Shua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to counter how this can be squared with the opinion expressed on Genesis 37,35 where we read about&nbsp;Yaakov’s “sons and daughters all trying to comfort Yaakov&nbsp;over the disappearance and presumed death of Joseph,” that&nbsp;all of Yaakov’s sons had twin girls born with them, so why did&nbsp;Yehudah not marry one of them or a granddaughter of&nbsp;Yaakov? We must assume that all of these twin daughters&nbsp;died prematurely so that the sons of Yaakov had no other&nbsp;option but to marry Canaanite girls. To the additional&nbsp;question why they could not at least have married the&nbsp;children of Shimon of whom we know that he had a son by a&nbsp;Canaanite woman (Genesis 46,10)? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B‘reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 80,10&nbsp;suggests that Sha-ul borne to Shimon was actually a son of&nbsp;Sh’chem who had raped Dinah; one opinion offered is that&nbsp;Shimon buried that offspring in the land of Canaan before the&nbsp;brothers descended to Egypt and that this is why he is&nbsp;referred to as son of a Canaanite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Getting back to the question why the grandsons of Yaakov were not part of the pall bearers, of the grandfather;&nbsp;Joseph did not wish to do anything that could arouse&nbsp;jealousies among them, some being biologically qualified&nbsp;others not; seeing that no one would be jealous of Ephrayim&nbsp;and Menashe who were princes, he did not object to their&nbsp;being pall bearers. (They would also be founding fathers of&nbsp;tribes in the future) Moreover, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> says that Levi was not&nbsp;among the pall bearers, as he would be carrying the Holy&nbsp;Ark. More questions are raised as to how Moses could carry&nbsp;the coffin of Joseph at the Exodus, seeing that he too was a&nbsp;Levite. A suggestion is offered that Joseph’s coffin, similar to&nbsp;the Holy Ark, did not actually need pall bearers as it carried&nbsp;itself, similar to the Holy Ark which is described as carrying&nbsp;its bearers. (based on a verse in Psalms 80,2: כצאן יוסף יושב&nbsp;הכרובים, (Compare more about this in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moshav z’keynim)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.15. ויאמרו לו ישטמנו יוסף</span><span class="font5">, they said: “perhaps Joseph&nbsp;will hate us.” When the brothers had returned from burying&nbsp;their father in Canaan, Joseph passed the pit into which the&nbsp;brothers had thrown him and recited the blessing: “the G’d&nbsp;Who has performed a miracle for me at this place.” When the&nbsp;brothers heard this they became afraid that old animosities&nbsp;might flare up again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויצוו אל יוסף</span><span class="font5">, according to the Jerusalem Targum&nbsp;they instructed the sons of Bilhah to tell Joseph in the name&nbsp;of their father that he had said before being gathered in to tell&nbsp;Joseph etc. etc,.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועתה שא נא</span><span class="font5">, “and now, etc;” from this word on,&nbsp;the sons of Bilhah added words of their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וילכו גם אחיו</span><span class="font5">, Joseph’s brothers also followed&nbsp;themselves after having sent ahead the sons of Bilhah. (They&nbsp;did after they saw him weep).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50,23. גם בני מכיר בן מנשה, </span><span class="font5">“also the sons of Machir, a son of Menashe;” the word גם is meant to include Ephrayim&nbsp;and his children in what is described in this verse. How are&nbsp;we to understand this in practice? Joseph only saw&nbsp;Ephrayim’s grandchildren, whereas he did live to see&nbsp;Menashe’s great grandchildren. We know this from which of&nbsp;the descendants of Joseph are listed in the portion of&nbsp;Pinchas (Numbers 26,29-37) there as founders of בתי אבות,&nbsp;clans, all of whom were born during Joseph’s life time.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Bamidbar Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 14,7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">50,26. ויישם בארון</span><span class="font5">, “he was placed in a coffin;” as opposed to being interred; the reason that he was not&nbsp;interred was so that his descendants when the time came&nbsp;could take his remains with them to the Holy Land as they&nbsp;had sworn to him that they or their children would do. The&nbsp;construction of ויישם is similar in meaning to ויושם. We find a&nbsp;similar construction in Exodus 30,32: על בשר אדם לא ייסך, “it&nbsp;must not be rubbed on any person’s flesh (skin).” The prefix&nbsp;letter ב in the word: בארון has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz</span><span class="font5"> under it. This&nbsp;is meant to inform the reader that the coffin had already been&nbsp;prepared for Joseph during his lifetime, i.e. he was placed in&nbsp;the coffin with which he had been familiar. This is the only&nbsp;one of the patriarchs of which temporary burial in a casket&nbsp;has been reported, as the later generations, who had not&nbsp;even been alive when he died, would transport him from&nbsp;Egypt.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Sh’mot</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואלה שמות</span><span class="font5">, “And these were the names of;” the&nbsp;prefix letter ו in the word ואלה is intended to connect what is&nbsp;written here to what had been written at the end of the Book&nbsp;of Genesis. The connection is with the three generations of&nbsp;Joseph through Menashe that he is reported to have still&nbsp;known before he died (Genesis 50,22). He had witnessed the&nbsp;fulfillment of the descendants of Avraham multiplying while in&nbsp;a land not their own. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points out that when the Jewish&nbsp;people were compared by G’d as “numerous as the stars,”&nbsp;G’d meant that these stars are not just numbers but each&nbsp;one has a name and its coming and going is supervised by&nbsp;its Creator. Similarly, in spite of becoming numerous the&nbsp;Jewish people never were just numbers but each one having&nbsp;a name ensured that he would be treated on an individual&nbsp;basis by G’d. If someone were to ask where it is written that&nbsp;the Jews that Yaakov brought with him to Egypt were&nbsp;numbered by him, the Torah states that not only were they&nbsp;numbered but they were named, i.e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואלה שמות </span><span class="font5">“and these were the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">names</span><span class="font5">.” The Torah informs us that all the people that came down to Egypt with&nbsp;Yaakov also died in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הבאים מצרימה</span><span class="font5">, this construction is most unusual, we would have expected the Torah to write: אשר באו, “who&nbsp;arrived,” not such an indeterminate present tense as הבאים,&nbsp;literally: “Who were arriving.” The fact is that in retrospect,&nbsp;after having been subjected to cruel treatment by the&nbsp;Egyptians, they had forgotten about the good years and felt&nbsp;as if they had only just arrived there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “with Yaakov.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איש וביתו, </span><span class="font5">“man and wife.” We know this from Genesis 46,26: מלבד נשי בני יעקב, “in addition to the wives of Yaakov’s&nbsp;sons.” (Genesis 46,26) Yaakov was aware that the Egyptians&nbsp;were deeply involved in promiscuity. He was afraid that his&nbsp;offspring would learn to copy these ways of the Egyptians.&nbsp;He had therefore married them off before they could do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reuven, Shimon; </span><span class="font5">the Torah first mentioned the&nbsp;two oldest sons of Yaakov’s senior wife Leah, before&nbsp;mentioning any of the sons of the concubines; this is why it&nbsp;also mentioned Joseph and Binyamin before the sons of&nbsp;Bilhah, another concubine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ירך יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov’s loins,” it is good manners to&nbsp;describe the sexual organ not directly, but by reference to an&nbsp;organ located close to it instead. (Ibn Ezra) We find this also&nbsp;in the oral Torah when the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah</span><span class="font5"> 13 writes that&nbsp;the principal organ that a woman is jealous of in her rival is&nbsp;the ירך; the author avoids naming the vagina. On other&nbsp;occasions, the word: רגלים is used as a substitute for the&nbsp;vagina. Compare Samuel II 19,25 ולא עשה רגליו, translated as&nbsp;“he had not pared his toe nails,” which is not really what the&nbsp;prophet had in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יוצאי ירך יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov’s descendants;” he himself was not included in the count.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעים נפש</span><span class="font5">, “seventy persons.” This verse was written primarily to tell of G’d’s miracles, to remind the reader that&nbsp;whereas only 70 persons of Yaakov’s family migrated to&nbsp;Egypt, after 210 years over 600000 male adults between the&nbsp;ages of 20 and 60 left Egypt, presumably at least two and a&nbsp;half million people in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויוסף היה במצרים</span><span class="font5">, “and Joseph had already been in Egypt. Concerning the Hebrews that came with Yaakov, the&nbsp;expression used by the Torah is “הבאים מצרימה,” (verse 1)&nbsp;whereas concerning Joseph, although he had already been&nbsp;there for years, he was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">included</span><span class="font5"> in the “family”: moving to&nbsp;Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכל הדור ההוא, </span><span class="font5">“and that entire generation.” This&nbsp;verse refers to both Israelites and gentiles, as we read&nbsp;immediately afterwards: ויקם מלך חדש על מצרים </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אשר לא ידע את</span><span class="font5">&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “a new king ascended the throne in Egypt, one who had&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font5"> known Joseph.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובני ישראל פרו וישרצו. </span><span class="font5">“in the interval, the Israelites&nbsp;had been fruitful, and become prolific;” this confirms that&nbsp;G’d’s promise to Yaakov that his family while in Egypt would&nbsp;become numerous and develop into a nation had been&nbsp;fulfilled. (Genesis 46,3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותמלא הארץ אותם</span><span class="font5">, and the land became full of them.” The word אותם here must be understood as if the Torah had&nbsp;written: מהם, “filled </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> them.” Seeing that the root of the&nbsp;word אותם is את, “with,” this is not strange at all. Compare&nbsp;Leviticus: 22,28, אותו ואת בנו, “it and its young.” We also find&nbsp;the word את on occasion as meaning: “from,” as in Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">9,29, when Moses says: כצאתי את העיר, meaning: “when I go&nbsp;out </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font5"> the city.” Another example would be: חלה את רגליו,&nbsp;“being sick from his feet and up.” (Kings I 15,23.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקם מלך חדש</span><span class="font5">, “a new king arose.” Some&nbsp;commentators, citing the fact that the death of the previous&nbsp;king has not been reported, claim that the Torah speaks&nbsp;about the same King (body), but that his attitude </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;Israelites underwent such a change that he might as well&nbsp;have been a different king altogether. Examples of the verb&nbsp;קום, “to arise,” being used in this sense can be found in Job&nbsp;24,14: לאור יקום רוצח, “the murderer arises with the light;” or&nbsp;Psalms 27,12: כי קמו בי עדי שקר, “for false witnesses have&nbsp;taken the stand against me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר אל עמו</span><span class="font5">, “he said to his people: he initiated this&nbsp;new policy. Our sages in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> foliol 1, state that&nbsp;there were three advisors of this king who were discussing&nbsp;how to preempt a saviour of the Israelites who would take&nbsp;them out of their land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[We must remember that a “people” who had come to Egypt only about 100 years previously, numbering only&nbsp;twelve families, and who had meanwhile multiplied and not&nbsp;only not assimilated, but had come to be viewed as an&nbsp;existentialist threat to the original Egyptians, were known to&nbsp;have a powerful G’d, and the Egyptians had made a point to&nbsp;know the source of this people’s strength. They had studied&nbsp;the traditions of that “people.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most radical advisor of Pharaoh among the three advisors, Yitro, Job and Bileam, was the latter who advised&nbsp;Pharaoh to commit genocide. Some of you my readers may&nbsp;wonder how Bileam, could have been alive still in the days of&nbsp;Balak when he had already been a senior advisor of&nbsp;Pharaoh, before Moses had been born even? This question&nbsp;is especially relevant in light of the tradition according to&nbsp;which Bileam was thirty three years old? He was still alive&nbsp;when the people killed him in the war against Midian in the&nbsp;40<sup>th</sup> year in the desert, at which time Moses was almost 120&nbsp;years old! According to the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> folio 106,&nbsp;when a heretic asked a Rabbi how old Bileam was when he&nbsp;was killed he was told that he was 33 or 34 years old, based&nbsp;on the fact that the wicked supposedly do not even reach the&nbsp;halfway mark of a normal lifespan of 70 years. The Rabbi&nbsp;who had given this answer had not been accurate, as he had&nbsp;based himself on the statement by Mar de </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">brey de Ravino</span><span class="font5"> to&nbsp;his son, a scholar in the immediate post Talmudic period,&nbsp;according to which although we are asked to report historic&nbsp;events accurately, Bileam is an exception, as if one can find&nbsp;a way to make him look worse even than he was, we have&nbsp;full latitude to do so. There is an opinion according to which&nbsp;the Bileam who was an advisor to Pharaoh was not the same&nbsp;as the one we encounter in the Book of Numbers. The one&nbsp;mentioned here was the grandfather of the one who blessed&nbsp;the Jewish people in Numbers. There is also an opinion&nbsp;according to which there were three men who hatched the&nbsp;plot to seduce the Israelites to engage in sexual relations&nbsp;with the daughters of Moav, but that this had nothing to do&nbsp;with what is reported here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,10. והיה כי </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">תקראנה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> מלחמה</span><span class="font5">, “it will be when war will break out, etc.” the word תקראנה refers to an unforeseen and&nbsp;unplanned event. One example in the Bible is Leviticus 10,19&nbsp;when Aaron refers to the sudden death of two of his sons as&nbsp;such an event. The fact that the plural mode is used here is&nbsp;nothing exceptional, as we also find it again with this word in&nbsp;Numbers 10,9 when the use of the trumpets as a means of&nbsp;giving the alarm is discussed, i.e.וכי תבואו מלחמה, instead of&nbsp;וכי תבא מלחמה, “when war will come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the Torah here abbreviates instead of writing: כי תקראנה קורות מלחמה, “when warlike&nbsp;events will occur.” We find another verse with such&nbsp;grammatically unusual construction in Proverbs 15,22: וברב&nbsp;יועצים תקום, “when there are numerous counselors they will&nbsp;prevail.” The Hebrew word for “they will prevail is in the&nbsp;singular mode instead of in the plural mode as we would&nbsp;expect. When Bileam refuses to retract the blessings he&nbsp;gave to the Jewish people in Numbers 23,21 we also find&nbsp;such a grammatically puzzling construction. We have to&nbsp;imagine that the wording is: וברך </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ברכה</span><span class="font5"> לא אשיבנה, “a blessing&nbsp;once pronounced I cannot retract.”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונוסף גם הוא על שונאנו, </span><span class="font5">“and that in such an event, it (the Israelite nation), would make common cause with our&nbsp;enemies.” The word: שונאנו, literally meaning: “our enemies,”&nbsp;in reality refers to the Egyptians themselves. It is a figure of&nbsp;speech avoiding mentioning oneself in connection with a&nbsp;curse, as doing so is considered a bad omen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;למען ענותו בסבלותם</span><span class="font5">, ‘in order to oppress them with&nbsp;forced labour;” in this instance this is a veiled reference to&nbsp;diminishing the labourers’ ability of engaging in marital&nbsp;intercourse due to being overworked. [The Egyptians’&nbsp;purpose was to control the Jewish birthrate explosion. Ed.]&nbsp;We find an example of the use of the verb ענה in this context&nbsp;in Genesis 31,50 where Lavan warns Yaakov against&nbsp;denying his daughters marital relations by sleeping with other&nbsp;women instead. Our sages also used this expression in this&nbsp;context when they are quoted as accusing the Egyptians of&nbsp;doing this in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Haggadah</span><span class="font5"> of Passover. It is paraphrased&nbsp;there as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פרישות דרך ארץ</span><span class="font5">, “abstention from marital relations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.12. כן ירבה וכן יפרוץ</span><span class="font5">, “so it would increase even more and multiply even more.” This was in line with G’d’s promise&nbsp;to Yaakov that his descendants would greatly multiply in&nbsp;Egypt. He told him not to worry about going to Egypt.&nbsp;(Genesis 46,3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובכל עבודה בשדה, </span><span class="font5">“in addition to all manner of work&nbsp;in agriculture.” They had to plow, to plant seed, to harvest&nbsp;and prune trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את כל עבודתם</span><span class="font5">, in addition with all their other work inside the urban areas, everything was under harsh conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שפרה, פועה</span><span class="font5">, some commentators claim that there&nbsp;were many midwives in Egypt, as it is impossible to believe&nbsp;that the two mentioned here could look after all the wives of&nbsp;600000 adult males.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראיתן על האבנים, </span><span class="font5">you are to closely inspect the birth stools. Pharaoh gave the midwives a sign how to recognise if&nbsp;the approaching birth would be that of a male baby or a&nbsp;female. If a male, the face would be turned downwards and if&nbsp;a female the baby’s face would be looking upwards, as each&nbsp;would do during marital intercourse. [This editor finds it hard&nbsp;to believe that professional midwives needed instruction on&nbsp;this subject from Pharaoh. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אם בן הוא והמיתן אותו</span><span class="font5">, “if it is a son, you are to kill him;“ when the Egyptians realised that they could not prevent the&nbsp;Israelites from continuing to increase at an alarming rate,&nbsp;they decided to at least kill their males who might grow up&nbsp;and fight them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואם בת היא וחיה, </span><span class="font5">“but if it is a daughter, let her live;” women are not in the habit of fighting during a war. They&nbsp;therefore did not need to be afraid of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וייטב אלוהים למילדות</span><span class="font5">, “G’d dealt kindly with the&nbsp;midwives.” How did this “goodness” of G’d become evident?&nbsp;Pharaoh did not suspect that the midwives had deliberately&nbsp;let the boys live, but he figured that the contribution by two&nbsp;midwives to the increase in the Israelite population would not&nbsp;be significant, in light of the many Jewish mothers that were&nbsp;giving birth all the time. Therefore he accepted their&nbsp;explanations at face value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויעש להם</span><span class="font5">, “He made for them;” we find in many&nbsp;places in the Torah that the masculine pronoun is used when&nbsp;the subject happens to be feminine. [The word for “for them”&nbsp;should have been: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">להן,</span><span class="font5"> seeing that the subject, the midwives&nbsp;were feminine. Ed.] To quote just two examples of similar&nbsp;occurrences: Genesis 31,9: ויצל אלוקים את מקנה, “G’d saved&nbsp;the livestock of your father,” </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אביכם</span><span class="font5"> where the grammatically&nbsp;correct word should have been: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אביכן</span><span class="font5">. Or, Exodus 2,17: ויבאו&nbsp;הרועים </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ויגרשום</span><span class="font5">, “the male shepherds came and chased them&nbsp;(the daughters of Yitro) away.” The correct word should have&nbsp;been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ויגרשון</span><span class="font5">. There are many examples of a similar kind&nbsp;throughout the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בתים, </span><span class="font5">literally, “houses,” but that word is a substitute for “families,” in this instance. The children of human beings are&nbsp;often referred to as בית, as we find in connection with David&nbsp;Samuel II 7,11: והגיד לך ה' כי בית יעשה לך , “the Lord has told&nbsp;you that he will let you have children.” [The author follows</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">this with more examples. Ed.] Here too, the midwives gave birth to sons, including such people as Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation of our verse: The subject in the verse is not G’d, but Pharaoh, who set apart houses for the&nbsp;midwives from which they were not to depart. Instead of their&nbsp;visiting expectant mothers, these were brought to the&nbsp;midwives for treatment when their due date drew near. This&nbsp;would facilitate male babies being drowned forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,22. לכל עמו, </span><span class="font5">“to his whole nation;” seeing that Pharaoh&nbsp;saw that the midwives had not co-operated with him, he now&nbsp;ordered every Egyptian to drown each new born male baby.&nbsp;At this point the objective was to drown the eventual saviour&nbsp;of the Jewish people as the astrologers had predicted that&nbsp;nation would be struck by water. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’mot Rabbah 1,18).&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">[According to my version first the King demanded that all&nbsp;pregnant </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Egyptian</span><span class="font5"> mothers be kept under his care for nine&nbsp;months to make sure the intended saviour of the Jewish&nbsp;nation would be killed. When the people refused to believe&nbsp;that an Egyptian could become the saviour of the Jewish&nbsp;people, he re-interpreted the astrologers’ forecast by saying&nbsp;that the saviour of the Jews would save them by means of&nbsp;turning water into their grave. He therefore restricted the&nbsp;decree to apply only to sons born by Jewish mothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל הבת תחיון</span><span class="font5">, “and allow all the daughters to live.” This was why only the male Egyptians who pursued them after&nbsp;the Exodus were drowned and not the females.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,1. וילך איש</span><span class="font5">, Rabbi Yehudah son of Bizna in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 12, is quoted as saying: “why does this verse&nbsp;commence with the word: וילך, “he went?” [The word seems&nbsp;superfluous. Ed.] Answer: “he took the advice of his&nbsp;daughter.” We had been taught that when Amram, eventually&nbsp;Moses’ father, heard of the decree that all male babies had&nbsp;to be drowned, he divorced his wife so that he would not&nbsp;produce a child that would be drowned. When his daughter&nbsp;Miriam heard of his reasoning, she accused him of being&nbsp;worse than Pharaoh who only wanted to kill male Jews,&nbsp;whereas he would prevent the birth of any Jews if the people&nbsp;were to follow his example. Not only that, she said, but&nbsp;Pharaoh deprived the Jews only of life in this world, on earth,&nbsp;whereas her father’s policy would also deprive them of their&nbsp;share in the world to come. Amram saw the logic of his&nbsp;daughter and </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">went</span><span class="font5"> and re married Yocheved, the wife he had&nbsp;just divorced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nonetheless, according to the plain meaning of the text, what is reported here as Amram getting married to Yocheved&nbsp;and siring Miriam and Aaron, took place prior to the decree of&nbsp;Pharaoh to drown Jewish boy babies; however seeing that&nbsp;the Torah was interested in reporting to us what transpired&nbsp;later, it commenced with telling us about when Amram got&nbsp;married first and to whom, i.e. a daughter of Levi, many&nbsp;years his senior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,2. ותרא אותו כי טוב</span><span class="font5">, “and when she saw (realised) that he was good (healthy) etc.” seeing that Moses was born to&nbsp;his mother after a pregnancy that had lasted only six months,&nbsp;she noted when examining the baby in detail, that all of&nbsp;Moses’ fingernails and toe nails were fully developed just like&nbsp;those of a baby after a nine month pregnancy, she realised&nbsp;that he was healthy and would survive the critical months&nbsp;ahead of him. She had no problem hiding him for three&nbsp;months as she had not been due to give birth during that&nbsp;period. When she was asked about the baby she had born&nbsp;by her neighbours, she would say that she had already&nbsp;complied with the kings’ decree and had thrown him into the&nbsp;Nile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation views the word טוב as a hint that Moses had been born without a foreskin. The custom of&nbsp;reciting the line: הודו לה' כי טוב, “praise the Lord for He is&nbsp;good,” is recited during the circumcision ceremony, as a&nbsp;reminder that Moses did not need to be circumcised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותצפנהו שלשה ירחים</span><span class="font5">, “she hid him for a period of three months.” Precisely during which three months did she hide&nbsp;him? Moses was born on the seventh day in the month of&nbsp;Adar, so that his mother hid him for twenty-three days during&nbsp;that month; she hid him during both the month of Nissan and&nbsp;lyar, so that the last day of the three months was the sixth&nbsp;day of Sivan, the date on which in due course, the Torah&nbsp;would be revealed to lsrael.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why the Torah makes an issue of the mother of Moses hiding him for three months is that the&nbsp;Egyptians had decreed that the last of those days would be&nbsp;the day on which the Jewish saviour would be born. By&nbsp;rights, they should have cancelled the decree to drown&nbsp;Jewish boy babies, but seeing that they did not do so, shows&nbsp;that hatred of the Jews, more than fear of a Jewish saviour&nbsp;was their principal concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,3. ולא יכלה עוד הצפינו</span><span class="font5">, “and she could not hide him any longer;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> she had given birth to him one&nbsp;day into the seventh month of her pregnancy. The Egyptians&nbsp;had demanded to examine her on the day following. If you&nbsp;were to ask that according to the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> 12&nbsp;Yocheved was already 3 months pregnant when her&nbsp;husband re-married her, how could Moses have been born&nbsp;after a six month pregnancy? We must therefore say that the&nbsp;Egyptians examined her already after six months after she&nbsp;had remarried. This would be nine months after she had&nbsp;become pregnant from her husband. The Egyptians knew&nbsp;that sometimes babies are born and survive after being born&nbsp;during the seventh month of pregnancy. Moses, on the other&nbsp;hand, was born three months after Yocheved had been&nbsp;remarried. This is why she could not hide him for longer than&nbsp;an additional three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תיבת גומא</span><span class="font5">, a basket made from the kind of reeds that grew along the banks of the river Nile and served as&nbsp;camouflage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותחמרה</span><span class="font5">, “she made it waterproof from the inside;” the letter ה at the end does not have a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dagesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובזפת, “</span><span class="font5">and she tarred it from the outside;” if the bitumen had been on the outside, the waters would dissolve it&nbsp;gradually. She had intended to recover Moses from there as&nbsp;soon as he had been examined and not been found pregnant&nbsp;anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על שפת היאור, </span><span class="font5">“by the banks of the river.” She had been unable to step into the Nile waters to completely cover that&nbsp;basket and hide him from all directions. She could only hide&nbsp;him so that he could not be seen by river traffic passing by.&nbsp;This is why the daughter of Pharaoh did not discover him&nbsp;until she had descended to actually bathe in the river. Her&nbsp;servant maids walking alongside the river bank did not see&nbsp;the basket. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5">.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,5. לרחוץ על היאור</span><span class="font5">, “to bathe in the waters of the river; other examples of the word על meaning “in,” instead of “on,&nbsp;or above,” are found in: Genesis 27,40 על חרבך תחיה, “you will&nbsp;live with the use of your sword.” Also Exodus 12,7: על הבתים&nbsp;אשר יאכלו אותו בהם, “in the houses that they will eat it in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונערותיה, “</span><span class="font5">and her servant-maids</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">this is mentioned here as the Torah shortly will refer to a specific servant maid&nbsp;who went to take the basket in which Moses was lying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">הולכות,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> “</span><span class="font5">walking</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> while interpreting the word as meaning “walking towards her death,” quotes a traditional&nbsp;explanation in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> 12 according to which it is&nbsp;short for “being on a path which leads to death,” as in&nbsp;Genesis 25,32, where Esau is quoted as saying: הנה אנכי </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">הולך</span><span class="font5">&nbsp;למות, “here I am pursuing a path that will result in my death;”&nbsp;The scholar in the Talmud has the servant maids warning the&nbsp;daughter of Pharaoh who was actually going to use the&nbsp;waters of the Nile as a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mikveh,</span><span class="font5"> ritual bath, in order to cleanse&nbsp;herself from the desecrations that were a daily occurrence in&nbsp;her father’s palace, by warning her that even when other&nbsp;people might disregard the king’s command surely his own&nbsp;daughter would not dare do so? They warned that by doing&nbsp;so she would condemn herself to death by execution. When&nbsp;hearing what her maid-servants had said to Pharaoh’s&nbsp;daughter, the angel Gavriel struck them so that they fell to&nbsp;the ground. At this point there surfaces a divergence of&nbsp;opinion between two scholars, one saying that the word&nbsp;אמתה, as distinct from the word נערות for the servant maids&nbsp;used by the Torah previously, refers to the servant maid who&nbsp;had been spared by the angel, as it is not fitting for a&nbsp;princess to remain without at least one of her attendants. The&nbsp;other scholar does not understand the word אמתה as “her&nbsp;servant maid,” but as “her arm,” i.e. the arm of the princess&nbsp;which had been miraculously lengthened to the extent of&nbsp;about 2,5 meters for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> for reasons of a grammatical nature, rejects the second opinion offered in the Talmud, saying that if correct&nbsp;the letter מ in that word would have to have a dot, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dagesh</span><span class="font5"> in&nbsp;it. He adds that further proof is the fact that the letter א in the&nbsp;word is vocalised with an abbreviated vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chataf patach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותפתח ותראהו </span><span class="font5">“she opened (the basket) and she&nbsp;saw him;” who is the subject of the suffix הו in this line?&nbsp;Seeing that at that point Pharaoh’s daughter did not yet know&nbsp;if the infant was an abandoned girl or an abandoned baby&nbsp;boy, the word ילד, is used which is neutral. After she opened&nbsp;the basket, she realised that it was a crying baby boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis: she suddenly noticed an older boy crying, i.e. Aaron, seeing that he was the brother of the baby&nbsp;in the basket. Noticing Aaron, she immediately came to the&nbsp;conclusion that the baby boy in the basket must be one of&nbsp;the Hebrews. Our sages, commenting on the fact that the&nbsp;baby Moses is once called ילד, and once נער in the same&nbsp;verse, teaches that his mother had made a wedding canopy&nbsp;inside that basket. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sotah</span><span class="font5"> 12) She did so as she worried she&nbsp;might not merit seeing him get married.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.7</span><span class="font5">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מן העבריות, “from amongst the Hebrew wet nurses.&nbsp;Egyptian wet nurses would refuse to nurse Hebrew children.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Avodah Zarah</span><span class="font5"> 26).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותלך העלמה</span><span class="font5">, “the young lady went, etc.” The reason&nbsp;why the Torah calls her by the description עלמה, is because&nbsp;she concealed the fact that she was the baby’s sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;היליכי</span><span class="font5">, some commentators claim that this word is&nbsp;from the root הלך as in הולכה, the letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">י </span><span class="font5">taking the place of&nbsp;the letter ו. Similar examples occur with the mode: ,היטיבי&nbsp;.היניקי</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והניקהו לי</span><span class="font5">, “and nurse him for me.” The letter ק has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik</span><span class="font5"> under it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,12. ותקרא שמו משה</span><span class="font5">, “she named him: Moses.” According to our sages this proves that she converted (by&nbsp;immersing herself in the Nile) to Judaism and learned the&nbsp;Hebrew tongue.) She commemorated the miracles of his&nbsp;having been saved from the waters of the Nile by expressing&nbsp;this in her choice of name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the daughter of Pharaoh did not know any Hebrew, but the plain meaning of the text is&nbsp;that his mother Yocheved called him Moses. When the&nbsp;daughter of Pharaoh wanted to know the meaning of this&nbsp;name, she explained to her that in Hebrew the word משה&nbsp;derived from המשכה, means drawing something, pulling it</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">When hearing this, the daughter of Pharaoh agreed&nbsp;wholeheartedly with the name given to this infant, for in her&nbsp;own words: “I have pulled him out of the water.” She added&nbsp;that in the future she hoped that what she had done for that&nbsp;infant he would do for others when he would grow up.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Midrash hagadol)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,12. וין* את המצרי</span><span class="font5">, “he struck the Egyptian (dead).” He found that he had committed a capital offence according to&nbsp;the seven laws that all of mankind must obey. His offence&nbsp;was that he had raped someone else’s wife, and the Torah&nbsp;had forbidden this when writing in Genesis 2,24: ודבק באשתו,&nbsp;“he is to cleave to his wife,” and not to the wife of another&nbsp;man. (According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tossaphot, Kidushin</span><span class="font5"> 21.) There was no&nbsp;need to warn that Egyptian beforehand in order to make him&nbsp;culpable for the death penalty as we derive from Genesis&nbsp;20,3: “you are going to die on account of the woman (Sarah&nbsp;whom you have taken captive)”, and Avimelech had not first&nbsp;received warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויטמנהו בחול</span><span class="font5">, “he buried him in the sand.” Apparently there was sand at hand which was meant to be used in&nbsp;construction of houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,14. מי שמך לאיש שר ושופט</span><span class="font5">, “who has appointed you as lord or judge?” The word איש here was a reference to Moses’&nbsp;youth, to the fact that he was below the minimum age for&nbsp;having risen to such a position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,16. ולכהן מדין שבע בנות</span><span class="font5">, “and the priest of Midian was father of seven daughters;” Yitro was the High Priest in&nbsp;Midian, and the Torah had to explain that the reason none of&nbsp;his sons was tending his livestock was the fact that he only&nbsp;had daughters. Another explanation: Yitro had dissociated&nbsp;himself from paganism, and after that no one was willing to&nbsp;tend his flocks after he had been officially ostracized by his&nbsp;townsfolk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,20. למה עזבתן, </span><span class="font5">“Why did you abandon him?” According&nbsp;to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> when Yitro heard that the waters from the well had&nbsp;risen at the approach of Moses, he realised that this man&nbsp;was someone special. The expression דלה דלה לנו, implies&nbsp;that the waters rose towards them as a result of Moses’&nbsp;assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתן את צפורה בתו למשה</span><span class="font5">, “He gave his daughter&nbsp;Tzipporah to Moses (as a wife.)” What is the significance of&nbsp;the name “Tzipporah?” She had run towards Moses like a&nbsp;bird (צפור)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: she was beautiful as the morning at the time of sunrise. She lit up the atmosphere in&nbsp;the morning. The Aramaic word צפרא means: “morning;” it is&nbsp;used to describe how </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">welcome</span><span class="font5"> the morning is. Our author&nbsp;quotes Ezekiel 7,7 “the day is near,” as well as Judges 7,3:&nbsp;as a bird flies from Mount Gilad,” to support his point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותלד בן</span><span class="font5">, “she gave birth to a son;” there is no&nbsp;mention of her having been pregnant first; this is to tell us&nbsp;that she remained looking like an unmarried virgin, slim&nbsp;throughout her pregnancy. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pessikta Zutrata)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקרא את שמו גרשום</span><span class="font5">, “he called his name Gershom.” If we were to be judgmental, Moses should have given his son a&nbsp;name that reflected his miraculous escape from Pharaoh and&nbsp;his police. Moses did not mention this until his second son&nbsp;was born whom he called appropriately “Eliezer,” i.e. “My G’d&nbsp;Who is my helper.” We may explain this as Moses feeling&nbsp;that as long as Pharaoh was still on the throne he was still in&nbsp;danger regardless of where he had found temporary refuge.&nbsp;We see proof of this when G’d told him in Exodus 4,19 that&nbsp;all the people who had sought his death had died in the&nbsp;meantime. This meant that the Pharaoh whom he had known&nbsp;had died also. Immediately Moses heard this he responded&nbsp;when his second son was born. Compare 4,24 where Moses&nbsp;is punished while at the inn for having delayed circumcision&nbsp;of his second son, seeing that he was no longer in danger as&nbsp;G’d had told him. [This suggests that Eliezer may have been&nbsp;as much as 50 years younger than his older brother. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: when Gershom had been born Moses was still a newcomer in Midian, and he felt like an&nbsp;alien there. If he had called the first son Eliezer, he would&nbsp;have endangered himself by hinting that he had needed to&nbsp;escape from Egypt as a common criminal and had only been&nbsp;saved by Divine intervention. By the time Eliezer was born,&nbsp;he felt at home in Midian, hence the time had come to thank&nbsp;the Lord for his deliverance from danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,23. ויהי בימים הרבים ההם</span><span class="font5">, “It was during these many years, etc;” the reference is to the 400 years that G’d had&nbsp;told Avraham that it would take before His promise to him&nbsp;that his descendants would be redeemed from the land in&nbsp;which they would be slaves would be fulfilled. The Jewish&nbsp;people in Egypt now felt that the time for them to be&nbsp;redeemed had arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הרבים ההם</span><span class="font5">, “these many.” When times are bad (for the people under discussion) then the expression for “many”&nbsp;used in the Torah is רבים. When times are good, even for a&nbsp;long period, they are referred to as מעטים, “few.” The reason&nbsp;is that as soon as the good times are over, the people who&nbsp;have enjoyed them consider them as having been too short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וימת מלך מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “the King of Egypt died.” G’d advanced the time of his death. As soon as that king had died, G’d&nbsp;appeared to Moses at the thorn bush and told Moses to go&nbsp;back to Egypt. Seeing that all the people who had been&nbsp;interested in killing him or seeing him killed had died already,&nbsp;(4,19) G’d did not want Moses to be in a position of refusing&nbsp;the leadership of the Jewish people due to fears for his&nbsp;personal safety. He had already found sufficient arguments&nbsp;to decline G’d’s request as we will read shortly, without&nbsp;raising the subject of his personal fear. He went as far as&nbsp;telling G’d to look for someone else. (4,13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאנחו בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “the Children of Israel were groaning;” they were well aware that their G’d had decreed a period of&nbsp;400 years of mixed bondage and being treated as aliens at&nbsp;the time He concluded the covenant of the pieces with&nbsp;Avraham in Genesis chapter 15. They had mistakenly&nbsp;thought that the period of 400 years commenced from the&nbsp;day that covenant had come into force. They did not know&nbsp;that if they had paid close attention to the wording of that&nbsp;covenant, they would have realised that the countdown </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">could&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">not have started until the day Yitzchok was born, as the&nbsp;promise was not to him (Avraham) but to Avraham’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">descendants</span><span class="font5"> (Compare Genesis 15,4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the reason why the Israelites are described as groaning at this point: As long as the old&nbsp;king had been alive, they had hoped that with his death the&nbsp;harsh decrees against them would “die” also. When they&nbsp;found out that they had hoped in vain, they groaned and&nbsp;prayed to G’d, as they were on the verge of giving up hope.&nbsp;[This was the first time in 86 years that they prayed to G’d.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,24. את נאקתם</span><span class="font5">, “their moaning;” they complained about&nbsp;the physical abuse they had to endure from the Egyptian&nbsp;taskmasters. Compare 3,7: ואת צעקתם שמעתי מפני נוגשיו, “and I&nbsp;have heeded their outcry because of their taskmasters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויזכור א־לוהים את בריתו</span><span class="font5">, “G’d remembered His covenant;” part of the covenant had been the promise that the people&nbsp;maltreating the Israelites would be punished by Him.&nbsp;(Genesis 15,14) The period of 400 years since the birth of&nbsp;Yitzchok had now come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,28. וירא א-להים את בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “G’d saw the Children of Israel;” the words “He saw,” mean that “He paid attention to&nbsp;what He saw.” He paid attention to their suffering. Other&nbsp;examples of similar constructions in the Torah are: Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">33,12, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ראה,</span><span class="font5"> אתה אומר אלי, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">See,</span><span class="font5"> You say to me;” or Exodus&nbsp;12,13: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">וראיתי</span><span class="font5"> את הדם, “when I see the blood, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וידע א־להים</span><span class="font5">, “G’d knew.” A construction similar to Proverbs 27,23: ידוע תדע פני צאנך, “make sure that you know&nbsp;the looks of your flocks;” G’d summoned His mercy in order&nbsp;to react to their problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis of the repeated name of G’d here: the expression וירא א-להים, refers to G’d seeing what the&nbsp;Egyptians were doing to the people publicly; the expression&nbsp;וידע א-להים, refers to G’d seeing what they were doing to the&nbsp;Israelites where no one saw it. This is also how our sages in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Haggadah shel Pessach</span><span class="font5"> understand this verse, i.e. the&nbsp;first expression refers to the Egyptians making it almost&nbsp;impossible for the Israelites to maintain marital relations. The&nbsp;second expression tells the reader that although due to the&nbsp;intimate and private nature of having marital relations there&nbsp;were no witnesses to these sufferings, G’d goes on record&nbsp;that He is a living witness. Nothing can be concealed from&nbsp;Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אחרי המדבר</span><span class="font5">, “beyond the desert.” [Presumably&nbsp;Moses went beyond the desert to avoid encroaching on&nbsp;privately owned land for Yitro’s sheep to graze on. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">חרבה, “near Mount Chorev;” this is about 3 days’ march from the border of Egypt, as we know from Exodus 5,3,&nbsp;where Moses asks permission for his people to offer&nbsp;sacrifices there to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> and he asks for them to be&nbsp;allowed to walk that distance, i.e. three days’ march. The&nbsp;reason why the Mountain is better known as Sinai, is&nbsp;because this is where the miracle of the burning bush, סנה&nbsp;occurred. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בלבת אש</span><span class="font5">, “in the heart of the fire;” G’d wanted&nbsp;Moses to get used to such a phenomenon so that when the&nbsp;time came for the revelation at Mount Sinai, he would not&nbsp;become frightened by either it or the lightning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מתוך הסנה</span><span class="font5">, some commentators explain that seeing that an angel is a completely disembodied “intelligence,” has no&nbsp;physical aspect at all, he could not be presented as if it had&nbsp;emanated from something etched into stone or painted onto&nbsp;something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והסנה איננו אוכל</span><span class="font5">, “but the bush was not being consumed by the fire.” This was a symbol for both Israel and the&nbsp;Egyptians. The Israelites’ enemy, Egypt, is portrayed as an&nbsp;all consuming fire, while his prey, Israel, is supposed to be&nbsp;represented by the bush that refuses to be consumed by the&nbsp;fire. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sh’mot Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 2,5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מדוע לא יבאר הסנה</span><span class="font5">, “why the bush fails to burn.” This&nbsp;is a verse that has been artificially shortened. After having&nbsp;observed that the bush had not been consumed by the fire,&nbsp;Moses wanted to investigate the reason for this, i.e. “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">why&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">does it not burn?” As it is written, it makes no sense, since&nbsp;Moses had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">witnessed</span><span class="font5"> that it </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">was burning</span><span class="font5">; he had only not&nbsp;observed the outcome of this, i.e. that the fibers would be&nbsp;turning into ash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי סר לראות</span><span class="font5">, “that he had turned to have a look;”&nbsp;whenever the expression סור appears and is followed by the&nbsp;prefix letter מ, it means that the subject of whom the verse&nbsp;speaks has distanced himself further from the phenomenon&nbsp;under discussion. Best known example: סורו ממני, ”turn away&nbsp;from me!” (Psalms 6,9) On the other hand, if the word&nbsp;following is either אל or the prefix ל, it invites the person&nbsp;addressed to come closer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;של נעליך</span><span class="font5">, “throw off your shoes.” The expression של&nbsp;is from the root נשל, “to disengage;” we find it both in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 28,40, כי ישל זיתך, “for your olives will fall off,”&nbsp;and in Deuteronomy 7,1, ונשל גוים רבים, “and He will dislodge&nbsp;many nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מעל רגלך</span><span class="font5">, “from your feet.” The reason is that you might have stepped on something unfit to be found in a holy place.&nbsp;The reason why the Torah </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">added</span><span class="font5">: “from your feet,” seeing&nbsp;we normally wear shoes on our </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">feet</span><span class="font5">, is that the word נעל also&nbsp;occurs for gloves, as in Ruth 4,7: שלף איש נעלו “where the&nbsp;translation is: נרתק יד ימינה, “sleeve of the right hand/arm.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our sages in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot</span><span class="font5"> 54 have ruled that no one may ascend the Temple Mount while wearing (leather) shoes.&nbsp;[The reason is that at a place where the reverence for the&nbsp;Temple prevails, it would like a lack of faith if one had to rely&nbsp;on shoes to be protected against snake bites, etc., instead of&nbsp;trusting in G’d to be protected. [I have seen this in&nbsp;commentary by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bartenura</span><span class="font5"> on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillat</span><span class="font5"> Ruth. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'כי המקום אשר אתה עומד וגו</span><span class="font5">, “for the place that you are standing on is sacred.” Wherever we find that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shechinah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">opens a dialogue with man, be it here, or with Joshua 5,1419, or the revelation of the Torah in Exodus 19,-21-27, the&nbsp;location is a sacred location. In other instances where G’d&nbsp;addressed prophets, the place is not automatically holy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אנכי א-לוקי אביך</span><span class="font5">, I am the G’d of your father;” by&nbsp;saying these words G’d revealed to Moses that his father had&nbsp;already died, for we have a tradition that G’d does not&nbsp;associate His Holy name to living persons, as He does not&nbsp;know if they will abandon Him before they die. The rule is: הן&nbsp;בקדושים לא יאמין, “He does not display trust even in His holy&nbsp;ones,” until they have departed life on this earth. The reason&nbsp;why G’d decided to tell Moses in this way that his father&nbsp;Am ram, who had been the leader of the Jewish people in&nbsp;Egypt, would not be used by Moses as an excuse to decline&nbsp;his appointment as his father’s successor. If Moses was&nbsp;reluctant to accept the appointment out of respect for his&nbsp;older brother, how much more would he decline out of&nbsp;respect for his father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויסתר משה פניו, </span><span class="font5">Moses hid his face; the fact that Moses hid his face at this point was the reason that he merited that&nbsp;he eventually attained a spiritual level when his own face&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">radiated</span><span class="font5"> spirituality to the degree that unless he was&nbsp;discussing Torah, the people could not bear looking at him.&nbsp;(Exodus 34,30). Compare also Numbers 12,8, where G’d&nbsp;explains this level of Moses to Miriam and Aaron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זבת חלב</span><span class="font5">, “flowing </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> milk and honey.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;צעקת בני ישראל באה אלי</span><span class="font5">, “the outcry of the Children of&nbsp;Israel has come to My attention;” if you were to say that their&nbsp;outcry was in vain, I go on record as: וגם ראיתי את הלחץ, “and I&nbsp;have also taken note of their oppression;” i.e. they are fully&nbsp;justified in their complaints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את עמי בני ישראל </span><span class="font5">“My people, the Children of&nbsp;Israel.” Another example of this formulation is found in&nbsp;Genesis 21,10, Sarah saying: עם בני, עם יצחק, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> my son,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> Yizchok.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,11. ?מי אנכי</span><span class="font5">, “what distinguishes me?” Moses answered G’d point by point in the order of what G’d had said&nbsp;to him. The question of what qualified hm to be chosen for&nbsp;this task was the answer to G’d having said to him: !לכה, “go!”&nbsp;the words: כי אלך אל פרעה, “that I should go,” was the answer&nbsp;to G’d having said to him: ואשלחך אל פרעה, “I am sending you&nbsp;to Pharaoh.” The words: וכי אוציא, “and that Lshould lead&nbsp;out,” were Moses’ reply to G’d having said to him: והוצא את&nbsp;עמי, “and lead out My people.” G’d in turn, proceeded to&nbsp;answer Moses point by point in order: כי אהיה עמך, “For I will&nbsp;be at your side,” was the answer to Moses’ question: “Why&nbsp;am I qualified etc.” The words: כי אנכי שלחתיך, “for it is I Who&nbsp;have sent you,” is the answer to Moses having said: כי אלך אל&nbsp;פרעה, “that I should go to Pharaoh;” the words: בהוציאך את העם&nbsp;הזה, were the answer to Moses having asked וכי אוציא.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,12. על ההר הזה</span><span class="font5">, “on this Mountain.” The word על here&nbsp;must be understood as “close to.” The Presence of G’d&nbsp;Himself, would tower above the Mountain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אהיה אשר אהיה</span><span class="font5">, the first word אהיה is the name of&nbsp;G’d; the second is an explanation of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">why</span><span class="font5"> G’d is called אהיה.&nbsp;In other words: the reason why My name is אהיה is because I&nbsp;am eternal, immutable. I am therefore a most reliable G’d, in&nbsp;the sense of dependable helper and saviour, as I will always&nbsp;be around. My “lifespan” is not as that word suggests a&nbsp;limited period, but I am not subject to any limitations. I will&nbsp;still be on the side of the Jewish people at the time when I&nbsp;redeem them from the sufferings in Egypt, as already&nbsp;promised by Yaakov to Joseph in Genesis 48,21. In other&nbsp;words, the name revealed to Moses here by G’d was not a&nbsp;new name. Yaakov had already been familiar with it. It is one&nbsp;of the attributes of G’d, Who has many attributes. G’d tells&nbsp;Moses that anyone who legitimizes himself as speaking of&nbsp;the G’d called אהיה, will be believed. The fact is that the&nbsp;Israelites did believe Moses when he identified himself as&nbsp;speaking in the name of this G’d, as we read in Exodus 4,31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:ויאמר עוד אל־הים אל משה: כה תאמר אל בני ישראל, </span><span class="font5">“G’d&nbsp;continued speaking to Moses, saying to him: “thus you shall&nbsp;say to the Children of Israel:” G’d told Moses that it is not&nbsp;appropriate when speaking of G’d to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">always</span><span class="font5"> refer to the&nbsp;name that G’d had just revealed to Moses. This we know&nbsp;already from a mortal king, whom the people applaud when&nbsp;shouting: “long live the king,” without mentioning the king’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">name</span><span class="font5">, as this would be discourteous. If a mortal king is not&nbsp;always referred to by his personal name, how much less so&nbsp;is it seemly to refer to the King of Kings on all occasions by&nbsp;His </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">personal</span><span class="font5"> name? Whenever anyone will speak to you&nbsp;about the Exodus from Egypt, he will refer to G’d simply as:&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> the G’d of your fathers.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Mechilta, Pischa,</span><span class="font5"> chapter&nbsp;16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ה׳ אלוקי אבותיכם אלוקי אברהם</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hashem</span><span class="font5"> the G’d of your fathers, the G’d of Avraham;” this is the source of the&nbsp;benedictions commencing with the words: ברוך אתה ה׳ אלוקינו&nbsp;ואלוקי אבותינו, אלוקי אברהם, אלוקי יצחק, ואלוקי יעקב, “blessed be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> our G’d, the G’d of our fathers, the G’d of Avraham, the G’d of Yitzchok’ and the G’d of Yaakov.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זה שמי</span><span class="font5">, “this is My (personal) Name;” G’d repeats the first אהיה in verse 14; this is also how we spell (in writing) His&nbsp;Name. G’d speaks of how He calls Himself, whereas we&nbsp;mortals, of course do not refer to Him in the first person, but&nbsp;will adjust to the third person either as י-ה-י-ה, or </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">י־ה־ו</span><span class="font5">-ה.&nbsp;(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5"> on the subject. He concludes that&nbsp;details are not to be revealed except to a category of people&nbsp;he terms: צנועים, familiar with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kabbalah.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The spelling with the letter ו instead of the letter י is explained by our author as not as unusual as we might think.&nbsp;For instance we find Yitzchok in his blessing saying to&nbsp;Yaakov as saying: הוה גביר לאחיך, where we would have&nbsp;expected: הוה בר, “be your brother’s superior.” [The letters י&nbsp;and ו possess a degree of interchangeability. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וזה זכרי לדור דור, “</span><span class="font5">and this is My Memorial for all generations.” The reference is to the second verse 15, i.e. 'ה&nbsp;אלוקי אבותיכם.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את זקני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “the elders of the people of Israel.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands the word: זקני here as referring to the&nbsp;“elders” in the sense of the leading sages; he adds that it&nbsp;would have been impossible for Moses to assemble all the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">aged </span><span class="font5">people in a nation of over 600000. Exodus 4,29, where&nbsp;a similar assembly is reported must be understood in the&nbsp;same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.17. ואמר אעלה אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “I said: ’I will lead you up, etc.’ Moses is to quote to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">them</span><span class="font5"> what G’d had said to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*ושמעו לקלן</span><span class="font5">, “they will listen to you (and believe&nbsp;you).” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that the reason that the people will&nbsp;immediately believe Moses was that they had a tradition&nbsp;going back to Yaakov according to which their eventual&nbsp;saviour would introduce himself by referring to G’d as having&nbsp;used the words: פקוד פקדתי אתכם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“I have surely remembered&nbsp;you.” (Actually, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> is not correct, as that tradition only&nbsp;went back to Joseph having used these word in Genesis&nbsp;50,25).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נקרה עלינו</span><span class="font5">, “has appeared for our sake.” The construction is similar to Psalms 44,23: כי עליך הורגנו כל היום,&nbsp;“for we are being killed daily for Your sake.” Another example&nbsp;of a similar construction is found in Psalms 69,8: כי עליב נשאתי&nbsp;חרפה, “it is for Your sake that I have been reviled;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דרך שלשת ימים</span><span class="font5">, “a distance of three days’ walk.” This is also what the Israelites did, eventually; as it is written:&nbsp;Exodus 13,20: ויסעו מסכות, “they broke camp from having&nbsp;rested at Sukkot, (1) ויחנו ביום השני, they encamped again on&nbsp;the second day, איתם בקצה המדבר(2) ב, “at Eytam” on the third&nbsp;day at the edge of the desert. (3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,19. ואני ידעתי כי לא יתן אתכם מלך מצרים להלוך</span><span class="font5">, “I know already that the King of Egypt will not permit you to go;” G’d&nbsp;revealed to Moses beforehand that Pharaoh would become&nbsp;obstinate; He told Moses this in advance so that he would&nbsp;not become discouraged over Pharaoh’s refusal. Seeing that&nbsp;in the event Moses still did become discouraged, we can&nbsp;imagine how much more discouraged he would have been if&nbsp;G’d had not foretold him that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא ביד חזקה</span><span class="font5">, “not even after I will perform nine plagues to change his mind,” as we know from Deuteronomy 34,12&nbsp;where in the last verse of the Torah, this has been repeated&nbsp;for the benefit of the next generation that had not been alive&nbsp;at the Exodus and had witnessed all this. G’d told Moses that&nbsp;only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> the tenth plague when He would slay all the&nbsp;firstborn of and in Egypt, would Pharaoh finally relent and&nbsp;even </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">expel</span><span class="font5"> the Israelites. (verse 20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תלכו ריקם, </span><span class="font5">“you will not go out empty handed.”&nbsp;The Egyptians will supply you with three different kinds of&nbsp;parting gifts: silver, gold, and garments, all in order to keep&nbsp;My promise to Avraham in Genesis 15,14: “and at the end&nbsp;they will depart with great material wealth.” Another example&nbsp;of a similar construction is found in the legislation&nbsp;commanding the owner of a Jewish slave at the end of his&nbsp;term of service, to grant him as parting gift, some livestock,&nbsp;some grain, and some grapes or wine. (Deuteronomy 15,14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושאלה אשה</span><span class="font5">, and a woman will ask for, etc.;” the&nbsp;Torah does not use the word ושאלה here as “a loan,” [as&nbsp;misunderstood by all the gentiles reading a translated text of&nbsp;the Torah Ed.] but they will ask for this as an outright gift.&nbsp;Another example of the word שאל being used to describe an&nbsp;outright gift is found in Psalms 2,8: שאל ממני ואתנה, “ask it of&nbsp;Me and I will grant (it).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושאלה אשה</span><span class="font5">, the men would also demand valuables; the reason that the Torah emphasizes the women doing so, is&nbsp;simply that for women it is more customary to ask for jewelry,&nbsp;etc; this is also why the Torah when speaking of witchcraft&nbsp;mentions a witch, מכשפה, in Exodus 22,17 as having to be put&nbsp;to death, although a male engaging in witchcraft is, of&nbsp;course, subject to the same penalty. It is simply a fact that&nbsp;women engage in that activity far more often than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כלי כסף וכלי זהב ושמלות</span><span class="font5">, “silver and golden trinkets, as well as garments They claimed that they needed these in&nbsp;order to celebrate their religious holiday in style.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונצלת</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את מצרי</span><span class="font5">ם, “as a result of which you will strip Egypt bare.” These “gifts” would compensate the people for the&nbsp;many years they had performed slave labour without&nbsp;compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא ישמעו בקולי, </span><span class="font5">“they (the people) will not listen to&nbsp;me (Take me seriously).” if you were to argue that there is a&nbsp;contradiction here, G’d having told Moses that they will have&nbsp;faith in Him in 3,18, the answer is that Moses argues that&nbsp;they will not believe that Moses is His prophet, but is an&nbsp;impostor. This sounds heretical, as G’d had told Moses in&nbsp;3,18 that they will listen to him and believe in him? The&nbsp;answer is that G’d had spoken of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">elders</span><span class="font5">, whereas here&nbsp;he had been asked to instruct the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">people</span><span class="font5"> who were asked to&nbsp;believe that the Egyptians would hand over all their&nbsp;valuables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">?</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מזה בידך, </span><span class="font5">“what is this in your hand?” The word מזה&nbsp;is to be read as if it had been spelled in two words, i.e. מה זה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,8. והאמינו לקול האות האחרון</span><span class="font5">, “they will believe in the effect of the (sound) of the last miracle.” Healing the skin&nbsp;disease of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> was so unheard of that it would convince&nbsp;the people that Moses had been sent by G’d as only He&nbsp;could do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיו לדם ביבשת</span><span class="font5">, “and it (the waters) will turn into&nbsp;blood as soon as it hits the dry ground.” This water, once it&nbsp;had turned into blood on the ground, would not revert to&nbsp;become water again even when the plague had ended. This&nbsp;would serve as proof to the Egyptians that this phenomenon&nbsp;had had its origin in heaven. Anything that is manipulated by&nbsp;witchcraft etc., is reversible. Here we are dealing with real&nbsp;blood. (as opposed to the waters that had remained in the&nbsp;river or lakes)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בי אדוני, </span><span class="font5">this is the name of G’d spelled with the&nbsp;letters א-ד-נ-י; (not permitted to erase)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא איש דברים אנכי</span><span class="font5">, this verse is incomplete, and it must be understood as follows: “Please, O Lord, I have not been a&nbsp;man of eloquent tongue since my birth already.” By saying&nbsp;that he was not eloquent “yesterday, i.e. אתמול,” it follows that&nbsp;earlier, i.e. “the day before yesterday,” i.e. שלשום, I had been&nbsp;even less eloquent. I have also not become more eloquent&nbsp;since My Lord has seen fit to speak to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If we were to take the text at face value, how would we explain that Moses proceeds first backwards in time, i.e.&nbsp;“yesterday and the day before yesterday,” and then jumps to&nbsp;the present? He should have said: “I am not eloquent since&nbsp;You spoke to me, nor have I been eloquent the day&nbsp;previously, nor the day before that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גם מאז דברך אל עבדך, </span><span class="font5">“neither since You have spoken to Your servant.” He meant to tell G’d that having been worthy&nbsp;to be addressed by G’d had not enabled him to henceforth&nbsp;speak more eloquently, (or distinctly).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי כבד פה ובד לשון </span><span class="font5">אנכי, “for I suffer from a speech handicap.” He implies that this handicap has been his ever&nbsp;since he was forced to flee from Egypt. [I believe that our&nbsp;author feels uncomfortable with implying that Moses would&nbsp;have criticised G’d for having been born with this handicap.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,11. מי שם פה לאדם </span><span class="font5">“Who has provided man with a mouth to speak with?” G’d replies that since it is He Who has&nbsp;given man the power of speech when He created the&nbsp;species, it was He who has given or restricted his power of&nbsp;speech. Clearly, if it was His will to do so, He could correct&nbsp;his handicap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d, as previously, answers Moses point by point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלם, “</span><span class="font5">dumb</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,” </span><span class="font5">this is spelling out the first of the faculties that G’d has equipped the human species with, i.e. speech;&nbsp;חרש, refers to the ability to hear sounds. [Thus far G’d&nbsp;mentions physical faculties. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">פקח, “intelligent;” the reason why this faculty is inserted here </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the sense of sight, is that although both hearing&nbsp;correctly and seeing correctly, are merely physical functions,&nbsp;they require the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">abstract</span><span class="font5"> faculty of intelligence to become&nbsp;meaningful to a human being. Compare: Isaiah 42,20: ולא&nbsp;תשמור פקוח אזנים ולא ישמע, “with ears open he hears nothing.”&nbsp;Or: verse 7 in the same chapter of Isaiah: לפקוח עמים עורות,&nbsp;“opening eyes deprived of light.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או עור</span><span class="font5">, “or blind?” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands this as a question concerning who made the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Egyptians</span><span class="font5"> blind when Moses fled&nbsp;and as a result of their blindness they did not find him. He&nbsp;bases himself on Exodus 2,15: וישמע פרעה, “Pharaoh heard,”&nbsp;but he could not see. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Pharaoh’s&nbsp;executioner’s sword was blunted by Moses’ neck becoming&nbsp;rock hard. (Jerusalem Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot</span><span class="font5"> chapter 9,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachah</span><span class="font5"> 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,12. עם פיך, </span><span class="font5">“I will heal your handicap so that you can&nbsp;speak clearly and distinctly. “When Moses realised that all&nbsp;his objections thus far had been useless, including the hints&nbsp;he gave G’d concerning his basic unfitness due to his speech&nbsp;defect, he revealed that his real reason was that he did not&nbsp;want to deprive his older brother, the first born Aaron, of that&nbsp;honour. He knew that Aaron was an eloquent orator. This is&nbsp;why he concluded with the suggestion that G’d should&nbsp;appoint Aaron who during Moses’ many years of being in&nbsp;Midian had been the leader of the Jewish people. He&nbsp;phrased it by saying: “please send the one that You have&nbsp;seen fit to send up to now, as long as it is not I.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At that point, G’d became angry (verse 14) pointing out that Aaron would be very </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">pleased</span><span class="font5"> to accept the mission G’d&nbsp;would appoint him to become His spokesman. He will be&nbsp;very happy to meet Moses again, and to hear that his brother&nbsp;Moses had become a prophet. He would not be jealous of&nbsp;him at all, as Moses had unfairly suspected. At this point,&nbsp;Moses accepted the mission and set out to perform it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,13. </span><span class="font5">ויאמר בי א-דוני, the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">adonay</span><span class="font5"> is again the name&nbsp;of G’d spelled with אד.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישב אל יתר חותנו, </span><span class="font5">“Moses returned to his father-inlaw Yeter.” (Yitro) He returned from the desert where he had&nbsp;the encounter at the thorn bush, in order to bring Yitro’s flock&nbsp;back to him. He had no idea when he would return to Midian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר ה׳ אל משה במדין</span><span class="font5">, “G’d spoke to Moses while&nbsp;he was still in Midian; after G’d had first spoken to Moses in&nbsp;the desert, He now spoke to him again in Midian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי מתו כל האנשים וגו</span><span class="font5">׳׳, “that all the men (who sought his death) had died in the meantime; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> identifies these two&nbsp;men as Datan and Aviram of the tribe of Reuven. [This is&nbsp;problematic as these same people conspired against him&nbsp;with Korach about 2 years after the Exodus. (Compare&nbsp;Numbers 16,1) Ed.] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> knew this of course; what he&nbsp;meant was that in the meantime these two men had become&nbsp;blind, and according to the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nedarim</span><span class="font5"> 64, blind&nbsp;people are considered as if dead already. They had the&nbsp;effrontery to accuse Moses of trying to scratch out the eyes&nbsp;of the seeing. Compare Numbers 16,14. There are 3 other&nbsp;categories that the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nedarim</span><span class="font5"> quoted are&nbsp;considered as dead, the ones smitten with the skin disease&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> the childless, as well as the poor. Seeing that Datan&nbsp;and Aviram are reported as having children, and seeing that&nbsp;they had not been ostracised outside the camp, they had to&nbsp;be either blind or poor, or both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning of the text, G’d had referred to the Egyptians who sought Moses’ death, the ones&nbsp;biologically related to the Egyptian whom Moses had slain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקח משה את אשתו ואת בניו</span><span class="font5">, “Moses took his wife&nbsp;and his sons;” seeing that both of his sons were still very&nbsp;young and in need of constant attention by their mother, their&nbsp;mother is mentioned here first, whereas when Yaakov fled&nbsp;from his uncle Lavan and father-in-law in Genesis 31,17, his&nbsp;sons are mentioned before his wives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישב ארצה מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “he returned headed for Egypt.” He now continued his journey alone. After the angel, (G’d’s&nbsp;messenger), had shown him that G’d had been displeased&nbsp;that Eliezer had not yet been circumcised, Moses left his&nbsp;family there (at the inn), and continued on towards Egypt.&nbsp;After Eliezer had recovered from his circumcision, Tzipporah&nbsp;and children returned to her father in Midian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את מטה האל-והים</span><span class="font5">, “the staff of G’d.” This staff had not yet been renamed as “Moses’ staff” because he had not yet&nbsp;performed miracles with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ראה כל המופתים, </span><span class="font5">“look at all the miracles, etc.” only&nbsp;one of the three miracles that Moses had performed thus far,&nbsp;he performed before Pharaoh, i.e. the staff turning into a&nbsp;vicious snake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואני אחזק את לבו</span><span class="font5">, “I will harden his heart;” this does not mean that G’d deprives Pharaoh of the ability to become a&nbsp;penitent and to reverse his attitude and co-operate with G’d’s&nbsp;commands if he so wills it. The line must be understood as&nbsp;follows: “I will give him additional courage so that seeing My&nbsp;miracles he will not die from fright until all My miracles will&nbsp;have been performed.” This is also how we must understand&nbsp;Exodus 73: ואני אקשה את לב </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פרעה, “</span><span class="font5">I will toughen Pharaoh’s&nbsp;heart</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">he will not collapse from fear.” If you needed proof for&nbsp;this interpretation consider Exodus 9,15: כי עתה שלחתי את ידי&nbsp;ואך אותך, “for now I will stretch out My hand and smite you&nbsp;with pestilence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בני בכורי ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “My firstborn son, Israel.” All of&nbsp;G’ds creatures are His children. However, Israel is the most&nbsp;beloved of His children as when He created mankind the&nbsp;species, it was for the sake of eventually there being a nation&nbsp;like Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: When Yaakov (Israel) purchased the birthright from Esau and he eventually acknowledged that&nbsp;he had deserved it, I had been instrumental in this, and until&nbsp;Aaron became a priest the Temple service was meant to be&nbsp;performed by the firstborn. This is why I demand that you&nbsp;release My firstborn son to perform the service fore me in the&nbsp;desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.23</span><span class="font5">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you keep refusing to release My firstborn, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הנה&nbsp;אנכי הורג את בנך בכורך</span><span class="font5">, “I am going to kill </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> firstborn.” G’d&nbsp;explains to Pharaoh that His system of meting out justice is&nbsp;based on the punishment fitting the crime. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds that&nbsp;here we find G’d already predicting that noncompliance will&nbsp;eventually result in the tenth plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי בדרך למלון, </span><span class="font5">“it was while they had been on the&nbsp;way, at an inn; this verse ought to have been appended to&nbsp;verse 20 where we were told: ויקח מה את אשתו ואת בניו,&nbsp;“Moses took his wife and his sons;” it is similarly out of place&nbsp;as is Exodus 21,36 שלם ישלם “he is to pay double,” really&nbsp;belongs in verse 37 in that chapter. The reason why it is&nbsp;written where it is, is that the Torah did not want to interrupt&nbsp;what G’d had been saying to Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויפגשהו</span><span class="font5">, “he encountered him;” the expression is remindful of Hoseah 13,8: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אפגשם כדב שכול</span><span class="font5">, “I attack them like&nbsp;a bear robbed of its young.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבקש להמיתו</span><span class="font5">, “he attempted to kill him;” according to Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel, the angel attempted to kill&nbsp;Eliezer, the uncircumcised baby. (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nedarim</span><span class="font5"> 32) This&nbsp;is why Tzipporah called her son Eliezer a “groom acquired&nbsp;through blood” (of circumcision). [She meant that if </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">she </span><span class="font5">had&nbsp;not circumcised him she would have lost him. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the angel tried to kill Moses. He had been guilty of not circumcising Eliezer on the eighth&nbsp;day of his life as G’d had commanded that it be done. He&nbsp;should have done so and left him with his mother in Midian.&nbsp;This would have enabled him to carry out the mission&nbsp;entrusted to him by G’d without delay and without hold ups&nbsp;due to consideration of the needs of his family. Instead he&nbsp;had walked slowly while his family was riding. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Nedarim</span><span class="font5"> 31)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבקש המיתו, </span><span class="font5">according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> the reason for Moses’ punishment was not that he had not circumcised Eliezer on&nbsp;the way, but that this was not his first concern when arriving&nbsp;at the inn. To the question that seeing that neglecting to&nbsp;perform circumcision carries a very severe penalty, as&nbsp;opposed to delaying his trip to Egypt which was only the&nbsp;slight delay in performing a positive commandment,&nbsp;something that normally is not even punishable at all, so why&nbsp;did Moses indeed not perform the commandment of&nbsp;circumcision on time? The answer is that it is not the father of&nbsp;the child that is subject to this penalty, but the uncircumcised&nbsp;male when he is old enough to arrange for his own&nbsp;circumcision if his father failed to do so. The Torah spells this&nbsp;out when writing: וערל זכר אשר לא ימול בשר ערלתו ונכרתה, “when&nbsp;a male with a foreskin allows his foreskin not to be&nbsp;circumcised he will be cut off, etc.” (Genesis 17,14) This is&nbsp;why Moses was not bothered by attending to other details&nbsp;about his family’s accommodation </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> attending to&nbsp;circumcision of his son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,25. </span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותקח צפורה וגו</span><span class="font5">, “Tzipporah took etc.” what prompted Tzipporah was that her husband had been&nbsp;weakened by the attack of that angel so that he, personally,&nbsp;was unable to perform this commandment. He therefore&nbsp;revealed to his wife what had to be done, and she performed&nbsp;the deed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">צר, </span><span class="font5">a sharp scalpel. Compare Joshua 5,2 חרבות צורים, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the word צר means “stone;” we find it as having this meaning also in Ezekiel 3,9: כשמיר&nbsp;חזק מצור, like a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shamir,</span><span class="font5"> “even harder than rock.” She took&nbsp;what was at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותגע לרגליו</span><span class="font5">; “she touched his male member.” This is another word being used to describe the area of it where the&nbsp;circumcision had to be performed. We find another occasion&nbsp;where the word: רגליו has been used in the same sense in&nbsp;Samuel II 19,25: לא עשה רגליו, “he had not attended to his&nbsp;private parts.” It is necessary to rephrase this verse so that it&nbsp;means: “Tzipporah took a scalpel and applied the sharp edge&nbsp;of it to the male member of her child and she cut off his&nbsp;foreskin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation: the subject in the word: לרגליו are the angel’s feet. She considered what she had done as a&nbsp;kind of sacrifice to G’d, and placed it (the foreskin) at the feet&nbsp;of G’d’s representative, in this case, the angel. We find&nbsp;something similar to this when Gideon as well as Manoach in&nbsp;the Book of Judges, placed their “sacrifice” at the feet of the&nbsp;angel. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessikta</span><span class="font5"> de </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zutrata</span><span class="font5"> on Exodus 12,13 at&nbsp;length on this subject).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(ותאמר (אל משה</span><span class="font5">, “she said: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי חתן דמים אתה לי, </span><span class="font5">“for you are a bridegroom to me on account of the circumcision.” She&nbsp;attributed the fact the Moses had almost be killedn to herself,&nbsp;i.e. as being her fault for having married her, a Midianite,&nbsp;something not appropriate for Hebrews to do. She&nbsp;considered herself as inferior to Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,26. וירף ממנו</span><span class="font5">, “he let him alone;” after Tzipporah had performed the circumcision on her son, the angel left. and no&nbsp;longer tried to kill Moses; at that point Tzipporah understood&nbsp;what it had been that caused her husband to almost have&nbsp;been killed, i.e. the fact that Eliezer had remained&nbsp;uncircumcised until then. This is the reason why she had not&nbsp;referred to the word למולות, “on account of circumcision,” in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">previous</span><span class="font5"> verse where she first described herself a&nbsp;bridegroom of blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: As long as Moses and Tzipporah had lived in her father’s house, Moses had not&nbsp;been punished for not having circumcised Eliezer because&nbsp;his father-in-law would have tried to prevent him from doing&nbsp;so. Compare Yonathan ben Uzziel on the subject who&nbsp;attributes the fact that Moses’ grandson became an idolater&nbsp;to the fact that Gershom had not been circumcised as part of&nbsp;an agreement between Moses and his father-in-law that one&nbsp;of his sons could be circumcised but not the other. The&nbsp;reason that the angel tried to kill Moses was on account of&nbsp;Tzipporah, who had </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">opposed </span><span class="font5">his circumcision before.&nbsp;(Compare Judges 18,30, and the commentators there)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nonetheless most people understand the matter as being the non circumcision of Eliezer, not Gershom. At the&nbsp;same time no one has attempted to either explain (away) the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aggadah</span><span class="font5"> of Moses having made a deal with his father-in-law&nbsp;concerning the subject of circumcision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to counter that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on verse 2,16 has already stated that Yitro had abandoned idolatry so how&nbsp;could he have opposed Moses’ circumcising his son, I&nbsp;believe that this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> need not be understood literally, i.e.&nbsp;Yitro had not converted to Abrahamitic monotheism, but had&nbsp;become what we call “a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ger toshav”</span><span class="font5"> a proselyte who had&nbsp;accepted the seven basic laws G’d gave to mankind. He&nbsp;himself had certainly not circumcised himself, in the opinion&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי חתן דמים אתה לי, </span><span class="font5">“for you are a bridegroom of blood to me.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the word דמים should be understood&nbsp;as in שופך דמים, “spilling blood, killing. Compare Samuel II&nbsp;16,7 צא איש הדמים, “get out murderer!” The verse ought to be&nbsp;rearranged so that it is understood as: כי דמים חתן אתה לי, “you&nbsp;were (potentially) a shedder of the blood of my groom for&nbsp;me.” (Alternately, these words could have been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">addressed</span><span class="font5"> to&nbsp;her baby Eliezer, meaning that the baby if not for the blood of&nbsp;his at the circumcision, it would have caused her groom’s&nbsp;death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,27. ויפגשהו וישק לו</span><span class="font5">, “when he met him, he kissed him. (Aaron kissed Moses.)” This is alluded to in Psalms 85,11&nbsp;חסד ואמת נפגשו, צדק ושלום נשקו, “loving kindness and truth&nbsp;meet; righteousness and peace kiss one another.” (Compare&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’mot Rabbah Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 5,10.) [The commentators on </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> have different views of what the author meant. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Basically, our sages describe Aaron’s predominant characteristic, virtue as that of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chessed,</span><span class="font5"> leniency, whereas&nbsp;Moses’ predominant characteristic was truth, justice.&nbsp;Similarly, Moses was distinguished by insisting on&nbsp;righteousness, whereas Aaron strove for preserving or&nbsp;making peace where at all possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our author also quotes Maleachi </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2,6</span><span class="font5"> בשלום ובמישור הלך אתי, “he walked with Me in peace and equity” as relevant to&nbsp;Aaron’s stature. [The whole chapter discusses the priests.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,28. ויגד משה לאהרן</span><span class="font5">, Moses told Aaron all that had transpired since he last saw him many years ago, including&nbsp;the fact that he had brought his wife and children with him on&nbsp;this journey, until the very first inn. Upon hearing this, Aaron&nbsp;told him that there were already far too many Israelites&nbsp;suffering in Egypt, and he did not need to increase their&nbsp;number by bringing along his family. We may assume, as did&nbsp;our sages, that this prompted Moses to send his family back&nbsp;to Midian to her father’s home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,30. ויעש האותות</span><span class="font5">, “Moses performed the three miracles;” the staff turning into a snake, his hand becoming&nbsp;smitten with the skin disease known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> and turning&nbsp;water into blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,1. </span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואחר באו משה ואהרן אל פרעה ויאמרו וגו, “</span><span class="font5">and after this&nbsp;Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and said: “this line is the&nbsp;basis of the liturgist’s poem in the Shabbat morning prayer of&nbsp;the Shabbat before Passover after the line: חי וקים נורא וקדוש&nbsp;שמו, inserting his poem commencing with the words: ירדת&nbsp;להצל עמך, “You descended in order to save Your people.”&nbsp;Among other lines it contains the phrase: יכנס הבא במנה, a&nbsp;reference to the day when Moses and Aaron went to see&nbsp;Pharaoh without an appointment apparently. It was on the&nbsp;day when Pharaoh was being crowned, and when advised&nbsp;that two elderly men stood outside waiting to be admitted,&nbsp;Pharaoh thought that they must have come to pay him&nbsp;homage. When asked about their message, they replied that&nbsp;the G’d of the Hebrews commanded Him to release the&nbsp;Hebrews to serve Him in the desert. The expression ויחגו&nbsp;which occurs here for the first time is familiar to us from the&nbsp;line: אסרו חג בעבותים, (Psalms 118,27) “bind the festival&nbsp;offering!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,3. ויאמרו</span><span class="font5">: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלוקי העברים</span><span class="font5">, they said in response to Pharaoh denying that there was a G’d called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> or a&nbsp;people called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Israel),</span><span class="font5"> “the G’d of the Hebrews sits in&nbsp;judgment of His people as they are supposed to be His&nbsp;servants and His people.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: Pharaoh was not included in what Moses and Aaron said, but if the G’d of the Hebrews&nbsp;were to kill us, he, Pharaoh, would not only lose their work&nbsp;for a few days, but that he would lose the work of the Hebrew&nbsp;slaves permanently and irrevocably; thus it would be in his&nbsp;interest to grant their request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">בדבר </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או בחרב</span><span class="font5">, “either through pestilence or the sword.” Here Moses already hinted for the first time that G’d had told&nbsp;him to warn Pharaoh of fatal consequences, i.e. the death of&nbsp;the firstborn if he were to refuse to obey His commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points that out when he says on 4,23 that Moses warned Pharaoh already of the last plague on his first&nbsp;encounter with him</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,4. </span><span class="font5">!</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכו לסבלותיכם, </span><span class="font5">“go back to your labours! “The reason why the tribe of Levi had been exempted from&nbsp;performing slave labour when the Egyptians first began to&nbsp;enslave the Israelites was that Pharaoh pretended to share&nbsp;that burden with them in order to encourage them to perform&nbsp;these labours for patriotic reasons, building fortifications&nbsp;against potential invaders. This is how the sages interpreted&nbsp;the word: בפרך in Exodus 1,13, i.e. as meaning: בפה רך,&nbsp;“spoken softly.” Pharaoh had appealed to their loyalty and&nbsp;told them that by performing this labour they could prove that&nbsp;they were loyal Egyptians citizens. The Jews of then [as we&nbsp;know only too well from all the Jews serving in the German&nbsp;Kaiser’s army in the first world war, 12000 of them giving&nbsp;their lives for the aggressive designs of Germany, Ed.] were&nbsp;only too eager to prove their loyalty, not suspecting how they&nbsp;would be exploited. At that time the tribe of Levi remembered&nbsp;what their founding father Yaakov had said to them on his&nbsp;death bed, that Levi was not to be one of his pall bearers as&nbsp;that tribe was destined in the future to carry the Holy Ark on&nbsp;its shoulders. They therefore declined at the time to&nbsp;participate in the building of fortifications, and Pharaoh did&nbsp;not make an issue of this as also the Egyptians had a caste&nbsp;of priests who Joseph during the years of famine had&nbsp;completely excused from any taxation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, we found a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> according to which Avraham already taught his son Yitzchok the whole Torah&nbsp;(the written Torah that would be given to the Israelites in the&nbsp;desert) Yitzchok in turned transmitted it to Yaakov, and&nbsp;Yaakov to Levi, who in turn transmitted it to his direct&nbsp;descendants. Seeing that these people had not learned any&nbsp;vocation, they were not physically suitable to perform the&nbsp;kind of physical labour the other tribes were used to. They&nbsp;were therefore rewarded by G’d not to have to share this&nbsp;burden with their brethren. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> by&nbsp;Rabbi M. Kasher item 32 on our verse.) According to that,&nbsp;Pharaoh told Moses and Aaron not to try his patience and be&nbsp;content that they, being Levites, were not required to do&nbsp;slave-labour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,7. לא תאספון, </span><span class="font5">“ you must not continue!” the letter א תאספון is not to be read, (as it would mean changing the&nbsp;meaning of the word beyond recognition).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,9. ואל ישעו בדברי שקר</span><span class="font5">, “let them (the Israelites) not pin their hopes on falsehoods.” According to Ibn Ezra, the&nbsp;meaning of ישעו is derived from the root שען, the letter נ being&nbsp;missing here. The meaning is: “to lean on something for&nbsp;support.” Examples quoted are: השע ממני Psalms 39,14: “look&nbsp;away from me; (do not count on me for support)” also Isaiah&nbsp;22,4 השע ממני. “leave me alone!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,12. ויפץ העם בכל ארץ מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “the people spread out throughout the whole land of Egypt.” We know from Genesis&nbsp;11,3-4, that straw was needed to make mud bricks. The&nbsp;search for straw to build the Tower led to G’d punishing&nbsp;those people once, and here, indirectly, it provides G’d with&nbsp;the justification to punish the entire Egyptian nation. Up until&nbsp;the time when Pharaoh issued the decree to withhold straw&nbsp;from the people, only few Egyptians had been directly&nbsp;involved in mistreating them. Now that the Israelites had to&nbsp;forage for straw wherever they could find some, and they&nbsp;were beaten if the did not deliver the required number of&nbsp;bricks daily, the entire Egyptian people had become involved&nbsp;in abusing the Jewish people, both men and women. G’d&nbsp;“inspired” Pharaoh to come up with the idea of withholding&nbsp;straw so as to eventually being justified to issue a decree&nbsp;which to some might have been viewed as collective&nbsp;punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,14. גם תמול</span><span class="font5">, “also yesterday;” on the day when Moses&nbsp;performed the miracles, and the people on account of that&nbsp;did not perform their daily routine, גם היום, as well as to day,&nbsp;when Moses and Aaron had gone to speak to Pharaoh, (and&nbsp;they were awaiting the results of that conversation.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,19. ויראו שוטרי בני ישראל אותם ברע.</span><span class="font5">” The Hebrew&nbsp;supervisors of the labourers of the Children of Israel saw that&nbsp;they were in an untenable situation;” we read earlier that their&nbsp;Egyptian superiors had pressured them to change the routine&nbsp;by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> withholding straw </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font5"> insisting on the daily number&nbsp;of bricks remaining the same, thus making their brethren’s&nbsp;lives even more intolerable; they therefore rather absorbed&nbsp;physical punishment themselves than becoming partners to&nbsp;Pharaoh’s overseers through pressuring the Israelites.&nbsp;Pharaoh had told them that no straw would be given to them&nbsp;to distribute to their brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הבאשתם את ריחנו</span><span class="font5">, “you have made us loathsome in&nbsp;the eyes of Pharaoh, etc.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Did Moses then not know from what G’d had already told him that Pharaoh would not be responsive? G’d had told&nbsp;him explicitly in Exodus 3,19, that Pharaoh would not&nbsp;consent to let the Israelites go? Moses had thought that while&nbsp;Pharaoh would not consent to let the Israelites go, at least he&nbsp;would lighten their burdens. This is why he added in&nbsp;frustration that instead of a marginal improvement in the&nbsp;Israelites’ sorry state, it had now worsened dramatically due&nbsp;to his intervention! This is why he added (improperly) “and&nbsp;You have certainly not saved Your people!” He quoted G’d&nbsp;as having said: “I’ll descend and save it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d responded that “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font5"> you will see,” as from now on I shall commence applying pressure to him via My plagues.”&nbsp;They will soon feel a drastic reduction in their suffering.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands the line as “I am the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">One</span><span class="font5"> who is certain to reward and punish as and when required.” If you&nbsp;were to ask how the 4-lettered tetragram conveys that G’d&nbsp;rewards and punishes, and that this applies to this attribute&nbsp;of His more so than to any other attribute, this is the meaning&nbsp;when He explained in Exodus 3,14-15 that the very fact of&nbsp;His being eternal, and enjoying a full view of past and future&nbsp;developments, “this enables Me to mete out both reward and&nbsp;punishment equitably as I can foresee the implications of all&nbsp;of My actions.”</span></p>

In answering the question&nbsp;why He had not done so, what comes to mind is first: “they&nbsp;did not bother to ask Me about it.” [They should have asked&nbsp;as I revealed Myself to Avraham as such already at the&nbsp;covenant between the pieces in Genesis 15,7, where G’d&nbsp;told Avraham that He had saved him miraculously in order to&nbsp;give him (his descendants) that land in which He appeared to&nbsp;him. G’d reminds Moses that neither Avraham nor Yitzchok&nbsp;or Yaakov, to all of whom He had spoken far less that He&nbsp;had to Moses, ever questioned what they could have&nbsp;questioned about G’d’s judgments. To quote just one such&nbsp;example: when after having been told by G’d that his&nbsp;descendants would inherit the land of Canaan, and it came to&nbsp;burying his wife Sarah there, he could not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">even</span><span class="font5"> do this&nbsp;without paying a minor fortune for a cave, he surely might&nbsp;have asked Me about this. They believed Me on My word&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">alone,</span><span class="font5"> without the need for any miracles or proof. They could&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font5"> have known me by My real name, as I had made&nbsp;promises and had not yet kept them. My true name is based&nbsp;not only on My ability to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">promise</span><span class="font5"> but on My ability </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">beyond&nbsp;question</span><span class="font5"> to also keep My promises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, G’d says, “I will explain to you why I did not reveal Myself to the patriarchs as the attribute of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span><span class="font5"> The&nbsp;promises I made to them referred to a distant future.” They&nbsp;would not live to see their fulfilment. The promises I made to&nbsp;you and through you to My people, will be fulfilled within the&nbsp;immediate future. As this occurs, the past partially passive&nbsp;mode of the root ידע will be appropriate, i.e. “I will have&nbsp;become known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.”</span><span class="font5"> Seeing that this is so, the&nbsp;people should not have asked: “what is His name?” Who&nbsp;asks about something that he knows and is familiar with?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> also explains why the conjunctive letter ו in וגם in verse 4 is appropriate. The word: הקימותי is not to be&nbsp;confused with “I have kept (a promise),” but is to be&nbsp;understood as the promises made to the patriarchs still </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">being&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">effect,</span><span class="font5"> and the fact that they had not yet been fulfilled is&nbsp;due to their having been made by G’d in His capacity as שדי,&nbsp;“the G’d whose promises are meaningful because He is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">able&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">to fulfill them and no one can stop Him from doing so.” The&nbsp;reason that the time for fulfilling them has arrived is because&nbsp;the Children of Israel’s outcry on account of their suffering is&nbsp;justified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,4. וגם אני </span><span class="font5">הקימותי, Accordingly, the correct translation of the word הקימותי here is: “and also I have sworn,” exactly&nbsp;as in Genesis 3,53, where the word וישבע does not mean “I&nbsp;have sworn,” in the sense of “it is the truth,” but “I </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">confirm&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">solemnly something that I have promised already previously.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,9. ולא שמעו אל משה</span><span class="font5">, “but they did not listen (accept) what Moses had said to them;” they were too afraid to accept&nbsp;what Moses said to them on account on the recent&nbsp;worsening of their condition as a result of Moses’ intervention&nbsp;and Pharaoh’s reaction to this. Pharaoh had succeeded at&nbsp;this stage in making the people forget their dreams of&nbsp;freedom or at least improved conditions, by burdening them&nbsp;with additional hard labour. (Compare 5,9) The words דברי&nbsp;שקר, there refer to Moses’ “false promises.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,11. !בא דבר אל פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “go and </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">speak sternly</span><span class="font5"> to Pharaoh!” G’d implies that He will go </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> Moses on this&nbsp;mission. On the other hand, at the time when Moses is&nbsp;bidden to go outside instead of into the city, G’d uses the&nbsp;term: לך, as when G’d instructed Avraham to leave Charan&nbsp;and to go to a land which He would show him (Genesis 12,1,&nbsp;or G’d to Moses in Exodus 7,15) where he is told to speak to&nbsp;Pharaoh at the banks of the Nile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,13. </span><span class="font5">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל משה ואל אהרן ,“</span><span class="font5">to Moses and Aaron.” G’d took Aaron with to this interview with Pharaoh in order to put&nbsp;Moses at ease. [I fail to understand this comment by our&nbsp;author, seeing that Aaron had accompanied Moses also at&nbsp;the first interview. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation, especially on the words: ויצום אל בני ישראל, “He commanded them to the Children of&nbsp;Israel;” Moses was to tell the Israelites everything that G’d&nbsp;had said to him from the beginning of the portion until לכם&nbsp;מורשה אני ה', “for you as an ancestral land;” (in verse 8).&nbsp;Moses was to go to Pharaoh after having told the people,&nbsp;and they, Moses and Aaron, were to tell Pharaoh to release&nbsp;the Children of Israel from bondage in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,18. 'ובני קהת עמרם ויצהר וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and the sons of Kehot were Amram, Yitzhar, etc.;” the reason why the Torah does&nbsp;not mention the sons of Moses and the sons of Chevron and&nbsp;Ittamar, is that no specific action in which these had been&nbsp;involved has been recorded. The Torah did mention the sons&nbsp;of Amram, as they had been mentioned independently in the&nbsp;Torah so many times, i.e. both Moses and Aaron. The sons&nbsp;of YItzhar were mentioned on account of their involvement in&nbsp;the uprising of Korach. The sons of Uzziel were mentioned&nbsp;because they were called upon to remove the bodies of&nbsp;Nadav and Avihu who had died in the precincts of the&nbsp;Tabernacle on account of having offered unauthorized&nbsp;incense in the Sanctuary, and having added man made fire&nbsp;to their censers. The sons of Ittamar were mentioned in&nbsp;Chronicles on account of the High Priest Eli. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,20. ויקח עמרם את יוכבד דודתו </span><span class="font5">“Amram married his aunt Yocheved;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only reason that seems feasible in understanding why G’d agreed to such great people as Moses and his&nbsp;siblings to be born from a union that the Torah would forbid&nbsp;once it was revealed at Mount Sinai, is the rule that we do&nbsp;not appoint a person to the highest position in the land&nbsp;unless the people were aware of at least something&nbsp;inappropriate that such a person had been guilty of actively&nbsp;or passively before his appointment. [This rule, if enforced,&nbsp;will diminish the chances of such high ranking people&nbsp;allowing their high office to develop feelings of superiority to&nbsp;those around him. Ed.] The best known example of the rule&nbsp;is King David, one of whose ancestors was Ruth, the&nbsp;Moabite, a people with whom intermarriage is strictly&nbsp;prohibited by the Torah. [He was reminded of this repeatedly&nbsp;during his life, not only his fitness as king being questioned,&nbsp;but even his claim to be Jewish. Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">22. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,23. ויקח אהרן את אלישבע, </span><span class="font5">Aaron married Elisheva; she is mentioned by name because of the priestly status of her&nbsp;husband. (Compare Nachmanides)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מבנות פוטיאל</span><span class="font5">, of the daughters of Putiel; she is&nbsp;mentioned as she gave birth to Pinchas who was granted the&nbsp;hereditary priesthood for ever. (Ibn Ezra on Numbers 25,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הוא אהרן ומשה</span><span class="font5">, whenever Moses and Aaron are&nbsp;mentioned in context of their respective ages, Aaron is&nbsp;mentioned first as he was the senior of the two. When these&nbsp;two brothers are mentioned in context of their respective&nbsp;status amongst the people, Moses is mentioned first, as in&nbsp;verse 27. After all, Moses took out the Israelites from slavery&nbsp;in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,30. ?ואיך ישמעני פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “what is the likelihood of Pharaoh listening to me (when my own people do not)? This&nbsp;paragraph is a continuation of the previous paragraph in&nbsp;which Moses complained about the people not listening to&nbsp;him. (verse 12) [Moses attributes the reason </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> times to his&nbsp;lack of eloquence or his stammer.] The only difference&nbsp;between the two occasions is that earlier he was very brief,&nbsp;as the Torah wished to insert the passage of the ancestry of&nbsp;some of the principal characters in the hierarchy. The Torah&nbsp;takes up the thread that had been interrupted so that the&nbsp;reader is reminded of where it was interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this way the lines of ואני ערל שפתים, and ואהרן אחיך יהיה נביאך, “I am afflicted with a speech defect,” and “your brother&nbsp;Aaron will be your spokesman,” have been joined together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואני אקשה, </span><span class="font5">“and I (G’d) will toughen;” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">points&nbsp;out that during the first five plagues G’d actually did not yet&nbsp;harden Pharaoh’s heart, and the Torah only speaks about&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vayechezak lev paroh,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">meaning that Pharaoh “remained&nbsp;obstinate </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> any help from G’d.” When the Torah writes&nbsp;during the seventh plague, the plague of hail in chapter 9&nbsp;verse 35, that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vayechezak lev paroh,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">that “Pharaoh’s heart&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">remained</span><span class="font5"> obstinate,” which appears to contradict what </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">said</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">seeing that line occurs during the seventh plagu</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">this&nbsp;line appears </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> in verse 34, G’d had already hardened his&nbsp;heart. In that instance, for the first time, Pharaoh had&nbsp;admitted being guilty, and after G’d had hardened his heart&nbsp;he was able to hold out still longer in his obstinate ways. In&nbsp;chapter 10,1, G’d explains to Moses that Pharaoh’s&nbsp;behaviour from then on was understandable only because&nbsp;He had already hardened his heart. He was already no&nbsp;longer a free agent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason is simple, as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">explains. Once a person has remained obstinate in the face of five plagues clearly&nbsp;orchestrated by G’d, he is deprived of his most precious&nbsp;attribute, that of freedom of choice. Even if Pharaoh had&nbsp;freed the Israelites at that stage, G’d would not have let him,&nbsp;until He had been able to demonstrate Hjs powers&nbsp;completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא ישמע אליכם פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “and Pharaoh will not pay any&nbsp;heed to you.” This verse cannot be understood as a&nbsp;prediction of future events, as during the tenth plague&nbsp;Pharaoh did heed Moses’ and Aaron’s warnings, finally. It is&nbsp;a reminder to Moses of what G’d had told him already before&nbsp;the commencement of the plagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,6. כן עשו</span><span class="font5">, “so they did.” The fact is repeated to remind us that Moses and Aaron put their lives in danger every time&nbsp;they threatened Pharaoh with another plague if he did not&nbsp;comply with their request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,9. לכם מופת </span><span class="font5">^,”perform a miracle in order to legitimize yourselves!” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash,i</span><span class="font5"> the word מופת refers to a&nbsp;miracle that would prove </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">who</span><span class="font5"> it is that authorised Moses to&nbsp;become the redeemer of the Israelites. G’d would have to&nbsp;demonstrate not only being a Ruler, but also His capacity to&nbsp;enforce his decrees. We have a source for this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Devarim Rabbah 2,11,</span><span class="font5"> which while not exactly what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">says nevertheless approximates it. Basically, it explains why&nbsp;paganism in Jewish literature is called עבודת כוכבים אלהים,&nbsp;literally: “worshiping stars as gods,” the reason being that&nbsp;[(my choice of words), “G’d is indispensable in our universe.”&nbsp;Otherwise, the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font5"> in that expression is superfluous.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Yossi claims that these deities cannot be called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim,</span><span class="font5"> for if they were, it would follow that such a force must&nbsp;be obeyed. This is why the Torah in Deuteronomy 32,17,&nbsp;quotes Moses as referring to these so called deities as שדים&nbsp;לא אלוה, “satyrs, non deities.” Onkelos translates it as&nbsp;“something that is misleading,” as there is absolutely no need&nbsp;for it. For if there had been a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">need</span><span class="font5"> for such phenomena why&nbsp;would G’d be jealous of them?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והשלך לפני פרעה יהי </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">לתניו</span><span class="font5">, “throw it in front of Pharaoh so that it will turn into a monster.” The reason for this was that&nbsp;Pharaoh boasted of his power to the extent that G’d in&nbsp;Ezekiel 29,3 called him “the great sea monster.” The prophet&nbsp;there ridicules the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">actual</span><span class="font5"> power of Pharaoh who people were&nbsp;afraid of. Moses’ performing the miracle, was to show him&nbsp;that awe-inspiring monsters are only an illusion and can be&nbsp;turned into a stick by merely taking hold of their tail. Similarly,&nbsp;Pharaoh’s power is also only an illusion. Even though it&nbsp;appears that at this time he is all-powerful, this can change in&nbsp;the time it takes to drop a stick to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יהי </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">לתנין</span><span class="font5">, this paragraph has already appeared in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">parshat sh’mot</span><span class="font5"> 4,21 ראה כל המופתים אשר שמתי בידך ועשיתם לפני&nbsp;פרעה, “see that you perform all the miracles that I have put at&nbsp;your disposal and carry them out in the presence of&nbsp;Pharaoh;” the reason that this has been repeated here is that&nbsp;a new element has been added, that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">only </span><span class="font5">the miracle of&nbsp;turning the staff into a monster is to be performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,11. ויקרא ג</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פרעה, </span><span class="font5">“also Pharaoh called upon etc.;” what is the meaning of the word: “also” here? After all, even&nbsp;little babies can call to people for help!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,13. ויחזק לב פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “Pharaoh’s heart remained obstinate;” seeing that his sorcerers had been able to&nbsp;duplicate Aaron’s feat, he concluded that Aaron was another&nbsp;sorcerer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'כאשר דבר ה, “just as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> had said.” (when He had said: “Pharaoh will not pay heed to you.” Verse 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הנה יוצא המימה</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Pharaoh went&nbsp;to the Nile every morning in order to have his bowel&nbsp;movement, as having declared himself a deity, he could not&nbsp;allow his subjects to think that he like they had to excrete his&nbsp;undigested food daily. Seeing that the area where he&nbsp;performed this rite was a dirty area, G’d had not told Moses&nbsp;“בא אל פרעה” as if he were to dress up for an interview at&nbsp;Pharaoh’s Palace. The meaning of בא when G’d speaks to&nbsp;Moses, always implies that He is accompanying him as He&nbsp;had promised in Exodus 3,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הנה יוצא המימה, </span><span class="font5">here he is about to go out towards the Nile so as to attribute the waters of the Nile rising towards&nbsp;him proving that he was a deity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: Pharaoh would wash himself every morning in the waters of the Nile, especially in order to&nbsp;wash out any particles that had accumulated around his eyes&nbsp;during his sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation: he went for a stroll along the banks of the river every morning. He would also go hunting&nbsp;birds by means of trapping them in mud. [Maybe the&nbsp;reference is to chasing geese and ducks into traps. Ed.] The&nbsp;point of G’d’s instruction was for Moses to have a private talk&nbsp;with Pharaoh when he would not feel under pressure to show&nbsp;his ministers etc., that he could stand up to Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואמרת אליו, </span><span class="font5">“and you will say to him, etc.” some&nbsp;commentators believe that the purpose of this private talk&nbsp;and warning to Pharaoh near the river was that it was a&nbsp;ritually pure area, as opposed to his palace which was filled&nbsp;with abominations and therefore not a place where G’d’s&nbsp;sacred name is to be spoken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,17. בזאת תדע</span><span class="font5">, “by the way the punishment fits the&nbsp;crime you will know;” seeing that you have said: “I don’t know&nbsp;a deity called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> I will give you proof of the existence&nbsp;and power of such a deity.” The precise meaning of the word&nbsp;תדע here is: “you will </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">begin</span><span class="font5"> to know.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונהפכו</span><span class="font5">, “and they will be turned (into blood);” the letter ה is written with the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">7,20.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ויהפכו כל המים אשר ביאור לדם</span><span class="font5">, “all the water in the river had been turned into blood.” The river had been turned&nbsp;into blood only temporarily, and the fish died immediately on&nbsp;account of being unable to survive in a river of blood. As&nbsp;soon as all the fish had died, the river reverted to being&nbsp;water. As to the Torah having written that “the Egyptians&nbsp;could not drink water from the river,” this was not on account&nbsp;of the blood, for we do not find that they even tried to reverse&nbsp;the plague, but that was, as the Torah writes, because the&nbsp;stench of the water on account of all the dead fish. The proof&nbsp;of this is that the Torah writes: ויעשו כן כל חרטומי מצרים, “all of&nbsp;the sorcerers of Egypt performed a similar miracle;” if the&nbsp;waters had not first been restored, how could they have&nbsp;demonstrated their sorcery?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators claim that the plague lasted for slightly over a week, a quarter of a month, for all waters&nbsp;visible to the people during that period. During that period,&nbsp;the sorcerers busied themselves with subterranean water.&nbsp;Their proof is that the Torah writes that “the Egyptians dug all&nbsp;around the river to find water as they could not drink the&nbsp;water from the river.” (verse 24). The subterranean waters&nbsp;had not been turned into blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,29. ובכה ובעמך</span><span class="font5">, “and against you as well as against&nbsp;your people, etc;” the word: ובכה is to be read as if it had&nbsp;been spelled as ובך.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,1. נטה את ידך, </span><span class="font5">“extend your hand!” G’d wanted Pharaoh and the Egyptians to see that the cause of the plague was</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses, although it was Aaron who actually extended his arm with Moses’ staff over the river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">8.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותעל הצפרדע, “the frogs emerged from the river.”&nbsp;Even though the Torah uses the singular mode here, the&nbsp;meaning is that swarms of frogs came forth. We find&nbsp;something similar in Numbers 21,7 when the Torah&nbsp;describes the plague of snakes besetting the people as if it&nbsp;had been only a single snake, i.e. ויסר מעלינו את הנחש, “may&nbsp;He remove the snake(s) from us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">8.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בלטיהם, “with their spells.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">these “spells” are called such as the word means “silently,”&nbsp;they employed whispers to produce such illusions. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> had&nbsp;given this interpretation already on 7,11 where the spelling of&nbsp;the word had been slightly different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">8.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!התפאר עלי למתי, אעתיר, “have this boast over me&nbsp;about when you will release the Children of Israel, and I will&nbsp;pray for the frogs to disappear immediately!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">8.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר: למחר, he said: “for tomorrow!” He meant to&nbsp;say: “I will send your people on their way tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the word למחר refers to the disappearance of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">frogs</span><span class="font5"> on the day following. Pharaoh&nbsp;thought that the reason that Moses had asked him to&nbsp;determine when the frogs should disappear was that he&nbsp;thought that Pharaoh would, of course, wish to get rid of&nbsp;them immediately, and Moses was aware that they would&nbsp;leave without his doing anything to hasten their&nbsp;disappearance. This is why he thought he could show up&nbsp;Moses as a sorcerer by asking him to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">delay</span><span class="font5"> their departure.&nbsp;In the event he was disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ולעמך, “and for your people;” the letter מ in this word has the semi vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sheva;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Logic tells us that this plague did not last one quarter of a month. If you were to say that the conversation between&nbsp;Moses and Pharaoh took place on the sixth day of this&nbsp;plague, it does not make much sense, as the plague would&nbsp;have come to an end on the following day anyways without&nbsp;Moses praying for its removal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,9. מן הבתים מן החצרות</span><span class="font5">, “from the houses and subsequently from the courtyards,” but not the frogs that had&nbsp;ventured into the ovens and kneading bowls. Seeing that&nbsp;these frogs had risked their lives by performing such a&nbsp;dangerous mission on behalf of G’d, they were allowed to&nbsp;remain alive. Compare Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> folio 53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,12. והיו לכנים, </span><span class="font5">“they will become vermin.” These are&nbsp;the kind of vermin that are products of the dust, but only&nbsp;rarely attack human beings. They emanated from their&nbsp;customary habitat, like the frogs and other plagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,14. ולא יכלו</span><span class="font5">, “but they were unable.” Seeing that all the&nbsp;dust had turned into vermin from where would they produce&nbsp;similar kinds of vermin?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation: seeing that the sorcerers could not duplicate the plague, they tried to get rid of it. But they&nbsp;failed. There would not have been any point in adding to the&nbsp;disaster, anyways. If they had succeeded in getting rid of the&nbsp;vermin, their fellow Egyptians would have been grateful to&nbsp;them and they would have risen in their esteem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another exegesis of the words: ולא יכלו; the sorcerers were unable to remain in the proximity of Pharaoh&nbsp;as they had been smitten with vermin also, and they were&nbsp;ashamed of their impotence and withdrew. The same thing&nbsp;happened again when they were struck by the 6<sup>th</sup> plague,&nbsp;infectious boils on the skin. [It is interesting that both the third&nbsp;and the sixth plague occurred without Moses having&nbsp;forewarned Pharaoh, so that the Egyptians could have&nbsp;denied that it was a plague sent by the G’d of the Israelites.&nbsp;Ed.] According to some opinions, when the sorcerers’ feet&nbsp;were not planted directly on the earth, their power&nbsp;disappeared. If so, this would explain why the Torah wrote&nbsp;“they were powerless,” as the entire surface of the earth was&nbsp;covered with vermin preventing them from standing on the&nbsp;ground. When the sorcerers perceived their inability to get rid&nbsp;of the vermin, they admitted that this must indeed be plague&nbsp;orchestrated by heavenly forces and they said: אצבע אלו-הים&nbsp;היא that “this was a finger of G’d.” The reason of their inability&nbsp;could not have been that that their power was limited to&nbsp;creatures larger than a grain of barley as claimed by some,&nbsp;for if it were so, why were they not able to get rid of the fourth&nbsp;plague, the wild beasts roaming and destroying in urban&nbsp;areas at will?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,15. אצבע אלו־הים היא, </span><span class="font5">“it is a natural phenomenon, i.e. orchestrated by the G’d of Joseph, who had been known to&nbsp;them as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim,</span><span class="font5"> as opposed to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> whom Moses and&nbsp;Aaron had claimed to represent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אצבע אלו־הים היא, </span><span class="font5">“it is a (finger) feminine phenomenon”. [היא means “she”. Ed.] The sorcerers excused their inability&nbsp;to deal with this plague to the fact that it was something&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">natural,</span><span class="font5"> and therefore not within their domain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחזק לב פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “Pharaoh’s heart remained stubborn, strong.” The reason why Pharaoh did not ask Moses to pray&nbsp;for the removal of this plague was that this would have been&nbsp;an admission that it was a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">heavenly</span><span class="font5"> phenomenon. [Besides&nbsp;thus far none of the plagues had caused deaths, only&nbsp;inconvenience. He felt that if this is aj] that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> can do,&nbsp;he could live with it. Ed.] There was a good reason to feel&nbsp;that a plague which was common among the poor people all&nbsp;the time, had spread for some reason beyond its normal&nbsp;boundaries. Pharaoh did not realise that the absence of a&nbsp;warning meant that this was not of Moses’ doing; in fact the&nbsp;reason why he had not been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">warned</span><span class="font5"> was that he had ignored&nbsp;the warnings issued before the first two plagues, so that this&nbsp;was the punishment for having ignored those two plagues to&nbsp;influence his attitude toward the Israelite slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover, every group of three plagues, as pointed out by Rabbi Yehudah who characterised (summarised) them as&nbsp;acronyms, i.e. דצ׳ך, עד׳ש, באח׳ב, was also introduced by Moses&nbsp;as having a specific objective.(Compare Exodus 8,6: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למען תדע&nbsp;כי אין כה׳ אלוקינו </span><span class="font5">“so that you will realise that there is no G’d&nbsp;like our G’d.” Exodus 8,18: למען תדע כי אני ה׳ בקרב הארץ, “so&nbsp;that you will realise that I am the Lord right here on earth&nbsp;also.” Exodus 9,29: למען תדע כי לה׳ הארץ, “so that you will&nbsp;realise that the earth belongs to the Lord.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators explain that the reason Rabbi Yehudah summarised the plagues as he did, was to remind&nbsp;us that this was the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">correct</span><span class="font5"> order, as compared to Psalms&nbsp;78,44-51 where they are listed in a different sequence. Also&nbsp;in Psalms 105, 28-36 they are listed in a different order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">8,19. למחר יהיה, “it will occur tomorrow.” Moses does not&nbsp;want to give Pharaoh the excuse that the disappearance of&nbsp;the frogs, i.e. their deaths will be accidental, unplanned. The&nbsp;same happened with the plague of pestilence (#7) when G’d&nbsp;predicted precisely when it would occur. (Compare 9,5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">8.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זבחו לאלוקיכם בארץ, “offer meat offerings to your&nbsp;G’d inside the land of Egypt!” When Pharaoh saw that G’d&nbsp;made clear distinctions between where the plagues that&nbsp;occurred where the Israelites lived and where not, he made&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">first</span><span class="font5"> concession allowing them to offer sacrifices inside&nbsp;Egypt so that their G’d would not punish them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">8.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא יסקלונו, “are they not going to stone us to&nbsp;death?” The expression סקל means throwing stones; we&nbsp;know this from Samuel II 16,6: where David and his men&nbsp;were stoned by Shimi, a family member of King Sha-ul, who&nbsp;had been dead for while already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">8.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;דרך שלשת ימים נלך במדבר, we will go a distance of&nbsp;three days’ march into the desert;” in fact this is what they did&nbsp;at the Exodus when they made camp on the second day at&nbsp;the edge of the desert, as is described in detail in Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">13,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">8.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויכבד פרעה את לבו גם בפעם הזאת, “and Pharaoh&nbsp;hardened his heart again on this occasion.” The word גם,&nbsp;“also,” is justified, as Pharaoh had done the same during the&nbsp;plague of the frogs. (verse 11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">9,3. הנה יד ה' הויה, “here the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hand</span><span class="font5"> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> will be active;” according to normal logic there is a reason for people&nbsp;to believe and to say that neither the plague of hail or the&nbsp;plague of pestilence could have lasted for a week each.&nbsp;(death of the afflicted would have occurred immediately)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">במקנך אשר בשדה, “against your livestock that are out in the fields;” even the beasts that had been saved by their&nbsp;shepherds during the plague of the free roaming beasts&nbsp;could not stand up against the plague that follows next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,4. והפלה, “</span><span class="font5">He will make a distinction;” [the word is&nbsp;spelled with the letter ה at the end, not the letter א. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,6. וימת כל מקנה מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “all the domesticated livestock of Egypt died.” The Torah means to emphasize that all the&nbsp;livestock which died </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">belonged</span><span class="font5"> to the Egyptians. The verse&nbsp;does not mean that all the livestock </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">Egypt died, as it states&nbsp;specifically in our verse that of the livestock owned by&nbsp;Israelites not a single animal died. This is why the Torah&nbsp;could write in verse 20 that the livestock of G’d fearing&nbsp;Egyptians who had brought their beasts into shelter did not&nbsp;die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישלח פרעה והנה לא מת</span><span class="font5">, “Pharaoh dispatched people&nbsp;to check on the livestock of the Israelites, and not a single&nbsp;one had died.” The reason for this was Moses’ prediction in&nbsp;verse 4 that G’d will make this distinction between Egyptian&nbsp;and Israelite owned beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויכבד לבו; “</span><span class="font5">but his heart remained obstinate</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">he did not ask Moses to pray, as the dead beasts could not be brought&nbsp;back to life. The beasts that had survived did not need to be&nbsp;prayed for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מלא חפניכם</span><span class="font5">, “your handfuls,” this would not be&nbsp;enough soot to bring the plague on the entire land of Egypt;&nbsp;this is why the Torah does not attribute this plague as&nbsp;resulting from the fire that the soot was taken from. G’d did&nbsp;not want to change natural law at this point, and that is why&nbsp;He commanded Moses and Aaron to perform a symbolic act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פיח</span><span class="font5">, remnants of coal, cinders. Compare Isaiah 54,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וזרקו משה השמימה</span><span class="font5">, “and let Moses throw it heavenwards.” This is one of many occasions when the term שמים, usually&nbsp;translated as “heaven,” is used as meaning simply: “air, or&nbsp;atmosphere.” Seeing that what is thrown into the air&nbsp;subsequently falls to earth, just like rain or lightning, the&nbsp;description is not that inaccurate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לאבק </span><span class="font5">“into dust;” the letter ל has the semi vowel&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sheva,</span><span class="font5"> whereas the letter א has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,12. ולא שמע אליה</span><span class="font5">ם, “but he paid no heed to them.” [This was also a plague that had not been announced&nbsp;beforehand to Pharaoh. Ed.] An additional reason why&nbsp;Pharaoh paid no heed to this plague was that the boils&nbsp;proved responsive to medical treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,14. את כל מגפותי, </span><span class="font5">“</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">My plagues;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">what we are to learn from this verse (“aN My plagues”) is that&nbsp;the plague of killing the Egyptians’ firstborns is considered as&nbsp;equivalent to all the plagues. [There are different errors in&nbsp;different manuscripts of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> as a result of which it is not&nbsp;clear whether </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> spoke about the plague of hail, or the&nbsp;last </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">group</span><span class="font5"> of plagues commencing with hail and concluding&nbsp;with the slaying of the firstborn. I will not speculate, therefore&nbsp;[I omit speculations quoted by the author also. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל לבך, </span><span class="font5">“against your heart;” not only trees can be broken, but hearts can also be “broken.” This occurs when&nbsp;the heart is overwhelmed by fear. The letter ב in לבך has a&nbsp;dot, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dagesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,16. ולמען ספר את שמי בכל הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “and in order to spread My fame in the whole country, (or on the whole earth).” G’d&nbsp;continues to respond “tit for tat,” seeing that Pharaoh had&nbsp;denied His existence, not to acknowledge His power, G’d will&nbsp;make sure that he will see how wrong he had been, and he&nbsp;would have to do so publicly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,17-18. עודך מסתולל</span><span class="font5">, “seeing that you still brag about being able to thwart My people,” boasting that you can&nbsp;prevent them from leaving;” The word סולל reminds us of&nbsp;Psalms 68,5, where G’d is extolled as riding the clouds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למן היו</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוסדה</span><span class="font5">, “from the day it was founded;” the letter ה at the end is “weak,” i.e. does not have a dot. [which would&nbsp;have made it a pronoun. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,19. 'ועתה שלח העז וגו, </span><span class="font5">“and now hasten to send word to bring your cattle under cover;” this was an advice Moses had&nbsp;not given Pharaoh before the onset of the plague of&nbsp;pestilence. It is possible that the “advice” to Pharaoh to have&nbsp;his people gather in their remaining livestock is not a&nbsp;concession, but on the contrary, is an additional hardship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">People failing to take this “advice,” would experience also the death of their livestock, not only the destruction of their&nbsp;crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation: our verse proves that the plague of hail was aimed not only at trees and crops but also at&nbsp;living creatures, including human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">9.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וה' נתן קולות, “and the Lord had unleashed thunder,&nbsp;etc.,” against Pharaoh and his counselors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ותהלך אש ארצה, “and fire streamed to the ground.” From the words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">9.24, ואש מתלקחת בתוך הברד, “and fire was contained within the hail stones,” it is clear that after the hail had hit the&nbsp;ground, that this fire started conflagrations. [Otherwise who&nbsp;would have known that there was fire inside the hail stones?&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">9.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ה' הצדיק, it is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> who is righteous. During all&nbsp;of the plagues, the only one which resulted in Pharaoh&nbsp;acknowledging that G’d was righteous, hail was the only one.&nbsp;What prompted Pharaoh to make such a confession? When&nbsp;someone is at war with someone else and wants to liquidate&nbsp;him, he arranges to do this when his adversary does not&nbsp;suspect it, and he jumps him suddenly. Here, G’d, instead of&nbsp;bringing on the plague without warning, gives His creatures a&nbsp;chance to escape with their lives. He Himself urged them to&nbsp;take shelter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">9.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;קולות אלו-הים, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">heavenly</span><span class="font5"> thunder; he acknowledged&nbsp;that there is a G’d (in heaven). Seeing that he had not&nbsp;acknowledged the existence of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> Moses stressed&nbsp;that when he would pray for the plague to end, he would not&nbsp;address his prayer to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim,</span><span class="font5"> but to the tetragram, i.e. to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span><span class="font5"> (compare verse 30) When Moses, at the end of&nbsp;verse 30, combines the two names of G’d, he wants Pharaoh&nbsp;to know that these two attributes are not two </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">separate&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">deities, but that there is only one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“elohim,”</span><span class="font5"> i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You cannot argue by citing Avraham, who in Genesis 15,2 had asked: ה׳ אלו-הים מה תתן לי, “o Lord, G’d what can&nbsp;You give me?” and a few more such examples, that there&nbsp;appear to be two separate deities. In all such examples the&nbsp;reading of the word for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font5"> is the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">adonay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כצאתי את העיר</span><span class="font5">, “as soon as I leave the boundaries&nbsp;of the city;” seeing that earlier the Torah had written (verse&nbsp;19) that anyone who will still be found outdoors will become a&nbsp;target for the hail, now, at the time when the plague was in&nbsp;full swing, the people might say that Moses was afraid to&nbsp;venture outside on account of that hail, Moses announces&nbsp;that he will open his hands in prayer as soon as he is beyond&nbsp;the borders of the city, and that the hail will not stop him from&nbsp;leaving the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation for this phrase: Moses announces that as soon as he leaves the palace to go into&nbsp;the city, he will spread out his hands in prayer while inside&nbsp;the city. This is also what the Torah reports in verse 33: ויצא&nbsp;משה מעם פרעה את העיר וגו', “as soon as Moses left the&nbsp;presence of Pharaoh and went into the city, etc;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet another explanation: according to the plain meaning of the text the plague of hail was far stronger in the fields&nbsp;than in the city, [as there were no trees and grain fields&nbsp;inside the city to destroy, Ed.]. This is why Moses boasted&nbsp;that he would brave the hail and then begin his prayer as&nbsp;necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.30. ידעתי כי טרם</span><span class="font5">, “I am well aware that before you have even dismissed me you will start to really be afraid,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תיראו</span><span class="font5">ן, much more so than now;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: I am well aware that you are still not sufficiently afraid because the hail did not destroy two&nbsp;major crops, i.e. the wheat and the spelt, so that you still will&nbsp;have what to eat;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נוכתה</span><span class="font5">, “had been ruined;” the word is in the plural&nbsp;mode, as we also find in Exodus 17,12: ויהי ידיו אמונה “his&nbsp;hands were steadfast;” not ויהיו [as we might have expected;&nbsp;Ed.] or Samuel I 4,15 where after Eli’s sudden inability to&nbsp;see, his eyes are described as: עיניו קמה, not קמו or similar&nbsp;examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי השעורה אביב, </span><span class="font5">“for barley grows in spring;” what is missing here are words referring to the linking together the&nbsp;flax and the barley as the Torah linked the wheat and the&nbsp;spelt. The reason is that the farmers’ crops no matter when&nbsp;they were planted, will not ripen until later in the season. This&nbsp;is why the flax is mentioned separately. When wheat and&nbsp;spelt were sown at the same time, they will also ripen at the&nbsp;same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והפשתה גבעול</span><span class="font5">, “but the flax ripens later; if not for that fact it would have been ruined by the hail also. The Torah needed&nbsp;to spell this out as it had written that the hail struck “ail the&nbsp;grass in the field.” (verse 25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,32. והחטה והכוסמת לא נוכו</span><span class="font5">, “but the wheat and the spelt had not been ruined;” this is emphasized because later on&nbsp;(10,5) the Torah writes that the locusts will devour anything&nbsp;that the hail had not ruined. Somebody might have argued&nbsp;that what is written here has already been included in the&nbsp;words describing all the grass in the field as having been&nbsp;destroyed; in order to forestall such an interpretation, the&nbsp;Torah </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">first</span><span class="font5"> exempts the wheat and the spelt by explaining&nbsp;why these species of plants had not been ruined by the hail;&nbsp;they had been too small and soft to be affected. Basically&nbsp;speaking, hail destroys hard plants and locusts consume soft&nbsp;plants. The word אפילות</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">derived from אופל, “darkness,”&nbsp;means that the plants under discussion are as yet invisible,&nbsp;not have broken through to the air above the ground as yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,34. כי חדל המטר</span><span class="font5">, “for the rain had ceased;” seeing that Moses had only promised that the hail and the thunder would&nbsp;cease, Pharaoh said to himself that now he had proof that&nbsp;Moses was only a charlatan. Hence he continued to sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויכבד לבו הוא ועבדיו</span><span class="font5">, “both he and his servants hardened their hearts,” arguing that the G’d of the Hebrews will not&nbsp;bring on the same plague a second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא ועבדיו</span><span class="font5">, we do not find this expression anywhere else in the Bible. The only reason that it has been used here is,&nbsp;that the Torah had written in verse 30: אתה ועבדיך, “you and&nbsp;your servants,” so that here it had to match that expression&nbsp;when reporting on how correct Moses had been when he had&nbsp;said that Pharaoh and his servants were still not in awe of&nbsp;the Lord. It was especially important to contrast this with&nbsp;Pharaoh’s previous statement in verse 27: חטאתי הפעם, “this&nbsp;time 1 have sinned.” It is the usual way of confirmed sinners if&nbsp;due to extreme distress they have been forced to pay lip&nbsp;service to a confession, that as soon as the emergency has&nbsp;passed they revert to their accustomed attitudes. We know&nbsp;from their own words that they had felt hard pressed, when&nbsp;the Torah referred to such people by writing that they took&nbsp;their beast indoors to escape the plague. (Verse 20) Now&nbsp;that relief had come, they reverted to “business as usual.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,38. </span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר דבר ה</span><span class="font5">, “as the Lord had said.” G’d had said in Exodus 3,19: “I know that the King of Egypt will not permit&nbsp;you to leave.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביד משה</span><span class="font5">, by means of his prophecy that he had been instructed to proclaim. This is the meaning of the expression&nbsp;ביד משה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">wherever it occurs</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Bo</span></h1><h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בא אל פרעה כי אני הכבדתי את לבו ואת לב עבדיו</span><span class="font5">, “go to</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Pharaoh for I have hardened both his heart and that of his servants;” We have not found this formulation in connection&nbsp;with any of the previous plagues. The reason that G’d&nbsp;reacted so harshly was that after Pharaoh himself had&nbsp;confessed that he had sinned, instead of releasing the&nbsp;Israelites, both he and his servants continued to oppress the&nbsp;Israelites. This retraction by Pharaoh forced G’d’s hand, so to&nbsp;speak, to react in kind, matching the punishment to the sin&nbsp;committed. [In verse 34 at the end of the last chapter the&nbsp;Torah testified that Pharaoh’s servants had supported him in&nbsp;his retraction of his confession. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;התעללתי</span><span class="font5">, any expression of this type, when it&nbsp;commences with the letter ת describes some kind of mockery&nbsp;or ridicule on the part of the subject </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> his opponent.&nbsp;When the same word appears without the prefix ת, the&nbsp;element of ridicule is absent. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבא משה ואהרן</span><span class="font5">, Moses and Aaron arrived (at the&nbsp;Palace); the reason why the Torah did not mention during the&nbsp;other plagues that both Moses and Aaron arrived at the&nbsp;Palace together, is that Aaron had been present at every&nbsp;interview Moses had with Pharaoh. The reason that it&nbsp;needed to be stressed </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">here,</span><span class="font5"> is that shortly the Torah will tell&nbsp;us that after Pharaoh had thrown out Moses and Aaron they&nbsp;were both recalled at Pharaoh’s servants urging him to do&nbsp;so. (Verse 8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לענות מפני</span><span class="font5">, “to humble yourself before Me;” seeing that Pharaoh had boasted about the crops that the hail had not&nbsp;destroyed, [attributing it to G’d’s “weakness” Ed.] He&nbsp;retaliated in kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'כה אמר ה</span><span class="font5">, ”thus has the Lord said, etc.;” other prophecies which have been introduced with this introductory&nbsp;phrase are numerous, as are commandments (in the future)&nbsp;which have been introduced with the introductory: “thus the&nbsp;Lord has said.” The author cites: Exodus 11,5; 32,27;&nbsp;Numbers 19,2; Numbers 30,2 as well as reminding us that in&nbsp;the Books of the prophets, especially Isaiah and Ezekiel, this&nbsp;formula is used frequently. It happens several times that&nbsp;what was predicted has not later on in the text been spelled&nbsp;out as having happened; [one of the reasons is that when the&nbsp;prophecy is a warning of something unpleasant it need not&nbsp;be fulfilled if the circumstances changed. Ed.] At any rate, in&nbsp;this case it was important for G’d to show Pharaoh that a&nbsp;prophecy by Moses would be fulfilled, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">because Moses</span><span class="font5">, G’d’s&nbsp;spokesman, had said that it would. This is what Isaiah 44 26&nbsp;had in mind when he said that G’d fulfills promises or threats&nbsp;made by His servants. (Compare our author on Exodus 11,4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,5. הצומח לכם מן השדה</span><span class="font5">, ‘”which grows for you from the fields.” The hail ruined what grew on the trees; the locust&nbsp;would ruin what grows in the fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,7. ויאמרו עבדי פרעה אליו</span><span class="font5">, (after having heard this threat) “Pharaoh’s servants said to him;” when we had read&nbsp;previously in 9,34 that both Pharaoh as well as his servants&nbsp;(ministers) continued to sin, that referred to the ministers who&nbsp;had advised him </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font5"> to let only the men go into the desert to&nbsp;offer sacrifices as requested. They now questioned&nbsp;Pharaoh’s judgment by asking him if he wanted to wait until&nbsp;the whole of Egypt was ruined? They implied that if Egypt&nbsp;were to be ruined, in the end Pharaoh would have no option&nbsp;but to give in to the Israelites’ demands. Why not give in&nbsp;while Egypt was still a functioning nation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי חג לה' לנו</span><span class="font5">, “for we celebrate a festival in honour&nbsp;of the Lord;” it is customary to celebrate festivals in the&nbsp;presence of wife and children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ראו כי רעה</span><span class="font5">, “see you are planning something&nbsp;wicked;” i.e. “you are planning to escape from the land and&nbsp;all your obligations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נגד פניכם</span><span class="font5">, “it is clearly visible from your whole mien, as if written on your faces. This is why you insist on taking all your&nbsp;portable belongings with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לכו נא הגברים</span><span class="font5">, “you, i.e. the men, may go;” the&nbsp;children will remain behind as guarantees that you will return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויגרש אותם</span><span class="font5">, “he dismissed them (expelled).” The reason that Pharaoh had not expelled Moses and Aaron up until&nbsp;now, before they had been recalled, when they were not&nbsp;even allowed to leave before having been given express&nbsp;permission to do so, was because they knew that G’d would&nbsp;not bring on the same plague a second time. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sotah</span><span class="font5"> 9)&nbsp;[Pharaoh considered locusts as a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">repeat</span><span class="font5"> of the hail, as both&nbsp;plagues ruined the food supply from the earth. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על ארץ מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “on the land of Egypt.” According to&nbsp;what we would have expected, Moses should have extended&nbsp;his staff over the sea of reeds, in order call forth the locusts,&nbsp;as the locusts are found near the sea of reeds. However,&nbsp;since G’d intended for Moses to extend his staff over the sea&nbsp;of reeds at the time when the Israelites needed that sea to&nbsp;split in order to let them cross, G’d did not want the sea to&nbsp;depart from its routine for a second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;רוח קדים, </span><span class="font5">“an east wind.” It is called קדים, as this&nbsp;is where the sun begins its daily route; this is also why west&nbsp;is called אחור, “hindmost,” as this is where the sun completes&nbsp;its daily route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואחריו לא יהיה כן</span><span class="font5">, “and there will never be a plague&nbsp;of locusts kike this;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the meaning is “a&nbsp;single type of locust.” Seeing that the Bible records other&nbsp;plagues of locusts at least as severe, (Psalms 105,34, Yoel&nbsp;1,4), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> was surely aware of this, we must&nbsp;understand the words of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> as referring to a single&nbsp;species of locusts at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותחשך הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “the earth became darkened;” from&nbsp;the amount of shade produced by the flying swarms of&nbsp;locusts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'חטאתי לה</span><span class="font5">, “I have sinned against the G’d called&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.”</span><span class="font5"> He acknowledged the attribute of mercy, realising&nbsp;that this G’d had warned him before bring evil upon him;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ולכם, “and against you,” for having thrown you out of my palace in disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,19. רוח ים חזק מאד, </span><span class="font5">“ very strong westerly wind;” the east wind had brought the locusts and the west wind swept&nbsp;them away. This had been alluded to in verse 13: והרוח הקדים&nbsp;נשא את הרבה, “and the east wind had carried the locusts</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויתקעהו</span><span class="font5">, the Torah had used this verb in connection with Lavan in Genesis 31,25: ולבן תקע את אחיו and Lavan pitched&nbsp;tent with his brothers.” In other words, the wind arrested the&nbsp;flight of the locusts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי חשך</span><span class="font5">, “there will be darkness.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points&nbsp;out that this darkness was not preceded by a warning, as G’d&nbsp;did not want the Egyptians to have an opportunity to first hide&nbsp;their valuables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי חשך אפלה, </span><span class="font5">“there was a thick darkness;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">comments that the Israelites were able to see as usual and&nbsp;could find where the Egyptians kept their valuables, so that&nbsp;when the time came to ask for them they could know if they&nbsp;lied when claiming they did not possess certain items an&nbsp;Israelite had requested. This is the deeper meaning of&nbsp;Exodus 12,36: וה' נת! את חן העם בעיני מצרים וישאילום, and the&nbsp;Lord had disposed the Egyptians favourably towards the&nbsp;people and they lent them willingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהי חשך אפלה שלשת ימים ולא קמו איש מתחתיו</span><span class="font5">, “the thick darkness remained for three days so that not a single&nbsp;Egyptian even dared to rise from where he had been sitting&nbsp;on. This means that the darkness lasted a total of six days,&nbsp;Moses did not decree the plague to last one quarter of a&nbsp;month. This is also how the verse is explained in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> (according to Rabbi Chavell, this is an error); in&nbsp;Rabbi Kasher’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah Shleymah</span><span class="font5"> (item 66) a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash&nbsp;Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> is quoted which deals with the seventh day of that&nbsp;plague instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;היה אור במושבותם, </span><span class="font5">“there was light in their&nbsp;dwellings.” It is noteworthy that the Torah here does not refer&nbsp;to the province of Goshen as it had done during other&nbsp;plagues, but implies that Israelites living in other parts of&nbsp;Egypt were also not affected by this plague. Our sages claim&nbsp;that when an Israelite entered the house of an Egyptian he&nbsp;was able to see normally in that house also. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’mot Rabbah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">14,3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;רק צאנכם ובקרכם יוצב, </span><span class="font5">“only your sheep and cattle&nbsp;will stay here; as guarantee that you will return.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גם אתה תתן בידינו, </span><span class="font5">“also you will give to us,” Moses&nbsp;tells Pharaoh that not only will the Israelites take with them&nbsp;their </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">own</span><span class="font5"> livestock, but Pharaoh will give them of his own&nbsp;livestock as sacrifices to be offered by them on his behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pharaoh did not ask Moses and Aaron to pray for the removal of the darkness as he thought that surely the&nbsp;Israelites are afflicted by the same plague, and if so, prayer&nbsp;would be useless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,29. </span><span class="font5">1“ ,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא אוסיף עוד ראות פניך </span><span class="font5">will not ever see you again;” Moses meant that if there were to be any additional&nbsp;meeting between them, Pharaoh would seek </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> out instead&nbsp;of his being the supplicant. This is confirmed by the Torah&nbsp;when we read in 14,13: אשר ראיתם את מצרים, “as when you&nbsp;see Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,1 עוד נגע אחד, </span><span class="font5">“one more plague;” this paragraph was communicated by G’d to Moses and Aaron while they were&nbsp;standing in front of Pharaoh. It had to be so, as we never&nbsp;read of Moses seeing Pharaoh again. However, he received&nbsp;this communication outside the capital as we understand&nbsp;from 7,15: “here when he goes to the water (to have his daily&nbsp;bowel movement)” [this explains that Moses could not&nbsp;receive communications from G’d while in a ritually&nbsp;contaminated area. Ed.] As far as this last communication is&nbsp;concerned, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> states that G’d lifted Moses more&nbsp;than ten hand breadths from the floor of the palace in order&nbsp;to communicate with him. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> 11,27)&nbsp;After that, Moses predicted the plague of the killing of the first&nbsp;born with which G’d would smite Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,2. דבר נא</span><span class="font5">, “speak please;” Moses was to do this at&nbsp;this time as they would not have any time to do so once&nbsp;Pharaoh would discharge them unconditionally, i.e. even&nbsp;expel them. If the people had made these requests still&nbsp;earlier, Egyptians would have demanded that they would&nbsp;give back what they had borrowed, seeing that Pharaoh had&nbsp;refused to allow them to leave permanently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישאלו איש</span><span class="font5">, “they each asked for, etc.” they complied with what G’d had asked them to do, so that He could fulfill&nbsp;His promise to Avraham that after servitude to a land other&nbsp;than the land of Canaan, they would leave that country as&nbsp;free people with a great deal of wealth. (Genesis 15,14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators insist that the expression: וישאלו refers to asking for an outright gift. (Rabbeinu Chananel)&nbsp;They claim that Psalms 2,8: 'שאל ממני ואתנה וגו, “ask&nbsp;something of Me and I will grant it,” is proof of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מאת רעהו</span><span class="font5">, “from his friend or comrade;” to the question of: “since when were the ordinary Egyptians the personal&nbsp;friends of the Israelites?” The answer is that after the plagues&nbsp;had ceased, the Egyptians’ attitude towards the Israelites&nbsp;underwent a drastic change, and they became very willing to&nbsp;let them use their vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כלי כסף וכלי זהב</span><span class="font5">, “silver vessels and golden vessels.” It was no more than a fair exchange, seeing that the Israelites&nbsp;left behind their houses and their fields which no one&nbsp;compensated them for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We read already in Genesis 47,27 ויאחזו בה, that the sons of Yaakov instead of or in addition to being shepherds,&nbsp;also became land owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גם האיש משה גדול מאד</span><span class="font5">, “also the person called&nbsp;Moses was a very greatly esteemed man.” The Torah writes&nbsp;this in order for us to understand the reason why the Torah&nbsp;reports that the Israelites “emptied out” Egypt. Many&nbsp;Egyptians gave gifts to the Israelites as a sign of their high&nbsp;esteem for their leader Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובעיני העם, </span><span class="font5">“as well as in the eyes of the people.” (the Egyptian people, not only in the eyes of Pharaoh’s officials.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר משה</span><span class="font5">, Moses said: according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> this&nbsp;paragraph was told to him while he was still standing in the&nbsp;palace in the presence of Pharaoh as he never saw him&nbsp;again later. The words: נאמרה לו, “were said (revealed) to&nbsp;him,” refer to Moses relating his latest prophecy to Pharaoh.&nbsp;The proof of this is that if these words were only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">now&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">communicated to Moses by G’d, why did </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> not comment&nbsp;this on verse 1 of our chapter? We must therefore&nbsp;understand Moses as having announced the plague of his&nbsp;own volition without a commandment at </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font5"> time, as he had&nbsp;already done so with the plague of the locusts, as stated in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessikta</span><span class="font5"> on the verse 29 in chapter 12. This is also the way it&nbsp;is described in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma</span><span class="font5"> 12,37 (older version) concerning&nbsp;that paragraph commencing with: “it was at about midnight;”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כחצות הלילה</span><span class="font5">, “approximately at midnight;” actually when&nbsp;midnight struck; here the prefix כ is used in the prediction&nbsp;whereas at the actual hour of the dying of the firstborn, the&nbsp;Torah describes it as having occurred precisely at midnight.&nbsp;We find something similar in Exodus 13,4 where Moses tells&nbsp;the people: היום אתם יוצאים בחודש האביב, “you are leaving this&nbsp;day in the month of spring.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אני יוצא</span><span class="font5">, “I am going out (taking a walk);” seeing that Pharaoh had failed to heed Moses’ warning, I will personally&nbsp;descend from heaven to carry out what Moses had&nbsp;threatened would happen at this hour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,5. כל בכור</span><span class="font5">, “every firstborn.” Both the firstborn of a&nbsp;mother and the firstborn of a father were included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הבכור פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “from the firstborn of Pharaoh,” i.e. a firstborn of the father, to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד בכור השפחה, </span><span class="font5">“including the firstborn of a servant maid,” i.e. the firstborn of a mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד בכור השפחה</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> seeing that most commentators here understand the words בכור השפחה, to be&nbsp;identical to בכור השבי in 12,29, they use that term in their&nbsp;commentary on this verse. They assume that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> agreed&nbsp;seeing that nearly all prisoners of war become slaves.&nbsp;[According to my understanding of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on 2,29, there are&nbsp;degrees in the hierarchy of slaves. The Torah uses both&nbsp;terms, as the slave who was a prisoner of war is considered&nbsp;as at the rock-bottom of that hierarchy. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another reason for the two terms being used by the Torah for servant women; when the firstborn sons of servant&nbsp;maids heard Moses use the term ש</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פחה </span><span class="font5">in our verse, they&nbsp;decided to become captives so as to escape the threat of&nbsp;being killed. Upon noticing this, G’d said: while it is true that I&nbsp;had only spoken about the firstborn of the servant maid being&nbsp;killed, now I must include also the firstborn of a woman&nbsp;prisoner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the expression בכור השבי is subordinate to the general heading of בכור השפחה. The&nbsp;prophets in their way of expressing themselves (as opposed&nbsp;to the Torah itself) do not bother with stylistic effects but are&nbsp;concerned with the basics. Such nuances as השקני “let me&nbsp;drink,” as opposed to הגמאיני, “let me sip,” when Eliezer is&nbsp;quoted as speaking to Rivkah, (Genesis 24,38) or the two&nbsp;versions of the commandment to keep the Sabbath in the&nbsp;Ten Commandments no less, i.e. in Yitro it says: כיב! for&nbsp;“remember,” whereas in the Book of Deuteronomy, the text&nbsp;of which is attributed to Moses, it says: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">שמור</span><span class="font5"> to express the&nbsp;same commandment, or minor differences such as swearing&nbsp;a false oath which in Yitro is described as לשוא, and in&nbsp;Leviticus 19,12, לשקר, or differences such as לא תחמוד, for “do&nbsp;not covet,” and לא תתאוה, in the version of the Ten&nbsp;Commandments in Deuteronomy 5,18, are to be viewed as if&nbsp;two sides of the same coin. [My words, Ed.] Both&nbsp;expressions convey the same basic thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another explanation: when Moses said: ומת כל בכור, “and </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font5"> firstborn will die,” the firstborn of the maidservants&nbsp;rejoiced noting that they are not considered in the eyes of the&nbsp;Jewish G’d from the firstborn of the nobility. When their&nbsp;masters noted their joy, they threw them in a dungeon to&nbsp;teach them a lesson and not to forget their place in the&nbsp;Egyptian hierarchy. As a result they died, while still in the&nbsp;dungeon. In effect what happened is simply that the first born&nbsp;who had been only slaves at the time the plague had been&nbsp;announced had become also prisoners by the time the&nbsp;plague became effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר אחרי הרחים</span><span class="font5">, “who walks behind the millstones to help grind. When the plague was over the Torah describes&nbsp;these people as having been in a dungeon. This is another&nbsp;example of what we discussed earlier on this page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators believe that these two verses are actually to be understood as a single verse, i.e. that these&nbsp;lowly slaves performed one kind of task by day and another&nbsp;by night. We find an example of this in the Book of Judges&nbsp;when Shimshon had to perform the task of pushing the&nbsp;millstone by day, whereas at night he was put back into the&nbsp;dungeon and the millstone was placed on to prevent him&nbsp;from escaping. (Judges 16,21.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל בכור בהמה </span><span class="font5">“and every firstborn of the domestic animals.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> G’d first punishes a people’s&nbsp;deities and then the people themselves. We see this from&nbsp;Exodus 7,17, where the river Nile, a major deity of the&nbsp;Egyptians was struck before the people suffered as a result&nbsp;of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר כמוהו לא נהיתה</span><span class="font5">, “the like of which had never&nbsp;occurred and will never occur again.” [The following is a&nbsp;comment on the grammatical incongruity in this verse where&nbsp;masculine and feminine constructions have been used&nbsp;inconsistently. Ed.] We find this kind of incongruity not only&nbsp;here but also in Leviticus 6,9: והרים ממנו </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">בקומצו</span><span class="font5">, as well as in&nbsp;Leviticus 27,9. Compare also Genesis 32,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation: the word כמוהו, does not refer to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">outcry</span><span class="font5"> of the Egyptians but to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">night</span><span class="font5">, לילה, which is&nbsp;masculine also. In chapter 11 verse 4, G’d had said that He&nbsp;would go out during that night. In our verse here the&nbsp;reference is to that night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא יחרץ כלב לשונו</span><span class="font5">, “not a single dog will whet its&nbsp;tongue;” it was customary for the dogs to bellow at midnight&nbsp;as midnight was the time when the watches changed as we&nbsp;know from the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot</span><span class="font5"> folio 3. When the Israelites&nbsp;made ready to leave, each one with his walking stick in his&nbsp;hand, these watchdogs did not raise their voices in protest&nbsp;and gave no alarm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,9. לא ישמע אליכ</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “Pharaoh will pay no heed to you.” You might argue that this contradicts what we read in&nbsp;verses 30-31, where Pharaoh and his servants are described&nbsp;as rising in the middle of the night, showing that he certainly&nbsp;did not ignore Moses’ warning. We therefore have to&nbsp;understand our verse here as referring to the entire period&nbsp;during which Moses was “negotiating” the release of the&nbsp;Jewish people. G’d had told Moses already at the burning&nbsp;bush that Pharaoh would not pay heed to his demands or&nbsp;threats. (Exodus 3,19) He had told him at that time that the&nbsp;reason for the lengthy negotiations was to demonstrate to&nbsp;him and his people G’d’s power by orchestrating the plagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another exegesis of the line: לא ישמע אליכם פרעה. Since I knew in advance that Pharaoh would not heed your warnings&nbsp;I should have smitten him and his people with the last plague&nbsp;at once in order to make good on what you told him that you&nbsp;were afraid that any delay would result .in the Israelites being&nbsp;punished by Me. The reason why instead of you being&nbsp;punished with the sword and pestilence, as you had warned&nbsp;him, is that now I am entitled to punish </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> with what he had&nbsp;not minded that you would be punished. His obstinacy&nbsp;enabled me to demonstrate My power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,10. את כל המופתים האלה, </span><span class="font5">“all these miracles</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span><span class="font5">' This refers to the nine plagues that had preceded the killing of the&nbsp;firstborn. G’d’s performing the 10<sup>th</sup> plague, however, would&nbsp;result in Pharaoh finally heeding all the warnings he had&nbsp;ignored previously. After the dying of the firstborn he will&nbsp;discharge the whole people and their portable belongings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,1. ויאמר ה' אל משה ואהרו</span><span class="font5">, this paragraph had been revealed to Moses prior to the instructions about the plague&nbsp;of the killing of the firstborn, as it must have been revealed&nbsp;before the tenth of the month, seeing that it contains&nbsp;instructions applicable from the 10<sup>th</sup> of the month onwards.&nbsp;The killing of the firstborn occurred during the night from the&nbsp;fourteenth to the fifteenth of that month. Seeing that we have&nbsp;a principle that the Torah is not bound to be written in&nbsp;chronological order of events described, this does not&nbsp;present a problem. Whenever the author of the Torah did not&nbsp;want to interrupt a certain subject under discussion, one way&nbsp;of achieving this was to ignore chronology. Another reason&nbsp;for this here is that the laws applicable to the month of&nbsp;Nissan should appear consecutively without interruption or&nbsp;digression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בארץ מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “in the land of Egypt.” Seeing that this chapter contains a number of commandments, it was&nbsp;necessary to write where these commandments were issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whenever no mention is made of where a commandment was issued, we can assume that it was first&nbsp;issued at Mount Sinai. [Though not necessarily&nbsp;communicated to the people at the time it was issued. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאמר</span><span class="font5">, “go and tell them immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,2. החדש</span><span class="font5">, “the month;” every first day of the month is&nbsp;referred to as חדש in the Torah (Bible?) whereas the entire&nbsp;month is called ירח, “moon.” The reason that the first day of&nbsp;the month is called חדש, “new,” is because it represents the&nbsp;renewal of the moon’s orbit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הזה</span><span class="font5">, this refers to the month known as ניסן in the Hebrew calendar. [How do we know this without having it&nbsp;spelled out for us? Ed.] The Torah describes the month in&nbsp;which the festival of huts falls, when the harvest has been&nbsp;brought in, as occurring at the time of the equinox. Exodus&nbsp;34,22). It describes the festival of weeks as occurring during&nbsp;the early harvesting season for wheat, (same verse) and it&nbsp;describes the time when the Passover festival </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(matzot)&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">occurs as being during the spring season, or more precisely&nbsp;as the month of the spring equinox. (Exodus 34,18) From all&nbsp;this it is clear that in order to comply with all these data the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font5"> festival can only occur during the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">and the Passover festival can only occur during the month of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan.</span><span class="font5"> It is spelled out even more clearly in the Book of&nbsp;Esther 3,7, “on the first month which is the month of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Nissan</span><span class="font5">.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הזה</span><span class="font5">. Why did G’d have to use the word “this”? Moses faced the problem that the new moon does not become&nbsp;visible to us until about 18 hours into the fourth day of the&nbsp;month, and it is difficult to pinpoint that moment exactly. This&nbsp;problem has already been pointed out by the liturgist who&nbsp;added extra poetical text to the prayers recited on the&nbsp;Shabbat preceding the beginning of the month of Nissan in a&nbsp;poem commencing with the words: אבי כל חוזה. The poet there&nbsp;calls the period during which the new moon is not yet&nbsp;observable שלשים מרוצות, (apparently a name for standard&nbsp;length of races)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation: Moses knew </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">when</span><span class="font5"> the new moon </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">commenced</span><span class="font5">, (in the sky) but did not know from what&nbsp;point on it could be welcomed with the customary prayer.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Kiddush levanah</span><span class="font5">) He did not know whether the correct time&nbsp;was when it started diminishing to the north or when it started&nbsp;diminishing towards the south. [The reader who is interested&nbsp;in the astronomical aspects of all this is referred to Rabbi&nbsp;Menachem Kasher’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah Shleymah,</span><span class="font5"> Genesis chapter 15&nbsp;item 48 where G’d was described as instructing Avraham in&nbsp;some of these details. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכם</span><span class="font5">, “for you.” This lunar calendar is not intended for the gentiles. They are to continue to use the solar calendar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראש חדשים</span><span class="font5">, the beginning of a count of months but not the beginning of the counting of years. The 7 annual&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">cycle, the 49 year Jubilee year cycle, the period of&nbsp;planting i.e. the seasons and harvesting, are all not regulated&nbsp;by the lunar calendar but by the solar calendar, i.e. relying on&nbsp;summer, winter, fall and spring. This has been spelled out in&nbsp;the Torah in Deut. 31,10: “at the conclusion of seven years,&nbsp;during the season of when the year of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">'release’&nbsp;begins during the festival of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sukkot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the first day in the month of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">had been intended to serve as the first day of the year, why did the Torah not&nbsp;command us to read the relevant passage on the holiday of&nbsp;Passover? This would have taught us that the month of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">was also the first month of the year! If the Torah&nbsp;describes the festival of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">as occurring at the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">end </span><span class="font5">of the&nbsp;year, the festival of Passover which occurs before any&nbsp;harvest season, cannot possibly be at the beginning of the&nbsp;year. Clearly, the beginning of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">year</span><span class="font5"> occurs near the&nbsp;festival of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראש חדשים</span><span class="font5">, the first of the months. Seeing that this leaves open how many months there should be, the Torah&nbsp;adds: לחדשי השנה, “for the months making a up a year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראשון הוא לכם</span><span class="font5">, if not for this line I might have thought that when we have a leap year we should add an additional&nbsp;month of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">instead of an additional month of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adar</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font5"> This&nbsp;would not work as the month of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">would also be the&nbsp;second month during that year. The Torah said specifically&nbsp;that the month of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">is to be (only) the first in a list of&nbsp;months. It did not distinguish between a year that has 13&nbsp;months and a year that has twelve months. The Torah&nbsp;nowhere warned us against having a year of thirteen months&nbsp;(or more). The Torah decreed to offer the Passover during&nbsp;that month and called it “the first month.” It also decreed that&nbsp;at least part of the festival must occur during the season&nbsp;known as “spring,” i.e. after the spring equinox. It also&nbsp;decreed that the festival of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">50 days after the&nbsp;beginning of Passover must occur during a season when&nbsp;wheat is already being harvested. (a period when the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bikkurim,</span><span class="font5"> the first ripe fruit of the seven species for which the&nbsp;land of Israel is famous, may already be ready to be offered&nbsp;in the Temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראשון הוא לכם</span><span class="font5">, “it is a first for you;” from now on this will be a first month for you, the reason being that you will start&nbsp;counting by months as a reminder of when you received your&nbsp;freedom from slavery. It will forever remind you of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Good&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">that I have done for you. Up until now, the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">had been the first month and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5"> the seventh. This&nbsp;agrees with what is written in Kings I, 8,2: בירח האיתנים בחג, “in&nbsp;the month of the original ones “ (the patriarchs, or in the&nbsp;months whom the early generations of mankind referred to)&nbsp;as the seventh month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yonatan ben Uzziel translates the word איתנים as “the ancient generations of man called it the first month and now&nbsp;it is the seventh month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לחדשי השנה, </span><span class="font5">“of the moons of the year.” These months commence with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan,</span><span class="font5"> followed by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lyar, Sivan,</span><span class="font5"> etc. This is&nbsp;the reason why they are not listed by name but number&nbsp;except in the Book of Chagay, Zecharyah, Daniel, Ezra and&nbsp;Nechemyah, (when the people were already in exile) Prior to&nbsp;this when a name is mentioned, it is not these names of&nbsp;Persian origin but name such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ziv, Eytanim, and Bul</span><span class="font5"> fall in&nbsp;the Book of Kings).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,3. בעשור לחודש הזה, ויקחו להם</span><span class="font5">, “on the tenth of this month, when they shall take or purchase for themselves etc.”&nbsp;The tenth of the month during that year was on a Sabbath.&nbsp;As a reminder of the fact that on that Sabbath the people&nbsp;collectively performed such a great commandment, it has&nbsp;since been named שבת הגדול, “the great Sabbath.” [Compare&nbsp;an article on this subject in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">miluim</span><span class="font5"> to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> by&nbsp;Rabbi Menachem Kasher of blessed memory Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקחו להם איש שה</span><span class="font5">, “they shall take for themselves, each, a lamb;” the significance of the animal “lamb” is that this was&nbsp;the zodiac sign of the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan.</span><span class="font5"> It was the sign that&nbsp;served as deity of good fortune to the Egyptians and would&nbsp;now forever become the reminder of good fortune to the&nbsp;people of Israel. By adopting this symbol and slaughtering a&nbsp;lamb as a sacrifice instead of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">worshipping</span><span class="font5"> it, the Jews&nbsp;demonstrated their faith in their G’d. They thereby&nbsp;neutralised any good fortune this constellation had ever had&nbsp;portended for the Egyptians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שה לבית אבות</span><span class="font5">, “one lamb for each family.” Even if in the same house the people who live there, as long as they are all&nbsp;living in that house, are to share that lamb, even if not of the&nbsp;same family; (unless they need </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">more</span><span class="font5"> than one lamb in which&nbsp;case they will have to take two or more.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שה לבית, </span><span class="font5">“one lamb per house.” The reason why each house needs to have at </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">least</span><span class="font5"> one lamb was to prove that in&nbsp;each house the people eating the lamb have first proved to&nbsp;have fulfilled G’d’s commandment to kill an Egyptian deity&nbsp;and consume it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תכוסו על השה</span><span class="font5">, “you shall be numbered;” (contribute&nbsp;financially to the purchase of the lamb.) The commandment&nbsp;is repeated to teach that the sacrificial animal is ritually&nbsp;disqualified if it was not slaughtered specifically for the&nbsp;people in that house who had become partners or been&nbsp;invited for eating of it. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pessachim 78)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שה תמים</span><span class="font5">, “a lamb without blemish;” a Jew could&nbsp;not take an animal that was not in perfect physical condition&nbsp;and be considered as having fulfilled his duty. He might have&nbsp;been tempted to do so in order to escape the wrath of the&nbsp;Egyptian from whom he had purchased it by saying that he&nbsp;had not taken an Egyptian deity, since surely the Egyptians&nbsp;do not worship blemished animals, nor female animals or&nbsp;overage, weak animals, so that he had not committed&nbsp;blasphemy in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">their</span><span class="font5"> eyes. The Torah spells all this out by&nbsp;writing: “unblemished, male, less than a year old.” The&nbsp;Egyptians would raise the price of these animals when aware&nbsp;that the Israelites would use it in the service of their G’d. The&nbsp;Torah wanted the Jews to pay the price of such animals,&nbsp;although at </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font5"> stage, they could have simply taken the&nbsp;animal without paying for it, as they no longer were afraid of&nbsp;their former masters. These had realised that they were not&nbsp;able to save their animals from the Israelites as long as these&nbsp;were still in their city. If they could not save their animals&nbsp;from the Israelites while in their own cities, how much less&nbsp;would they be able to do so outside their own domains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בן שנה</span><span class="font5">, “within the first year of its life.” We have proof that this is the meaning of the expression: בן שנה, from when&nbsp;the princes offered their offerings during the consecration&nbsp;rites of the Tabernacle in Numbers 7,15 and elsewhere, as&nbsp;the Torah there describes each of these lambs as בן שנתו,&nbsp;“during the first year of its life.” At the end the Torah repeats&nbsp;that they offered 12 lambs each “in the first year of its life,”&nbsp;i.e. בני שנה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,6. והיה לכם למשמרת</span><span class="font5">, “this lamb shall be carefully watched over by you (for possible blemishes). According to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> G’d commanded the Israelites two commandments&nbsp;prior to their qualifying for redemption. They had to slaughter&nbsp;(release blood and put it on their door posts, and they had to&nbsp;give up some blood of their own bodies by circumcising&nbsp;themselves). This is referred to in Ezekiel 16,6 when the&nbsp;prophet refers to their having remained alive due to these&nbsp;categories of blood. Yonatan ben Uzziel translates that line in&nbsp;Ezekiel as: “by means of the blood of circumcision and the&nbsp;blood of the Passover sacrifice I will redeem you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה לכם למשמרת עד ארבעה עשר יום</span><span class="font5">, “you are to keep it under close observation until the fourteenth day.” According&nbsp;to the view that examining for a blemish in the eye requires&nbsp;thirty days, that scholar may refer only to temporary&nbsp;blemishes which are apt to heal; here the examination is to&nbsp;determine if there is a visible blemish of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: if the animal was purchased from a gentile the examination period is thirty days. Here&nbsp;where the Israelites already had animals in reserve in&nbsp;anticipation of going into the desert to offer sacrifices, at least&nbsp;cursory examinations had already been made prior to the&nbsp;commandment. Therefore an additional four days was&nbsp;adequate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד ארבעה עשר יום</span><span class="font5">, “in order to annoy the Egyptians who had to sit by unable to interfere while the Israelites prepared&nbsp;to kill their deities.” These animals were kept tied up where&nbsp;everyone could see them for four days. They would hear the&nbsp;animals bleat and were powerless to do anything about it. If&nbsp;we needed proof for this assumption it is found in the words:&nbsp;לחודש הזה “(only) during this month.” This means that this&nbsp;commandment was a commandment to be performed only&nbsp;once in Jewish history, [as we are a people that shuns&nbsp;cruelty to animals, so much so that we are commanded to&nbsp;unload the donkeys of even an enemy, if we see that it broke&nbsp;down under too heavy load. (Exodus 23,5) Ed.] What follows&nbsp;the words: לחודש הזה, “for this month,” are rules applicable&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> to the Passover prior to the Exodus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושחטו אותו</span><span class="font5">, “they are to slaughter it.” It was to be slaughtered regardless of whether the fourteenth of the&nbsp;month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5"> was a weekday or a Sabbath. [I fail to see&nbsp;the relevance in this verse of that rule, seeing that we speak&nbsp;only about the Passover offered in Egypt, not about&nbsp;subsequent Passovers. Discussion of future observances of&nbsp;the Passover does not start until verse 14. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The author raises the rhetorical question of how to make the words: “he who desecrates it (the Sabbath) shall&nbsp;be executed” (Exodus 31,14), as applying to additional ritual&nbsp;activities other than the actual slaughtering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The instruction of ושחטו אותו, which sounds as if the whole congregation was commanded to participate in the&nbsp;slaughtering, an obvious impossibility, was inserted only&nbsp;because Moses had told Pharaoh that if the Israelites were to&nbsp;offer sacrifices to their G’d inside Egypt the Egyptians would&nbsp;surely kill the people trying to do so. (8,2) In the event, they&nbsp;did slaughter the animals inside Egypt and were not stoned&nbsp;to death by the Egyptians. G’d had to give this specific&nbsp;instruction so that the Israelites would not be afraid to do so,&nbsp;quoting Moses’ own words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושחטו אותו</span><span class="font5">, contrary to other “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">almost</span><span class="font5"> communal” offerings, this offering did not need to be accompanied by&nbsp;libations, and the owners did not have to perform the rite of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s’michah,</span><span class="font5"> placing their weight with all their strength on the&nbsp;animal prior to its being slaughtered; neither did the&nbsp;slaughterer have to perform the heaving of the animal prior to&nbsp;its being slaughtered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושחטו אותו כל קהל עדת ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “the entire congregation of the Jewish people shall slaughter it.” This commandment&nbsp;cannot be delegated to a fellow Jew to be performed on his&nbsp;behalf. They must all be partners (financially) in performing&nbsp;this commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בין הערבים</span><span class="font5">, “in the hours after the labourers have completed their daily chores.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולקחו מן הדם ונתנו</span><span class="font5">, “they are to take some of its&nbsp;blood and put it, etc;” not with the fingers but by means of&nbsp;some hyssop branches and leaves that have been dipped&nbsp;into it. Moses has elaborated on this procedure in verse 22.&nbsp;Whatever details have been omitted in this paragraph were&nbsp;added in the second paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על שתי המזוזות, </span><span class="font5">“on the two upright posts,” on either side of the entrance;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על המשקוף</span><span class="font5">, “on the lintel;” the word משקוף is a derivative of וישקף “he looked down.” The lintel faces the empty space&nbsp;of the door and “looks” down into it. The reason for this was&nbsp;seeing that not all the Egyptians had become aware of what&nbsp;was going on, now that they saw these markings at the&nbsp;entrances to the homes of the Israelites they would realise&nbsp;how the Israelites had desecrated their sacred symbols.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the blood on the entrances of the homes of the Israelites should form the equivalent of the&nbsp;letter ח, in order to protect the entrance so that the&nbsp;destructive force which would kill the firstborn inside would&nbsp;not carry out that command. The letter ח is reminiscent of&nbsp;Yitzchok blessing Esau with the words על </span><span class="font6">ח</span><span class="font5">רבך תחיה, “you will&nbsp;live by your sword.” (Genesis 27,40). On the other hand, the&nbsp;letter ח could be a symbol of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">חיים</span><span class="font5">, life. [It hardly pays to&nbsp;speculate. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על הבתים, </span><span class="font5">not “above” the houses but בבתים “attached to the houses.” The word על appears in that sense in על צבאותם,&nbsp;“with their respective armies,” or as in Genesis 27,40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואכלו את הבשר בלילה</span><span class="font5">, “they are to eat the meat&nbsp;during this night;” at the time when most people are at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בלילה הזה</span><span class="font5">, “during this night.” (On the night between the 14-15<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">צלי אש, </span><span class="font5">“roasted on the fire;” so that the fragrance of the meat will assail the noses of the Egyptians and they will&nbsp;reflect on what is happening to their deity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על מרורים</span><span class="font5">, “together with bitter herbs.” This was to drive home the memory of the many years their lives had been&nbsp;embittered by the Egyptians. This is why they were not to eat&nbsp;it with something sweet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל תאכלו ממנו נא</span><span class="font5">, “do not eat from it while it is still&nbsp;raw,” if an Egyptian comes along do not remove it from the&nbsp;fire by saying that it is already well done while in effect it is&nbsp;still rare; you might be induced to say something like that out&nbsp;of fear; therefore I command you not to be afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובשל מבושל</span><span class="font5">, “nor eat it boiled in water;” according to the plain meaning of the text the prefix ו in the word: ובשל is&nbsp;superfluous; the line means: “please do not eat it boiled in&nbsp;water to hide what it really is.” I want you to roast it on the fire&nbsp;in order that it achieve maximum visibility and smell; the word&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נא </span><span class="font5">introduces a request as opposed to a command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראשו על כרעיו ועל קרבו</span><span class="font5">, “its head, legs, and entrails over the fire.” Here too the word על means “with.” Even at the time&nbsp;it is being roasted it should be whole, not cut up. This too is&nbsp;to ensure maximum visibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תותירו ממנו</span><span class="font5">, “do not leave any leftovers from&nbsp;it;” if you were to do so, no one would know when it had been&nbsp;consumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באש תשרופו, </span><span class="font5">“you must burn in the fire by morning (in the event you were forced to leave something over). The point in&nbsp;all this is to demonstrate your disdain of the lamb as a deity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וככה תאכלו אותו</span><span class="font5">, “and this is the manner in which&nbsp;you are be dressed when eating it;” you will not sit at a table&nbsp;all ready to enjoy a feast, but will act in haste. Other sacred&nbsp;portions of the sacrifice must always be consumed by&nbsp;treating the meal as a gift from G’d with great respect and&nbsp;with evident enjoyment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בחפזון</span><span class="font5">, “in haste,” as applying to the manner in which the whole meal,&nbsp;including the leavened bread and the bitter herbs is to be&nbsp;consumed. It is to be wolfed down indicating that the person&nbsp;consuming this meal is in a great hurry. The reason that the&nbsp;bitter herbs are to be eaten as an integral part of the course&nbsp;is to enable the consumer to eat it faster. The three&nbsp;constituent items to be consumed symbolize: slavery&nbsp;redemption, and freedom. The bitter herbs symbolize the&nbsp;slavery; the unleavened bread symbolizes freedom and the&nbsp;meat of the Passover symbolizes the act of redemption,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">being saved. At the time when the Passover lamb was being consumed the firstborn Egyptians were being killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל תאכלו ממנו נא </span><span class="font5">“do not eat any part of it while not thoroughly roasted;” by eating meat that has not been&nbsp;thoroughly roasted or boiled, a person is liable to disgorge it&nbsp;involuntarily, resulting in some of it remaining uneaten until&nbsp;morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובשל מבושל במים</span><span class="font5">, “nor thoroughly boiled in water;” boiling meat takes longer than roasting it; on that night speed was of&nbsp;the essence. The expression: ויבשלו את הפסח, in Chronicles II</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">35,13, does not refer to “boiling;” this is why the word: במים is&nbsp;not mentioned there. It merely means that the meat of the&nbsp;Passover had been thoroughly roasted and made fit to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אם צלי אש, </span><span class="font5">“but only roasted on the fire;” the reason that roasting meat is faster than boiling it, is that there is no&nbsp;other element separating it from the fire, such as water or&nbsp;another liquid. It must not be boiled in water or any other&nbsp;liquid even </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> having been roasted on fire; this is the&nbsp;reason why the expression כי אם צלי אש, has been repeated.&nbsp;(in verse 9) It must not be boiled in a pot (its own juices)&nbsp;even if no other liquid has been added. All of these details&nbsp;have been spelled out in the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 41. The manner in which the Torah writes these&nbsp;prohibitions is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">analogous to the manner in which the type&nbsp;of woman a High priest must not marry is described in&nbsp;Leviticus 21,12, as here </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">only </span><span class="font5">negative commandments are&nbsp;listed, whereas there the negative commandment is linked to&nbsp;the positive commandment of the High priest marrying a&nbsp;virgin. [I am abbreviating here a little, as I feel the author&nbsp;digressed a little, his remarks being addressed only to Torah&nbsp;students of an advanced level. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this point the Torah does not again repeat the words: ”do not eat.” The Torah’s point here is to forbid dividing&nbsp;preparation of the meat of the Passover meal into two or&nbsp;more courses, as this would negate the condition that it be&nbsp;eaten in haste. It does not mean that the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">entire</span><span class="font5"> entrails must&nbsp;be consumed They must only be roasted together with the&nbsp;rest of the meat in order to ensure that there would not be&nbsp;edible parts of the animal left by morning. It is not the custom&nbsp;of people who plan to undertake a journey on the following&nbsp;morning, as did the Israelites, to plan to leave over part of it&nbsp;to be consumed on the next day. This is why the Torah&nbsp;demands that in the event of there being such leftovers at the&nbsp;morning, they have to be burned to ash immediately. If that&nbsp;were not done, these leftovers of a sacred meal would be&nbsp;consumed by dogs, a most unfitting treatment for meat of a&nbsp;sacrifice. Alternately, the leftovers would be thrown into the&nbsp;garbage, an equally demeaning treatment of sacrificial meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the Torah writing the words: עד בקר, “until morning” twice, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> writes that this means (concerning&nbsp;Passover meat for subsequent years) that seeing that&nbsp;morning would be part of a festival day on which burning&nbsp;other than for the purpose of eating the result is forbidden,&nbsp;the leftover must not be burned until the morning thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no reason to raise an objection by saying “why did the sages of the Torah not apply the principle of the&nbsp;positive commandment to burn the leftover to override the&nbsp;negative commandment not to light a fire, so that the&nbsp;leftovers could be burned without delay? Answer: we know&nbsp;that the observance of the festival is itself also rated as a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">negative</span><span class="font5"> commandment in Leviticus 23,39 ,ביום הראשון שבתון,&nbsp;“the first day of the festival is a day that includes work&nbsp;prohibition” (similar to that of the Sabbath)? We have a rule&nbsp;that a positive commandment </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">cannot</span><span class="font5"> override a negative&nbsp;commandment when that negative commandment is&nbsp;accompanied by a positive commandment in addition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומקלכם בידכם</span><span class="font5">, “with your walking staffs held in your hands.” These staffs were used to urge on the donkeys as&nbsp;we find in Numbers 22,27: ויך את האתון, “Bileam struck the&nbsp;she-ass.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואכלתם אותו בחפזון</span><span class="font5">, “you are to eat it in haste.” You were slated to leave Egypt in a hurry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'פסח הוא לה</span><span class="font5">, “it is a Passover offering for the Lord.” The reason that the offering is called “Passover,” is because G’d&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">passed over</span><span class="font5"> the houses of the Israelites marked with the&nbsp;blood of the lamb when killing the respective firstborn inside&nbsp;them. The fact that you had performed all the activities He&nbsp;had demanded of you, enabled the attribute of Justice to skip&nbsp;your homes. We encounter something similar in a prayer&nbsp;composed by Moses in Deuteronomy 26,15: השקיפה ממעון&nbsp;קדשך מן השמים, “look down (benignly) from Your holy&nbsp;residence, from heaven;” (recited by the farmer who&nbsp;announced that he had complied with all the tithes applicable&nbsp;to his harvest)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.12.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“and against all the deities worshipped in Egypt;”&nbsp;this is to be understood in the same way as when G’d said to&nbsp;Moses that He had appointed him as an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font5"> in relation to&nbsp;Pharaoh in 7,1, or as in Samuel II 7,23: אשר הלכו אלהים,&nbsp;“which G’d set out, etc.;” the word describes a terrestrial&nbsp;superpower as compared to a celestial superpower. [My&nbsp;words, Ed.] This power is higher than the Pharaoh of the&nbsp;land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אעשה שפטים</span><span class="font5">, “I will execute judgments.” These will be of a physical nature, causing pain. Compare Chronicles II</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">24,24, ואת יואש, “and upon Yoash they inflicted punishments.”&nbsp;In every house where there was a biological firstborn he was&nbsp;killed; in a house which did not have a biological firstborn, the&nbsp;most senior person was killed. In this verse the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">is not to be understood as a deity, as it is impossible to inflict&nbsp;physical pain on something which is not made of flesh and&nbsp;blood, and which is not alive. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here understands the&nbsp;words אלוהי מצרים as referring to idols made of wood or&nbsp;molten metal cast in a form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיה הדם לכם לאות, </span><span class="font5">“the blood (on your door&nbsp;frames) will serve as symbol on your behalf;” it will signal that&nbsp;you kept G’d’s commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: “the blood will serve as a reminder to G’d that the Egyptians have spilled your blood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וראיתי את הדם, </span><span class="font5">“as soon as I will see the blood, etc.” Even though the blood that the Egyptians had spilled was&nbsp;inside their bodies and as such not visible from the outside,&nbsp;everything is visible to G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following is in response to the question of how the angel could see this even though G’d could see it. The text&nbsp;sounds as if G’d is speaking about Himself. The fact is that&nbsp;once G’d has appointed an angel as His executor, that angel&nbsp;assumes the role of the One Who has appointed him, and&nbsp;when the Torah Speaks of: “when I see,” the reference is to&nbsp;the emissary whom G’d appointed. He is entitled to use that&nbsp;description as applicable to himself while on that mission.&nbsp;The author’s point about the role of the messenger, i.e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">angel, is proved when the Torah speaks of G’d not giving the destroyer permission to kill Jewish firstborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The part of the Exodus story which was orchestrated by G’d personally, without the help of any angels, was that of&nbsp;taking the Jewish people out of Egypt. This is emphasised in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">haggadah</span><span class="font5"> of Passover where the author writes, quoting&nbsp;Deuteronomy 26,8: ויוציאנו ה' ממצרים, “the Lord took us out of&nbsp;Egypt,” and the author of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">haggadah</span><span class="font5"> adds; לא על ידי מלאך&nbsp;“not by means of an angel;” לא על ידי שרף, “not through a&nbsp;higher ranking angel called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seraph;</span><span class="font5"> ולא על ידי שליח, “and not&nbsp;by means of any other agent at His disposal;. אלא הקדוש ברוך&nbsp;הוא בכבודו ובעצמו, “but only the Holy One blessed be He, in&nbsp;His glory, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">personally.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ופסחתי עליכם, “I will pass over you; “the word פסח is a variant of פסע; it appears again in the same sense as here in&nbsp;Kings I 18,26: ויפסחו על המזבח, where the prophet Elijah&nbsp;mocked the priests of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baal</span><span class="font5"> and they jumped over the&nbsp;altar again and again to no avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,14. לכם לזכרון</span><span class="font5">, “for you as a remembrance.” Prior to&nbsp;this verse the Torah dealt with Passover that the Israelites&nbsp;sacrificed and ate while in Egypt. From here on we have the&nbsp;legislation dealing with how to commemorate this event&nbsp;annually for all future generations. Whereas in Egypt, this&nbsp;ritual was a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">condition</span><span class="font5"> in order to bring about the redemption,&nbsp;from now on it would serve as a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">reminder</span><span class="font5"> of who it was who&nbsp;gave us freedom, not Pharaoh, neither did we gain freedom&nbsp;by our own efforts, but our freedom is due exclusively to the&nbsp;direct intervention of G’d </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">personally</span><span class="font5"> in our fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">לדורותיכם חקת עולם, “for your generations as an everlasting statute.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the last two words&nbsp;were added seeing that the word לדורותיכם, without a number,&nbsp;could be understood as the customary minimum plural mode,&nbsp;i.e. only two generations. You might counter that we have&nbsp;been taught in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba batra</span><span class="font5"> foliol20 that this is an&nbsp;instance the word לדורותיכם by itself is to be understood as an&nbsp;unlimited number of generations, so how could </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> have&nbsp;written what he did? We must therefore understand </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> as&nbsp;telling us that the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">word</span><span class="font5"> לדורותיכם even without the additional&nbsp;words חקת עולם, “an everlasting statute,” always means just&nbsp;that, as opposed to other nouns which appear in the plural&nbsp;mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,15. שבעת ימים מצות תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “you are to eat unleavened bread for seven days.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> tackles the problem that in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 16,8 the Torah writes that we are to eat&nbsp;unleavened bread for six days, whereas the seventh day is to&nbsp;be observed as the last day of the festival. This, according to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5">, appears to teach that on that day no more unleavened&nbsp;bread need be eaten, as long as no leavened bread is eaten.&nbsp;How do we know that even during the first six days the eating&nbsp;of unleavened bread is also voluntary? It is learned from a&nbsp;certain rule applied to exegesis of the written text of the&nbsp;Torah, known as: דבר שהיה בכלל ויצא מן הכלל ללמד, לא ללמד על&nbsp;עצמו יצא, “when something had first been included in a&nbsp;general proposition, and then appears to have provided for&nbsp;an exception to that proposition only in order to teach&nbsp;something additional, this new instruction does not only apply&nbsp;to the new situation cited as example, but applies to the&nbsp;proposition as a whole.” In other words, all the seven days on&nbsp;which unleavened bread was to be eaten is contained as a&nbsp;proposition in our verse. The verse cited from Deuteronomy&nbsp;now came to teach an additional dimension of the proposition&nbsp;first legislated in our verse here. Having heard that eating&nbsp;unleavened bread on the seventh day is not obligatory, it&nbsp;follows that neither is the commandment to eat unleavened&nbsp;bread for six days. It was written only because eating&nbsp;leavened bread is prohibited during all the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">seven</span><span class="font5"> days. In&nbsp;order not to mislead us into believing that even on the first&nbsp;night of the festival the eating of unleavened bread is also&nbsp;“only” voluntary, the Torah wrote a special verse&nbsp;commanding the eating of the meat of the Passover offering&nbsp;together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs on that&nbsp;evening. [It is easy for us nowadays to remember this, as we&nbsp;recite a special benediction when eating unleavened bread&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seder</span><span class="font5"> table on the first night. As far as the other&nbsp;meal times during the festival are concerned, if we wish to&nbsp;deny ourselves the pleasure of eating bread, we are free to&nbsp;do so. The line: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בערב תאכלו מצות, </span><span class="font5">spells out the duty to eat&nbsp;unleavened bread on that night. (Exodus 12,20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעת ימים מצות תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “you will eat </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzot</span><span class="font5"> for seven days.” These </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">seven</span><span class="font5"> days are symbolic of what our author&nbsp;terms the quarter month which was the duration of most of&nbsp;the plagues;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעת ימים מצות תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, this commandment is valid for all future generations and is an appendix to the words in verse&nbsp;14 preceding it that חוקת עולם תחגהו, “you are to celebrate it&nbsp;as a festival forever.” These words could not possibly have&nbsp;referred to the unleavened bread the Israelites had eaten in&nbsp;Egypt, for even though the amount they had baked&nbsp;apparently lasted them for 61 meals each (30 days) it was&nbsp;eaten as a fulfillment of a commandment only on the first&nbsp;night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אך ביום הראשון תשבותו</span><span class="font5">, “but on the first of these seven days you are to abstain from work (normal weekday&nbsp;activities)”. According to the plain meaning of the text, תשביתו&nbsp;plural mode of שבת, as in Genesis 2,2: ויכל אלוקים ביום השביעי,&nbsp;“on the seventh day G’d had completed, etc.” it is impossible&nbsp;to interpret that verse as G’d having been busy with creative&nbsp;activity. He clearly had completed that activity by the evening&nbsp;of the sixth day. On the seventh day He found that His work&nbsp;had come to an end. In our paragraph the Torah repeats the&nbsp;same approach. The words: you shall abstain from work on&nbsp;its first day, mean that you had completed your preparations&nbsp;for the festival before the evening of the 14<sup>th</sup> day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">As soon as that day dawned, you found yourself in a state of&nbsp;rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי כל אוכל חמץ</span><span class="font5">, “for anyone eating leavened matter, etc.” the Torah had to spell out the penalty for eating leavened&nbsp;matter during these seven days, as otherwise people would&nbsp;have thought that while they had to eat unleavened bread on&nbsp;the first night, and were expected to eat unleavened bread&nbsp;during the whole seven days, they could </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">also</span><span class="font5"> eat leavened&nbsp;matter if they so chose. If they were to be allowed to do so,&nbsp;the impact of subsisting on unleavened bred for seven days&nbsp;would be lost on them. Therefore the Torah added: ולא יאכל&nbsp;חמץ, “nothing leavened must be eaten.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,16. מקרא קדש, </span><span class="font5">“a holy convocation.” According to its translation into Aramaic, this expression means: מארע קדיש, “a&nbsp;festival.” On that day holy things occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כל מלאכה לא יעשה בהם, “no creative kind of work may be performed on these days. This formulation, according to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> includes that no gentile perform such work on behalf of or for the benefit of a Jew. If that were correct, the Torah&nbsp;would have legislated for the gentiles, and this would&nbsp;contradict the statement in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 150,&nbsp;that asking a gentile to perform work for you on the Sabbath&nbsp;is a Rabbinical and not Biblical prohibition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בהם</span><span class="font5">, “on them.” On the first and the seventh day of the festival, these types of work are forbidden to be performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אך אשר יאכל לכל נפש</span><span class="font5">, “However (work needed) for preparing the food for the person is permitted to be&nbsp;performed also on those two days. The reason why the&nbsp;Torah had to add this line is because it had written previously&nbsp;that כל מלאכה, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">every manner</span><span class="font5"> of work is prohibited on these&nbsp;two days, it had to spell out the exception to that rule. On&nbsp;another occasion (Leviticus 23,7) where the festivals are&nbsp;discussed, the work prohibition was mentioned already with&nbsp;the term מלאכת עבודה, the type of menial work performed on&nbsp;the week days, instead of the Torah writing: כל מלאכה “all&nbsp;manner of work.” The Torah wishes us to know that&nbsp;preparing food is not considered “menial work.” The only&nbsp;days on which even this kind of work is forbidden are the&nbsp;Sabbath and Yom Kippur, (which is also called Sabbath)&nbsp;[and had been forbidden in the desert </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">before </span><span class="font5">the Torah had&nbsp;been given as soon as the manna had fallen on the sixth&nbsp;day. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכל נפש</span><span class="font5">, “for every soul,” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> the word “for all,” includes preparing food for one’s domestic animals.&nbsp;When the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beytzah</span><span class="font5"> folio 20, interprets the word לכם&nbsp;for you (pl) to include your dogs, the reason is that the dogs&nbsp;are able to forage for themselves and it is not making&nbsp;animals suffer if they are not being fed, or if food is not&nbsp;prepared for them on that day. Seeing that this is so, we&nbsp;might have thought that the domestic animals that cannot&nbsp;forage for themselves and depend on their owners for their&nbsp;food we would be able to provide for on the festivals, the&nbsp;Torah therefore had to write לכם, “for yourselves,” (you&nbsp;prepare food on the festivals but not for the gentiles (as they&nbsp;are able to look after themselves). Both verses are&nbsp;necessary as I might have thought that while it is forbidden to&nbsp;prepare food for a gentile independently, it is permitted a to&nbsp;add extra amounts for gentiles to that which you are&nbsp;preparing for your own family, the Torah writes לכם, i.e. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">for your own family not for gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמרתם את המצות</span><span class="font5">, “you shall observe the&nbsp;commandment to eat unleavened bread on these days for&nbsp;the future.” We find this formulation being use in this sense&nbsp;also in Numbers 28,2 in connection with the daily communal&nbsp;offering where the Torah writes: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">תשמרו</span><span class="font5"> להקריב לי במועדו, ”make&nbsp;sure that you offer it at the time appointed for it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עד יום עשרים ואחד</span><span class="font5">, “until (incl.) the twenty first day&nbsp;(of the month).” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> asks why the Torah had to spell this&nbsp;out seeing we can count to seven? He answers that seeing&nbsp;the Torah had previously written the word: ימים, “days.” I&nbsp;might have thought that only the daylight hours are meant.&nbsp;By telling us until which date of the month this commandment&nbsp;is applicable, I know that it also applies during the nights.&nbsp;Where do we have another example of the same formulation&nbsp;being used to make that point? Answer: in verse 1 in our&nbsp;chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If we are to answer seeing that we are left with the question that what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> answered should already have&nbsp;been written on that verse, one might venture the thought&nbsp;that there are commandments for which a reward is&nbsp;promised if it is performed, and one is punished for the mere&nbsp;failure to perform the commandment. An example would be&nbsp;the failure to eat </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzah</span><span class="font5"> on the first night of Passover. On&nbsp;the other hand, no penalty is incurred if one does not eat any&nbsp;more </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzah</span><span class="font5"> on the remaining days of the festival. If one&nbsp;eats </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzah</span><span class="font5"> every day of the festival, although one could&nbsp;have avoided it without penalty, one still receives full credit&nbsp;for observing what the Torah had formulated as a&nbsp;commandment. This is so even if one ate the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzah</span><span class="font5"> only on&nbsp;the seven nights of the festival. However, if one ate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">during the last eight or nine days of the month of Nissan, one&nbsp;does not accumulate additional credit as the period for which&nbsp;one qualified had concluded on the twenty first day of&nbsp;Nissan. To make this abundantly clear, the Torah wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">בראשון בארבעה עשר יום לחודש בערב תאכלו מצות עד יום האחד ועשרים יום לחודש בערב, “On the first day, the fourteenth of the month&nbsp;in the evening until the twenty first day of the month in the&nbsp;evening you are to eat </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,19. שבעת ימים שאור לא ימצא בבתיכם</span><span class="font5">, “for seven days no leaven shall be found in your homes. This verse is meant to&nbsp;enlighten us about the proper meaning of the words in verse</span></p>
<p dir="rtl"><span class="font5">ביום הראשון תשביתו שאור מבתיכם :15</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If translated literally, it would mean: “on the first day you are to get rid and destroy all the leaven that you own from&nbsp;your houses.” However, it is clear that this must occur not on&nbsp;the first day of Passover but before, at least on the day&nbsp;before at noon, after which the blood of the sacrifice called&nbsp;Passover can be offered on the altar. The seven days&nbsp;following that day are equal in all respect concerning the&nbsp;laws governing leaven, in that no leaven must be capable of&nbsp;being found in a Jew’s house (if it is his). It had to be gotten&nbsp;rid off or destroyed already on the day prior to the 15<sup>th</sup> of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators therefore understand the plain meaning of the text as: “you do not need to have leaven on&nbsp;hand to facilitate the rising of your dough already when you&nbsp;prepare your dough which is to be eaten on the first night of&nbsp;the festival.” This </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">precaution</span><span class="font5"> is necessary, as the penalty for&nbsp;eating leavened products is so severe, i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">karet,</span><span class="font5"> being cut&nbsp;off from your people spiritually, permanently as stated in&nbsp;verse 19. The precaution therefore is to remove the leaven&nbsp;prior to, not only at or after the onset of the festival. You may&nbsp;not even eat a product which contains a mixture of leavened&nbsp;and unleavened dough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,20 בכל מושבותיכם תאכלו מצות</span><span class="font5">, “you are to eat</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">unleavened bread in all of your dwellings.” The reason why the Torah uses the expression: בכל מושבותיכם, “wherever you&nbsp;will be at home,” is because this commandment applies&nbsp;equally in the land of Israel and outside of it. This is distinct&nbsp;from eating of the Passover lamb, a law which can be fulfilled&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> in the land of Israel and at a time when offerings can be&nbsp;offered in the Temple or at least on the Temple Mount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,21. ויקרא משה לכל זקני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, Moses called upon all the elders of Israel;” previously the Torah had phrased this&nbsp;as: דברו אל כל עדת ישראל, “speak to the whole congregation of&nbsp;Israel” (verse 3) Why the difference? The commandment to&nbsp;own or partly own the lamb destined to become the Passover&nbsp;offering applied equally to every Israelite. The commandment&nbsp;to slaughter this animal applied only to the elders. Ordinary&nbsp;people, i.e. laymen, were not to perform the act of&nbsp;slaughtering for fear that they might disqualify the animal&nbsp;through an error on their part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">!</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">משכו</span><span class="font5">, “draw out!” The meaning is to include as many members of the family into participating in the eating of one&nbsp;lamb so that there would be no leftovers. We find the root&nbsp;משך used in this context in Judges 4,7, where Devorah tells&nbsp;Barak that she will arrange that as many warriors as possible&nbsp;will be pulled together to the river Kishon, so as to present a&nbsp;good target for his attack. [Barak was to swoop down from&nbsp;Mount Tabor. Siserah’s chariots would be useless in the&nbsp;river. Ed.] The Torah repeats the instruction to slaughter the&nbsp;lamb, because it had to tell us about the bunch of hyssop&nbsp;that was to be dipped in the blood and smeared on the&nbsp;doorposts of the houses and the lintels. Also it had to tell us&nbsp;because of the end of the verse where the people inside the&nbsp;houses are warned not even to step outside until morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והגעתם אל המשקוף ואל שתי המזוזות</span><span class="font5">, “and apply&nbsp;some to the lintel and to the two doorposts.” In verse 7 of this&nbsp;chapter the Torah had issued these instructions in the&nbsp;reverse order, i.e. to apply the blood to the two doorposts&nbsp;and the lintel.” The reason for this is to teach us that the&nbsp;order in which this ritual was performed did not matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא יתן המשחית</span><span class="font5">, “and He will not allow the&nbsp;Destroyer to, etc.; ”when our sages in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">haggadah</span><span class="font5"> said&nbsp;that the line: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ועברתי</span><span class="font5"> בארץ מצרים, means that G’d personally will&nbsp;carry out the killing of the firstborn, not any category of angel,&nbsp;(compare verse 12) they meant that He would not delegate&nbsp;an angel to perform this task but would perform it Himself,&nbsp;personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,26. </span><span class="font5">?</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מה העבודה הזאת לכם</span><span class="font5">, “what do you mean by this rite?” other rituals are governed by certain times of the year.&nbsp;The cutting of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer</span><span class="font5"> must take place on the 16<sup>th</sup> of the&nbsp;month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan;</span><span class="font5"> as this is the time when the barley harvest&nbsp;begins; the two loaves of wheat is to be offered on the 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;day after the first day of Passover; the four species of plants&nbsp;are to be used ritually on the 15<sup>th</sup> day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey.</span><span class="font5"> This ritual of&nbsp;applying the blood of the offering to the doorpost on the 14<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>day of Nissan is the exception as that day has no </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">other&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">significance. [I find this interpretation difficult, as the ritual&nbsp;described was not ever </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">again</span><span class="font5"> performed after the Israelites&nbsp;left Egypt. So why would future generations raise a question&nbsp;about a ritual that their fathers did </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font5"> perform? Ed.] “You are&nbsp;to say that it is part of the ritual of the Passover offering;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,27. בנגפו את מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “when He smote Egypt;” on the night of the 15<sup>th</sup> of Nissan;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת בתינו הציל</span><span class="font5">, “while at the same time saving our houses (from that plague). As a commemoration of this&nbsp;miracle we perform these rites.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: The question of the children in future generations does not apply to the rite of smearing&nbsp;blood on the doorposts but applies to the insistence that the&nbsp;meat of the Passover offering may be consumed only after&nbsp;having been roasted on the fire, and not when boiled in&nbsp;water, or half raw; the answer of the father is that this was a&nbsp;reminder of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">haste</span><span class="font5"> in which all this had to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקוד העם וישתחוו</span><span class="font5">, the people upon hearing this bowed low and prostrated themselves. This was a rite indicating that&nbsp;the party performing it accepted the instructions the Torah&nbsp;described in this chapter. It was an internationally accepted&nbsp;way of indicating acceptance of a command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,29. ויהי בחצי הלילה</span><span class="font5">, “it was precisely at midnight;” actually this paragraph should have been written immediately&nbsp;following chapter 11,verse 10, when the Torah reported that&nbsp;Pharaoh refused to let the Israelites go as demanded by G’d&nbsp;through His agents Moses and Aaron. If the Torah had done&nbsp;so, all the plagues would have been recorded in their proper&nbsp;sequence. The reason why the paragraph about the new&nbsp;moon was inserted in the middle of the list of the plagues&nbsp;was to alert the reader to how the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">firstborn</span><span class="font5"> Israelites escaped&nbsp;that plague when the Destroyer had targeted Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בחצי הלילה, וה׳ הכה כל בכור</span><span class="font5">, “at </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">midnight</span><span class="font5"> when the Lord smote every firstborn, etc.” elsewhere (Numbers 3,13) the&nbsp;wording used by the Torah about this plague was as follows:&nbsp;“on the day that I smote every firstborn;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Yochanan comments on this apparent discrepancy that although G’d smote the firstborn at&nbsp;midnight, the souls of those firstborn were still convulsing in&nbsp;their bodies until morning (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> item&nbsp;499 based on an ancient version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma)</span><span class="font5"> The reason&nbsp;for this was so that the Israelites would know with what&nbsp;plague G’d had killed the firstborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Eleazar ben Pedot, commenting on the same verse said: whenever a verse or phrase in the Torah&nbsp;commences with the word: 'וה, it refers to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">accompanied by His counselors. This teaches that prior to&nbsp;carrying out this punishment the heavenly Court (presided&nbsp;over by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> of course) debated the merits of it. The&nbsp;decree was issued by the entire Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מבכור פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “commencing with the firstborn son of Pharaoh,” (the highest ranking firstborn). The Torah hints&nbsp;that Pharaoh himself was also a firstborn. If he was killed in&nbsp;this manner it was in order for him to see how, through his&nbsp;obstinacy, a substantial part of the Egyptian males were&nbsp;killed in one single night. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mechilta Pisscha</span><span class="font5"> chapter 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">היושב על כסאו</span><span class="font5">, “who was meant to sit on Pharaoh’s throne in due course.” We find a similar formulation in Kings&nbsp;II 3,27: ויקח את בנו הבכור אשר ימלוך תחתיו, “he took his firstborn&nbsp;son, the one who was supposed to rule in his stead;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand our verse as the conclusion of a description how G’d employed the four most&nbsp;basic materials in the universe as having had a part in the&nbsp;plagues visited upon Egypt. These elements are; water,&nbsp;wind, fire and earth. The two first plagues involved the use by&nbsp;G’d of the water, i.e. blood in the Nile river basin and the&nbsp;frogs, which had their habitat in water. The next two plagues&nbsp;involving vermin and free roaming beasts were symbolic of&nbsp;the element earth, (dust). The wild beasts are described by&nbsp;the Torah during the six days of creation as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תוצא הארץ נפש&nbsp;חיה</span><span class="font5">, “let the earth produce </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">living</span><span class="font5"> creatures.” (Genesis 1,24)&nbsp;The two middle plagues, i.e. pestilence and infectious boils&nbsp;(#3 and #6) # 3 was produced through utilizing the air, (wind)&nbsp;i.e. pollution in the air, and #6. The boils were produced&nbsp;through Moses polluting the air with soot of a furnace. The&nbsp;hail and the locusts were initiated through stormy winds.&nbsp;Finally, the plague of killing the firstborn originated in heaven&nbsp;(where human life originated) (The upper waters?) The&nbsp;darkness likewise originated in heaven, where light, the first&nbsp;visible part of the universe, originated. The Egyptians&nbsp;therefore had been punished by all the elements that make&nbsp;up the globe that we live on, including the region known as&nbsp;outer space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These ten plagues had been orchestrated by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem, </span><span class="font5">Moses, and Aaron. The first three plagues were the direct&nbsp;result of Aaron and Moses’ staff. They produced changes in&nbsp;the lowest region of our universe by employing the basest of&nbsp;the four elements of which the universe consists. Two were&nbsp;using water and one used earth as its medium. Moses&nbsp;orchestrated the next three plagues, utilising higher ranking&nbsp;elements in the atmosphere, corresponding to the fact that&nbsp;he ranked higher as a prophet than did his older brother&nbsp;Aaron. They were: hail, locust, and darkness. Moses&nbsp;demonstrated his control of the surface of the earth and the&nbsp;airspace surrounding it. G’d orchestrated the four plagues of&nbsp;wild beasts roaming unrestricted and killing. The pestilence&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">killed</span><span class="font5"> livestock, just as the plague of killing the firstborn.&nbsp;Finally, the plague of שחין, was orchestrated by Moses,&nbsp;Aaron and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashemt</span><span class="font5">; The former threw soot into the air and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> when the former threw soot (totally sterile matter)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hashem</span><span class="font5"> converted it into most harmful and painful boils on&nbsp;the Egyptians’ skins</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקם פרעה לילה</span><span class="font5">, “Pharaoh arose during the night;”&nbsp;the word לילה here describes a state of mind, both he and his&nbsp;advisors were as if </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">blindfolded</span><span class="font5"> with shock. (Compare&nbsp;commentary in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Torah</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> sh’leymah,</span><span class="font5"> item 526 on this verse)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרא למשה ואהרן, “</span><span class="font5">he had Moses and Aaron called&nbsp;to the Palace;” seeing that we have been told in 10,28: that&nbsp;Pharaoh had commanded Moses to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">leave</span><span class="font5"> his presence, he&nbsp;was now forced to countermand himself and beg Moses to&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">come</span><span class="font5"> to him as soon as possible, as the Torah reported that&nbsp;there was not a single house in which not at least one&nbsp;Egyptian had died. At first glance this statement sounds&nbsp;almost incredible, for surely not every house harboured a&nbsp;firstborn. The Egyptians would mark a house in which a&nbsp;firstborn had died with a portrait or statute of the deceased&nbsp;and put it on a pedestal inside the house in which he had&nbsp;lived as a kind of memorial. On this night all of these had&nbsp;been shattered at the time G’d struck the firstborn. This day&nbsp;now became as tragic for them as the day on which that&nbsp;particular first born had died and they had buried him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was not all; the Egyptians now buried their most recent dead (firstborn) in their own houses and the dogs&nbsp;found ways to drag out these corpses and to gorge&nbsp;themselves on their flesh. As a result, their relatives felt as&nbsp;badly as they had on the day they had buried them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.32. גם צאנכם גם בקרכם</span><span class="font5">, “also your flocks and your herds” (you may take with you). The repetition of the word גם&nbsp;is a hint that Pharaoh gave the Israelites also part of his own&nbsp;as well as of his servants’ flocks and herds to take along.&nbsp;Thus Moses’ prediction that not only would the Israelites&nbsp;sacrifice some of these animals for their G’d, but they would&nbsp;include animals formerly owned by Pharaoh and offer these&nbsp;at his request. (Compare 10,25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כלנו מתים</span><span class="font5">, “we are all about to die;” the word מתים&nbsp;here has to be understood as an activity, i.e. as if the Torah&nbsp;had written: כלנו הולכים ומתים, “we are all progressively dying.”&nbsp;The Egyptians remembered that Moses had warned that if&nbsp;the Israelites could not perform their rituals, their G’d would&nbsp;punish them with the sword and with pestilence (5,3) They&nbsp;reasoned that the G’d of the Hebrews would not only punish&nbsp;the Hebrews who had failed to honour Him (not through a&nbsp;fault of their own) but that He would certainly punish the ones&nbsp;who had prevented them from serving Him. When an&nbsp;Israelite would say to an Egyptian that he should wait until he&nbsp;would give back to him any valuable object that he had&nbsp;“borrowed,” he would tell him not to bother but to keep it. By&nbsp;doing so he hoped that his life would be spared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;צרורות בשמלותם</span><span class="font5">, “bundled up inside their&nbsp;garments.” This line is the reason why we have the practice&nbsp;of wrapping the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">afikomen”</span><span class="font5"> in a serviette or tablecloth after&nbsp;breaking it and saving it for being eaten at the end of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Seder</span><span class="font5"> meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על שכמם</span><span class="font5">, “over their shoulders.” The donkeys of the Israelites were already loaded with so much “loot” that they&nbsp;could not burden the animals with additional weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.36. וה' נתן את חן העם</span><span class="font5">, “and the Lord had disposed the Egyptians favourably towards this people;” this is how He&nbsp;fulfilled what He had said to Moses in Exodus 3,21, when He&nbsp;told him that the Israelites would not leave Egypt empty-handed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.37. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסעו בני ישראל מרעמסס סוכותה</span><span class="font5">, “The Israelites&nbsp;journeyed from the city of Ramses in the direction of Sukkot.”&nbsp;The whole people first had first assembled in Ramses; this&nbsp;was the city where they had performed most of their slave&nbsp;labour in that year [before the onset of the plagues when&nbsp;they had taken a “rest.” Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">סכותה, Rabbi Nechemyah said that the suffix ה in this word substitutes for the missing prefix ל.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,39. ויאפו את הבצק, </span><span class="font5">“they baked the dough;” they did this at Sukkot, which was their first way-station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי גורשו מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “for the Egyptians had literally been expelling them;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עוגות מצות</span><span class="font5">, into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzah</span><span class="font5"> cakes. Why did the Torah bother to give us these details? In the future observance of the&nbsp;Passover would become conditional on a number of rituals&nbsp;having been observed before one could participate in that&nbsp;celebration. The Torah explains that on </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">this occasion</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;only requirement had been that they eat unleavened bread,&nbsp;and the Passover “festival” was a one day affair due to the&nbsp;Egyptians having chased the Israelites out of their homes.&nbsp;We commemorate this during the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Seder</span><span class="font5"> evening by breaking&nbsp;the middle </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzah</span><span class="font5"> and reciting “this broken </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzah</span><span class="font5"> is the&nbsp;symbol of how our forefathers the Israelites observed&nbsp;Passover in Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,42. 'ליל שמורים הוא לה</span><span class="font5">, “it is a night of vigil for the Lord;” this is a reference to how G’d protected the Israelites&nbsp;from being harmed by the Destroyer when He struck Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is also a night of vigil for the Israelites for all </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">future </span><span class="font5">generations, a night on which they should not go to sleep;&nbsp;this is an allusion to the story told in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">haggadah</span><span class="font5"> about the&nbsp;five scholars in Bney Brak who spent the whole night&nbsp;reminiscing about that night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שמורים</span><span class="font5">, the first time this word appears it describes an event awaited that had not yet occurred; the second time it&nbsp;describes commemoration of an event that occurred in the&nbsp;past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the expression: ליל שמורים is a reminder to observe the anniversary of that night, and&nbsp;warns us not to forget to eat the Passover on that night. The&nbsp;root שמר occurs elsewhere in that context also, for instance:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">תשמרו</span><span class="font5"> להקריב לו במועדו, “be mindful to offer it at its appointed&nbsp;time.” (Numbers 28,2, the daily communal offering)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.43. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זאת חקת הפסח</span><span class="font5">, “this is the statute of the Passover;”&nbsp;this paragraph is of relevance for all future generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא יאכל בו, </span><span class="font5">“he must not eat thereof. (the gentile)” Compare a similar formulation i.e. (addressed to the outsider&nbsp;in the third person instead of directly) והנותר בבשר ובלחם, “and&nbsp;anything left over either from the meat or the bread, etc.”&nbsp;(Leviticus 8,32)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.44. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מקנת כסף</span><span class="font5">, “or acquired through purchase;” slaves&nbsp;whose bodies are owned by an Israelite (and who have been&nbsp;circumcised) may partake of the annual Passover. It also&nbsp;includes: wife and children living at home and provided for by&nbsp;their father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומלת אותו אז יאכל בו</span><span class="font5">, “when you circumcise him, then he may eat of it.” The reason why this is a repeat is to tell us&nbsp;that there is no waiting period after the circumcision. If for&nbsp;some reason the foreskin grew back, such a slave is not&nbsp;disqualified from eating of the Passover, as long as he had&nbsp;been ritually circumcised once. The same applies to slaves&nbsp;owned by a priest in whose home sacrificial meat or tithes&nbsp;called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah</span><span class="font5"> may be served on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.45. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תושב</span><span class="font5">, “a resident stranger;” this is how </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">understands the word תושב here. The legal status of such a&nbsp;“resident” stranger applies when he undertook to observe the&nbsp;seven universally applicable laws for disobedience to which&nbsp;any human being is culpable. Such a person is allowed to eat&nbsp;meat from animals that did not die through ritual slaughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Interestingly, when the same word appears in Leviticus 25,47, he explains it as: a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Jewish</span><span class="font5"> servant (sold by the court&nbsp;for having stolen and not repaid). Some commentators say&nbsp;that the word תושב here refers only to eating of the Passover,&nbsp;whereas in Leviticus is refers to the eating of the tithes called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,46 בבית אחד יאכל</span><span class="font5">, “it (all of it) must be consumed in one house;” according to the plain meaning this means that&nbsp;the Passover lamb must be consumed in the house of the&nbsp;owner. No parts of it may be sent to friends or&nbsp;acquaintances. When one consumes something in a hurry&nbsp;one does not have time to attend to such niceties. These&nbsp;considerations are only in place when one sits down to a&nbsp;meal that has been carefully prepared and is consumed at&nbsp;one’s leisure. This is also </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">one</span><span class="font5"> of the reasons why the Torah&nbsp;forbade any Israelite to leave his home during that night until&nbsp;morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועצם לא תשברו בו</span><span class="font5">, “you must not break a single of its bones.” In other words, it is forbidden to eat any of its&nbsp;marrow. Looking for marrow is also one way of delaying your&nbsp;departure when you are summoned, and you have to be&nbsp;ready to leave your house at a moment’s notice. Every&nbsp;person invited to participate in that meal is to take his portion&nbsp;and not waste time about breaking bones and extracting&nbsp;marrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the prohibition not to break a bone: The Torah had commanded to eat the meat of the&nbsp;Passover על השובע, i.e. at the conclusion of the meal so that it&nbsp;is what brings on the feeling of having been satiated. In that&nbsp;way, the last taste in our mouth on that evening is that of the&nbsp;roasted meat of the lamb. If we were to break bones and&nbsp;suck out the marrow, the last taste of the evening would be&nbsp;that of marrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand the expression: על השובע, as meaning that there should be a big enough portion&nbsp;for everyone at the table so that they would be satiated&nbsp;without having to look for the marrow in the bones before&nbsp;becoming satiated. Some people reject this interpretation as&nbsp;too far fetched, as the Torah only needed to write </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">positively</span><span class="font5">,&nbsp;“eat to your heart’s content,” instead of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">negatively</span><span class="font5">: “do not&nbsp;break a bone of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When looked at in connection with the laws governing the פסח שני, the observing of the Passover rites a month later&nbsp;if one could not observe it on the 14<sup>th</sup> of Nissan for a&nbsp;legitimate reason, the Torah writes that all the rules applying&nbsp;to that substitute are </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">identical</span><span class="font5"> to those that apply to the&nbsp;Passover on the fourteenth of Nissan. (Numbers 9,12.)&nbsp;However, in spite of this, the Torah adds there in the same&nbsp;verse that not a bone of the lamb must be broken. This&nbsp;shows that there must be a different reason than those we&nbsp;have mentioned for why this rule was added.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must therefore assume that not only bones that contain marrow are included in this legislation but also bones&nbsp;that do not contain marrow. If there is meat less than the size&nbsp;of an olive attached to such a bone, it must not be “broken,&nbsp;i.e. treated as if it contained marrow and the owner wishes to&nbsp;gnaw it clean. This is what we have learned from tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> folio 85. [In other words: while on the one hand&nbsp;we are commanded not to leave anything over, we must also&nbsp;not treat that lamb as if it saved us from imminent starvation.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.47. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל עדת בני ישראל יעשו אותו</span><span class="font5">, “the entire community of&nbsp;the Children of Israel is to perform it. (that commandment).”&nbsp;The lesson from this verse is that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">also</span><span class="font5"> in future generations&nbsp;this is a communal commandment, but participation is not&nbsp;limited to immediate family members. (Compare Malbim).&nbsp;[The word “also” in the version of the commentary is an&nbsp;obvious error, as the Passover in Egypt was specifically&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">restricted</span><span class="font5"> to the members of each household. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.48. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשה פסח</span><span class="font5">, “and he wishes to perform the&nbsp;commandment of participating in the Passover ritual;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה כאזרח הארץ, ”</span><span class="font5">so that he will feel as if a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">natural</span><span class="font5"> born Jew (from birth);” the example is meant to portray a gentile&nbsp;who upon hearing the history of the Jewish people has&nbsp;decided to convert to that religion/nation; it might be thought&nbsp;that since his forefathers did not suffer servitude in Egypt he&nbsp;could not do so; the Torah therefore states that as soon as&nbsp;he has undergone ritual circumcision his past history has&nbsp;been wiped out and he is treated as if he had been born a&nbsp;Jew and shared their suffering throughout the ages. Just as a&nbsp;natural born Jew who for a valid reason was unable to&nbsp;observe the Passover in the month of Nissan has been&nbsp;granted a second chance, so has the new convert who could&nbsp;not observe it before conversion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל ערל לא יאכל בו</span><span class="font5">, “no uncircumcised person must eat of it.” Being uncircumcised is considered as being physically&nbsp;repulsive, ugly, as we have learned in the Talmud&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim,</span><span class="font5"> folio 96.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.49. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תורה אחת יהיה</span><span class="font5">, “one Torah (law) there shall be.”&nbsp;The word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah</span><span class="font5"> appears here as masculine (יהיה) after first&nbsp;having been described as feminine (אחת</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">). </span><span class="font5">Usually it appears&nbsp;only as feminine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[In the opinion of this editor, this type of incongruity is always a reminder that the Torah could not have been written&nbsp;by a human being, as a human being would not want to be&nbsp;guilty of such grammatical inconsistency. Such “errors” would&nbsp;long ago have been “edited” out. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הגר הגר בתוככם</span><span class="font5">, “the stranger that resides amongst you.” The term refers to a proselyte who has been converted by a&nbsp;competent court, as opposed to one who has taken a legal&nbsp;shortcut to conversion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.50. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויעשו כל בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “all the Children of Israel&nbsp;performed, etc.” here as well as in 8,14, it is impossible to&nbsp;translate this line literally, i.e. that every single member of the&nbsp;Jewish people performed the Passover ritual, (minors and&nbsp;babies included); the meaning is simply that the Jewish&nbsp;people ever since, annually performed the ritual of the&nbsp;Passover. We find similar “inaccuracy” in Exodus 8,14,&nbsp;where the Torah wrote: ויעשו כן החרטומים, which literally&nbsp;translated would mean: “the sorcerers performed the same&nbsp;miracle.” Had they been able to perform the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> miracle or&nbsp;even to reverse it, they would not have been ”sorcerers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.51. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי בעצם היום הזה</span><span class="font5">, “it was on that very same day;”&nbsp;these words have to be read as linked to what the Torah&nbsp;wrote in verse 41 where it described the departure of the&nbsp;Jewish people from Egypt in the same terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If proof were needed that this is the correct interpretation, compare Numbers 3,13: כי לי כל בכור ביום הכותי&nbsp;כל בכור וגו', “for every firstborn Israelite belongs to Me, since&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">the day</span><span class="font5"> when I smote all the firstborn of Egypt, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,2. כל בכור</span><span class="font5">, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font5"> firstborn;” this refers to the firstborn&nbsp;human </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">male</span><span class="font5">; in earlier times sacrificial rituals were&nbsp;performed exclusively by such firstborn males.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באדם ובבהמה</span><span class="font5">, “of man or domesticated beast;” this comparison of the firstborn human being to the firstborn&nbsp;domestic animal, means that just as a firstborn human being&nbsp;belongs to G’d, so a firstborn domestic animal belongs to the&nbsp;priest, G’d’s representative on earth. Just as the redemption&nbsp;of a firstborn human being takes place on the thirty first day&nbsp;of his life, so the firstborn domestic beast has to be given to&nbsp;the priest on the thirty first day of its life. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mechilta Pisscha&nbsp;16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;היום אתם יוצאים</span><span class="font5">; this is an exclamation equivalent&nbsp;to: “remember that you are leaving Egypt in the month of&nbsp;spring” (nature’s renewal)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיה כי יביאך</span><span class="font5">, “it will be when </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> will bring you,&nbsp;etc.” the Torah repeats that the prohibition to eat leavened&nbsp;products on Passover will remain in force also when the&nbsp;people are settled in their own country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שבעת ימים תאכל מצות</span><span class="font5">, “you will eat </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzot</span><span class="font5"> for seven&nbsp;days.” Here too the Torah repeats this to leave no doubt that&nbsp;this law will remain in force when the people have reached&nbsp;their destination and settled in the land of Canaan (Israel).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וביום השביעי חג, </span><span class="font5">“and the seventh day you will observe as a festival.” “Why did the Torah here not mention that the first&nbsp;day was also to be observed as a festival?” (Our author&nbsp;appears to be the only one having raised this question.)&nbsp;Possibly it had already been answered by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’mot rabbah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">who points out that a reminder of this has already been found&nbsp;in verse three, where the Torah commanded “to remember&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font5"> day (the 15<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan) on</span><span class="font5"> which the Lord took you out of&nbsp;Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,8. והגדת לבנך</span><span class="font5">, “you will tell your son, etc.;” the son who is too young to pose the question, you will tell </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> his&nbsp;having asked: “why did G’d saw fit to make Pharaoh kick out&nbsp;the Jews before their dough had even had a chance to be&nbsp;baked into bread? Did He not have the power to keep them&nbsp;there until they could at least have taken baked bread with&nbsp;them?” You will answer the question you have put into the&nbsp;mouth of the שאינו יודע לשאול, the child that is as yet not&nbsp;curious to formulate his own questions: בעבור זה, “in order to&nbsp;make sure that I will observe these commandments involving&nbsp;the Passover sacrifice, the unleavened bread, and the bitter&nbsp;herbs as a commemoration of all the miracles he performed&nbsp;for me then when I came out of Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעבור זה עשה ה' לי</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> this is a hint of the answer to be given to the son called רשע in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">haggadah of&nbsp;Pessach. Rashi</span><span class="font5"> means that this is the answer to be given to&nbsp;the wicked son who does not even bother to ask about what&nbsp;is special on these days, and especially on the first night</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">The word לי, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">for me,”</span><span class="font5"> and not for someone like him, would&nbsp;make this a suitable answer for the wicked son described in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">haggadah</span><span class="font5"> as reacting to all the ritual he observes with a&nbsp;derisive: “why are </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">you</span><span class="font5"> going to all this trouble?” The word לי&nbsp;implies that if </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">had been there at the time, G’d most&nbsp;certainly would not have bothered either with redeeming </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">him&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">or any of the miracles leading up to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.9, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיה לך לאות על ידך</span><span class="font5">, “it shall be a symbol, (tangible&nbsp;reminder) for you on your hand (and arm);” all of this is part&nbsp;of what you are to tell your son. It is inscribed on the first&nbsp;parchment inside the phylacteries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לך לאות, </span><span class="font5">“for you as a symbol;” logic dictates that first and foremost the phylacteries are to serve as historical reminder&nbsp;for you (sing.) on your arm (where not everyone can see it,&nbsp;but once you have put on phylacteries as a historical&nbsp;reminder for yourself, it must also serve as such for all the&nbsp;other Jews, (and gentiles) i.e. you must wear another one of&nbsp;the phylacteries on your forehead to trumpet this message to&nbsp;all who see you, i.e. בין עיניך, literally: “between your eyes.”&nbsp;Thus will be fulfilled what is written in Deuteronomy 28,10:&nbsp;וראו כל עמי הארץ כי שם ה' נקרא עליך, “and all the nations of the&nbsp;earth will see that the name of the Lord has been proclaimed&nbsp;upon you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מימים ימימה</span><span class="font5">, “from year to year;” this is a reminder&nbsp;that one has to examine one’s תפילין, phylacteries once every&nbsp;year to check the writing on the parchments. This is the&nbsp;opinion of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">school</span><span class="font5"> of Hillel. (His disciples) They based&nbsp;themselves on the fact that elsewhere the meaning of the&nbsp;word ימים means “days,” or maximum “a year.” The school of&nbsp;Shammai holds that they need to be examined only once in a&nbsp;lifetime. Hillel the elder, is reputed to have shown someone&nbsp;the phylactery of his grandfather. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta, Pisscha,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">section&nbsp;17). In the Talmud </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">folio 92, Yehudah ben&nbsp;Beteyrah who claimed to be one the dead resurrected by the&nbsp;prophet Ezekiel, is reputed to have shown the phylacteries&nbsp;that his father had bequeathed to him as stemming from that&nbsp;generation. (about 300 years prior)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,11. והיה כי יביאך</span><span class="font5">, “it will be when He brings you, etc.” the reason this introductory line is repeated here is so that&nbsp;we should not think that only the firstborn that came out of&nbsp;Egypt needed to be sanctified. The Torah therefore makes it&nbsp;clear that this law continues to apply to children born as&nbsp;firstborn to their parents in the Hoy Land (and in the Diaspora&nbsp;in due course)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל ארץ הכנעני, </span><span class="font5">“to the land of the Canaanite;” the reason why the Canaanites had a legal claim to that country was&nbsp;that the children of Chet, a friend of Avraham, honoured&nbsp;Abraham and when they heard that G’d had promised this&nbsp;land to our forefathers, they emigrated from that land to&nbsp;make it available to the descendants of Avraham. In&nbsp;appreciation of that, G’d rewarded them by this land&nbsp;becoming known as “the land of Canaan.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta Pisscha,&nbsp;chapter 18.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">)</span><span class="font5"> [According to my version of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">printed in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chumash</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Malbim’s</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">commentary, it was&nbsp;not one of the Hittites that was so “generous,” but Canaan&nbsp;the grandson of Noach, whom his grandfather had cursed.&nbsp;According to that version he was rewarded with being given&nbsp;a land in Africa </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">superior</span><span class="font5"> to the land in which he had resided&nbsp;at the time. Canaan, a grandson of Noach may well have still&nbsp;been alive during the lifetime of Avraham. I do not know how&nbsp;this jives with Canaan having been condemned to be a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">slave&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">to his brothers. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר נשבע לך</span><span class="font5">, “as He has sworn to you.” The meaning of the line is: “you will </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">receive </span><span class="font5">it as an ancestral heritage as G’d&nbsp;had </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sworn </span><span class="font5">to your forefathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'והעברת כל פטר רחם לה</span><span class="font5">, “you shall set apart for the&nbsp;Lord every first issue of the womb;” we encounter a similar&nbsp;expression in Numbers 27,8: והעברתם את נחלתו אל בתו, “you&nbsp;will set side his inheritance for his daughter.” In that instance,&nbsp;the inheritance of potential male heirs is set aside for a&nbsp;female heir, a daughter if there is one. Here too, the firstborn&nbsp;is set apart from the other heirs as an inheritance for the&nbsp;Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל פטר שגר בהמה</span><span class="font5">, likewise every male firstling that emerges from the womb of a beast;” at that time the&nbsp;Israelites did not own any ritually impure beasts except&nbsp;donkeys; (no camels or horses) this is why there was no&nbsp;need for the Torah to add the expression: טהורה, “ritually&nbsp;pure,” in our verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.13.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכל פטר חמור, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">and every firstling of a donkey;” this&nbsp;paragraph has been repeated because the laws about the&nbsp;firstlings of donkeys, and the redemption of them was a&nbsp;totally new concept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">בבניך תפדה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">as well as amongst your sons, you have to redeem.” This law did not become applicable until after the&nbsp;Levites had become sanctified in lieu of the firstborn sons&nbsp;during the second year of the Israelites in the desert.&nbsp;(Numbers 3,45)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?מה זאת</span><span class="font5">, “what is the significance of this?” Seeing&nbsp;that your son observes that neither a gentile nor an&nbsp;uncircumcised Israelite is permitted to partake of the&nbsp;Passover meat, something that sets the festival of Passover&nbsp;apart from all other festivals, he is entitled to ask the reason&nbsp;for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the words: מה זאת, do not refer to Passover and the unleavened bread, the reason for which&nbsp;we have already read about. However, the son asks, on the&nbsp;new concept of redeeming something that was perceived as&nbsp;sacred for something that was perceived as secular; you, the&nbsp;father, are to answer him in the words of the Torah that we&nbsp;imitate what G’d had done with the firstborn sons and beasts&nbsp;of the Israelites in Egypt on that night when He exempted&nbsp;them from execution at His hands. In exchange for being&nbsp;saved, we offer a sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,16.והיה לאות על ידכה, </span><span class="font5">“it shall be as a symbol on your hand;” the phylactery to be worn on the head is to serve as a&nbsp;symbol for the “strong hand,” with which G’d compelled the&nbsp;Egyptians to release the Israelites, as mentioned in the&nbsp;previous verse; the phylactery to be worn on the forehead&nbsp;however, is to be a reminder of the miracles G’d had&nbsp;performed as stated in Deuteronomy 6,22: ויתן ה' אותות&nbsp;ומופתים גדולים ורעים בפרעה ובמצרים לעינינו, “the Lord performed&nbsp;signs and miracles great and awesome before our eyes&nbsp;against Pharaoh and the Egyptians.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ידכה, </span><span class="font5">the unusual spelling instead of ידך alerts us to the need to wear the phylactery on the left arm, our weaker arm.&nbsp;Seeing that we use our right arm for all manner of activities, it&nbsp;is not fitting that the holy name of G’d be attached to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: our sages have stated that seeing that the right arm and hand are used to attach the&nbsp;phylactery to our left arm, instead of vice versa, and in most&nbsp;instances the left arm or hand are called יד, there is nothing&nbsp;surprising in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולטוטפות</span><span class="font5">, the word means: “something to look at.” We find in this context in Deuteronomy 28,10: וראו כל עמי הארץ כי&nbsp;שם ה' נקרא עלדך, “and all the nations of the earth will </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">see </span><span class="font5">that&nbsp;the name of the Lord) has been proclaimed upon you.”&nbsp;(Compare Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">megillah 14</span><span class="font5"> מטייפין)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat B’shalach</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,17. ויהי בשלח פרעה את העם</span><span class="font5">, “It was when Pharaoh had let the people go;” the reason why the Torah did not write&nbsp;that “Pharaoh let the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Israelites</span><span class="font5"> go,” is because the word העם&nbsp;included fellow travelers who had joined the Jewish nation,&nbsp;as well as spies who would report back to Pharaoh on the&nbsp;route they had taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא נחם אלו־הים</span><span class="font5">, ”and G’d had not led them, etc.” G’d did not lead them on the shortest route that led to the land of&nbsp;Canaan; the letter ו in the word ולא is superfluous (if that was&nbsp;all this meant)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דרך ארץ פלשתים כי קרוב הוא</span><span class="font5">, “the route which runs through the land of the Philistines; although (or because), it was the&nbsp;shortest route.” According to our author what is meant is&nbsp;“although,” despite, the fact that it was the shortest route. We&nbsp;find a similar meaning for the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי </span><span class="font5">in Exodus 19,5: כי לי כל&nbsp;הארץ, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">although</span><span class="font5"> the whole earth belongs to Me.” Another&nbsp;example of this meaning of the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי </span><span class="font5">is found in Psalms</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">41,5, “heal me </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">although</span><span class="font5"> I have sinned against You.” רפאה&nbsp;נפשי כי חטאתי לך.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider also Genesis 48,14: שכל ידיו כי מנשה הבכור, “he crossed his hands although Menashe was the firstborn.” In&nbsp;our context, although there was an additional boundary to be&nbsp;crossed between Egypt and the land of Canaan, namely the&nbsp;land of the Philistines, as we know from when while in the&nbsp;land of the Philistines G’d had commanded Yitzchok not to&nbsp;continue on to Egypt on account of the famine in the land of&nbsp;Canaan, (Genesis 26,1) so that it seemed strange that G’d&nbsp;did not lead the Israelites by this route, He was afraid that if&nbsp;they would find resistance to their traversing that land, they&nbsp;would refer to return to Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אמר אלוקים פן ינחם העם</span><span class="font5">, “for G’d had said: “lest the people have remorse;” we must not criticize this verse by&nbsp;saying that it cannot be reconciled with G’d’s Omniscience,&nbsp;i.e. that He did know all this in advance; besides, surely if G’d&nbsp;had wanted to He could have led the Israelites through the&nbsp;land of the Philistines without their coming to any harm;&nbsp;however, what is written here is an answer to the attribute of&nbsp;Justice which wanted to exploit that opportunity to accuse the&nbsp;Israelites of lack of faith in their G’d. Precisely, because G’d&nbsp;was aware that the Israelites were not yet in a condition to&nbsp;withstand the Satan, He decided not to give the Satan that&nbsp;opportunity at this time. We find an example of a similar&nbsp;situation in Genesis 3,22 where G’d is portrayed as being&nbsp;“afraid” that Adam and Eve after having eaten from the tree&nbsp;of knowledge and having forfeited immortality might eat from&nbsp;the tree of life in order to regain it, and to thereby nullify the&nbsp;penalty G’d had imposed upon them. The Torah, justifying&nbsp;G’d’s expelling them from the garden, wrote there: ועתה פן&nbsp;ישלח ידו, “and now, lest he will extend his hand, etc.” There&nbsp;too you could have asked: “seeing that G’d knew what would&nbsp;happen, why did He not remove the tree, instead of depriving&nbsp;mankind of access to the garden?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בראותם מלחמה </span><span class="font5">“when they would see they would be involved in war;” The Philistines would attack them, thinking&nbsp;that the Israelites were approaching in order avenge the&nbsp;30000 men of Ephrayim they had killed 30 years previously&nbsp;when these people having miscalculated the time when their&nbsp;redemption was due had taken matters into their own hands&nbsp;and had marched out of Egypt in order to recapture their&nbsp;homeland. Their miscalculation had been that they thought&nbsp;the 400 years mentioned at the covenant of the pieces in&nbsp;Genesis 15,13 had commenced then and not at the birth of&nbsp;Yitzchok. Actually, the 430 years mentioned in Exodus 12,40&nbsp;had commenced then, (although </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5"> has trouble&nbsp;accounting for this). According to Yonatan ben Uzziel this&nbsp;may have been what Pharaoh had counted on. A grandson&nbsp;of Avimelch attacked the members of Ephrayim. According to&nbsp;Chronicles I 7,20, the battle with the Philistines occurred at&nbsp;Gat. According to some scholars the members of the tribe of&nbsp;Ephrayim killed during that battle were the “dried bones”&nbsp;resurrected by the prophet Ezekiel, (Ezekiel 37)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי קרוב הוא</span><span class="font5">, “for he was very close to him;” according to some scholars Pharaoh and Avimelech of the Philistines&nbsp;were politically very close to one another, and Pharaoh&nbsp;counted on the Philistines to bring the Israelites back to him.&nbsp;He also counted on the promise of Avraham to Avimelech&nbsp;valid for 4 generations hence not to engage in hostilities&nbsp;against him. Actually, a grandson of the Avimelech with&nbsp;whom Avraham, had concluded a non aggression pact, a&nbsp;pact that his son Yitzchok had renewed, was still alive when&nbsp;the Israelites left Egypt. Avraham’s descendants did not&nbsp;engage in warfare with the Philistines for seven generations.&nbsp;(Moses was the seventh generation from Avraham). All these&nbsp;considerations prompted G’d not to lead the Israelites on the&nbsp;shortest route to the Holy Land. [Besides, if G’d meant for&nbsp;them to receive the Torah at Mount Sinai, this would have&nbsp;been quite impossible, and G’d had told Moses already at the&nbsp;burning bush that one of the reasons why He redeemed&nbsp;them earlier than expected was that they would receive the&nbsp;Torah at that site. Ed.] Our author also quotes the liturgist&nbsp;who in his poem makes reference to these points. For all the&nbsp;reasons quoted, G’d ensured that the Israelites did not take&nbsp;the route that had proven so tragic for the members of the&nbsp;tribe of Ephrayim some thirty years earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בראותם מלחמה</span><span class="font5">, “when they come face to face with war.” This would have been a war on two fronts, the pursuing&nbsp;Egyptians at their back and the furious Philistines facing&nbsp;them, trying to force them back to their allies the Egyptians.&nbsp;Our author had explained already on Genesis 21,22 where&nbsp;the fact that the barren Sarah had given birth to a son for&nbsp;Avraham, that the prophecies given to him started to be&nbsp;taken seriously by the rulers of that time. Up until then they&nbsp;had not worried about these prophecies. In Joshua 13,3, we&nbsp;read about the Israelites indeed having had to face enemies&nbsp;on two fronts when Joshua had aged and not yet conquered&nbsp;all of the land of Canaan as he had been instructed to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושבו מצרימה</span><span class="font5">. “and they will prefer to return to Egypt.” That this was a logical consideration is born out by the fact&nbsp;that the Israelites, even though not having taken that route,&nbsp;were on the point of voluntarily returning to Egypt on&nbsp;numerous occasions, on most occasions when they faced&nbsp;problems in the desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,18. דרך המדבר ים סוף</span><span class="font5">, “the route through the desert bordering the sea of reed.” The word של, “of” was omitted&nbsp;here as something that the reader can fill in for himself, just&nbsp;as it has been omitted in “הארון הברית,” in Joshua 3,14, where&nbsp;we read: הארון הברית instead of הארון שהוא ארון הברית, “the ark,&nbsp;which is the ark housing the covenant.” In Genesis 2,9 we&nbsp;find a similar construction, i.e. עץ הדעת טוב ורע, where we&nbsp;would have expected instead: עץ שהוא דעת טוב ורע, “the tree&nbsp;which is (the key) to knowledge of good and evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחמושים</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the meaning of the word is: “armed.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the fear of the Israelites was&nbsp;not due to their not having arms with which to defend&nbsp;themselves. They were well armed. You are not to wonder&nbsp;where the Israelites had taken all these arms from, arms&nbsp;which they used in the desert for several wars, starting&nbsp;immediately after they had crossed the sea of reeds and had&nbsp;been attacked by the Amalekites. They needed these arms&nbsp;again when the conquered the land of Canaan under the&nbsp;leadership of Joshua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of the word: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חמושים</span><span class="font5">. The word refers to provisions for the journey. The word is used in&nbsp;Genesis 41,34, where it describes the provisions stored by&nbsp;Joseph in anticipation of the seven years of famine that were&nbsp;to follow the seven years of plenty. In practice this meant&nbsp;(according to tradition) that the dough the Israelites took with&nbsp;them lasted them a whole month until the 15<sup>th</sup> of lyar, when&nbsp;the heavenly food, the manna took over. The reason for the&nbsp;need for that miracle had been that G’d took the people on a&nbsp;detour through the desert. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי השבע השביע</span><span class="font5">, the repetition of the words “he made swear repeatedly,” was that Joseph did not know which&nbsp;generation would experience the Exodus. Joseph had told&nbsp;his brothers that by committing them to this oath he was not&nbsp;asking them for a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">favour</span><span class="font5">: they who had been instrumental in&nbsp;his being dragged to Egypt as a slave -if they wanted to&nbsp;complete the act of repentance,-must ensure that he would&nbsp;be brought to burial in the land of his forefathers from where&nbsp;he had been kidnapped. He had performed a mission on his&nbsp;father’s behalf when he came to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem</span><span class="font5"> (Genesis 37,14)&nbsp;and this is why he expected to be buried near there. This is&nbsp;where he was interred eventually, as we know from Joshua&nbsp;24,32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,20. ויסעו מסכות</span><span class="font5">, “they journeyed from Sukkot;” on the second day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,21.</span><span class="font5">, “and the Lord, etc:” the letter ו at the beginning of the word indicates that G’d’s “entourage” accompanied</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Him.” An alternate interpretation: the letter ו, as we mentioned already on Genesis 19,24, refers to the angel&nbsp;Gavriel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ללכת יומם ולילה, </span><span class="font5">“to keep marching both by day and by night, in order to convince Pharaoh that the Israelites were&nbsp;fleeing. This would make him pursue them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,22. עמוד הענן יומם</span><span class="font5">, “the pillar of cloud by day;” The only other time when the word: יומם occurs in the Torah is&nbsp;when it describes a period when the sun shines on earth. On&nbsp;the other hand, the expression יום, occurs also both in the&nbsp;Torah and in the rest of the Bible when describing a&nbsp;particular day regardless of whether is daylight at the time. In&nbsp;the Torah we find: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ביום</span><span class="font5"> הכותי כל בכור (Numbers 3,13) although&nbsp;we know that it was at midnight. In the Book of prophets we&nbsp;find the word יום applied to something that happened at night&nbsp;in Kings II 7,9: היום הזה יום בשורה, “this day, the day of good&nbsp;tidings.” It is clear from the context that these words were&nbsp;spoken at night. The speakers added: “let us wait with&nbsp;bringing this news until morning.” In Psalms 88,2 we read: יום&nbsp;צעקתי בלילה נגדך, “a day when I cry out at night before You.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא ימיש</span><span class="font5">, “it did not depart;” the word used is in the future tense, however; we would have expected the Torah to have&nbsp;written: לא מש instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,2. וישבו</span><span class="font5">, “so that they shall turn back;” G’d said that&nbsp;He did not want the Egyptians to be able to say that Moses&nbsp;and Aaron had deceived him when they said that all they had&nbsp;requested was to travel three days into the desert (Exodus&nbsp;8,23).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לפני פי החירות</span><span class="font5">, “facing a place called: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pee Hachirot,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">the entrance to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hachirot;”</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">this place was&nbsp;identical to the fortification of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pittom</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> one of the first two cities&nbsp;to have been built by the Israelite slaves. The reason why the&nbsp;Torah refers to it by a different name here was that it was the&nbsp;first town the Israelites encountered as free men. (חרות,&nbsp;freedom) The Egyptians had no cause to complain about the&nbsp;newly gained freedom of the Israelites as pointed out by&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pessikta zutrata,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">(compare </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Torah schleymah</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> item 9 on this&nbsp;verse) where it is stated that it was the accepted practice of&nbsp;the Egyptians that if he succeeded in getting as far way as&nbsp;Pittom, he would have gained his legal freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate exegesis: the words לפני פי החירות, mean that the reason why the Torah mentions that location is to&nbsp;mislead Pharaoh into thinking that the Israelites had gotten&nbsp;lost, as a result of which they had second thoughts about&nbsp;leaving Egypt, and the proof is that they encamped at that&nbsp;location, one familiar to them as they had built the&nbsp;fortifications in that town, it being known to them as Pittom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">נכחו, “it was opposite;” a place called פי החירות, “perhaps best translated as “gateway to freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">תחנו על הים, (Moses instructing the people in the name of G’d) “you will encamp alongside the shores of the sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ורדף אחריהם</span><span class="font5">, “he will pursue them;” when Pharaoh&nbsp;would engage them in battle they would attempt to flee, and&nbsp;he would pursue them. He would become guilty in the eyes&nbsp;of G’d for not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">allowing</span><span class="font5"> them to return to Egypt [as they had&nbsp;promised they would. Ed.] As a result of this they could not&nbsp;be blamed for not bringing back the valuables that they had&nbsp;“borrowed.” At any rate, the houses and fields that they had&nbsp;left behind amounted to more in value than the chattels they&nbsp;had taken with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וידעו</span><span class="font5">, “they will know, etc.” this refers to the Egyptians who had remained in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויגד למלך מצרים</span><span class="font5">, meanwhile the King of Egypt had&nbsp;received information, etc.” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> he had&nbsp;received this information from the spies that he had sent&nbsp;along with the Israelites when they were leaving Ramses.&nbsp;They reported that after three days had passed the Israelites&nbsp;had not made any move indicating that they would return.&nbsp;According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the Israelites had marched only a&nbsp;distance of a single day. On the next day they had marched&nbsp;from Sukkot to Eytam, and on the third day they had turned&nbsp;around, so that by that time they were only a day’s march&nbsp;away from the Egyptian border. All this is based on the&nbsp;words: “they turned around and they encamped.” According&nbsp;to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> then, they had presented offerings to G’d while&nbsp;facing Egypt all day long on the third day. The spies reported&nbsp;that on the following day that they had not made any move in&nbsp;the direction of Egypt. This they interpreted as proof that they&nbsp;intended to flee. According to this, the Israelites would have&nbsp;remained stationary until Pharaoh caught up with them. This&nbsp;is based on the Torah writing that Pharaoh caught up with&nbsp;them while they were along the sea. (verse 9) According to&nbsp;this, the Egyptians engaged in pursuing them on the fifth and&nbsp;sixth day, even though the people had not moved further&nbsp;away at all. We would have to explain this by assuming that&nbsp;an army which travels with chariots, etc., as described,&nbsp;moves more slowly than an ordinary army or cavalry.&nbsp;Otherwise, it makes no sense that they did not face their&nbsp;adversary until the sixth or seventh day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהפוך לבב פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “Pharaoh experienced a change of heart;” the expression implies that he was sorry about what&nbsp;he had done. We have an example of this expression being&nbsp;used in that context in Lamentations 1,20: נהפך לבי בקרבי, “my&nbsp;heart is in anguish.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,6. ויאסור את רכבו</span><span class="font5">, “he harnessed his chariot;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> he did this personally, not ordering his&nbsp;servants to do so. This is interpreted as part of the&nbsp;psychology of people who are extremely angry. They give&nbsp;vent to their anger by involving themselves personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,8. ביד רמה, </span><span class="font5">“fully confident;” they thought that they had nothing to fear as they had left Egypt with permission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,10. והנה מצרים נוסע אחריהם</span><span class="font5">, “and here the Egyptians are pursuing them!” The Torah uses the singular mode for&nbsp;describing all these Egyptian soldiers and their officers. We&nbsp;have found examples of this in Numbers 13,23: ויבא עד חברון,&nbsp;“he came as far as Chevron,” when actually the Torah&nbsp;speaks of 12 spies. Or, another example: Joshua 8,19: האורב&nbsp;קם מהרה ממקומו, “The people lying in ambush arose quickly&nbsp;from their place.” The word: ממקומו, means: “from its place.”&nbsp;There were actually only 5000 Egyptian soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וייראו מאד</span><span class="font5">, “They were very scared.” Why would 600000 male, able bodied, Israelites, be so scared of 5000&nbsp;Egyptians? We had been told that they were all armed! Their&nbsp;fear was based on their slave mentality. Every slave is afraid&nbsp;of his master. These Israelites had not yet proven to&nbsp;themselves that they could fend for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,11. להוציאנו</span><span class="font5">, “To take us out;” we have to understand&nbsp;this word as if the letter א, had the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzeyreh</span><span class="font5"> under it.&nbsp;This would be the correct transitive form of this word at this&nbsp;place. (Compare Ibn Ezra) There are several examples of&nbsp;this in the Bible, also in the reverse use of the respective&nbsp;vowels. (Vocalization was provided by the teachers of the&nbsp;Torah. Moses did not write the Torah down with vowels. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואתם תחרישון, </span><span class="font5">“you only have to keep silent!” Do&nbsp;not keep on complaining to me accusing me as being “guilty”&nbsp;of taking you out of slavery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.15. ?מה תצעק אלי, </span><span class="font5">Why do you cry out to Me?” According to the plain meaning of the text Moses was quite&nbsp;sure that the Israelites would be helped and saved. Had G’d&nbsp;not told him: “I will deal very severely with Pharaoh? (verse&nbsp;4) The question was addressed to the Israelites through&nbsp;Moses. The Torah is full of examples when G’d speaks to&nbsp;Moses, as representative of the whole Jewish nation. He is&nbsp;taking issue with the fact that the Israelites were complaining&nbsp;instead of displaying a little bit of faith by wading into the sea.&nbsp;G’d tells Moses to command them to get moving. He had&nbsp;already told them that He would fight on their behalf. (verse&nbsp;14) They should therefore have been certain that G’d would&nbsp;not let the Egyptians defeat them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואתה, הרם את מטך</span><span class="font5">, “as far as you are concerned&nbsp;“raise your staff, etc,” Moses was not to lift his staff in order&nbsp;to orchestrate a miracle, but on the contrary, he was to raise&nbsp;his staff so that the people could see that the miracle was&nbsp;possible not only by means of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">striking</span><span class="font5"> the sea with his staff.&nbsp;G’d told Moses that all he had to do was make a threatening&nbsp;gesture and the waters would already split. Our author&nbsp;quotes examples of similar constructions, citing Daniel 8,11&nbsp;הורם התמיד, “the daily communal offering was removed;” or&nbsp;Isaiah 57,14: הרימו מכשול מדרך עמי, “remove obstacles from the&nbsp;path of My people.” Verse 21 tells us that as soon as Moses</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">extended his staff G’d was making the sea respond to the east wind etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסע מלאך האלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “G’d’s angel travelled, etc.” the&nbsp;Torah speaks of the angel that moves the pillar of cloud and&nbsp;the pillar of fire. (Compare comment on 13,21) Previously the&nbsp;Torah had simply spoken of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> walking ahead of the&nbsp;Israelites, without mentioning the word “angel.” Seeing that&nbsp;an angel is always a messenger of G’d, the Torah had simply&nbsp;referred to him a “G’d.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: whereas initially the Torah had not given us specifics about what medium G’d employed, it&nbsp;now gives us more detail. [Possibly, seeing we have been&nbsp;told that one angel normally is charged with only one task at&nbsp;a time, here the same angel performed what could be&nbsp;interpreted as more than one task. Ed.] At any rate, as a&nbsp;result of the angel’s activity there was absolute darkness&nbsp;between the camp of the Israelites and that of the Egyptian&nbsp;pursuers. This will be spelled out clearly in the verses&nbsp;following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבא בין מחנה</span><span class="font5">, “he positioned himself between the&nbsp;camp, etc.” the Torah refers to the cloud that was controlled&nbsp;by the angel taking up position between the two camps. We&nbsp;encounter something similar in Joshua 24,7: וישם מאפל ביניכם&nbsp;ובין במצרים ויבא עליהם את הים, “He placed darkness between&nbsp;you and the Egyptians and He brought the sea upon them.”&nbsp;(Joshua’s parting speech to the people before they dispersed&nbsp;to their respective portions of the Holy Land.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאר את הלילה, </span><span class="font5">“it lit up the night.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands the word ויאר as being derived from אור, light, in the transitive&nbsp;mode of the verb. If you were to ask how it is that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">commentary on Psalms 139,11: ולילה אור בעדני, “night will&nbsp;provide me with cover” understands the word אור as meaning&nbsp;darkness, the correct interpretation of these verses therefore&nbsp;must be that the word חשך, darkness, refers to the Egyptian&nbsp;side of the pillar of cloud, whereas the reference to light&nbsp;refers to the Israelites’ side of that pillar of cloud. The&nbsp;Targum’s translation confirms this interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאר את הלילה</span><span class="font5">, the pillar of fire that had been travelling ahead of the marching Israelites did not change its function,&nbsp;for if it had positioned itself behind the Israelites it would&nbsp;have provided light for the Egyptians. However, the pillar of&nbsp;cloud which had up until then disappeared at dusk every day,&nbsp;instead took up a position behind the Israelites. This&nbsp;prevented the Egyptians from coming closer to the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the meaning of the words: ולא קרב זה אל זה, “the one did not come closer to the other one,”&nbsp;does not refer to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">camps</span><span class="font5"> of the Israelites and the&nbsp;Egyptians, but to the pillar of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">cloud</span><span class="font5"> and the pillar of fire.&nbsp;(during the night) Once morning dawned, they merged with&nbsp;one another, however, as we will explain shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,21. ויבקעו המים</span><span class="font5">, “the waters split vertically right down to the bed of the sea.” In Moses’ song of thanksgiving, one&nbsp;half of a verse speaks of the waters “freezing solid,” קפאו&nbsp;15,8) ,תהומות) whereas the other half describes this as&nbsp;occurring בלב ים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">in the heart of the sea,” which appears to&nbsp;contradict the interpretation that the waters split vertically&nbsp;right to the bottom of the sea. We must understand that the&nbsp;sea at that point was flowing over its banks. (the sea in&nbsp;question was tongue-like, like a very wide river, say the&nbsp;Amazon river near its delta.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the sea had not split all the way down to the bottom the Israelites would have literally have had to descend to that&nbsp;bottom on one bank and to climb out of it afterwards again.&nbsp;Therefore the process described occurred in three stages, so&nbsp;that near each bank (shore) the waters froze horizontally to&nbsp;facilitate the Israelites’ descending and subsequent&nbsp;ascending on the opposite side. The waters formed vertical&nbsp;walls for the Israelites from either side. The simile of לב ים,&nbsp;“heart of the sea,” used by Moses illustrated this as the&nbsp;human heart in a certain manner divides the torso from the&nbsp;head and shoulders above and the lower part including the&nbsp;legs below. As a result of this division, the Israelites could&nbsp;cross without having to descend or to ascend at all. The&nbsp;waters after freezing and becoming dry, were level with the&nbsp;two shores. This is illustrated by the author of a liturgical&nbsp;poem recited in most synagogues in the morning prayer of&nbsp;the last day of Passover, (in the repetition of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">amidah</span><span class="font5"> on&nbsp;the quote: וברוח אפיך נערמו מים, commencing with the words:&nbsp;פנו כאן וכאן שליש רום מימות, “while one side of the highest&nbsp;waters reared themselves on each side the remainder&nbsp;became bound up to form a path for their footsteps.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Verses 19,20,21, each have 72 letters, each word starting a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the first and&nbsp;third verse has the first letter of each word in the normal&nbsp;sequence, whereas the second verse has as the first word&nbsp;the last letter of the alphabet proceeding in the reverse order.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has explained in his commentary on the Talmud in&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot,</span><span class="font5"> folio 45, on אנ׳י וה׳ו, how by reading the three&nbsp;verses when they are written one on top of the other in the&nbsp;order in which they appear in the Torah vertically when&nbsp;reading from the top down we get the 72 names of G’d (in a&nbsp;three lettered version each.) Moses employed these versions&nbsp;of the names of G’d as a means to split the sea. Seeing that&nbsp;at the beginning of this process Moses was mentioned in the&nbsp;Torah as initiating it, when we recite the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hoshaanot</span><span class="font5"> on the&nbsp;seventh day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font5"> when according to tradition the world’s&nbsp;water supply is determined in the heavenly regions. The&nbsp;second acronym is taken from the 37<sup>th</sup> word in the&nbsp;arrangement we discussed. We may learn from this mystical&nbsp;approach that the Torah credited both G’d and Moses with&nbsp;having had a share in this miracle. [Moses’ staff, and G’d’s&nbsp;East wind. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבאו בני ישראל בתוך הים</span><span class="font5">, “the Children of Israel&nbsp;went into the midst of the sea;” the Israelites did not cross&nbsp;the sea by using it as a convenient crossing on their way to&nbsp;the land of Canaan, as it is well known that there is no sea&nbsp;separating Egypt from the land of Canaan. The only reason&nbsp;they had to enter the sea at all, was to give G’d a chance to&nbsp;lure the Egyptians to their death through pursuing the&nbsp;Israelites. This is why they turned back from the desert of&nbsp;Eytam to the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בתוך הים</span><span class="font5">, “into the midst of the sea;” even if they set half a foot inside the water this is already called: בתוך הים. We&nbsp;know this from Numbers 11,4 when the Torah in describing&nbsp;the riffraff amongst the Israelites, of whom surely there were&nbsp;only very few, as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והאספסוף בתוך העם</span><span class="font5">, “the riffraff in the midst of&nbsp;the people.” Surely they had been at the fringe of the people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבאו אחריהם</span><span class="font5">, “they followed after them;” They&nbsp;might not have done so knowingly, but seeing that everything&nbsp;in front of them was darkness, they did not realise that they&nbsp;had done so until they were into what had been sea&nbsp;moments before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;באשמורת הבקר</span><span class="font5">, “during the morning watch;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">claims that seeing that the night is divided in accordance with&nbsp;the songs of the angels in heaven, these watches are called&nbsp;אשמורת. This word means “waiting for;” the angels have to be&nbsp;on time so as not to miss the turn allocated to them. We find&nbsp;the root שמר used in this context when Yaakov, hearing&nbsp;Joseph’s last dream is reported to have taken it seriously and&nbsp;he was waiting how that dream would play out. (Compare&nbsp;Genesis 37,11: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואביו שמר את הדבר</span><span class="font5">, “his father kept track of the&nbsp;matter.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באשמורת הבקר</span><span class="font5">, in our domain: “close to morning.” It was an hour when people already look forward towards morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעמוד אש וענן</span><span class="font5">, “through a pillar of fire and cloud;” the time when the pillar of fire made way for the pillar of cloud. At this&nbsp;brief moment the two phenomena appeared as if mixed up&nbsp;with one another in front of the camp of the Egyptians. The&nbsp;Egyptians had not been used to see a pillar of fire, they had&nbsp;only faced darkness up to that moment. As soon as they saw&nbsp;the pillar of fire they took fright and wanted to reverse&nbsp;direction in order to flee. The Israelites meanwhile had no&nbsp;need to stop, so that from that moment on they put more and&nbsp;more distance between themselves and their pursuers.&nbsp;Seeing that the frozen waters on both of their sides were&nbsp;security, they could proceed undisturbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסר</span><span class="font5">, “the Egyptian tried to remove;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אופן מרכבותיו</span><span class="font5">, “the wheel of his chariots;” the root יסר</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">is used here as in Judges 4,18 when the fleeing general Sisera of the Canaanites tried to find refuge in the tent of&nbsp;Yael. Here the Egyptians tried to reverse the wheels of their&nbsp;chariots but could not manage to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וינהגהו בכבדות</span><span class="font5">, “He forced them to move with difficulty;” the principal difficulty of turning around chariot was the&nbsp;chariot following which was in the way so that most forward&nbsp;chariot could not even turn around. Eventually, every chariot&nbsp;driver became a hindrance to his colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמר מצרים אנוסה</span><span class="font5">, Egypt’s commander now decided to flee on foot and to abandon the chariots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מפני בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “from the Children of Israel;” even this did not help them as we know from verse 26 where G’d ordered&nbsp;Moses to extend his hand over the sea, so that the frozen&nbsp;waters of the sea would revert to their normal state and&nbsp;drown the Egyptians in the process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לפנות בקר לאיתנו</span><span class="font5">, “when the morning had&nbsp;approached to becoming noon;” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B‘chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נסים לקראתו</span><span class="font5">, “fleeing toward it;” at the beginning the waters of the sea had frozen; when the Egyptians saw that&nbsp;the solidity of the water offered them a chance for escape&nbsp;they tried to use it as a route of escape seeing that climbing&nbsp;to the shore was too strenuous. When the waters started to&nbsp;melt, they realised that they had been fleeing in the direction&nbsp;of where the waves came from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.28. לא נשאר מהם עד אחד</span><span class="font5">, “not a single one of them remained alive.” This is what David recorded in Psalms&nbsp;106,11: אחד מהם לא נותר, “not a single one of them remained.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובני ישראל הלכו ביבשה, </span><span class="font5">“meanwhile the Children of&nbsp;Israel had walked on dry land.” This verse is inseparably&nbsp;linked to the previous one, as it contrasts the experiences of&nbsp;the Israelites and those of the Egyptians at one and the&nbsp;same time. If we had to explain this scientifically, we would&nbsp;say that two winds each blowing in opposite directions had&nbsp;been at work during that period. The wind described in&nbsp;Moses’ song in 15,8, served the interests of the Israelites,&nbsp;whereas the words: נשפת ברוחך, “You blew with Your wind,”&nbsp;served to lure the Egyptians to their destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויושע ה' ביום ההוא</span><span class="font5">, “on that day the Lord&nbsp;delivered;” this verse testifies to G’d’s having kept His&nbsp;promise of “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">'</span><span class="font5">התיצבו וראו את </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ישועת ה</span><span class="font5">, “stand firm and watch the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">deliverance</span><span class="font5"> orchestrated by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem!”</span><span class="font5"> This day was one of&nbsp;complete deliverance, as from that day on the Israelites did&nbsp;not see any more Egyptians in their lives [that generation.&nbsp;Ed.])</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את מצרים מת</span><span class="font5">, the Torah refers to all of them in the singular mode. We find other examples of this construction in&nbsp;the Holy Scriptures, the most recent one being in verse 10 of&nbsp;our chapter: והנה מצרים </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">נוסע</span><span class="font5"> אחריהם, “and here Egypt </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">was&nbsp;travelling</span><span class="font5"> behind them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על שפת הים, “</span><span class="font5">on the beach of the sea;” it is usual for the sea to disgorge its corpses on the beach; we know this from:&nbsp;Isaiah 57.20: ויגרשו מימיו רפש וטיט, “its waters tossed up mire&nbsp;and mud.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand this verse as being a condensation, the full text should have been: “the Israelites&nbsp;saw that on the beach of the sea Egyptians were dead from&nbsp;having drowned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,31. ובמשה עבדו</span><span class="font5">, “and in His servant Moses.” The Israelites now were full of respect for the quality of Moses’&nbsp;prophetic powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמרו לאמור</span><span class="font5">, literally: “they said to say;” a&nbsp;somewhat unusual construction, meaning that the Israelites&nbsp;singing this song meant for </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">future</span><span class="font5"> generations to learn it by&nbsp;heart and to recite it on appropriate occasions. [As we still do&nbsp;in our daily morning prayers. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עזי וזמרת י-ה</span><span class="font5">, “my victory and my song is G’d;”&nbsp;(Onkelos) according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the vocalisation of the word&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ozzi</span><span class="font5"> here is most unusual as it should have been </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">uzzi. Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">examined this song grammatically in great detail; [seeing that&nbsp;it is poetry and you my readers are mostly not experts in&nbsp;classical Hebrew grammar (neither is this editor), I omit most&nbsp;of these comments. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהי לי לישועה</span><span class="font5">, “He became my salvation.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that the expression ויהי should not raise any questions&nbsp;although we might have expected the word היה here for the&nbsp;past tense. He points out that we find similar constructions in&nbsp;Chronicles II 10,17, where we read about the kingdom of&nbsp;Yehudah having “appointed” Solomon’s son Rechavam as&nbsp;their king, and the word: וימלוך is used by the author,&nbsp;although the meaning is that Rechavam would </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">continue</span><span class="font5"> to&nbsp;rule over the tribes of Yehudah and Binyamin as he had&nbsp;already been doing since his father Solomon had died and&nbsp;the country had not been split through the revolution which&nbsp;brought Jerovam to the throne of the ten remaining tribes. An&nbsp;almost identical verse is also found in Kings I 12,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זה א-לי</span><span class="font5">, “this is my G’d.” Moses refers to G’d with the word, “זה,” “this,” although G’d, is, of course, invisible, This&nbsp;maybe the reason why we find Moses described on occasion&nbsp;as &quot;זה משה האיש,” [when after an absence on Mount Sinai of&nbsp;40 days he had still not become visible again. (Compare&nbsp;Exodus 32,1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,3. איש מלחמה, </span><span class="font5">“a Man of war.” He acquired that title&nbsp;after having drowned His adversaries, the chariots of&nbsp;Pharaoh and their derivers, in the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תהומות יכסיומו</span><span class="font5">, “the deeps covered them;” the letter&nbsp;מ in the word יכסיומו should have had the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cholem</span><span class="font5"> as&nbsp;have similar formulations of a verse, instead of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shuruk&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">which our sages decided. The reason they did so was that&nbsp;there was already a vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shuruk</span><span class="font5"> immediately in front of it.&nbsp;We find a similar example of this dilemma in Ezekiel 43,11, in&nbsp;the word: ומבואיו.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נאדרי</span><span class="font5">, “glorious;” this adjective refers to G’d, the&nbsp;letter י at the end is superfluous, just as the letter י in Psalms&nbsp;123,1 is superfluous in the word: היושבי. We therefore&nbsp;understand the whole sentence as if the Torah had written:&nbsp;ימינך ה' הנאדר בכח היא תרעץ אויב, “Your right hand o Lord, is the&nbsp;one that shatters the foe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.7. תהרוס קמיך</span><span class="font5">, “You break Your opponents.” This verb&nbsp;describes some kind of motion, stampeding, as in Exodus&nbsp;19,21: פן יהרסו אל ה' לראות “lest they come stampeding in&nbsp;order to get a glimpse of G’d.” Compare also Isaiah 22,19:&nbsp;ויהרסו ממצבך, “and He will destroy you by crushing you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נערמו מים</span><span class="font5">, “the waters rose up (like wall);” Onkelos&nbsp;translates these words as “חכימו מים,” the waters acted&nbsp;wisely, etc;” We understand this as the waters co-operating&nbsp;with G’d’s plan to pour the Egyptians into the water. This&nbsp;would conform with what we have read in Deuteronomy 11,4:&nbsp;אשר הציף ה' את מי ים סוף על פניהם ברדפם אחריכם, “how the Lord&nbsp;rolled back upon them the waters of the sea of reeds when&nbsp;they were pursuing you; i.e. the waters were pursuing the&nbsp;Egyptians.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,9. 'אמר אויב וגו</span><span class="font5">, “the enemy had said, etc.; ”when he saw that the sea had had turned into a dry surface through&nbsp;the waves having frozen in the heart of it, the enemy&nbsp;considered this as an opportunity to catch up faster with the&nbsp;Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אריק חרבי</span><span class="font5">, “I will bare My sword;” our author feels that the letter ב before the word חרבי is missing here, and he&nbsp;quotes similar instances, so that as a result, the line would&nbsp;mean that by using His sword G’d separates body from soul;&nbsp;and blood from breathing; [personally I had no problem with&nbsp;the word חרבי as is. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תורישמו ידי</span><span class="font5">, “My hand shall destroy them;” the root of the word is ירש, so that the meaning in our verse is “Will disinherit&nbsp;them in favour of My people”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,10 כעופרת</span><span class="font5">, “like lead.” The word is a derivative of עפר “earth.” Whereas the other six types of metal, if buried in the&nbsp;earth will gradually diminish in weight and substance, lead&nbsp;retains its composition and does not deteriorate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,11. מי כמוכה באלם</span><span class="font5">, “Who is like you among deities?” the letter י is missing in the word אלים. It is a hint of the&nbsp;inability of any so-called deities to even use the power of&nbsp;speech that ordinary human beings possess. They are totally&nbsp;dumb. Moses uses it here slightly differently by hinting that&nbsp;only our G’d can remain absolutely silent even when&nbsp;provoked. This degree of self-control is found nowhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נורא תהלות</span><span class="font5">, “awesome in splendour.” It is the multiplicity of praises that make the Lord so awesome. We find the&nbsp;expression נורא applied to objects which possess more than&nbsp;the virtues or qualities required for them to live up to their&nbsp;reputations. For instance: המדבר הגדול והנורא הוא</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">that great&nbsp;and awesome desert.” (Deuteronomy 1 19.) Or, Maleachi&nbsp;3,23: לפני בא יום ה' הגדול והנורא</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">before the arrival of that great&nbsp;and awesome day.”: [The author quotes more examples. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עושה פלא</span><span class="font5">, “working wonders.!” It is well known that air exhaled through the nose is warm or even hot. It could even&nbsp;be hot enough to cause substances with a low melting point&nbsp;to melt. When G’d was described as exhaling hot air from&nbsp;angry nostrils, the result was that the waters of the sea piled&nbsp;up as blocks of ice instead. On the other hand, when G’d&nbsp;blew forth air from the mouth, these blocks of ice melted&nbsp;instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נטית ימינך</span><span class="font5">, “You inclined Your right hand;” a&nbsp;reference to chapter 14,26 when G’d instructed Moses to&nbsp;extend his arm so that the waters would return to normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עם זו</span><span class="font5">, “this nation;” Whenever the expression זו is&nbsp;used it means the same as אשר, “that one,” or “which;”&nbsp;compare Isaiah 42,24. It follows that in our verse, the words&nbsp;עם זו גאלת</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">mean: “You have redeemed a nation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל נוה קדשך</span><span class="font5">, the entire land of Israel is called: “G’d’s holy residence.” As an example of this statement our author cites:&nbsp;Psalms 78,54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ויביאם אל גבול קדשו הר זה קנתה ימינה, “He brought them to the land of His holiness His right hand acquired this&nbsp;mountain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נחית, </span><span class="font5">“you guided;” both this word and the word נהלת, are to be understood as in the future tense, as Moses is&nbsp;predicting something that had not happened yet. This is very&nbsp;common use of language when prophecies or poems are&nbsp;involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;חיל אחז יושבי פלשת</span><span class="font5">, “fear gripped the inhabitants of&nbsp;Palestine.” They were afraid that retribution for their having&nbsp;killed tens of thousands of the members of the tribe of&nbsp;Ephrayim was at hand. Those members of the tribe of&nbsp;Ephrayim had been trying to leapfrog the appointed time of&nbsp;the end of Jewish slavery. They had been killed by the&nbsp;inhabitants of Gat, who had been born in the land of the&nbsp;Philistines. (Compare Chronicles I 7,21.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אז נבהלו אלופי אדום</span><span class="font5">, “then the chieftains of Edom&nbsp;were frightened.” They thought that they would now be&nbsp;punished for their founder Esau’s wrongful hatred of his twin&nbsp;brother Yaakov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נמוגו כל יושבי כנען</span><span class="font5">, “all the inhabitants of Canaan’s hearts melted away.” They were certain that the time when the&nbsp;Israelites would drive them out of their homes was at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They were aware of the prophecy recorded in Exodus 3,8 that the Jewish G’d would descend from heaven in order to&nbsp;redeem His people, and drive out the Canaanites from their&nbsp;land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תפול עליהם אימה ופחד</span><span class="font5">, “may fear and terror&nbsp;descend upon them;” this is a prayer by Moses. He prays&nbsp;that they should continue to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">remain</span><span class="font5"> in this state of terror. The&nbsp;root נפל is used here in the same sense as when the Torah&nbsp;described the death of Yishmael in Genesis 25,18 with the&nbsp;words: על פני כל אחיו נפל, “he had fallen in the presence of all&nbsp;his brothers.” [If I understand our author correctly, he&nbsp;interprets Yishmael’s death as not that of a mighty hunter or&nbsp;hero, but as a person who was desperately afraid of death at&nbsp;the time. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בגדול זרועך</span><span class="font5">, “through the might of Your arm;” this means the same as if the Torah had written: בזרוע גדלך, “with the arm&nbsp;of Your greatness.” We find a similar inverted expression of&nbsp;adjective and noun in Psalms 65,5: קדוש היכלך, which&nbsp;normally would be expressed as היכלך הקדוש, “Your holy&nbsp;Temple.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד יעבור עם זו קנית</span><span class="font5">, “until this people which You acquired as Your own through having taken them out of bondage from&nbsp;Egypt,” in order to bring them and implant them firmly in the&nbsp;mountain of Your heritage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תביאמו ותטעמו</span><span class="font5">, “You will bring it and plant it;”&nbsp;these words belong to the words: עם זו קנית, “You have&nbsp;acquired this nation,” from the previous verse. Another&nbsp;example where words in one verse belong to the previous&nbsp;verse is found in Psalms 5,12: וישמחו כל חוסי בך לעולם ירננו ותסך&nbsp;עלימו; “and let all who take refuge in You rejoice; ever jubilant&nbsp;as You shelter them.” That verse too is actually part of the&nbsp;verse preceding it, contrasting it with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תביאמו ותטעמו</span><span class="font5">; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the fact that Moses spoke </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> about G’d doing this, is equivalent to a prophecy&nbsp;that he would not live to see his people entering the land </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Israel. Otherwise he would have used the first person plural&nbsp;mode of: ”us.” If you were to argue that this is not news as&nbsp;we could have learned this from Exodus 6,1 where G’d had&nbsp;told Moses what he would experience, i.e. “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font5"> you will see&nbsp;what I shall do to Pharaoh, which some commentators&nbsp;interpret as Moses being told that he would not experience&nbsp;what G’d would do for the people when He would defeat the&nbsp;Canaanites. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> did not understand that verse in that&nbsp;sense, saying that this was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">our</span><span class="font5"> interpretation, but was not&nbsp;what G’d had meant to convey to Moses. Proof that Moses&nbsp;had not understood himself as being excluded is found in&nbsp;Numbers 10,29, when he says to his father-in-law Yitro:&nbsp;נוסעים </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אנחנו</span><span class="font5"> אל המקום אשר אמר ה' אותו אתן לכם, “we are about to&nbsp;journey to the place of which G’d has said: ‘I will give it to&nbsp;you.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותטעמו</span><span class="font5">, “You will plant it;” the verb נטע meaning to plant, is always used with a plant that will endure for a long period.&nbsp;[Our author quotes Ezekiel 17,23, as proof although there the&nbsp;verb שתל is used? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'מקדש ה</span><span class="font5">, the name for G’d used in the spelling here is the one with the letters א-ד.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,18. ה׳ ימלוך לעולם ועדת</span><span class="font5">, ‘the Lord will rule forever;” a prayer, meaning: “may it be Your will that the Lord Who rules&nbsp;over us now will continue to do so forever, and may He&nbsp;continue to do favours for us similar to the ones He just did.”&nbsp;Although at first glance the word: ימלוך may be&nbsp;misunderstood a it is in the future tense, it is used as a&nbsp;present tense. One of many such examples is found in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 32,11: כנשר יעיר קנו ירחף, “as an eagle that stirs&nbsp;up its nest hovering over its young.” The verse continues in&nbsp;the future tense but describes matters that occur all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעולם ועד</span><span class="font5">; this is an abbreviated version of the expression: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעולם ועד עולם</span><span class="font5">, “from one world until the next&nbsp;world.” There is no reason to wonder that the word ועד does&nbsp;not appear in the construct mode, as we find more such&nbsp;examples, such as in Isaiah 57,15: שוכן עד מרום וקדוש שמו,&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">forever</span><span class="font5"> dwells the One Whose name is high and holy;” the&nbsp;meaning of the line is: His name will remain forever exalted&nbsp;and holy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The author explains that it is a peculiarity of classical Hebrew that the emphasis is placed on the letter following&nbsp;the prefix ו, in other words, on the letter ע in the word ועד. He&nbsp;cites Leviticus 7,23-שור וכשב ועז as an example, as well as</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Genesis 3,13: הנחש השיאני </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ואכל</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“the serpent seduced me and I ate,” as another example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי בא סוס פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “when Pharaoh’s horse entered&nbsp;the sea and G’d brought back the waters of the sea upon&nbsp;them, while the Israelites continued to walk on a completely&nbsp;dry sea bed, Miriam, the prophetess, sister of Aaron, took her&nbsp;drum and began to sing a song of thanksgiving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מרים הנביאה</span><span class="font5">, “Miriam the prophetess;” the word&nbsp;“prophetess” is used here to describe Miriam’s extraordinary&nbsp;ability to use words to express her feelings. According to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam,</span><span class="font5"> the word is also used as describing someone&nbsp;who preaches to people to behave morally and ethically&nbsp;correctly. Compare when G’d told Moses that his brother&nbsp;Aaron would be נביאך, which can hardly mean: “your prophet,”&nbsp;as Moses outclassed him in that department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שירו לה' כי גאה</span><span class="font5">, “raise your voices in song to the&nbsp;Lord, for He has been triumphant;” the women sang the&nbsp;whole of Moses’ song, word by word; seeing that the text had&nbsp;already been recorded, the Torah does not need to repeat all&nbsp;of it and mentions only the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שלשת ימים במדבר</span><span class="font5">, “for three days in the desert.”&nbsp;They camped three times, at Eytam, Pi-hachirot, and Marah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.25. ויורהו ה׳ עץ וישלך אל המים</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord taught him about a certain kind of wood, and he tossed it into the water;”&nbsp;although G’d had other means of making the water sweet,&nbsp;without using that kind of wood, G’d wanted to teach Moses&nbsp;some common chemistry, i.e. how to use natural products to&nbsp;sweeten something that only needs sweetening in order to&nbsp;make it drinkable or edible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שם שם לו חק ומשפט</span><span class="font5">, “there He made for them a statute and an ordinance; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> one of them was the&nbsp;law of the red heifer, although in practice it could not be&nbsp;practiced until the second year of their wanderings. [There is&nbsp;no earlier source for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> saying that this law was&nbsp;revealed at Marah. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר</span><span class="font5">, “he said;” the subject is Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'אם שמוע תשמע וגו</span><span class="font5">, “if you will surely listen etc.;” Moses quotes what G’d had said to him to tell the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'כל המחלה אשר שמתי במצרים וגו</span><span class="font5">, “every disease with which I have afflicted the Egyptians in Egypt, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לקול ה' אלוקיך</span><span class="font5">, the letter ל in the word לקול, has a “crown”. [something exceptional for that letter. Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא אשים עליך</span><span class="font5">, “I will not afflict you with.” G’d implied that the reason He would not do so is that He would otherwise&nbsp;have to trouble Himself to cure the Israelites from these&nbsp;diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אני ה' רופאיך</span><span class="font5">, “for I, the Lord, am your physician.” I would have to act as your physician after you had decided to&nbsp;listen to My voice, having been afflicted with such diseases&nbsp;as I struck the Egyptians with. [If understand our author&nbsp;correctly, he means that these diseases would not be&nbsp;considered as “natural,” as the Israelites had learned while in&nbsp;Egypt that they were means of G’d punishing people as&nbsp;opposed to diseases that had not been inflicted upon the&nbsp;Egyptians. Ed.] G’d hints that no physician but He could have&nbsp;turned water into blood and reversed the process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,27. ויחנו שם</span><span class="font5">, “they encamped there.” The reason why&nbsp;they did so was to devote time to study the laws G’d had&nbsp;taught them, as we read about in verse 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,1. ויבאו כל עדת בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “the entire community of Israel arrived, etc.” the unusual formulation is meant to&nbsp;emphasise that since the departure from Egypt until this point&nbsp;not a single Israelite who had left Egypt was found missing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בחמשה עשר יום לחודש השני </span><span class="font5">“on the fifteenth day of the second month.” We had learned already that the first day of&nbsp;the month of Nissan during which the people left Egypt had&nbsp;occurred on a Thursday. It follows that the 15<sup>th</sup> day of Iyar the&nbsp;day on which they arrived at the desert of Sin must have&nbsp;been a Sabbath. They used this fact to complain to Moses by&nbsp;wishing they had rather died in Egypt than have had to face&nbsp;the problems they had to contend with [since having become&nbsp;a “free” people. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses reassured them that as soon as the Sabbath was over they would be provided with meat to eat, and that&nbsp;on the following morning they would be given manna. [It had&nbsp;been the day on which the dough/matzot they had taken with&nbsp;them had run out. Ed.] The Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 87,&nbsp;states that they had left </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refidim</span><span class="font5"> on a Sabbath, even though&nbsp;they had been given the basic laws of the Sabbath at Marah.&nbsp;[One opinion there claims that the restriction of travelling&nbsp;more than 2000 cubits on the Sabbath away from an&nbsp;inhabited area, was not yet applicable. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וילינו כל עדת</span><span class="font5">, “the entire community complained;”&nbsp;the word: וילינו while written with the letter י after the letter ל is&nbsp;read as if that letter י had been the letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ו.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מותנו ביד ה, </span><span class="font5">“if we had died directly as an act of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem;”</span><span class="font5"> they meant that they rather would have died at&nbsp;their appointed time, instead of having had their lives cut&nbsp;short through dying from starvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בשבתנו על סיר בשר, </span><span class="font5">“when we had been sitting besides a pot of meat.” They did not imply that they actually had meat&nbsp;in Egypt, but that they had adequate food. Another example&nbsp;of where לחם does not literally mean “bread,” but a meal, is&nbsp;found in Genesis 3,25. The same is true for the expression</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">סיר בשר.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.4. לחם מן השמים</span><span class="font5">, “bread originating in the celestial regions.” The word שמים, both here and in numerous other&nbsp;instances describes any region in the universe inaccessible&nbsp;to human beings. The expression שמים, “heaven,” is used to&nbsp;remind the people daily that their needs will be met from&nbsp;heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולקטו דבר יום ביומו, </span><span class="font5">“which they will collect on a daily basis;” if you were to ask why would they not get a large&nbsp;supply all at one time, instead of having to collect it on a daily&nbsp;basis, G’d immediately answers this question before it could&nbsp;even be raised: למען אנסנו הילך בתורותי אם לא, “if the people will&nbsp;live according to My teachings or not. To this end, I will&nbsp;command them not to keep in storage any of the daily&nbsp;quantity of manna overnight, and I will let it go rotten, in order&nbsp;to teach them to have faith that I will supply an additional&nbsp;amount on the next day. Anyone following My instructions&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font5"> to save any of it for the following day will be considered&nbsp;by Me as having displayed no his faith in Me. A person who&nbsp;has enough to eat for one day, and is worried about the&nbsp;morrow, is considered by Me as having displayed lack of&nbsp;faith in Me. The Israelites have to learn that He Who created&nbsp;the universe also has created the means for His creatures in&nbsp;it to remain alive and well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למען אנסנו</span><span class="font5">, “in order that I may test etc.” As far as the Lord is concerned there is no such thing as testing for a&nbsp;result, since being omniscient He knows all the results&nbsp;beforehand. Whenever the Torah uses this terminology it is&nbsp;to be understood as G’d satisfying the attribute of Justice that&nbsp;what He is about to do is justified in response to an&nbsp;accusation by that attribute against the individual to be&nbsp;tested. Alternately, He uses that means in order to justify&nbsp;denial of a demand for mercy by the attribute of Mercy on&nbsp;behalf of a certain individual when in G’d’s opinion that&nbsp;attribute had exceeded the function allotted to it. [The author&nbsp;has explained this already in his commentary of G’d ”testing&nbsp;Avraham” before the binding of Yitzchok. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצא העם ולקטו...והיה ביום השישי...והיה משנה</span><span class="font5">, The people</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">went out and collected;...... and it was on the sixth day.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and there was an amount twice as much as regular; these verses are not part of the commandment, but G’d had told&nbsp;Moses: I shall do such and such, and they will do such and&nbsp;such. The following will occur, i.e. they will find that each had&nbsp;collected an amount appropriate for the requisite needs of&nbsp;the number of members of his family. It happened that on the&nbsp;sixth day the leaders of the people came to Moses to find out&nbsp;why they had each received a double daily portion of manna,&nbsp;although they had only expected to collect the regular&nbsp;amount, not intending to take to their tents more than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,5. והכינו את אשר יביאו</span><span class="font5">, “let them prepare (for the morrow) that which they shall bring home. The word והכינו&nbsp;does not only mean: “to prepare,” but also to conceal after&nbsp;having prepared something for presenting it at a later date.&nbsp;We find this expression in Genesis 37,25, when the brothers&nbsp;of Joseph, already in his private residence after having been&nbsp;invited for lunch, arranged the gift they had brought with&nbsp;them from their father before revealing it when he came into&nbsp;the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,6. ערב וידעתם</span><span class="font5">, “by evening you will know; and in the morning you will see;” this sounds somewhat inverted as&nbsp;usually you see something before you know it. Actually, G’d&nbsp;is simply saying that they will see and become conscious of&nbsp;both blessings, meat and bread. We find a similar inverted&nbsp;construction in Zecharyah 9,17: דגן בחורים ותירוש ינובב בתולות,&nbsp;“producing young men like grain, young women like new&nbsp;wine.” The meaning of that verse is: “G’d will enable the&nbsp;young men and virgins to be receiving blessings appropriate&nbsp;to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> genders, instead of each sex receiving only what it&nbsp;had hoped to receive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.7. כי תלונו, </span><span class="font5">this word (on this occasion as opposed to&nbsp;verse 2) is spelled with the letter ו in the middle, whereas it is&nbsp;read as if that letter had been a י.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר משה: בתת ה' לכם</span><span class="font5">, “Moses said: “when </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">gives you, etc.” this refers to an announcement he had&nbsp;already commenced with in verse 6, but these words have&nbsp;been repeated here as the announcement is longer than&nbsp;usual. The whole announcement is: “in the evening you will&nbsp;know when the Lord will give you meat to eat and in the&nbsp;morning you will see when He gives you bread to satisfy&nbsp;yourselves with, that your complaints should not have been&nbsp;directed at us when you accused us being to blame for your&nbsp;deprivations by saying that we had taken you out of Egypt.&nbsp;You will become aware that your deprivations were caused&nbsp;by G’d and taken care of by Him to teach you several&nbsp;lessons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses reminded the people that when a person has a complaint against a master, he dares not blame the master&nbsp;to his face, but prefers to blame his servant instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,11. וידבר ה' אל משה</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hashem</span><span class="font5"> spoke to Moses; actually we have been told this already in verse 4. [This may&nbsp;have been repeated as Moses and Aaron had not&nbsp;immediately included what G’d had said concerning the&nbsp;manna on Friday being a double portion. Therefore here we&nbsp;have a stronger command, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> being quoted as וידבר&nbsp;instead of the softer ויאמר, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'בין הערבים תאכלו בשר וגו</span><span class="font5">, from this verse we learn&nbsp;that basically, the Israelites were to eat a meal twice daily, in&nbsp;the evening and on the morning following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותעל השלו</span><span class="font5">, “the quail appeared;” the gift of quails&nbsp;was a one time occurrence, which explains the people’s&nbsp;complaint in Numbers 11,4 where they craved meat. On that&nbsp;occasion G’d provided them with meat a second time as&nbsp;stated in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Erchin</span><span class="font5"> folio 15. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> writes that the&nbsp;demand by the people for meat in their diet described in&nbsp;Numbers was more insistent. The manna was provided by&nbsp;G’d daily for forty years. [After the disastrous results of many&nbsp;people dying from overeating on meat in the second year of&nbsp;their wanderings, and dying as a result, we never hear of&nbsp;such a request again. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותעל שכבת טל, </span><span class="font5">“when the daily layer of dew lifted,&nbsp;there was left a flaky substance on the surface of the desert.”&nbsp;The words: ותעל שכבת הטל, are interrupted here to prepare us&nbsp;for what follows. We encounter a similar construction in&nbsp;Psalms 102,25: אל תעלני בחצי ימי, “Do not take me away in the&nbsp;midst of my days.” The words: שכבת הטל, (especially with the&nbsp;prefix ה indicating that the dew was a well known&nbsp;phenomenon,) refer to the daily descent previously of that&nbsp;layer of dew; we have a similar construction in Job 38,37:&nbsp;ונבלי שמים מי ישכיב, “who can tilt the “bottles” of the sky?” (a&nbsp;hint at the phenomenon of dew) The root שכב, “to come to&nbsp;rest in a prone condition,” is used in both these verses. (Ibn&nbsp;Era)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מן הוא</span><span class="font5">, in the Egyptian language this word is&nbsp;equivalent to the Hebrew: מה, “what?” People were asking&nbsp;one another about the nature of this layer of a flaky&nbsp;substance above the layer of dew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'זה הדבר אשר צוה ה</span><span class="font5">, “this is the subject concerning&nbsp;which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> has commanded: “collect some of it!” We&nbsp;must not misunderstand this verse as a commandment to&nbsp;collect ail the manna. We know from what follows that each&nbsp;person-regardless of how much he thought he had collected-had collected only one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer</span><span class="font5"> per family member. This is why&nbsp;the Torah could report that the people had fulfilled this&nbsp;command with the words: ויעשו כן בני ישראל, “the Children of&nbsp;Israel did so. The so-called commandment was to be an&nbsp;ongoing commandment valid as long as the manna&nbsp;descended from the celestial regions on a regular basis. The&nbsp;ongoing miracle, in addition to being “heavenly bread,” was&nbsp;that it was meant to be לשובע, “to eat enough to be satiated,”&nbsp;not to gorge oneself. Therefore, even an Israelite who&nbsp;thought that he had collected two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omers,</span><span class="font5"> upon returning to&nbsp;his tent found that he had collected only one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer.</span><span class="font5"> The word&nbsp;צוה here is to be understood just as the word צוה in Psalms&nbsp;33,9: הוא צוה ויעמוד, “He commanded and it endured.” In other&nbsp;words, the commandment in question had no time limit&nbsp;attached to it. It applied equally in the reverse; if someone&nbsp;had intended to collect only half an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer,</span><span class="font5"> and was sure that&nbsp;he had done so, upon measuring it after he came home, he&nbsp;found that he had in fact collected a whole </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,18 ולא העדיף המרבה</span><span class="font5">, “these words have to be taken at their face value, i.e. if someone found that he had collected&nbsp;more than an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer</span><span class="font5"> he would throw out the excess, and if&nbsp;someone found he had collected less, he went back to&nbsp;gather the balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,19. אל יותר</span><span class="font5">, “do not leave any over!” The word יותר is&nbsp;word is to be understood as if it had been spelled in the&nbsp;transitive mode אל </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">יותיר</span><span class="font5">. We have other examples of such a&nbsp;formulation, as in Genesis 24,53, where Avraham’s servant&nbsp;Eliezer is described as taking jewelry out of his pocket or&nbsp;luggage, to give to Rivkah, and instead of the Torah writing:&nbsp;ויוציא העבד, it wrote: ויוצא העבד, “which literally translated&nbsp;would mean ”he went out,“ instead of “he took out.” These&nbsp;formulations of the root יצא also occur in the opposite&nbsp;direction as in Psalms 105,43: “He led His people out in&nbsp;gladness, “מוצא רוח מאוצרותיו ויוציא עמו בששון,“ or in Psalms&nbsp;135 7: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מוצא רוח מאורותיו</span><span class="font5">, “He releases the wind from His&nbsp;vaults.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,21 וילקטו אותו בבקר בבקר</span><span class="font5">, “they collected it morning after morning.” They rose to collect the manna before it&nbsp;started melting when the sun became hot. At that time it was&nbsp;impossible to collect it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לחם משנה</span><span class="font5">, from the expression לחם משנה we can&nbsp;deduce that each person unwittingly collected two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omers.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Seeing that this is so, why did the Torah have to add the&nbsp;words: “two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omers</span><span class="font5"> for each person?” The reason is that the&nbsp;second portion of manna collected on that day was destined&nbsp;especially for consumption on the Sabbath, and that is the&nbsp;reason why the letter ל at the beginning of the word לכם has&nbsp;the full vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz</span><span class="font5"> under it instead of the semi-vowel&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’vah</span><span class="font5"> which we would have expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויגידו</span><span class="font5">, “They told;” the people told Moses about this phenomenon as they were afraid that if they were to hide the&nbsp;extra portion until the following morning he would become&nbsp;angry at them, as he had already previously been angry at&nbsp;any of the people who had saved some manna overnight&nbsp;against his warning not to do so. He had not informed them&nbsp;beforehand about the rules governing the manna on the&nbsp;Sabbath in order that they should not go out on the Sabbath&nbsp;eve to collect one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer</span><span class="font5"> only to find that they had come with&nbsp;two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omers</span><span class="font5"> each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'הוא אשר דבר ה</span><span class="font5">, “this is precisely what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">had said;” Moses refers to what we have read in verse 5 that&nbsp;the people on the Sabbath eve were to prepare the manna in&nbsp;anticipation of eating it on he Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת כל העודף</span><span class="font5">, “and any excess of the regular amount of manna” was intended for the two meals to be consumed on&nbsp;the Sabbath. It was not to be consumed on the night that had&nbsp;already passed. G’d had decreed especially that contrary to&nbsp;what had occurred during the week days, the excess had not&nbsp;become smelly and unfit to eat and worm ridden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,26. וביום השביעי שבת</span><span class="font5">, “and the seventh day is to be a day of rest called Sabbath; the people who were lacking in&nbsp;faith however, were saying that Friday and the following night&nbsp;were called Sabbath; the proof that this is what they thought&nbsp;is that when Moses upbraided them he says to them: “it is&nbsp;Sabbath </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">today;”</span><span class="font5"> the emphasis on the word: “today” is meant&nbsp;as opposed to yesterday and last night. He had also told&nbsp;them on Friday: “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">tomorrow</span><span class="font5"> is the holy day Sabbath you will&nbsp;not find any.” (verse 23) The people who believed that the&nbsp;night follows the day in the Jewish calendar had been wrong&nbsp;all along, as Moses had made plain from the way he&nbsp;described the law concerning the eating of matzo on the&nbsp;Passover festival, that it would be from the evening of the&nbsp;14/15<sup>th</sup> of Nissan until the 21<sup>st</sup> day of the month. In addition&nbsp;he had said to them in Leviticus 23,32 that the Day of&nbsp;Atonement commences on the evening and lasts until the&nbsp;following evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי ביום השביעי</span><span class="font5">, “it was on the seventh </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">day;</span><span class="font5">” the&nbsp;seventh day after the manna had descended for the first&nbsp;time. This was a Sabbath (counting from when the Israelites&nbsp;had been given a lunar calendar on the first day of Nissan)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יצאו מן העם ללקוט</span><span class="font5">, “some of the people left the camp intending to gather in manna;” they desecrated the Sabbath&nbsp;by doing so because they took their containers with them.&nbsp;They had already been told that this day was the day of the&nbsp;Sabbath when Moses had told them: “tomorrow is a holy day&nbsp;to G’d.” (verse 23)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מצותי</span><span class="font5">, “My commandments;” a) they had left over&nbsp;manna for the following day;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">b) ותורותי, “and My teachings;” they had been given the reason why the Sabbath was to be a day of rest. An example&nbsp;of the use of the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah</span><span class="font5"> meaning “teachings,” is found in&nbsp;Exodus 18,16: והודעתי את חוקי האלוקים ואת תורותיו, “and I will&nbsp;make known the laws and teachings of G’d.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל יצא איש ממקומו</span><span class="font5">, “None is to leave his place on&nbsp;the seventh day.” There is no need for anyone to leave his&nbsp;home in order to seek his sustenance as I have provided it&nbsp;already yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישבתו העם ביום השביעי</span><span class="font5">, “the people remained&nbsp;inactive on the seventh day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.31. ויקראו שמו </span><span class="font5">״</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן</span><span class="font5">״, “they named it “manna.” The reason was that the first time when they had put it into their&nbsp;mouth they had asked one another: מן הוא. (Exodus 16,15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By naming it thus they meant to say that their first reaction to it at the time had been justified, seeing that it was something&nbsp;no one had ever seen or tasted. Since that time the meaning&nbsp;of that word has been: “preparing food,” as in Daniel 1,5: וימן&nbsp;להם המלך דבר יום ביומו, “the King prepared food for them on a&nbsp;daily basis;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא כזרע גד</span><span class="font5">, “it was similar to coriander seed;” the Torah had described it in verse 14 as being thin like hoary frost; the&nbsp;frost referred to is distinct by not having definite dimensions,&nbsp;sometimes it is a thicker layer than at other times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא כזרע גד</span><span class="font5">, “and it is like coriander seed;” seeing that the Torah had previously described the manna as also being&nbsp;thin, in varying degrees, it wished to compare it also to&nbsp;something else, so that the reader who has never seen it,&nbsp;and is unlikely to ever see it, can get a better mental image&nbsp;of it. It was like the seed of a plant known as coriander. This&nbsp;plant is better known as cilantro (Spanish).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כזרע</span><span class="font5">, the letter כ has the semi-vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va,</span><span class="font5"> and the letter ז is vocalised with a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטעמו כצפיחית בדבש</span><span class="font5">, its taste resembled a wafer smeared with honey, i.e. it is eaten without further preparation. When&nbsp;we read elsewhere in Numbers 11,8 that its taste was like&nbsp;sweet cake with cream, that described its taste </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> it had&nbsp;been ground and baked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,35. אל ארץ נושבת</span><span class="font5">, to a land that was inhabited, as opposed to a desert. Compare Deuteronomy 12,7: ועברתם את&nbsp;הירדן </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">וישבתם</span><span class="font5"> בארץ וגו'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">as soon as you cross the river Jordan&nbsp;you will dwell in a land, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והעומר</span><span class="font5">, “and the amount known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer,</span><span class="font5"> etc;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עשירת האיפה הוא, </span><span class="font5">is equivalent to the well known measure </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eypha,</span><span class="font5"> a measure used for measuring grain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,1. ממדבר סין למסעיהם</span><span class="font5">, from the desert of Sin on their journeys; the Torah used an abbreviation here. The truth, as&nbsp;described in Numbers 33,12-14, is that the way stations after&nbsp;the desert of Sin were: Dofkah, Alush, and Refidim, at which&nbsp;point they found themselves short of water. The reason why&nbsp;two way-stations are omitted here is because of the disgrace&nbsp;of Israel who had wished to return to Egypt by the shortest&nbsp;possible route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,2. תנו לנו מי</span><span class="font5">ם, “give us water!” although Aaron had not been mentioned in this paragraph at all, the people used&nbsp;the plural mode when addressing Moses, although there had&nbsp;been no need to mention him at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מה תריבון מה תנסון</span><span class="font5">, “Why do you quarrel? Why do you try the Lord?” Both of these words are spelled without the letter&nbsp;ו. [not in our versions of the Torah scrolls or the printed&nbsp;versions. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Minchas shay</span><span class="font5"> quotes our author as the source of&nbsp;the above, without commenting. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וקח אתך מזקני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “and take with you some of the&nbsp;elders of Israel.” They were to be witnesses to the miracle&nbsp;that was to occur when, in response to Moses hitting the&nbsp;rock, a supply of water would materialise. The presence of&nbsp;these elders would prevent the people from claiming that the&nbsp;location (near Sinai) from which this water originated was&nbsp;one where fountains of water were located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר הכית בו את היאור, “</span><span class="font5">with which you had struck the river Nile;” [and turned its water into blood. Ed.] Moses was&nbsp;to demonstrate that his staff was not only an instrument with&nbsp;which to produce harmful effects. Actually, it had not been&nbsp;Moses who had struck the Nile but Aaron. (Exodus 7,19) The&nbsp;fact is that whatever Aaron did in Egypt, he did as the&nbsp;disciple of his master, Moses. This time, instead of denying&nbsp;water through his staff, he </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">produced</span><span class="font5"> water by means of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בחורב, והכית בצור, </span><span class="font5">although the people were&nbsp;encamped at Refidim, Moses went all the way to Mount Sinai&nbsp;to produce water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,8. ויבא עמלק</span><span class="font5">, “Amalek came;” where did Amalek&nbsp;come from? Our verse must be understood in terms of what&nbsp;we have been told in Genesis 36,6, where Esau and all his&nbsp;clans are reported as having moved away from the land of&nbsp;Canaan, after the reconciliation which included Esau’s&nbsp;ceding the claim to the land of Canaan to his brother&nbsp;Yaakov’s descendants. At that time </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explained that&nbsp;Esau, aware of the promise and curse G’d had made to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Avraham at the covenant between the pieces in Genesis chapter 15, the promise of taking over the land of Canaan&nbsp;had been made conditional on Abraham’s descendants&nbsp;having been strangers and part of that time even slaves, for&nbsp;400 years. Esau decided then to forego the promise in order&nbsp;to escape the curse of the 400 year wait. His descendants,&nbsp;one of whom was his grandson Amalek, realised that the 400&nbsp;years had elapsed and that by now the only thing that was&nbsp;left was the promise. He therefore decided that as the older&nbsp;son of Yitzock’s descendant, to stake his claim by force. He&nbsp;was also aware that his grandfather had been motivated to&nbsp;leave the land of Canaan as he had looked like a great fool&nbsp;for having sold his birthright, which had given Yaakov, as the&nbsp;firstborn, a claim to the land of Canaan. He believed the time&nbsp;was ripe then, especially while the Israelites were in noman’s land, land that they had no claim to, would not enjoy&nbsp;preferential treatment by G’d in such an encounter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,9. בחר לנו אנשים</span><span class="font5">, “select for us some men!” Moses wanted men who had been born in the second month of&nbsp;Adar, (people born in that month were believed to be free of&nbsp;fear of sorcerers and witches (compare a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> quoted on&nbsp;this verse in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> by Rabbi M. Kasher, item 58)&nbsp;Such people reputedly were not subject to negative&nbsp;influences of the twelve constellations of the zodiac. [This&nbsp;editor does not understand, how, seeing that the lunar&nbsp;calendar for the Jewish people had only been introduced a&nbsp;few weeks before the events in which the events related in&nbsp;our chapter took place, Joshua could have known who had&nbsp;been born during what would have been the second month of&nbsp;Adar. You may also find the commentary of Rabbeinu&nbsp;Bachya on this verse of special interest. Ed.] The Amalekites&nbsp;were reputed to be great astrologists, and able to foretell&nbsp;future events based on that. Seeing that the second month of&nbsp;Adar is the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">thirteenth</span><span class="font5"> month, and not governed by any&nbsp;constellation, people born in that month did not need to fear&nbsp;predetermined events they might be subject to. The&nbsp;sorcerers would be powerless during that month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of our verse: Moses instructs Joshua to mobilise a number of fighting men that would&nbsp;equal the ones at the disposal of the Amalekites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אנכי נצב על ראש הגבעה, </span><span class="font5">“I will position myself on the summit of the hill;” Moses wanted to be able to follow the&nbsp;course of the battle while personally watching, and even&nbsp;more, so that the Israelite fighters could see their leader and&nbsp;be encouraged by this visual contact. We find a verse in&nbsp;Joshua 8,26, where the latter, by that time the leader of the&nbsp;Jewish people, emulated Moses’ example by not lowering his&nbsp;spear until victory in battle had been secured. It is a common&nbsp;practice in war that one of the popular heroes positions&nbsp;himself on a hill or tower, holding aloft a flag in order to serve&nbsp;as encouragement to the troops seeing that the flag is a&nbsp;common symbol. As long as the troops can see their flag&nbsp;being held aloft they derive encouragement from this. If for&nbsp;some reason the troops fail to see the flag being held aloft&nbsp;they become demoralised. Moses’ </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">staff</span><span class="font5"> in this instance&nbsp;served as a flag for the Israelites fighting Amalek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,10. ומשה ואהרן וחור</span><span class="font5">, and Moses Aaron and Chur; seeing that the Torah will tell us about what Aaron and Chur&nbsp;did during that time, Chur was introduced to us here. Aaron&nbsp;and Chur would support Moses’ arms while Moses was&nbsp;standing on the summit of the hill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,12. וידי משה כבדים </span><span class="font5">“and Moses’ hands became heavy;” it was tiresome for Moses to have to stand all day&nbsp;long, as we know from verse 9 where he announced that on&nbsp;the following day he would take up a position on the top of&nbsp;the hill, and it would be difficult for him to keep his hands&nbsp;lifted upwards all day long. Aaron and Chur provided a stone&nbsp;for Moses to sit on; and they supported his arms from either&nbsp;side so that he could keep holding his staff aloft. All of this&nbsp;was necessary in order that the people would not become&nbsp;demoralised. The expression: אמונה, describes anything that&nbsp;does not weaken or decrease in size when remaining in the&nbsp;same position for a long time, such as from morning to&nbsp;evening. An example of the meaning of אמונה what we&nbsp;described are found in Isaiah 22,23: ותקעתיו יתד במקום נאמן, “I&nbsp;will fix him as a peg in a firm place.” There are numerous&nbsp;other examples of this kind. Moses’ doing this enabled&nbsp;Joshua to weaken the Amalekites and their troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once the Torah writes of ידו, “his hand”, singular mode, and another time it writes ידיו, “his hands,” plural mode. At&nbsp;the beginning of the battle Moses raised only one of his&nbsp;hands, while lowering his second hand; eventually both of his&nbsp;hands had become too heavy for him to keep aloft without&nbsp;someone supporting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> quoted in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> item 94, in the name of several well known commentators, none of&nbsp;whom have revealed the name of that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5">, we find the&nbsp;following interpretation of the words in this paragraph: the&nbsp;word אמונה, is a reminder of Avraham who had been&nbsp;complimented by G’d on his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">emunah,</span><span class="font5"> “faith,” already in&nbsp;Genesis chapter 15. When Moses’ prayer on behalf of his&nbsp;people embattled against Amalek had not elicited a response&nbsp;from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> he appealed to the forefather Avraham to join&nbsp;his plea. The words: עד בא, are a hint that he similarly turned&nbsp;to the Jewish people’s forefather Yitzchok, of whom we read&nbsp;that he had returned from prayer at the well where Hagar’s&nbsp;prayer had been answered. (Genesis 24,62). The words: עד&nbsp;בוא השמש, are a reminder of our forefather Yaakov who had&nbsp;prematurely spent a night at Luz where he had his first&nbsp;prophetic revelation in the dream with the ladder. (Genesis&nbsp;28,11 כי בא </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">השמש</span><span class="font5">). Moses called on the combined merits of&nbsp;all three forefathers to reinforce his prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our author quotes from Genesis 49,22 and Samuel I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">4,15, as well as from Joshua 20,9, that the word אמונה&nbsp;applied here to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> of Moses’ hands, is a legitimate mode of&nbsp;the feminine mode corresponding to the masculine plural&nbsp;mode of the word אמונים.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,13. ויחלוש יהושע את עמלק</span><span class="font5">, “Joshua succeeded in weakening the armies of Amalek.” [In order to understand the&nbsp;following it is important to realise that in this battle we do not&nbsp;hear of either side suffering fatalities. The word חרב, for&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">lethal</span><span class="font5"> sword,” does not appear once. Ed. The Amalekites&nbsp;had employed the weapon of sorcery in order to weaken the&nbsp;Jewish people. The swords used had not caused a single&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">death</span><span class="font5">, hence the Torah only speaks of the Amalekites having&nbsp;been “weakened.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of the unusual expression: ויחלוש. This term was used since the Torah had previously written&nbsp;that when Moses’ hands had weakened וגבר עמלק, “Amalek&nbsp;was gaining the upper hand,” it was appropriate to use a&nbsp;word meaning the opposite after the battle ended, i.e. while&nbsp;the Israelites had gotten the upper hand, they had only&nbsp;succeeded in beating off the attack. On the other hand, there&nbsp;is an instance where the expression ויחלוש, is used as&nbsp;describing someone dying, i.e. וגבר </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ימות</span><span class="font5"> ויחלש, (Job 14,9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,14. כתוב</span><span class="font5">, “record in writing!” but not only orally; if this&nbsp;piece of history would be handed down from father to son&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> orally, it would be exposed to becoming forgotten in the&nbsp;course of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[When G’d eventually commanded King Sha-ul to carry out the commandment to wipe out Amalek, and that nation&nbsp;had not had any contact with the Jewish people for 200&nbsp;years, none of the Israelites would have understood why they&nbsp;had to commit this kind of genocide. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The written Torah itself had foretold in Deuteronomy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">25,19, that this commandment would be carried out only after&nbsp;the Jewish people faced no more enemies all around it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זאת זכרון בספר</span><span class="font5">, “this atrocity that the Amalektites had committed against the Jewish people, attacking it in the&nbsp;desert, without any provocation whatsoever.

There were also written records known as the&nbsp;history of the kings of Israel (Kings I 14, 19-29) as well as the&nbsp;books of Solomon (Kings I 5,12) (Compare Ibn Ezra on this)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באזני יהושע</span><span class="font5">, “and commit it orally to Joshua;” he who had begun to carry out the commandment of wiping out</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Amalek deserves the credit to see to it that this book is handed down from generation to generation until a king will&nbsp;arise in Israel who will complete the task that Joshua began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d warns the people not to be astounded at the absolute harshness of this command</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Neither are we to assume that there had been military encounters between the Israelites and the Amalekites until&nbsp;some 400 years later years later under King Sha-ul. There&nbsp;had not been any. The unforgivable sin of the Amalekites&nbsp;was that when after the Israelites had crossed the sea of&nbsp;reeds and the Egyptians drowned in pursuit, when all the&nbsp;surrounding nations had been so impressed and lived in&nbsp;trepidation so that they were ready to accept the universal&nbsp;kingdom of heaven, this nation had appeared to show them&nbsp;that one could stand up against the chosen people and&nbsp;survive such an encounter, i.e. that their G’d was not&nbsp;invincible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ריבן ש</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מזבח, </span><span class="font5">“he built an altar there</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">; </span><span class="font5">Moses built&nbsp;the altar at the bottom of Mount Chorev.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקרא את שמר: ה' נסי</span><span class="font5">, “he named it: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hashem</span><span class="font5"> is My banner.” According to Rabbi Eliezer hamoda-i, the subject of&nbsp;the words “he named it” was the Lord Himself. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points&nbsp;out that we know of something similar from Genesis 33,20: In&nbsp;that verse we read that Yaakov, after being the first Jew to&nbsp;be able to buy a piece of land in the Holy Land (apart from&nbsp;the tomb of Sarah) built an altar and when the Torah reports&nbsp;that that altar was called: א-ל אלוקי ישראל, that was the name&nbsp;given to this altar by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי יד על כס י-ה</span><span class="font5">, “for as long Israel will possess the&nbsp;power to appoint to sit on the throne of G’d;” we know of a&nbsp;similar -though strangely sounding-formulation, from&nbsp;Chronicles I 29,23: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישב שלמה על כסא ה' למלך תחת דוד אביר</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Solomon successfully took over the throne of the Lord as king instead of his father David.” The verse describes&nbsp;conditions when it will be possible to wage G’d’s war against&nbsp;Amalek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יד</span><span class="font5">, the word יד normally translated as “hand,” in this instance refers to power, Royal authority.” We know of a&nbsp;similar example for the meaning of that word from Samuel I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">15,12, where the prophet Shmuel was advised of Sha-ul’s&nbsp;arriving at Mount Carmel, and he prepares for this by&nbsp;erecting a יד, for him, i.e. an altar. The words there are: והנה&nbsp;הוא מציב לו יד. In Samuel II 8,3 we also find the word יד used&nbsp;in this sense when David built an altar. [Not the traditional&nbsp;understanding of the word by most commentators. Ed.] The&nbsp;word כסא usually is used as a symbol of power, Royal Power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[If this is so, the word יד in the same line cannot mean the same, of course. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the verse means that as long as nations, or especially Amalek, see in Jerusalem and what&nbsp;its stands for its spiritual nemesis, there will be an ongoing&nbsp;war between G’d and His representative on earth, Israel;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מלחמה לה' בעמלק</span><span class="font5">, “a state of war between G’d and Amalek; this phrase is what the liturgist has in mind when he&nbsp;wrote in his poetic prayer recited on the Sabbath preceding&nbsp;the reading of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat zachor</span><span class="font5"> on the Sabbath preceding&nbsp;Purim.־, commencing with the words: אלוקים אל דמי לך, “do not&nbsp;be silent o G’d”; the author queries G’d’s relative inactivity&nbsp;versus Amalek although He has dealt more harshly with&nbsp;other adversaries throughout history. [There are only few&nbsp;congregations in which this liturgical poem is recited&nbsp;nowadays in the synagogues. It is lengthy and the language&nbsp;requires assistance by commentaries as provided in the&nbsp;prayer book known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">otzar ha-tefillot.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.] G’d’s answer is&nbsp;that until Amalek attacks G’d directly, not just His people, it is&nbsp;our task to deal with him, once he does the latter, G’d&nbsp;personally will wipe him out, This is why when Titus&nbsp;destroyed the Temple in Jerusalem G’d dealt with him,&nbsp;whereas at this stage it was our task to fight him. According&nbsp;to Jeremiah 3,17 Jerusalem is called G’d’s throne.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Page 477A Parshat Yitro</span></h1>

It is also supported by the fact&nbsp;that the Torah mentions Yitro and Amalek in one breath in&nbsp;Samuel I 15,6: ויאמר שאול אל הקיני סורו רדו מתוך עמלקי פן אוסיפך&nbsp;עמו. “Shaul said to the Kenite: “separate yourself from the&nbsp;Amalekite so that you do not become a victim when I wipe&nbsp;out the Amalekite.’” Yitro had seven different names in the&nbsp;Torah, one of which is “Kenite.” How did Yitro hear about all&nbsp;this now? Maybe someone had escaped from the battle with&nbsp;Amalek and he heard it from him.</span></p>

Years earlier, when Moses was in the home of Yitro,&nbsp;Moses described hjs claim to fame as having Yitro the priest&nbsp;as his father-in-law. (Compare Exodus 4,18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את כל אשר עשה אלוקים למשה</span><span class="font5">, “all that G’d had done for Moses.” 1) That G’d had saved him from Pharaoh; 2) that he&nbsp;had become the leader of a great nation. 3) That he had&nbsp;achieved this stature in a place that previously sought to&nbsp;execute him.</span></p>

If the Torah had not told us this at this point, we&nbsp;would not have known that Tzipporah and her children had&nbsp;never been in Egypt with Moses, i.e. had not participated in&nbsp;the Exodus. The last that we heard of her was that Moses&nbsp;had taken her and his children with him on the way to Egypt&nbsp;and that they had been riding on a donkey (Exodus 4,20)&nbsp;She had performed the circumcision on her younger son, but&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">nothing</span><span class="font5"> had been written about her returning to Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גר הייתי</span><span class="font5">, “I had been a stranger, etc.” the word הייתי&nbsp;is not to be understood as being in the past tense, just as&nbsp;Genesis 23,13: נתתי or 14,22 הרימותי or 32,11 </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">הייתי</span><span class="font5"> לשני מחנות</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">are not to be understood as being in the past tense.

It therefore&nbsp;appeared to Moses as if this really was his first son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצילני מחרב פרעה</span><span class="font5">, “He has saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.” The Pharaoh who sought to kill Moses had died&nbsp;some time earlier. G’d had told him this in Exodus 4,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: He did not call Eliezer his second son, as his birth had nothing to do with that of&nbsp;Gershom, as we explained on Exodus 4,26. The reason was&nbsp;that he had not been able to circumcise his first son due to&nbsp;the agreement with his father-in-law at the time he had&nbsp;married Tzipporah. [Compare what the author wrote on page&nbsp;376. Ed.] From G’d’s point of view, Eliezer was Moses’ first&nbsp;son, as after having been circumcised he was Jewish. As&nbsp;such he belonged to G’d, seeing that we aj] are G’d’s&nbsp;firstborn.</span></p>

This&nbsp;prevented Yitro’s messenger to get to his destination. He&nbsp;therefore attached a note to an arrow which he shot into the&nbsp;cloud explaining who he was and why he wanted to be&nbsp;admitted through the cloud. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Tanchuma)</span></p>

The reason is that&nbsp;when analysing the method by which G’d imposes penalties&nbsp;on the sinners, it becomes evident that the punishment&nbsp;matches the sin committed. The Egyptians’ crime had been&nbsp;that they drowned the Jewish babies; they had been&nbsp;punished by being drowned themselves. In Nechemya,&nbsp;chapter 9, where when a celebration of the Sukkot festival,&nbsp;after a Day of Atonement on which the people confessed&nbsp;their collective sin in Jerusalem is described in detail, the&nbsp;author </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">also</span><span class="font5"> describes the greatness of G’d as being reflected&nbsp;in the manner in which punishment matches the sins&nbsp;committed. (verse 10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עולה וזבחים, </span><span class="font5">”burnt offerings and meat offerings”&nbsp;(the latter to be consumed by the owners of those animals&nbsp;and their guests). Both types of offerings were in the nature&nbsp;of thanksgiving offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבא אהרן וכל זקני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “Aaron and all the elders of Israel came (to partake in the meal) Moses did not need to “come,”&nbsp;seeing the offerings were consumed in his tent. The other&nbsp;dignitaries came in honour of Yitro, Moses’ father-in-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לפני האלוקים</span><span class="font5">, according to the plain meaning the word לפני means the same as מלפני, ‘to take part in what had been&nbsp;offered in the presence of the Lord,” i.e. the meat offerings.&nbsp;[The burnt offering was always completely burned up on the&nbsp;altar. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי ממחרת</span><span class="font5">, “it was on the morrow;” according to&nbsp;the plain meaning of the text the day referred to is the day&nbsp;following the meal just described. The previous day had been&nbsp;spent in honouring Yitro so that Moses did not have time to&nbsp;sit and judge the people’s complaints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> explanation of the word ממחרת commences with the words that it was the day after the Day of Atonement&nbsp;when Moses had returned from Mount Sinai for the third</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">time. [This would have been way after the sin of the golden calf. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You might ask how it was possible for Moses to sit in judgment of the people at such a time, when all their sins had&nbsp;just been forgiven, and especially in view of the fact that the&nbsp;Torah testifies that immediately after Moses’ return on that&nbsp;occasion Moses assembled the people (Exodus 35,1) and&nbsp;after briefly explaining that the building of the Tabernacle&nbsp;which was to commence forthwith did not override the work&nbsp;prohibitions of the Sabbath, and that that work was&nbsp;completed already on the 25<sup>th</sup> day of Kislev of the same year&nbsp;(second year after the Exodus), we must understand the line&nbsp;describing Moses as sitting judging the people, does not&nbsp;refer to all the people who had problems lining up at that&nbsp;time, [after Moses for over 120 days had not spent a single&nbsp;full day in the camp since his ascent to Sinai to receive the&nbsp;first set of the Tablets. Ed]. He dealt only with the problems&nbsp;of the individuals who were not busy with donating for the&nbsp;Tabernacle or helping Betzalel in its construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> himself, in his commentary on Exodus 34,29-32, comments that after descending from the Mountain, Moses&nbsp;sat down to teach Torah to all those not preoccupied with the&nbsp;building of the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> in his commentary on our verse here writes: “this paragraph has not been written (or inserted) in the&nbsp;chronological order of events, seeing that the words: ויהי&nbsp;ממחרת, seeing that Moses did not part with Yitro who returned&nbsp;home until the second year of the Israelites wanderings as&nbsp;we know from Numbers 10,29, something </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">even</span><span class="font5"> admitted by&nbsp;the scholars who claim that Yitro had arrived at the camp of&nbsp;the Jewish people already before the revelation at Mount&nbsp;Sinai.” If the lines in Number 10,29 referred to an event&nbsp;before the revelation, why did the Torah not record that Yitro&nbsp;did not even stay for that event? Moreover, when we read in&nbsp;Judges 4,11, that the descendants of Yitro at that time had&nbsp;lived near Kedesh near the shores of the sea of Galilee, how&nbsp;come that their even </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">leaving</span><span class="font5"> their homeland Midian was not&nbsp;mentioned anywhere? (part of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on our verse)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our author continues: Yitro, in Numbers definitely declined Moses’ offer of becoming part of the Jewish people,&nbsp;when he said: “I will not go (with you).” (Numbers 10,30) If&nbsp;this statement were to apply to a point in time before the&nbsp;revelation, i.e. that our paragraph describes events before&nbsp;the revelation, what was the point of Moses being quoted as&nbsp;debating Yitro’s remaining with the Israelites at a time at&nbsp;least a year later?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have a verse in Proverbs 14,10: לב יודע מרת נפשו ובשמחתו לא יתערב זר, “the heart knows of its soul’s bitterness; a&nbsp;stranger does not share its joy.” Our sages in an early&nbsp;version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash Tanchuma,</span><span class="font5"> interpreted this verse to mean&nbsp;that G’d did not want that Yitro should share the joy of the&nbsp;Jewish people at the time of the revelation at Mount Sinai, as&nbsp;this was reserved for the people who had endured the&nbsp;hardships of slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. At any&nbsp;rate, Moses did not bid farewell to Yitro at the time discussed&nbsp;here. If he had come to the Jewish camp prior to the&nbsp;revelation, then he had had to temporarily withdraw during&nbsp;these days before rejoining the Israelites for almost another&nbsp;year. As soon as he returned from his temporary absence he&nbsp;observed Moses teaching the Torah, and he questioned the&nbsp;fact that the people had to stand, and that Moses had not&nbsp;appointed any delegates at all. When we read in verse 27 of&nbsp;our chapter that Moses bade his father-in-law farewell, and&nbsp;the Torah </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">adds</span><span class="font5"> that he returned to his homeland, it is clear&nbsp;that he had bid him farewell once before when Yitro had not&nbsp;yet returned to his homeland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישב משה לשפוט</span><span class="font5">, Moses sat down in order to hand down judgments or rulings; whenever we encounter the term וישב, it&nbsp;refers to someone who sat down in the expectation that he&nbsp;would remain seated for a longer period. An example of this&nbsp;is found in Deuteronomy 1,46, where it meant that the&nbsp;Israelites stayed in Kadesh about 19 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לשפוט את העם</span><span class="font5">, “to judge the people.” Some commentators believe that the word: העם refers to the mixed&nbsp;multitude, the fellow travelers whom Moses had accepted as&nbsp;converts, and who, as a result, had demanded from him that&nbsp;they receive a share of the loot of their fellow Jews who had&nbsp;taken these from their former relatives In Egypt. (Compare&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> by Rabbi M. Kasher in his notes on item 95)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן הבקר עד הערב</span><span class="font5">, “from the morning till the evening.” Is it conceivable that Moses spent the entire day judging? We&nbsp;therefore have to pay closer attention to the precise wording.&nbsp;The words: מ! הבקר, mean: from after the morning, not the&nbsp;entire morning. Similarly, the words: עד הערב</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">until evening,”&nbsp;are meant to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">exclude </span><span class="font5">the period called evening. If it were to&nbsp;be understood literally, when would the students have time to&nbsp;study Torah? Therefore the word מן here as well as&nbsp;elsewhere, is meant as a limitation, not the whole morning&nbsp;but part of the morning hours. Similarly, when the word&nbsp;appears in connection with היום, it does not refer to the whole&nbsp;day but to part of the day. Our sages suggested that what&nbsp;was meant is the first six hours. (Based on the Baraitha of&nbsp;Rabbi Eliezer.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,14. אשר הוא עושה לעם</span><span class="font5">, “what he was doing to the people.” They were making one another impatient. On the&nbsp;one hand, the common people were forced to stand in line&nbsp;most of the day waiting for their turn. On the other hand,&nbsp;Moses was becoming more and more weary having to deal&nbsp;with so many disputes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">?מדוע אתה יושב לבדך, </span><span class="font5">“why are only you seated?” Yitro did </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font5"> criticize Moses for sitting and the people having to stand;&nbsp;he meant that if Moses would delegate some of his tasks&nbsp;there would not be such long queues. The Torah itself&nbsp;expects the litigants to be standing, as we know form&nbsp;Deuteronomy 19,17: 'ועמדו שני האנשים אשר להם הריב לפני ה,&nbsp;“and the two men who have a dispute are to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">stand</span><span class="font5"> in the&nbsp;presence of the judges;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Besides, it would not have been appropriate for Yitro to chastise a great man like Moses, someone who was even&nbsp;addressed as “my master” by his own brother Aaron who&nbsp;was three years his senior. (Compare Numbers 12,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The verse in front of us has to be understood as follows: “what made you decide to shoulder the entire burden&nbsp;of judging all the people’s problems all by yourself, without&nbsp;assistance from anyone? You would do well to appoint junior&nbsp;judges that can share the burden with you, so that you would&nbsp;only have to deal with the litigations that these juniors could&nbsp;not find a proper solution for. All this will result in your burden&nbsp;being decreased so that you do not break down under it&nbsp;prematurely. Moses had first misunderstood his father-in-law&nbsp;as being critical that he alone remained seated throughout&nbsp;these proceedings. This is why he had replied that the&nbsp;people had come to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him;</span><span class="font5"> (verse 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן בקר עד ערב</span><span class="font5">, from morning till evening. Yitro meant that “even if you were to sit here from morning till evening you&nbsp;could still not cope with such a load.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את חוקי האלוקים ואת תורותיו</span><span class="font5">, “G’d’s statutes and&nbsp;His teachings.” Moses refers to the statutes and teachings&nbsp;that G’d had already taught him prior to the revelation at&nbsp;Mount Sinai, and his ascending that Mountain to receive the&nbsp;whole Torah. Those teachings had been referred to when the&nbsp;people had been encamped around </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marah</span><span class="font5"> when the bitter&nbsp;waters had been turned into sweet waters (Exodus 15,25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא טוב הדבר</span><span class="font5">, “the matter is not right;” in my eyes&nbsp;what you are doing now is not good;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נבול תבול</span><span class="font5">, “you will definitely become worn out;”&nbsp;the word is similar to ערבוב, “being confused.” Compare&nbsp;Genesis 11,7 Where G’d confused man’s languages. Yitro&nbsp;felt that Moses would confuse the litigants because each one&nbsp;would shout that he wanted to be heard next. As a result, he&nbsp;himself would become confused. This would be due to his&nbsp;inability to hear each person correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גם אתה</span><span class="font5">, “you also.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands the word גם as including Aaron and Chur, and the seventy elders. If you&nbsp;were to point out that in Exodus 32,5, on the words: ויבן מזבח&nbsp;לפניו, “he built an altar in front of it (the golden calf),” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">comments that Aaron, having seen that Chur (his nephew)&nbsp;had been killed by the mob when he tried to interfere with&nbsp;their worshipping the golden calf, decided to instead build an&nbsp;altar and declare the following day a holiday in honour of G’d.&nbsp;The events related there occurred on the 17<sup>th</sup> of Tammuz in&nbsp;the first year of the people’s wanderings. Yitro meant that&nbsp;even if Aaron, Chur and the seventy elders were to assist&nbsp;Moses, this would not nearly be enough for governing such a&nbsp;large nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find an example of such thinking in Jeremiah 15,1, where G’d tells the prophet that even if Moses personally as&nbsp;well as the prophet Samuel were to intercede on behalf the&nbsp;people of the Kingdom of Yehudah at that time, their merits&nbsp;would not suffice to make Him change His mind concerning&nbsp;the impending doom of that kingdom. G’d mentioned Moses&nbsp;and Samuel who had already long ago passed on, The&nbsp;events recorded in the paragraph that we are dealing with&nbsp;here occurred the day after the Day of Atonement on the&nbsp;eleventh day of Tishrey, over 80 days after Chur had been&nbsp;killed. Nonetheless, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> saw fit to mention him as an&nbsp;example of a worthy assistant of Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, in verse 23 in our chapter, Chur is not mentioned by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands the words: וכל&nbsp;העם הזה (and all this people) as applicable to Aaron, his two&nbsp;older sons, and the seventy elders, no mention is made of&nbsp;Chur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל העם הזה</span><span class="font5">, they will also not be able to endure the long wait all day long to have their litigation dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.19. היה אתה לעם מול האלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “be you for the nation an intermediary between them and G’d;” Yitro meant that Moses&nbsp;appoint himself as intermediary due his constantly being&nbsp;prepared through ritual purity and readiness to warn them&nbsp;against trespassing any of G’d’s laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,21. אנשי חיל</span><span class="font5">, “men who are mentally able to through the strength of their personalities to endure the people&nbsp;demand and not be cowed by their threats.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יראי אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, men who only fear G’d, and not their fellow human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שונאי בצע</span><span class="font5">, men who despise to make money only through being successful in litigation. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> bases himself on&nbsp;the saying in the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Batra</span><span class="font5"> folio 58; “any judge&nbsp;from whom one extracts money only by means of legal&nbsp;proceedings, is not fit to be a judge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is the correct interpretation of the expression: “they hate money gained through litigation?” Example: one of&nbsp;the litigants threatens the judge that if he is not found justified&nbsp;in his claim against his fellow man, that litigant will burn the&nbsp;judge’s house down, or threats of a similar nature. If such a&nbsp;judge is undeterred by such threats, he truly fits the definition&nbsp;of people whom Yitro called שונאי בצע. If, however he indicts&nbsp;the innocent and convicts the guilty, out of fear of the threats&nbsp;that had been made against him, the opposite party of the&nbsp;one who had won in the litigation is considered as having&nbsp;won judgment only by dint of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">legal</span><span class="font5"> proceedings but not by&nbsp;dint of having been found </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">righteous</span><span class="font5"> in his claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שרי אלפים</span><span class="font5">, “chiefs in charge of thousands; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> there would be 600 such “chiefs.” There would be six&nbsp;thousand chiefs” of hundreds and 60000 chiefs of ten&nbsp;Israelites each, so that there would be a total of 78600&nbsp;“judges.” If so we have to assume that these were in addition&nbsp;to the 600000 ordinary Israelites, and who had not been&nbsp;included in the census. [There are numerous problems with&nbsp;this count. See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tossaphot Baba Batra</span><span class="font5"> 121, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators suggest that there is no problem at all as all these “judges” were over the age of 60, and thus&nbsp;would not have been included in the census at any rate. The&nbsp;Talmud stated explicitly that males under 20 years of age&nbsp;and over 60 years of age were never included in any census.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third opinion holds that each group of “chiefs” was included in the census of his particular category, i.e. the&nbsp;chiefs of thousands in the count of each one thousand&nbsp;Israelites, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.22. ושפטו את העם בכל עת</span><span class="font5">, “they would be ready to sit in judgment of the people at any time.” The reason they&nbsp;would always be available, said Yitro, was that they did not&nbsp;have to take time out to speak with G’d as Moses often was&nbsp;in the habit of doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והקל מעליך</span><span class="font5">, “thus you can make it easier for yourself;” according to some commentators this phrase can be&nbsp;understood not only as advice or prediction, but as&nbsp;tantamount to a command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על מקומו</span><span class="font5">, “to his tent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יבוא בשלום</span><span class="font5">, they will immediately be able to go home, as they did not have to line up at a single point [in a camp the&nbsp;size of which was over 12 by 12 kilometers. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,25. ויבחר משה אנשי חיל</span><span class="font5">, “Moses selected capable men;” the meaning of the words אנשי חיל, is that he selected&nbsp;men whose qualities corresponded to the criteria stipulated&nbsp;by his father-in-law, Yitro in verse 21. Moses at least </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">knew&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">beyond doubt who were the wealthy men among the&nbsp;Israelites, and who could therefore be more or less immune&nbsp;to the temptation of bribes. As far as the invisible virtues&nbsp;were concerned that his father-in-law had stipulated as&nbsp;criteria for making someone suitable to be a judge, he had to&nbsp;rely on his intuition and G’d’s help. This is why they were not&nbsp;mentioned here, as Moses’ judgment was not based on&nbsp;evidence acceptable in a court of law. Even forty years later&nbsp;when Moses recalls the episode, he speaks only about&nbsp;characteristics which are visible, i.e. possessing insight,&nbsp;displaying wisdom and possessing knowledge, i.e חכמים&nbsp;נבונים, ידועים. (Compare Deuteronomy 1,13) No one, on the&nbsp;other hand, can be sure if his fellow man truly is a G’d fearing&nbsp;person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,27. וישלח</span><span class="font5">, “he accompanied him, (when Yitro left for home;)” This is what he had learned from Avraham, who&nbsp;after royally hosting the angels saw them off by&nbsp;accompanying them some distance as reported in Genesis</span></p>
<p dir="rtl"><span class="font5">.ואברהם הולך עמם </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">לשלחם</span><span class="font5"> :18,16</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators believe that the entire episode reported from the beginning of chapter 18, took place </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the revelation of G’d at Mount Sinai when the people&nbsp;received the second set of the Tablets, Moses having&nbsp;smashed the first set. Moses had descended from the&nbsp;Mountain with that set on the tenth day of Tishrey, and the&nbsp;verse beginning with the words: ויהי ממחרת, “it was on the&nbsp;following day, etc.” would have been the 11<sup>th</sup> day of that&nbsp;month. (18,13) What had been reported prior to this, i.e.&nbsp;Yitro’ arrival, being welcomed, and offering sacrifices all took&nbsp;place still on the tenth, after Moses had arrived and placed&nbsp;the Tablets in the ark which had been prepared for it. This&nbsp;corresponds to the way </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains all this at the end of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat ki tissa,</span><span class="font5"> (Exodus 33,11 and 34,29. Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">on Deuteronomy 1,9 on the whole subject and the apparent&nbsp;contradictions there.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whether Yitro had arrived at the camp of the Israelites prior to the revelation or subsequently, there is unanimity&nbsp;amongst the sages that he did not return to his homeland&nbsp;before the second year in the month of lyar when the people&nbsp;made ready to proceed to the Holy Land, having been&nbsp;encamped around Mount Sinai for almost an entire year. If&nbsp;the line reporting Moses accompanying Yitro on his&nbsp;departure occurred in the chronological sequence reported&nbsp;by the Torah, then both he, Tzipporah, Moses’ wife, and his&nbsp;two sons would have belonged to the only generation that&nbsp;ever experienced such a revelation. If the Torah did not&nbsp;report events in their chronological sequence, we have to&nbsp;make peace with the fact that Tzipporah and her sons did not&nbsp;experience this event. [Yitro’s experiencing it or not is of&nbsp;secondary significance in the opinion of this editor. Ed.] The&nbsp;fact that neither of Moses’ sons are </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ever</span><span class="font5"> mentioned again by&nbsp;name in the Torah lends </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">some</span><span class="font5"> support to the opinion that&nbsp;they had not stood at Mount Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.1. בחדש</span><span class="font5">, “on the first of the (third month);” the word חדש is used here as in Samuel I 20,18: מחר חדש, “tomorrow is&nbsp;new moon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">השלישי</span><span class="font5">, it is called thus because it was when the Israelites were enslaved, נשבו, when they were liberated,&nbsp;נשתחחרו, and when they converted to Judaism, נתגגיירו. The&nbsp;latter word is the reflexive mode of גר, alien, stranger. Our&nbsp;sages in the Talmud </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ketuvot</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">37 taught us: different&nbsp;categories of female converts, including those who were&nbsp;prisoners and have been released and converted have to&nbsp;wait three months before they can marry a Jew, to eliminate&nbsp;the suspicion than a child born to them was sired by a gentile&nbsp;before they had converted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום הזה</span><span class="font5">, ”on this day;” the day referred to is the day they broke camp in Refidim. It was the first day of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">which&nbsp;occurred on a Monday, according to the opinion of the&nbsp;majority of the scholars. There was unanimity among the&nbsp;scholars that the day of the revelation was Sabbath.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Shabbat</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">86) According to the majority of the Rabbis who&nbsp;hold that that the revelation occurred on the sixth day of the&nbsp;month of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">the first day of that month had to have been&nbsp;on a Monday.

If you were to argue that if this is&nbsp;so then 50 days as opposed to 49 days, i.e. seven weeks,&nbsp;had elapsed since the Exodus, the answer is that the&nbsp;commandment regarding </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">when </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">omer</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">is to be offered was&nbsp;not given to the people (or obviously could not apply) until&nbsp;they had taken possession of the land and planted a crop.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Mandelbaum edition page 205), relates a parable [to explain that the Torah describing this detail conveyed a lesson worth&nbsp;taking to heart, Ed.] A king had a son who had recovered&nbsp;from a serious illness. He was told by a pedagogue that the&nbsp;son should go an elementary school forthwith. The father&nbsp;protested by saying to the pedagogue that his son was still&nbsp;too frail to go to school and be subjected to a strict regimen.&nbsp;He agreed to send him to school after a recovery period of&nbsp;three months. He intended to pamper him during these three&nbsp;so that he would recuperate faster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,2. ויסעו מרפידי</span><span class="font5">ם, “they journeyed on from Refidim, etc.” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> these words mean that the people&nbsp;moved forward spiritually, i.e. that they had repented their&nbsp;conduct once they moved on. All the time they were at&nbsp;Refidim they had not yet repented. [The reader is referred to&nbsp;chapter 18,7-9 where upon questioning whether the Lord&nbsp;was in their midst, and the subsequent attack by Amalek&nbsp;when they encamped at Refidim as Hjs way of showing them&nbsp;what would happen if He were not in their midst. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Yoshua in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 106, understood the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refidim</span><span class="font5"> as an allusion to the people’s&nbsp;having become very weak in their Torah orientation, as a&nbsp;result of which G’d had showed them that His protection of&nbsp;them would weaken accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחנו במדבר</span><span class="font5">, “they encamped in the desert;” the desert is no-man’s land, open to all and sundry to make their home&nbsp;there without being legally challenged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נגד ההר</span><span class="font5">, “facing the Mountain.” (Mount Sinai, also known as Mount Chorev). According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the reason for the&nbsp;Torah adding this detail is that it tells us that the Israelites&nbsp;faced East. It is noteworthy that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> does not say; במזרחו,&nbsp;“on its eastern side,” but: למזרחו, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">facing</span><span class="font5"> its eastern side.”&nbsp;Had he written במזרחו, this would have meant that the people&nbsp;had already passed the Mountain. We would have wondered&nbsp;how it was possible that the people had passed the Mountain&nbsp;before receiving the Torah, something G’d had told Moses&nbsp;they would do in Exodus 3,12, in answer to his query why the&nbsp;time for redemption had been advanced so many years over&nbsp;what G’d had said to Avraham at the covenant between the&nbsp;pieces in Genesis chapter 15. We must therefore understand&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here as meaning “the people encamped facing the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mountain, looking eastward, as they had been doing every time they had made camp, every time since they made camp&nbsp;for the first time at Eytam after they had previously&nbsp;converged together at a place named Sukkot, (Exodus&nbsp;13,20) They continued facing east when encamping until&nbsp;they came to the steppes of Moav, prior to crossing the&nbsp;Jordan river in a westerly direction. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on&nbsp;Numbers 34,3) This is what prompted </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> based on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta,</span><span class="font5"> that the word נגד when used by the Torah in&nbsp;connection with the Israelites’ journeys always means&nbsp;“eastward.” The only exception is when the people are&nbsp;described in Numbers 2,2, as encamping מנגד סביב לאהל מועד,&nbsp;where it means “opposite,” i.e. the Tabernacle was in the&nbsp;middle of the camp, the tribes camping around it, each group&nbsp;from a different direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,3. ומשה עלה</span><span class="font5">, “and Moses had ascended;” he ascended the Mountain on the second day of the month, i.e.&nbsp;on a Tuesday. He had not done so spontaneously but in&nbsp;response to an invitation by G’d, Who had called to him from&nbsp;the Mountain to address the whole nation, i.e. כה תאמר לבית&nbsp;יעקב וגו', “thus you shall say to the house of Yaakov, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators believe that Moses did ascend the Mountain without having asked for permission in order to&nbsp;enquire how precisely to serve G’d there. He did so as G’d&nbsp;had told him in Exodus 3,12 in response to his enquiry why&nbsp;the Jews were going to be redeemed long before the 400&nbsp;years of which G’d had spoken to Avraham in Genesis&nbsp;chapter 15 had been concluded. At that time G’d had told&nbsp;him that the people would accept the Torah at this mountain,&nbsp;and that in anticipation of that they were being redeemed&nbsp;ahead of time, “on credit,” so to speak. Actually, we find that&nbsp;the Israelites offered sacrifices near the Mountain prior to the&nbsp;revelation as reported in chapter 24,4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותגיד לבני ישראל, </span><span class="font5">“and explain in detail to the Children of Israel!” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the reason for the apparent&nbsp;repetition, the first part of the verse is addressed to the&nbsp;women who will be told in a brief outline, whereas the second&nbsp;part is addressed to the men in far greater detail&nbsp;emphasizing reward and punishment for observance or non&nbsp;observance of the Torah commandments. He derives the&nbsp;word ותגיד which is uncharacteristically spelled with the letter&nbsp;י in the middle as derived from the word גיד, meaning “a&nbsp;tough sinew,” as a hint that some of the commandments will&nbsp;be found to present a real challenge for those willing to&nbsp;observe them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning of the text, however, the words: ותגד לבני ישראל, refer to verse 4 where G’d tells Moses:&nbsp;אתם ראיתם, ”you have seen, etc.” The reason why this is the&nbsp;preferable version is that homiletic explanations never speak&nbsp;in terms of the future, but always in terms of the past. Here&nbsp;G’d instructs Moses concerning what he is to do in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">future&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">when he addresses the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.4. ואשא אתכם על כנפי נשרים</span><span class="font5">, “I have carried you on eagles’ wings;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this that this refers to the&nbsp;day on which the people came to Raamses. If you were to&nbsp;counter that in chapter 12,37 this magic carpet referred to the&nbsp;day G’d transported the people </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font5"> Raamses to Sukkot, we&nbsp;must answer that G’d referred to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> these days according&nbsp;to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על כנפי נשרים</span><span class="font5">, over the sea, like a bird that carries its young across a river by means of flying across it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמרתם את בריתי</span><span class="font5">, “you are to observe My&nbsp;covenant;” this refers to the covenant of blood discussed in&nbsp;Exodus 24,8, that Moses took the blood of the different types&nbsp;of offerings presented on the altar he had built and divided it&nbsp;in half, as a sign of a covenant between G’d and Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">סגולה מכל העמים</span><span class="font5">, “more treasured than all the other nations.” Seeing that the entire earth belongs to Me, I am&nbsp;able to raise your stature above that of all the other nations.&nbsp;The word כי in this verse is to be understood as meaning: in&nbsp;spite of, just as it means this in Genesis 48,14: כי מנשה הבכור,&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">although</span><span class="font5"> Menashe is the firstborn,” or the word כי in Exodus&nbsp;13,17, כי_קרוב הוא, “although it is near.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואתם תהיו לי ממלכת כהנים </span><span class="font5">“You are to become for&nbsp;Me, a kingdom of priests.” All this is the result of My&nbsp;fondness for you and My authority to do so since I own the&nbsp;universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבא משה, </span><span class="font5">“Moses came;” on the same day, and&nbsp;called the elders of the people to accompany him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישב משה</span><span class="font5">, “Moses brought back, etc;” this was on&nbsp;the following day, the third day of the month, the fourth day of&nbsp;the week. On the next day, the fourth day of the month: G’d,&nbsp;as stated in chapter 24,verse 1, G’d said to Moses in verse 2&nbsp;that Moses was to proceed further, alone. He immediately&nbsp;said to Moses that He would appear to him screened by a&nbsp;thick cloud, etc.; the purpose was that the people would be&nbsp;able to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hear </span><span class="font5">G’d speak to Moses and believe that he was&nbsp;truly the messenger of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> and that they would believe&nbsp;in his conveying truly what G’d said to him. If they had not&nbsp;been able to actually hear G’d speak to Moses, they would&nbsp;later on claim that G’d had not appeared to him. This is why&nbsp;He told Moses that as a result of what He was commanding&nbsp;him now the people would believe in him and never doubt&nbsp;him again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The words written in chapter 24 were spoken on this day, the fourth day of the month of Sivan, even though they&nbsp;appear only in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Mishpatim.</span><span class="font5"> Moses related all these&nbsp;words to the people as stated in verse 9 in our chapter. They&nbsp;concluded with: וגם בך יאמינו לעולם, “and they will also believe&nbsp;in you forthwith.” He also related to them at that time all the&nbsp;laws that he had been taught by G’d at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marah,</span><span class="font5"> (Exodus&nbsp;15,28) and committed them to parchment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately thereafter the people responded in verse 3 by agreeing to carry out all the instructions they had received&nbsp;from G’d via Moses. Upon hearing this, Moses immediately&nbsp;conveyed the people’s response to G’d, as stated here in our&nbsp;chapter in verse 9, quoting what is reported in chapter 24,&nbsp;verse 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> in our verse here, comments that the people in addition requested to hear all this from G’d personally,&nbsp;claiming that hearing matters directly from the source is&nbsp;always </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font5">more effective than hearing the same words&nbsp;from the messenger. (based on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> here</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">)</span><span class="font5"> The&nbsp;source for all this which has not been spelled out in the text&nbsp;of the Torah is verse 11, where G’d tells him the on the third&nbsp;(after this) He will </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">personally</span><span class="font5"> let them hear the Ten&nbsp;Commandments from His own mouth. G’d uses the&nbsp;expression: לעיני העם, that His words will be perceived by the&nbsp;“eyes” of the people. From this we deduce that people had&nbsp;asked for a visual revelation of G’d. [At the end of the Ten&nbsp;commandments in chapter 20,15, the Torah reports that&nbsp;G’d’s words were indeed a visual appearance for them when&nbsp;the Torah writes that all the people “saw” the “sounds.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On this same day, the fourth of the month, G’d told the people to sanctify themselves in preparation for the&nbsp;revelation on Mount Sinai. By refraining from engaging in&nbsp;marital intercourse for three days, they would be sufficiently&nbsp;sanctified by the 6<sup>th</sup> day of the month to merit this revelation.&nbsp;That day would again be the Sabbath. Sanctification included&nbsp;immersing their clothing in a ritual bath as commanded in&nbsp;verse 10, and carried out in verse 14. We know that the root&nbsp;כבס includes such sanctification through a ritual bath from&nbsp;Leviticus 17,15-16 that failure to do so will result in ritual&nbsp;contamination of a person that had eaten either animals that&nbsp;had died without undergoing ritual slaughter first, or parts of&nbsp;an animal which was found as having been diseased&nbsp;internally after being examined subsequent to ritual&nbsp;slaughter. Another example of the process of sanctification of&nbsp;human beings is found in Samuel II 11,4 where David is&nbsp;reported as not sleeping with Bat Sheva until after she had&nbsp;sanctified her body in a ritual bath. [She had been invited to&nbsp;his house by the King’s messengers. Ed.] The Israelites, both&nbsp;male and female, who at this point were undergoing similar&nbsp;immersion in a ritual bath, would then qualify for taking part&nbsp;in the revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,9. ויגד משה</span><span class="font5">, Moses told G’d what the people had said&nbsp;in detail. When we encountered a similar phrase previously&nbsp;in verse 8, it was appropriate for the Torah to use the&nbsp;expression: וישב, “he brought back a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">reply</span><span class="font5">,” as at that point&nbsp;he brought back a reply to something that had been&nbsp;requested from them, i.e. “if you will surely listen to Me.” Now&nbsp;there was no need to phrase their comments in this mode, as&nbsp;their willingness to obey G’d’s wishes had been established&nbsp;already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,11. ליום השלישי</span><span class="font5">, “for the third day.” This was the Sabbath on which the Torah would be given, the third day&nbsp;after Moses had been commanded to prepare the people for&nbsp;that day on the fourth of the month, a Thursday. On that day&nbsp;G’d would descend to the Mountain. Seeing that at this point&nbsp;the Torah did not spell out a specific time or date, this had to&nbsp;be done on another occasion, i.e. in Deuteronomy 5,27&nbsp;where Moses is to tell the people to return to their daily&nbsp;routine, whereas he is to ascend Mount Sinai and receive the&nbsp;whole Torah there during the next 40 days, as detailed at the&nbsp;beginning of chapter 24 in Exodus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators accept neither the opinion of the majority of the scholars nor that of Rabbi Yossi, both of&nbsp;whom held differing views as to the precise sequence and&nbsp;timing of the days of the week and days of the month on&nbsp;which events commencing with the Israelites encamping in&nbsp;the desert of Sinai and the conclusion of the revelation have&nbsp;been reported in the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.12. והגבלת את ההר</span><span class="font5">, “you are to “fence in“ the mountain;&nbsp;actually the Torah </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">writes</span><span class="font5">: “you shall set boundaries for the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">people</span><span class="font5">,” את העם. Our author understands this as fencing off&nbsp;the east side of the camp from the mountain. This is the&nbsp;direction from which the glory of G’d would appear, as we&nbsp;know from what Moses described in Deuteronomy 33,2 when&nbsp;he spoke about G’d having first offered His Torah to the&nbsp;gentile nations, who, upon enquiring what it contained&nbsp;decided to decline acceptance. He said then: ,וזרח משעיר למו&nbsp;הופיע מהר פרן, “He shone forth from the land of Seir (in the&nbsp;east) and He appeared from around Mount Paran.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאמר</span><span class="font5">, “to tell as a warning so that each Israelite would warn his neighbour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תגע בו יד</span><span class="font5">, “you must not touch </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him;”</span><span class="font5"> (the&nbsp;offender in order to pull him back) rather he shall be killed by&nbsp;stoning or by shooting arrows at him, but he must not be&nbsp;touched by human hand in order to be brought before a court&nbsp;of law to be dealt with. The Torah adds therefore that his&nbsp;death should occur without humans touching him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This prohibition applies equally to the Israelites’ beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask why ascending the mountain is a worse offense than killing such a person by stoning him while&nbsp;ascending? The reason is that if the offender were to be&nbsp;killed through human action, the party touching that body,&nbsp;dead or alive, would also be considered as having personally&nbsp;touched that Mountain, whose holiness is such that it must&nbsp;not be touched by human bodies. Seeing that the Torah did&nbsp;not even allow a beast to touch that mountain, and a beast is&nbsp;not ritually impure while alive, how much more would the&nbsp;Torah not allow a human being to touch it, seeing that a&nbsp;living human being is subject to being ritually defiled while&nbsp;alive as well as when dead; so why did the Torah have to&nbsp;spell out this regulation as applying also to the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer to this question can be learned from matters involving a high level of sanctity, such as the&nbsp;Tabernacle which was completely out of bounds to non&nbsp;priests. As soon as Nadav and Avihu approached to offer&nbsp;incense not prepared in accordance with the regulations&nbsp;pertaining to it, they were killed by lightning descending from&nbsp;G’d. They were not convicted after trial by a human court.&nbsp;Their corpses defiled the Tabernacle, although if they had&nbsp;been jailed and executed after a trial, the sanctity of the&nbsp;Tabernacle would not have been defiled. The same thing&nbsp;happened when Uzziah, King of Yehudah, not a priest,&nbsp;ascended the altar in the Temple of Solomon, planning to&nbsp;offer incense; after having been warned and having ignored&nbsp;the warning, he was struck by the dreaded skin disease of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> on his forehead, something which defiled his entire&nbsp;body even though he was standing on the holiest place on&nbsp;earth. (Chronicles II 26,16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the words: כי סקול יסקל, “for he will be stoned to death;” either with stones only, or with&nbsp;hail (stones). The words או ירה יירה, referring to the kind of&nbsp;hail that was a plague in Egypt would symbolise death both&nbsp;by stoning and by burning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> claims that we would have expected the Torah to decree death by either drowning in water, i.e. ירה יירה, as in&nbsp;Exodus 15,4 when the Egyptian army was tossed into the&nbsp;sea to drown, or if not then by stoning. He bases this on the&nbsp;principle stated in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 45, that prior to stoning, the&nbsp;victim is pushed down by one of the witnesses who had&nbsp;testified against him from a wall two stories high into a pit,&nbsp;and if that did not kill him the others stone him by throwing&nbsp;stones at him. Alternately, the word או in our verse here does&nbsp;not mean: “or,” but means the same as אשר, “which,” as it&nbsp;does in Exodus 21,6, והגישו אל הדלת או אל המזוזה, “to the door,&nbsp;i.e. the door post;” this line has been translated by Yonatan&nbsp;ben Uzziel Targum as ויקריבנו לות דשא דלוח מזוזתא “he will&nbsp;bring him close to the entrance which is the door-post.” The&nbsp;meaning of the line accordingly, is: “for the person violating&nbsp;this commandment will eventually be stoned to death after&nbsp;first having been thrown down into the pit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אם בהמה אם איש</span><span class="font5">, “regardless if man or domestic fourlegged animal; the category “bird” is not mentioned seeing that the messengers of the court would have no means of&nbsp;bringing it to justice. It would escape by flying away as soon&nbsp;as chased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במשוך היובל</span><span class="font5">, “after the ram’s horn emits a long blast, etc.” actually, the reference is to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">horn</span><span class="font5"> of the ram, קרן היובל, not&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ram</span><span class="font5">, יובל, as written here. It is not equivalent to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">used during the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel</span><span class="font5"> year. That </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar</span><span class="font5"> was not used until&nbsp;after the Tabernacle had been built during the second year of&nbsp;the Israelites’ wanderings. On this occasion, Moses used a&nbsp;ram’s horn to signal to the people that the Revelation and all&nbsp;this entailed had been concluded. based on the interpretation&nbsp;by Rabbi Saadyah gaon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation: the words: במשוך היובל, mean: “when the sound of the celestial </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar</span><span class="font5"> the people had&nbsp;been hearing during the revelation had come to end.” We&nbsp;find the word משך used in this context also in Hoseah 7,5: משך&nbsp;ידו את לוצצים, “he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">extended </span><span class="font5">his hand to scorners (instead of&nbsp;protecting the king).” The expression here signals that the&nbsp;presence of the glory of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> above the Mountain had&nbsp;come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">119,14. וירד משה</span><span class="font5">, “Moses descended;” on this same&nbsp;day, the fourth of the month, a Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקדש את העם</span><span class="font5">, “he sanctified the people.” The three days of sanctification commence on this day and concluded on the&nbsp;morning of the third day, although technically they could have&nbsp;immersed themselves in a ritual bath already after nightfall of&nbsp;the previous day, seeing that there was such a huge number&nbsp;of people, Moses extended the period for ritual immersion&nbsp;until the morning of the third day, thus giving them additional&nbsp;time. [“days” here are parts of days, according to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachic</span><span class="font5"> principle of מקצת היו ככולו, any portion of a “day” is&nbsp;considered as if it had been a full day.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר אל העם</span><span class="font5">, “he said to the people;” on the&nbsp;same day when he issued the instructions he told the people&nbsp;to be ready for the needs of what was going to occur at the&nbsp;end of this period of consecutive three days of sanctifying&nbsp;themselves, (by not having marital relations).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לשלשת ימים</span><span class="font5">, according to the plain meaning of these words the meaning is: “in anticipation of the third day.”&nbsp;According to the plain meaning, Moses did not add an&nbsp;additional day of preparation (sanctification) as suggested by&nbsp;some scholars. Other examples of a similar formulation in the&nbsp;Bible as here are Genesis 42,17: ויאסוף אותם אל משמר שלשת&nbsp;ימים, “Joseph put them in jail for three days.” Or, in the verse&nbsp;following: ויאמר אליהם יוסף ביום השלישי, “Joseph said to them&nbsp;on the third day;” or Genesis 40,19: בעוד שלשת ימים, “within&nbsp;another three days;” and in the verse following: ויהי ביום&nbsp;השלישי, “it was on the third day;” or Exodus 19,16: ויהי ביום&nbsp;השלישי, “it was on the third day;” there are numerous other&nbsp;examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי ביום השלישי</span><span class="font5">, “It was on the third day;” this was&nbsp;the Sabbath on which the Torah was given to the Jewish&nbsp;people, the third day of the preparatory ritual of sanctification.&nbsp;It was the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">third</span><span class="font5"> day after the fourth day of the month when&nbsp;these preparations had commenced. You have a total of six&nbsp;days from the day when the people made camp in the desert&nbsp;of Sinai, as stated in the first verse of our chapter. This is the&nbsp;interpretation of these verses according to the majority&nbsp;opinion of the scholars of the Talmud who held that the&nbsp;revelation took place on the sixth day of the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I shall now proceed to explain the view of Rabbi Yossi according to which the Torah was given to the people on the&nbsp;seventh day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan.</span><span class="font5"> The words: ביום הזה, “on this day” in&nbsp;verse 1 of our chapter, which was the first day of the month&nbsp;as well as the first day of the week, is based on the tradition&nbsp;that the day of the Exodus was on a Thursday. Accordingly,&nbsp;the first day of Sivan of that year would have been on a&nbsp;Sunday. On that day the people arrived at the desert of Sinai,&nbsp;and on that day Moses did not tell them anything as they&nbsp;were tired and were required to pitch their tents, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the second day, i.e. on Monday, Moses ascended the Mountain. This is followed by: “He called to him, etc.”&nbsp;until verse 8 where the people express their willingness to&nbsp;carry out any instructions they would receive from G’d. On&nbsp;the day following, on Tuesday, Moses conveyed the people’s&nbsp;answer to G’d. On the same day G’d told Moses in verse 9&nbsp;that He would appear to Him screened by a thick cloud, up to&nbsp;and including the words: “they will believe in you forthwith.”&nbsp;The day after, on the Wednesday, Moses relayed the&nbsp;people’s answer to G’d, i.e. ויגד משה את דברי העם. On the&nbsp;same day G’d says to Moses that the people should sanctify&nbsp;themselves on that day and the day following including their&nbsp;garments by immersing them in a ritual bath, activities&nbsp;performed on Wednesday and Thursday so that they would&nbsp;be ready for the revelation on the day following, (the third day&nbsp;of the preparations (verse 11) On the day following that day&nbsp;on the seventh day of the week, on the Sabbath, the Torah&nbsp;was given to them as agreed by all the scholars seeing that&nbsp;on that day G’d would descend onto to Mount Sinai, the day&nbsp;when it was forbidden to ascend the Mountain as the people&nbsp;had been warned in verse 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In verse 14, we read about Moses descending from the Mountain and carrying out G’d’s instructions. That day was&nbsp;Wednesday He told them to be ready on the third day (verse&nbsp;15) by the end of the first 12 hours [the day is divided into&nbsp;two periods of 12 hours each. Ed.] on the fourth day as he&nbsp;had been on the Mountain until daybreak on that Sabbath. It&nbsp;emerges from this that Moses had added an additional day&nbsp;for the people to prepare themselves for the revelation,&nbsp;seeing that G’d had only spoken of היום ומחר, “today and&nbsp;tomorrow.” (verse 10). G’d had referred to the Wednesday&nbsp;and Thursday, whereas Moses added Friday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the opinion that the letter ל in the word: לשלושת in verse 15 is superfluous, just as the letter ל in&nbsp;Exodus 14,28 is superfluous in the phrase: לכל חיל פרעה, and&nbsp;just as the letter ל is superfluous in Exodus 27,3 in the&nbsp;phrase לכל כליו תעשה נחושת, G’d ordered the people to&nbsp;prepare for three whole days as explained by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> When&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> wrote: “at the end of three days, i.e. the fourth day,”&nbsp;this refers to Wednesday when Moses still stood on Mount&nbsp;Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בהיות הבקר, “</span><span class="font5">during the early hours of the morning;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> G’d put in an appearance before the&nbsp;Israelites did, although, normally, the students assemble&nbsp;before the teacher arrives, in this instance G’d did so for their&nbsp;sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחרד כל העם, </span><span class="font5">in this instance the root חרד does not mean that the people were afraid, but the meaning is similar to&nbsp;Samuel I 14,15: המצב והמשחית </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">חרדו</span><span class="font5">, “the garrison and the&nbsp;spoilers also </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">made</span><span class="font5"> a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">commotion</span><span class="font5">.” See also Samuel I 13,7:&nbsp;וכל העם </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">חרדו</span><span class="font5"> אחריו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">and all the people </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">rallied</span><span class="font5"> to him.” Seeing&nbsp;that the people while still in their beds, heard the commotion&nbsp;outside, they rallied to their appointed positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,17.ויוצא משה את העם</span><span class="font5">, “Moses brought forth the people;” some commentators claim that Moses brought them&nbsp;forth because without his urging they were too scared to&nbsp;come forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויתיצבו בתחתית ההר, </span><span class="font5">“they took up a position at the base of the Mountain” due to the lightning and thunder. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here&nbsp;writes that G’d threatened to bring down the Mountain upon&nbsp;them. This sounds strange, as they had already expressed&nbsp;their willingness to accept the Torah without examining what&nbsp;is written therein. [Exodus 24,7, that whole chapter describes&nbsp;events prior to the revelation Ed.] We would have to&nbsp;understand this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> as referring to the Israelites accepting&nbsp;the oral Torah which they had not yet accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;משה ידבר</span><span class="font5">, “Moses would be speaking,” he would&nbsp;be speaking with G’d, but his voice could not be heard&nbsp;except by G’d. This is why the Torah writes that G’d&nbsp;answered him in a loud voice. This was also because the&nbsp;sound of the blasts from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar</span><span class="font5"> which are described as&nbsp;loud, would have to be overpowered by G’d’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על הר סיני, “</span><span class="font5">on Mount Sinai.” The reason why the&nbsp;Torah was not given to the people in the land of Israel was&nbsp;so as not to give us a pretext to claim that since this law was&nbsp;given in the land of Israel, gentiles had no share in it [refusal&nbsp;to accept converts. Based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Talkut Shimoni Yitro</span><span class="font5"> paragraph&nbsp;275. The edition I own was printed over 300 years ago in&nbsp;Amsterdam. Ed.] Our author quotes the same Yalkut as&nbsp;saying almost the reverse, i.e. that if the Torah had been&nbsp;given in the land of Israel, they could claim that this was the&nbsp;reason that it was not addressed to them and they were not&nbsp;morally bound by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: If the Torah had been given to the Israelites when they were in the land of Israel, this would&nbsp;have resulted in jealousy between the different tribes. Each&nbsp;one would have claimed that it had been given in his part of&nbsp;the country. It is significant that the word: סין, when it appears&nbsp;in Scripture (16,1) was changed to סיני, Sinai, The implication&nbsp;is that something that had been the cause of strife,&nbsp;negatively, was changed after the Ten Commandments, had&nbsp;been given, i.e. “My strife,” constructive competition, (in&nbsp;fulfilling My commandments.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,22. וגם הכהנים וגו</span><span class="font5">׳, “and also the priests, etc.” who were these “priests?” They were the seventy elders who are&nbsp;all firstborns at the same time. (compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> on בחדש&nbsp;הזה Exodus chapter 12). [Seeing that at this time the tribe of&nbsp;Levi had not yet been chosen to replace the functions of the&nbsp;firstborns. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יתקדשו</span><span class="font5">, “shall become sanctified;” they shall be warned to be prepared for this, and shall not say: “seeing that we are&nbsp;already appointed to perform the priestly functions, we do not&nbsp;need to undergo an additional process of sanctification.”&nbsp;They shall not presume on their familiarity with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הנגשים אל ה</span><span class="font5">׳, the Torah underlines that precisely the people appointed as priests need to be the first to sanctify&nbsp;themselves instead of presuming on their superiority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of this verse: Who is meant by the word: הנהנים, the people’s elite, the nobility, and the&nbsp;judges. Based on the verse in Deuteronomy 1,17, ני המשפט&nbsp;לאלוקים הוא, “that ultimately true justice is reserved for G’d,”&nbsp;i.e. that if the judges err, justice will still be done, these&nbsp;judges are not ever to lose sight of this by acting superior. In&nbsp;this instance, they might have argued that they are busy&nbsp;studying the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachot</span><span class="font5"> Moses had taught them in order to&nbsp;carry out the judicial duties, i.e. being busy with one&nbsp;commandment frees you from the need to perform another&nbsp;commandment at that time; [that argument is true only when&nbsp;due to time limitations on the performance of both&nbsp;commandment they conflict with one another. Ed.] It is&nbsp;impossible to accept the word: כהנים in the accepted meaning&nbsp;as there were not yet any </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kohanim</span><span class="font5"> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,24. ויאמר אליו ה' לך רד</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> said to him: “go and descend, etc.” If you were to ask why was there any need for&nbsp;three separate warnings (verse 12, verse 21 and this verse)?&nbsp;The warning in verse 23 refers to the warning in verse 21&nbsp;where G’d had warned the people not to approach the&nbsp;mountain in order not to become a victim of destruction by&nbsp;trying to have a visual image of G’d. Moses had assumed&nbsp;that the very fact that they had been warned would be&nbsp;equivalent to the people’s inability to violate G’d’s&nbsp;commandment. G’d had already said in verse 12 that the&nbsp;people would be immediately killed if they were to try and&nbsp;ascend the Mountain or even its lower edge. Surely they&nbsp;could exercise control over their feet! Concerning their&nbsp;having control over their eyes, not to try and see the glory of&nbsp;G’d was a much more difficult task. This is why the warning&nbsp;had to be repeated. They would think that it was a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">good</span><span class="font5"> deed&nbsp;to try and catch a glimpse of their King! Moses had&nbsp;misinterpreted the prohibition as applying only to a physical&nbsp;ascent of the Mountain. This is why G’d had to add that not&nbsp;only ascent was potentially fatal, but even touching the base&nbsp;of the Mountain and even trying to catch a glimpse of G’d’s&nbsp;Majesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואהרן עמך</span><span class="font5">, “and Aaron with you;” he was allowed to accompany Moses part of the way to the base of the&nbsp;Mountain. Moses was going to explain to the people the last&nbsp;nine of the Ten Commandments, starting with the words: לא&nbsp;יהיה לך, “You must not have, etc.” which the people had not&nbsp;heard or understood clearly from G’d’s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another way of interpreting G’d’s instructions here: G’d told Moses to descend in order that the people and the&nbsp;priests would not be under the mistaken impression that&nbsp;Aaron was no better than they as they had all been forbidden&nbsp;to ascend or even begin to ascend the Mountain. By being&nbsp;allowed to accompany Moses far closer to the Mountain than&nbsp;they had been, it became clear to them that Aaron was on a&nbsp;higher spiritual level than they. To prevent the people from&nbsp;thinking that Aaron could ascend all the way G’d told Moses&nbsp;to descend before Aaron could do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,25.ויאמר אליהם</span><span class="font5">, “he (Moses) said to them,” that only he and Aaron had been given permission to proceed further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,1. וידבר אלוקים את כל הדברים האלה</span><span class="font5">, The reason for this introduction is that the Torah wishes to show that G’d&nbsp;organises His words just as human beings organise their&nbsp;words prior to expressing them to outsiders. Hence: “G’d&nbsp;spoke all these words:”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word: וידבר here is to indicate that G’d said these words to Himself, in a preparatory manner; subsequently, the&nbsp;word: לאמור, refers to the final draft of this address by G’d to&nbsp;the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I am the Lord your G’d;” this is what Job meant when he said: (Job 28,27-28) אז ראה ויספרה, הכינה וגם הקרה ויאמר&nbsp;לאדם, “then He saw and gauged it; He measured it and&nbsp;probed it and said to man etc.:” the Torah teaches you what&nbsp;are good manners, i.e. that even if you are an erudite scholar&nbsp;do not be arrogant enough when facing a crowd until after&nbsp;you have weighed carefully every word that you are going to&nbsp;say. You will do well to practice what you are going to say&nbsp;two or three times before actually addressing your words to&nbsp;an assembly of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It happened once to Rabbi Akiva in a synagogue </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Tanchuma</span><span class="font5"> item 15 on our verse) that the sages called upon&nbsp;him to read publicly from the Torah scroll, i.e. to accept an&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aliyah.</span><span class="font5"> He declined the honour. When his students asked him&nbsp;why he had declined, quoting that he had taught them a&nbsp;verse in Deuteronomy 30,20, according to which reading&nbsp;from the Torah in public is one of the highest achievements&nbsp;in your life, so how could he refuse such a request? He&nbsp;answered them that indeed this was so, but that he had&nbsp;declined to do so as he had not previously reviewed this&nbsp;particular portion and it would be an insult to the&nbsp;congregation to presume to read to them unprepared as he&nbsp;had been. He should have first gone over that text at least&nbsp;two or three times. He quoted our verse from the Torah as&nbsp;the source of his reticence. If Gd had not addressed the&nbsp;Jewish people before having marshaled His thoughts first,&nbsp;how could he permit himself to do less?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את כל הדברים האלה</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> G’d uttered all these words as a single utterance, something no human&nbsp;being is able to do. If so, why did He repeat the first two&nbsp;commandments a second time? The second time He spelled&nbsp;out each of these commandments separately word by word.&nbsp;This explains why the first two commandments were written&nbsp;in direct speech whereas parts of the remainder were written&nbsp;in indirect speech. The Israelites found it too overwhelming to&nbsp;have to listen to all of this without collapsing, and this is why&nbsp;they interrupted by asking Moses to act as their go between,&nbsp;as related by Moses in verse 16. They had been literally&nbsp;afraid of dying before hearing the end of the commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi</span><span class="font5"> bases himself on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> on our portion) According to the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Makkot</span><span class="font5"> folio,24, the last&nbsp;8 commandments were each addressed to the Israelites one&nbsp;by one and relayed to the people by Moses. This is hinted at&nbsp;by the numerical value of the letters in the word תורה in the&nbsp;line: תורה צוה לנו משה, “Moses commanded the Torah to us.”&nbsp;The combined numerical value of the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah</span><span class="font5"> is 611, the&nbsp;other two commandments of the 613 commandments had&nbsp;been communicated to the people by G’d directly, without an&nbsp;interpreter. This interpretation seems reasonable as a close&nbsp;look at the first two commandments creates the impression&nbsp;that the author was speaking about Himself, as opposed to&nbsp;the third and fourth commandment which sound as if the&nbsp;author is addressing an audience, although referring to&nbsp;Himself in the third person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary, all of the commandments were spoken twice, once by G’d and once&nbsp;by Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,2. אנכי ה' אלוקיך, </span><span class="font5">“I am the Lord your G’d;” Rabbi Levi is quoted as saying (old version of Tanchuma Yitro 17) G’d&nbsp;appeared to the Israelites as if a multifaceted portrait visible&nbsp;to a thousand people at the same time (by means of&nbsp;refraction) so that all could see Him and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people each </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">heard</span><span class="font5"> His voice in a similar manner [as of course a visual image was out of the question since&nbsp;even if they had seen one that would be proof that it could&nbsp;not be His “face.” Ed.]. In this way every Israelite was able to&nbsp;claim that G’d had spoken to him individually, saying: “I am&nbsp;the Lord </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> G’d, etc. This is the reason that G’d had not&nbsp;said: אלוקיכם “your G’d (plural mode,)” but אלוקיך, “your G’d,&nbsp;(singular mode)”. He had addressed all of them in the order&nbsp;in which they stood assembled around the Mountain. This&nbsp;corresponded exactly to G’d’s commandment to Moses in&nbsp;19,12: והגבלת את העם סביב לאמור, “you are to set bounds to the&nbsp;people around, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do not raise the question that if the people had been used already to receive their daily ration of manna by picking&nbsp;it up around the boundaries of the encampment, and in spite&nbsp;of each one receiving the same amount, its taste would vary&nbsp;in accordance with the imagination of its recipient, then each&nbsp;one would presumably have a different recollection of how&nbsp;G’d’s voice had sounded to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">*ה' אלוקין</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord your G’d,” (two separate attributes of G’d) the author refers the reader to his commentary on&nbsp;Genesis 1,1 where he had pointed out that the “plural”&nbsp;ending in the word אלוהים, is not a plural ending at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">*אנכי ה' אלוקין</span><span class="font5">, this is the beginning of the first of the ten Commandments. By means of this declaration G’d&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">commands</span><span class="font5"> the people never to forget that is was He Who&nbsp;had redeemed the people by taking them out of bondage in&nbsp;Egypt. As a result, He had now become their new Master. He&nbsp;implies that they are far better off serving Him than remaining&nbsp;slaves to Pharaoh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר הוצאתיך</span><span class="font5">, “Who has taken you out;” why did G’d choose this activity when He could have said: “I have made&nbsp;you,” or “I have created you?” He could have listed any&nbsp;number of favours that He had performed for the Jewish&nbsp;people already. Each one have them would have established&nbsp;His claim to be their Master and to obey Him. The answer is&nbsp;simple; they would have replied that G’d had performed&nbsp;deeds of loving kindness for the other nations also without&nbsp;requiring them to accept His Torah as a result. The one He&nbsp;listed here He had not performed for anyone else, however.&nbsp;By listing the Exodus as His claim to become their Master,&nbsp;He forestalled any such replies by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,3. לא יהיה לך</span><span class="font5">, “You must not retain for yourselves;” do not say that you will serve Me as well as other deities.&nbsp;Seeing that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> I took you out of Egypt </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;assistance of any other powers, it is clear that no other deity&nbsp;deserves your respect. Besides, they are useless even if&nbsp;they had attempted to help you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלהים </span><span class="font5">אחרים, “other deities,” This translation is incorrect. The correct translation is: “deities worshipped by others.” If&nbsp;they are so useless why do they have the title: “deity?”&nbsp;According to Rabbi Yossi in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> chapter 6 on this&nbsp;verse, (a dissenting voice there) explains the need for G’d to&nbsp;say: לא יהיה לכם אלוהים אחרים, as follows: He said it so that the&nbsp;gentiles would not have a pretext to say that if these “deities”&nbsp;had been called by their individual names in the Torah,&nbsp;instead of simply “non gods,” this would be proof that G’d&nbsp;had had need of them for some purpose at some time. There&nbsp;had indeed been a time when </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font5"> had referred to such&nbsp;“deities” by the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> title as G’d; this happened during the&nbsp;generation of Enosh, a grandson of Adam, when the Torah in&nbsp;Genesis 4,26, reported: 'אז הוחל לקרא בשם ה, “at that time&nbsp;some people called (other forces) by the name that had been&nbsp;reserved until then for G’d.” When that happened, one third&nbsp;of the earth’s landmass was flooded by the oceans rising. [a&nbsp;mini-deluge as a warning to mankind. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחרים</span><span class="font5">, according to Rabbi Eliezer, in the same paragraph of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta,</span><span class="font5"> the expression </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim acheyrim&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">means that they coined new names for new deities&nbsp;constantly, i.e. when one proved impotent, they exchanged it&nbsp;for another. If a deity made of gold had proved worthless&nbsp;they substituted one made of silver. He derives this from&nbsp;when Moses said in Deuteronomy 32,17: חדשים מקרוב באו,&nbsp;“new ones, which had come into existence only lately.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא יהיה לך אלוהים אחרים</span><span class="font5">, “you will have no authority over you other than Mine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על פני</span><span class="font5">, “in My place;” we find a similar use of this expression in Deuteronomy 21,16: על פני בן השנואה, where the&nbsp;Torah forbids to treat the firstborn son of a beloved wife, that&nbsp;has been born later than the firstborn son of a less beloved&nbsp;wife, preferentially. In other words, as long as the firstborn&nbsp;son of the less beloved wife is alive, his claim to be treated&nbsp;as the firstborn of the father cannot be overruled. We also&nbsp;have this expression when after the death of the two oldest&nbsp;sons of Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, his sons Elazar and Ittamar&nbsp;were appointed as priests in their stead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: “If you were to accept any of these deities as your gods this would be against My express&nbsp;wishes and would arouse My anger against you.” An&nbsp;example of a similar construction would be: חמס ושוד ישמע על&nbsp;פני, “before Me constantly are grief and wounds.” Or: ,אם לא&nbsp;אל פניך יברכך</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">if not he will curse you to your face.” (Job 2,5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תעשה לך פסל וכל תמונה</span><span class="font5">, “do not make for yourself&nbsp;a sculptured image or any likeness (of what is in heaven&nbsp;above or on earth below)” In Deuteronomy 4,15 the Torah&nbsp;supplies the reason for this prohibition when we read: “for&nbsp;you have not seen any likeness (at the revelation)”. You&nbsp;should not be able to say that I am a G’d Who hides Himself,&nbsp;and since no one can see You I am forced to make for&nbsp;myself an image in order to constantly remind myself of You&nbsp;and to prostrate myself before Your image instead, in Your&nbsp;honour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל תמונה</span><span class="font5">, “nor any likeness;” the prefix letter ו seems unnecessary; it is meant to mean: “do not make for yourself a&nbsp;sculptured image of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font5">likeness, even if it is only the face of&nbsp;that creature. Since the reason of making such artwork is to&nbsp;use it as a symbol of G’d, it is idolatrous by definition. You&nbsp;must not even make sculptured images of a widow or&nbsp;orphan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תשתחוה להם</span><span class="font5">, “neither must you prostrate&nbsp;yourself before them even if they are not yours and have&nbsp;been made by others.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אנכי ה' אלוקיך</span><span class="font5">, “for I am the Lord your G’d;” seeing that you have a benign Master, you have no need to turn to idols.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">א-ל קנא</span><span class="font5">, “a philosopher asked Rabbi Yehudi Hanassi since when a superior individual demeans himself by being&nbsp;jealous of someone way below him physically and mentally.&nbsp;The Rabbi answered him if he thought it appropriate that&nbsp;someone should call his dog by the same name as himself?&nbsp;Does it not make sense that he should be angry of being&nbsp;compared to a dog? The philosopher was forced to agree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פוקד עון אבות, </span><span class="font5">“who remembers the sin of the fathers, etc;” G’d explains that He must demonstrate that He cannot&nbsp;simply “forget” the sins of the fathers, even if He delayed&nbsp;punishment for good reasons. This statement does not mean&nbsp;that the children will be taken to task for their father’s sins,&nbsp;seeing that the principle of each person is executed on&nbsp;account of his own sins not because of the sins of his&nbsp;fathers. (Kings II 14,6) This attribute of G’d must be&nbsp;understood as follows: when a person sins, G’d is apt to&nbsp;delay punishment to give the sinner an opportunity to&nbsp;become a penitent and to therefore rehabilitate himself. G’d’s&nbsp;patience may extend beyond the lifetime of the sinner and&nbsp;even the sinner’s son and grandson. If during these years the&nbsp;descendants of the original sinner have not mended their&nbsp;ways but continue to sin, G’d has to punish the great&nbsp;grandson for his own sins immediately, so that He will not be&nbsp;viewed as “forgetting” the original sin. He does so by&nbsp;removing that fourth generation of sinners from the world. He&nbsp;does so </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> when these generations successively have all&nbsp;been unrepentant sinners. He relates to such “sinners” in this&nbsp;fashion only if they do not sin inadvertently but “hate” Him&nbsp;and His laws,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לשונאי, </span><span class="font5">to those who hate “Me.” Having said this we might think that G’d operates in a similar fashion in delaying&nbsp;rewards for those who have lived exemplary lives; He&nbsp;therefore assures us that on the contrary, His memory of&nbsp;meritorious deeds performed by the fathers will be taken into&nbsp;consideration of the treatment of their children and children’s&nbsp;children for up to two thousand generations. He adds the&nbsp;words: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאלף דור, </span><span class="font5">“for as long as a thousand generations,” i.e.&nbsp;forever. (Compare Deuteronomy 7,9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לאוהבי</span><span class="font5">, “to those who love Me.” This is a reference&nbsp;to the category of Jews known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“chassidim”</span><span class="font5"> by their fellow&nbsp;Jews. [These are people who excel in their piety. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולשומרי מצותי, </span><span class="font5">“and to the ones who are observe My commandments;” [the Jews who are careful not to violate&nbsp;any of My negative commandments; the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzaddikim.”</span><span class="font5"> Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תשא את שם</span><span class="font5">, “do not utter the sacred name, etc.”&nbsp;Seeing that you have not ever seen a visual image of G’d,&nbsp;you can obviously not utter an oath by invoking someone&nbsp;else as a deity. Even so, you must not even swear an oath in&nbsp;His name unless there is an absolute necessity to do so, as&nbsp;G’d does not allow His sacred name to be used for profane&nbsp;reasons, or for secular purposes. This is one sin which will&nbsp;not be subject to being wiped out even by repentance, i.e. כי&nbsp;לא ינקה, “He will not consider such a person as being free&nbsp;from guilt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לשוא</span><span class="font5">, “in vain.” Do not make a habit of prefacing any parts of your speech by invoking the name of G’d (unless as&nbsp;a pseudonym), even if what you say is the truth. The very&nbsp;habit of uttering G’d’s name on too many occasions will lead&nbsp;you to do so when it is a blasphemy, or an outright lie. If that&nbsp;were to happen it would result in an unforgivable sin, i.e. כי&nbsp;לא ינקה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,8. זכור את יום השבת</span><span class="font5">, “remember the Sabbath day;” this commandment begins with an infinitive, “to remember;” the&nbsp;reason is because it is a day which should dominate your&nbsp;thinking throughout the week, seeing it is the most important&nbsp;day of the week. Also, the other six days of the week during&nbsp;which you are preoccupied with matters concerning your&nbsp;livelihood are not likely to be “forgotten,” as opposed to the&nbsp;Sabbath, the day of rest. Seeing that it is the spiritual&nbsp;highlight of your week and has been sanctified by G’d, it&nbsp;deserves special attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression: ”to remember,” as opposed to the ”planning” of the six days to follow, is always something that&nbsp;is concerned with the past, one remembers things that have&nbsp;already passed, not things that are to come. [as opposed to&nbsp;the way we use the word in our daily language. Ed] In the&nbsp;second version of the Ten Commandments in Deuteronomy,&nbsp;the word in the written text is replaced by the word: שמור, as&nbsp;there it is connected to the purpose of the day, to provide&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">constructive</span><span class="font5"> rest, למען ינוח, both for yourselves and for your&nbsp;servants and beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the line זכור את יום השבת “remembering the Sabbath day” is aimed at reminding you of&nbsp;the first time you heard about the concept of the Sabbath at&nbsp;Marah (Exodus 15,25). This is why the word: “remember” is&nbsp;appropriate. Still another exegesis of the infinitive used here&nbsp;is that this day must be remembered </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font5"> day of the week,&nbsp;and that is why when describing each day of the week, i.e.&nbsp;naming it, we always do so in relation to the previous</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sabbath, i.e. “the first day after the Sabbath, the second day after the Sabbath, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another approach: the words: זכור את יום השבת in the infinitive mean that you are to be mindful of the Sabbath day&nbsp;at all times, i.e. you should remember each day when the last&nbsp;Sabbath occurred and when therefore the next Sabbath&nbsp;occurs. The reason that you have to do this is so that when&nbsp;the next Sabbath occurs you will not forget it, not fail to&nbsp;observe its commandments. When you understand the line&nbsp;of זכור את יום השבת לקדשו, “keep on </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">remembering</span><span class="font5"> the Sabbath&nbsp;day to observe it as a holy day,” it is practically the same as&nbsp;when it says in the second version of the Ten&nbsp;Commandments: “make sure you </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">observe</span><span class="font5"> the Sabbath day&nbsp;to keep it holy, i.e. שמור את יום השבת לקדשו. This is what the&nbsp;rabbis meant when they said that the two words were spoken&nbsp;by G’d simultaneously, although we human beings cannot&nbsp;duplicate this exactly. This is what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> meant to tell us in&nbsp;his commentary. In our portion the commandment is phrased&nbsp;as a positive commandment, while in the Book of&nbsp;Deuteronomy it is phrased as a negative commandment,&nbsp;warning us not to violate the prohibitions applicable on that&nbsp;day. Our sages spelled this out in the Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eyruvin</span><span class="font5"> 96.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a rule in the written Torah that whenever the expression השמר פן, or אל, occurs in the Torah, this introduces&nbsp;a negative commandment to be careful not to do something,&nbsp;It also includes women as being included in that prohibition.&nbsp;In other words, anyone to whom the warning of שמור is&nbsp;addressed, is automatically included in a commandment&nbsp;which is elsewhere expressed by the positive aspect of that&nbsp;commandment described by the word זכור.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,9. ועשית כל מלאכתך</span><span class="font5">, “and you may (or must) go about all your weekday activities;” our author does not understand&nbsp;the word: כל in our verse as literally “all” or “every,” but as a&nbsp;euphemism for “part of all your activities,” as for instance in&nbsp;the expression: כל מגפותי, “usually translated as “all My&nbsp;plagues,” which we all know was not meant to mean: “all the&nbsp;plagues at G’d’s disposal.” (Compare Exodus 9,14,) and&nbsp;numerous similar occasions when such an expression is&nbsp;used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שבת לה׳ אלוקיך</span><span class="font5">, “as a Sabbath for the Lord your&nbsp;G’d;” and not for </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">you;</span><span class="font5"> in other words, during the preceding six&nbsp;days you pursue your own agenda; on the Sabbath, seeing&nbsp;that you are relieved of having to pursue your own agenda, I&nbsp;expect you to pursue My agenda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תעשה כל מלאכה</span><span class="font5">, “do not perform any work of a purely secular nature. The meaning of the word כל in this verse is&nbsp;the same as in the expression לא תעשה כל תמונה, in verse 4, or&nbsp;as in Exodus 22,21: כל אלמנה ויתום, i.e. “any widow or&nbsp;orphan.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועבדך ואמתך</span><span class="font5">, “nor your male or female slave.” Seeing that the Torah here does not spell out here the reason or purpose&nbsp;for this prohibition, this has been spelled out in Deuteronomy&nbsp;5,15 where the Ten Commandments have been repeated,&nbsp;i.e. in order to contrast this day with your status in Egypt&nbsp;when you were slaves and never had a day of rest from&nbsp;menial work. It is the lawgiver of this commandment who&nbsp;redeemed you from that status.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ששת ימים עשה</span><span class="font5">, “during the six days of creation&nbsp;preceding the Sabbath of creation, G’d had created the six&nbsp;directions of the spatial universe, i.e. north, south, east, west,&nbsp;up and down. What had He left for you to complete, seeing&nbsp;that He had done it all? This verse is a reminder that there&nbsp;had been nothing left for the Creator to do on that day and&nbsp;that we are to emulate Him as a reminder of this. Just as He&nbsp;had looked at His completed universe, so we are to look at&nbsp;having completed our secular tasks during the preceding six&nbsp;days, before turning to the six days following and the tasks&nbsp;awaiting us then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כבד את אביך</span><span class="font5">, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Honour</span><span class="font5"> your father;” elsewhere we&nbsp;have a more detailed formulation of what is meant by&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">honouring</span><span class="font5">” our parents, i.e. when Solomon spelled this out&nbsp;in Proverbs 3,9 saying: כבד את ה׳ מהונך, “honour the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> with&nbsp;(part) of your wealth; all G’d asks of us is a small part of the&nbsp;wealth He has granted us, not all of it. We are to emulate&nbsp;Him in our relations with our parents, our progenitors on this&nbsp;earth. In Leviticus, another aspect of our relationship with our&nbsp;parents has been legislated when the Torah writes in&nbsp;Leviticus 19,3 as the first commandment after bidding us to&nbsp;try and become holy ourselves, that we are to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">revere</span><span class="font5"> our&nbsp;parents. When the Torah there continues with repeating the&nbsp;requirement to observe the negative commandments of His&nbsp;Sabbath, it hints at the definition of “reverence” being not to&nbsp;disregard our parents’ instructions. The Torah decrees the&nbsp;death penalty for anyone who curses father or mother&nbsp;(Exodus 21,17) a penalty similar to that decreed for cursing&nbsp;G’d, (using a euphemism, which is difficult to warn him not to&nbsp;use in this fashion) (Leviticus 24,15) (which because not&nbsp;carried out by human tribunal makes that sin practically&nbsp;unforgivable so that the penalty will be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">karet,</span><span class="font5"> posthumous&nbsp;disbarment as member of the Jewish people.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The death penalty for cursing parents is completely natural, as when cursing one’s parents one automatically&nbsp;curses G’d also, as He is one third partner in any human&nbsp;being, having supplied the soul. (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kidushin</span><span class="font5"> folio 30)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר ה׳ אלוקיך נותן לך</span><span class="font5">, which the Lord your G’d is giving you (the soil).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[The following </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> appears in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessikta</span><span class="font5"> de Rav Kahane chapter 21 on the Ten Commandments, but there&nbsp;the Roman is not Turnusrufus, but the Emperor Hadrianus. In&nbsp;my edition, (Mandelbaum) I have not found it. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wicked Roman governor Turnusrufus asked Rabbi Akiva why the name of the Lord is mentioned seven times in&nbsp;the first five of the Ten Commandments, while His name&nbsp;does not appear even a single time in the last five of these&nbsp;Commandments? Thereupon Rabbi Akiva went to the palace&nbsp;of Turnusrufus and showed him his lance. The next time he&nbsp;went to the palace he showed Turnusrufus his shield. The&nbsp;next time he showed his armour and his various weapons.&nbsp;When he visited him again and came to his toilet, he found&nbsp;that there was no weapon or defensive shield. Upon asking&nbsp;why this was so, he was told that the Emperor considered it&nbsp;as disgraceful to bring his weapons, etc. to such a place.&nbsp;Thereupon Rabbi Akiva answered him that in the first five of&nbsp;the Ten Commandments the subjects are all sacred or at&nbsp;least honorable. In the second half of the Ten&nbsp;Commandments where the subjects are murder, theft,&nbsp;adultery, perjury, and man’s basic carnal urges, it would not&nbsp;be appropriate that the name of G’d would appear there as if&nbsp;He associated Himself with people guilty of such crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation regarding the presence of G’d’s name in the last five of the Ten Commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Violation of any of the first five Commandments means sinning against a Being that is infinite, eternal, is permanent,&nbsp;When someone violated one or more of the last five&nbsp;Commandments he only sinned against transient creatures.&nbsp;G’d’s name therefore did not need to be mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תרצח</span><span class="font5">, “do not murder!” The absence of any&nbsp;qualifying adjectives or adverbs means that murder by hand,&nbsp;by tool, or even by silence is equally forbidden. Example: you&nbsp;have obtained information that someone is about to be&nbsp;murdered and you fail to warn the prospective victim. The&nbsp;expression רצח is not applicable unless applied to death&nbsp;caused by illegal means. The expressions מיתה, or הריגה can&nbsp;be applied to death by other means whether legal or illegal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תנאף</span><span class="font5">, “do not commit adultery!” Do not argue that whereas it is forbidden to reduce the number of living human&nbsp;beings through murder, there is nothing wrong with&nbsp;increasing the human population even through sleeping with&nbsp;a woman who is someone else’s wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תחמוד אשת רעך</span><span class="font5">, “Do not lust after your fellow&nbsp;man’s wife!” Do not scheme to how bring about her divorce&nbsp;so that you can marry her. The translation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lo tachmod&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">cannot be that you shall not kidnap her are otherwise force&nbsp;her to sleep with you. This prohibition was already included&nbsp;in the prohibition to commit adultery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first five commandments were all in the category of לא מבעיא, there being no question of their being necessary.&nbsp;The need to accept G’d as Israel’s Master hardly had to be&nbsp;spelled out. Neither did the commandment not to worship&nbsp;competing deities or the need not to swear an oath by any&nbsp;other deity, or to observe the Sabbath, seeing that G’d&nbsp;Himself had observed a Sabbath; nor was there a need to&nbsp;decree to honour one’s parents. Every gentile does so&nbsp;without having been ordered to do so by G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even the last five of the Ten Commandments did not need to be legislated as universal disregard of either of these&nbsp;commandments results in complete anarchy and the&nbsp;destruction of the human race by itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In most of the Ten Commandments we find two cantillation marks per word (as opposed to only one on a&nbsp;word.). The symbolism that is represented by that fact is a&nbsp;reminder that we have two versions of the Ten&nbsp;Commandments in the written Torah. When the Torah is&nbsp;read in public on the festival of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot,</span><span class="font5"> which is the&nbsp;anniversary of the revelation on Mount Sinai, we read the&nbsp;second commandment לא יהיה לך as well as the whole&nbsp;commandment commencing with the word: זכור using the&nbsp;major cantillation marks in order that each one of them be&nbsp;understood as a single verse. The 6<sup>th</sup>-9<sup>th</sup> commandments are&nbsp;read on </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font5"> occasion by using the minor cantillation marks,&nbsp;in order to understand them as separate verses. The reason&nbsp;is that although we never find a verse that has only two&nbsp;words, in this instance the Rabbis decided to remind us that&nbsp;we are dealing here with separate commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Torah is read on an </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ordinary</span><span class="font5"> Sabbath in the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’vat,</span><span class="font5"> however, and the Ten Commandments are&nbsp;read as part of the portion known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yitro,</span><span class="font5"> we read the entire&nbsp;Ten Commandments using the minor cantillation marks as a&nbsp;result of which we make four verses of each one of them.&nbsp;The reason why on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot</span><span class="font5"> we read the first and second&nbsp;commandment with the major cantillation marks is to remind&nbsp;us that they were uttered by G’d as a single continuous&nbsp;verse. [The author had explained there that these two&nbsp;Commandments were heard by all of the people from G’d’s&nbsp;mouth without Moses acting as an interpreter. Ed.] [In the&nbsp;second version of the Ten Commandments where the 7th<sup>h</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> commandments are linked to one another by the prefix&nbsp;letter ו, it is clear that they are to be treated as separate&nbsp;commandments each. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[The author proceeds to spell this out in greater detail. Readers familiar with the significance of each cantillation&nbsp;mark will be able to check this themselves. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,15. וכל הע</span><span class="font5">ם, “And all the people;” from here on as far&nbsp;as verse 23, לא תגלה ערותך עליו, “you must not reveal your&nbsp;nakedness while on it (the altar),” the sequence of the way in&nbsp;which the Torah has been written is unusual, as the words:&nbsp;ולשומרי מצותיו, “and to those who observe His&nbsp;Commandments,” should have appeared at the end of verse&nbsp;6. The reason why they do not appear at that point is in order&nbsp;not to interrupt the sequence of the Ten Commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">רואים את הקולות, </span><span class="font5">“were seeing a visual image of the thunder.” The plain meaning of the verse is that even&nbsp;phenomena normally not subject to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">being seen,</span><span class="font5"> had become&nbsp;visible during the revelation. [In our time: “sound waves had&nbsp;become visible to the naked eye.” Ed.] Kohelet 7,27 already&nbsp;used the verb ראה “to see,” when he said: “see this is what I&nbsp;have found;” he referred to something that no one else&nbsp;before him had been able to find, (with his eyes). Or,&nbsp;compare Exodus 32,1 וירא העם כי בושש משה, “the people </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">saw&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">that Moses was tarrying.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.20,16.דבר אתה עמנו ונשמעה</span><span class="font5">, “you speak with us and we will listen (obey)” They said this as they were afraid of the&nbsp;thunder and lightning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.19. אתם ראיתם כי מן השמים דברתי עמכם</span><span class="font5">, “You have seen that I spoke with you from the heavens. G’d points out&nbsp;that although He spoke to them from the heavens they still&nbsp;did not see any image of His glory. Moses makes that same&nbsp;point again in Deuteronomy 4,15, where he relates what&nbsp;transpired at Mount Sinai to the new generation. Seeing that&nbsp;this is so, you are also not to make an image symbolising&nbsp;Me, as you never saw an </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">original</span><span class="font5"> that you could have made&nbsp;a copy of. Even if you were to use precious metals such as&nbsp;silver and gold, this would not do justice to Me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תעשון אתי</span><span class="font5">, “you are not to make in addition to&nbsp;Me.” (some kind of symbol out of either silver or gold)” in&nbsp;verse 4 the pronoun לך, “for yourself,” had followed this&nbsp;commandment, whereas here the pronoun אתי is used. If you&nbsp;were to ask how you could possibly serve Me in practice&nbsp;when all these restrictions apply, the answer is that I require&nbsp;only a simple earthen altar upon which you can present your&nbsp;offerings to Me. Slaughtering the appropriate animals on&nbsp;such a structure is all that is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מזבח אדמה</span><span class="font5">, “an altar of earth which does not lend&nbsp;itself to carve images upon, is what you should erect for Me;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וזבחת עליו</span><span class="font5">, “you will slaughter upon it;” not literally upon it, but “thereby;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את עולותיך ואת שלומיך</span><span class="font5">, “your burnt offerings and your peace-offerings;” the burnt offering must be presented on the&nbsp;northern section of the altar and the peace-offerings on its&nbsp;southern section. Whence do I know that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> the northern&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">half</span><span class="font5"> of the altar is suitable for the performance of these&nbsp;presentations? We derive this from Leviticus 14,13: ושחט את&nbsp;הכבש במקום אשר ישחט את החטאת ואת העולה, “he is to slaughter&nbsp;the sheep on the place where he will slaughter the burnt&nbsp;offering and the sin-offering.” (Compare </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta&nbsp;“bachodesh”</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">chapter 11) What precisely did the Torah mean&nbsp;when writing: במקום הקדש, “on the place that is sanctified?”&nbsp;These words are to teach that any part of the altar‘s surface&nbsp;that is in the northern section of it is acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וזבחת עליו</span><span class="font5">, “you are to slaughter upon it” Why are these words necessary? To teach that even an ordinary Israelite,&nbsp;not only a priest, may perform that part of the service, as we&nbsp;accept the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">principle</span><span class="font5"> that the act of slaughtering an animal&nbsp;sacrifice is acceptable even when performed_by a non priest.&nbsp;(Talmud tractate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">folio 31.) Any step commencing&nbsp;with the placing of the animal’s blood into a special&nbsp;receptacle is reserved for the priests, According to the&nbsp;Talmud in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">folio 27, non priests were allowed on the&nbsp;area immediately surrounding the altar. [We are speaking of&nbsp;the copper altar situated outside the Temple building. Ed.] In&nbsp;the Talmud </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkah, 45,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">it is stated specifically that on the&nbsp;festival of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">the people at large walked around that&nbsp;altar carrying their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">aravot</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> willow branches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בכל המקום</span><span class="font5">, “on any place,” seeing that the Tabernacle, after the Israelites had crossed the river Jordan was to stand&nbsp;at different periods in Gilgal, Shiloh, Nov and Giveon, before&nbsp;being moved to Jerusalem, we know that the presence of&nbsp;G’d’s glory was not limited to a single area in the Holy Land.&nbsp;From the above words the sages derived this principle, as&nbsp;the Torah did not bother to spell out the names of any&nbsp;specific place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,22. ואם מזבח אבנים</span><span class="font5">, “And if an altar made of stones, etc.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">comments on these words, (quoting Rabbi&nbsp;Yishmael of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">)</span><span class="font5"> that everywhere in the Torah&nbsp;where the word: אם appears, what follows is something&nbsp;voluntary, as opposed to mandatory, with the exception of&nbsp;three times, our verse being one of these three. Our author&nbsp;warns us that if someone were to raise the question that the&nbsp;line in Exodus 21,30: אם כופר יושת עליו, “if ransom is laid upon&nbsp;him,” this is not something voluntary, this is not something&nbsp;mandatory, as the Torah in that paragraph does not describe&nbsp;events that are </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">bound</span><span class="font5"> to occur, and the verse only deals with&nbsp;the consequences of such events </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> they have occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The meaning of our verse is that if it is your desire to build an altar out of stones, (instead of only earth) you are&nbsp;free to do so provide that these stones have not been&nbsp;touched with metal tools when being shaped. [The Torah&nbsp;considers “stones” as included in the definition of “earth.”&nbsp;Ed.] You must use whole stones to build an altar. The reason&nbsp;follows, i.e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי חרבך</span><span class="font5">, “for your sword, etc.;” the word כי, here is used as an alternate proposition for the word אם. “if.” The altar is&nbsp;meant to promote peace and life, whereas the sword is used&nbsp;to shorten life. Something that had been shaped by the same&nbsp;material as that used to shorten life, could not serve as a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">symbol</span><span class="font5"> of peace and life, (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midot chapter 3 Mishnah&nbsp;4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ותחלליה, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">and you have profaned it.“ We have been told about the penalty for violating this commandment without&nbsp;having previously been informed of the prohibition. The&nbsp;Torah rectifies this by spelling out the prohibition not to use&nbsp;metal tools in hewing the stoned for such an altar in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 27,5: לא תניף עליהם ברזל, “do not wield an iron&nbsp;tool over them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,23. ולא תעלה במעלות על מזבחי</span><span class="font5">, “and do not ascend My altar by steps.” The word עליו restricts this prohibition to&nbsp;taking big steps to the altar, not including the manner in&nbsp;which you can walk in the Temple itself. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> בחדש,&nbsp;section 11)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Mishpatim</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,1. ואלה המשפטי</span><span class="font5">ם, “and these are the ordinances, etc.” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> whenever the word אלה appears, it&nbsp;signals a break with what preceded, whereas when the word&nbsp;ואלה appears it signals a continuation or addition of the&nbsp;subject that had been discussed previously. In other words,&nbsp;the correct translation of the word: אלה is: “these opposed to&nbsp;what preceded it,” whereas ואלה should be translated as&nbsp;“and these as well as the preceding verses.” The author&nbsp;warns the reader not to challenge </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> by quoting the word&nbsp;אלה in Leviticus 27,34, or the same word in Numbers 36,13,&nbsp;and Numbers 30,17 nor the same word in Deuteronomy&nbsp;28,69, as in those instances as well as in others like it, the&nbsp;previously mentioned subject is being concluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואלה המשפטי</span><span class="font5">ם, Rabbi Avahu, quoting Rabbi Yossi ben Zimra said that the word אלה represents a break with what&nbsp;was written previously, whereas when the word appears with&nbsp;the prefix letter ו it signals some type of continuation. He&nbsp;quotes Exodus 15,25, as an example, where the Torah had&nbsp;written: שם שם לו חוק ומשפט ושם נסהו, “there He made for them&nbsp;a fixed rule </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font5"> gave them social laws, there He put them to&nbsp;a test.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">המשפטי</span><span class="font5">ם, prior this paragraph the Torah spoke about aspects of being G’d fearing, whereas from now on it&nbsp;concentrates on rules that enable living in the land of Israel&nbsp;as a civilised nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: previously the Torah spelled out prohibitions as warnings, as for instance: “do not&nbsp;commit murder; do not commit adultery;” from here on in the&nbsp;Torah repeats the prohibitions but adds the type of penalty&nbsp;that applies to violating these prohibitions deliberately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the commentary by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here, who poses the question why we read here about the details of an altar,&nbsp;something entirely different from the subjects the Torah&nbsp;deals with here, he bases himself on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta,</span><span class="font5"> which&nbsp;suggests that this is a hint that the High Court should have&nbsp;its office near the Temple and that all these laws had been&nbsp;told to Moses while he was on the Mountain. The altar was&nbsp;after all also close to the Temple, immediately in front of its&nbsp;eastern entrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Logic dictates that the whole paragraph commencing with 21,2 “when you purchase a Jewish slave, etc., until&nbsp;chapter 23,10, ושש שנים תזרע, “and during six consecutive&nbsp;years you may plant seeds,” are all laws that G’d taught&nbsp;Moses while he was on the Mountain </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the people had&nbsp;heard the Ten Commandments. Concerning all these laws,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has written: these laws are a continuation of the&nbsp;earlier laws.” He is referring to the laws listed in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat&nbsp;B’har</span><span class="font5"> in the Book of Leviticus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לפניהם </span><span class="font5">“before them;” on this word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments: “before the Israelites and not before the gentiles,” even if you&nbsp;know that the gentile judges are experts in the section of law&nbsp;concerned in the litigation. When someone submits his legal&nbsp;problems to gentile judges he thereby desecrates the name&nbsp;of G’d, and simultaneously honours the reputation of the&nbsp;deity whom these judges worship. If the Jewish judges have&nbsp;given a ruling on the case and his Jewish opponent has not&nbsp;submitted to that judgment, the party deemed in the right&nbsp;may then appeal to gentile judges who have more power to&nbsp;enforce their ruling. [If both Jewish parties concerned are&nbsp;living in the Diaspora. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,2. כי תקנה עבד עברי</span><span class="font5">, “If you acquire a Jewish slave, etc.;” the reason why the Torah commences its list of social&nbsp;laws with this particular law is that the Israelites had recently&nbsp;been redeemed from slavery themselves, so that they had&nbsp;good reason to understand how important it is not to treat&nbsp;one of their own as they had been treated in Egypt. Even if&nbsp;an Israelite had committed a crime for which he had been&nbsp;sold, the maximum length of time he was allowed to have his&nbsp;freedom to choose his employer restricted was six years.&nbsp;Even during these six years, his master, who did not own&nbsp;him bodily even then, was not allowed to force him to&nbsp;perform menial tasks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי תקנה</span><span class="font5">, “when you purchased etc.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that the “slave” the Torah speaks about was not purchased at a&nbsp;public auction, but was acquired as a servant from a duly&nbsp;elected Jewish Court whose task it also is to ensure that a&nbsp;thief’s victim is compensated by his victim. If he cannot do so&nbsp;from his own means he is “sold,” i.e. his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">labour</span><span class="font5"> is sold for a&nbsp;maximum of six years, his victim being paid the wages that&nbsp;this servant would earn during the next six years if he had&nbsp;not been “sold,” and is given by the court to his victim. [This&nbsp;editor has rounded out the picture based on the Talmud, for&nbsp;the benefit of readers totally unfamiliar with this subject.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was some discussion in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> if our verse deals with an Israelite who had fallen on hard times and&nbsp;accumulated debts that he could not repay and who “sold&nbsp;himself,” (based on Leviticus 25,39). According to that view&nbsp;an Israelite “sold” by the court would not automatically be&nbsp;able to terminate his employment after 6 years maximum.&nbsp;This view is in apparent contrast with what the Torah wrote&nbsp;in Deuteronomy. According to Leviticus 25,46, gentile slaves&nbsp;who are owned bodily by Jews may be inherited by their&nbsp;children. The words ונמכר לך, “and he has been sold to you,”&nbsp;refer to an Israelite “sold” by the court. The Torah continues&nbsp;by decreeing that such a “slave” must not be required to&nbsp;perform menial tasks for his “master.” Clearly, this rule does&nbsp;not apply to gentile slaves whose bodies are owned by their&nbsp;Israelite masters. Deuteronomy 15,12 makes it quite clear&nbsp;that the law of releasing a slave after 6 years applies only to&nbsp;Jews who have been sold by the court. The passive form of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yimacher,</span><span class="font5"> is absolutely clear. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> does not&nbsp;disagree, but derives the rule from a different type of&nbsp;exegesis. The author there (Rabbi Yishmael) uses a method&nbsp;known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gezeyrah shaveh.</span><span class="font5"> [I have slightly abbreviated our&nbsp;author’s presentation of this subject. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שש שנים יעבוד</span><span class="font5">, “he is to serve for six years.” The number “6” in this verse is viewed also as an </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">allegorical</span><span class="font5"> reference to&nbsp;six empires that at one time or another will enslave the&nbsp;Jewish people. They are: “Egypt, Ashur, Babylon, the&nbsp;Medes, the Greeks, and the Romans, (descendants of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Edom</span><span class="font5">). According to this interpretation, after the collapse of&nbsp;the Roman Empire the Jewish people,- [as </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">a whole</span><span class="font5">, Ed.]- will&nbsp;not again experience enslavement. This is based on the end&nbsp;of the verse: “and in the seventh year he will be released&nbsp;unconditionally.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יעבוד</span><span class="font5">, “he will serve.” The word refers here to ordinary household chores etc., not to back-breaking labour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובשביעית</span><span class="font5">, “and in the seventh year;” at the beginning of his seventh year of service. The reference is to the&nbsp;beginning of the seventh year after this servant had been&nbsp;“sold.” When a Jewish servant has not been sold by the&nbsp;court, he is released only with the onset of the Jubilee year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יצא לחפשי</span><span class="font5">, “he will exit to freedom.” G’d, so to speaks is quoted as saying: “I have redeemed the Israelites from&nbsp;Egypt from the house of slavery (Exodus 20,2). My intention&nbsp;was that they will henceforth be free men. They are therefore&nbsp;not “free” to sell themselves into servitude.” This is the&nbsp;meaning of Leviticus 25,10: “for the Children of Israel are My&nbsp;servants.” My document proving that they are Mine has&nbsp;preceded anyone’s subsequent document, which is thereby&nbsp;rendered legally invalid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לחפשי</span><span class="font5">, some commentators claim that the letter ל at the beginning of this word, meaning “to” is superfluous, just as&nbsp;that letter is superfluous in Chronicles I 3,2: והשלישי לאבשלום,&nbsp;which means nothing other than והשלישי אבשלום, “the third:&nbsp;Absalom.” Here too the Torah had to write only: יצא חפשי</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">“will go free.” The letter י in the word חפשי, is a preposition&nbsp;just as in the word: הקדמוני in Ezekiel 10,19, which converts&nbsp;that word to mean: “which is at the eastern gate.” It is similar&nbsp;to the words: שלישי, רביעי, “third, fourth, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other commentators understand the prefix letter ל in לחפשי as converting its meaning to a noun: “לחופש, to&nbsp;freedom.” They compare it to expressions such as “to דרור.” If&nbsp;so, then the letter י at the end of the word: לחפשי would be&nbsp;superfluous, just as the letter י in the words: ,היושבי, המגביהי&nbsp;המשפילי in Psalms 23,1, 113,5 and 113,6 are superfluous.&nbsp;[seeing that there we deal with </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">poetic</span><span class="font5"> form of expressions, it&nbsp;is not fair to declare these words as superfluous. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other conditions terminating the period of Jewish slaves’ servitude are: sickness, though followed by his&nbsp;complete recovery. The word: חנם, “without compensation to&nbsp;the master,” is the Torah‘s way of informing us of this&nbsp;condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חנם</span><span class="font5">, without bureaucratic delays such as a document proving that the “slave” had been released by his master.&nbsp;Neither did he have to compensate the master for any hours&nbsp;of work not actually served during any part of those six&nbsp;years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,3. אם בגפו יבא, בגפו ילך</span><span class="font5">, according to the plain meaning of the text the meaning is: “he will leave in the&nbsp;same condition as when he had begun his term of service.”&nbsp;The Torah proceeds to illustrate this by quoting examples of&nbsp;how his personal status might have changed during these&nbsp;six years. Even though his master might have given him a&nbsp;gentile slave to live with and to have children with, the “wife”&nbsp;and children remain the property of his master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בגפו יצא</span><span class="font5">, “he will leave alone.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the line means that if this “slave” entered service while single, he&nbsp;will also leave while single. If he had been married before,&nbsp;his master can give him a gentile slave for the duration of his&nbsp;service. The reason is that if his master were to “give” him a&nbsp;gentile slave of his as a “wife,” and he would have children&nbsp;with her, he might grow so fond of her and her children, that&nbsp;at the end of the six years he would choose to remain with&nbsp;his master rather than to rejoin his Jewish wife. The chances&nbsp;of this happening to married man, is more remote. He&nbsp;presumably longs for his former family life, and he will leave&nbsp;as soon as is legally possible. His plea of preferring his&nbsp;gentile “family” under such circumstances is not acceptable&nbsp;by the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואם בעל אשה, </span><span class="font5">“but if he was married, -to a Jewish wife-“ at the time the court had ‘sold’ him,” his wife will leave with&nbsp;him; the wording means that he had consummated the&nbsp;marriage before being sold, not that he was only engaged, or&nbsp;that he was betrothed to the widow of a brother who had&nbsp;died without ever having had children. On this verse </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explains that the purchaser of a Jewish “slave,” is legally&nbsp;obligated to assume responsibility for said “slave’s” wife and&nbsp;children if any. Although nothing of that kind is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">written</span><span class="font5"> here,&nbsp;seeing that the Torah only writes that “he will leave with his&nbsp;wife,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> deduced it from a verse in Leviticus 25,41: ויצא&nbsp;מעמך הוא ובניו עמו, “he together with his children will leave.” In&nbsp;that verse no mention is made of his wife. We combine both&nbsp;verses in order to get the true meaning of the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,4. אם אדוניו יתן לו אשה, </span><span class="font5">“If his ‘master’ will give him a wife;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the “wife” is a gentile slave of his&nbsp;master, and this verse is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachic</span><span class="font5"> source that this is not&nbsp;only permitted, but that he may insist on his servant having a&nbsp;woman with whom he, and only he, performs marital union.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mechilta,</span><span class="font5"> chapter 2, on this verse) The logic -according to&nbsp;our author- appears to be that seeing that the master is at&nbsp;any rate obligated to provide for the wife and children of&nbsp;such a “slave,” [and the children having a gentile mother are&nbsp;not Jewish, Ed.] he may recover some of the expense he&nbsp;had by keeping the children of such a union. Targum&nbsp;Onkelos adds to his translation that the master is not&nbsp;permitted to “give” such a “slave” a Jewish wife, as no&nbsp;Jewish woman may be </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">forced</span><span class="font5"> to marry someone. If the&nbsp;“slave” had married a Jewish slave of his master during his&nbsp;stay there she will leave </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> him without the master&nbsp;receiving any compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points out here that proof that the master has no control over the body of a Jewish slave is that the Torah&nbsp;legislates that if such a Hebrew slave sold by her father&nbsp;reaches earlier than usual puberty, she immediately can&nbsp;leave her master. He quotes 21,7 as well as Deuteronomy&nbsp;15,12 as his proof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">האשה וילדיה</span><span class="font5">, “the woman and her children;” children are always mentioned after their mother; Compare Psalms&nbsp;116,16: אני עבדך בן עמתך, “I, Your servant, son of Your servant&nbsp;maid.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וא</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אמר יאמר העבד</span><span class="font5">, “and in the event that the&nbsp;‘slave’ will say insistently, etc.;” from this verse we learn that&nbsp;he must express this wish already during those six years,&nbsp;and repeat it at the end of his term of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">העבד</span><span class="font5">, the Torah means that such a person deserves to remain a “slave,” as his actions reflect the kind of actions&nbsp;that the Canaanites are known for. If someone prefers the&nbsp;status of servitude, abandoning his choices in life, he acts&nbsp;like Canaanite slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל הדלת או אל המזוזה</span><span class="font5">, “against the door or doorpost&nbsp;of the courthouse; we find an example of this in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 17,5: והוצאת את האיש ההוא אל שעריך, “you are to&nbsp;take out that man to your gates, (court);” This procedure is&nbsp;designed to give publicity to the irrational behaviour of this&nbsp;Jewish “slave;” let all the people passing the courthouse&nbsp;know who it is that has preferred life as a slave with a gentile&nbsp;slave to life as a free Israelite. He will have no chance to&nbsp;escape this status before the next Jubilee year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או אל המזוזה</span><span class="font5">, “or against the doorpost;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this that the Torah draws a parallel between “door” and&nbsp;“doorpost;” both are upright. What </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> means is that the&nbsp;doorpost is compared to the door </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> in respect of their both&nbsp;being upright. The definitive aspect of this procedure is&nbsp;found in Deuteronomy 15,17, where the Torah stipulates that&nbsp;the ear of the person who is going to have it pierced is to be&nbsp;adjacent to the door at that time. This is proved by the&nbsp;Jerusalem Targum which translates the word או in our verse&nbsp;as meaning אשר, “which is;” there are similar constructions to&nbsp;this, as in 21,36 או נודע כי שור נגח הוא, where the word או also&nbsp;means אשר, i.e. “an ox which is known to be aggressive.”&nbsp;The author quotes more examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In our verse here, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> prefers an allegorical explanation based on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. the ear which had&nbsp;heard G’d say at Mount Sinai: ”do not steal,” and which had&nbsp;heard G’d say: “the Children of Israel are My slaves,” needs&nbsp;to be reminded of this by being pierced after having opted to&nbsp;ignore both of these statements by G’d. Our author corrects&nbsp;the reference to “do not steal” from the Ten Commandments,&nbsp;as that commandment speaks of stealing persons, i.e.&nbsp;kidnapping. Therefore the version found in Leviticus 19,11 is&nbsp;preferred as there the Torah speaks of the theft of objects.&nbsp;Also, the prohibition in the Ten Commandments carries a&nbsp;death penalty as opposed to the version of theft discussed in&nbsp;Leviticus. In that version the ordinary penalty is to make&nbsp;restitution of twice the value of the stolen objects; if the thief&nbsp;is unable to come up with the money, then he [his labour,&nbsp;Ed.] is sold by the court to someone willing to buy him and to&nbsp;abide by the Torah’s rules concerning how to treat him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> chose the prohibition of stealing when he had so many others to choose from, is because the&nbsp;thief displayed greater fear of the Lord than many other&nbsp;kinds of sinners, as he committed his sin in secret when&nbsp;insulting G’d by being </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">more</span><span class="font5"> afraid of the police seeing him&nbsp;than of G’d seeing what he did. Moreover, the Jewish&nbsp;servant choosing to continue serving his master in spite of&nbsp;living with a non Jewish mate and raising non Jewish&nbsp;children, has demonstrated that he does not care what G’d&nbsp;had said nor what G’d’s servant, his master, has said. Hence&nbsp;his deliberately “faulty” hearing is being punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורצע אדוניו</span><span class="font5">, “and his master will proceed to pierce his ear;” the practical use of this procedure is that if he were to&nbsp;escape from his master during the years to come, the mark&nbsp;left on his ear will serve as evidence that he is an escaped&nbsp;slave. He will also not be confused with a Canaanite, as&nbsp;Jewish law forbids mutilating any part of a gentile’s body.&nbsp;Besides, when it comes to proving this when the escaped&nbsp;slave is positioned against the door where his ear had been&nbsp;pierced, the height of the hole in the door will match the hole&nbsp;in the slave’s ear when he is positioned there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אזנו</span><span class="font5">, “his ear;” the reason why this part of the body has been chosen by the Torah for this procedure is that if the&nbsp;slave were to protest that he had inflicted this hole upon&nbsp;himself, he would not be believed, as it is impossible for him&nbsp;to have done so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אזנו</span><span class="font5">, it was customary to mark someone who had not conducted himself as he should, by piercing his ear.&nbsp;From this custom evolved the practice to do this to thieves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במרצע</span><span class="font5">, “with an awl;” I have heard the following allegorical explanation of why this tool was chosen by the&nbsp;Torah for this procedure; (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> by&nbsp;Rabbi Menachem Kasher on the source item # 137) The&nbsp;cost of an awl used to be 400 coins of a certain&nbsp;denomination. G’d had decreed 400 years for Abraham’s&nbsp;descendants to be strangers and slaves, but </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">He</span><span class="font5"> had&nbsp;subsequently decreased the length of their serfdom. This&nbsp;slave who could have gotten his freedom, instead&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">volunteered</span><span class="font5"> to lengthen his period of serfdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועבדו</span><span class="font5">, ”and he is to serve him (his master)” only for his original master, not his son or daughter, if he dies&nbsp;prematurely. This verse is the source of the statement in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta </span><span class="font5">:“A Jewish “slave” serves his master (during the&nbsp;first six years) or his master’s son, but not his master’s&nbsp;daughter. If he had his ear pierced, or if it was a female&nbsp;Jewish “slave,” neither will serve after the master has died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעולם</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this word does not mean: “forever, i.e. the rest of his life,” but until the onset of the next&nbsp;Jubilee year. To the question that possibly the Torah did&nbsp;indeed mean that the “slave” in question would now have to&nbsp;remain a “slave” for the remainder of his life, the question is&nbsp;that in that event what was the point of the Torah having to&nbsp;write in Leviticus 25,46: והתנחלתם אותם, “you may leave them&nbsp;as an inheritance to your children,” (Canaanite slaves)? If&nbsp;even a Jewish “slave” could be inherited by your children,&nbsp;surely the Torah did not have to tell us that the same was&nbsp;true for bodily owned Canaanite slaves? Clearly therefore&nbsp;the Torah meant that such a Jewish slave would continue to&nbsp;the end of his natural life, usually no longer than seventy&nbsp;years in the status he had acquired as a result of having had&nbsp;his ear pierced. The Torah’s example here assumes that the&nbsp;thief had been about 20 years of age at the time he&nbsp;committed his crime, so that he had a life expectancy of&nbsp;another 50 years. It follows that the term</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעולם</span><span class="font5">, is another way of saying “for up to 50 years.” If the Torah had written: לעולם ועד, it would have meant: “until&nbsp;he dies.” This could have been supported by Samuel I 1,22,&nbsp;where the mother of Samuel tells her husband that she will&nbsp;hand over her son to the High Priest Eli, and she clearly&nbsp;meant by that “for the rest of his life.” In the event, Samuel&nbsp;died at 52 years of age, 50 years after having been handed&nbsp;over to Eli. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> on that verse, explains that she&nbsp;prophesied that Samuel would die at that age, without&nbsp;having been aware that her words had been a prophecy. He&nbsp;adds that 50 years are considered a euphemism for “a&nbsp;lifetime.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, as stated previously, Leviticus 25,10 in which a slave is included in the possessions that must be&nbsp;restored to their original status, the Jubilee year, the fiftieth&nbsp;in a cycle, is described as such a radical turning point in his&nbsp;life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,7. וכי ימכור איש את בתו</span><span class="font5">, “in the event that a father ‘sells’ his daughter, etc.;” the reason why the father here has&nbsp;been described as איש, “a man,” is to make clear that a&nbsp;mother is not allowed to “sell” her daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את בתו</span><span class="font5">, “his daughter,” but not his son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תצא כצאת בעבדים</span><span class="font5">, “she will not leave her “master’s” employ according to the same rules as does a male “slave.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains the word עבדים in this verse as referring to&nbsp;Canaanite slaves. If someone had thought that it referred to&nbsp;Jewish slaves, consider the fact that the Torah had&nbsp;separately legislated what the terms are when Jewish slave&nbsp;leaves his “master” in Deuteronomy 15,12. The conditions&nbsp;for releasing Jewish “slaves” had stipulated there that no&nbsp;difference is made between males and females. If you were&nbsp;to ask why the same rule does not apply regarding releasing&nbsp;a Jewish boy “servant” when he displays signs of puberty,&nbsp;seeing that we have a principle that the exegetical tool&nbsp;known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">heckesh,</span><span class="font5"> a comparison spelled out in the Torah,&nbsp;must not be applied in an arbitrary manner, the reason is&nbsp;that there cannot be a situation in which such a comparison&nbsp;could be legally valid, as there is no situation when the&nbsp;Torah provides for a male’s puberty resulting in such a&nbsp;change of his status. If he had sold </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">himself</span><span class="font5"> as a minor, the&nbsp;sale would not have been recognised as legally valid. We&nbsp;have already learned that his father was also not legally&nbsp;empowered to sell him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains further that the comparison that the Torah made between a female Jewish “slave” and a male&nbsp;one, applies to the fact that neither of them obtain their&nbsp;release by having lost one or more of their organs, including&nbsp;even the loss of a tooth. This law applies only to gentile&nbsp;slaves. If you were to argue that we did not need to have this&nbsp;spelled out for us as we could have arrived at this conclusion&nbsp;by using simple logic, i.e. if a female Jewish ”slave,” who is&nbsp;released after displaying signs of puberty, is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font5"> released&nbsp;when losing an organ, it is clear that a male Jewish slave&nbsp;who is not released from service when displaying signs of&nbsp;puberty, is most certainly not released either when he loses&nbsp;an organ. We must therefore conclude that this so-called&nbsp;logic is faulty, as an opposite conclusion could be arrived at&nbsp;by using the “same” logic in reverse. What is the&nbsp;disadvantage a female Jewish “slave” labours under? She&nbsp;does not get her release as a result of losing an organ.&nbsp;Seeing that she had not been sold as a result of having&nbsp;committed theft, her male counterpart would certainly not be&nbsp;released under similar circumstances as he had been sold&nbsp;as a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">penalty</span><span class="font5"> for having committed theft. In order not to arrive&nbsp;at the wrong conclusion by using “our” logic, the Torah&nbsp;therefore wrote: “the male Jew or the female Jew” in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 15,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תצא כצאת העבדים</span><span class="font5">, “the rules for her release are not the same as that for her male counterparts.” According to the&nbsp;plain meaning of this verse the Torah here is inserting a rule&nbsp;of civilised behaviour, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">derech eretz.</span><span class="font5"> Men are sent on errands&nbsp;all over the earth, by day and night, and encounter all kinds&nbsp;of temptation while doing so. If women had to doo this, this&nbsp;would be considered a great disgrace for them. The Torah&nbsp;therefore states that female Jewish servants are to be used&nbsp;by their masters only for tasks that do not require tem to&nbsp;leave their immediate environment, the master’s home. In&nbsp;Psalms 45,14 this is summed up under the heading of: כל&nbsp;כבודה בת מלך פנימה, “the entire glory of the King’s daughter is&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">within</span><span class="font5"> her,” (not on public display) Furthermore, the female&nbsp;Jewish “slaves” under discussion here are all minors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate approach: Whereas the male “slaves” leave the master’s employ unaccompanied by children they&nbsp;had sired while in his employ, (as discussed earlier) the&nbsp;female Jewish “slave,” if her master wants to have children&nbsp;by her, must first marry her, in which case she ceases to be&nbsp;a “slave” anyways. If the marriage does not work out, she&nbsp;will be divorced and take her children with her, like any&nbsp;normal woman who is divorced from her husband and gets a&nbsp;financial settlement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,8. אבל אם רעה, </span><span class="font5">“but if she is ugly, etc.” the term רעה while often used to describe moral ugliness, is also used to&nbsp;describe physical ugliness, i.e. being “sour-faced,” as we&nbsp;know from when Joseph asked the baker and cupbearer&nbsp;who had dreamt dreams which had upset them. Compare&nbsp;Genesis 40,7: ?מדוע פניכם </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">רעים</span><span class="font5"> היום, “why do you look so&nbsp;crestfallen today?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעיני אדוניה</span><span class="font5">, “in her master’s eyes;” so that he does not wish her to remain in his house as a prospective bride until&nbsp;she will have completed her years of service;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יעדה</span><span class="font5">, based on the word מועד, “appointed time;” it is used here as in Samuel II 20,5: מן המועד אשר יעדו, “from the&nbsp;appointed time that he (David) had set for him.” The spelling&nbsp;and reading of this word are יעדה and יעדו respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והפדה</span><span class="font5">, “in order to release her.” Seeing that neither her master nor his son are prepared to marry her, and he does&nbsp;not want her to release herself, but prefers for her to&nbsp;continue to work for him on a socially demeaning level, he&nbsp;has to release her and pay her some compensation. [We&nbsp;must remember that her master had paid her father in&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">advance</span><span class="font5"> for up to six years service. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והפדה</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash,i</span><span class="font5"> he must contribute to the cost of cancelling her contract, i.e. that she must repay for&nbsp;the years of the contract she had not fulfilled her part of. The&nbsp;master must forfeit part of what he could have claimed, as&nbsp;his contribution. You might well ask what the difference is&nbsp;between גרעון and סיוע? (verse 10) Since she has repaid the&nbsp;master for the years she has not worked, what loss did the&nbsp;master experience? Her value as a maid increased with&nbsp;every she grew closer to puberty. We might therefore have&nbsp;assumed that the value of her work is not based on the&nbsp;same amount each year. By not getting back more per year&nbsp;for the last three years this girl did not work, than for the&nbsp;each of the first three years when she was quite young, the&nbsp;master actually did experience a loss, גרע, by releasing her&nbsp;from her contract early.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעם נכרי</span><span class="font5">, “to an unrelated person;” (compare Ibn Ezra) to anyone other than her master he must not “sell her” to&nbsp;have dominion over her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא ימשול למכרה</span><span class="font5">, “he must not abuse his position of mastery even to marry her off (with her consent) to someone&nbsp;other than himself or to his son.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למכרה</span><span class="font5">, “to hand her over.” We find this term used in this sense also in Judges 4,9: כי ביד אשה ימכור ה' את סיסרא, “for the&nbsp;Lord will hand over Siserah into the hand of a woman.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בבגדה בה </span><span class="font5">“seeing he had betrayed her trust.” By not going through with his promise to marry her when she was&nbsp;old enough, he had betrayed her trust. The expression&nbsp;“betrayal” occurs often in relationships between husband&nbsp;and wife. It describes usually the break up, severance of&nbsp;married life with a partner. Our author quotes verses from&nbsp;Maleachi 2,14, and Jeremiah 3,20, where the prophet in&nbsp;each case refers to Israel having betrayed its relationship&nbsp;with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand the words: לעם נכרי as referring to a Canaanite, seeing that Canaanites are referred&nbsp;to as נכרי in Judges 19,12: אל עיר נכרי אשר לא מבני ישראל המה,&nbsp;“to a foreign city that does not belong to the Children of&nbsp;Israel.” Also in Kings I 8,41: ובא הנכרי אשר לא מעמך הוא, “or if a&nbsp;foreigner who is not a member of your people comes, etc;”&nbsp;there too the reference is to the Canaanite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators explain the words as follows: the subject of the word והפדה, is not the girl’s master but her&nbsp;father; he will have the right to cancel the contract and get&nbsp;his daughter released from its terms seeing that he has&nbsp;reneged on his promise to marry her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעם נכרי</span><span class="font5">, “to any other nation;” i.e. the father does not have the right to sell his daughter to anyone but a Jewish&nbsp;master. He might have been under the impression that since&nbsp;the Torah permitted him to sell his daughter while she is a&nbsp;minor, it does not matter to whom he sells her. After all,&nbsp;seeing that the Torah did not forbid him to sell himself to a&nbsp;gentile if his fellow Jews did not help him to stay financially&nbsp;afloat, so why could he not do the same with his daughter?&nbsp;Therefore the Torah had to expressly forbid him to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בבגדו בה, </span><span class="font5">“for having betrayed her,” as this was forbidden.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,9. כמשפט הבנות, </span><span class="font5">“according to the norms applying to daughters.” Normally, men betroth attractive girls to&nbsp;themselves and marry them, and celebrate the wedding with&nbsp;joy and decor, not like when one takes a lowly maid as a&nbsp;wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועונתה</span><span class="font5">, some commentators believe that the root&nbsp;of this word here is עון as in Isaiah 13,22: וענה איים באלמנותיו “&nbsp;and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate&nbsp;palaces.” The letter מ in the word מעון having been replaced&nbsp;similar to the way it has been in the words: מלון,מזון and מדון&nbsp;our verse then would prescribe that the departing female&nbsp;“slave,” be provided by her former master with food, clothing&nbsp;and an abode wherein to set up house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם שלש אלה, </span><span class="font5">“if he fails to provide any of these&nbsp;three items, she will leave his house without paying the&nbsp;master any compensation for leaving his employ before her&nbsp;contract had been completed.” (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצאה חנם</span><span class="font5">, “she will leave, with the consent of the court;” the Torah here does not specify a particular point in time, but&nbsp;does so at a later time in Deuteronomy 15,12, where we&nbsp;read: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי ימכר לך אחיך העברי או העבריה ועבדך שש שנים</span><span class="font5">, “when your&nbsp;brother the Hebrew is forced to sell himself to you or your&nbsp;sister a female Hebrew, he/she is to serve (work for) you for&nbsp;six years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אין כסף</span><span class="font5">, “if she falls sick at the end of her six years and is unable to leave, and her master supplies her with food,&nbsp;she need not compensate him for this. (Based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah&nbsp;shleymah</span><span class="font5"> by Rabbi Menachem Kasher </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishpatim,</span><span class="font5"> quoting&nbsp;Jerusalem Talmud, item 230 on our verse.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the simple meaning of the text, the words: אין כסף which are superfluous after the word חנם, “without&nbsp;compensation,” are a way of underlining the statement, just&nbsp;as the statement </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מת את ולא תחיה</span><span class="font5">, “you are dead and will not&nbsp;live.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מכה איש ומת</span><span class="font5">, “if someone strikes a man and he&nbsp;dies as a result;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains this as being based on&nbsp;Leviticus 24,17: ואיש כי יכה כל נפש אדם מות ימות, “if a man&nbsp;strikes a lethal blow on another human being it is a capital&nbsp;offence and the attacker will be subject to execution.” If you&nbsp;were to ask: “where did we ever hear that if a person strikes&nbsp;another and he does not die as a result, that he is still&nbsp;subject to execution? After all, even if he did cause his victim&nbsp;to lose a limb, he is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> liable for monetary compensation?&nbsp;Some commentators have provided what is a very forced&nbsp;answer by saying that if the injury to the victim of the blow is&nbsp;such that he will die within 12 months that the attacker will&nbsp;be subject to the death penalty. Alternately, the verse could&nbsp;have meant that death resulted from a blow with an&nbsp;instrument not meant to cause death. Since we could have&nbsp;thought that he would still be guilty of the death penalty as it&nbsp;is the result that counts, the Torah had to write that unless&nbsp;the weapon used was of a kind that is used as a lethal&nbsp;weapon the killer is not liable to the death penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why this paragraph follows closely after the paragraph dealing with how to treat a slave, is because most&nbsp;masters are in the habit of hitting slaves when they do not&nbsp;perform their duties diligently. The expression: מות יומת “he&nbsp;must certainly be executed,”-by decree of the court,-is meant&nbsp;to exclude the legislation applicable to a gentile slave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והאלוקים אנה לידו</span><span class="font5">, “and it was a result of divine&nbsp;will;” in other words, the person becomes guilty of death at&nbsp;the hands of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on this verse understands it as referring to an inadvertent killing, which was the result of inadequate&nbsp;precautions being taken by the person who caused it. He&nbsp;interprets it as a demonstration of the verse: מרשעים יצא רשע,&nbsp;“wicked people will cause wicked acts.” What is meant is that&nbsp;if someone has committed a serious sin unobserved and&nbsp;intentionally, so that he could not be brought to trial,&nbsp;providence sees to it that he will have to atone for this by&nbsp;committing unintentional death of an apparently innocent&nbsp;person. The example quoted is that the “sinner” was&nbsp;ascending a ladder, a rung of which broke and caused him&nbsp;to hit someone standing nearby in his fall. On our verse,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments: “this refers to unintentional killing.” He&nbsp;interprets the verse from Samuel I 24,13, by providing an&nbsp;illustration. The person sitting under the ladder had once&nbsp;killed intentionally, whereas the person falling from the&nbsp;ladder had once killed unintentionally when there were no&nbsp;witnesses who would have forced him to take refuge in the&nbsp;city set aside for such situation. Now, through divine&nbsp;intervention, both had received their penalties, each&nbsp;appropriate to his sin. Alternately, the scenario should be as&nbsp;follows: the party who had previously committed deliberate&nbsp;murder, fell onto someone holding a knife in his hand at the&nbsp;time. If we would not explain the verse in this manner, the&nbsp;person who had been guilty of execution by the sword would&nbsp;not have died by the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">proper</span><span class="font5"> type of execution, i.e. the sword.&nbsp;The example quoted also teaches that a person cannot&nbsp;become guilty having to go to the city of refuge twice. The&nbsp;reason is that once you have killed someone if in the&nbsp;process you have killed someone also unintentionally, you&nbsp;are penalised only for the more serious crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמתי לך מקום</span><span class="font5">, “I set aside for you a special place;” this commandment would not become effective until the people&nbsp;took up residence in their homeland. It is a hint of the cities&nbsp;of refuge to be legislated and introduced still during Moses’&nbsp;lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מעם מזבחי</span><span class="font5">, even when the murderer has taken&nbsp;refuge near My altar; all the more so when he escaped to&nbsp;one of these cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומכה אביו ואמו, </span><span class="font5">“and if someone strikes either his&nbsp;father or his mother;” why did this verse have to be written?&nbsp;[If killing someone not related to him by blood results in&nbsp;execution, is it not natural that he will not face a lesser&nbsp;penalty for killing his father or his mother? Seeing that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Torah had written: עין תחת עין, “an eye for an eye,” the Torah had to let us know that this law does not apply when the eye&nbsp;of one’s father had been gouged out by his son, but that he&nbsp;faces a more severe penalty in that instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Talmud employs an exegetical tool called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">heckesh,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. [according to some scholars, the 19<sup>th</sup> of these&nbsp;tools enumerated in the 32 such tools listed by Rabbi Eliezer&nbsp;son of Rabbi Yossi hag’lili. Ed.] In order to have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachic&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">validity, this instrument being used in a particular instance&nbsp;must have been a well known tradition, called in the&nbsp;language of our sages: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachah mi-Moshe mi Sinai,</span><span class="font5"> a ruling&nbsp;as binding as if it had been given to Moses at Mount Sinai.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In our case it would work as follows: just as someone if he has struck his neighbour’s animal is not culpable for such&nbsp;a deed unless the animal sustained a visible wound, so if&nbsp;one strikes one’s father or mother he becomes guilty of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">death</span><span class="font5"> penalty only if he had actually wounded his father or&nbsp;mother by such a physical blow. The reason it appears in our&nbsp;context in the Torah is that the penalty is parallel to that for&nbsp;murder, something discussed in our paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומכה אביו ואמו מות יומת</span><span class="font5">, “and someone striking his father or mother must be put to death.” The peculiarity here is that&nbsp;the Torah informed us of the penalty for violating the&nbsp;commandment before having spelled out the commandment&nbsp;not to strike anyone. Actually, the commandment that the&nbsp;penalty for striking someone and his being subject to 39&nbsp;lashes has been established, and the Torah had added that&nbsp;this number of lashes, (Deuteronomy 25,3) must not be&nbsp;exceeded by the person carrying it out as agent of the court.&nbsp;Actually, we could have derived that from logic also, i.e. “if&nbsp;the agent of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">court</span><span class="font5"> who carries out striking an individual is&nbsp;commanded not to exceed his authority, how much more so&nbsp;does such a rule apply to someone who had no authority to&nbsp;strike anyone!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mechilta, Mishpatim</span><span class="font5"> chapter 5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,16. וגונב איש, </span><span class="font5">“If one kidnaps another person, etc.”&nbsp;Why was this verse necessary? (it has been repeated in&nbsp;detail in Deuteronomy 24,7) If we had only had the verse in&nbsp;Deuteronomy, we would have thought that the penalty would&nbsp;apply </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> if we had witnesses to the kidnapping. We would&nbsp;not have known that witnesses to both the kidnapping and&nbsp;the subsequent selling of the victim were required in order&nbsp;for the death penalty to apply. Another thing these two laws&nbsp;have in common is that the death penalty is to be carried out&nbsp;by strangulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונמצא בידו, </span><span class="font5">“and he has been found in his possession;” another way of saying that the crime had been carried out in&nbsp;the presence of witnesses, or that there was so much&nbsp;circumstantial evidence as if it had been witnessed by living&nbsp;witnesses. [One cannot help thinking of coloured&nbsp;photographic evidence even showing the parties in motion.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מות יומת, </span><span class="font5">“the kidnapper is to be executed.” The reason is that having sold his victim it is almost certain that the&nbsp;victim will be so abused that he will die prematurely. As to&nbsp;the question where was the law written before the penalty&nbsp;was recorded in the Torah, the reader is directed to the eight&nbsp;of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20,13: לא תגנוב, “Do&nbsp;not steal!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,17. ומקלל אביו</span><span class="font5">, “and if someone curses his father;”&nbsp;from what is written here we only know that it is forbidden to&nbsp;curse one’s father while he is alive; how do we know that the&nbsp;same law applies to people cursing their fathers&nbsp;posthumously? The word: ומקלל formulated in the present&nbsp;tense, in the widest possible formulation includes cursing&nbsp;him anywhere anytime. Where is the commandment not to&nbsp;curse one’s father stated explicitly independent of the&nbsp;punishment in store for those who violate it? The reader is&nbsp;directed to Exodus 22,27: אלוהים לא תקלל ונשיא בעמך לא תאור,&nbsp;“Do not curse a judge and do not curse an elected political&nbsp;leader within your people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תקלל חרש</span><span class="font5">, “do not curse a deaf person!” The common denominator in these three prohibitions is that they&nbsp;are part of your people, and that your father and mother are&nbsp;similarly not only your relatives and have begotten you, but&nbsp;they are part of your nation, a holy nation. The reason why&nbsp;the Torah interrupts this sequence with verse 16, which&nbsp;deals with kidnapping, is that most people who are&nbsp;kidnapped are minors, who were unable to defend their&nbsp;abductor. As a result of having been kidnapped and sold to a&nbsp;foreign nation they will grow up in a country where they do&nbsp;not even know their parents, and when they get involved in&nbsp;an argument they will likely curse their fate and the father&nbsp;who had not protected them. Therefore this insertion is not a&nbsp;deviation from the theme the Torah deals with here. Verses&nbsp;16-17-18 have a common denominator, as the Torah hints&nbsp;that in practice the occurrence of these sins are inter-related&nbsp;through the negative experiences in life by the parties who&nbsp;become guilty of them. [We must never lose sight of the fact&nbsp;that the Torah does not address itself to wicked people, as&nbsp;this would be a waste of time. What wicked person would&nbsp;take any notice of it? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What the Torah did here was listing sins which originate in quarrels between people some of which result in&nbsp;violent action, others in violent language. The honour due to&nbsp;father and mother is based on the honour due to the Creator&nbsp;himself, seeing that father and mother represent two thirds of&nbsp;begetting each one of us, G’d being the remaining third, who&nbsp;had helped father and mother to produce progeny.&nbsp;Therefore, cursing parents or cursing G’d are part of the&nbsp;same phenomenon, the result of frustration of the guilty&nbsp;party. Moreover, in the case of G’d releasing one’s anger by&nbsp;striking out physically is obviously impossible. Therefore all&nbsp;three are treated in a similar manner when it comes to how&nbsp;such release of one’s anger is treated by the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators approach our whole paragraph as reflecting what our sages call: it ^ it </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;,</span><span class="font5"> “not only this but&nbsp;also this.” For example: not only a person who has been so&nbsp;angry that in striking his fellow he has actually killed him,&nbsp;deserves to lose his life as a result of such lack of restraint,&nbsp;but even people who killed </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> intention actually deserve&nbsp;the same fate seeing that they had been criminally negligent,&nbsp;but the Torah stops short of this by protecting their lives if&nbsp;they succeeded to reach a city of refuge before an angry&nbsp;relative had a chance to avenge his relative’s needless&nbsp;death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This approach is supported by the Torah stating that if such a killer had acted intentionally, and had sought&nbsp;immunity next to the altar, [a symbol for a location where&nbsp;violence is absolutely forbidden, Ed] by taking refuge in the&nbsp;precincts of the Temple, this will not protect him against&nbsp;being brought to court by force and tried. Having stated this,&nbsp;the Torah extends this to people who in their anger </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">struck a parent also deserve the death penalty. If their act&nbsp;leaves a mark, injury, on the body of either parent they will&nbsp;be treated as having committed a capital offense. Finally,&nbsp;even if the son or daughter did not raise their hands against&nbsp;either parent and cursed them instead, they are also dealt&nbsp;with as having hurt them bodily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכי יריבון אנשים, </span><span class="font5">“if two men engage in an&nbsp;argument that has become physical;” from this wording I&nbsp;might think that the legislation which follows applies only to&nbsp;males, how do we know that it applies equally to females?&nbsp;Rabbi Eliezer says that seeing that when the Torah&nbsp;discusses the subject of compensations for damages caused&nbsp;is written in general terms not mentioning men or women&nbsp;separately and mentions genders only a single time (in verse&nbsp;29, i.e. that the victim is either man or woman) it is clear that&nbsp;the entire subject applies equally to both sexes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או באגרוף, </span><span class="font5">“or with a certain type of stone,” (according to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum)</span><span class="font5"> The same expression is used by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat Kohanim&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">when explaining Leviticus 14,40 where the treatment of an&nbsp;eruptive like plague on the walls of a house is discussed.&nbsp;The usual translation of אגרוף, is: ”fist,” possibly not&nbsp;acceptable to the sages, as it is not a lethal tool, and the&nbsp;death of the victim </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">within</span><span class="font5"> 24 hours, which according to Torah&nbsp;law would be equivalent to murder, seems unduly harsh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם יקום והתהלך בחוץ</span><span class="font5">, “if he (the person who had&nbsp;been knocked to the ground) gets up and walks outside the&nbsp;house unaided;” if that person takes to his bed and does not&nbsp;even partially recover, so that he dies before having been&nbsp;able to walk, the party that knocked him down will be tried for&nbsp;murder (and executed if he had been duly warned by&nbsp;witnessing observing the fight).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על משענתו, </span><span class="font5">“supporting himself on his walking cane;” the word משענת is used in the Bible in this sense in Kings II 4,29:&nbsp;וקח משענתי בידך, ”and take my walking cane in your hand;”&nbsp;[Elisha speaking to his servant Geychazi)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבתו</span><span class="font5">, “compensation for income lost through being bedridden;” Compare use of this expression in Ruth 2,7: זה&nbsp;שבתה הבית מעט, “she has rested but a little.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ימן</span><span class="font5">, he (the one who inflicted the wound) has to “give,” even if the wounded person recovered without having&nbsp;sustained permanent damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכי יכה איש</span><span class="font5">, “and if a man strikes, etc.;” how do&nbsp;we know that the verse also addresses women? Rabbi&nbsp;Yishmael says what we already attributed to Rabbi Eliezer&nbsp;as an answer to this question on verse 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בשבט</span><span class="font5">, “with a rod;” the Torah chooses as an illustration instruments with which the average master disciplines his&nbsp;slaves. This is why the first letter ב in this word is “open,” as&nbsp;if the Torah had written: בהשבט. If the master had struck that&nbsp;slave with a sword or other instrument used to inflict death,&nbsp;he will be treated as an intentional murderer even if his&nbsp;victim survived for a day or two, seeing that this was not the&nbsp;way one disciplines a person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומת מחת ידו, </span><span class="font5">“and he dies as a result of this beating;” seeing that he had used permissible means of disciplining,&nbsp;the death of the victim is attributed to something like an&nbsp;accident, the master not having intended to deprive himself&nbsp;of the services of this slave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the expression: תחת ידו; “while still being beaten;” this is no longer “disciplining,” but&nbsp;killing with one’s own hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יום או יומים, </span><span class="font5">“a day or two days.” The reference is&nbsp;to one day that is equivalent to two days. The verse could&nbsp;not be referring to actual days, as if even one day’s survival&nbsp;is sufficient to absolve the killer from the charge of murder,&nbsp;survival for two days would not need to be mentioned.&nbsp;According to the plain meaning of the text, in consonance&nbsp;with the practice of the Torah, we can simply translate this&nbsp;as “he does not even have to survive two days for the&nbsp;master not to be accused of murder, even a survival of 24&nbsp;hours is sufficient.” We find a parallel construction in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 17,6: על פי שנים עדים או שלשה עדים, “on the basis&nbsp;of the testimony of two witnesses or three witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי כספו הוא</span><span class="font5">, “for he is as if his own money.” He has full control of the servant including beating him, but only in order&nbsp;to discipline him. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,22. </span><span class="font5">וכ</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">י ינצו אנשים</span><span class="font5">, “if men fight,” why was there a need for this verse? Seeing that from verse 14 where we&nbsp;were told only that deliberate killing of one’s enemy is&nbsp;punishable by death, we would not have known that when&nbsp;one kills one’s friend instead of one’s enemy in a fight, he&nbsp;would not be considered as a murderer, we are told now that&nbsp;when the objective of an altercation was to kill one’s&nbsp;adversary, it does not matter that one had killed the wrong&nbsp;target by mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are some commentators who do not understand this verse as prescribing the death penalty for the killer, but&nbsp;that he is only liable for monetary compensation to be&nbsp;assessed by the court. (Rabbi Yitzchok in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta&nbsp;Mishpatim</span><span class="font5"> chapter 8) He interprets our verse along the&nbsp;following lines: as long as we had only heard Leviticus&nbsp;24,17: if someone deliberately smites a human being (so&nbsp;that he dies) the killer must be executed, even if that human&nbsp;being had been born after a pregnancy of only eight months,&nbsp;(which according to the Talmud is not considered a baby&nbsp;with a regular life expectancy). The Torah here describes the&nbsp;premature birth of such a baby as a result of the mother&nbsp;having been struck as having given birth to a נפש אדם a&nbsp;human being in the full sense of the word. The wording in&nbsp;our verse makes it clear that only if the mother had been&nbsp;struck in the region of her body to which her fetus is&nbsp;sensitive, does the attacker deserve the penalty prescribed,&nbsp;not when she was hit on the head or other parts of her body&nbsp;not related to her pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: even if only one of her fetuses was killed. [The wording in the verse speaks about&nbsp;fetuses, plural. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשה הרה</span><span class="font5">, “a pregnant woman; we would have known this as soon as we read the balance of the verse in which we&nbsp;are told that she lost her fetuses when the Torah speaks&nbsp;about her losing her fetuses prematurely; how could she&nbsp;have done so unless she had been pregnant?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason that the Torah had to first inform us that she had been pregnant was to teach us that the attacker’s&nbsp;penalty is related to the fact that she had been pregnant and&nbsp;he should therefore have been especially careful, as well as&nbsp;to tell us that if the loss of her fetus could be attributed to the&nbsp;fact that she had been hit in the region of her womb, the&nbsp;penalty of which the Torah writes does not apply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ענוש יענש</span><span class="font5">, “he will be severely punished.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">explains here that the financial penalty is the value of the lost&nbsp;fetuses to the husband if these babies when healthy had&nbsp;been offered for sale in the slave market. If you were to ask&nbsp;why the attacker is not subject to the death penalty for&nbsp;murder, the answer is that there is no certainty that they&nbsp;would have been born after nine months as healthy babies.&nbsp;If this is a relevant consideration why is it not applied to fully&nbsp;grown human beings who might have been terminally ill had&nbsp;they lived to die naturally? The answer is that we base&nbsp;ourselves on the majority of such cases where the victim&nbsp;would prove not to have been terminally ill. To the question&nbsp;why we do not apply the same logic to the fetuses? If we&nbsp;were to do this the attacker would also have to be guilty for&nbsp;hitting the woman who is the mother of these fetuses. We&nbsp;have to derive from the wording of the various verses&nbsp;dealing with violent encounters between people that as long&nbsp;as the fetus has not seen the light of day, it has no market&nbsp;value, as decided in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Erchin</span><span class="font5"> folio 7,&nbsp;where it is stated that unborn fetuses have no claim to the&nbsp;estate of their fathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר ישית עליו בעל האשה</span><span class="font5">, In accordance with the conditions imposed upon him by the husband of the woman;&nbsp;in the event that the men who were fighting had decided to&nbsp;settle their dispute out of court. If they cannot agree on the&nbsp;amount of compensation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתן בפלילים</span><span class="font5">, he will have to abide by the court’s decision about damages. We find a similar construction in&nbsp;Leviticus 7,10: בלולה בשמן וחרבה, “mixed with oil, or dry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,26. לחפשי ישלחנו</span><span class="font5">, “he has to discharge him to freedom.” The Torah’s point here is that the slave does not&nbsp;have the option of accepting a financial settlement for the&nbsp;loss of his limb by his owner. The reason is that such a&nbsp;settlement would be useless to him, seeing that as long as&nbsp;he remains a slave all that he owns belongs to his master.&nbsp;Even a person who has sold himself into slavery with the&nbsp;express condition that his master cannot control his&nbsp;possessions, the master remains in a position that enables&nbsp;him by harassing his slave force him to hand over his&nbsp;belongings to him. The only way this can be avoided is by&nbsp;setting his slave free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,27. ישלחנו, </span><span class="font5">he will release him. The expression שילוח, is similar to the when we read in Deuteronomy 24,3:&nbsp;ושלחה מביתו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“he sends her away from his house;” the reason&nbsp;that the word: חנם, “without any compensation is absent here&nbsp;is the reason why the word: חנם “without compensation,” is&nbsp;absent here in our chapter, [as opposed to verse 11 in our&nbsp;chapter, where automatic release of slaves after 6 years&nbsp;service is discussed Ed.], is to teach us that the release&nbsp;must be accompanied by a document just as the document&nbsp;of divorce to a wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תחת שינו, </span><span class="font5">“on account of his tooth.” The Torah teaches us that even though the master owns the slave bodily, this&nbsp;does not mean that each body part of that slave is his to do&nbsp;with as he likes. G’d did not consent to slaves being owned&nbsp;in order for their masters to be able to mutilate them when&nbsp;they are angry at them. The Torah singling out the word: his&nbsp;“tooth” (sing), teaches that even if the slave lost only one&nbsp;tooth through his being beaten this suffices to his master&nbsp;having to free him unconditionally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the event that the master had caused the slave to lose an eye, and before releasing him he caused him to also&nbsp;lose a tooth, he will have to compensate him financially for&nbsp;the loss of the tooth, as by that time, halachically, he did not&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">own</span><span class="font5"> that slave’s body anymore, even though he was still&nbsp;under his physical control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to our author, the rule that a gentile slave receives his freedom in return for losing a limb, is arrived at&nbsp;by simple logic. If he gains his freedom at the hands of&nbsp;heaven when he becomes unable through disease to&nbsp;perform his duties, how much more does he qualify for his&nbsp;freedom when he has been abused by a human being&nbsp;owning him. [Rabbi Chavell in his glossaries, cites a&nbsp;statement from the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’rachot</span><span class="font5"> 5 according to which&nbsp;the logic is precisely the reverse, i.e. “if a gentile slave&nbsp;receives his freedom in return for having lost a limb as a&nbsp;result of punishment by his master, how much more so must&nbsp;G’d forgive sinners whose entire bodies have been punished&nbsp;by Him with painful sickness and disease!” This is what</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">David asked for when he said in Psalms 118,18: 'יסור יסרני קה ולמות לא נתנני, “the Lord punished me severely but did not&nbsp;hand me over to the angel of death.” Surely, if someone had&nbsp;to endure man’s inhumanity to man, he would be entitled to&nbsp;his release in exchange.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,28. וכי יגח שור את איש</span><span class="font5">, “when an ox gores a man, etc. up until this point the Torah had listed a number of situations&nbsp;when a human being had inflicted pain or loss of life; now it&nbsp;turns to damages caused by animals under the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">control</span><span class="font5"> of&nbsp;human beings, or property owned by human beings and not&nbsp;secured against causing damage to his peers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכי יגח שור את איש</span><span class="font5">, the expression: נגיחה is used when an ox gores a human being, whereas the expression: נגיפה is&nbsp;used when said ox gores another animal. The reason is that&nbsp;the fate of a human being is influenced by his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mazzal,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;astrological constellation of the stars when he has been&nbsp;born, and as a rule animals fear human beings (Genesis 9,2)&nbsp;so that even when they gore they take care not to inflict&nbsp;death. Animals do not enjoy this advantage and therefore&nbsp;being gored is generally fatal for them. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on&nbsp;Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Kamma</span><span class="font5"> folio 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">סקול יסקל השור</span><span class="font5">, “the offending ox is to be stoned to death. If you were to ask that if even an ox that did not have&nbsp;a history of goring people is subject to stoning, why did the&nbsp;Torah have to tell us that an ox </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> a history of goring has&nbsp;to be stoned? (verse 29) Answer: this is faulty logic; the&nbsp;reason why a hitherto tame ox is stoned is because no&nbsp;penalty of compensating the victim is imposed on the owner;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I could think that seeing that the owner of an aggressive ox that has killed a human being would not have to be stoned.&nbsp;To make sure that we do not think so, the Torah added that&nbsp;the guilty ox has to be stoned in all such situations. You&nbsp;might also ask that how can it happen that an ox will gore&nbsp;people twice or even three times, i.e. become labeled: “an&nbsp;aggressive ox” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מועד, </span><span class="font5">if he had been stoned to death already&nbsp;after the first time he killed a human being? Answer: either&nbsp;such an ox had escaped after it gored the first time, or, that&nbsp;whereas we know the ox but did not know who its owner was&nbsp;so that we could have accused him of deliberate negligence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יאכל את בשרו</span><span class="font5">, “and its flesh may not be eaten.” Is it not clear from the fact that this animal had to die through&nbsp;stoning that its flesh would be forbidden, seeing that only&nbsp;animals that have been killed by ritual slaughter may be&nbsp;eaten? The expression יאכל in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">passive</span><span class="font5"> mode, always&nbsp;means that it is not only forbidden to be eaten by Jews but&nbsp;may neither be fed to dogs or sold to gentiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובעל השור נקי, </span><span class="font5">and the owner of that ox remained free of guilt as long as his ox had not displayed signs of being&nbsp;aggressive. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וגם בעליו יומת, </span><span class="font5">“and also its owner is guilty of the&nbsp;death penalty by execution.” According to the plain meaning&nbsp;of the text he should be executed in practice, seeing that he&nbsp;was aware of allowing a dangerous animal to be on the&nbsp;loose, and he took no precautions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם כופר יושת עליו</span><span class="font5">, in the event that the heirs of&nbsp;the person who had been gored to death are willing to&nbsp;accept a financial settlement for their father having been&nbsp;killed;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ככל אשר יושת עליו</span><span class="font5">, “the owner must pay whatever is imposed upon him.” The reason that the Torah does not&nbsp;apply the principle that we do not accept financial&nbsp;compensation for killing human beings, is that that this rule&nbsp;applies only if the human being in question has </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">personally&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">committed such an act. [The reason that this verse begins&nbsp;with the word: “if”, is that most people would spurn such an&nbsp;offer by the party who was responsible for their father’s&nbsp;death.” The word אם, “if” here, does not belong to the list that&nbsp;the author had made when this word is not an option.&nbsp;(Compare Exodus 20,22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם בן יגח או בת</span><span class="font5">, “if it gores a son or a daughter;” it&nbsp;is most unusual for the Torah to spell out separately that the&nbsp;victims are either man or woman, or son or daughter;&nbsp;(Compare verse 28). Why did it do so here? The reason is&nbsp;that the owner of the ox could have argued that if the father&nbsp;of the child who had been killed had taken care of hjs son or&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">daughter</span><span class="font5"> these would not have been where the animal could&nbsp;have attacked them with impunity. The Torah had to inform&nbsp;us that such an excuse by the owner of the ox which had&nbsp;killed is absolutely irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation: when the Torah speaks of free people, the status of minors and adults is exactly the same.&nbsp;(Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba kamma</span><span class="font5"> folio 43) when the victim of this ox&nbsp;was either a child of a slave who was still a minor, the owner&nbsp;of the ox is not liable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם עבד יגח השור</span><span class="font5">, “if the ox had gored a slave,&nbsp;either a male of a female slave, (which had already been&nbsp;legally labeled as an aggressive ox) this latter point is clear&nbsp;without having to be spelled out, otherwise killing a slave&nbsp;would be rated as a more serious offense than killing a free&nbsp;man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כסף שלשים שקלים, </span><span class="font5">the compensation payable by the ox’s owner to the owner of the slave is to be 30 shekels. This&nbsp;corresponds to the value of a free woman between the ages&nbsp;of 20-60 years of age as stated in Leviticus 27,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והשור יסקל</span><span class="font5">, “and the offending ox is to be stoned to death.” This is the only way we can be sure that it will not at&nbsp;some time in the future also gore a free man. Seeing that it&nbsp;is customary for the slaves to be looking after the master’s&nbsp;livestock, feed them, etc., it is not a rarity that sometimes an&nbsp;animal turns on its keeper. This will lead to arguments&nbsp;between the owner of ox and the family of the slave as to&nbsp;how much the dead slave was worth. In order to forestall&nbsp;such arguments, the Torah spelled out a fixed amount for all&nbsp;such situations. Seeing that the chances that a free man&nbsp;becomes the victim of such an ox are statistically quite&nbsp;insignificant, the Torah uses a different yardstick in&nbsp;evaluating the damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכי יפתח איש בור</span><span class="font5">, If a man opens the lid over a pit&nbsp;(which had been placed there to protect pedestrians); the&nbsp;Torah refers to a pit which had remain fully covered for a&nbsp;long time, or even if that person had a dug pit which had&nbsp;never been in that place, and he had not bothered to cover it&nbsp;because he intended to dig deeper on the following day;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יכסנו</span><span class="font5">, “and he fails to cover it.” If he had covered it, he is free from further responsibility, provided that he&nbsp;covered it securely. The term “securely” is applied to a cover&nbsp;strong enough to prevent a wagon loaded with stones from&nbsp;collapsing the cover. (Jerusalem Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Kamma 5,7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One is not permitted to dig a hole underneath the public streets unless wagons loaded with stones can cross&nbsp;above it without concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונפל שמה שור</span><span class="font5">, “and an ox falls into it.” Human beings, seeing that they have been given a brain by G’d, are&nbsp;expected to look where they are going, and if they come to&nbsp;harm due to not looking out for themselves, the person&nbsp;causing the obstacle is not held responsible. [How different&nbsp;from our time when people try to sue the city for potholes on&nbsp;the sidewalk! Ed.] The Torah adds here the word: או חמור, “or&nbsp;a donkey,” to tell us that if people‘s belongings fall into that&nbsp;hole, the person who dug it is also not responsible as these&nbsp;belongings must have been carried by a human being who&nbsp;did not look where he was going. (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Kamma,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 53)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: Oxen and donkeys are mentioned here as they are the most likely animals to fall&nbsp;into such a hole. What applies to them applies to all other&nbsp;animals also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בעל הבור</span><span class="font5">, “the one responsible for that hole;” this&nbsp;cannot refer literally to the owner of the land on which the&nbsp;hole has been dug, but must refer to the one who created&nbsp;the hazard on it. The owner of the land, if not the same, is&nbsp;completely free from responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והמת יהיה לו</span><span class="font5">, “and the carcass will belong to the person who caused the damage,” as seeing he has paid full&nbsp;damages this is only fair. (This is the plain meaning of the&nbsp;verse, not necessarily the Talmud’s, there being a debate&nbsp;about who is the subject of the word: לו, “his”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומכרו את השור החי</span><span class="font5">, “and they sell the surviving&nbsp;ox.” What the Torah writes here applies only when the&nbsp;damage was caused through the ox being used on land that&nbsp;was not owned (or leased) by the owner of the ox. If it had&nbsp;been on property owned or leased by the ox’s owner, the&nbsp;party causing the damage is free from responsibility as the&nbsp;party that caused the damage can say to the owner: “what&nbsp;business did your ox have on my property?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">וחצו את כספו וגם את המת, “they will share equally the price they realized for the surviving ox as well as that they&nbsp;salvaged for the carcass of the animal that was killed.”&nbsp;Seeing that the animal that gored did not have a history of&nbsp;being aggressive, its owner had no reason to take special&nbsp;precautions by tying it up. Fate played an equal role for both&nbsp;in causing them to suffer a financial loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,36.</span><span class="font5">, “and he had not secured it;” actually we could have learned this by simple logic. If an owner of an ox that&nbsp;had gored must bear half the cost of the loss of its victim if&nbsp;the offending animal had had a reputation for&nbsp;aggressiveness and its master had not secured it, he surely&nbsp;must be liable for the whole damage! Why do we need the&nbsp;words: “and he had not secured it?” Therefore we learn that&nbsp;this word speaks another type of guarding that ox; he has to&nbsp;also muzzle such an ox so that it cannot become guilty of&nbsp;causing damage with its mouth, by either biting, or grazing in&nbsp;other people’s fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation why the words: ולא ישמרנו are needed; logic does not suffice to impose penalties. Perhaps&nbsp;someone could come up with another aspect nullifying our&nbsp;logic. Therefore penalties have to be spelled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation: the penalty applies even if the offending ox had been looked after on behalf of its owner&nbsp;by someone who did not charge the owner a fee for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,37. כי יגנוב איש</span><span class="font5">, “if a man steals etc,” the legislation applying to the stolen goods having either been slaughtered&nbsp;and consumed or disposed of commercially, and the thief&nbsp;has been found, i.e. אם ימצא הגנב, applies also to the&nbsp;slaughterer and the seller (if they are not the thief himself).&nbsp;They are all penalised with 4 or five times the value of the&nbsp;objects they were trying to dispose of before they could be&nbsp;found. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטבחו או מכרו</span><span class="font5">, and the thief had either slaughtered it or sold it; here we could also say that logic would have told us&nbsp;this. If the slaughterer is guilty of this penalty, surely the one&nbsp;who had sold it is also guilty of it? Had the Torah not written&nbsp;this example we would have reasoned that this is proof that&nbsp;penalties can be imposed by the court by the judges simply&nbsp;using their logic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטבחו או מכרו</span><span class="font5">, why did the Torah choose these two examples of how a thief wishes to eliminate suspicion from&nbsp;himself? Just as slaughtering and subsequently eating the&nbsp;ox is an irreversible act, so selling him and transferring&nbsp;ownership is a similarly irreversible act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חמשה בקר וגו' וארבע צאן</span><span class="font5">, “five times the value of cattle, etc. or four times its value if he stole a sheep or goat.” The&nbsp;reason why the thief faces a relatively smaller penalty if the&nbsp;object he stole was a sheep or goat, is that he had to&nbsp;demean himself by carrying the animal from where he stole&nbsp;it. He did not use such tactics when stealing a large animal&nbsp;such as an ox. Also the loss of an ox to its owner is more&nbsp;serious as it deprives him of an animal that works for him&nbsp;while in his possession. This is not the case with sheep or&nbsp;goats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation for the penalties imposed for hiding evidence. Stealing a large animal such as an ox is&nbsp;evidence that the thief had experience in how to steal&nbsp;successfully. Stealing a lamb successfully is no evidence&nbsp;that the thief had become a professional thief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תחת השור.... תחת השה</span><span class="font5">, “in exchange for the ox, in exchange for the lamb. The reason that the Torah repeats&nbsp;this legislation for each animal separately, is that by doing so&nbsp;it teaches that this particular legislation applies </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> in the&nbsp;event that either of these categories had been stolen and&nbsp;sold, etc. It does not apply if the stolen animal had been a&nbsp;camel or donkey, for instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,1. אם במחתרת ימצא הגנב</span><span class="font5">, “if the thief was discovered while tunneling” (acting so as not to be discovered);&nbsp;according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> he had left behind </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">evidence</span><span class="font5"> of forcible&nbsp;entry into the victim’s house;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אין לו דמים</span><span class="font5">, “the owner is not guilty of having shed the blood of that thief.” The thief had made it plain that he was&nbsp;afraid of a potentially fatal confrontation with the owner of&nbsp;that house who would physically protect his belongings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,2.</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אם זרחה השמש עליו, “</span><span class="font5">if the thief had remained in full view of his potential victim;” (and the owner had killed&nbsp;him)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דמים </span><span class="font5">לו, “he is guilty of bloodshed;” the intended victim of the thief, the owner of the house. If it had been clear to&nbsp;that owner that the intruder did not mean to kill but only to&nbsp;steal, and he overreacted by killing him, then he must make&nbsp;restitution. Unless he felt immediately threatened by the&nbsp;intruder and had reason to be so, killing him is a form of&nbsp;manslaughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He (the thief) has to pay fourfold or five fold its value as the case may be seeing he has disposed of it. If the thief&nbsp;cannot repay the value of the stolen items plus the penalty&nbsp;imposed upon him, he will be sold in order that the owner&nbsp;can be compensated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חיים שנים ישלם, </span><span class="font5">if the animal in question is still alive and well, he will pay twice its value. (including the live animal)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,4. כי יבער איש שדה או חרם</span><span class="font5">, “when a man lets his livestock loose to graze in someone else’s field or vineyard;”&nbsp;the expression בער always describes destruction of&nbsp;something, as in Deuteronomy 21,9: ואתה תבער דם הנקי, “you&nbsp;must out eliminate innocently spilled blood;” [we are more&nbsp;familiar with the expression from getting rid of our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chametz&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">on the eve of Passover. The author quotes two more&nbsp;examples, which I omitted. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מיטב שדהו</span><span class="font5">, “from the best quality of his own field;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">explains that this verse teaches that whenever damages are&nbsp;paid in kind instead of in cash, the quality of the&nbsp;compensation is to be of the best that the offending party&nbsp;possesses. The reason for this is that most people always&nbsp;treasure what is personally their own to its equivalent in&nbsp;twice that in someone else’s possession. [The origin of that&nbsp;proverb is Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Metziah</span><span class="font5"> folio 38. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, what is his own he is familiar with and therefore prefers it to something he is not familiar with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, in order to make a sure that people do not cause damage with their livestock in other people’s&nbsp;property this penalty is meant primarily to ensure that they&nbsp;make sure their animals do not stray to other people‘s&nbsp;property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When it comes to compensating a creditor for a borrower defaulting on a loan, another type of damage, the&nbsp;Torah allows the borrower to pay in kind by giving him the&nbsp;lowest quality of his land. The reason that the Torah applies&nbsp;a different yardstick there is to insure that owners of&nbsp;livestock have to pay such heavy fines so that no one will be&nbsp;scared to take out a loan as the chances of having to pay 4&nbsp;or 5 times the amount owed is too daunting. The sages&nbsp;agreed therefore that the amount of land in lieu of cash&nbsp;repayment would taken from the medium quality of land&nbsp;owned by the person defaulting. In the case of a divorcee or&nbsp;a widow being paid out her </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ketuvah,</span><span class="font5"> financial settlement the&nbsp;husband or heirs may use the lowest grade land they own.&nbsp;After all, the woman in question had not sustained any loss&nbsp;as a result of which this payment had become due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מיטב שדהו, </span><span class="font5">“from the best grade of soil that he owns;” here we speak of the land owned by the party that had&nbsp;caused the loss, i.e. the party who has to pay damages must&nbsp;do so during the harvest season when the value of the field&nbsp;is at its highest value. [This is the plain meaning of the text,&nbsp;whereas </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> above had not explained according to the&nbsp;plain meaning but had switched subjects in the verse. Ed.]&nbsp;The injured party, after all had lost the harvest from the area&nbsp;that the offender’ ox had grazed instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,6. כסף או כלים לשמור</span><span class="font5">, “money or chattels for safekeeping.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> here states that in this verse the Torah&nbsp;speaks of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shomer chinom,</span><span class="font5"> of a friend or relative who&nbsp;undertook this task without charging a fee. The logic is that&nbsp;when you undertake to look after such things as money or&nbsp;inert chattels, no additional labour or expense is involved by&nbsp;the party under whose care this service is performed. He&nbsp;simply stores these items in the same place where he stores&nbsp;his own valuables. This is why, if they were stolen or lost, the&nbsp;keeper is not held responsible as he had given them the&nbsp;same attention as he had given to his own valuables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וגנב מבית האיש, </span><span class="font5">“and it has been stolen from the house of the man;” the reason for this verse is to tell us that what&nbsp;follows applies only if these goods had been stolen from the&nbsp;original keeper, not if in the meantime they had been stolen&nbsp;again from the thief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ישלם שנים</span><span class="font5">, “the second party will not only have to make restitution but will have to pay double as if he had stolen it in&nbsp;the first place. The reason is that this so called “safekeeper,” had explained the object’s disappearance by&nbsp;claiming that it had been stolen from him. His penalty is the&nbsp;same as if he personally had stolen it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ישלם שנים לרעהו</span><span class="font5">. He is to pay twice its value to his fellowman, i.e. the one who had entrusted the object to him.&nbsp;This appears to contradict another verse in Leviticus 5,24&nbsp;where we have been told that when someone had sworn a&nbsp;false oath concerning illegally misappropriated property, that&nbsp;he had to pay a penalty of only one fifth of the value of said&nbsp;property. How do we reconcile these two verses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When someone had admitted his fault </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> first having denied it on oath, he repays the value of said object and&nbsp;adds one fifth [of the value plus a penalty of 25%, actually,&nbsp;so that of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">combined</span><span class="font5"> value the portion that is penalty&nbsp;represents one fifth. Ed.] whereas if he had denied it and&nbsp;was found guilty through witnesses testifying against him, he&nbsp;has to pay twice the value of the stolen object as penalty&nbsp;including the original value of the misappropriated object.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Mechilta Mishpatim,</span><span class="font5"> 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,7. ונקרב בעל הבית</span><span class="font5">, “the owner has to come to court for the purpose of confirming his claim by an oath;” This rule is&nbsp;applicable if he had claimed not to have misappropriated&nbsp;said object or objects which had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">disappeared</span><span class="font5">. If he had&nbsp;claimed that the object or animal had become the victim of&nbsp;wild beasts, etc. he is only asked to produce evidence&nbsp;supporting his claim before a court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במלאכת רעהו, </span><span class="font5">a somewhat strange sounding expression; it means: “something belonging to his fellowman;” we find a&nbsp;similar construction in Genesis 33,14: לרגל המלאכה, Yaakov&nbsp;referring to his livestock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,9. חמור או שור או שה</span><span class="font5">, “a donkey, an ox or a lamb;” this paragraph speaks of guarding a neighbour’s belongings&nbsp;in return for payment. This obligates the guardian to accept&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">additional</span><span class="font5"> responsibility for keeping it safe. The animals&nbsp;mentioned need to be fed by its keeper, so that it is normal&nbsp;for him to charge a fee for this. If the purpose of his&nbsp;accepting this assignment is to protect these animals against&nbsp;marauding wild beasts such as wolves, he is expected to&nbsp;prevent this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומת</span><span class="font5">, “and it died {from natural causes;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או נשבר</span><span class="font5">, or it was seriously injured by marauding beasts;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או נשבה</span><span class="font5">, “or it was kidnapped by force;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">all these examples are listed as categories of force majeure, an act of G’d, against which the keeper of these&nbsp;animals had been powerless. If the keeper is willing to swear&nbsp;before a court that he had not been negligent and thereby&nbsp;contributed to the loss, he is considered as having&nbsp;exonerated himself. If he had not been paid for his “safekeeping,” all he had to do was to claim it had been stolen,&nbsp;and he would not have had to render an oath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אין רואה</span><span class="font5">, “there had not been a witness,” (to substantiate the keeper’s claim). These words apply only to&nbsp;the claim of the animals having been kidnapped by armed&nbsp;robbers. The reason these words were not used in verse 6 is&nbsp;that the expression “stealing,” is only used when the act had&nbsp;not been witnessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.10. שבועת ה' תהיה בין שניהם</span><span class="font5">, “the oath of the Lord shall be between the two of them;” that death occurred&nbsp;accidentally and not through negligence by the keeper. If the&nbsp;death had occurred in a place where there are people, the&nbsp;keeper would have to pay as his oath is not accepted in such&nbsp;circumstances. Had he told the truth, witnesses would have&nbsp;come forward to support his claim of innocence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בין שניהם</span><span class="font5">, “in order to release the keeper from responsibility.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אם לא שלח ידו</span><span class="font5">, “if he (the keeper) had not done something inappropriate, but that death had occurred by&nbsp;accident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.11.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גונב יגנב מעמו ישלם</span><span class="font5">, “but if that animal had&nbsp;(only) been stolen from him (the keeper)” [and no violence or&nbsp;threat of violence had been involved] he has to compensate&nbsp;the owner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.12. אם טרוף יטרף יביאהו עד</span><span class="font5">, “if it had sustained fatal injuries, he must produce the torn animal as proof (in order&nbsp;to be exonerated) The “proof” referred to are the remains of&nbsp;the animal or animals in question. The condition of these&nbsp;remains will speak for themselves. This is what the&nbsp;shepherds do when having to account for animals missing&nbsp;from the flocks under their care. We have proof of this from&nbsp;Amos 3,12, 'כאשר יציל הארי מפי הדוב שתי כרעים או בדל אוזן וגו,&nbsp;“as the shepherd saves from the mouth of the bear, or a leg&nbsp;or part of the ear, etc.” If this was not what is meant, why&nbsp;would the prophet mention such small parts of an animal?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'וכי ישאל איש וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and if someone borrows, and it&nbsp;is injured or dies, ”while its owner is not present;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">שלם ישלם, the borrower has to pay the lender for the value of that animal. The reason for this all encompassing&nbsp;responsibility of the borrower is that he had the complete use&nbsp;of the animal while it was under his care. The lender could&nbsp;claim that the death or harm occurred while the borrower&nbsp;had overworked that animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם בעליו </span><span class="font5">, “if its owner” was present at the time&nbsp;his animal died (and was aware that it had not been&nbsp;overworked) the borrower is free from paying any&nbsp;compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אם שכיר הוא</span><span class="font5">, “if said borrower had paid for the use of the animal while under his care,” the plain meaning of the text is&nbsp;that the subject of the word: שכיר, is that the party who had&nbsp;lent the animal was himself not the owner but had rented it.&nbsp;Our sages, however, understand the meaning to be that the&nbsp;borrower had paid a fee to the owner for using the animal.&nbsp;The Torah decrees that the liability for death or disabling&nbsp;harm is that of the owner must bear the burden of the loss as&nbsp;he had received compensation for letting the borrower use it.&nbsp;He had used his animal for his own purposes by lending it&nbsp;out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,15</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יפתה איש</span><span class="font5">, “if a man seduces, etc.” having concluded dealing with the subject of stealing animals or&nbsp;chattel, the Torah turns next to the subject of “stealing&nbsp;someone’s heart;” such a thief is called: .מפתה</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר לא אורשה</span><span class="font5">, “who had not been betrothed.” If the girl had been betrothed the penalty would be death by stoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מהור ימהרנו לו</span><span class="font5">, “he must make her his wife by paying the accepted price for brides. The reason for this is in order to&nbsp;restore her dignity in the eyes of her peers, so that she will&nbsp;not be married by another man at bargain basement prices&nbsp;reducing her status permanently, and being permanently&nbsp;reminded of her inferiority. Since she had not reached the&nbsp;age of 12 and a half, she had been too young to realise the&nbsp;consequences of being seduced. After having gone through&nbsp;the formalities, her husband can divorce her, seeing he had&nbsp;not raped her but she had consented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם מאן ימאן אביה לתתה לו</span><span class="font5">, if her father steadfastly&nbsp;refuses to let her be married to her seducer, her seducer&nbsp;must nonetheless pay the price paid for virgins who become&nbsp;married for the first time. That price is 50 shekel, and this is&nbsp;the reason why the word: ישקל “he must weigh it,” is used&nbsp;here. [We are familiar with this expression from when&nbsp;Avraham weighed the silver pieces to Efron in Genesis&nbsp;23,16 in order to acquire Sarah’s burial plot, the cave and&nbsp;field of Machpelah. Ed.] This is also the amount of&nbsp;compensation paid for having raped a virgin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ketuvot</span><span class="font5"> 38)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מכשפה לא תחיה</span><span class="font5">, “You </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">must not allow </span><span class="font5">a</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">sorceress to remain alive.” The reason why this apparently unrelated subject follows on the heels of how to deal with&nbsp;seducers is that people who seek ways and means to gratify&nbsp;their illegal sexual urges, turn to sorceresses to help them do&nbsp;so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תחיה</span><span class="font5">, an unusual way of describing the death penalty, has to be understood as translated by Onkelos, i.e.&nbsp;instead of only violating a positive commandment when&nbsp;allowing a sorceress not to be executed, any court failing to&nbsp;execute her is also guilty of transgressing a negative&nbsp;commandment, a much greater sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If someone reads this word as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tichyeh,</span><span class="font5"> with the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chink,</span><span class="font5"> [when the line would mean “</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">she </span><span class="font5">shall not live,”] he&nbsp;errs. We must be active in preventing her from living, i.e. the&nbsp;court must execute her. The death penalty of stoning is&nbsp;applied. The Torah compliments anyone who takes the first&nbsp;step in bringing about the legal execution of a sorceress.&nbsp;The longer she is allowed to remain alive, the longer she can&nbsp;practice her nefarious trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל שוכב עם בהמה מות יומת</span><span class="font5">, “anyone indulging in&nbsp;carnal relations with an animal must be executed legally.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After dealing with a minor girl who had been too young to understand what she had been guilty of, the Torah turns&nbsp;to animals which have no mouth with which to protest being&nbsp;raped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מות יומת</span><span class="font5">, that person will be executed by stoning. In Leviticus 20,16 the Torah elaborates further by decreeing&nbsp;that both parties involved in such an activity will be killed.&nbsp;The Torah there spells out that both the human being and&nbsp;the animal are perceived as having forfeited their lives, i.e.&nbsp;דמיהם בם, in the event that the animal initiated this sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זובח לאלוהים</span><span class="font5">; according to the plain meaning of&nbsp;the text, the Torah does not speak of an Israelite, as the&nbsp;Israelites had all been warned repeatedly against offering&nbsp;sacrifices to deities. Exodus 20,3, had made this abundantly&nbsp;clear. The Torah refers here to a convert to Judaism who is&nbsp;mentioned subsequently in verse 20 in a different context.&nbsp;Concerning such a person the legislation against having&nbsp;carnal relations with animals applies also. It was necessary&nbsp;to spell this out as it was a common practice among&nbsp;Arameans. (Syrians)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בלתי ה' לבדו</span><span class="font5">, offerings may only be offered to the Lord, (His attribute of the four-lettered ineffable name). This&nbsp;teaches that if one were to serve both </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> and another&nbsp;deity as did the people who converted having been&nbsp;transplanted after the destruction of the kingdom of the Ten&nbsp;Tribes by the Assyrians (Sancheriv), [conversion inspired by&nbsp;fear of the Jewish G’d, did so without abandoning their&nbsp;former deities. They are referred to in the Talmud as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kutim,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">geyre arayot,</span><span class="font5"> converts afraid of lions which ravaged the&nbsp;region to which they had been transplanted. Ed.] (Compare&nbsp;Kings II 17,33) The Torah decrees that anyone following&nbsp;such a practice is to be treated as a fully fledged idolater,&nbsp;and punished accordingly. This is why the Torah stresses&nbsp;the word: לבדו, “Him exclusively.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וגר לו תונה</span><span class="font5">, “and you must not oppress a&nbsp;convert;” the reason why this verse follows that about&nbsp;converts serving both </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> and their previous deities, is&nbsp;that G’d wishes to go on record that although He finds&nbsp;serving another deity as something repulsive, He does love&nbsp;converts and appreciates that they distanced themselves&nbsp;from their former religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תלחצנו</span><span class="font5">, “do not abuse him.” We must not abuse the converts by using them to perform menial labour. Seeing&nbsp;that by definition they are unfamiliar with the ways of the&nbsp;Israelites, our culture, etc., it would be too easy to take&nbsp;advantage of their ignorance by assigning to them degrading&nbsp;work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.21. כל אלמנה ויתום לא תענון</span><span class="font5">, “Do not oppress any widow or orphan.” The word כל in this verse has to be&nbsp;understood as in Exodus 20,10: לא תעשה כל מלאכה, not as&nbsp;meaning: ”do not do ail the work,” but as: “do not do any&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Compare also Exodus 20,4: תמונה, “do not make for yourself any likeness;” it does not mean that you are only&nbsp;forbidden to make for yourselves likenesses of aj] that is on&nbsp;heaven or earth.” The Torah mentions the proselyte as he&nbsp;has no family in Israel and therefore no one who can advise&nbsp;him or protect him. He belongs to the weakest members of&nbsp;society. Next the Torah mentions widows and orphans, who&nbsp;though natural born Israelites either have lost their protectors&nbsp;or had never had any.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תענון</span><span class="font5">, the reason why the Torah used the plural mode when exhorting us not to exploit this group of people,&nbsp;something most unusual, is because so many people are in&nbsp;the habit of doing just that when they face weak people. The&nbsp;Torah includes therefore all the people who witness such&nbsp;exploitation and do not protest it, are included in this&nbsp;prohibition. This is why also the penalty for people guilty of&nbsp;this has been written in the plural mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחרה אפי והרגתי אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “My anger will flare up and I will kill you;” (verse 23)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם ענה תענה אותו</span><span class="font5">, “if you nonetheless oppress&nbsp;him, etc;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points out that at this point the penalty for&nbsp;such behaviour has not been spelled out, but it is spelled out&nbsp;when the victim complains to G’d about the treatment that he&nbsp;had to endure. The verse has two sections, the second one&nbsp;commencing with: “your wives will become widows, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אם צעוק יצעק</span><span class="font5">, “but if you do mistreat them;” this is a reference to the orphan, as he, being a minor does not even&nbsp;have a concept of what such discrimination means and he&nbsp;does not know how to show people what he feels, as&nbsp;opposed to the widow who had not always been mistreated&nbsp;while her husband had been alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שמוע אשמע צעקתו</span><span class="font5">, “I will most certainly respond to his outcry;” for people guilty of oppressing him should have&nbsp;been punished by the court; the Torah proceeds to describe&nbsp;that G’d will apply penalties which reflect the sin of the sinner&nbsp;so that he will know why he has been punished. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם כסף</span><span class="font5">, the reason why the law to extend loans&nbsp;to the needy has been written here is that the three&nbsp;categories of people mentioned previously, i.e. the proselyte,&nbsp;the orphan and the widow are the ones most in need of&nbsp;borrowing money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תהיה לו כנושה</span><span class="font5">, “do not treat him (the borrower who is tardy in repaying same) like a creditor;” some commentators&nbsp;understand the expression נשה as “forgetting,” as when&nbsp;Joseph said in Genesis 41,51: כי נשני אלוקים, “for G’d has&nbsp;enabled me to forget, etc.;” the meaning of our verse then&nbsp;would be that you are not allowed to act towards the debtor&nbsp;like someone who constantly reminds him not to forget to&nbsp;pay back the loan. He does so by reminding the borrower for&nbsp;how long he had deprived his creditor by making him wait for&nbsp;getting his money back. He is also reminded by the Torah&nbsp;not to impose interest payments for the overdue period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא משימון עליו נשך, </span><span class="font5">“you must not impose interest payment on him (the borrower). The reason that here the&nbsp;Torah again uses the plural mode, is that loans always&nbsp;involve several people, the lender, the borrower, and the&nbsp;witnesses to the transaction. All of these are guilty of the&nbsp;transgression to charge or pay interest for loans from&nbsp;Israelites to other Israelites if they are </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">silent</span><span class="font5"> parties to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם חבול תחבול</span><span class="font5">, “if you have taken as a pledge,”&nbsp;(security for overdue loan) the pawn had been collected by&nbsp;the court’s messenger with the court’s permission. This is&nbsp;clear from Deuteronomy 24,11, where the Torah commands&nbsp;the creditor to remain outside the borrower’s house when&nbsp;collecting or returning it. This is an example of what has&nbsp;been discussed in verse 24: “do not treat him like a creditor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תשיבנו לו, </span><span class="font5">“you have to restore it to him;” you may argue that if this is the procedure to be followed then the borrower&nbsp;can drag out repayment until the day he dies? We therefore&nbsp;have to understand this verse as follows: the agent of the&nbsp;court did not secure this pledge until after the loan had&nbsp;already become overdue, and he had handed it to the&nbsp;lender. The rule of restoring such a pledge for immediate&nbsp;use by the borrower is valid only for thirty days. This is the&nbsp;period that the court intervenes in the matter. When the thirty&nbsp;days have elapsed and the loan has not been repaid, the&nbsp;lender is entitled to sell this pledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The words</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">: תשיבנו לו</span><span class="font5">, “restore it to him,” the subject is the pledge, seeing that the word חבול is masculine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,26. כי היא כסותה לבדה </span><span class="font5">“for it is her only blanket to cover herself with (at night).” The same is the case if she has&nbsp;only one garment to wear during the daytime. If she&nbsp;possesses more than one of each of those items, the lender&nbsp;need not return the pledge every evening and morning for&nbsp;exchanging one against the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה כי יצעק אלי, </span><span class="font5">“it will be that if the borrower will cry out to Me in prayer,” (accusing you of inhuman conduct) if the&nbsp;borrower had died from frost during the night because you&nbsp;had not given him or her back her only blanket then I will pay&nbsp;the lender back for such harshness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of the line </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי חנון אני: </span><span class="font5">even though it cannot be expected that the lender, who had&nbsp;demonstrated empathy by lending the poor borrower his&nbsp;money in the first place, should now be expected to restore&nbsp;the security deposit to the borrower who had not repaid him,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I will pay heed to his prayer because </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">am compassionate; you, on the other hand, instead of emulating My attributes,&nbsp;have acted brutally. The Torah had not used this statement&nbsp;of G’d reminding the reader of His being compassionate in&nbsp;connection with the treatment of orphans and widows, as&nbsp;their mistreatment had been forbidden by law, not merely by&nbsp;an appeal to the people’s good nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אלוקים לא תקלל</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">Do not curse G’d or a judge;”&nbsp;the reason why this verse has been inserted here is because&nbsp;maybe the lender transgressed the law to restore a pledge&nbsp;under the circumstances defined in the Torah, and in his&nbsp;frustration, the borrower curses the judge who had permitted&nbsp;him to take that pledge as security for the loan, even though&nbsp;the judge had acted according to the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונשיא בעמך לא תאור</span><span class="font5">, “neither shall you put a curse on legitimately installed authorities in your land.” Usually only&nbsp;wealthy people rise to the position of chieftain, and usually&nbsp;such people are prepared to extend loans to the needy. It&nbsp;stands to reason that the legislation about pledges is&nbsp;directed at them therefore. The borrower is warned not to&nbsp;forget that he has been a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">beneficiary</span><span class="font5"> of that rich man’s&nbsp;possessions when he obtained the loan. It would be the&nbsp;reverse of gratitude if he were now to curse that chieftain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מלאתך</span><span class="font5">, “your fullness;” a difficult word to&nbsp;translate; our sages understand it as “the first tithe, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">for the priest, to be lifted from your harvest.” The word also&nbsp;occurs in Deuteronomy 22,9: פן תקדש </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">המלאה</span><span class="font5"> הזרע אשר תזרע,&nbsp;“lest the seed you have sown will not be allowed for your&nbsp;use.” (grain harvest)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ודמעך, “</span><span class="font5">and the corresponding </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah</span><span class="font5"> of the harvest of your liquid crop (grapes and olives) will be denied you for&nbsp;use.” The word דמע</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">literally meaning: “tear,” is applicable to&nbsp;olives and grapes as they release their insides in drops, like&nbsp;tears, when being squeezed in the vat. We also find the&nbsp;expression תירוש used for grain products in Numbers 18,12,&nbsp;כל חלב יצהר וכל חלב תירוש ודגן, “all the best of the new oil, wine&nbsp;and grain’” where the Torah instead of speaking of grapes&nbsp;and olives, lumps them all together under one heading, the&nbsp;heading being: something liquid. [Whisky and other alcoholic&nbsp;rinks are made from grain. Ed.] When the offering of firstling&nbsp;fruits is discussed, seeing that these fruit are offered “as is,”&nbsp;in their original state, any expression hinting at liquids would&nbsp;be inappropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תאחר</span><span class="font5">, “Do not put off;” to give Me </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">My </span><span class="font5">share. The Torah speaks of giving G’d the respective firstling offerings&nbsp;which are due Him seeing that He treats the Jewish people&nbsp;as His firstborn son. They are: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראשית אדמתך</span><span class="font5">, the first ripened&nbsp;parts of produce grown from the earth (23,19), the first&nbsp;produce of your kneading bowls, (bread or cake, Numbers&nbsp;15,20).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of this phrase: “do not be late in offering Me what is legally Mine, even if you are still poor;”&nbsp;this is why the commandment of “giving” G’d the first born&nbsp;son and the firstborn males of his ritually pure livestock,&nbsp;followed immediately, as they represent the first results of&nbsp;his virility. (compare Deuteronomy Numbers 21,17).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בכור בניך תתן לי</span><span class="font5">, “you are to give Me the firstborns of your sons.” The emphasis is here on the word: “your&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">firstborn</span><span class="font5">,” as opposed to one of the sons born later. The&nbsp;same principle that applies to the first of your harvests&nbsp;applies to the first products (male) of your virility. The Torah&nbsp;repeats that the same applies to the firstborn of your&nbsp;domestic animals, i.e. cattle and sheep. At the same time,&nbsp;you must not be in such a rush that you slaughter these&nbsp;animals during the first seven days of their lives, as during&nbsp;those days they have not yet shed the ritual impurity status&nbsp;that applies to any creature that has undergone the&nbsp;traumatic experience of having to leave its mother’s womb.&nbsp;Prematurely born animals do not qualify for the purposes of&nbsp;this legislation as they are treated as if blemished. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor&nbsp;shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,30. ובשר בשדה טרפה</span><span class="font5">, “flesh from animals that were found in the field torn,” you must not eat; eating such flesh is&nbsp;an even greater sin than eating the flesh of animals that died&nbsp;of natural causes but had not undergone ritual slaughter.&nbsp;The probable reason is that such torn carcasses may have&nbsp;become infected by harmful bacteria transmitted by the&nbsp;marauding beast that had caused their death. It is therefore&nbsp;to be left untouched on the field where found. Animals that&nbsp;died a natural death may be sold by you to human beings,&nbsp;as opposed to the dogs to which you may feed the remains&nbsp;of animals which had died a violent death. By selling the&nbsp;carcass of an animal which died from natural causes to&nbsp;human beings blessed with a brain, you do not expose such&nbsp;a human being to potential poisoning. The reason why the&nbsp;Torah inserted this verse here is because it had previously&nbsp;been speaking of animals which are fit for you to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכלב תשליכון אותו</span><span class="font5">, “you may throw the remains of such torn animals to the dogs.” The first letter ל in the word לכלב&nbsp;has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach,</span><span class="font5"> indicating that the Torah does not&nbsp;speak of just “any dog.” It speaks of dogs which guard your&nbsp;flocks and which therefore have earned this privilege. This is&nbsp;the plain meaning of the verse. The word: אותו, refers to the&nbsp;flesh of said animal, seeing that it is in the masculine&nbsp;singular mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תשא שמע שוא</span><span class="font5">, “do not spread false rumours;”&nbsp;the expression תשא from the root נשא, ”to carry,” is used here&nbsp;as “carrying by mouth;” another example of the same&nbsp;expression being used in a similar context is found in Psalms&nbsp;16,4: ובל </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אשא</span><span class="font5"> את שמותם על שפתי, “so that their names will not&nbsp;pass my lips.” In other words: “let me not utter a lie.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל תשת ידך עם רשע</span><span class="font5">, “do not join hands with a wicked person.” It follows automatically that you must not join him in&nbsp;giving false testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא תענה על ריב</span><span class="font5">, “and do not ignore the majority&nbsp;view seeing you consider yourself as smarter than your&nbsp;colleagues, when this would result in perverting justice;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחרי רבים להטות</span><span class="font5">, “but make certain that the verdict is based on a majority of the judges’ opinions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ודל לא תהדר</span><span class="font5">, “and do not favour the poor (because&nbsp;he is poor). This verse follows closely on the heels of not&nbsp;testifying falsely, in order that you do not think that it is your&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">duty</span><span class="font5"> to assist a poor man in his dispute with a rich man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;השב </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">תשיבנו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> לו</span><span class="font5">, “make sure to restore it to him;” the&nbsp;Torah repeats this instruction to remind you that it may&nbsp;require that you perform this act for your enemy’s ox even&nbsp;repeatedly. (Compare Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> folio 32.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וחדלת מעזוב לו</span><span class="font5">, “and you feel like refraining from&nbsp;raising it;” you are warned not to remain inactive when faced&nbsp;with the animal’s distress, even if its owner is your enemy.&nbsp;This is also the way the Onkelos understands the word לו,&nbsp;seeing that he describes the Torah’s reflecting the first&nbsp;reaction of the finder here being that he is not called upon to&nbsp;do for his enemy’s property what he himself has failed to do,&nbsp;but that he at least has to assist him. This interpretation is&nbsp;also hinted at in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary on Deuteronomy 13,9,&nbsp;where he emphasizes that one’s enemy is exempt from the&nbsp;commandment: “to love your fellow man as yourself.” He&nbsp;quotes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifrey</span><span class="font5"> as his source for his interpretation of the&nbsp;words; .לא תאבה לו</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תעזוב </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">עמו</span><span class="font5">, these words have been interpreted in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> folio 32 as meaning that the Torah&nbsp;does not instruct the owner of that donkey to sit down while&nbsp;you alone attend to his donkey’s problem, but that you are&nbsp;called upon only not to abandon the animal but to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">assist</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;owner in relieving his donkey’s discomfort. If his owner has&nbsp;abandoned his beast, the enemy of his owner need not do&nbsp;the work by himself. [Torah legislation addresses human&nbsp;beings, not angels. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עמו</span><span class="font5">, “with him;” it is impossible for one person alone to unload the burden carried by this animal while it is in a state&nbsp;of collapse. Two men have to work, one on each side of the&nbsp;animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תטה משפט אביונך בריבו; </span><span class="font5">“do not subvert the rights&nbsp;of your destitute people in their disputes.” The Torah means&nbsp;not to rule in his favour when in fact he is in the wrong. This&nbsp;warning of the Torah is addressed to the judge or judges of&nbsp;the court dealing with his dispute, even though the Torah did&nbsp;not spell this out specifically. We find another example of&nbsp;such implied meanings in Deuteronomy 15,20, where the&nbsp;Torah writes: לפני ה' אלוקיך תאכלנו “you are to eat it in the&nbsp;presence of the Lord your G’d,” (i.e. on the sacred precincts&nbsp;of the Temple compound) an instruction that can only be&nbsp;fulfilled by a firstborn who is also a priest at the same time,&nbsp;seeing that non priests are forbidden in that compound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah has warned earlier in verse 3 of our chapter that the judges must not rule in favour of the poor out of&nbsp;sympathy for them. Here it warns that the judges must also&nbsp;not rule against the poor (for fear of angering the rich).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונקי וצדיק</span><span class="font5">, “and the ones free from sin, and the&nbsp;“just,” i.e. the ones who have been acquitted by the court;”&nbsp;according to the translation it is hard to see the difference&nbsp;between the נקי and the צדיק in this commandment. Our&nbsp;author understands the word נקי as applying to someone&nbsp;who had been free from sin, as opposed to the צדיק,&nbsp;someone who had committed the sin but could not be&nbsp;convicted through lack of witnesses acceptable by the&nbsp;Torah, or who had not been legally warned before&nbsp;committing the sin he had been accused of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושחד לא תקח</span><span class="font5">, “and you must not accept a bribe;”&nbsp;the reason why this has been repeated here is that even if&nbsp;the judge would accept a bribe in order to rule justly, he must&nbsp;not accept such a bribe. His decisions must not be&nbsp;influenced by a bribe. Although judges in Jewish&nbsp;jurisprudence did not receive salaries in order to make them&nbsp;independent, they were allowed to accept payment for the&nbsp;wages lost while sitting in court, each according to his&nbsp;respective vocation. [Three judges might receive three vastly&nbsp;different amounts of compensation according to the salary&nbsp;scale payable of people of his profession. Ed.] The reason&nbsp;why this subject came up here again is that the wealthy&nbsp;litigants are likely to bribe the judges to rule in their favour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויסלף דברי צדיקים</span><span class="font5">, “for bribes even blind the righteous judges.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וגר לא תלחץ</span><span class="font5">, “and do not oppress the stranger.”&nbsp;Here too the Torah speaks about the treatment strangers&nbsp;may have to endure at court. In the earlier reference to the&nbsp;stranger, (22,2), the Torah referred to how we are not to&nbsp;treat the stranger in every day life, not when he is involved in&nbsp;litigation. It is repeated here as he is also one of the sections&nbsp;of society that is likely to be taken advantage of as they have&nbsp;no one to stand up on their behalf. It is easy to get away with&nbsp;taking advantage of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ו</span><span class="font5">שש שנים, “and for six consecutive years, etc.”&nbsp;the reason why this legislation is repeated here is because&nbsp;the Torah allocates the produce of the seventh year to the&nbsp;poor, the underprivileged (verse 11).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונטשתה</span><span class="font5">, “you are to let it lie fallow;” in practice&nbsp;this means that you are not to collect the grain that has&nbsp;grown during that season in your field for your own use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואכלו אביוני עמך, </span><span class="font5">“whereas the destitute people of your nation shall consume it.” In another verse the Torah writes in&nbsp;Leviticus 25,6: לך, ולעבדך ולאמתך ולשכירך ולתושבך, “for </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">you,</span><span class="font5"> your&nbsp;male servant, your female servant, your hired hands and&nbsp;your residents.” How do we reconcile this? Answer: when&nbsp;there is an abundance of grain, etc., everyone is entitled to&nbsp;eat from it (so that it does not go to waste); when there is a&nbsp;scarcity only you and your household (servants male and&nbsp;female) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> on this verse.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: as long as the time for finally disposing of that crop has not arrived, both the poor&nbsp;and the rich may avail themselves of it. Once that time has&nbsp;expired, only the poor are allowed to avail themselves of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ששת ימים תעשה מעשיך</span><span class="font5">, “during six days you may&nbsp;pursue your usual pursuits, etc.;” why is this verse inserted&nbsp;at this juncture? It is because of the commandment to allow&nbsp;also the son of your maidservant and the stranger to rest on&nbsp;the Sabbath, seeing that generally they are poor people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובכל אשר אמרתי אליכם</span><span class="font5">, “concerning all that I have&nbsp;told you.” All the regulations pertaining to the Sabbath days&nbsp;in normal years also apply in the seventh year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: “I am not warning you only concerning that your servants and domestic beasts have to&nbsp;observe a rest on the Sabbath, but these are only examples;&nbsp;all the other rules concerning work prohibitions on the&nbsp;Sabbath apply, regardless of the fact that you do not work&nbsp;the field a whole week during the seventh year. Your&nbsp;vessels, stoves, vats, etc., have to observe rest on the&nbsp;Sabbath.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third explanation: All the details that I have commanded you ever since the revelation at Mount Sinai&nbsp;concerning the observance of the Sabbath remain in force&nbsp;indefinitely without interruption. The verse is a repetition of&nbsp;warnings the Torah had issued on previous occasions. We&nbsp;have other examples of this type in Deuteronomy 27,26:&nbsp;ארור אשר לא יקים את דברי התורה הזאת לעשות אותם, “cursed be he&nbsp;who fails to observe the words of this Torah;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet another explanation of our verse: this is a warning concerning the meticulous observance of all the positive&nbsp;commandments. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this was necessary as&nbsp;the vast majority of the Sabbath regulations concern what is&nbsp;forbidden, and do not require us to actually perform an&nbsp;activity, only to desist from performing it. The verse also is a&nbsp;hint at the rule that when a positive and a negative&nbsp;commandment appear to be in conflict, the performance of&nbsp;the positive commandment takes precedence. (Talmud&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> folio 3.) The logic behind this is that by performing&nbsp;the positive commandment one automatically fulfils the&nbsp;negative commandment attached to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the verse applies only to negative commandments as the grammar in the verse, i.e.&nbsp;the word: תשמורו, warns against violating something by a&nbsp;contrary activity. This is what the Rabbis had in mind when&nbsp;they said in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eyruvin</span><span class="font5"> 96: “wherever the expression השמר פן, or&nbsp;אל appears, it is always a warning not to do something that&nbsp;the Torah had forbidden. These expressions only occur&nbsp;when a negative commandment had already been the&nbsp;subject of discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושם אלוהים אחרים לא תזכירו</span><span class="font5">, “and you must not (even) mention the name of other deities.” The reason why this&nbsp;warning appears next to the previous laws is to remind us&nbsp;that G’d had already warned us about this also. In other&nbsp;words, “you are to remember all the other commandments&nbsp;except this one which is in essence something that must not&nbsp;be remembered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,14. שלש רגלים</span><span class="font5">, “three times (a year);” you need not&nbsp;exert yourself by coming to Jerusalem and the Temple more&nbsp;than three times a year, i.e. to have to “lose” valuable time&nbsp;from your agricultural activities by having to travel long&nbsp;distances, etc; other religions are far more demanding of&nbsp;their worshippers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תחוג לי, </span><span class="font5">“you will celebrate for Me.” You will mention My name in connection with your joyful celebration. On&nbsp;Passover you will celebrate the anniversary of your&nbsp;redemption from Egypt; on Pentecost you will celebrate the&nbsp;giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai; and on the festival of&nbsp;huts you will celebrate in thanks for a bountiful harvest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחג הקציר</span><span class="font5">, “and the festival of the harvest. (Wheat harvest around Shavuot)” The Torah spelled this festival out&nbsp;as especially intended as one of being joyful, (compare also</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isaiah 9,2: כאשר יגילו בחלקם שלל, “as they exult when dividing spoil.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחג האסיף, </span><span class="font5">and the festival of ingathering.” (all the fruit of the orchards and vineyards) Seeing that you fulfill these&nbsp;commandments in consonance with My commandments&nbsp;they are dedicated to My Name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שבעת ימים תאכל מצות</span><span class="font5">, “you will eat unleavened&nbsp;brad for seven days.” This line refers back to the words: חודש&nbsp;האביב, “the month of spring;” the reason for this is to remind&nbsp;you that regardless of the fact that the festival commences&nbsp;on the fifteenth day of the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5"> you must make&nbsp;sure that this date occurs </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> the spring equinox, i.e. that in&nbsp;certain years you will have to add an extra month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Adar</span><span class="font5"> to&nbsp;ensure that this will occur. If you were not to do that the&nbsp;firstling offering of the new barley harvest on the 16<sup>th</sup> of that&nbsp;month would not be acceptable as such. You would then&nbsp;have to appear before the Lord ריקם, “empty-handed,”&nbsp;without fulfilling the specific commandment connected to that&nbsp;date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יראו פני ריקם, </span><span class="font5">“they shall not appear before Me empty-handed;” the “they,” are the males who have been&nbsp;commanded to make these three annual pilgrimages. They&nbsp;and their sons are viewed by Me as “My children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר תזרע, </span><span class="font5">“which you will sow;” you are&nbsp;perceived by the Torah as sowing in G’d’s field; this is why&nbsp;He commanded you to donate the first ripe produce to Him,&nbsp;as a sort of tax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בצאת השנה</span><span class="font5">, “at the conclusion of the year, which is the beginning of the following year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שלש פעמים בשנה</span><span class="font5">, “three times during the year;”&nbsp;the reason this is repeated as it is part of the commandment&nbsp;for the males to make three pilgrimages to the Temple&nbsp;annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא ילין חלב חגי</span><span class="font5">; “and the fat of My festival offering&nbsp;must not be allowed to be left lying until the morning.” This is&nbsp;applicable only to the Passover offering, the fat of which was&nbsp;destined for the altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד בקר</span><span class="font5">, “until morning;” it has the same rule as the meat of the Paschal lamb, concerning the edible parts of which,&nbsp;the Torah had already written in Exodus 12,10 that none&nbsp;must be left over until morning, and if for some reason some&nbsp;was left over it must be burned forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חגי</span><span class="font5">, “My festival;” another word for “My offering,” the offering tendered to Me. This expression is not unique; we&nbsp;find it also in Psalms 118,27: אסרו חג בעבותים, “bind the&nbsp;festival offerings to the horns of the altar;” In chapter 12 the&nbsp;Torah had decreed this as applicable to the original Paschal&nbsp;lamb in Egypt. (Not allowing any to remain by morning) Here&nbsp;the Torah repeats the instruction as applicable to the annual&nbsp;Passover offering serving as a reminder of the original one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,19. ראשית בכורי אדמתך</span><span class="font5">, “the first choice fruits of your soil, etc.;” why did this verse have to be written? Seeing that&nbsp;in Deuteronomy 26,2, the Torah had written: ולקחת מראשית כל&nbsp;פרי האדמה, “you are to take from the first fruit of the soil, etc.,”&nbsp;I might have thought that the word פרי refers only to the&nbsp;actual fruit; how would I know that the commandment also&nbsp;applies to the liquids squeezed from the fruit? The word:&nbsp;תביא, “you are to bring,” is the clue. What is the difference&nbsp;between the fruit itself and its liquids? When bringing the fruit&nbsp;itself the benedictions written in the paragraph referred to&nbsp;from Deuteronomy are to be recited by the farmer, whereas&nbsp;when presenting only their liquids these benedictions do not&nbsp;have to be recited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This legislation has been written after the Torah had written in verse 18 that the Passover sacrifice must not be&nbsp;offered when it is still permissible to eat leavened matters, to&nbsp;tell us that the earliest possible time for offering such first&nbsp;ripened fruit is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">after </span><span class="font5">the Passover, i.e. the day after when the&nbsp;first of the barley harvest is offered. (Compare Leviticus&nbsp;23,9-14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו</span><span class="font5">, “Do not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.” The reason this verse has been inserted here is that&nbsp;generally speaking during the pilgrimage festivals a great&nbsp;amount is consumed, the Torah reminds us that this law is&nbsp;not to be ignored. [It has been written on two other&nbsp;occasions also. Ed.],</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הנה אנכי שולח מלאך לפניך</span><span class="font5">, “I am about to send an&nbsp;angel ahead of you, etc.” This is a departure from what had&nbsp;been the case up until now. G’d announces that as long as&nbsp;all the Israelites remain loyal to Him, He </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">personally</span><span class="font5"> will lead&nbsp;them on their journey to the Holy Land; when they are guilty&nbsp;of trespassing, instead of leading them personally, He will&nbsp;assign that task to an angel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of this verse: The “angel” referred to is Joshua, who after the Israelites’ 40 year stay in&nbsp;the desert and Moses’ death will, take over from him. In&nbsp;other words, G’d does not continue with a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">celestial</span><span class="font5"> creature&nbsp;after Moses’ death, but with a human one. [It is a hint that&nbsp;the period of the Israelites’ lives being guided by&nbsp;supernatural forces only, to wit the manna from heaven, will&nbsp;come to an end at that time. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Actually, G’d had not spoken of sending an angel until after the episode with the golden calf. (Exodus 33,2) Moses,&nbsp;i.e. the people were not content with this even then. (Exodus&nbsp;33,12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.21. כי לא ישא לפשעכם כי שמי בקרבו</span><span class="font5">, “for he has no authority to forgive your deliberate sins, as My Name is&nbsp;within him.” G’d means that even though he (that angel) is a&nbsp;celestial creature, and therefore Divine, He cannot “forgive”&nbsp;any trespass against Him. Another place in the Bible where&nbsp;we encounter a similar thought is Psalms 25,11, למען שמך&nbsp;וסלחת לעוני כי רב הוא, “as befits </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Your name</span><span class="font5">, o Lord, pardon my&nbsp;iniquity.” Other examples of “irregularities” in treatment, are&nbsp;Genesis 48,14, where Yaakov insisted in giving preferential&nbsp;treatment to Ephrayim although Menashe was the firstborn.&nbsp;Another example is found in Psalms 74,20-21: הבט לברית כי&nbsp;מלאו מחשכי ארץ נאום חמס וגו', “Look to the covenant, for the&nbsp;dark places of the land are full of the haunts of lawlessness.&nbsp;Let not the downtrodden turn away disappointed, let the poor&nbsp;and needy praise Your name.” [Here the people ask to be&nbsp;promoted instead of being demoted. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי שמי בקרבו</span><span class="font5">, seeing that My name is within him, he has the right to speak of himself by proclaiming: “'אני ה,” “I am the&nbsp;Lord,” meaning I am His general manager of the universe,&nbsp;known in kabbalistic parlance as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mattatron.</span><span class="font5"> That name can&nbsp;be understood as “chief of the angels,” or “G’d in miniature.”&nbsp;(Compare a book by Rabbi Reuben Margolies, in which all&nbsp;the names of the angels and their functions are listed, pages&nbsp;73-108.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי אם שמוע תשמע</span><span class="font5">, “for if you will carefully obey his&nbsp;instructions, I will be the enemy of your enemies, etc.” A king&nbsp;expects that his subjects will treat his representative as if he&nbsp;himself were present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואיבתי את אויבך</span><span class="font5">, “I will be an enemy to your enemies;” G’d does not refer here to the Canaanite tribes of whom He&nbsp;says He will annihilate them, as He will give their land to the&nbsp;Israelites, but He speaks of enemies upon whom the&nbsp;Israelites have no designs at all. Elsewhere, the Torah has&nbsp;instructed the Israelites not to leave a single soul alive in the&nbsp;Canaanite cities of the seven tribes mentioned.&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 20,16).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ילך</span><span class="font5">, for he will walk, etc.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'והאביאך אל האמורי ואל החתי וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and He will bring you to the Emorite, the Hittite, etc.;” the Torah did not bother to&nbsp;include the smallest of these tribes i.e. the Girgashite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תשתחוה</span><span class="font5">, “Do not prostrate yourself, etc.” in&nbsp;Exodus 20,5 the Torah had warned the Israelites not to&nbsp;prostrate themselves to their own deities, whereas now it&nbsp;warns them not to do so to the deities of these other nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וברך את לחמך ואת מימך</span><span class="font5">, “He will bless your bread&nbsp;and your water.” A blessing of a general nature; the term לחם&nbsp;is a synonym for food of any kind, and the term מים for any&nbsp;drinkable liquids. Compare the use of these words in Hoseah&nbsp;2,7: לחצי ומימי, “my food and drink.” In the same book in&nbsp;chapter 2,11, the prophet speaks of G’d retaliating by taking&nbsp;away from the sinful Israelites: ולקחתי בעתו את דגני ואת תירושי&nbsp;במועדי, “I will deprive them at the appropriate time of JMy </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">grain&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">(harvest) and My </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">grape</span><span class="font5"> (harvest).” If only water had been&nbsp;meant, the prophet should have quoted G’d as saying: “My&nbsp;water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והסירותי מחלה מקרבך</span><span class="font5">, “I will remove sickness from your midst.” In other words, “you will be healthy;” for what good is&nbsp;food to a sick person who cannot enjoy it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את מספר ימיך אמלא</span><span class="font5">, “I will let you enjoy the full&nbsp;number of days of your lives.” You will die at a ripe old age,&nbsp;ready to do so as was described at the death of Avraham&nbsp;and Yitzchok [Genesis 25,8 and Genesis 35,29. Ed.]&nbsp;Concerning the lifetime of the wicked, Solomon quotes G’d&nbsp;as saying: ושנות רשעים תקצורנה, “but the years of the wicked&nbsp;will be shortened;” (Proverbs 10,27).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את אימתי</span><span class="font5">, “the fear of Me;” this is G’d’s reply to&nbsp;Moses’ request in Exodus 15,16: תפול עליהם אימתה ופחד, “may&nbsp;fear and terror befall them!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כל העם אשר תבא בהם, “any nation that you will come upon;” even those nations that are not part of the seven&nbsp;Canaanite tribes. The end of this paragraph proves that this&nbsp;is the correct meaning, when the Torah writes (verse 33)&nbsp;“they must not live on your land lest they lead you into sin so&nbsp;that you would worship their deities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,28 </span><span class="font5">ושלחתי את הצרעה, “I will dispatch the hornets, etc.; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this is a category of stinging wasp which&nbsp;never crossed the river Jordan. Concerning what is written in&nbsp;the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 36, that we read here that G’d will&nbsp;drive out the hornets from the land of the Chivi and the&nbsp;Canaanite, who lives on the West bank of the Jordan, so that&nbsp;they must first have been there or how else could be driven&nbsp;out from there?, The Talmud suggests two different solutions&nbsp;to this apparent contradiction; one that there were two&nbsp;different types of hornets, one in Moses’ time, another in&nbsp;Joshua’s time; (Joshua 24,12). one scholar in the Talmud&nbsp;claims that when the Israelites were on the east bank of the&nbsp;river Jordan ready to cross, the Lord caused the hornets on&nbsp;the other side to become frightened and to leave.&nbsp;Alternately, the entire verse is a simile telling the Jewish&nbsp;people that they will not have to expel the local inhabitants&nbsp;by fighting them with the sword, but that G’d will see to it that&nbsp;they need not worry about sustaining casualties when trying&nbsp;to conquer these lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,31. ושתי את גבולך מים סוף ועד ים פלשתים</span><span class="font5">, “I will set your&nbsp;boundaries from the Sea of Reeds until the Sea of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Philistines.” The “Sea of Reeds” is the eastern boundary and the “Sea of the Philistines, is the western boundary. This has&nbsp;also been expressed differently in Isaiah 9,11: as ארם מקדם&nbsp;ופלשתים מאחור </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">Aram in the front and the Philistines in the&nbsp;rear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וממדבר</span><span class="font5">, “and from the desert;” this refers to the desert in the south which the Israelites were crossing for 40 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועד הנהר, </span><span class="font5">and as far north as the river Euphrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators say that what is written from verse 10 in our verse i.e. שש שנים תזרע until verse 31 כי יהיה לך&nbsp;למוקש, “for it will become a snare for you,” has been added&nbsp;after Moses had returned from the Mountain the third time&nbsp;when G’d had forgiven the Jewish people for the sin of the&nbsp;golden calf, whereas what has been written in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Ki&nbsp;Tissa:</span><span class="font5"> “here My angel will walk ahead of you,” all the way&nbsp;until verse 26,in chapter 34: “do not boil a kid in its mother’s&nbsp;milk had been written at the end of Moses’ stay on Mount&nbsp;Sinai during the first 40 days, whereas what has been written&nbsp;here is because Moses wished to conclude the subject with&nbsp;the legislation of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> year and the pilgrimage&nbsp;festivals, followed by the injunction not to boil a kid in its&nbsp;mother’s milk, followed by the passage about the angel and&nbsp;the arrival in the Holy land. This is parallel to what he had&nbsp;done at the end of the first 40 days. From here on the&nbsp;paragraphs follow a haphazard pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,1. ואל משה אמר</span><span class="font5">, “and He had said to Moses:” this paragraph up to and including verse 4: 'את כל דברי ה, “all the&nbsp;words of the Lord,” were said to him on the fourth day of&nbsp;Sivan, [two days before the revelation, Ed.] as I have&nbsp;explained at the time. (19,15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning of the text, an angel had said this to Moses at this time; the text is abbreviated,&nbsp;and is one of many such verses in the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,3. ויבא משה</span><span class="font5">, “Moses arrived, etc;” in the camp of the Israelites, after descending from the Mountain. He&nbsp;proceeded to tell the people all that G’d had told him,&nbsp;commencing with the words: 19,4) אתם ראיתם) up to now.”&nbsp;There follows: 24,4) וישכם בבקר) until ויאכלו וישתו, “they ate&nbsp;and they drank” (verse 11) something that occurred on the&nbsp;fifth day of Sivan as I have explained on the relevant verse in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Yitro.</span><span class="font5"> (19,15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושתים עשרה מצבה</span><span class="font5">, “and 12 stone pillars;” this refers&nbsp;to G’d’s commandment to mark off the area at the bottom of&nbsp;Mount Sinai beyond which none of the people were allowed&nbsp;to approach. (19,12) 3 pillars in the east for the three tribes&nbsp;encamped there, three pillars in the south, the west and the&nbsp;north, as they were encamped also while in the desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators say that Moses placed 12 stone pillars on the altar as a symbol that all twelve tribes were&nbsp;completely content with maintaining the covenant with&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span><span class="font5"> We find a parallel to this in what the prophet Elijah&nbsp;did on Mount Carmel: ויקחו שתים עשרה אבנים למספר בני ישראל</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5">they took twelve stones to symbolize the twelve tribes of&nbsp;Israel.” (Kings I 18,31.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נערי בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “young men of the Children of&nbsp;Israel.” They were young lads on the threshold of becoming&nbsp;of age when they would be eligible to observe the&nbsp;commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to a different view, these were all firstborns of their respective families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויעלו עולות</span><span class="font5">, “they presented burnt-offerings.” They meant to fulfill what G’d had told Moses at the burning bush&nbsp;that the Israelites would in due course worship him at that&nbsp;Mountain. (Exodus 3,12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישם באגנות</span><span class="font5">, “he placed it in basins.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explains that we learn from this verse that it requires three&nbsp;steps to convert to Judaism fully: circumcision, immersion in&nbsp;a ritual bath, and expressing one’s willingness to become&nbsp;Jewish by a verbal declaration. This explains a statement in&nbsp;the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> folio 46, that our forefathers,&nbsp;i.e. Avraham, Yitzchok, and Yaakov, were circumcised and&nbsp;immersed themselves in a ritual bath, but did not make a&nbsp;verbal declaration of accepting Judaism. [How could they&nbsp;have done so since the Torah had not been given in their&nbsp;time as yet? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זרק על המזבח</span><span class="font5">, “he sprinkled on the altar.” He did so before reading out the declaration for the people to recite&nbsp;after him. After having read out the declaration he sprinkled&nbsp;the other half of the sacrificial blood on the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקח ספר הברית, “</span><span class="font5">He took hold of the Book of the&nbsp;Covenant;” It is well known that the Torah was not written in&nbsp;chronological sequential order. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> of Rabbi&nbsp;Yishmael, on the 19th chapter of the Book of Exodus, has&nbsp;proven this beyond any question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among other proofs the author has cited is Leviticus 25,2, where the Torah wrote: ושבתה הארץ, that the soil of the&nbsp;land of Israel is to observe a year of lying fallow,&nbsp;(immediately after the Israelites entering that land) and the&nbsp;Torah proceeds to lists the laws pertaining to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">cycles followed by the Jubilee cycles, concluding with 26,46:&nbsp;“these are the statutes and social laws that G’d has given as&nbsp;applying to the Jewish people all of which He had revealed&nbsp;to Moses at Mount Sinai.” The Jewish people heard and&nbsp;accepted all the laws including the blessings and curses&nbsp;applying to those who observed them and those who would&nbsp;disobey them, after which Moses took the remainder of the&nbsp;blood and sprinkled it upon them, as the seal of the&nbsp;covenant. He told the people to listen to detailed instructions&nbsp;of these laws starting on the day following. [In other words,&nbsp;the Jews had already bound themselves to be obedient to&nbsp;the Torah’s laws even though they had not yet been written&nbsp;down. There is considerable discussion about the term ספר&nbsp;הברית, here whether what was already written in there at the&nbsp;time Moses read from it was subsequently written in the&nbsp;Torah out of context or not. According to our author’s&nbsp;interpretation of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechilta</span><span class="font5"> when the Israelites said their&nbsp;famous: נעשה ונשמע generally understood as their giving G’d&nbsp;a blank cheque, this was not so, they simply expressed the&nbsp;wish to learn the details of what Moses had already read out&nbsp;to them. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הנה דם הברית</span><span class="font5">, “here is the blood, the symbol of the&nbsp;covenant;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The blood of the covenant is divided into two halves, as always when a covenant is made between two parties.&nbsp;We know this already from the first covenant made between&nbsp;G’d and Avraham in Genesis chapter 15, when Avraham&nbsp;divided all the slaughtered animals except for the bird.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Nowadays when two parties conclude an agreement each receives a copy of the text, and each signs both copies. Ed.]&nbsp;The prophet Jeremiah, in Jeremiah 34,18, refers to העגל אשר&nbsp;כרתו לשנים ויעברו בין בתריו, “the calf which they cut in two so as&nbsp;to pass between the halves.” The reason why in Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">15,17, G’d is not described as passing between the pieces&nbsp;Avraham had cut, was His way of indicating to Avraham that&nbsp;there would be a price to pay in blood for violating this&nbsp;covenant. This idea has also been referred to again in&nbsp;Leviticus 26,25 in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tochachah,</span><span class="font5"> the chapter of dire&nbsp;warnings, where G’d describes His reaction to when the&nbsp;Jewish people become guilty of violating this covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,10. ויראו את אלוקי ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “they saw a vision of the Lord, G’d of Israel.” This was a prophetic vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כמעשה לבנת ספיר</span><span class="font5">, “like a brick make of sapphire.” There are two kinds of sapphire, the white kind and the black kind.&nbsp;The “white, (bright)” kind is similar in colour to azure-blue;&nbsp;seeing that the majority of people have never seen a&nbsp;sapphire in their lives, the Torah has to describe it by&nbsp;comparing it to a phenomenon familiar to everyone, i.e. a&nbsp;cloudless sky in which the sun shines brightly. We find such&nbsp;a description also in Job 37,21: ורוח עברה ותטהרם, “until the&nbsp;wind comes and clears the sky from the clouds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Akiva is quoted as referring to when Pharaoh forced the Israelites to deliver twice the normal amount of&nbsp;bricks, by thus interpreting the word תוכן in Exodus 5,18.&nbsp;They had refused to continue to supply the Israelites with the&nbsp;straw that served as reinforcement for mud bricks, so that&nbsp;the Israelites had to forage for them in the fields. They&nbsp;gathered straw full of thorns and thistles and the skins of&nbsp;their feet were pierced by that straw, blood streaming from&nbsp;their wounds, and was mixed with the loam. (The raw&nbsp;material of the bricks.) According to this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> the source&nbsp;of which is not known, a descendant of Metushelach, called&nbsp;Rachel in that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> experienced extreme difficulty and&nbsp;pain while about to give birth, her birthstool, מלבן, a&nbsp;rectangular mould-like contraption, becoming mired in loam&nbsp;and thistles and she being bloodied all over. When the&nbsp;archangel Michael became aware of this result of the&nbsp;barbaric treatment of the Israelites by the decree of Pharaoh,&nbsp;he took a brick, לבנה, same root in Hebrew, and deposited&nbsp;this brick made of sapphire beneath the throne of G’d to&nbsp;remind Him of how His people were being treated. It&nbsp;remained there until the destruction of the Temple due to the&nbsp;people’s sins when G’d or one of His angels flung it back&nbsp;down to earth, as G’d had no further use for such reminders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[I had debated with myself if to translate and explain the author’s insertion of part of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> but decided in&nbsp;favour, as it illustrates better than prose how our sages view&nbsp;both the angels, and G’d’s reaction to excessive torture of&nbsp;His people, but also excessive disloyalty by His people to&nbsp;their covenant with G’d. Ed.] (In his commentary on our&nbsp;verse by Rabbi Menachem Kasher of sainted memory, in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah,</span><span class="font5"> the interested reader can read up on this&nbsp;under the heading #88. (With the help of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;line: ותחת רגליו כמעשה לבנת הספיר וכעצם השמים לטוהר, “and&nbsp;underneath His feet the mould of a brick pure as the finest&nbsp;sapphire, like a cloudless pure sky,” becomes more&nbsp;meaningful.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,11. לא שלח ידו</span><span class="font5">, “He did not raise His hand;” G’d had&nbsp;reason to punish the people who had been granted this&nbsp;vision because they carried on as if this was nothing&nbsp;extraordinary, by eating and drinking. [According to this&nbsp;interpretation, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">at this time,</span><span class="font5"> immediately before the giving of&nbsp;the Torah, G’d did not wish to spoil the joyous mood of the&nbsp;people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate approach to these lines: all the Torah tells us is that in spite of having been granted such visions, and&nbsp;one could have expected that this would have made them&nbsp;temporarily like angels, like Moses who on Mount Sinai went&nbsp;for 40 days and nights without food or drink, these “nobles”&nbsp;of the people had not attained that level of prophecy. They&nbsp;could continue to eat and drink without thereby harming&nbsp;themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחזו את האלוהים, </span><span class="font5">according to Rabbi Tanchuma, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Vayikra Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 20,10) they had behaved arrogantly&nbsp;craning their necks, etc., acting inappropriately and trying to&nbsp;translate their vision into something terrestrial, such as&nbsp;physically enjoying food and drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאכלו וישתו, “</span><span class="font5">they ate and drank,” just as we know from Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov, that when they made a pact&nbsp;with human beings, they invariably sealed it by having a&nbsp;festive meal with their partner. (Ibn Ezra) This whole verse&nbsp;was inserted in the Torah in honour of Moses who, when&nbsp;experiencing prophetic visions did not need to sustain his&nbsp;body by food and drink, as he had attained the level of&nbsp;disembodied beings who do not depend on such means to&nbsp;renew energy they had spent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “they ate;” they ate of the peace offerings mentioned in verse 5 of our chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהושע משרתו</span><span class="font5">, “whereas his personal valet,&nbsp;Joshua, etc.;” he remained seated at the bottom of the&nbsp;Mountain until his master would return; in the meantime he&nbsp;was fed daily by a portion of manna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואל הזקנים</span><span class="font5">, “and to the elders, the ones who had&nbsp;enjoyed the vision of the Divine,’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבו לנו</span><span class="font5">, “remain seated here for us;” the “us” refers to Moses and Joshua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בזה</span><span class="font5">, “inside the camp;” Joshua had been permitted to approach more closely to the bottom of the Mountain than&nbsp;either Aaron, Chur, and the seventy elders. This is why&nbsp;Joshua had been unaware of what had transpired with the&nbsp;golden calf until he returned together with Moses.</span></p>

'וישכון כבוד ה</span><span class="font5">, “the glory of the Lord abode;” actually it had already settled on the Mountain, as we know&nbsp;from Exodus 19,20: וירד ה׳ על הר סיני, “the Lord descended&nbsp;onto Mount Sinai;” it had also stated that “Moses had&nbsp;approached the thick cloud which enveloped the higher&nbsp;regions of the Mountain beyond which was G’d’s presence.”&nbsp;(Exodus 20,18).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,18. ויעל אל ההר</span><span class="font5">, “he ascended towards the Mountain.” He ascended all the way to the top of the&nbsp;Mountain.

If the people were to hear&nbsp;these laws first, their desire to get to that land would become&nbsp;reinforced. After all, taking possession of that land was the&nbsp;reward for observing the laws of the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארבעים יום וארבעים לילה</span><span class="font5">, “forty days and forty nights.” These days commenced with the morning of the seventh day&nbsp;of Sivan, and ended with the morning of the seventeenth day&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tammuz.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat T’rumah</span></h1>

<p><span class="font5">תקחו </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את תרומתי</span><span class="font5">, “you are to take (accept) My contribution.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that this contribution consisted&nbsp;of 13 different types of materials. They are the following:&nbsp;gold, silver, copper; blue, purple and crimson yarns; fine&nbsp;linen, goat’s hair, ram skins, skins of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">techashim,</span><span class="font5"> acacia&nbsp;wood; oil for incense and oil for lighting; and the princes were&nbsp;to supply the gemstones for the High Priest’s garments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועזים</span><span class="font5">, “and goats’ hair,” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> He&nbsp;bases himself on Onkelos who translates: ומעזי, “something&nbsp;derived from goats;” anyone translating the word ועזים, as&nbsp;“and goats,” is in error therefore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועצי שטים</span><span class="font5">, “and (boards of) acacia trees.” There&nbsp;were forests in the desert in which these trees grew. This is&nbsp;why the Israelites were described as dwelling at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shittim,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">(Numbers 25,1) The wood of these trees is light in weight&nbsp;and pleasant to look at. The 48 boards of the Tabernacle, as&nbsp;well as the pillars at the entrance and between the Sanctuary&nbsp;and the Holy of Holies were constructed of that wood and&nbsp;transported on the wagons donated by the princes as per&nbsp;Numbers 3,36-34 and 4,31-32. So were the bolts that were&nbsp;attached to link the boards to one another. They were all&nbsp;transported on these four wagons which were pulled by eight&nbsp;oxen under the supervision of the Levites from the family of&nbsp;Merari. (Numbers 7,8) Seeing that the boards were ten cubits&nbsp;(six meters) long each and one and a half cubits thick, it is&nbsp;extremely likely that the wood from which they were cut was&nbsp;light in weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שמן למאור</span><span class="font5">, “oil for lighting;” since it is not&nbsp;customary for a king to enter his palace until the palace is&nbsp;complete and its furnishings are in place, as well as the&nbsp;illumination having been lit, this is mentioned already here.&nbsp;The same oil was also used for anointing all the sacred&nbsp;vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בשמים</span><span class="font5">, ‘fragrant spices;” these were mixed with the oil for anointing; Kings are in the habit of providing their palaces&nbsp;with aromatic fragrances before they take up residence in&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולקטורת הסמים</span><span class="font5">, “and for the aromatic incense;” this verse has been inverted. We must understand it as if the Torah had&nbsp;written: והסמים לקטורת, “and the spices for the aromatic&nbsp;incense.” It does not mean: “spices </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">needed for</span><span class="font5"> the aromatic&nbsp;incense, seeing that the aromatic incense consisted only of&nbsp;these aromatic spices.” Verses 30,34-35 in Exodus make this&nbsp;quite clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אבני שוהם</span><span class="font5">, “gemstones called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shoham.”</span><span class="font5"> These two&nbsp;were affixed to the apron-like garment of the High Priest&nbsp;known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ephod,”</span><span class="font5"> as well as the gemstones to be inserted in&nbsp;the High Priest’s breastplate, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">choshen,</span><span class="font5"> (12 in number).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשו לי מקדש</span><span class="font5">, “they will construct a Holy Temple for&nbsp;Me.” A building designated for meetings at appointed times.&nbsp;Compare: בית מועד. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span><span class="font5"> Compare also Numbers&nbsp;11,18: התקדשו למחר, “be prepared for tomorrow.” We also&nbsp;have an announcement by G’d in Exodus 29,43: ונועדתי לבני&nbsp;ישראל, “I will keep my appointment with the Children of&nbsp;Israel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכן תעשו</span><span class="font5">, “and this is how you shall do it.” The&nbsp;letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ו </span><span class="font5">at the beginning of the word וכן, is not necessary in&nbsp;this context;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">some commentators understand it as referring to what follows about the construction of the individual items of&nbsp;furniture for the Temple. The idea of the connective letter ו&nbsp;then would be: ”just as I instructed you first to build the&nbsp;structure, I will now instruct you to construct the furnishings&nbsp;to be housed in that structure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשו ארון</span><span class="font5">, “they shall construct an ark;” the&nbsp;introductory letter ו in the word ועשו tells us that, of course,&nbsp;the building </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">housing</span><span class="font5"> this ark had by that time already been&nbsp;constructed. As long as the building had not been&nbsp;constructed there was no place where to put the ark. We find&nbsp;a similar problem in Deuteronomy 10,1, when Moses recalls&nbsp;that G’d had told him to carve out the tablets on which the&nbsp;Ten Commandments would be inscribed a second time, and&nbsp;he constructed the ark first as he said himself in verse 3 in&nbsp;that chapter where he said: “I made an ark and then I carved&nbsp;out the Tablets.” This was not in accordance in which G’d&nbsp;had instructed him to proceed in verse 9 of our chapter. He&nbsp;had even reminded him that He had shown him an illustration&nbsp;of how to proceed, in that verse. If the Torah nonetheless&nbsp;reports matters in the reverse order, it is because we must&nbsp;remember to put first things first, i.e. that the structure would&nbsp;have been meaningless if not for the furnishings which it was&nbsp;to provide a home for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Our author does not apparently accept the view of the commentators who claim that Moses had forgotten the right&nbsp;order and that Betzalel had to remind him when he received&nbsp;instructions he did not consider logical. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וצפית אותו זהב, </span><span class="font5">“you are to cover it with gold.” The&nbsp;ark was actually designed to be constructed completely of&nbsp;pure gold, but it would have been too heavy to carry,&nbsp;especially since the Torah had commanded the sons of&nbsp;Kehat to carry it on their shoulders. Compare Numbers 7,9.&nbsp;We find that the altar was also hollow and filled with earth,&nbsp;presumably for the same consideration. (Exodus 27,8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">טהור</span><span class="font5">, “pure;” not containing any foreign particles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זר זהב סביב, </span><span class="font5">“surrounded by crown like golden molding.” The purpose of this was to cover the wooden center part at&nbsp;the top completely. The wooden interior was to remain&nbsp;invisible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויצקת לו ארבע טבעות זהב</span><span class="font5">, “you shall pour four&nbsp;golden rings for it.” According to the plain meaning these&nbsp;were small rings which were actually an integral part of the&nbsp;outer wall of the ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על ארבע </span><span class="font5">פעמותיו, “on its four sides. There is another explanation which understands the word פעמון, as leg, in the&nbsp;sense of feet taking steps. Compare Song of Songs 7,2: מה&nbsp;יפו פעמיך בנעלים, “how lovely are your feet in sandals?, or&nbsp;Isaiah 26,6: רגלי עני פעמי דלים, “by the feet of the needy, the&nbsp;soles of the poor.” According to this view it would not be&nbsp;appropriate for the Holy Ark to stand directly on the floor.&nbsp;There would be also two large rings as housings for the&nbsp;staves by which the Ark would be carried on the shoulders of&nbsp;the Kehatites while the people were wandering. These were&nbsp;lowered with the small rings permanently attached to the&nbsp;walls of the ark, as G’d did not wish for the carriers of the Ark&nbsp;to come into direct contact with the Ark while inserting the&nbsp;staves through the rings. [Once inserted, the staves were&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span><span class="font5"> to be removed from the Ark. Ed.] (verse 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על צלעו האחת, ושתי טבעות על צלעו השנית</span><span class="font5">, “on one of its sides and two rings on its opposite side.” In other words,&nbsp;seeing that there were four sides, on the four corners. The&nbsp;ark was positioned inside the Holy of Holies with its longer&nbsp;side facing north. so that the carriers would walk on its&nbsp;eastern and western side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,15. לא יסורו ממנו, “</span><span class="font5">they shall not be removed from it.” In the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma,</span><span class="font5"> folio 72, the question is raised&nbsp;that seeing the Torah had already written: “the staves for&nbsp;carrying the Ark are to be affixed to the Ark,” and it had&nbsp;instructed its craftsmen to insert the staves through these&nbsp;rings, its appears that the purpose was to insert these staves&nbsp;only when the need arose to carry the Ark. This could only be&nbsp;done if they were to be inserted from time to time when the&nbsp;occasion demanded this? The staves in the process of lifting&nbsp;the Ark or lowering it would slip out of the rings! How could&nbsp;the commandment never to remove them be possible to be&nbsp;observed? Answer: The staves were thicker at their&nbsp;respective ends so that they could only just fit through the&nbsp;rings, whereas in the middle they were thinner. [The reader&nbsp;who is interested in the mechanics of this is referred to the&nbsp;commentary by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Or Hachayim</span><span class="font5"> on this verse, or on my&nbsp;translation of it on pages 775-776. Ed.] This is also how&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains the problem in his commentary on the Talmud&nbsp;on this folio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: both in this instance and again in Exodus 40,18, it was Moses who had to insert the&nbsp;staves through the rings. In the Book of Numbers 4,5-6&nbsp;however, we read that Aaron and his sons were to position&nbsp;the ark inside the Tabernacle as well as to position its staves&nbsp;in the proper places. The commandment for the staves not to&nbsp;be moved only came into force at that time. Alternately,&nbsp;although Moses had placed the staves through the rings&nbsp;(without having been instructed to so), G’d wished for this to&nbsp;be done by Aaron and his sons who were priests. It was at&nbsp;that point that the Holy Ark attained the pinnacle of its&nbsp;holiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact is that even during the Israelites march through the desert there were only a few days during which the&nbsp;people were on the march, whereas during more than 99% of&nbsp;the time the people and the Tabernacle remained stationary&nbsp;in a part of the Tabernacle that even the High Priest only&nbsp;entered one single time during the year. (four times during&nbsp;that day). During all this time, there was no need for the&nbsp;staves to be attached to the Ark This is why the Torah wrote&nbsp;in Exodus 27,7 בשאת אותו, “when it is being carried.” (the&nbsp;altar)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.16. </span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתת אל הארון וגו, </span><span class="font5">“you are to deposit inside the Ark, etc;” this verse provides the justification for the words&nbsp;written earlier that the Ark be treated with the utmost&nbsp;reverence. This was because it contained the Tablets upon&nbsp;which the words of the covenant between G’d and the Jewish&nbsp;people had been written by G’d himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word אל here has been chosen instead of the prefix letter ב, which means “in,” or “into.” This is not a unique&nbsp;construction as we have found it also in Exodus 15,25: וישלך&nbsp;אל המים, “he threw it into the water,” as well as in Numbers&nbsp;19,6: אל תוך שרפת הפרה, “into the fire consuming the cow;” or&nbsp;Numbers 19,17: מים חיים אל כלי, “fresh water from a well into a&nbsp;vessel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית כפרת</span><span class="font5">, “you are to construct a lid;” the Torah&nbsp;did not give measurements for the thickness of this lid,&nbsp;seeing that only the surface of it would be visible. The height&nbsp;of the outer golden wall of the Ark would completely enclose&nbsp;its depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שנים כרובים</span><span class="font5">, “two cherubs.” Compare Ezekiel</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">28,14, את כרוב ממשח הסוכך, “like a cherub with outstretched&nbsp;wings;” they are a certain type of bird. Seeing that birds are&nbsp;both clean animals and move in a clean atmosphere most of&nbsp;the time; even though the Torah-in the second of the Ten&nbsp;Commandments- had expressly forbidden us to make&nbsp;anything that is like creatures on earth or in the sky, the&nbsp;reason why the making of the cherubs is exempt from this&nbsp;was that it was not made to be worshipped, but to remain&nbsp;hidden inside the most inaccessible part of the Temple. We&nbsp;have a parallel of this in Isaiah 6,1-2 where the prophet&nbsp;described having had a vision of the Lord seated on His&nbsp;throne surrounded by such creatures each having six wings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even in the Torah we find exceptions to overriding commands, such as “anyone who performs forbidden work&nbsp;on the Sabbath being guilty of legal execution,” (Exodus&nbsp;35,2) while the priests performed such work in the Temple&nbsp;every Sabbath when offering the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">daily</span><span class="font5"> communal sacrifices.&nbsp;Not only that, even individuals, when becoming fathers of a&nbsp;boy baby born on the Sabbath circumcised him on the&nbsp;following Sabbath. (Leviticus 18,16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah strictly forbade marrying the wife of a brother, but made an exception if said brother had died&nbsp;without children, and encouraged a surviving brother to&nbsp;marry the widow who had been his brother’s wife in order to&nbsp;provide him with issue. Similar exceptions are in place for&nbsp;wearing wool garments with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzitzit,</span><span class="font5"> ritual fringes, including&nbsp;wool and linen. There is a positive commandment to this&nbsp;effect (Compare Deuteronomy 22,12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מן הכפרת תעשו</span><span class="font5">, “you shall make them integral&nbsp;parts of the Ark’s lid.” Incidentally, the cherubs constructed in&nbsp;Solomon’s Temple were not mounted on the Ark’s lid. (Kings&nbsp;I 6, 23-27)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;פורשי כנפים</span><span class="font5">, “spreading wings;” to make them look&nbsp;like birds; the reason for this was that birds are viewed as the&nbsp;cleanest creatures (compare what we wrote on verse 18),</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למעלה, </span><span class="font5">“upwards;” above their head; in a posture of modesty and humility. This is matched by the way Isaiah&nbsp;describes his vision of these seraphim covering their bodies&nbsp;with their wings including their faces, (Isaiah 6,2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ופניהם איש אל אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “and they are to face one another;” these details all prove that these cherubs were not intended&nbsp;to be deities to be worshipped, else they would have faced&nbsp;their onlookers so that these could prostrate themselves in&nbsp;front of them. How is this proof? Supposing there had been&nbsp;only one cherub on the lid of the Holy Ark, or if the face of&nbsp;one of them (if there were two) had been turned toward the&nbsp;people, one could have perhaps understood the symbolism&nbsp;as meaning that their purpose was to inspire awe of them in&nbsp;their onlookers. Seeing, however, that they faced each other,&nbsp;is clear proof that they had no interest in any onlooker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, though their wings were pointing upwards, their faces were looking down at the lid, i.e. the space from&nbsp;which G’d’s words would emanate to Moses, and the area in&nbsp;which the Torah was kept. The most important proof that&nbsp;they were not meant to be worshipped by anyone, is the fact&nbsp;that they were in a place that was inaccessible to the people&nbsp;on pain of death. Their function therefore was merely to be&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">servants</span><span class="font5"> of G’d rather than His competitors, just as the&nbsp;cherubs </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(seraphim)</span><span class="font5"> in Isaiah 6,2 were perceived as G’d’s&nbsp;servants standing in attendance before G’d’s throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,21. ונתת את הכפרת על הארון מלמעלה, </span><span class="font5">“you are to&nbsp;position the lid on top of the Ark.” This is followed by the&nbsp;instruction to place the Tablets inside the Ark after G’d would&nbsp;give these to Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How is this to be understood? As of the previous month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ellul,</span><span class="font5"> when Moses had received the second set of Tablets&nbsp;they had rested in the ark which </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Moses</span><span class="font5"> had constructed prior&nbsp;to ascending the Mountain in order to receive them, as&nbsp;pointed out in Deuteronomy 10,3, when he said: “I made an&nbsp;Ark of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shittim</span><span class="font5"> wood, and then I proceeded to carve out the&nbsp;two stone Tablets.” On the 25<sup>th</sup> day of Kislev following, when&nbsp;the construction of the Tabernacle and all its furnishings had&nbsp;been completed, he put the lid on the ark for the first time.&nbsp;This is what the commandment: “place the lid on the Ark,” (in&nbsp;our verse) refers to. The Tablets remained in the ark which&nbsp;Moses had constructed until the first day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5"> when the&nbsp;Tabernacle together with all its furnishings was anointed.&nbsp;Concerning that Ark, the Torah said that Moses was to place&nbsp;the Tablets inside the Holy Ark. This was the Ark constructed&nbsp;by Betzalel. Of this Ark the Torah wrote: ואל הארון תתן את&nbsp;העדות, “and put the Testimony inside </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Ark.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning of the text (according to Ibn Ezra), Moses had already placed the Tablets inside, and&nbsp;after that he placed the lid on the Ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that the lid had been mentioned already several times it states once more that once the lid had been put on&nbsp;the Ark the entire Tabernacle could be considered as having&nbsp;been completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואל הארון תתן את העדות</span><span class="font5">, “and into the Ark you are to place the Testimony.” At this point this was a commandment.&nbsp;Previously when the Torah wrote: ונתת אל הארון, “you will&nbsp;place into the Ark, etc,” we would do well to understand&nbsp;these words as a prediction, or explanation for the purpose of&nbsp;the lid. According to one opinion it would also be an&nbsp;explanation for why the Ark, i.e. with the staves attached to it,&nbsp;were never to be moved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר אתן אליך</span><span class="font5">, “which I am going to give you.” This was a reference to the second set of Tablets, seeing that G’d knew&nbsp;that the first set would never get there in one piece. Not only&nbsp;that, but these words were spoken to Moses on the fortieth&nbsp;day of his last stay on the Mountain. (The first set of Tablets&nbsp;had been smashed on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tammuz)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">25,22.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ודברתי אתך מעל הכפרת</span><span class="font5">, “when I speak to you it will be from above the lid;” you may ask that we read in Leviticus&nbsp;1,1, that “G’d spoke to Moses from the Tent of Meeting,” not&nbsp;from above the lid of the Ark which was inside the Holy of&nbsp;Holies? We must understand the Torah as follows: whenever&nbsp;Moses was standing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">outside </span><span class="font5">the Tabernacle, he perceived&nbsp;the voice of G’d as emanating from inside the Tabernacle.&nbsp;When he was being addressed by G’d while he was inside&nbsp;the Tabernacle G’d’s voice emanated from above the lid of&nbsp;the Ark. This is the meaning of (Numbers 7,89) “when Moses&nbsp;had entered the Tent of Meeting he heard the voice speaking&nbsp;to him from above the lid of the Ark.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת כל אשר אצוה, </span><span class="font5">“and all that I shall command;” in other words: all that G’d plans to command He will communicate to&nbsp;Moses from there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית שלחן, </span><span class="font5">“you are to construct a table;” it is no&nbsp;more than elementary courtesy that the king’s servants and&nbsp;members of his household should eat at his table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וצפית אותו זהב</span><span class="font5">, “you are to cover its surface with&nbsp;gold.” The surface of the table was to be covered by a sheet&nbsp;of gold both on top and underneath it. This would still leave&nbsp;the wood of its legs visible. This is why the Torah added:&nbsp;ועשית זר זהב סביב, “you are to construct a golden molding&nbsp;around it.” This would cover all the exposed wooden parts of&nbsp;the table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית לו מסגרת טפח</span><span class="font5">, “you are to construct for it a&nbsp;rim one handbreadth wide all around.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועשית זר זהב למסגרתו, </span><span class="font5">“you are to make a golden rim as an overlay all the way around the rim.” The first ring the&nbsp;Torah speaks of here was made of wood, just as the table&nbsp;itself. Its golden rim would look like a hollow tube cut open&nbsp;lengthwise, so that the wooden rim would fit inside that&nbsp;golden rim, and its outside would be completely invisible.&nbsp;After completing the instructions no onlooker would be able&nbsp;to see any of the table’s wooden parts. We read in Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">37,11, that Betzalel made both the wooden rim and a golden&nbsp;molding all around it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על ארבע הפאות אשר לארבע רגליו, </span><span class="font5">“(to be fastened) to&nbsp;the four corners of its legs.” Seeing that the dimensions of&nbsp;the table were about 1,2 meters in length and 60 centimeters&nbsp;in width there was enough room for the carriers of the table&nbsp;to position themselves, two in front next to one another and&nbsp;two behind them near the rear end do carry it comfortably,&nbsp;just as they with the Holy Ark, [although the Ark fully loaded&nbsp;weighed over 78000 lbs, which accounts for the fact that the&nbsp;Rabbis say that the Ark had to carry its bearers. This&nbsp;calculation is according to Rabbi Eliyahu </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ki tov,</span><span class="font5"> to the best of&nbsp;this Editor’s memory. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לעומת המסגרת תהיינה</span><span class="font5">, “they (the rings) were&nbsp;attached to the rim at the of the table as holders for the&nbsp;staves, i.e. on the outer edges of the table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית קערותיו</span><span class="font5">, “you are to make its bowls, etc.;” in&nbsp;which to knead the dough for the showbreads which would&nbsp;be displayed on it (the table).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כפותיו</span><span class="font5">, “its ladles,” within which to place the frankincense, between the two rows of the showbreads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וקשותיו</span><span class="font5">, “and its jars;” in which the water for preparing the dough for the showbreads would be kept. קשוה is a&nbsp;vessel as we know from the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> folio 81&nbsp;where the stealing of it is described as so serious a sin that if&nbsp;the thief is caught and killed on the spot by someone&nbsp;incensed at this sin, this is considered as an acceptable&nbsp;punishment, and the person administering it is not&nbsp;considered as having committed murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומנקיותיו</span><span class="font5">, “and its cleansing tools, bowl-shaped used to clean out the oven as well as the surface of the table.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash,i</span><span class="font5"> these were multiple shelf-like structures on each of which one of the showbreads would be&nbsp;placed in a manner that allowed fresh air to circulate around&nbsp;each and thus prevent it from becoming moldy, as they were&nbsp;on display from one Sabbath to the next. They would also&nbsp;protect these thin breads from break into crumbs due to their&nbsp;weight if each had rested on the one beneath it. All this is&nbsp;discussed in the Talmud in minute detail. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Menachot,</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;94) Our author quotes all these details. As the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Torah</span><span class="font5"> did not,&nbsp;and alas in our time we do not possess a Temple, I have&nbsp;decided to omit translating this and refer the interested&nbsp;reader to the Talmud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר יוסך בהן</span><span class="font5">, “wherewith to pour them (the libations).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לחם פנים</span><span class="font5">, breads to be on display, (show-bread(s).) They were called thus as the table was always&nbsp;displaying them. In the Talmud quoted, folio 96, the word פנים&nbsp;is understood as partitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.31.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית מנורת זהב טהור, “you are to construct a&nbsp;candlestick of pure gold;” the function of this candlestick was&nbsp;to provide light for what was on the table. This is why the&nbsp;Torah reports in Exodus 40,24 that Moses positioned the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">menorah</span><span class="font5"> opposite the table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מקשה תיעשה</span><span class="font5">, “it shall be made of hammered work.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> the reason why the word תיעשה here is&nbsp;spelled with an extra letter י in the middle, was in response to&nbsp;difficulties Moses had in understanding how Betzalel would&nbsp;be able to comply with the detailed instructions concerning&nbsp;the candlestick. What puzzled him most of all was that as&nbsp;opposed to all the other furnishings he had not been given a&nbsp;measurement for the height of this candlestick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גביעיה</span><span class="font5">, its cups; all these adornments were to be an integral part of the center shaft, so that if any oil spilled from&nbsp;the top it could be absorbed by the decorations each of&nbsp;which was shaped in, the shape of a receptacle. If the&nbsp;highest one of these became full, the excess could be&nbsp;absorbed by the next lower one, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.37. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית את נרותיה</span><span class="font5">, “and you are to make its lamps&nbsp;etc.;” the reason why the word: ועשית is repeated here is that&nbsp;these lamps were </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">separate</span><span class="font5"> vessels, not part of the shaft and&nbsp;its six arms. Proof of this is provided by the wording: כפתוריהם&nbsp;וקנותם ממנה היו, “its knobs and shaft (only) were all of the&nbsp;same chunk (of gold).” In addition, the Torah uses a separate&nbsp;verse in 37,23 to tell us that Betzalel made these seven&nbsp;lamps. This proves that they were separate vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.37. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נרותיה שבעה</span><span class="font5">, “its lamps seven.” This was to&nbsp;symbolise the seven days of the week, as well as the seven&nbsp;zodiac constellations that provide illumination in the universe;&nbsp;the Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והעלה</span><span class="font5">, “he shall light;” [the priest, as no one else was allowed in there. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את נרותיה, </span><span class="font5">“its lamps.” Seven lamps on the seven arms of the candlestick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והאיר</span><span class="font5">, “it will illuminate,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על ער פניה</span><span class="font5">, “on its front side;” it will give light so that all its shafts/arms will be visible. [The wicks were so arranged&nbsp;that they were directed at the center shaft. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,39. ככר זהב</span><span class="font5">, “one talent of gold.“ (3000 holy shekels in weight, i.e. 6000 shekels, according to the weight of&nbsp;ordinary profane shekels.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,40.וראה ועשה בתבניתם</span><span class="font5">, “note well, and follow their patterns,” (as have been shown to you while on the&nbsp;Mountain.)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת המשכן תעשה עשר יריאות, “</span><span class="font5">and as for the</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Tabernacle itself, make it of ten strips of cloth;” here the Torah speaks of the lower coverings which serves as roof of&nbsp;the structure. They are the ones that are really called משכן,&nbsp;“Tabernacle,” not the skins that were on top and served as&nbsp;protective coverings. These “carpet like” strips of expensive&nbsp;cloth were immediately above the furnishings, the Holy Ark,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menorah,</span><span class="font5"> table and golden altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שש משזר</span><span class="font5">, a linen fabric, each yarn contained 6 threads that had been twisted, (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5">) The Talmud in&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 71 cites proof of this based on Biblical&nbsp;texts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מעשה חושב</span><span class="font5">, work of a weaver. The root of the word חושב shows that it requires extreme thought, i.e. skill, not just&nbsp;dexterity with one’s hands, but planning. When the Torah&nbsp;speaks of מעשה רוקם, however, this refers to needlework only,&nbsp;and is something less sophisticated, not requiring the kind of&nbsp;planning ahead that does weaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אורך היריעה האחת, </span><span class="font5">“the length of each strip of cloth,&nbsp;etc.;” the letter א at the beginning of the word ,האחת, has the&nbsp;vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach,</span><span class="font5"> whereas the second time it has the vowel&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol</span><span class="font5">, and the third time it occurs it again has the vowel&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the Torah speaks of the goats’ skins, we find the same pattern. The rule is that when the letter א in the word&nbsp;אחת had the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach,</span><span class="font5"> and is followed by a word with the&nbsp;separating cantillation mark </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">etnachta,</span><span class="font5"> the next time the word&nbsp;אחת occurs it has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol</span><span class="font5"> if the cantillation marks are&nbsp;either </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">zakef</span><span class="font5"> katan, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sof passuk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.3. חוברות אשה אל אחותה</span><span class="font5">, “shall be joined to one&nbsp;another.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the “joining” is done my means&nbsp;of needle and thread (not clasps or loops). It was not&nbsp;practical to make these coverings out of a single piece of&nbsp;cloth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית לולאות תכלת</span><span class="font5">, you shall make loops of blue&nbsp;wool; G’d commanded that these carpet like coverings be&nbsp;made of two sections in order not to make it too heave and&nbsp;cumbersome to handle. The same method was followed with&nbsp;the carpets made of goats’ hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;חמשים לולאות</span><span class="font5">, fifty loops. The total amount of&nbsp;space for these 50 loops was three and a half cubits. How is&nbsp;this arrived at? When you allow a half cubit of air space to&nbsp;separate the 49 airspaces needed to separate one loop from&nbsp;the next, this amounts to twenty four and a half cubits. This&nbsp;leaves three and a half cubits for the boards to complete the&nbsp;28 cubits in length occupied by them when fastened to one&nbsp;another snugly by the bolts we shall hear about still.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that the eleven carpets made of goats’ hair were a total of thirty cubits in length, you were left with five&nbsp;and a half cubits for the loops, as those were thicker than the&nbsp;loops made of a mixture of wool and linen as described for&nbsp;the previous carpets. [There the Torah had specified that the&nbsp;loops were of the same materials as the carpets; seeing that&nbsp;for the goats’ wool carpets the material for the loops is not&nbsp;specified it is logical that these too were made of the same&nbsp;material as the carpets that they were meant to join. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מקבילות הלולאות</span><span class="font5">, “the loops shall be opposite one another;” this is the way </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands it and he is&nbsp;supported by the text of the Torah. The Torah writes in verse&nbsp;33: ונתת את הפרכת תחת הקרסים, “you are to place (hang) the&nbsp;dividing curtain under the clasps;” if we follow the text of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baraitha,</span><span class="font5"> the position of the dividing curtain was about one&nbsp;cubit beyond (westward) of these clasps. Some&nbsp;commentators explain and answer the difficulty in that&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baraitha</span><span class="font5"> by saying that the pillars supporting the dividing&nbsp;curtain were attached to the end of the twentieth cubit of the&nbsp;length (interior) of the sanctuary part, as opposed to the Holy&nbsp;of Holies part of the Tabernacle. The dividing curtain hung&nbsp;facing the eastern entrance of the Tabernacle. In this way it&nbsp;was beneath the 50 golden </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">clasps </span><span class="font5">described as connecting&nbsp;the primarily blue woolen carpets. The curtain at the eastern&nbsp;entrance of the Tabernacle called מסך, was similarly&nbsp;suspended in a manner that its thickness completed the&nbsp;twenty cubit long sanctuary part of the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 98, where it is stated that none of the carpets covered the pillars at the&nbsp;eastern end of the Tabernacle, the dividing curtain would&nbsp;have been hung towards the western part of the Sanctuary,&nbsp;or Holy of Holies respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,9. וכפלת את היריעה השישית</span><span class="font5">, “you are to fold over the sixth carpet;” when the word כפל occurs without further&nbsp;adjective, it means: “double.” This is what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> meant when&nbsp;he wrote: “half its width was hanging and was folded over the&nbsp;curtain at the eastern entrance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,12. תסרח על אחורי המשכן</span><span class="font5">, “it will overlap the rear end of the Tabernacle.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that it was necessary&nbsp;because the lowest 2 boards at the Western side of&nbsp;Tabernacle which had been left exposed.” Actually, there&nbsp;were no 2 cubits exposed, as the lowest cubit had been&nbsp;inserted into the silver sockets of the Tabernacle. This is in&nbsp;accordance with the view expressed in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baraitha.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">However, according to the opinion we quoted from the&nbsp;Talmud, exposed parts of the boards on the outside of the&nbsp;Western wall of The Tabernacle had been covered by the&nbsp;curtains so that only the sockets had remained exposed and&nbsp;needed to be covered. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All </span><span class="font5">the scholars are agreed however,&nbsp;that the carpets made of goats’ hair covered the outside of&nbsp;the Tabernacle all the way to the ground. This was&nbsp;necessary already for the sake of the honour of the Presence&nbsp;of the Lord in the Tabernacle. The sockets of the Tabernacle&nbsp;to the south and the north remained exposed. Rabbi&nbsp;Yishmael, quoted by the Talmud, compared the Tabernacle&nbsp;to an elegant lady, walking in the marketplace and the train&nbsp;of her dress dragging behind her on the ground. If she were&nbsp;truly elegant, she would make sure that that train is either&nbsp;held up by a servant, or somehow tied to her dress so that it&nbsp;will not be dirtied being dragged along a dusty street. It is&nbsp;reasonable to assume that the corners of the curtains were&nbsp;attached to the fabric in a way preventing them from trailing&nbsp;on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,15. עצי שטים עומדים</span><span class="font5">, “made of acacia wood, upright.” The reason why he Torah added the word: “upright,” was to&nbsp;forbid planks that had already fallen off the tree after the&nbsp;branch having been sawed off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,17.שתי ידוה לקרש אחד</span><span class="font5">, “two square pegs, rung like, for each plank.” Each peg was indented from all four sides so&nbsp;that the “lips” of the plank could fit over each side and be&nbsp;level front and back. When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> wrote (on Shabbat 98) that&nbsp;the pegs were cut out on three sides, he meant that these cut&nbsp;outs faced front and two sides of the next adjoining plank, the&nbsp;one in the middle not being called a “cut out of the peg,” but&nbsp;“a cut out of the plank.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשה אל אחותה</span><span class="font5">, parallel to one another. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">understands this as applying to the thickness of each plank&nbsp;which was one cubit (60 cm. approx). He arrived at this&nbsp;conclusion by basing himself on the two planks at the&nbsp;northwestern end of the Holy of Holies and the southwestern&nbsp;corner. [If his opinion would not be correct, we could not&nbsp;account for the measurements given by the Torah for the&nbsp;overall length and width of the Tabernacle. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,19. שני אדנם תחת הקרש האחד</span><span class="font5">, “two sockets under one (each) plank.” The dimensions of each of these sockets were&nbsp;one cubit in length matching the thickness of each plank and&nbsp;their width was three quarters of a cubit so that two together&nbsp;were the width of each plank, one as a half cubits. Each&nbsp;socket was hollowed out so that it could accommodate the&nbsp;pegs described in detail above. The author proceeds to give&nbsp;further details which in the absence of an illustration are not&nbsp;easy for the reader to follow. [This editor hopes to supply&nbsp;illustrations at the end of the last volume of this Torah&nbsp;commentary. Ed.] There is no unanimity on some of these&nbsp;details, but seeing that regardless of whose opinion is right&nbsp;there will not be another Tabernacle in the future, the dispute&nbsp;will never be resolved satisfactorily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,24. ויהיו תואמים מלמטה</span><span class="font5">, “they shall be matching at the bottom” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> writes as follows on this phrase; “all the planks&nbsp;shall be flush at the bottom, so that the thickness of the&nbsp;edges of the two sockets should not form a gap to distance&nbsp;them from one another” (the planks). The corner planks of&nbsp;the southwestern part of the Tabernacle as well as the one at&nbsp;the northeastern corner had to be worked in such a way that&nbsp;they did not protrude into the interior space of the&nbsp;Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to our author, the words: “northern and southern,” belong further down in his commentary, and he&nbsp;meant to say that the top of the corner plank in the western&nbsp;row was inserted into the ring. When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> wrote that the&nbsp;ring was in the thickness of the plank, he means: in the&nbsp;thickness of the western plank. When you give this some&nbsp;thought, you will realise that that ring was also inserted at the&nbsp;same time into the top of the plank at a ninety degree angle&nbsp;to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל הטבעת האחד</span><span class="font5">, “into the one ring.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi, </span><span class="font5">every plank was cut away a little at the top along its width,&nbsp;two cuts on its two sides to contain the thickness of a ring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,26. </span><span class="font5">ועשית בריחים, “you shall make bolts;” according to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> these bolts were to be attached to the outside of the&nbsp;planks in three rows spread over the height of ten cubits&nbsp;which was their height. Seeing that the Torah had spoken of&nbsp;5 plus five plus five bolts, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> means that they were not&nbsp;each as long as the entire combined length of the planks in&nbsp;each direction, but were inserted through the rings holding&nbsp;the bolts from each end, being 15 cubits long each. There&nbsp;were therefore 4 bolts along the upper half of the long wall,&nbsp;and 4 bolts along the lower part of that wall, and 4 bolts&nbsp;along the western wall (which was 12 cubits wide on the&nbsp;outside.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bolt in the middle, described as הבריח התיכון, “the bolt running centrally all around was long enough to traverse&nbsp;the holes drilled in each plank so that it could go in at the&nbsp;eastern end of the northern wall and come out at the eastern&nbsp;end of the southern wall, (describing a u shaped path.) Since&nbsp;the latter was about 70 cubits plus long, it was equivalent to&nbsp;three of the other bolts. We have examples of how to fasten&nbsp;sections of parchment to one another in a Torah scroll,&nbsp;where the length of the section from top to bottom is sewn at&nbsp;intervals of approximately one third from the top three times,&nbsp;or when the land of Israel is divided into three parts for the&nbsp;purpose of where to position the cities of refuge for people&nbsp;who had killed unintentionally and were afraid of a family&nbsp;member of the deceased wishing to kill him as an act of&nbsp;retribution. (Compare Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah</span><span class="font5"> folio 19, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Makkot 9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,28. בתוך הקרשים</span><span class="font5">, within the planks. Seeing that the&nbsp;other bolts were fastened to the golden outside of the planks&nbsp;and therefore were visible to the eye, the centre bolt which&nbsp;was fastened to the wood underneath the golden overlay,&nbsp;and therefore invisible to the naked eye, was described as&nbsp;“inside the planks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,32. על ארבעה עמודי שטים</span><span class="font5">, “on four pillars made of acacia wood.” These pillars were freestanding, across the&nbsp;width of the Tabernacle they did not bother anyone seeing&nbsp;that only the High Priest one day of the year, the Day of&nbsp;Atonement would walk past them four times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The five pillars at the eastern entrance of the Tabernacle, however, were positioned differently, two each&nbsp;near the northern and southern side, and the fifth in the&nbsp;centre, so that there was plenty of room to walk on either&nbsp;side of the pillar in the middle, as the priests would enter and&nbsp;leave the Sanctuary frequently. If all these pillars had been&nbsp;spaced at equal distances from one another this would have&nbsp;been inconvenient for the priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation, (source unknown) the reason why there were only four pillars supporting the&nbsp;dividing curtain, whereas there were five such pillars&nbsp;supporting the curtain at the entrance of the Tabernacle, is&nbsp;that they were positioned between the planks of the&nbsp;Tabernacle on either side, so that these planks could be&nbsp;used as additional supports for the staves from which the&nbsp;curtain was suspended. These staves rested (also) on top of&nbsp;the plank to the north and south side respectively, so that&nbsp;actually the dividing curtain was supported by six pillars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The curtain at the entrance did not have parts of the planks supporting it. [According to the opinion that the&nbsp;dividing curtain was actually a double curtain so that the High&nbsp;Priest had to walk between it, it would have been much&nbsp;heavier, and therefore in need of stronger support. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The two outer pillars at the entrance, actually functioned as if an addition to the planks, but not joined to&nbsp;them. Our author prefers the first interpretation. Our author&nbsp;queries that if that interpretation were correct what was the&nbsp;purpose of the pillars that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> speaks about? The planks&nbsp;would have been sufficient to support the staves for the&nbsp;curtain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,35. ושמת את השולחן, “</span><span class="font5">you shall place the table, etc.;” in the middle; seeing that the Torah had written that the&nbsp;candlestick should be positioned opposite the table, the&nbsp;golden altar had to be positioned in the centre of the&nbsp;Sanctuary part of the Tabernacle. Both the Candlestick and&nbsp;the table were slightly to the north and south of the centre&nbsp;and at the same time further west, closer to the dividing&nbsp;curtain. Compare Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת המנורה נוכח השולחן, </span><span class="font5">“and the candlestick was facing the table.” This was in order to illuminate the surface of the&nbsp;table. This has been spelled out in Numbers 8,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על צלע המשכן תימנה</span><span class="font5">, “on the southern side of the Tabernacle near the southern wall.” Light always emanates&nbsp;from the south, as does the light of the sun whose orbit&nbsp;proceeds in a southerly direction after it rises in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,5. כרכוב המזבח, </span><span class="font5">“the ledge of the altar</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">comments that we have learned this from the Talmud in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zevachim,</span><span class="font5"> folio 62, where the question is posed: “which was&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Carcov?”</span><span class="font5"> The answer given is that it was a ledge&nbsp;protruding one cubit from the wall of the altar above the&nbsp;mesh, running from one corner of the altar to the next and&nbsp;that there was a space 1 cubit wide underneath it where the&nbsp;priests would walk. Every corner of the altar was surrounded&nbsp;by this walkway one cubit high and one cubit wide, and these&nbsp;are what are called: “the corners of the altar.” On the other&nbsp;hand, the four corners of the altar on top of its platform were&nbsp;cubes one cubit high. The space between them, according to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> was called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Carcov</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,8. נבוב לוחות</span><span class="font5">, “make it hollow with boards;” it was to be hollow underneath in order for it to be lighter when&nbsp;carrying it. These hollowed out boards were inside of the&nbsp;mesh on which blood would be sprinkled, occupying the&nbsp;lower half of the altar. When the Israelites were encamped&nbsp;they would fill the hollow space with earth and offer the&nbsp;sacrifices on top of that earth. When they would move again,&nbsp;the accumulated earth would fall between the boards&nbsp;enclosing that hollowed space and the mesh, which looked&nbsp;like a sieve. Each time the came to rest they would fill that&nbsp;hollow space up with earth again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועמודיו עשרים</span><span class="font5">, “and its pillars shall be twenty 20.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our author wonders why </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> does not mention how</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">many pillars there were in the courtyard. [I suppose the author refers to the Torah not mentioning the number of&nbsp;pillars in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">eastern </span><span class="font5">section of the courtyard, as the Torah&nbsp;gave us the numbers for the other three sides. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.11. וכן לפאת צפון וגו</span><span class="font5">׳, “and likewise on the northern side;” the word: עמדו in this verse is spelled without the&nbsp;customary letter י before the letter ו.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עמודיהם ארבעה</span><span class="font5">, “the number of their pillars to be&nbsp;four.” In the open space of the entrance to the courtyard in&nbsp;the east, there were only three pillars. However, when&nbsp;speaking of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">total </span><span class="font5">number of pillars on the 50 cubits of the&nbsp;eastern side of it there were a total of 11 pillars. When you&nbsp;deduct one pillar each for the north eastern corner or the&nbsp;south eastern corner, whichever you prefer, you are left with&nbsp;ten open spaces for that side, each separated by an open&nbsp;space one cubit wide between each of these pillars. This&nbsp;system continued all the way around the Tabernacle.&nbsp;Eventually, you were left with four empty air spaces and four&nbsp;pillars for the twenty cubits width of the entrance to the&nbsp;courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל עמודי החצר סביב מחושקים כסף</span><span class="font5">, “all the pillars of&nbsp;the courtyard were to be banded with silver. Seeing that&nbsp;these pillars had not been plated with silver as the pillars&nbsp;inside the Tabernacle, they had to be fitted with silver bands&nbsp;(as around wooden caskets for beer or whisky) so that their&nbsp;wood would not crack during sandstorms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.18. ורוחב חמשים בחמשים</span><span class="font5">, “and the width to be fifty cubits throughout;” not literally 50, but 50 cubits from the&nbsp;north to the south, and 49 cubits from the east to the west&nbsp;side of the Tabernacle. The length of the Tabernacle was 30&nbsp;cubits on the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">inside</span><span class="font5">, i.e. 32 cubits on the outside. Likewise&nbsp;the width of the Tabernacle which was 10 cubits on the&nbsp;inside, was 12 cubits wide on the outside. The Tabernacle&nbsp;was erected with its length running parallel to the length of&nbsp;the hangings serving as the walls of the courtyard. Seeing&nbsp;that it was positioned in the center of the width of the&nbsp;courtyard and the hangings and their supporting pillars took&nbsp;up at least half a cubic each, there could not have been more&nbsp;than 49 cubits of open airspace for the width left even for the&nbsp;sections </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">occupied by the Tabernacle itself inside of it.&nbsp;The western section, after deducting the space occupied by&nbsp;the Tabernacle, would not have been more than 19 cubits of&nbsp;open space by 50 cubits, whereas if the space on either side&nbsp;of the Tabernacle was measured from east to west it would&nbsp;have been 100 cubits by 19 cubits of unimpeded space, on&nbsp;either side of the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וקומה חמש אמות שש משזר ואדניהם נחושת</span><span class="font5">, “and its height five cubits of fine twisted linen and their sockets to be of&nbsp;copper.” According to the plain meaning of the text, this&nbsp;phrase has to be understood as follows: the height of the&nbsp;walls of cloth of the courtyard, the “dividers” from less sacred&nbsp;ground around it, are to be five cubits high; this is in addition&nbsp;to the height of the copper sockets of the pillars. In other&nbsp;words, the total height of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mechitzah,</span><span class="font5"> “hanging divider,”&nbsp;was to be six cubits. This is based on the assumption that&nbsp;sockets were usually one cubit in height. In the Talmud,&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zevachim</span><span class="font5"> folio 59, we are told about the width of&nbsp;these hangings, that they were 15 cubits high. How do we&nbsp;reconcile these two statements? The Talmud answers that&nbsp;the height of five cubits mentioned in the Torah refers to how&nbsp;much higher these hangings were than the highest point of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">altar</span><span class="font5"> which was 10 cubits high. This would in agreement&nbsp;of the opinion of Rabbi Yossi, who said that the height of the&nbsp;altar was twice its width. (verse 1 in our chapter.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,19. וכל יתדותיו</span><span class="font5">, “and all its pegs,” at the time when the Tabernacle had first been erected, the carpets which&nbsp;formed its roof were fastened to the surrounding earth by&nbsp;tent-pegs, the other end of which had been fastened to the&nbsp;edges of these carpets. The carpets had to be stretched taut&nbsp;so that they would not fall into the hollow airspace of the&nbsp;Tabernacle due to their weight. Although this has not been&nbsp;spelled out, we may use as support for our assumption what&nbsp;we read in Isaiah 33,20: אהל בל יצען ובל יסע יתדותיו לנצח, “a tent&nbsp;not to be transported whose pegs shall never be pulled up.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Tetzaveh</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,20.ואתה תצוה </span><span class="font5">“and you are to command;” after G’d had completed giving Moses the instructions about all the&nbsp;work pertaining to the Tabernacle, He informed him how to&nbsp;ensure that it would be illuminated inside, [seeing that it did&nbsp;not have any windows. Ed.] This is similar to how He had&nbsp;proceeded when He created the universe. He created the&nbsp;sun and moon only after the earth had already produced&nbsp;vegetation on the third day. (Compare Genesis 1,11-1,14.)&nbsp;The commandment mentioned here became effective only in&nbsp;Numbers 8,1. How are we therefore to understand our verse&nbsp;here? G’d instructed Moses that when the time is ripe, after&nbsp;the Tabernacle has been constructed, the people should&nbsp;supply him with the appropriate kind of oil for lighting the&nbsp;lamps on the candlestick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תצוה את בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “you are to command the Children of Israel;” we note that G’d used a different word for instructing&nbsp;Moses here as the command would not have to be carried&nbsp;out immediately but only some time in the future, seeing that&nbsp;it was still seven months before the Tabernacle would&nbsp;become operational.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקחו אליך</span><span class="font5">, “they will bring to you;” in order that you will be able to see inside the Tabernacle when you enter it and&nbsp;when you wish to leave it. The point G’d is making is that it is&nbsp;not He for Whom the lamps of the candlestick have to be lit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The best proof for this is that the candlestick stood in the Sanctuary, not in the Holy of Holies from which it was&nbsp;separated by a heavy curtain, the latter being in absolute&nbsp;darkness. Not only that, but at the beginning of the chapters&nbsp;dealing with the Tabernacle, G’d had said: “they shall donate&nbsp;a contribution for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Me</span><span class="font5">,” whereas here this contribution was to&nbsp;be for Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שמן זית כתית, </span><span class="font5">“clear oil of beaten olives.” Seeing that in Exodus 25,2, the Torah had described that oil as simply “for&nbsp;illumination,” without specifying details, this had to be stated&nbsp;now that activities inside the Tabernacle which had no&nbsp;windows are discussed. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds that this oil was to be&nbsp;completely free from any residues. According to the author,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> also discusses the collection of individual grains of&nbsp;olives being permissible for profane use as long as they had&nbsp;not ripened. [My sources claim that they have been unable to&nbsp;find such a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> He also claims that the olives on the top of&nbsp;the tree are the first ones to ripen. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,21. אשר על העדות</span><span class="font5">, “which is over the Ark.” The word: על, here cannot be translated as “above, or on,” as we have&nbsp;been told that the candlestick stood on the same floor as the&nbsp;Ark, although it was divided from it by the dividing curtain.&nbsp;This is not the only time that the word על is used as meaning:&nbsp;“beside,” compare Leviticus 24,7, and Exodus 40,3, where&nbsp;there are two more such examples, as well as in Genesis&nbsp;24,30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אהרן ובניו</span><span class="font5">, “Aaron and his sons.” What is meant is: either Aaron or one of his sons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מערב עד בקר</span><span class="font5">, “from evening until morning.” The sages estimated the amount of oil as being half a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">log,</span><span class="font5"> (275 cubic&nbsp;cm). There was no excess, as during the winter months they&nbsp;adjusted this by using coarser wicks. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi</span><span class="font5"> did not feel&nbsp;comfortable with excess oil having to be thrown away, that is&nbsp;why he preferred this solution.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לכהנו לי</span><span class="font5">, “to serve Me as priests;” the letter ו at the&nbsp;end of the word: לכהנו, is superfluous, just as in Psalms 104&nbsp;11, or in Numbers 24,3, or in Numbers 23,18. (Compare Ibn&nbsp;Ezra’s short commentary)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית בגדי קדש</span><span class="font5">, “you are to make holy garments;”&nbsp;after G’d had taught Moses how to construct the Tabernacle,&nbsp;he now proceeds to teach him about the priestly vestments&nbsp;to be worn when the priests perform their duties in the&nbsp;Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,4. ואלה הבגדים</span><span class="font5">, “and these are the vestments “ Our author is stymied by the omission in this list of the “golden&nbsp;headband,” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ציץ, </span><span class="font5">listed in verse 36 of this chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">השן ואפוד</span><span class="font5">, “a breastplate attached to an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.”</span><span class="font5"> At this point, linen trousers are not mentioned, as they were not&nbsp;constructed as a sign of distinction of the individual who wore&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ועשו בגדי קדש, “they (the artisans) shall make holy garments.” Other garments, such as the headband for Aaron&nbsp;and the trousers for his sons, are not mentioned at this&nbsp;stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">28.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והם, “and they,” the artisans,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">יקחו את הזהב, “will take the gold; gold which has been discussed elsewhere, i.e. the donations of gold listed in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat T’rumah.</span><span class="font5"> G’d tells Moses that just as He wishes that&nbsp;Moses should use these donations of gold in the construction&nbsp;of the Tabernacle, so He also wishes that some of it be used&nbsp;for making the priestly vestments. People will not say that&nbsp;Aaron uses this in order to flatter himself, or to enrich&nbsp;himself, as they are aware that it is he who facilitates their&nbsp;obtaining forgiveness for their sins. This will all be spelled out&nbsp;later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">28.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשו את האפוד, “they are to make the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Apparently only a single </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod</span><span class="font5"> was to be made. When we&nbsp;read in Samuel I 23,6: “he brought down an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod</span><span class="font5"> with him,”&nbsp;and in Samuel I 22,18: “he killed eighty five men on that day&nbsp;wearing a linen </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod,”</span><span class="font5"> this is no contradiction to what the&nbsp;Torah wrote, as none of these eighty five men also wore a&nbsp;breastplate attached to their </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.</span><span class="font5"> The Jewish High Priests,&nbsp;when consulting G’d, did so only by means of the breastplate&nbsp;which had the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">urim</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tumim</span><span class="font5"> folded in the pocket at the&nbsp;back of the breastplate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When in Samuel 23,9, David told the High Priest Evyatar to bring forth the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod,</span><span class="font5"> he referred to the one&nbsp;attached to the breastplate that was attached to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The artisans constructed the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod,</span><span class="font5"> according to what is written in the Torah, and as explained by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> There is&nbsp;proof that the ephod was a vestment, as we are told in&nbsp;Samuel II 6,14, that David was girded with an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.</span><span class="font5"> We&nbsp;also have proof that the daughters of the king would wear&nbsp;such a garment so as to be identified of their rank as&nbsp;princesses. (Compare Samuel II 13,18.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">28.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שתי כתפות, “two shoulder pieces (epaulettes) etc;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">וחשב אפודתו, this is an example of the Torah not always</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">describing matters in their chronological order. If it had reported chronologically, the חשב אפודתו, “the decorated band&nbsp;on it” should have been mentioned before prior to the כתפות,&nbsp;shoulder pieces. Similar inverted descriptions are found in&nbsp;the Torah when the word כבשים is spelled as כשבים, or the&nbsp;word שמלה as שלמה. Here too, the word חשב has been spelled&nbsp;inverted as it is from the root חבש, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">to saddle,” as in Genesis&nbsp;22,3, when Avraham sets out on the way to Moriah and the&nbsp;Torah reports that he saddled his donkey early in the&nbsp;morning. What our verse means is that the belts covered the&nbsp;entire upper front surface of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod,</span><span class="font5"> and there was&nbsp;enough length to spare to function as a regular belt around&nbsp;his waist. This is what is meant when we read in Leviticus&nbsp;8,7: ויחגור אותו בחשב האפוד, “girding him with the decorated&nbsp;band with which he tied it to him.” (Moses dressing Aaron).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,8. כמעשהו ממנו יהיה</span><span class="font5">, “it shall be of one piece with it.” This is a reference to the woven patterns of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.</span><span class="font5"> It&nbsp;shall not be woven as a separate piece of cloth. Afterwards it&nbsp;will be attached to the edge of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.</span><span class="font5"> The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod</span><span class="font5"> would&nbsp;have two epaulettes at its two extreme edges and these&nbsp;would be joined, (tied). They would be joined by means of a&nbsp;pin or needle (type of safety pin) so that they would be seen&nbsp;to protrude as if standing, this being the reason why the&nbsp;Torah called them כתפות, “shoulder pieces,” prominent like&nbsp;shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to a different opinion, these epaulettes were very wide, hence they were compared to shoulders.&nbsp;According to that opinion, this is why they were described as&nbsp;חוברות, for if they had been narrow like thin belts, they could&nbsp;not have been properly attached to the breastplate which&nbsp;would have been in danger of falling down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמת את שתי האבנים על כתפות האפוד</span><span class="font5">, “you are to&nbsp;place the two gemstones firmly on the two epaulettes;” this&nbsp;was to be done at the highest point of the High Priest’s&nbsp;shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית משבצות זהב</span><span class="font5">, “you are to make frames for&nbsp;settings of the gemstones, out of gold;” these were&nbsp;indentations; like miniature frames surrounding a picture&nbsp;which is inset. They would form the place to which the&nbsp;braided chains of which the Torah speaks in verse 14 and&nbsp;22, could be fastened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושתי שרשרות</span><span class="font5">, “and two chains etc.;” the chains mentioned here are to be worn by the High Priest lower&nbsp;down; the reason why they are mentioned here is that they&nbsp;were fastened also at the epaulettes, as we know from&nbsp;verses 22-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אדם</span><span class="font5">, a “carnelian;” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פתדה</span><span class="font5">, a “chrysolite;” ברקת, an&nbsp;“emerald;”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.20.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תרשיש</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">a beryl; שהם, a lapis lazuli; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ישפה</span><span class="font5">, “a&nbsp;jasper.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;איש על שמו</span><span class="font5">, each jewel symbolised the name of&nbsp;the tribe in whose row it was placed and engraved..&nbsp;According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the order in which these jewels have&nbsp;been named here corresponded to the order in which the&nbsp;names of the twelve tribes had been arranged on the&nbsp;breastplate, in order of their ages. If </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> were correct, then&nbsp;the jewel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">leshem</span><span class="font5"> should not have been the one symbolising&nbsp;the tribe of Dan, as is clear from Joshua 19,47. We would&nbsp;have to say therefore that the order followed the ages of their&nbsp;respective mothers, i.e. Leah, Bilhah, Zilpah, Rachel. When&nbsp;we accept this then the jewel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">leshem</span><span class="font5"> corresponds to the&nbsp;position of Dan on the breastplate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is an argument between Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish if the respective letters of the&nbsp;name of the tribe stood out, as for instance the letter ע of the&nbsp;name שמעון, and the letter ל in the name לוי, and no letter&nbsp;would move from its place to be joined to its counterpart, so&nbsp;that the whole name would not appear arranged&nbsp;consecutively, or that each name appeared on its jewel&nbsp;completely spelled out consecutively. [We must remember&nbsp;that according to tradition there were a total of 72 letters but&nbsp;seeing that they did not represent each letter in the alphabet,&nbsp;another verse had to be inscribed on the breastplate. [The&nbsp;significance of the number 72 is that it is the number of&nbsp;letters in the longest version of G’d’s name. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית על החשן שרשות</span><span class="font5">, “you shall make chains on&nbsp;the breastplate, etc.;” this is a reference to the two chains&nbsp;that had been mentioned already in verse fourteen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">נשאו נהרות ה', נשאו נהרות קולם</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית על החשן שתי טבעות זהב, ונתת את שתי הטבעות&nbsp;האלה על שני קצות החושן</span><span class="font5">, “you shall attach two rings to the two&nbsp;edges of the breastplate;” to the upper edges of the&nbsp;breastplate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתת את שתי העבותות הזהב</span><span class="font5">, “you shall attach two&nbsp;wreathen chains made of gold;” these are the golden chains&nbsp;of which we said that they were attached to the breastplate&nbsp;as a permanent fixture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת שתי קצות העבותות</span><span class="font5">, “and the other two ends of&nbsp;the wreathen chains, etc.;” this somewhat cumbersome&nbsp;formulation is also found in Exodus 15,16, where we read: עד&nbsp;יעבור עמך ה', עד יעבור עם זו קנית, “until Your people of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">has passed, until this people You have acquired has&nbsp;passed;” a similar construction is also found in Psalms 93,3:&nbsp;נשאו נהרות ה' נשאו נהרות קולם, “the ocean raises its voice o&nbsp;Lord, the oceans sound their thunder.” These are just a few&nbsp;examples of this type of construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The meaning of the verse is as follows: the two ends of the two wreathen chains shall be attached to the two golden&nbsp;frames, משבצות, mentioned in verse 13, between the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">and spread across the breastplate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתת</span><span class="font5">, you are to place these two golden frames at the edge of the epaulettes of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod</span><span class="font5"> which are folded over&nbsp;and hanging down on either side of the High Priest’s neck,&nbsp;slightly protruding forward towards the face of it, i.e. opposite&nbsp;the upper edge which was at his back. It will be partially&nbsp;folded at the front of the High Priests due to the belt and the&nbsp;decorated band which he is tightening with his belt. In the&nbsp;earlier part of this paragraph the construction of these&nbsp;garments was described, whereas here the Torah describes&nbsp;how they were to be worn. [At the end of volume 4, I hope to&nbsp;attach illustrations of all this. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,26. ועשית שתי טבעות זהב</span><span class="font5">, “you will construct two golden rings;” additional ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמת אותם על שתי כתפות מלמטה ממול פניו</span><span class="font5">, ”attach them to the two ends of the breastplate at its edge, at its inner edge&nbsp;which faces the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod”.</span><span class="font5"> In other words: these rings were&nbsp;attached to the inside of the breastplate so as to be in&nbsp;contact with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.</span><span class="font5"> This is the meaning of the word:</span></p>
<p dir="rtl"><span class="font5">.ביתה</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,27. ועשית (עוד) שתי טבעות זהב ונתת אותם על שתי כתפות&nbsp;למטה ממול פניו</span><span class="font5">. “You are to make still another two rings and&nbsp;you shall put them on the two epaulettes of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">underneath on the front part thereof, close to the coupling&nbsp;thereof. This was at the rear of the High Priest’s back, at the&nbsp;lower end of where it was joined to the decorated band of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators claim that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod</span><span class="font5"> covered both the High Priest’s front and his back, similar to a short skirt&nbsp;known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">korshit</span><span class="font5">? They could not imagine that a garment&nbsp;worn beneath one’s loins could be described as “decorative.”&nbsp;We never find such garments except those designed to cover&nbsp;one’s private parts. Furthermore according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;yarns used in these garments consisted of 28 threads each,&nbsp;and no one would have worn such heavy underwear. If the&nbsp;High Priest had had to wear such underwear it would have&nbsp;impeded him in carrying out some parts of his priestly duties.&nbsp;When he bent down they would have fallen off his shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore some commentators believe that they could only have covered the upper part of his torso. They would&nbsp;reach up to shoulder height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שתי כתפות</span><span class="font5">, “two epaulettes;” these have been mentioned first in verse 7. They looked like short belts joined to one&nbsp;another, and they would be attached to both the front and the&nbsp;back of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.</span><span class="font5"> They would rest both over his right&nbsp;shoulder and over his left shoulder. They bore the name&nbsp;“shoulder-pieces,” as they stood upright forming a kind of&nbsp;collar around the High Priest’s neck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחבר</span><span class="font5">, this word from the end of verse 7, means that the shoulder pieces were joined to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod</span><span class="font5"> by means of pins&nbsp;(like safety pins).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">וחשב אפדתו, “and its skillfully woven band;” this was an integral part of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod,</span><span class="font5"> looking like a belt; this is why it&nbsp;was described in Leviticus 8,7: ויחגור אותו בחשב האפד, “he&nbsp;girded him with the girdle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר עליו</span><span class="font5">, “which is upon it;” all around the circumference of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod</span><span class="font5"> this woven band was visible and protruding as if&nbsp;a single belt looking (its woven pattern) like the cloth parts of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.</span><span class="font5"> It looked similar to the workmanship of the robe&nbsp;over which it was worn. In other words: the word עליו, refers&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ממנו יהיה, “</span><span class="font5">it shall be of the same piece.” (verse 8</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font5">Compare my explanation on verse 25</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">until the word: ויורדות,&nbsp;“and hanging down slightly on both sides of his neck, facing&nbsp;the front of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You are to make two additional rings which you will attach to the two lower extremities of the breastplate pointing&nbsp;to the inner part of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod,</span><span class="font5"> underneath in its forepart of,&nbsp;above the skillfully woven band of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod,</span><span class="font5"> so that they&nbsp;were on a level with the lower edge of the breastplate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.28. וירכסו את החשן מטבעותיו</span><span class="font5">, “They shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">with the thread of blue wool so that it will be above the&nbsp;skillfully woven band of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod,</span><span class="font5"> and so that the&nbsp;breastplate will be prevented from moving around on top of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod.” Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has explained this in detail in his&nbsp;commentary of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kedoshim</span><span class="font5"> (Leviticus 19,16.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בחשן המשפט</span><span class="font5">, “on the breastplate of judgment;” the&nbsp;term “judgment” here refers to the High Priest being able to&nbsp;receive answers to queries on Jewish law from G’d when&nbsp;these require to be clarified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונשא אהרן את משפט בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “Aaron will bear the&nbsp;judgment of the Children of Israel on his heart;” i.e. he will&nbsp;inform G’d of the needs of the Jewish people so that he can&nbsp;give them guidance; we have encountered the term משפט in&nbsp;this sense Deuteronomy 18,3, as well as in Kings I 8,59 in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Solomon’s blessing of the people after the consecration of the Temple he had built in Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,32. בתוכו </span><span class="font5">“inside it,” i.e. in its center. Compare to&nbsp;what the Torah wrote in Genesis 2,9, about the tree of life&nbsp;and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מעשה אורג</span><span class="font5">, woven work; the Torah means that it was continuous along the entire neck of the garment. The&nbsp;garment had been woven from the neck down to its hem. At&nbsp;the top it was reinforced so as not to tear easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.34. פעמון זהב ורמון</span><span class="font5">, “with a golden bell and a pomegranate alternating along its lower rim.” The purpose of&nbsp;the pomegranate was to produce sound when the bell hit it&nbsp;while the High Priest was walking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונשמע קולו, </span><span class="font5">“its sound would be audible;” [the&nbsp;High Priest did not wear these garments </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">inside</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;Tabernacle on the Day of Atonement. Ed.] The sound was&nbsp;meant to alert the people that the time for him to perform the&nbsp;service in the Tabernacle had arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to another interpretation, the sound was necessary to warn the other priests not to enter the Holy of&nbsp;Holies. On the Day of Atonement there was no need for it,&nbsp;seeing that only the High Priest performed sacrificial service&nbsp;on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית ציץ, “</span><span class="font5">you are to make a frontlet; (of gold),”&nbsp;a sparkling kind of jewelry. We find that term in such a&nbsp;connection in Ezekiel 1,7: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ונוצצים</span><span class="font5"> כעין נחשת קלל, “they were&nbsp;sparkling like the luster of burnished copper or in Psalms&nbsp;132,18: “and his crown will sparkle on him;”nn ועליו !ציץ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.37. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל מול פני המצנפת יהיה</span><span class="font5">, “upon the forefront of the&nbsp;mitre (liturgical, pointed headdress) on his forehead it shall&nbsp;be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,38. והיה על מצחו תמיד, </span><span class="font5">“it shall be worn on the front of mitre whenever he wears same.” It had the tetragram&nbsp;engraved on the golden band.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.40. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית להם אבנטים ומגבעות</span><span class="font5">, “you will make for them&nbsp;sashes and turbans.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the word מגבעות is&nbsp;an alternate for the word מצנפת, “headgear.” When worn by&nbsp;an ordinary priest it is called מגבעת, whereas the headgear&nbsp;worn by the High Priest is called מצנפת. Actually, the&nbsp;headgear of the ordinary priest was not as high as that of the&nbsp;High Priest, in order to allow for space where he could wear&nbsp;his phylacteries between the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzitz</span><span class="font5"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mitznefet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.41. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וקדשת אותם</span><span class="font5">, “you will sanctify them.” This refers&nbsp;to an oral sanctification. (Ibn Ezra) It is comparable to the&nbsp;oral declaration of someone being declared ritually impure by&nbsp;the priest when with the skin disease </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> in Leviticus&nbsp;13,44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,42-43. מכנסי בד</span><span class="font5">, “linen trousers;” we know that these were trousers, as their purpose is described as covering their&nbsp;private parts, and the Torah does not add the words: לכבוד&nbsp;ולתפארת, “for splendour and for beauty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא ישאו עוון ומתו</span><span class="font5">, “so that they do not incur guilt and die.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this phrase: “from this verse we&nbsp;learn that appearing in the Temple without the appropriate&nbsp;garments is a capital offence.” The Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;83 explains it simply: when a priest wears the priestly&nbsp;garments (in the Temple) he is considered as a priest. When&nbsp;he does not, he is considered as a non-priest who is&nbsp;forbidden to enter the Temple on pain of death. Even&nbsp;omitting his belt, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">avnet,</span><span class="font5"> is considered as being disrobed.&nbsp;There is a dissenting view which limits the death penalty only&nbsp;to priests appearing without trousers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,1. וזה הדבר אשר תעשה להם לקדש אותם</span><span class="font5">, “and this is the thing you are to do for them in order to sanctify them;” after&nbsp;all the construction work on the Tabernacle had been&nbsp;completed as well as the vestments for the priests, the Torah&nbsp;now instructs the priests about their laws of ritual purity, and&nbsp;under what conditions they may partake of the sacrificial&nbsp;sacrifices, where and when these may be consumed, and by&nbsp;whom, in the case of household members of the priests.&nbsp;Rules about ritual baths in order to be ritually pure are also&nbsp;discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תעשה להם</span><span class="font5">, “you shall do for them;” in this instance the plural mode is used as these rules apply to Aaron and his&nbsp;sons. On this day of consecration they were all treated as if&nbsp;of the same rank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,7. ויצקת על ראשו</span><span class="font5">, “you will pour it unto his head; (the&nbsp;oil of anointing);” seeing that he was the High Priest, he was&nbsp;the only one to be anointed. [In verse 19 we will read that&nbsp;when performing sacrificial service the right earlobes and&nbsp;right thumb of Aaron’s sons were also anointed with this oil.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,14. ואת בשר הפר</span><span class="font5">, “and the flesh of the bull;” the Torah&nbsp;mentions the flesh separately seeing that the skin of the&nbsp;entire bull had already been removed before the animal was&nbsp;cut up. Afterwards Aaron took all of it outside the camp as it&nbsp;was a sin offering. This is how our sages in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">interpret the verse in Leviticus 4,12, where the sin offering of&nbsp;the High Priest is discussed, when he has been guilty of sin,&nbsp;of course, not like here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תשרוף באש</span><span class="font5">, “you shall burn in fire;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that this is the only externally offered sin offering that needs to be&nbsp;burned outside. (Instead of the priests consuming part of its&nbsp;meat)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do find that the calf Aaron offered up (Leviticus 9,11) as well as the second bull of the Levites (Ezra 6,17)&nbsp;and the bull of which Ezekiel speaks concerning the future in&nbsp;Ezekiel 45,22 which were all external sin offerings and&nbsp;whose flesh, and entrails were burned or will be burned&nbsp;outside the sacred compounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators try and explain the reason why these sin offerings’ flesh had to be burned </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">outside</span><span class="font5"> the sacred&nbsp;compound as due to the fact that they were Aaron’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">personal&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">offerings, and just as Aaron’s personal </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minchah</span><span class="font5"> offerings&nbsp;must be burned up completely, (Leviticus 6,15) the same&nbsp;applies to his other personal offerings. The purpose of these&nbsp;offerings was to sanctify the altar. Compare verse 36 in our&nbsp;chapter. This procedure could be completed only by means&nbsp;of blood. It appears that at the time of the consecration rites&nbsp;of the Tabernacle and the slaughtering of these animals&nbsp;there was not yet a functioning altar, so that these parts all&nbsp;had to be burned outside the camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.21. ולקחת מן הדם אשר על המזבח</span><span class="font5">, “you will take from the&nbsp;blood which is on the altar;” we do not find another example&nbsp;of this kind of sprinkling blood when the blood had to be&nbsp;gathered up </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> first having been deliberately sprinkled,&nbsp;except during these consecration rites for Aaron and his sons&nbsp;when he and his sons were symbolically being united to the&nbsp;altar through each being sprinkled with some of the blood of&nbsp;each of these sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת שוק הימין, </span><span class="font5">“and the right thigh,” we do not&nbsp;again find an example of burning up the right thigh together&nbsp;with the entrails on any other occasion. The thigh of the ram&nbsp;of the consecration rights being treated in such a manner&nbsp;occurred only on the first day of the seven days of these&nbsp;rites. On the remaining six days not a single thigh was&nbsp;burned up on the altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains when he writes in this connection that the right thigh was intended to be a portion&nbsp;for the officiating priest to eat, (during the other six days of&nbsp;these consecration rights) the offering being understood as a&nbsp;“peace-offering” [the very word שלמים being understood as&nbsp;“perfection, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.] ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי איל מלואים הוא</span><span class="font5">, “for this is a ram of ordination or consecration.” Through its being presented on the altar,&nbsp;these men, Aaron and his sons, became consecrated as&nbsp;priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,24. ושמת הכול על כפי אהרן ועל כפי בניו, </span><span class="font5">“you are to place&nbsp;all of it on the palms of Aaron and the palms of his sons.”&nbsp;You, Moses, will then accept it from them, like a person who&nbsp;accepts a gift and says: “this I offer as a sacrifice before the&nbsp;king,” whereupon the king’s servant (the altar) accepts it on&nbsp;the king’s behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,26. אשר לאהרן</span><span class="font5">, “which was Aaron’s;” at this point Aaron’s sons are not mentioned, as he was the principal&nbsp;figure. The expressions: תנופה and תרומה, are basically the&nbsp;same but the breast is called תנופה, elevation, which had&nbsp;been heaved, and subsequently eaten by Aaron, whereas&nbsp;the thigh was burned up on the altar. In subsequent&nbsp;generations both would be eaten by the priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,33. אשר כופר בהם</span><span class="font5">, “wherewith atonement was made for them;” this verse has at least one word missing, and its&nbsp;meaning is as if the Torah had written: אשר כופר להם בהם, “by&nbsp;means of which the sin of the golden calf had been forgiven&nbsp;them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.36</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על הכפויים</span><span class="font5">, “in addition to the other offerings for&nbsp;atonement;” the two rams that were offered for atonement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.37. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;קדש קדשים</span><span class="font5">, “most holy.” Actually, the correct&nbsp;translation would be: “holy just like the other holy things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל הנוגע במזבח</span><span class="font5">, “whatsoever touches the altar;” anyone wishing to touch the altar must first undergo purification rites.&nbsp;This is also what is written in Exodus 30,20: או בגשתם אל&nbsp;המזבח וגו', “or when they approach the altar, etc.” This is&nbsp;similar to Exodus 19,22: וגם הכהנים הנגשים יתקדשו, “and also&nbsp;the priests who come near have to sanctify themselves;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.38. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזה אשי תעשה</span><span class="font5">, “and this is what you shall do:”&nbsp;Moses will observe seven days of consecration followed by&nbsp;Aaron and his sons observing their own days of&nbsp;consecration. (Ibn Ezra) This is a pattern for all future&nbsp;generations. [I confess not to understand this, as once&nbsp;priests were </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">born</span><span class="font5"> to the priesthood, what purpose would&nbsp;consecration serve, and which ritual do we call consecration&nbsp;of seven days nowadays? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,42. עולת תמיד לדורותיכם</span><span class="font5">, a daily recurring communal burnt offering throughout your generations.” This offering&nbsp;would be instituted daily after the Israelites had crossed the&nbsp;Jordan. Even though this has not been spelled out clearly,&nbsp;reason dictates that it was not an offering presented only in&nbsp;the desert or even only at the bottom of Mount Sinai. If it had&nbsp;been a one time offering, how would we understand the line:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עולת תמיד העשויה בהי סיני, </span><span class="font5">“the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">continual</span><span class="font5"> burnt offering offered&nbsp;at Mount Sinai?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We also have the statement by the prophet Amos in Amos 5,25: הזבחים ומנחה הגשתם לי במדבר ארבעים שנה בית ישראל,&nbsp;“the meat offerings and gift offering that you offered for Me&nbsp;for the forty years in the desert, house of Israel?” Where&nbsp;would the Israelites in the desert have taken the wine, oil,&nbsp;finely ground wheat flour, and all the four legged animals&nbsp;from while they had been in the desert, until the fortieth year&nbsp;completely apart from the people surrounding them? There&nbsp;were so many communal offerings on the Sabbaths, New&nbsp;Moons, festivals, in addition to the daily offerings! If you were&nbsp;to point to Moses telling Pharaoh that the Israelites were&nbsp;going to take all their livestock with them on their going to the&nbsp;desert for three days to offer sacrifices to their G’d&nbsp;(Exodus10,9) or when they complained about their livestock&nbsp;being thirsty, this was in the fortieth year after they had&nbsp;conquered the lands of Sichon and Og, and had captured a&nbsp;huge amount of livestock, which prompted Gad and Reuven&nbsp;to request to settle in hat region permanently. Where would&nbsp;they have taken all these beasts from during the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">preceding&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">38 years? There certainly was no grass in the desert to have&nbsp;fed them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,43 ונקדש בכבודי</span><span class="font5">, “and it will be sanctified by My Presence.” This is what Moses had said to the people in&nbsp;Leviticus 9,6: “and the glory of the Lord will appear to you!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.45. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמת בתוך בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “I shall dwell among the&nbsp;Children of Israel.” The reference is to the time when the&nbsp;flags would be erected, they being equivalent to a dividing&nbsp;fence between the camps of the Levites as such, and the&nbsp;ones performing duties in the compound of the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.46. 'וידעו כי אני' ה</span><span class="font5">, “and they will know that I am the Lord.” They will know that the reason I have taken them out&nbsp;of Egypt was for this, that they construct a residence for Me&nbsp;on earth. This was what G’d had meant when he told Moses&nbsp;at the burning bush (Exodus 3,12) תעבדון את האלוקים על ההר&nbsp;הזה, “you will serve G’d on this Mountain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,1. ועשית מזבח מקטר קטורת</span><span class="font5">, “you will make an altar for burning incense;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Up until now he had only heard about the altar on which burnt offerings, etc. were to be offered up. The reason was&nbsp;that G’d wished to tell Moses that on that altar unauthorized&nbsp;incense must be offered, nor any libations or gift offerings.&nbsp;Moses had alluded to this altar after describing making of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">candlestick (35,14) when prohibiting the offering of “alien” incense on it, and again in 35,14, when the construction of&nbsp;this altar is discussed. It is mentioned again in verse 8 of our&nbsp;chapter after the time for lighting the lamps on the&nbsp;candlestick has been given. This was necessary as the&nbsp;lamps on the candlestick were also permitted to be lit by an&nbsp;ordinary priest. This is clear from 27,21, which refers to both&nbsp;Aaron and his sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,3-4. זר זהב סביב</span><span class="font5">, a golden crown-like rim all around it. This was meant to enclose the thickness of the golden plate&nbsp;on top of the altar in every direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לשאת אותו בהמה, </span><span class="font5">the Levites carrying these furnishings would walk one behind another to carry it on either side of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לפני הפרכת</span><span class="font5">, “in front of the dividing curtain.” In other&nbsp;words, in the middle of the portion called: Sanctuary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והקטיר עליו אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “and Aaron would burn incense on&nbsp;it;” here Aaron, i.e. the High Priest is meant in his capacity as&nbsp;High Priest. Other priests were also allowed to burn incense&nbsp;on the golden altar; [in fact the honour was highly prized, and&nbsp;was distributed by means of a lottery. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;קטרת תמיד</span><span class="font5">, “a regular incense offering, at the time&nbsp;when other offerings were also being presented. This is why&nbsp;the Torah adds the words: לדורותיכם, “throughout your&nbsp;generations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.9. קטרת זרה</span><span class="font5">, “alien incense;” any incense which is not&nbsp;paid for by the congregation as a whole, even if paid for out&nbsp;of the High Priest’s personal funds, was prohibited. This was&nbsp;one of the sins committed by Nadav and Avihu, Aaron’s&nbsp;sons, each of whom had taken his own personal pan and&nbsp;offered incense paid for out of their own pockets. This is (one&nbsp;of the reasons) why they were so harshly punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: “alien incense,” is any incense that does not exactly correspond to the instructions given in&nbsp;the Torah concerning of which spices and how much of each&nbsp;it was to consist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,10. וכפר אהרן על קרנותיו אחת בשנה</span><span class="font5">, “and Aaron is to perform atonement rites once a year on its horns (corners);&nbsp;this does not mean that no blood is to be sprinkled on the&nbsp;horns of this altar except once a year; after all the Torah&nbsp;wrote (Leviticus 4,7) that if the High priest has committed an&nbsp;inadvertent sin that he must atone for this by means of the&nbsp;blood of a bull, by sprinkling some of it on the horns of this&nbsp;altar, and the same procedure is also decreed to be&nbsp;performed in another instance mentioned in Leviticus 4,18,;&nbsp;but in our verse the Torah refers to the Day of Atonement&nbsp;when the High Priest performs all the rites pertaining to&nbsp;atonement for the entire nation, after having first made sure&nbsp;that his own sins and those of his family had been atoned for.&nbsp;This ritual had to be performed every year on the same day,&nbsp;whereas the other two rituals we cited may not have been&nbsp;called for many years.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Ki Tissa</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,12. כי תשא</span><span class="font5">, “when you count,” in the second year;&nbsp;this has been spelled out in Numbers 1,1, i.e. בשנה השנית; it&nbsp;says there: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">שאו</span><span class="font5"> את ראש כל עדת בני ישראל, “count the sum total&nbsp;of the entire community of the Children of Israel; The&nbsp;expression of כי תשא, i.e. “when you count,” clearly refers to a&nbsp;point in the future. On the other hand, the command </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">שאו,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">clearly is a command to be carried out forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This portion was told to Moses on the first day of the month of Adar, i.e. the last month of the first year of the&nbsp;Exodus, in order to inform the people that the money,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(shekalim)</span><span class="font5"> for the communal offerings in the Tabernacle had&nbsp;become due at that time. The service in the Tabernacle&nbsp;began on the first day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5"> of the second year, i.e. a&nbsp;month after this command had been issued. It is clear that&nbsp;the work of building the Tabernacle must have been&nbsp;completed already by that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתנו איש כופר נפשו</span><span class="font5">, “they are each to give his personal ransom for his soul;” the communal offerings were meant as&nbsp;atonement for the people, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has explained on verse&nbsp;15. The words ונתת אותו על עבודת אהל מועד, “you shall assign it&nbsp;(the proceeds) for the service in the Tent of Meeting,” is clear&nbsp;evidence of what these </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shekalim</span><span class="font5"> were to be used for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יהיה בהם נגף בפקוד אותם</span><span class="font5">, “so that there will not occur a plague among them due to the manner in which they are&nbsp;being counted in the second year.” They had already paid&nbsp;the ransom for their souls. This assurance has been given&nbsp;here, seeing that when David took a census of the Jewish&nbsp;people a plague broke out and 70000 of them died as a&nbsp;result of that plague as punishment for an unauthorized&nbsp;census. (Compare Samuel II 1-16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, our sages </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Baba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> folio 42), state that blessings never accompany matters which are subject to&nbsp;counting, measuring or weighing. In light of this, the Torah&nbsp;here assures us that this census will not have any negative&nbsp;fallout, seeing that the atonement which accompanies this&nbsp;census neutralises any negative fallout accompanied with&nbsp;taking a census. You will not become victimized before your&nbsp;enemies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בפקוד אותם </span><span class="font5">“when you count them prior to going into battle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.13. כל העובר על הפקודים</span><span class="font5">, “everyone that passes as recorded in the census, etc.;” at the time when the census&nbsp;took place, the individuals being counted had to pass through&nbsp;a door leading outside. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Bechor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מחצית השקל</span><span class="font5">, the “half” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shekel</span><span class="font5"> symbolised the fact that the dancing around the golden calf had occurred at midday.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Daat Zekeynim)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מבן עשרים שנה ומעלה</span><span class="font5">, “from twenty years and up;”&nbsp;anyone under that ages is not subject to punishment at the&nbsp;hands of heaven, though on earth he is punishable from the&nbsp;age of 13, or 12 in the case of girls. Therefore the people&nbsp;younger than twenty did not need to obtain their forgiveness&nbsp;by means of this ransom payment. The total amount raised&nbsp;by this census amounted to one talent of silver. How do we&nbsp;arrive at that amount? Most people do not live for more than&nbsp;seventy years. The first twenty years they do not need&nbsp;atonement as their sins have not been registered in the&nbsp;celestial ledger. This leaves 50 years during which they may&nbsp;need atonement by means of the holy half shekel which is&nbsp;equivalent to a secular shekel. When you multiply this by&nbsp;600000, the number of able bodied soldiers amongst the&nbsp;Israelites you get 300000 holy shekels per year, or 100&nbsp;talents of silver per year. (1 talent is equal to 3000 holy&nbsp;shekels. Seeing that the wicked Haman was familiar with&nbsp;this, he offered the king ten thousand talents of silver to&nbsp;compensate for the king’s loss of taxes from the Jews.&nbsp;600000 Jews giving </span><span class="font7"><sup>1</sup>/2</span><span class="font5"> holy shekels for 50 years would&nbsp;amount to 100000 talents of silver.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;העשיר לא ירבה</span><span class="font5">, “a wealthy person must not&nbsp;contribute in excess of this,” for if the Torah were to allow the&nbsp;wealthy to contribute more and the poor to contribute less&nbsp;than a half holy shekel each, how could each of them attain&nbsp;the same level of atonement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכפר על נפשותיכם, </span><span class="font5">“to obtain atonement for yours sins.” The sin being that they had made it necessary for G’d to take&nbsp;a census of them as a result of the in of the golden calf, [and&nbsp;in order to count the victims as absentees. Ed.] Moreover,&nbsp;how would we know the total number of shekels that had&nbsp;been raised by these contributions, and how could we have&nbsp;been sure there were enough to construct the sockets of the&nbsp;Tabernacle from them? From the wording of the Torah it is&nbsp;clear that atonement was achieved </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the actual census.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,16. את כסף הכפירים</span><span class="font5">, “the money for the atonement;” it is now called “money of atonement,” as the Torah had&nbsp;introduced it as becoming such in verses 12 and 15. The&nbsp;reason why the paragraph of the census appears here is&nbsp;because the Torah had spoken of the once a year atonement&nbsp;in connection with Aaron’s offering blood for atonement </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">once&nbsp;a year </span><span class="font5">on the horns of the golden altar. (30,10) This money&nbsp;for atonement is only collected once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah now continues with the instructions for the laver and its supporting stand, from which the priests and&nbsp;Levites will have to wash their hands and feet as required on&nbsp;different occasions, as well as the paragraphs about the&nbsp;ingredients making up the oil for anointing and the spices for&nbsp;the daily incense offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief architect supervising a team of skilled people was Betzalel, and his second in command, Oholiov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah repeats that the work prohibitions of the Sabbath override the need to complete the Tabernacle as&nbsp;soon as possible. This is followed by Moses’ prayer on behalf&nbsp;of the people when informed by G’d that they had become&nbsp;guilty of idolatry during his absence. The Torah had to briefly&nbsp;relate to us what had occurred during Moses stay on the&nbsp;Mountain, else how did Moses know what to pray for and&nbsp;why? Moses experienced glory when G’d spoke to him “face&nbsp;to face,” although this is not to be understood literally, of&nbsp;course, seeing that G’d went out of His way to explain to him&nbsp;that mortal beings cannot experience a visual revelation. He&nbsp;was given an opportunity to supply G’d with a second set of&nbsp;Tablets upon which to engrave the Ten Commandments&nbsp;which G’d had engraved on the first set of Tablets which&nbsp;consisted of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">celestial</span><span class="font5"> raw material. Moses’ return to the&nbsp;people was crowned by the fact that his face radiated so&nbsp;much holiness that he had to cover his forehead with a cloth&nbsp;so as not to frighten the people away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לבני ישראל לזכרון</span><span class="font5">, “as a reminder for the Children of Israel.” Seeing that every Israelite has contributed to the&nbsp;making of the Tabernacle, it follows that every time I&nbsp;remember the Tabernacle, I will remember him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכפר על נפשותיכם</span><span class="font5">, “to atone for your souls.” Some commentators claim that as long as the silver from this&nbsp;contribution remained in existence, there was no need to&nbsp;make another such contribution when a census would be&nbsp;taken. This is why no mention is made of a further&nbsp;contribution when the Israelites were counted once more in&nbsp;the 40<sup>th</sup> year after the debacle at Shittim, and Pinchas’&nbsp;slaying the prince of Shimon, Zimri. (Numbers 25,13) By the&nbsp;time another census was taken some 400 years later in the&nbsp;time of David, this silver even if it still existed, could not be&nbsp;identified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית כיור</span><span class="font5">, “you are to make a laver;” the reason&nbsp;why this vessel has not been mentioned earlier when the&nbsp;furnishings of the Tabernacle have been listed, is that the&nbsp;function of the laver was only as something preparatory for&nbsp;the performance of a commandment, not a commandment&nbsp;itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The copper laver and its stand were not equipped with staves by means of which to carry them, but they were&nbsp;transported on the wagons as were the planks of the&nbsp;Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בין אהל מועד ובין המזבח</span><span class="font5">, “between the Tent of Meeting and between the altar, outside the Sanctuary, so that the priests&nbsp;could enter after having purified themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ורחצו ממנו</span><span class="font5">, they are to wash themselves from its&nbsp;waters, outside, not within the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ירחצו מים</span><span class="font5">, “they shall wash with water;” this has&nbsp;been repeated as they had to wash themselves both before&nbsp;going in or even when approaching the golden altar to offer&nbsp;incense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ורחצו ידיהם</span><span class="font5">, ‘they are to wash their hands;” this&nbsp;has also been repeated to stress that this was a law for all&nbsp;future generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,23. בשמים ראש</span><span class="font5">, “choice spices;” the expression ראש,&nbsp;usually translated as “head,” is linguistically related to חשבון,&nbsp;an account, itself related to חשוב, important, significant. It has&nbsp;been used at the beginning of our portion i.e. כי תשא את </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ראש</span><span class="font5">&nbsp;בני ישראל, “when you count, i.e. elevate the sum total of the&nbsp;Children of Israel.” Each person counted individually, attains&nbsp;a higher social rank merely by his name being recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that previously the Torah had only summarised the oil for anointing in chapters 28 and 29 without informing&nbsp;us of the ingredients making up this oil, it now gives us the&nbsp;relevant details including the quantities to be used of each in&nbsp;the mixture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בשמים</span><span class="font5">, “spices,” these are fragrances growing on trees, or roots, as we know from Song of Songs 4,16: הפיחי גני יזלו&nbsp;בשמיו, “that its perfume may spread throughout my garden.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">סמים</span><span class="font5">, by contrast, are a kind of resin, as opposed to roots, which drip from the trunks of the trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,25. מעשה </span><span class="font5">רקח, “compounded by a perfumer;” a&nbsp;concoction recognisable immediately as being the work of an&nbsp;expert in his field, something impossible to have been&nbsp;manufactured by a layman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,29. וקדשת אותם</span><span class="font5">, “you shall sanctify them;” by means&nbsp;of anointing them with these fragrances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיו קדש קדשים</span><span class="font5">, “so that they will be most holy.” They will be just as holy as the furnishings </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">inside</span><span class="font5"> the Sanctuary.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל הנוגע בהם יקדש</span><span class="font5">, “any unauthorized person or object coming into direct contact with them will become ‘holy,’ (in&nbsp;the sense of out of bounds, no longer may be used for&nbsp;secular purposes.)”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If such a person wished to touch these vessels, provided he was basically permitted to be in the compound&nbsp;where they stood, he would first have to sanctify himself by&nbsp;washing himself with the waters from the laver. We have a&nbsp;similar expression in Exodus 19,22:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'הכהנים הנגשים אל ה</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">יתקדשו, “the priests who wished to come closer to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem </span><span class="font5">shall first sanctify themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,31. יהיה זה לי</span><span class="font5">, “this shall be for Me;” this is why I have said: ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“he shall sanctify himself before coming into direct contact with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,32. *לא ייסן</span><span class="font5">, “it shall not be poured;” an unusual&nbsp;formulation, meaning the same as if it had been spelled לא&nbsp;יוסך. We encounter a similar pattern in Genesis 50,26 in&nbsp;connection with Joseph’s temporary burial in Egypt, where&nbsp;the Torah reports that his remains were preserved in a&nbsp;casket, by writing: ויישם בארון במצרים, “he was placed in a&nbsp;casket in Egypt,” instead of writing: ויושם.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;קח לך סמים</span><span class="font5">, “take for yourself a variety of resins;”&nbsp;(alternate translation: sweet incense, presumably because&nbsp;how can one beat sticky resin?)” the latter varieties were not&nbsp;included in this list. [There are contradictory opinions&nbsp;regarding the list given here and that in verses 22-25, and&nbsp;their uses. Seeing we have no eye-witnesses of what was&nbsp;used when, I will not detail them except to point out that the&nbsp;group in verses 22-25 were described as בשמים, and the&nbsp;group mentioned here were all summed up under the&nbsp;heading סמים. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בד בבד</span><span class="font5">, “each kind was to be of equal weight to its counterpart.” It would undergo individual treatment by the&nbsp;perfumer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ממולח</span><span class="font5">, “seasoned with salt;” compare Ezekiel&nbsp;16,4: והמלח לא הומלחת, “and you had not been rubbed with&nbsp;salt.” Compare also Ezra 4,14: די מלח היכלא מלחנא, “seeing&nbsp;that we have eaten from the salt of the palace, etc.” [i.e. the&nbsp;king has fed us generously. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושחקת ממנו הדק</span><span class="font5">, “you shall beat some of it into&nbsp;powder;” this was necessary in order to fulfill what is written&nbsp;about the incense offering on the Day of Atonement in&nbsp;Leviticus 16,12: קטורת סמים דקה, “incense consisting of sweet&nbsp;incense beaten small;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.2. בצלאל בו אורי בן חור</span><span class="font5">, “Betzalel, son of Uri, son of Chur;” Betzalel’s ancestry is given for 3 generations,&nbsp;whereas that of his assistant Oholiov is only traced to his&nbsp;father. The reason is that Betzalel’s grandfather had become&nbsp;a martyr during the episode of the golden calf, when he tried&nbsp;to prevent the people from dancing around the golden calf.&nbsp;Seeing that the building of the Tabernacle was primarily in&nbsp;order to facilitate atonement for the sin of the golden calf, it is&nbsp;appropriate that the Torah mentions Chur’s name in this&nbsp;connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,8. ואת המנורה הטהורה</span><span class="font5">, “and the candlestick, the pure one;” none of the other furnishings of the Tabernacle have&nbsp;had the adjective; “the pure one” added to it, except the&nbsp;candlestick and the table in Leviticus 24,6. The reason is that&nbsp;neither the table nor the candlestick ever had blood sprinkled&nbsp;on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת בגדי השרד</span><span class="font5">, “and the service vestments.” The&nbsp;word שרד is reminiscent of פליט ושריד in Jeremiah 44,14,&nbsp;where it refers to remnants of escapees after the destruction&nbsp;of the Temple. Here too, the expression is referring to excess&nbsp;materials used for weaving of the carpets forming the inner&nbsp;ceiling of the Tabernacle, and the priestly garments, as well&nbsp;as the curtain at the entrance of the Tabernacle and the&nbsp;dividing curtain between the Sanctuary and the Holy of&nbsp;Holies. From these remnants the covers for the furnishings of&nbsp;the Tabernacle while it was in transit were constructed.&nbsp;These covers were alluded to by the same expression in&nbsp;Exodus 39,41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת קטורת הסמים לקדש</span><span class="font5">, “and the incense of sweet&nbsp;spices for the holy place;” i.e. for use in the holy places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,13. אך את שבתותי תשמורו </span><span class="font5">, “but you must observe My Sabbath days;” the reason why the Torah repeats this&nbsp;instruction was to tell us that this applies not only during the&nbsp;period when the Tabernacle was being constructed, but for&nbsp;all future generations. This is the origin of which type of work&nbsp;is forbidden to be performed on the Sabbath. Any type of&nbsp;work which was performed during the construction of the&nbsp;Tabernacle, i.e. was required to be performed in the&nbsp;construction of the Tabernacle or service in the Tabernacle,&nbsp;was henceforth forbidden to be performed on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אות היא ביני וביניכם</span><span class="font5">, “for it is a sign between you and Me for generations.” By the use of the word: וביניכם, the&nbsp;Torah emphasizes that it is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> between G’d and the Jewish&nbsp;people that such a relationship exists. It is only the Jews who&nbsp;use the Sabbath to rest on it as G’d rested on it after having&nbsp;completed creating the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמרתם את השבת</span><span class="font5">, “you must observe the&nbsp;Sabbath;” the reason that this has been repeated is to warn&nbsp;that anyone desecrating the Sabbath purposely and publicly,&nbsp;will be executed. If he does so secretly, he will be cut off from&nbsp;membership in the Jewish people and its eternal future by an&nbsp;act of G’d. Seeing that the penalty has already been spelled&nbsp;out, the warning not to become guilty of this sin and its&nbsp;penalty has to be spelled out also; hence the Torah writes&nbsp;not only: מחלליה מות יומת, but also: כל העושה בו מלאכה מות יומת,&nbsp;“anyone performing forbidden activities on it will be&nbsp;executed.” It does not matter whether such forbidden activity&nbsp;is carried out by day or by night. This is made clear by the&nbsp;repetition of ויום השביעי קודש, “the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">entire</span><span class="font5"> seventh day is holy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ששת ימים יעשה מלאכה</span><span class="font5">, “during six days work may&nbsp;be performed.” This verse refers to work being performed if&nbsp;you so desire; another verse says ששת ימים תעבוד</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">during six&nbsp;days you are to perform the kind of work which is normally&nbsp;felt as something burdensome.” (Exodus 35,2) The reason&nbsp;why the Torah writes both formulations is to tell us that when&nbsp;we observe the Torah, others may perform this kind of labour&nbsp;on our behalf; if we do not observe the Torah, instead of&nbsp;benefiting by an extra day of work, we will experience all&nbsp;seven days as days when we have to perform demeaning&nbsp;work. The repetition of the instruction was necessary on&nbsp;account of the penalty of מות ימות, “he will be executed,”&nbsp;having been written twice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמרו בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “The Children of Israel shall&nbsp;observe, etc,;” they shall have in mind the next Sabbath&nbsp;during the six working days, looking forward to it, and to&nbsp;prepare for it in order not to need to desecrate it when it&nbsp;comes. This expression has also been repeated on account&nbsp;of it having to match the expression ברית עולם, “an everlasting&nbsp;covenant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,18. ככלותו לדבר אתו</span><span class="font5">, “when He had concluded speaking with him;” at the end of the sixteenth day in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tammuz,</span><span class="font5"> (just before dawn on the seventeenth)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לוחות אבן, </span><span class="font5">“Tablets of stone.” This word is used as meaning that the raw material that these Tablets were made&nbsp;of was indestructible, i.e. not subject to disintegration by&nbsp;natural wear and tear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the word was used as a hint that most capital offences when committed deliberately are&nbsp;subject to the penalty of death by stoning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Seeing that the Tablets had been made in the celestial regions, the word “stone” had to be used as we are not&nbsp;familiar with the raw material used, and since Moses&nbsp;smashed them, no one even ever saw the Tablets. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,1. ויקהל העם</span><span class="font5">, “the people assembled;” whenever the expression ויקהל appears and is followed by the word: על, it&nbsp;means: “against,” i.e. it is the Torah’s way of condemning&nbsp;such an assembly. On the other hand, if the word following&nbsp;the word ויקהל, either in the singular or the plural mode is&nbsp;followed by the word אל, this signifies a positive&nbsp;development. Compare Kings I 8,2 where the people&nbsp;assembled around King Solomon to watch the Holy Ark&nbsp;being transported to the newly erected Temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמרו אליו קום עשה לנו אלוהים</span><span class="font5">, “they said to him (Aaron) arise and make a visual image of G’d!” According to the plain&nbsp;meaning of the text there can be no question that Aaron had&nbsp;no intention to allow the people to revert to idolatry, G’d&nbsp;forbid, or somehow to replace </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> or His prophet.&nbsp;Moses, while on earth, had frequently been referred to as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim,</span><span class="font5"> either when compared to the creature issuing&nbsp;commands in the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> to Pharaoh, or as&nbsp;communicating G’d’s law to the people. If Aaron had&nbsp;intended to become the replacement of his brother Moses,&nbsp;Moses would have had to execute him as a false prophet!&nbsp;Not only that, but how could that “false” prophet&nbsp;subsequently have been appointed as the foremost&nbsp;instrument of securing Israel’s atonement?! Moreover, how&nbsp;could he have become the first priest and all his male&nbsp;offspring became the priests of the whole people? Not only&nbsp;that; we do not even find that at מי מריבה, the waters of strife,&nbsp;where Moses is punished for having struck the rock and&nbsp;denied entry to the Holy Land as a result, that the Torah had&nbsp;a single word of criticism of Aaron, although he too did not&nbsp;enter the Holy Land? There is not a single sage that ever&nbsp;suggested that G’d would appoint as a prophet someone&nbsp;who would eventually revert to idolatry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There can therefore be no question that what the people demanded of Aaron was not a return to idolatry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The problem had been that Moses had not announced by what date he would return from the Mountain. The reason&nbsp;that he did not do so was simply that he himself had not&nbsp;known when he would return. G’d had told him that He would&nbsp;give him the Tablets, but had not said when.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the people noticed that Moses took an inordinately long time, far longer than a normal person can&nbsp;go without food or drink, they worried that he might have&nbsp;died, in fact they were convinced that he had. They therefore&nbsp;requested from Aaron that he make for them a replacement&nbsp;whose function would be similar to what had been Moses’&nbsp;function </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> Pharaoh, i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah even spelled out what the assembled people had in mind, i.e. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי זה משה האיש אשר העלנו מארץ מצרים לא ידענו&nbsp;מה היה לו</span><span class="font5">, “for this man Moses, who took us out of Egypt, we&nbsp;do not know what has happened to him.” In other words: they&nbsp;wanted to replace the Moses the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">man</span><span class="font5">, not the deity, or semideity. When David in Psalms 106,20 is quoted as having&nbsp;referred to that episode with the words: וימירו את כבודם בתבנית&nbsp;שור אוכל עשב, “they traded their glory for the image of a bull&nbsp;that feeds on grass,” the people had referred to Moses, not&nbsp;to G’d. G’d had performed so many miracles which had been&nbsp;orchestrated by Moses, that they had been quite prepared to&nbsp;prostrate themselves before such a leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the people asked for a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">creature </span><span class="font5">that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> would use to imbue with His glory,&nbsp;[similar to how He spoke from between the cherubs on the lid&nbsp;of the Holy Ark, the cherubs and their faces of innocent&nbsp;children not being so much different from the golden calf, the&nbsp;principal difference being that no one ever got to see them.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר ילכו לפנינו</span><span class="font5">, “who shall go before us;” in using the plural mode they mistakenly made Aaron a partner of G’d,&nbsp;assuming that he was as experienced in performing miracles&nbsp;as had been Moses, and remembering that Aaron had&nbsp;actually orchestrated a number of the miracles involving the&nbsp;ten plagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי זה משה האיש</span><span class="font5">, “for Moses, this man, etc.;” from the manner in which they referred to Moses with the pronoun&nbsp;“this,” although “HE” was not present, we can form an idea of&nbsp;the urgency haste and confused thinking that dominated the&nbsp;people’s mind at that time. We find the word זה used in&nbsp;inappropriate situations on numerous occasions, such as in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kohelet,</span><span class="font5"> 7,27, where the author refers to something&nbsp;intangible when he says: ראה זה מצאתי, “see </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font5"> is what I&nbsp;found, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32, 2. פרקו נזמי זהב</span><span class="font5">, “take off the golden rings, etc.” it is clear from the fact that Aaron asked the men to take the&nbsp;jewelry of their </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">wives</span><span class="font5">, that his intentions were perfectly pure.&nbsp;He thought that if he were to suggest anyone of the leaders&nbsp;of the people to take the place of Moses, such a person&nbsp;would not be willing to give up his promotion on the following&nbsp;day when Moses would return and this would result in&nbsp;dissension and possible civil war amongst the people. On the&nbsp;other hand, if he were not to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">appear</span><span class="font5"> to comply with the&nbsp;people’s wishes by doing nothing, they would choose&nbsp;someone, which would lead to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">immediate</span><span class="font5"> dissension among&nbsp;the people. If he were to suggest that he himself would take&nbsp;over Moses’ position, Moses would find this difficult to accept&nbsp;on his return. He therefore decided to play for time, so that&nbsp;no action would be taken pending Moses’ return on the next&nbsp;day, which is what he expected. The problem would&nbsp;therefore resolve itself without any revolutionary changes&nbsp;having been taken. By suggesting that these people bring&nbsp;him the jewelry of their wives, he thought he would gain&nbsp;enough time, as suggested by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi. (Rashi</span><span class="font5"> suggested that&nbsp;he was sure the women would not be willing to part with their&nbsp;jewelry for such a purpose as making an inanimate object a&nbsp;replacement for Moses.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,4. ויצר אותו</span><span class="font5">, “he shaped it,” the expression יצר, used by the Torah here to describe what Aaron did with the golden&nbsp;jewelry he had received, is based on the word: צרר, “to make&nbsp;a bundle of something, to treat it indiscriminately, or to&nbsp;compress it.” The author uses Proverbs 7,20 and Kings II&nbsp;5,23 as parallels and bases himself on the commentary of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויעשהו</span><span class="font5">, “he made it into the shape of a calf.” He did not select a different creature, seeing that the mixed multitude&nbsp;that had joined the Jewish bandwagon at the Exodus had&nbsp;been the first to gang up on him, demanding a replacement&nbsp;for Moses. They had heard Moses sing after the splitting of&nbsp;the sea: זה א-לי ואנוהו, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font5"> is My G’d and I will enshrine Him!”&nbsp;They had only seen the feet of the angels surrounding G’d’s&nbsp;throne, feet which looked like the feet of a calf. They had&nbsp;mistakenly assumed that what they had seen were the&nbsp;footprints of G’d which had the appearance of calves’ feet.&nbsp;This is also why the psalmist in Psalms 77,20 writes: “Your&nbsp;way was through the sea, Your path through the mighty&nbsp;waters; Your tracks could be seen.” They had mistaken the&nbsp;footprints of the angels for the footprints of G’d Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמרו אלה אלוהיך ישראל</span><span class="font5">, they said: “these are your gods o Israel;” is it conceivable that these fellow travelers were so&nbsp;foolish as to credit a newly cast golden calf as having&nbsp;orchestrated the Exodus which had occurred 3 months&nbsp;before that calf had been cast in gold? The sorcerers among&nbsp;the mixed multitude were able to create the illusion that some&nbsp;deity is speaking from their mouth. They now created the&nbsp;illusion that this calf had addressed them from its mouth, and&nbsp;that it was far superior to any Egyptian deity as it was made&nbsp;of pure gold, so that what came forth from such a mouth&nbsp;must be sacred. The fact that they did not say: “these are our&nbsp;gods who have taken us out of Egypt, is evidence that the&nbsp;Israelites had never become guilty of worshipping the calf&nbsp;with words such as these. Nonetheless, the whole people at&nbsp;this point were being tested by G’d as to their sincere belief&nbsp;in a G’d Who is and remains unseen and devoid of tangible&nbsp;dimensions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Book of Deuteronomy, 40 years later, Moses still warns the people of such tests by G’d when he refers to&nbsp;prophets who try to legitimize themselves by working&nbsp;miracles and predicting matters which will come true though&nbsp;no one else had even dreamt of such things. (Deut. 13,2-6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירא אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “Aaron saw;” Aaron now realised the&nbsp;error the people had made and became afraid that as soon&nbsp;as they would realise that this golden calf could never be of&nbsp;any help to them, so that they would insist on appointing one&nbsp;of their midst as Moses’ successor; this spelled potential&nbsp;disaster. Therefore he proceeded to build an altar, ostensibly&nbsp;before that calf, in order to make the people believe that he&nbsp;was taking steps to worship the golden calf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חג לה' מחר</span><span class="font5">, “there will be a feast for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> tomorrow!” He meant that on the following day they would celebrate the&nbsp;new leader that G’d had given them. In the meantime, he&nbsp;stalled the people with words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישכימו ממחרת</span><span class="font5">, “They arose prematurely early on&nbsp;the following day;” the date was the seventeenth of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tammuz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויעלו עולות</span><span class="font5">, “they offered burnt offerings.” These burnt offerings were offered quite innocently in honour of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">[We find something similar in Samuel I 11,15, on the&nbsp;occasion of the first Jewish King, King Sha-ul being crowned&nbsp;at Gilgal, though at that time the offerings were meat&nbsp;offerings most of which could be eaten by the people present&nbsp;at the celebration. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר העלית</span><span class="font5">, “whom you (Moses, not G’d) have&nbsp;brought out of Egypt.” The vowel pattern of this word is&nbsp;slightly different from the vowel pattern of the same word in&nbsp;33,1, so that the reading is slightly different too. The author&nbsp;does not offer a reason for the difference;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[perhaps he means to suggest that the העם referred to in 33,1 are the true Israelites for whom the Exodus was a moral&nbsp;ethical elevation, whereas the העם that Moses had taken out&nbsp;of Egypt </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> consulting G’d had become a spiritual&nbsp;burden, instead. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;סרו מהר</span><span class="font5">, “they deviated quickly, etc.” they already&nbsp;elected a new leader for themselves instead of you whom I&nbsp;had appointed to be their leader. Not only that, but they also&nbsp;made a molten calf for themselves, contravening My&nbsp;command not to make themselves any cast images. My&nbsp;commandment included the prohibition to make such a cast&nbsp;image even if it was intended to symbolize Me. Although they&nbsp;had no idolatrous intention with what they did, they&nbsp;contravened My commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הניחה לי</span><span class="font5">, “Let Me be;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> used this mild form&nbsp;of rebuke, out of respect for Moses. He meant that the fact&nbsp;that the people had chosen an unfit replacement instead of&nbsp;Moses, this alone was enough to punish them severely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויחל משה</span><span class="font5">, “Moses began to pacify;” according to&nbsp;some commentators the prayer alluded to here is the one&nbsp;spelled out in greater in Deuteronomy 9,25, where Moses&nbsp;adds that he threw himself on the ground in prayer for forty&nbsp;days, etc.; this actually happened after he had already&nbsp;descended from the Mountain, smashed the Tablets, made&nbsp;gold dust out of the golden calf, had the Levites execute the&nbsp;ones who actively worshipped the calf and danced around it,&nbsp;and had purified the people by making them drink water&nbsp;containing ash of the golden calf. These commentators&nbsp;consider it unbelievable that Moses had the nerve to ask for&nbsp;forgiveness of the people </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the latter had done their part&nbsp;in making penance for their grievous error. Those were the&nbsp;forty days during which G’d had told Moses that He would&nbsp;not be the One leading them up to the Promised Land.&nbsp;(verses 31-33). When hearing this, Moses had responded&nbsp;with reminding G’d of His promise, commencing with&nbsp;Deuteronomy 33,12. According to our author, Moses did </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">ascend the Mountain during these 40 days, for how could he&nbsp;have done so without first having obtained permission to do&nbsp;so? At the end of those intermediate 40 days, when G’d had&nbsp;indicated that he had reconciled Himself to the people, He&nbsp;said to him: “carve yourself a second set of Tablets, etc.” and&nbsp;had asked him to ascend the Mountain again. (Exodus 34,1)&nbsp;When Moses ascended again (34,4) he remained on the&nbsp;Mountain and did not descend until the tenth day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למה ה׳ יחרה אפך בעמך, </span><span class="font5">“What for, o Lord, are You becoming angry, etc.?” Moses’ reasoning was that it did not&nbsp;seem reasonable after all the time and effort G’d had&nbsp;invested in bringing this people to the spiritual level they had&nbsp;achieved at the time of the revelation, that all this should be&nbsp;wiped out in one moment, as if it were completely&nbsp;irretrievable? He added, that the Egyptians would have the&nbsp;last laugh after all, when they would hear of the annihilation&nbsp;of G’d’s people. He also asked what would become of G’d’s&nbsp;oath to the patriarchs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.15. 'ויפן וירד משה וגו</span><span class="font5">, “Moses turned around and descended, etc.;” all this occurred in order, on the 17th day&nbsp;of Tammuz up until verse 29: לתת עליכם היום ברכה, “to bestow&nbsp;a blessing upon you this day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושני לוחות העדות בידו</span><span class="font5">, “with the two Tablets of testimony in his hand.” Even though Moses already planned to smash&nbsp;these Tablets, he carried them all the way down from the&nbsp;Mountain so that G’d should not have to look at His&nbsp;handiwork having been smashed by Moses seeing that its&nbsp;inscription commenced with: “I am the Lord your G’d Who&nbsp;has taken you out of Egypt, followed by the commandment&nbsp;not to have alien deities, etc.” This would have been too&nbsp;upsetting a reminder of the people’s disloyalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">משני עבריהם</span><span class="font5">, “the letters were hollowed out from one side to the other, thus making the Tablets easier to smash.” (This&nbsp;is why this detail is added at this particular point.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והלוחות מעשה אלוקים המה</span><span class="font5">, “the raw material that the&nbsp;Tablets consisted of was of Divine manufacture.” This is&nbsp;pointed out here in order to impress the reader of the&nbsp;magnitude of losing such a gift made by G’d’s own hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,19. </span><span class="font5">ומחולות </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“and the dancing;” we know this word as meaning: “dancing,” from Psalms 150,4: הללוהו בתוף ומחול,&nbsp;“praise Him with the drum and dance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישלך מידיו</span><span class="font5">, “he hurled from his hands;” Moses’ physical strength left him when he saw with his own eyes the golden&nbsp;calf, and he was no longer able to hold on to the Tablets, and&nbsp;threw them a short distance from where he stood, just far&nbsp;enough so that they would not hurt his feet by falling on&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישבר אותם תחת ההר</span><span class="font5">, “he shattered them at the foot of the Mountain.” He did so because the letter ט of the Hebrew&nbsp;alphabet did not appear on them even once. The reward for&nbsp;honouring father and mother, i.e. למען יי</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ט</span><span class="font5">ב לך, “in order that&nbsp;you may fare well,” appears only on the second set of&nbsp;Tablets (Deuteronomy 5,16). By smashing the first set of&nbsp;Tablets Moses accomplished that the reward for keeping the&nbsp;commandment of honouring one’s parent was engraved on&nbsp;the second set of the Tablets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,20. וישרוף באש</span><span class="font5">, “he burned it by fire.” There are&nbsp;materials, which when added to gold, immediately, also burn&nbsp;the gold, i.e. blacken it. Such gold never regains its original&nbsp;colour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישק את בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “he made the Children of Israel drink </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font5">from this mixture</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">)”. </span><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning of the&nbsp;text, Moses did not intend to make the people drink, but to&nbsp;scatter the gold so that it would cease to exist. When the&nbsp;people drank from the water that the gold had been scattered&nbsp;into, an onlooker would gain the impression that he had seen&nbsp;someone drinking gold. Proof that this is the correct&nbsp;interpretation is found in Deuteronomy 9,21: ואכות אותו טחון, “I&nbsp;broke it to bits and ground it until it was fine as dust;” at that&nbsp;point Moses does not mention a word about making the&nbsp;Israelites drink it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,22. כי ברע הוא</span><span class="font5">, “that they are bent on evil;” they have&nbsp;evil intentions; if I had not had made the calf for them they&nbsp;would have crowned a king for themselves and the final&nbsp;result would have been bitter for them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Baaley Tossaphot)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויצא העגל הזה</span><span class="font5">, “this calf emerged;” it came out&nbsp;complete. We find a similar wording in Proverbs 25,4: ויצא&nbsp;לצורף כסף, “and it emerged for the silversmith as a silver&nbsp;vessel.” Aaron threw into the crucible assorted pieces of&nbsp;golden jewelry, and what emerged from the crucible was a&nbsp;fully formed golden calf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי פרוע הוא</span><span class="font5">, “that the people were completely out&nbsp;of control;” they had completely abandoned their Creator’s&nbsp;commandments. The root </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פרע </span><span class="font5">here is used in a similar sense&nbsp;as when Pharaoh accused Moses and Aaron as making the&nbsp;people completely unruly by promising them a holiday from&nbsp;hard labour for three days. ?למה </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">תפריעו</span><span class="font5"> את העם ממעשיו&nbsp;(Exodus 5,4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאספו אליו כל בני לוי</span><span class="font5">, “all the members of the tribe&nbsp;of Levi rallied around him.” According to the plain meaning of&nbsp;the text, the relatives of Moses, members of his tribe would&nbsp;not allow someone from another tribe to usurp Moses’&nbsp;authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כה אמר</span><span class="font5">, “thus has said the Lord, etc.;” where is&nbsp;G’d recorded as having said this? In Exodus 22,19: זובח&nbsp;לאלוהים יחרם, “whoever sacrifices to a god shall be&nbsp;proscribed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כשלשת אלפי איש</span><span class="font5">, “approximately three thousand&nbsp;men.” According to the plain meaning of the text, these three&nbsp;thousand men intended that their conduct should be viewed&nbsp;as idolatrous. This is why they had to be executed, just as&nbsp;the inhabitants of the idolatrous town in Deuteronomy&nbsp;chapter 14 have to be executed and their belongings have to&nbsp;be burned. (Based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Daat Baaley Tossaphot)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מלאו ידכם היום</span><span class="font5">, “dedicate yourselves today, etc.;”&nbsp;Moses tells these people that they had already proved their&nbsp;absolute loyalty to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> as they had not hesitated to kill&nbsp;members of their own family if those had been amongst the&nbsp;three thousand men mentioned in the last verse. This is also&nbsp;how our author understands Targum Onkelos on our verse.&nbsp;The point is not to understand Moses as using the&nbsp;expression: מלאו ידכם, as being in the future tense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולתת עליכם היום ברכה</span><span class="font5">, “and thereby bring G’d’s blessing upon yourselves this day.” This verse is the reason why, in&nbsp;his parting address to the Jewish people in Deuteronomy&nbsp;33,8-11, Moses singles out the tribe of Levi for a blessing&nbsp;although Yaakov, prior to his death had not done so. The&nbsp;reason that the tribe of Reuven received a blessing from&nbsp;Moses at that time, although that tribe too had not received a&nbsp;blessing from Yaakov, was that they had volunteered to be&nbsp;the vanguard of the army in the forthcoming battle with the&nbsp;Canaanites, having vowed not to rejoin their families on the&nbsp;east bank of the Jordan until all the other tribes had settled&nbsp;on their allotted territory. The tribe of Shimon, however, had&nbsp;neither received a blessing from Yaakov nor from Moses,&nbsp;due to their prince having cohabited provocatively with a&nbsp;Midianite princess, and because of the original Shimon’s part&nbsp;in the killing of all the males of the town of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: “and to bestow a blessing on you this day!|” Moses says here what he referred to in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 10,8 when he said: בעת ההיא הבדיל ה׳ את שבט</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">עד היום הזה הלוי לשאת את ארון ברית ה׳, “at that time </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">separated the tribe of Levi to become the bearers of the Holy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ark......until this day.” The new task of the Levites became</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">operational after the Tabernacle had been built and the Holy Ark had been transferred to there. From amongst the Levites,&nbsp;Aaron and his sons and their descendants were selected as&nbsp;replacing the duties which prior to the golden calf episode&nbsp;had been performed by the firstborn, who were the priests in&nbsp;each family where the firstborn was a son. They too became&nbsp;disqualified by having participated at the time at least&nbsp;passively in the dancing around the golden calf. According to&nbsp;tradition, they had even offered sacrifices on the altar Aaron&nbsp;had built. Part of Korach’s complaint was also that he should&nbsp;be qualified to offer sacrifices as he too was firstborn. (Our&nbsp;author has more to say about this in his commentary on&nbsp;Numbers 16,2.)</span></p>

Moses refers to the “Book of life”&nbsp;in which every human being is inscribed on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">if he was found deserving on the basis of his past record.&nbsp;This is based on the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;16, where the “book” is referred to as “the book of life,” in&nbsp;which the righteous are inscribed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מי אשר חטא לי אמחנו מספרי</span><span class="font5">, “I erase those that have&nbsp;sinned against me from My book;” This is the way I operate.&nbsp;However, I forego My right to erase your name from this&nbsp;book.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,34. ועתה לך נחה את העם </span><span class="font5">, “and now, go and lead the people!” G’d is telling Moses to resume his vocation as the&nbsp;leader of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הנה מלאכי ילך לפניך</span><span class="font5">, “My angel will walk ahead of you;” G’d refers to what he had told Moses already in Exodus 23,20:&nbsp;'הנה אנכי שולח מלאך וגו, “here I am going to send an angel, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וביום פקדי ופקדתי</span><span class="font5">, “but when the day comes that I make an accounting, I will make an accounting;” G’d promises Moses&nbsp;that as long as the Israelites will not accumulate </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">more</span><span class="font5"> sins&nbsp;He will not take any further action in respect of the sin of the&nbsp;golden calf. However if that day comes, He will add&nbsp;additional punishment for punishment so far withheld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,1. לך עלה מזה</span><span class="font5">, “go and set out from this place!” the reference in the word זה is the place where the sin of the&nbsp;golden calf had been committed. G’d is implying that at a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">different</span><span class="font5"> place He may be in a better position to exercise His&nbsp;right of forgiveness. The choice of the expression: עלה,&nbsp;“ascend,” indicated that anyone proceeding from the south in&nbsp;a northerly direction is automatically ascending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא שתו איש עדיו עליו</span><span class="font5">, “they did not adorn&nbsp;themselves with the jewelry and costly garments that they&nbsp;had taken with them from Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הורד עדיך מעליך</span><span class="font5">, “remove your jewelry from your&nbsp;persons!” this sounds strange as the Torah had already&nbsp;reported that the people had not put on their jewelry. They&nbsp;were told not to wear it, as it is more embarrassing to be&nbsp;denied the right to wear jewelry than to simply abstain from&nbsp;doing so from their own free will. In other words, by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">obeying&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">G’d’s command to abstain or even remove the jewelry they&nbsp;had taken another small step in their moral rehabilitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,7. ומשה יקח</span><span class="font5">, “Moses had taken, etc;” this has been written in the future tense as it relates to what he had done&nbsp;after bringing the second set of Tablets down from the&nbsp;Mountain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,8. והיה כצאת משה, </span><span class="font5">“it would be that whenever Moses came out, etc.;” this describes Moses leaving the camp of the&nbsp;Israelites in order to return to his private residence (tent).'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יקומו כל העם ונצבו, </span><span class="font5">“all the people would rise and remain standing at attention, on account of the Presence of G’d’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shechinah,</span><span class="font5"> which they knew would descend to above Moses’&nbsp;tent when he would arrive there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.10. וקם כל העם וישתחוו</span><span class="font5">, “and the entire nation would rise and prostrated themselves;” this describes what has&nbsp;been written in verse 8; seeing that these two verses were&nbsp;very long, the Torah decided to make sure the reader would&nbsp;not lose track of the subject. We find that the Torah used a&nbsp;similar method in Genesis 15,2, when it quotes Avraham&nbsp;asking G’d what possible enduring gift he could give him&nbsp;seeing that he had no biological heir. Avraham comes back&nbsp;to that subject in Genesis 15,3, “reminding” </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font5"> that he has&nbsp;no issue. We also find such a “reminder” when Yaakov and&nbsp;Lavan discuss his remuneration for looking after Lavan’s&nbsp;flocks in Genesis 30,27. There are numerous more examples&nbsp;of this type in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;פנים אל פנים</span><span class="font5">, “literally: “face to face,” an obviously&nbsp;incorrect translation, seeing that G’d does not possess&nbsp;physical attributes; Our author takes it for granted that the&nbsp;reader is aware of this, and does not spell it out. He does,&nbsp;however, indulge in presenting the reader with another&nbsp;insoluble problem, that of that either G’d or Moses must have&nbsp;changed position in order to speak to one another as if on&nbsp;the same level. He therefore tells us, his readers, that he&nbsp;does not know if the expression means that G’d had raised&nbsp;Moses closer to His level, or vice versa, i.e. that G’d had&nbsp;descended to Moses’ level. He had done so in Exodus 34,5,&nbsp;after the third forty days after the revelation at the Mountain&nbsp;had expired, i.e. on the Day of Atonement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושב אל המחנה</span><span class="font5">, “and he would return to the camp.” In Exodus 18,13, on the words: ויהי ממחרת, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments&nbsp;that the first set of Tablets were smashed on the 17<sup>th</sup> of&nbsp;Tammuz, that on the 18<sup>th</sup> i.e. the day following he burned the&nbsp;calf and punished those who had worshipped it, and that on&nbsp;the 19<sup>th</sup> he ascended the Mountain again. The problem is&nbsp;that both in Deut. 9,18 and in Exodus 18,13 he says that&nbsp;Moses ascended again on the eighteenth. Different super&nbsp;commentaries on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> attempt, each one in his own way, to&nbsp;resolve this apparent contradiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ראה אתה אומר אלי</span><span class="font5">, “See, You say to me:” the&nbsp;reason why we always read this paragraph on the Sabbath of&nbsp;the intermediate days of the festival of Passover and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">is because in this section all of the three pilgrimage festivals&nbsp;are mentioned. By mentioning these days as belonging to the&nbsp;festivals we derive the work prohibitions that apply on these&nbsp;days. The main point is the fact that the individual offerings&nbsp;the pilgrims have to present are to be offered on one of those&nbsp;days. (Compare Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chagigah</span><span class="font5"> folio 18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואתה לא הודעתני, </span><span class="font5">“and You have not informed me, etc.;” in verse 5 G’d had said: “and I will know what I can do for you.”&nbsp;In the meantime G’d had not revealed to Moses how He&nbsp;would punish the surviving members of Jewish people for&nbsp;their share in the episode of the golden calf. More&nbsp;specifically, He had not revealed if He was going to send an&nbsp;angel to lead them, or if He were to do this Himself,&nbsp;personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הודיעני נא את דרכיך</span><span class="font5">, “please instruct me in Your&nbsp;ways.” Moses wished G’d to instruct Him of His attributes.&nbsp;Once he had been instructed in those, he would be able to&nbsp;determine if he wished for the Jewish people to be led by one&nbsp;or more of G’d’ attributes or by is essence. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor Shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואדעך</span><span class="font5">, “so that I will know You more intimately and be able to cleave to You more closely;” As result, I will be able&nbsp;to find favour in Your eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וראה כי עמך הגוי הזה, “</span><span class="font5">and consider that this nation is Your people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והניחותי לך</span><span class="font5">, “and I will give you rest.” I will go with&nbsp;you until the conquest and give you rest from all your&nbsp;enemies.” Moses had quoted G’d to this effect when&nbsp;discussing the commandment to wipe out Amalek utterly In&nbsp;Deuteronomy 25,19. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,15. ויאמר אם אין פניך הולכים</span><span class="font5">, “he said (Moses to G’d) unless Your essence will go etc;” This is a completion of&nbsp;verse 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גם את הדבר אשר דברת אעשה</span><span class="font5">, “also the request you&nbsp;have made (now) I will fulfill;” “you have requested to take&nbsp;you into My confidence concerning My attributes, I will reveal&nbsp;them to you.” G’d did so by revealing the 13 attributes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הראני נא את כבודך</span><span class="font5">, “please give me visual access to&nbsp;Your Glory.” Moses asked for a visual appearance of G’d’s&nbsp;essence;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר אני אעביר את כל טובי על פניך</span><span class="font5">, “I will let all My</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">goodness pass before you (your eyes) [and identify each attribute of Mine. Ed.] This also is the completion of a subject&nbsp;G’d had already touched upon when He had said, (without&nbsp;specifying) in verse 17: (“I will also grant this wish of yours”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning Moses’ plea to be granted a visual revelation of G’d’s essence, however, He told him that this&nbsp;wish could not be fulfilled as long as his soul was attached to&nbsp;a body; in other words, he would have to wait until after his&nbsp;death. When Moses first heard G’d say that He would not be&nbsp;able to make out G’d’s features, he thought that perhaps it is&nbsp;not clear so that he could not identify different features.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to make clear to Moses that this was not the issue, He immediately told him what He would show him, i.e.&nbsp;from a safe distance when what he would see could not harm&nbsp;him physically; He told him that there was a “place” not far&nbsp;from where His essence was from which he could safely&nbsp;watch if not G’d’s “face” but His “back,” i.e. the result of His&nbsp;having visited that place. G’d’s attributes are recognisable by&nbsp;means of His manifest intervention in His universe and the&nbsp;changes that this intervention will result in. [Some of these&nbsp;words are mine. Editor.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some scholars interpret this verse differently; they do not understand Moses as having asked to actually “see” G’d&nbsp;with his physical eyes, and they remind us that this same&nbsp;Moses at the burning bush had reacted to a vision of the&nbsp;Divine by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hiding</span><span class="font5"> his face in fear. (Exodus 3,6) They therefore&nbsp;understand Moses as asking for a visual symbol that his&nbsp;request had been granted. This would serve as a covenant&nbsp;between G’d and himself. As a result, these sages&nbsp;understand Moses’ request as follows: “please show me&nbsp;Your glory by means of concluding a covenant with me,&nbsp;confirming what I requested and Your willingness to grant&nbsp;that request.” G’d consented to doing this, as we know from&nbsp;His saying: “I will let all My goodness pass before your eyes;”&nbsp;this was followed by G’d saying in Exodus 34,10: הנה אנכי&nbsp;כורת ברית נגד כל עמך אעשה נפלאות וגו', “Here I am concluding a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">covenant</span><span class="font5"> with you by displaying miracles in the presence of&nbsp;all of your people, etc. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אעביר</span><span class="font5">, “I shall </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">proclaim</span><span class="font5">;” We find this root in a similar context in Exodus 36,6, ויעבירו קול במחנה, “they </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">proclaimed&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">loudly throughout the camp, etc.;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל טובי</span><span class="font5">, “all My goodness;” G’d refers to the fact that He will treat not only the righteous with a positive attribute, but&nbsp;even the wicked, [by rewarding them for any good they have&nbsp;done in this life before they die. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וקראתי בשם ה' לפניך</span><span class="font5">, “I shall proclaim the name of the Tetragram in your presence;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains this as follows: I&nbsp;will teach you in which order to formulate your prayers for&nbsp;appealing to My attribute of Mercy even if by that time the&nbsp;merit of the patriarchs may have been exhausted; the order&nbsp;in which you and your people will appeal to Me will be&nbsp;patterned on the order in which I am about to reveal to you,&nbsp;after wrapping Myself in My </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tallit,</span><span class="font5"> [to prevent you from having&nbsp;to endure a visual revelation of My essence Ed.] I will call out&nbsp;to you the 13 attributes which follow in 23,5-7. This </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“tallit</span><span class="font5"> ”of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> is referred to again in 34,5, as well as in Job 38,9:&nbsp;בשומי ענן לבושו וערפל חתלתו, “when I clothed it in clouds,&nbsp;swaddled it in dense clouds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחנותי את אשר אחון</span><span class="font5">, “I shall grant grace to those Whom I deem it fit to do so.” [G’d does not write a blank cheque for&nbsp;Moses, but reserves for Himself the right, when He deems it&nbsp;appropriate to answer negatively to a prayer, or to answer&nbsp;positively to the prayer of those whom His creatures consider&nbsp;as undeserving of His mercy. Ed.] According to our author,&nbsp;this phrase, sounding almost like a postscript, is to be&nbsp;understood as referring to Moses having said in verse 16:&nbsp;ונפלינו אני ועמך מכל העם, “so that we are distinguished, I and&nbsp;Your people when compared to any other nation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי לא יראני האדם וחי</span><span class="font5">, “for as long as a human being&nbsp;is alive, he cannot experience My essence visually.”&nbsp;According to Rabbi Shimon the Yemenite,” the definition of a&nbsp;human being is that he is alive. But even celestial creatures&nbsp;named חיות are named thus to remind us that though they&nbsp;“live” forever, they too are not able to have a visual&nbsp;experience of G’d’s essence (Torah </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shleymah</span><span class="font5"> 131 on our&nbsp;verse.) If you were to counter that Isaiah 6,2 claimed to have&nbsp;experienced such a visual revelation when he said: ואראה את&nbsp;ה׳א-דוני יושב על כסא, “I have seen G’d seated on a throne,” this&nbsp;did not describe what is known as a clear vision, but as&nbsp;something at best like a reflection from a mirror; he had been&nbsp;screened by a partition at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונצבת</span><span class="font5">, “you shall stand;” the meaning of the word&nbsp;is to remain stationary, not advancing or planning to&nbsp;advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על הצור</span><span class="font5">, “on the rock;” another way of sayings: “on the top of the mountain.” This has been spelled out in Exodus&nbsp;34,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,23. וראית את אחורי</span><span class="font5">, “you will see My back;” you will see an aura of light which will linger after My essence has&nbsp;passed. The light which precedes Me and which is too&nbsp;dazzling, you will not see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,1. ויאמר ה' אל משה פסל לך</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Hashem</span><span class="font5"> said to Moses: “carve out for yourself, etc.;” This was said to Moses on the&nbsp;night of the 29<sup>th</sup> day of Av.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואיש לא יעלה עמך, </span><span class="font5">“and no one is to ascend with&nbsp;you.” On the first occasion after the revelation on Mount Sinai&nbsp;G’d’s instructions had been that before ascending the&nbsp;Mountain, Aaron Nadav and Avihu and the seventy elders&nbsp;were to accompany him part of the way. (Exodus 24,1) On&nbsp;this occasion the elders were too ashamed and kept their&nbsp;distance, on account of the people still being in a state of&nbsp;disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישכם משה בבקר, </span><span class="font5">Moses arose early on the morning&nbsp;of the 29<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Av.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ויקרא בשם ה</span><span class="font5">, “He called to him, using His name the&nbsp;tetragram.” G’d informed Moses regarding which of His&nbsp;attributes would accompany him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: G’d called to him what is written subsequently, i.e. the list of 13 of His attributes&nbsp;relevant to prayers that were primarily appeals for&nbsp;forgiveness. Our author likes this explanation, citing the fact&nbsp;that the words 'ה and על פניו, have been separated by a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p’sik,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">vertical line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ה', ה</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the repetition is to&nbsp;describe G’d‘s approachability before one has sinned with&nbsp;His approachability after one has sinned and repented. This&nbsp;is important seeing that sins such as idolatry, if not repented&nbsp;are treated as two sins, i.e. from the moment one&nbsp;contemplated to commit idolatry it is already considered&nbsp;sinful and punishable separately as soon as one had carried&nbsp;out that intention. This is based on Ezekiel 14,5 as&nbsp;interpreted in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kidushin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 40, למען&nbsp;תפוש את בית ישראל בלבם, “I will hold the house of Israel&nbsp;accountable for their thoughts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the sin of the spies was committed, the people were </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">held responsible for having had sinful thoughts&nbsp;previously, as they had not meant to reject the Hoy land until&nbsp;after they had been misled by the majority of the spies. This&nbsp;is what David refers to in Psalms 66,18: און אם ראיתי בלבי לא&nbsp;ישמע א-דוני, “if I had an evil thought in my mind, the Lord&nbsp;would not have listened to it.” In that verse G’d’s name&nbsp;appears only once, in order to make that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">א-ל</span><span class="font5">, the attribute of Justice, as for instance in Exodus 22,8: עד האלוהים יבא דבר שניהם, “the dispute of both parties has&nbsp;to be dealt with by a judge or a court.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">רחום</span><span class="font5">, “merciful;” He displays mercy for the poor and saves them from being taken advantage of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחנון, </span><span class="font5">“and gracious;” this attribute is also applied to the wealthy, as we know from Psalms 37,21: וצדיק תוע ונותן, “the&nbsp;righteous is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">generous</span><span class="font5"> and keeps giving.” The same&nbsp;expression in the same meaning also occurs in Genesis&nbsp;43,29: אלקים יחנך בני, “may G’d grant you grace my son&nbsp;(Joseph to Binyamin).” Compare also Numbers 6,25 on the&nbsp;word ויחנך in the priestly blessing, which is understood by&nbsp;commentators as a blessing in which the priest promises the&nbsp;recipient the G’d in whose name he recites the blessing is&nbsp;the One Who provides all living creatures with their daily&nbsp;needs. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor Shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארך אפים</span><span class="font5">, “slow to anger,” (Whose patience with man’s foibles) is long lasting. Our author quotes Daniel 7,12 as&nbsp;explaining the meaning of this term, saying that G’d grants&nbsp;an extension of life to those who have already forfeited it,&nbsp;waiting for the sinner to repent and change his way. Or, it&nbsp;may mean that by letting the sinner die </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> granting such&nbsp;an extension of life on earth to him, this is in order to ensure&nbsp;that this sinner does not lose his chance to have an afterlife&nbsp;by sinning further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: seeing that G’d is eternal He has great patience, seeing that He will always be able to&nbsp;exact judgment from the sinner, as opposed to a human&nbsp;being, who, because he is mortal, cannot always afford such&nbsp;patience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורב חסד</span><span class="font5">, “abounding in kindness;” He is on record as remembering good deeds of the patriarchs and their&nbsp;descendants for up to 1000 generations whereas sins are not&nbsp;remembered for more than 3-4 generations. (Compare&nbsp;Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah,</span><span class="font5"> folio 11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואמת</span><span class="font5">, “and faithful;” He keeps what He promises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,7. נושא עון ופשע</span><span class="font5">, “He welcomes the penitent, even those who sinned deliberately or out of obstinacy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונקה לא ינקה</span><span class="font5">, “but He does not let the sinner go </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">completely</span><span class="font5"> free of retribution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פוקד עון אבות</span><span class="font5">, “Who remembers the sins of the fathers;” [G’d explains why punishment is not meted out to the first&nbsp;generation of sinners, as if it were, mankind would soon be&nbsp;exterminated, there being no one free from sin. Ed.] When&nbsp;two people carry a burden it seems lighter than if one alone&nbsp;has to carry it. The same is true for three people carrying a&nbsp;load together. On the other hand, how long can G’d be&nbsp;perceived as ignoring our sins without inviting us to believe&nbsp;that He does not care or cannot exact penalties? He&nbsp;therefore imposes partial punishment, delaying the balance if&nbsp;the sinner does not repent, or forgiving the penitent sinner by&nbsp;delaying the unexpired guilt indefinitely. He therefore exacts&nbsp;that part from the third or fourth generation of the original&nbsp;sinner. [This is not unfair, as if the original sinner had&nbsp;received his entire punishment, the grandson would never&nbsp;have seen the light of day. Ed.] This is the thirteenth of the&nbsp;“visibly” beneficial attributes of G’d. If you were to counter&nbsp;that the Torah has written: לא יומתו אבות על בנים, “children&nbsp;must not be executed for the sins of the fathers,” (Deut.&nbsp;24,16) this applied to the human tribunal, not to the celestial&nbsp;tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,8. וימהר משה “</span><span class="font5">Moses hastened;” Moses was afraid that G’d would continue mentioning even later generations&nbsp;than the fourth generation, he hastened to express his&nbsp;gratitude for what had been revealed to him at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation: Moses’ haste at this point was because he had the feeling that G’d was about to depart and&nbsp;he wanted to be able to offer his prayer before He departed&nbsp;and became hidden behind a cloud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is also what our sages meant when they said: “when is the best time for a human being to ask for his&nbsp;needs? When G’d is manifestly present.” (Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avodah Zarah</span><span class="font5"> folio 7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,9. אם נא מצאתי חן בעיניך ה' ילך נא ה׳ בקרבנו</span><span class="font5">, “if I have&nbsp;indeed found favour in Your eyes o G’d, may the Lord walk&nbsp;among us, please.” The attribute Moses addresses in this&nbsp;verse is both times the attribute of His name spelled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Adonai.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי עם קשי עורף הוא</span><span class="font5">, “although it is a stiff-necked people.” Moses concurred with G’d Who had described this people as&nbsp;“stiff-necked” in Exodus 33,3. G’d had used it as an excuse&nbsp;for not walking amongst that people. Moses uses this very&nbsp;fact as </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">justifying</span><span class="font5"> his request that G’d remain present among&nbsp;them. What better restraining influence against the evil urge&nbsp;is there than the very presence of G’d, the Creator, being in&nbsp;its midst?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of this argument: “Even though they are a stiff-necked people.” We find the same&nbsp;logic in Psalms 25,11: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וסלחת לעוני כי רב הוא</span><span class="font5">, “forgive my sin&nbsp;even though it be great.” Why do I plead that You walk&nbsp;amongst us? Because the angel has no authority to forgive&nbsp;any trespasses against You, as You, Yourself have pointed&nbsp;out. It is therefore better that seeing that they are a stiff&nbsp;necked people, You should be there to forgive one sin of the&nbsp;people at a time, instead of letting them accumulate sins&nbsp;which, collectively, will prove too difficult to forgive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונחלתנו</span><span class="font5">, “and consider us as Your inheritance.” Moses means: “and thus make certain that we will inherit the land&nbsp;which You have promised on oath.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find a similar construction in Numbers 34,17: אלה ראשי האבות אשר ינחלו את בני ישראל</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">these are the names of the&nbsp;men through whom the land shall be apportioned to you.”&nbsp;The word ינחלו is to be understood as if in the causative&nbsp;mode, i.e. ינחילו.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,10. הנה אנכי כורת ברית</span><span class="font5">, “I hereby make a covenant, etc.” G’d promises to walk </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the Children of Israel. He&nbsp;adds: “concerning your question (33,16) ‘how will it be known&nbsp;that both I and Your people are distinguished?’” The answer&nbsp;is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נגד כל עמך אעשה נפלאות</span><span class="font5">, “I will perform miracles in full view of your whole people the like of which I have never&nbsp;performed on earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the covenant G’d speaks of here is the one spelled out in detail in verse 27: where it is&nbsp;made clear that a new covenant was necessary as the&nbsp;people had broken the original covenant as stated there: כי&nbsp;על פי הדברים האלה כרתי אתך ברית ואת ישראל, “for according to&nbsp;these commandments (words) I have made a covenant with&nbsp;you and with Israel.” The commandments referred to are the&nbsp;observance of the three pilgrimage festivals that have been&nbsp;listed already in Exodus 23,16: Passover, Pentecost and the&nbsp;festival of huts. They are repeated here as a reminder, as all&nbsp;three are related directly to the Exodus from Egypt. Seeing&nbsp;that the subject came up, the law concerning sanctification of&nbsp;the firstborn males of humans and pure animals, as well as&nbsp;the donkeys, is also mentioned here again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי נורא הוא</span><span class="font5">, “for it is awesome;” this is a reference to Moses having returned from the Mountain while his face was&nbsp;radiating light so strong that the people were scared of him.&nbsp;(34,30)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,11. שמר לך את אשר אנכי מצוך היום</span><span class="font5">, “Observe that which I command you this day!” G’d warns that whereas He had&nbsp;pardoned the people for the sins committed in the past, that&nbsp;from now on they have to be on guard not to sin again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.17. אלהי מסכה לא תעשה לך</span><span class="font5">, “you must not make&nbsp;yourself a molten image!” This is a reminder of the golden&nbsp;calf. What applies to molten images also applies in equal&nbsp;measure to temples dedicated to idolatry. The reason why&nbsp;this prohibition has been repeated here is that Aaron had&nbsp;thrown pieces of gold into a crucible and nonetheless a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">fully&nbsp;formed</span><span class="font5"> golden calf had emerged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את חג המצות</span><span class="font5">, the festival of matzot, etc.; all the&nbsp;commandments listed in this paragraph up to and including&nbsp;verse 26, are symbols of the fact that you have become&nbsp;servants of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> and that on the festivals named, the&nbsp;servants present their master with a gift expressing their&nbsp;fondness of |Him as well as their subservience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל פטר רחם לי</span><span class="font5">, “the first fruit of the womb belongs&nbsp;to Me.” Earlier, this expression had included </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font5"> domestic&nbsp;animal, now each species of animal has been named&nbsp;separately to show to which species this law applies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,20 ופטר חמור תפדה</span><span class="font5">, “and the firstborn male donkey you shall redeem;” why is this repeated? It is not fit as a&nbsp;sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יראו פני ריקם</span><span class="font5">, “neither the firstborn males nor their children who make the pilgrimage must not appear before&nbsp;Me empty-handed as they belong to Me. They must offer&nbsp;sacrifices to Me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יראו פני ריקם</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> quoting a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">baraitha </span><span class="font5">in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5">, this phrase is superfluous and has been&nbsp;written primarily to enable us to learn a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">g’zeyrah shavveh,</span><span class="font5"> to&nbsp;teach us that the amount that a slave that has to be freed&nbsp;after six years of service must be given as a gift, must have&nbsp;the value of five shekels, i.e. the amount paid by the father to&nbsp;a priest when redeeming his firstborn son. He also uses the&nbsp;word: ריקם “empty-handed,” which appears in both&nbsp;legislations [and appears to derive that rule as it is otherwise&nbsp;unnecessary, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ששת ימים תעבוד, </span><span class="font5">“during six day you are to perform labour;” perhaps the reason why this is repeated once more&nbsp;is because of the Torah links it to agricultural work during the&nbsp;growing season, i.e. בחריש ובקציר, plowing and harvesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וחג שבעות</span><span class="font5">, “and the festival of weeks.” This is the&nbsp;season of the early wheat harvest and the first fruit from the&nbsp;orchards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחג האסיף</span><span class="font5">, “and the festival of ingathering;” the end of the harvesting season around the time of the equinox in the&nbsp;autumn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שלש פעמים</span><span class="font5">, “three times;” the Torah repeats this&nbsp;again because of what follows, i.e. that no one will steal your&nbsp;harvests while you make a pilgrimage to the Temple to thank&nbsp;the Lord for His bounty.(verse 24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי אוריש גוים מפניך והרחבתי את גבולך</span><span class="font5">, “When I will&nbsp;drive out nations on your account and expand your&nbsp;boundaries;” seeing that the season when you make the&nbsp;pilgrimages is one in which G’d is especially well disposed&nbsp;toward you, I shall expand your boundaries beyond what I&nbsp;had promised Avraham. The reference is to the lands of&nbsp;Sichon and Og which are on the East bank of the Jordan and&nbsp;had not been included in G’d’s original promise. There had&nbsp;been a fear that seeing these lands had not been promised&nbsp;to Avraham, the survivors of these lands would attempt to&nbsp;reclaim it. G’d reassures the people that their temporary&nbsp;absence during pilgrimages to the Temple would not be&nbsp;exploited by their neighbours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[I do not understand this a) as these lands were conquered </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the Israelites had made a single pilgrimage&nbsp;in the West bank to the Temple, and they were still eating&nbsp;manna, not having had what to harvest. b) Moreover, at the&nbsp;covenant between the pieces in Genesis 15,18 G’d had&nbsp;promised that the north eastern borders of these lands would&nbsp;be at the river Euphrates, far from the boundaries of the&nbsp;lands of Sichon and Og, even. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תשחט על חמץ דם זבחי</span><span class="font5">, “Do not slaughter (offer)&nbsp;the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explains that this verse is a warning not to offer the Passover&nbsp;lamb at an hour when the use of leavened products is still&nbsp;permissible. All of the people invited to eat from that lamb are&nbsp;included in this prohibition. Compare the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">baraitha in&nbsp;Pessachim 63.</span><span class="font5"> It is stated there that this prohibition is one of&nbsp;the negative commandments. When is that commandment&nbsp;applicable? As long as either the person slaughtering the&nbsp;lamb, sprinkling its blood, or a guest invited to partake of it,&nbsp;still has leavened products in his possession on Passover&nbsp;eve. It had to be inserted here as previously, in 23,18, this&nbsp;had not been spelled out. Here it is called: “the meat offering&nbsp;of the Passover festival.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא ילין לבקר </span><span class="font5">“and none of it must be left over until morning.” In 23,18, the Torah had referred only to the&nbsp;entrails, etc., not the edible parts of the meat. Here it refers&nbsp;specifically to the edible parts of the sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ראשית בכורי אדמת, </span><span class="font5">“the choice first fruits of your&nbsp;soil, etc.” this has been repeated here because when this&nbsp;legislation was first mentioned, it had not mentioned the&nbsp;seven Canaanite tribes on whose land this would apply. In&nbsp;this chapter in verse 11, these details have been supplied (as&nbsp;opposed to 23,19.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו</span><span class="font5">, “do not boil a kid in the milk of its mother.” This is a warning not to wait with offering such a kid&nbsp;as an offering until it has been fully weaned, but once it has&nbsp;grown -beyond the first seven days of its life- it is fit for the&nbsp;altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,27. על פי הדברים האלה</span><span class="font5">, “in accordance with these words, etc.;” “these words,” are the warnings to refrain from&nbsp;anything remotely resembling idolatry. Even concluding a&nbsp;political agreement with neighbouring countries is considered&nbsp;something akin to idolatry, in view of the fact that it may lead&nbsp;to intermarriage between Jews and gentiles. It might also&nbsp;prevent you to observe the pilgrimage festivals during which&nbsp;you confirm your loyalty to Torah by presenting yourselves to&nbsp;the G’d Who had given you His Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כרתי אתך ברית, </span><span class="font5">“the covenant I concluded with you was conditional on your observing these words.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ויהי שם עם ה</span><span class="font5">, “he remained there with the Lord,&nbsp;etc.” this was the third time that Moses spent 40 days on the&nbsp;Mountain. He ascended at dawn on the twenty ninth day of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Av,</span><span class="font5"> and remained there until dawn of the tenth day of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey,</span><span class="font5"> better known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yom Hakippurim.</span><span class="font5"> If you were to ask&nbsp;how Moses could tell day and night from each other, seeing&nbsp;that in the celestial regions day and night are all the same,&nbsp;seeing that we have a verse in Daniel 2,22 ונהורא עמיה שריה,&nbsp;“and light dwells with Him?” We also a verse in Psalms</span></p>
<p dir="rtl"><span class="font5">,גם חשך לא יחשיך ממך ולילה כיום יאיר כחשכת אורך :139,12</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“darkness is not dark for You; night is as light as day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We need to answer that when G’d taught Moses the written Torah, he knew that it was daytime down on earth.&nbsp;When He taught him the oral Torah, he knew that it was night&nbsp;on earth at that time. Furthermore, when he observed the&nbsp;moon and the stars bowing down to the Lord, he knew that it&nbsp;must be daytime on earth, as these celestial bodies had to&nbsp;perform their duties on earth at night. When he observed the&nbsp;sun paying its respect to G’d, he knew that it was night on&nbsp;earth, as during the daylight hours the sun had to perform its&nbsp;duties on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויכתוב על הלוחות, </span><span class="font5">”He wrote on the Tablets;” G’d did the writing, as confirmed in Deuteronomy 10,2: “I shall write on&nbsp;the Tablets,” and in Deuteronomy 10,4 Moses confirms; “He&nbsp;wrote on the Tablets exactly as He had done on the first set&nbsp;of Tablets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי ברדת משה</span><span class="font5">, “it happened that when Moses was&nbsp;descending, etc.” This was on a Tuesday the tenth day of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey,</span><span class="font5"> after Moses having been on the Mountain for the&nbsp;third time for forty days;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושני לוחות העדות, </span><span class="font5">“and the two Tablets of the Testimony in his hand, etc.;” what is missing here is a reference to the&nbsp;ark within which these Tablets were to be placed. This has&nbsp;been included in Moses’ report in Deuteronomy 10,3. Moses&nbsp;had constructed an ark for the Tablets in which they were&nbsp;kept from the tenth day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey</span><span class="font5"> until the first day of Nissan,&nbsp;when the Tabernacle was erected and the Tablets were&nbsp;transferred to the Holy Ark that had been constructed by&nbsp;Betzalel, and the Ark and the Tablets were placed in the Holy&nbsp;of Holies, in the westernmost section of the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומשה לא ידע כי קרן עור פניו</span><span class="font5">, Moses was not aware that the skin of his face radiated light. When G’d had placed His hand&nbsp;on his face to shield him when His glory passed and he stood&nbsp;in the opening of a cave in the rock (compare 33,22), he&nbsp;merited this reminder of that encounter. The reason that he&nbsp;merited this reminder which he had not merited when he&nbsp;carried the first set of Tablets, was that the first set of Tablets&nbsp;had been given publicly for everyone to see, whereas at the&nbsp;introduction to his ascent to receive the second set the Torah&nbsp;had expressly warned that that no one was to accompany&nbsp;him even at the bottom of the Mountain (verse 3). Seeing&nbsp;that the giving of the firsts set of Tablets was accompanied&nbsp;by so much publicity, if there had been no visible evidence&nbsp;that Moses had received a second set some people might&nbsp;have thought that he himself had written on the Tablets&nbsp;seeing that the raw material had been taken up on the&nbsp;Mountain with him, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: Seeing that prior to Moses’ return with the first set of Tablets the people had been&nbsp;prepared to accept another leader in Moses’ place, his&nbsp;emitting rays of light on his descent from the Mountain this&nbsp;time made a repetition of such an attempt quite unlikely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וייראו מגשת אליו</span><span class="font5">, “they were afraid to approach&nbsp;him.” According to the plain meaning of the verse when they&nbsp;beheld him, they thought that they were looking at an angel.&nbsp;(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah by Rabbi Menachem Kasher&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">item 241 on this verse)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרא אליהם </span><span class="font5">משה, “Moses called out to them.”&nbsp;When the people heard his voice they realised that he was&nbsp;not an angel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישובו אליו </span><span class="font5">“they turned back to face him.” From this verse it is clear that initially they had turned their back on him&nbsp;out of fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וידבר משה אליהם</span><span class="font5">, Moses spoke to them. They noticed that no harm had come to them from his speaking to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.32. את כל אשר דבר ה' אתו בהר סיני</span><span class="font5">, “all the commandments that G’d had spoken to him about while he&nbsp;had been on Mount Sinai on his first and third stay on the&nbsp;Mountain, as well as all the commandments that He had&nbsp;communicated to him from Nissan when they had left Egypt&nbsp;until the twentieth of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Iyar</span><span class="font5"> in the second year when they broke&nbsp;camp around the Mountain. However, according to the&nbsp;Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin</span><span class="font5"> folio 60, the written Torah, i.e. in&nbsp;scroll form, he wrote down personally, one parchment at a&nbsp;time. When Moses made ready to leave this earth, he&nbsp;arranged these parchments in the order in which we read&nbsp;them nowadays according to the order he considered&nbsp;appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויכל משה מדבר אתם</span><span class="font5">, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">When</span><span class="font5"> Moses had finished&nbsp;speaking with them, etc,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ובבא משה לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “whenever Moses went in (the&nbsp;Tabernacle) to face </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> etc.; either when the&nbsp;communication had been initiated by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> or when&nbsp;Moses had occasion to speak to the people, he did not wear&nbsp;the veil on his face; the reason was, as we learned from&nbsp;Isaiah 30,20: והיו עיניך רואות את </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">מוריך</span><span class="font5">, “your eyes shall be able&nbsp;to see your teacher.” The word: מוריך in that verse refers to&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">G’d</span><span class="font5"> Who is your teacher. What G’d was to Moses, Moses&nbsp;was to the people. Just as Moses had not worn a veil when&nbsp;facing G’d and being taught the Torah, so it was not&nbsp;appropriate for him to wear a veil when teaching Torah to the&nbsp;people. When the Torah wrote: והשיב משה את המסוה, “Moses&nbsp;put the veil back on his face,” he did so in order that the&nbsp;people did not have to look at how his forehead emitted the&nbsp;rays of light as it would lose its character of being something&nbsp;holy. Seeing that it was a reflection of the Presence of G’d in&nbsp;miniature, the people were not to relate to it as something&nbsp;that they could feast their eyes on. [Compare Exodus 24 1011 from which it is clear that such an attitude was sinful. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression מסוה, is based on the word סותה, (compare Genesis 49,11, ובדם ענבים </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">סותה</span><span class="font5">, “his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">robe</span><span class="font5"> in blood&nbsp;of grapes”)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Vayakhel</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקהל משה את כל עדת בני ישראל, </span><span class="font5">“Moses assembled&nbsp;the entire congregation of the Children of Israel;” he did so as&nbsp;soon as he had descended from the Mountain with the&nbsp;second set of Tablets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלה הדברים</span><span class="font5">, “these are the words;” he wished to tell them that he had authorization to proceed with the building of the&nbsp;Tabernacle in which G’d would have his residence on earth.&nbsp;He warned them that in spite of what appears to be a task of&nbsp;the highest priority, even that task must not interfere with the&nbsp;regular observance of the Sabbaths and the restrictions to&nbsp;perform creative activity on that day. The rationale of this&nbsp;was to teach the people that just as the Tabernacle is G’d’s,&nbsp;so the Sabbath is G’d’s, i.e. it is the holiest day in the&nbsp;universe, and that is why on occasion the Day of Atonement&nbsp;is called שבת שבתון, “the Sabbath in its ultimate degree.” The&nbsp;Torah applies that same definition to the Sabbath here. Work&nbsp;on the Tabernacle cannot override the sanctity of the&nbsp;Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ששת ימים</span><span class="font5">, “during six days, etc;” the Torah repeats&nbsp;itself so as to make clear that this rule applies also to the&nbsp;work on the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תבערו אש</span><span class="font5">, “do not kindle a fire;” some of our&nbsp;Rabbis claim that the reason that of all the work prohibitions&nbsp;on the Sabbath, only the act of kindling a fire has been&nbsp;singled out by name, is to teach us that lighting a fire is the&nbsp;only one of these prohibitions which, instead of being&nbsp;punishable by death when performed knowingly, is&nbsp;punishable only by 39 lashes, as are other negative&nbsp;commandments when violated on purpose. This is the view&nbsp;of Rabbi Yossi in the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 70.&nbsp;Rabbi Nathan, on the other hand, holds that the reason why&nbsp;this mode of activity has been singled out by name is: לחלק</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">i.e. to give us a definition of the nature of the activities that&nbsp;are prohibited on the Sabbath. It was singled out as a basic&nbsp;activity. Just as this activity is prohibited on the Sabbath on&nbsp;pain of death, so are all the other activities which were&nbsp;indispensable for building a Tabernacle equally forbidden to&nbsp;be performed on any Sabbath for any purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Any activity required to be performed for building or functioning of the Tabernacle is considered a basic activity,&nbsp;or אב מלאכה, in Hebrew, and is punishable separately even if&nbsp;performed as part of a number of activities. We have a rule in&nbsp;the Talmud, that if something had at one time been part of a&nbsp;number of items under the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> heading, and had&nbsp;subsequently been singled out, it was singled out as an&nbsp;example in order to teach that what applies to it now, also&nbsp;applies to the other items that it had been part of under the&nbsp;same heading, i.e. been under the same “umbrella.” In our&nbsp;situation it means that the other 38 types of basic activities&nbsp;connected with the construction of the Tabernacle or its&nbsp;functions must also not be performed on the Sabbath, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">each&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">such on pain of death. This is the way in which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explains the verse in general terms. The reason why just the&nbsp;activity of kindling light was chosen by the Torah as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">example</span><span class="font5"> in question, is that lighting a fire is something that&nbsp;for the onlooker hardly seems like an activity at all, involving&nbsp;neither skill, nor physical strain. If you were to say that&nbsp;granted that actually lighting a fire on the Sabbath is&nbsp;forbidden, but activities preparatory to lighting a fire after the&nbsp;Sabbath are permitted, this too is prohibited. The Sabbath is&nbsp;not a day to be used as a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">preparation</span><span class="font5"> for the activities on the&nbsp;six weekdays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the reason that the legislation about work prohibition is repeated here is in order that&nbsp;people would not say that just as in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Bo</span><span class="font5"> (Exodus&nbsp;12,16) certain kinds of work were prohibited on the festivals,&nbsp;but preparation of food-necessitating lighting a fire- was&nbsp;exempted, the same was true during the Sabbaths during&nbsp;which work on the Tabernacle was in progress. The Torah&nbsp;therefore categorically prohibited this kind of work, implying&nbsp;that, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">of course,</span><span class="font5"> all other kind of work would be prohibited&nbsp;also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בכל מושבותיכם</span><span class="font5">, in all of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> dwellings, i.e. the Tabernacle was exempt from all of these restrictions as it&nbsp;was not a residence for </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">human</span><span class="font5"> beings. Communal sacrifices&nbsp;were offered as usual. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mechilta Vayakhel</span><span class="font5"> 7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,11. את בריחו</span><span class="font5">, “its bolts;” the reading is as if it had&nbsp;been spelled בריחיו.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,17. את עמדיו ואת אדניה</span><span class="font5">, “its pillars and its sockets.” Anything which is not a living creature is sometimes referred&nbsp;to in the masculine mode and other times in the feminine&nbsp;mode. The following examples are proof of this rule: המחנה&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">האחת</span><span class="font5"> והכהו, “one of the camps, and he smites it” (Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">32.8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;המחנה </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">הנשאר</span><span class="font5">, “the remaining camp;” (same verse) רוח&nbsp;גדולה </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">וחזק</span><span class="font5">, “a great and powerful wind,” (Kings I 19,11). והרים&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ממנו מקמצו מסולת המנחה;</span><span class="font5"> our author quotes more examples; he&nbsp;adds that on occasion even living creatures are referred to&nbsp;sometimes as feminine and sometimes as masculine;&nbsp;example: אם בהמה אשר יקריבו </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ממנה</span><span class="font5"> כל אשר יתן </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ממנו</span><span class="font5">, “and if the&nbsp;beast (feminine) from which he will offer parts as a sacrifice,&nbsp;every part that he will give from it (masculine), etc.” (Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">27.9) .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of our verse: the word: עמודיו refers to the posts supporting the קלעים, ‘the hangings”&nbsp;around the courtyards, and the word: אדניה, refers to the&nbsp;courtyard itself, the חצר, that word being feminine, (as we&nbsp;know from Kings I 6,36)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,22. ויבואו האנשים על הנשים</span><span class="font5">, the men came “upon” the women, to take away their jewelry in order to use them for&nbsp;building the Tabernacle, as we will read presently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the word על in this verse means: “with;” in other words, the men did no volunteer their&nbsp;own jewelry as gifts for to building the Tabernacle until </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the women had already done so by removing their own&nbsp;jewelry. The use of the word על as meaning “with,” we know&nbsp;already from Leviticus 25,31 על שדה הארץ יחשב, “it will be&nbsp;considered as belonging </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the open country.” Or,&nbsp;Numbers 19,5: על פרשה ישרף, “it will be burned together </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">its dung.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חח</span><span class="font5">, jewelry worn in the ear;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נזם, </span><span class="font5">jewelry worn in the nose;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">טבעת, jewelry worn on the fingers;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כומוז</span><span class="font5">, jewelry worn on the arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35, 27. והנשיאים הביאו</span><span class="font5">, “and the princes had brought;” they had taken these things with them at the time when the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Israelites had “emptied” Egypt of all their valuables (Exodus 12,36) each taking items appropriate to their social status.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,28. למאור</span><span class="font5">. “for lighting.” The letter ל, has a semi&nbsp;vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va</span><span class="font5"> under it. [instead of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,34. ולהורות</span><span class="font5">, “and to give instruction,” (to others.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מדי העבודה</span><span class="font5">, “than what is required for the work;” the&nbsp;prefix letter מ in this word is superfluous, just as in Psalms&nbsp;119,99: מכל מלמדי השכלתי, “I have become wiser through all&nbsp;those who have taught me something.”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויעבירו קול במחנה</span><span class="font5">, “they sounded a proclamation&nbsp;throughout the camp;” this could have been expressed with&nbsp;one word, i.e.: ויכריזו. This is why our sages derived from this&nbsp;that it is forbidden on the Sabbath to carry something from&nbsp;one domain to another. They used the apparently&nbsp;superfluous word </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ויעבירו,</span><span class="font5"> and compared it to the same word&nbsp;in Leviticus 25,9: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">והעברת</span><span class="font5"> שופר תרועה, “you shall make a&nbsp;proclamation by means of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar,</span><span class="font5"> followed by the word&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">תעבירו</span><span class="font5"> in the same sentence.” [in the Jubilee year. Ed.] Just&nbsp;as carrying is prohibited on the Day of Atonement, (a day&nbsp;also known as שבת שבתון) so it is prohibited on any other day&nbsp;called Sabbath</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל יעשו עוד מלאכה</span><span class="font5">, “let them not perform any more work, etc.;” we know the meaning of the word מלאכה here, because&nbsp;the Torah continues with: ויכלא העם מהביא, “the people were&nbsp;stopped from bringing more.” In other words: מלאכה=הבאה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,8. את המשכן, עשר יריעות</span><span class="font5">, the inner curtains serving as the ceiling of the Tabernacle, ten each; they were the first&nbsp;parts of the Tabernacle to be constructed. This was followed&nbsp;by the structure itself, over which these curtains were spread,&nbsp;the structure being the most </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">important</span><span class="font5"> part, they being the&nbsp;most </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">beloved</span><span class="font5"> part. Following this, all the furnishings of the&nbsp;Tabernacle, inside and outside were constructed. This was&nbsp;followed by making the hanging curtains of the courtyard&nbsp;around it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כרובים מעשה חושב</span><span class="font5">, “cherub-like figures skillfully woven into the fabric by human hands”. When the Torah describes&nbsp;the ten curtain like carpets forming the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">lowest</span><span class="font5"> of the four&nbsp;layers of the Tabernacle’s “roof,” figures which were visible to&nbsp;people allowed into the Sanctuary, the Torah added the&nbsp;words: מעשה אדם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“made by man.” The other eleven carpets&nbsp;above the first ten, which were not seen by anyone, did not&nbsp;have any such pictures woven into them, as who would be&nbsp;there to appreciate them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,29. והיו תואמים ויחדו יהיו תמים</span><span class="font5">, ”they would match twin like, exactly at the bottom, and join together into a ring at the&nbsp;top (so that they will be eight);” the verse is to be understood&nbsp;as follows: the word יהיו next to the word יחדו is to be&nbsp;understood as in the present tense as in Exodus 18,26: יביאון&nbsp;אל משה “they would bring to Moses,“ or as at the end of that&nbsp;verse: ישפוטון הן, “they would judge.” The author cites more&nbsp;such examples of words sounding as if in the future tense&nbsp;really describing the present tense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,36. ויעש לה ארבעה עמודי שטים</span><span class="font5">, “he made for it (the dividing curtain) four pillars of acacia wood.” We have&nbsp;explained already on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Trumah</span><span class="font5"> 26,32, why the pillars&nbsp;for the dividing curtain and the pillars at the entrance to the&nbsp;Tabernacle were required, and their respective numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,38. וצפה ראשיהם וחשוקיהם זהב</span><span class="font5">, “and he overlaid their tops and their fillets with gold.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">commentary on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Pekudey,</span><span class="font5"> Betzalel divined some&nbsp;matters which even his teacher Moses had not instructed him&nbsp;in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37, 27. על שתי צלעותיו על שני צדיו</span><span class="font5">, “upon the two ribs thereof, on the two sides thereof.” There is some duplication&nbsp;of words here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">37,29. ויעש את שמן המשחה</span><span class="font5">, “he made the holy anointing oil;” why was this verse inserted at this juncture? The&nbsp;question is in place as we would have expected the Torah to&nbsp;have written this verse after all the vessels that required&nbsp;anointing had been completed, seeing that the work of the&nbsp;copper altar as well as the washbasin and its stand had not&nbsp;yet been completed as well as other portable utensils which&nbsp;would require to be ritually pure? Rabbi Chavell speculates&nbsp;that seeing that no one answered this question, and we know&nbsp;that many parts of the Tabernacle were ultimately hidden to&nbsp;prevent them falling into enemy hands, the holy anointing oil,&nbsp;which according to tradition never diminished even after use,&nbsp;was also something that was hidden, whereas the copper&nbsp;altar and the washbasin were not considered holy enough to&nbsp;have to be hidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38,8. במראות הצובאות</span><span class="font5">, “with the mirrors of the serving women.” The word מראות is based on ראיה, “eyesight.” The&nbsp;laver was placed between the entrance to the Tabernacle&nbsp;and the copper altar (the altar on which most sacrifices were&nbsp;offered) slightly north of center. It was placed there so that&nbsp;the women who had contributed their mirrors could see it&nbsp;from the section in the courtyard reserved for women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would also serve as a reminder that women whose husbands suspected them of infidelity without having proof&nbsp;that could be presented at court, and who had denied the&nbsp;accusation, would have to drink “bitter” waters drawn from&nbsp;the water in the laver, and would risk their lives by doing so if&nbsp;they had lied. [Compare Numbers 5,11-31.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the prefix ב in the word במראות is to be understood as if it had been the letter מ, so that the word&nbsp;means: ”from the (material) of which their mirrors was made&nbsp;of,” i.e. polished copper. Exchanging the letter מ for the letter&nbsp;ב, is not unique. One example is found in Leviticus 8,32:&nbsp;והנותר בבשר ובלחם, “and whatever remains </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font5"> the meat and&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font5"> the bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר צבאו פתח אהל מועד</span><span class="font5">, “who assembled at the entrance of the Tent of meeting.” They did so in order to pray and&nbsp;recite the praises of the Almighty as near to the sacred&nbsp;compound as was allowable for ordinary Israelites who were&nbsp;ritually pure. They also wished to receive the blessings by&nbsp;the priests and Levites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38,15. מזה ומזה</span><span class="font5">, “on this side and on that side.” These&nbsp;words apply to the two verses 14 and 15, each set of&nbsp;hanging curtains being on either side of the entrance gate to&nbsp;the courtyard.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Pekudey</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אלה פקודי המשכן</span><span class="font5">, “these are the accounts of the&nbsp;Tabernacle;” which “Tabernacle” does the Torah refer to?&nbsp;“The Tabernacle that is testimony to the covenant between&nbsp;G’d and Israel, משכן העדות.” Seeing that this is not the only&nbsp;time the Torah used the expression: משכן, as it also occurs in&nbsp;Numbers 16,27, when it referred to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mishkan</span><span class="font5"> of Korach,&nbsp;as well as several times in the Book of prophets, the Torah&nbsp;wished to be precise beyond doubt. There was never another&nbsp;Tabernacle in which the Holy Ark containing the Tablets was&nbsp;housed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ובצלאל בן אורי בן חור וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and Betzalel, son of Uri,&nbsp;son of Chur, etc.;” he also constructed items that his teacher&nbsp;Moses had not specifically instructed him to construct, as he&nbsp;was on the same spiritual wavelength as his teacher. [Our&nbsp;author had already made this point on Exodus 36,38. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי זהב התנופה</span><span class="font5">, “all the gold used for the waveoffering amounted to, etc.;” the reason why the Torah used&nbsp;the expression תנופה, here, an expression usually used only&nbsp;with specific offerings for specific purposes by an individual&nbsp;donor, is that when presenting his gift, the owner had had to&nbsp;lift it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'תשע ועשרים ככר וגו, </span><span class="font5">twenty nine talents, plus. seven hundred and thirty shekels; for anyone interested, the total&nbsp;amount of gold used in the construction of the Tabernacle&nbsp;amounted to 1460 liters” [we are not familiar with the units&nbsp;used by our author that his readers in France were obviously&nbsp;familiar with Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכסף פקודי העדה</span><span class="font5">, “and the silver that was counted&nbsp;which had been contributed by the congregation, etc.: the&nbsp;Torah spells out in detail what exactly all the silver and&nbsp;copper donated was used for. The reason for this is that the&nbsp;silver was used as ransom for the people who had somehow&nbsp;become guilty during the episode of the golden calf. The&nbsp;reason why the Torah does not enumerate in detail what the&nbsp;gold was used for is that no item was wholly made of gold&nbsp;except for the candlestick and the cover for the Holy Ark. All&nbsp;the other furnishings were only overlaid with gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מאת ככר ואלף ושבע מאות וחמשה שקלים</span><span class="font5">, one hundred talents and seventeen hundred and fifty shekels.” [One </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kikar</span><span class="font5"> used&nbsp;for sacred purposes was equivalent to 3000 “holy” shekels,&nbsp;or 6000 ordinary shekels of silver. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.26.</span><span class="font5"> 1 ,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בקע לגלגלת </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">beka,</span><span class="font5"> per head (half a holy shekel). The people relied on G’d being aware that this amount would&nbsp;suffice for the silver needed in connection with the&nbsp;Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את אדני הקודש ואת אדני הפרוכת</span><span class="font5">, “for the sockets of&nbsp;the Sanctuary (planks), and the sockets of the dividing&nbsp;curtain(s).” There were a total of 100 such sockets, 48 for the&nbsp;planks, requiring 96 sockets and 4 for the pillars supporting&nbsp;the dividing curtain, making a total of 100.</span></p><h1 dir="rtl"><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונחושת התנופה שבעים ככר ואלפים וארבע מאות שקל .38,29</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">“and the copper used for the wave offering was seventy talents plus 2400 shekels. Our author translates this into&nbsp;denominations of coins used in France in his time. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">38,30. ויעש בה</span><span class="font5">, “he made of it, etc;” the word בה is used&nbsp;here instead of the word ממנה, which we might have&nbsp;expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אדני פתח אהל מועד, </span><span class="font5">“the sockets of the pillars supporting the curtain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sixty five talents of copper were used for constructing sockets. They were needed for each side of the courtyard&nbsp;around the Tabernacle, one talent for each socket. From the&nbsp;five talents plus remaining, they made the cover for the&nbsp;copper altar, as well as its appurtenances and the clasps&nbsp;needed to hold together the curtains used for the roof which&nbsp;had loops accommodating these clasps. They also made&nbsp;copper hammers to drive into the ground the pegs needed to&nbsp;hold down the edges of the curtains above the Tabernacle&nbsp;which straddled the ground, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has explained at the&nbsp;end of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat T’rumah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do not have to wonder how they had copper left over for the construction of the laver and its stand. Seeing&nbsp;that the materials for those items had been donated by the&nbsp;women, i.e. their mirrors, they are not counted separately as&nbsp;donations of copper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one should think that only the amounts mentioned here were donated by the people. Much more was donated.&nbsp;The Torah only accounts for the amounts which were </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">used&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">directly in the construction of the Tabernacle. The excess of&nbsp;the donations became part of the Temple treasury, and was&nbsp;used for all manner of communal needs. Just as the number&nbsp;600000, that the Torah included in the census did not include&nbsp;the people who had not yet reached the age of twenty or the&nbsp;ones who were past the age of sixty, and all the women, so&nbsp;that most likely the total number of Israelites at the time&nbsp;exceeded 2-3 million, so it would be foolish to assume that&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> the amounts recorded in our portion were donated.&nbsp;From chapter 35,24, it is clear that anyone who felt inclined&nbsp;to make a donation could do so, and no doubt that included&nbsp;people under the age of twenty and over the age of sixty, and&nbsp;the women. Even the males between twenty and sixty who&nbsp;had to contribute a half shekel, most likely donated in excess&nbsp;of this and not only silver coins. The Torah wrote that there&nbsp;was oversubscription, compare 36,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,1. עשו בגדי שרד</span><span class="font5">, “they made into sacramental vestments.” Each garment was composed of a different kind&nbsp;of fabric. How did this work out? All the coverings needed to&nbsp;transport the Tabernacle’s furnishings in, such as the&nbsp;candlestick, the table, the golden altar, the laver, etc., were&nbsp;made totally of blue wool, תכלת. For instance, the coverings&nbsp;for the copper altar were made of red wool, (Numbers 4,13),&nbsp;and the covers for the Table and the showbreads were made&nbsp;of purple coloured wool, (Numbers 4,8). All the details have&nbsp;been spelled out in the Book of Numbers chapter 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,6. ויעשו את אבני השהם</span><span class="font5">, “they “made,” i.e. arranged the onyx stones;” the root עשה is also used in this sense&nbsp;elsewhere, as in Genesis 18,7: וימהר </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">לעשות</span><span class="font5"> אותו, “he&nbsp;hastened to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">prepare</span><span class="font5"> it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,16. על שני קצות החשן</span><span class="font5">, “at the two ends of the breastplate.” Here the Torah used the preposition: על&nbsp;whereas in Exodus 28,24, it used the preposition: אל.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,21. ולא יזה החשן</span><span class="font5">, “so that the breastplate would not come loose;” this is a present tense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,28. פארי המגבעות</span><span class="font5">, “the decorated turbans;” Rav Hai gaon explains that the word means something that looks like&nbsp;a button on top of the headgear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,32. ותכל כל עבודת</span><span class="font5">, “thus was completed all the work;” according to our sages the work was completed on the 25th&nbsp;day in the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kislev,</span><span class="font5"> the day we commence to&nbsp;celebrate the festival of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Chanukkah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,37. את המנורה הטהורה</span><span class="font5">, “the candlestick, the pure one.” The reason why the Torah added the adjective “the pure&nbsp;one,” is because no sacrificial blood was ever sprinkled on&nbsp;the candlestick so that it remained ritually pure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נרות המערכה</span><span class="font5">, “the lamps in its proper order;” the expression מערכה or its equivalent יערוך, “he would do so in&nbsp;proper order,” first occurred in Exodus 27,21 where the&nbsp;functions of the priests are discussed. Alternately, it may&nbsp;allude to the showbreads which were arranged in order on&nbsp;the table and illuminated by the lamps of the candlestick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,40. את מיתריו ויתדותיה</span><span class="font5">, “its cords and its pegs;” compare a similar mixture of masculine and feminine in&nbsp;35,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">39,42. כן עשו בני ישראל את כל העבודה</span><span class="font5">, “so the Israelites had done all the work;” the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah folio</span><span class="font5"> 9&nbsp;states that as soon as Solomon’s temple was completed the&nbsp;Tabernacle and all its appurtenances were hidden. To the&nbsp;question where it was hidden, the Talmud replied that it was&nbsp;“stored” beneath the cavities of the Sanctuary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40,3. וסכות על הארון</span><span class="font5">, ”screen off the Ark with a curtain!” the word וסכות is derived from מסוכה, a separating screen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find it used in that sense in Hoseah 2,8: הנני סך את דרכך, “I will block your path with thorns.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על הארון</span><span class="font5">, “next to the Ark.” The word על is used in this sense also in Leviticus 25,31: על שדה הארץ יחשב, “they (the&nbsp;house not walled in) will be considered as belonging to the&nbsp;adjoining earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על הארון</span><span class="font5">, a similar construction to: על הגמלים, beside the camels in Genesis 24,30, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על המערכת</span><span class="font5">, “next to the row.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40,17. ויהי בחדש הראשון בשנה השנית</span><span class="font5">, “it was on the first day of the second year, counting from the Exodus from&nbsp;Egypt; normally years are counted as commencing with the&nbsp;month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40,35. ולא יכול משה לבא אל אהל מועד</span><span class="font5">, “and Moses was&nbsp;unable to enter the Tent of Meeting,” at the time he had&nbsp;erected it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי שכן עליו הענן</span><span class="font5">, “for the cloud of glory of G’d rested above it;” it did so immediately, to demonstrate G’d’s&nbsp;fondness of the Jewish people. Subsequently, the cloud&nbsp;moved from being above the Sanctuary and took up its&nbsp;position above the Holy Ark which stood in the Holy of&nbsp;Holies. We know this from Exodus 25,22, where the Torah&nbsp;wrote: ונועדתי לך שם ודברתי אתך מעל הכפורת, “I will meet with you&nbsp;there and I will impart to you-from above the cover of the&nbsp;Ark.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Then Moses could enter the Sanctuary;” this is what is meant when the Torah wrote: 'ובבא משה אל אהל מועד וגו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“and&nbsp;when Moses used to enter the Tent of Meeting;” (Numbers&nbsp;7,89). When Solomon consecrated his Temple something&nbsp;similar occurred as reported in Kings I 8,10-11. The priests&nbsp;were not able to enter and perform their duties as long as&nbsp;G’d’s cloud was hovering above the Sanctuary.&nbsp;Subsequently, that cloud was visible only above the Holy of&nbsp;Holies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">40,39. לעיני כל בית ישראל בכל מטעיהם</span><span class="font5">, “in view of all the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Children of Israel during all their journeys.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the meaning of this line is that while the Israelites&nbsp;were encamped as opposed to when they were journeying.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Vayikra</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,1. ויקרא אל משה</span><span class="font5">, “He called out to Moses;” seeing that the Torah had concluded the end of the Book of Exodus with&nbsp;the words: ‘the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle so that&nbsp;Moses was unable to enter the Sanctuary,” it was necessary&nbsp;to let us know now that He called out to him, i.e. gave him&nbsp;permission to enter the Sanctuary. In order to make this clear&nbsp;to the reader, the Torah, instead of writing: “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">the Lord</span><span class="font5"> called&nbsp;out to Moses,” omitted to tell us who it was that called out to&nbsp;him, so that the reader will know that this is not really a new&nbsp;paragraph but a continuation of what had been told us at the&nbsp;end of the Book of Exodus. In other words, we need to&nbsp;understand this opening line of the Book of Leviticus as&nbsp;follows: “the glory of the Lord which had been reported at the&nbsp;end of the Book of Exodus as filling the Tabernacle, now&nbsp;spoke to Moses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is also how the Jerusalem Targum translates this verse. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> on our verse page 235,&nbsp;where the full text of the Jerusalem Targum appears, in&nbsp;Aramaic, of course)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once Moses had entered the Sanctuary, he heard G’d’s voice emanating from between the two cherubs on top of the&nbsp;lid of the Holy Ark as reported in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat</span><span class="font5"> Nasso, 7,89.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אליו</span><span class="font5">, “to him.” On this word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that we might have thought that people outside had heard G’d’s voice&nbsp;speaking to Moses; in order to disabuse us of this, the Torah&nbsp;emphasized: אליו, “to him,” i.e. audible </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> to Moses. The&nbsp;point is made once more in the Book of Numbers 7,89,&nbsp;where the Torah writes that Moses heard the voice of the&nbsp;Lord talking </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to him, </span><span class="font5">מדבר אליו, followed by וידבר אליו. Instead&nbsp;of writing מדבר לו, the word אליו stresses the exclusivity of that&nbsp;voice, i.e. audible only to Moses. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> stresses this also in&nbsp;his commentary on the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאמור</span><span class="font5">, “saying” [in order to relay to the Israelites. Ed.] The author refers the reader to his commentary on Genesis&nbsp;8,15 on the word: לאמור, where </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5"> is given as the&nbsp;source of this interpretation of this word. A well known&nbsp;example of the meaning of this kind of repetition is found in&nbsp;verse 2 of our chapter: דבר אל בני ישראל ואמרת אליהם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“speak to&nbsp;the Children of Israel and say to them;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,2. אדם</span><span class="font5">, “anyone;” this ambiguous description is intended to convey that what follows applies not only also to&nbsp;converts to Judaism, but even to people who are gentiles,&nbsp;although in this paragraph only Israelites are addressed. The&nbsp;exclusive meaning of the word: אדם, here is made plain when&nbsp;the Torah adds the restrictive word: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">מכם</span><span class="font5">, “from amongst you.”&nbsp;This means that what follows applies only to members of the&nbsp;Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, seeing that we have a rule that “whenever the Torah writes two successive restrictive clauses, this is meant&nbsp;to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">include</span><span class="font5"> someone or something, not to exclude it,” the&nbsp;sages understood our verse as the Torah including even&nbsp;gentiles, as qualified to offer sacrifices to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. using&nbsp;the facilities offered by the priests, but </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">paying</span><span class="font5"> for the animals&nbsp;they authorize to be offered on their behalf. (Talmud, tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nazir,</span><span class="font5"> folio 62) This is based also on when the Torah writes:&nbsp;איש, איש, i.e. “any man,” including idolaters, who vow to offer&nbsp;a sacrifice to the G’d of the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יקריב</span><span class="font5">, “who brings” (close); the word introduces the manner in which G’d wishes to be served now that He has&nbsp;taken up residence among His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מכם</span><span class="font5">, “from amongst you.” The prefix letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מ </span><span class="font5">reminds us that not ail of us are addressed here. On the one hand, even&nbsp;absolute gentile idolaters are welcome to present an offering&nbsp;to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> which will be burnt up on the altar in the Temple,&nbsp;as we do not wish to alienate gentiles that are seeking for a&nbsp;religion of truth. On the other hand, by the same token,&nbsp;Jewish renegades who wish to offer such sacrifices in the&nbsp;Temple are rebuffed by the Torah, as what they do would be&nbsp;akin to blasphemy, seeing they demonstrate by their daily&nbsp;conduct that they do not believe in the power of our G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אדם כי יקריב מכם</span><span class="font5">, the verse has been inverted, it’s meaning is as if it had read: אדם מכם כי יקריב, “when someone&nbsp;amongst you wishes to draw close to G’d;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יקריב</span><span class="font5">, same as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יקדיש, </span><span class="font5">“who wishes to sanctify.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'קרבן לה, </span><span class="font5">a sacrifice in honour of the Lord. This is a heading, followed by specifics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן הבהמה, מן הבקר ומן הצאן</span><span class="font5">, “from a category of domestic beasts, it must be either from cattle or flocks.” These are the&nbsp;details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תקריבו את קרבנכם, </span><span class="font5">“you may offer your sacrifice.” The generalization has been repeated once more, i.e. “your&nbsp;sacrifice.” It teaches us that as a rule the details spelled out&nbsp;after a general statement has been made, do not contain&nbsp;surprises, i.e. no matters that could not have been&nbsp;understood as included in the general statement already. In&nbsp;our case, we find that no free roaming beasts are included as&nbsp;potential sacrifices, even though such beasts may qualify to&nbsp;be eaten, such as deer, for instance. Our sages see in this&nbsp;another example of G’d’s “humility;” He does not ask us to do&nbsp;things which are too difficult, such as hunting deer in order to&nbsp;offer them as sacrifices, even though King Solomon had a&nbsp;stable of them and offered such delicacies as venison to his&nbsp;guests. He only asks for animals that are within the average&nbsp;person’s ability to obtain. This is what the prophet&nbsp;(Michah,6,3) referred to when he said, quoting G’d: עמי מה&nbsp;הלאיתיך ענה בי?, “in which way did I inconvenience you My&nbsp;people? Testify against me!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: I only ask you to offer Me </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">animals</span><span class="font5"> as sacrifices, not human beings!” The Canaanites&nbsp;were in the habit at that time to offer some of their own&nbsp;children as sacrifices to their deities. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Midrash Tanchuma on&nbsp;Bechukotai,</span><span class="font5"> 5; compare also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah shleymah</span><span class="font5"> item 56 on our&nbsp;verse, (who points out that Yiftach could have saved the life&nbsp;of his daughter had he made such a stipulation).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,3. אם עולה קרבנו, </span><span class="font5">“if his offering consists of an animal to&nbsp;be burned up completely,” (the priests not eating any parts of&nbsp;it). What is meant is that the donor had stipulated this prior to&nbsp;handing the animal to the priest to slaughter on his behalf.&nbsp;The reason why the burnt offering is the first example of&nbsp;animal offerings mentioned in the Torah is that it is the type&nbsp;of offering most welcomed by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יקריבנו</span><span class="font5">, “he will be able to offer it,” </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> the building of the Tabernacle has been completed; the owner must first&nbsp;sanctify it, i.e. add when handing over the sacrificial animal:&nbsp;“this I have vowed to offer as a burnt offering for the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל פתח אהל מועד, </span><span class="font5">at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting;” the Torah stresses this as the donor is not allowed to invite&nbsp;the officiating priest to come to his home and slaughter the&nbsp;beast in question in the donor’s or the priest’s yard, and&nbsp;perform the rituals connected with it. This would be&nbsp;disrespectful to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> .Imagine a donor of a gift to a mortal&nbsp;king inviting the King to come and pick it up at the donor’s&nbsp;home!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לרצונו</span><span class="font5">, “in order to find favour in His eyes.” The reason is that this is a voluntary offering, not a thanksgiving offering or&nbsp;a guilt or sin offering, all of which are mandatory offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “in the presence of the Lord.” Even though the donor may not enter the sacred precincts of the Temple, his&nbsp;gift is described as “in the presence of the Lord,“ seeing it is&nbsp;not his personal fault that he could not enter these precincts.&nbsp;According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra,</span><span class="font5"> after having placed his hands on the&nbsp;sacrificial animal outside those precincts, he is allowed to do&nbsp;this once more inside the sacred precincts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,4. וסמך ידו, </span><span class="font5">according to the plain meaning of the text,&nbsp;[this is not a commandment but the Torah describes the&nbsp;norm when people offer such an animal. It describes a&nbsp;preparatory activity, Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ידו</span><span class="font5">, this does not have to refer to a single hand, but the verse excludes a son or servant performing this procedure.&nbsp;The Torah does not allow the donor to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">delegate</span><span class="font5"> these acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ידו על ראש</span><span class="font5">, “his hand on the head;” not one hand above the other, or placing his hands on any other part of the&nbsp;animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על ראש העולה</span><span class="font5">, “on the head of the burnt offering;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">understands this as referring to when this burnt offering is a&nbsp;mandatory as distinct from a voluntary burnt offering. He&nbsp;quotes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat Kohanim</span><span class="font5"> in support of his interpretation. It is&nbsp;stated there that if a voluntary burnt offering requires the&nbsp;above procedure as introductory step, then it is obvious that&nbsp;a mandatory burnt offering does not require less. The fact&nbsp;that the Torah writes simply: עולה, without specifying which&nbsp;type of עולה, the voluntary one or the mandatory one, is taken&nbsp;as proof that this placing of the owner’s hands on the head of&nbsp;the animal refers to both types. It also means that regardless&nbsp;of whether the animal is a sheep, or a bull, the same rule&nbsp;applies. On the other hand, only burnt offerings belonging to&nbsp;an individual require this procedure, not animals representing&nbsp;a group of people. Animals belonging to women or to gentiles&nbsp;do not require this procedure either. All of them require an&nbsp;accompanying libation, however, even animals belonging to&nbsp;gentiles. We know this from a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">baraitah</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot</span><span class="font5"> 29,&nbsp;commencing with the words; “when a gentile has sent his&nbsp;burnt offering, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכפר עליו</span><span class="font5">, “to serve as his atonement.” The use of the word: עליו in this sense is also found in Psalms 44,23, עליך,&nbsp;where it clearly means: “for your sake.” The same is true of&nbsp;Psalms 69,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,5. וסמך ושחט, </span><span class="font5">“he will place his hands and slaughter;”&nbsp;up until this point the owners, not being priests, are basically&nbsp;permitted to perform these procedures, provided that they&nbsp;are ritually clean; from this point on the commandment&nbsp;applies only to the priests. The reason the two words are&nbsp;followed in both instances with the words: “in the presence of&nbsp;the Lord,” is that both procedures are carried out at the same&nbsp;location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את ב! </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">הבקר</span><span class="font5">, this term describes the animal as being in its youth, not diseased, in accordance with the maxim&nbsp;expressed in Maleachi 1,8: הקריבהו לפחתך, “would you offer&nbsp;such (diseased animal) to your Governor?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'את בן הבקר לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “the bullock before the Lord;” the one who slaughters it should be doing so in the name of the Lord,&nbsp;even if he has a long knife and himself stands outside&nbsp;consecrated earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shimon the Yemenite, disagreeing and understanding the words “before the Lord,” has been quoted as saying:&nbsp;whence do I derive the rule that the hand of the slaughterer&nbsp;should be </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">within</span><span class="font5"> the foreleg of the animal being slaughtered,&nbsp;i.e. while he is on consecrated ground? You must read the&nbsp;words: 'את בן הבקר לפני ה, as one phrase (without comma) [not&nbsp;supported by the cantillation marks. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בני אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “the sons of Aaron.” To exclude elderly priests whose hands might tremble. Our sages in the Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 24 stated that the age or appearance of&nbsp;age, when a priest becomes disqualified from slaughtering is&nbsp;when his hands begin to tremble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אהרן</span><span class="font5">, who, age notwithstanding [he was 85 at this time, Ed.] was still without physical blemish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כהנים</span><span class="font5">, the priests, who had not forfeited their status due to having committed acts that would disqualify them,&nbsp;from Temple service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והפשיט את העולה</span><span class="font5">, “he shall flay the burnt offering;”&nbsp;seeing that in the case of rams and bulls that needed to be&nbsp;burnt completely, the skin had to be removed first at any rate&nbsp;as it would be given to the officiating priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Afterwards</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font5">their entrails and dung, the Torah had to state that the burnt offerings were to be flayed before&nbsp;being cut up into pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עצים על האש</span><span class="font5">, “wood (in order) on the fire.” The fire&nbsp;had to be placed there first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וערכו בני אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “and Aaron’s sons shall arrange” on&nbsp;the pieces of the burnt offering;” seeing that it is of the&nbsp;category of cattle, big animals, the Torah uses the plural&nbsp;mode whereas with sheep or goats the Torah uses the&nbsp;singular mode for this procedure. (compare verse12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.9. וקרבו וכרעיו ירחץ, “</span><span class="font5">but its innards and its legs he shall wash;” seeing these parts are being served at the&nbsp;“King’s” table, they had to be prepared as if being served at&nbsp;the table of a mortal king. The animals that were going to be&nbsp;burned without having had their skin flayed were not treated&nbsp;in the same fashion as they represented reminders of the&nbsp;donor’s sins, not his desire to “donate” something to his G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ירחץ במים</span><span class="font5">, “he will wash with water;” the translation (in Aramaic) of washing of human beings is יסחי, as it always&nbsp;refers to the immersion of the whole body in a ritual bath. As&nbsp;for instance in Isaiah 25,11: כאשר יפרש השוחה לשחות, “as the&nbsp;swimmer who spreads out his hands in order to swim.” The&nbsp;“washing” of which the Torah speaks in connection with the&nbsp;sacrificial animals is rendered as יחליל, by the Targum. The&nbsp;meaning of that word is more the flushing out of excrements,&nbsp;etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ירחץ במים</span><span class="font5">, I might have thought that the quantity of water required is like in the case of a ritual bath, a minimum of 40&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">saah;</span><span class="font5"> therefore the Torah writes במים to indicate that it does&nbsp;not stipulate a minimum amount of water, i.e. any amount of&nbsp;water is sufficient if it accomplishes its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את הכל</span><span class="font5">, “everything;” this includes bones sinews, horns, and hooves, wool of the head of the sheep and the beard of&nbsp;the goats, as long as they are still attached to their bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.10. ואם מן הצאן קרבנו</span><span class="font5">, “and if the donor chose to offer an animal from his herd;” the following rules do not apply to&nbsp;animals stolen by the donor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן הכבשים או מן העזים</span><span class="font5">, “either from his sheep or his goats;” according to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5"> this excludes animals born from&nbsp;crossbreeding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ושחט אותו וגו</span><span class="font5">, “he is to slaughter it, etc.;” the word&nbsp;אותו implies that the animal which is a burnt offering is to be&nbsp;slaughtered on the northern side of the altar, whereas&nbsp;offerings such as peace offerings, or bird offerings or&nbsp;firstborn animals, tithed animals, and the Passover, cannot&nbsp;be slaughtered on the north side of the altar. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Menachot</span><span class="font5"> 56)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על ירך המזבח</span><span class="font5">, near the side of the altar; the word: על is to be understood as in Exoduss 40,3: וסכות על הארון, “you will&nbsp;use it as a screen (next to it) for the Holy Ark.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ירך המזבח צפונה</span><span class="font5">, “the side of the altar must be to the north of it, in other words: the front of the altar is to the south of it.&nbsp;This teaches that the ramp leading up to the altar was on the&nbsp;south side of the Tabernacle. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zevachim</span><span class="font5"> 62)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'צפונה לפני ה, </span><span class="font5">the northern side of the Tabernacle did not have any part of the altar facing it. This rule also applied to&nbsp;the burnt offering of the species of cattle, as the expression:&nbsp;'לפני ה, is used there also. If the priest had slaughtered that&nbsp;animal on the south side of the altar, this could not properly&nbsp;be described as “facing the Lord,” as no part of the southern&nbsp;part the altar faced the Tabernacle. [only the ramp leading up&nbsp;to it. Ed.] Seeing that the northern part of the Tabernacle was&nbsp;not impeded by priests walking by there, it could be&nbsp;described as פנוי, “always exposed to view.” When&nbsp;slaughtering animals which required to be done on the north&nbsp;side of the altar, this part of the altar faced the Holy of Holies,&nbsp;or 'לפני ה. [The length of the ramp alone proceeding from the&nbsp;southern side of the Tabernacle, was 32 cubits before it&nbsp;reached the altar itself. Ed.] This is based on the Torah&nbsp;having written: במקום אשר תשחט העולה תשחט את החטאת, “&nbsp;(Leviticus 6,18) It is also written: כי כחטאת האשם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“for the sin&nbsp;offering is treated like the guilt offering.” (Leviticus 14,13.)&nbsp;The principal purpose of these sacrifices was for the sake of&nbsp;heaven. On the other hand, sacrifices known under the&nbsp;heading of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kodoshim kalim,</span><span class="font5"> sacred gifts of a lower level of&nbsp;holiness, the Torah did not specify the exact location where&nbsp;these had to be slaughtered. [These included thanksgiving&nbsp;offerings, the Passover lamb, the ram offered by a Nazarene&nbsp;at the conclusion of his term, peace offerings, firstling&nbsp;animals etc. The reason is that the greater part of the offering&nbsp;was consumed by the donor and the priests. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתח אותו</span><span class="font5">, “after it has been cut up;” This had to be&nbsp;stated explicitly in order that we do not think that only the&nbsp;large animals, i.e. bullocks, require to be cut up. No mention&nbsp;is made of these animals being flayed, as it was taken for&nbsp;granted by the Torah that the reader understands this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והקריב הכהן את הכל</span><span class="font5">, “the priest is to offer up the&nbsp;whole;” the phrase refers to the priest carrying all the various&nbsp;pieces to be burned up on the ramp to the altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם מן העוף</span><span class="font5">, if the offering consists of a bird or&nbsp;birds; the word מן “from,” here means that parts of a bird are&nbsp;offered up. If the bird in question is missing one of its limbs it&nbsp;is not fit to be offered up as a sacrifice. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">העוף עולה</span><span class="font5">, a bird does not qualify as a peace offering, i.e. a creature which is partially consumed by the donor or&nbsp;the priest. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">העוף עולה קרבנו</span><span class="font5">, the personal pronoun at the end of the word קרבנו, “his,” teaches that birds may only be offered by&nbsp;individuals, not by a group of individuals. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והקריב</span><span class="font5">, “then he shall bring;” the connective letter ו at the beginning of this word indicates that the Torah speaks of&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">two</span><span class="font5"> people having shared in paying for this offering. [Two&nbsp;partners are not considered a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">group</span><span class="font5"> which the Torah had&nbsp;stated as unable to share in the cost of one bird. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן התורים</span><span class="font5">, “from the turtledoves;” even if these have already fully matured. The reason that the Torah uses the&nbsp;word התורים in the plural mode, is that when the mate of one&nbsp;of the turtledoves has died, the surviving dove is not suitable&nbsp;as a sacrifice anymore as it will not mate with another dove&nbsp;of the gender to the dead dove. (Talmud tractate Eyruvin,&nbsp;folio 100)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או מבני היונה</span><span class="font5">, “or from immature pigeons.” Seeing that a fully mature pigeon is gullible, it does not have a “heart” so&nbsp;that if its mate dies it does not mind mating with another&nbsp;member of its species. Hence the Torah permits only very&nbsp;young pigeons to be offered as a sacrifice. Seeing that these&nbsp;two categories of birds are more persecuted than any other&nbsp;creature, G’d selected them to serve as sacrifices on behalf&nbsp;of man. (Compare Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Kamma,</span><span class="font5"> folio 93.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,15. ומלק</span><span class="font5">, “and he will pinch off;” the priest himself, i.e.&nbsp;with his own hands, on the top of the altar; he was not to use&nbsp;a tool such as a knife. This is in consonance with the&nbsp;commandment that in building the altar, no iron tool, sword,&nbsp;knife, was to be used, as the altar is designed to prolong&nbsp;man’s life, whereas the knife or sword is used to shorten&nbsp;man’s life. [What makes sense when building an altar makes&nbsp;even better sense in the procedures to be performed on the&nbsp;altar. Ed.] Just as the act of pinching mentioned in chapter</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">5,8, was performed at the neck, so here too the Torah refers&nbsp;to the bird’s neck being pinched off. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra</span><span class="font5"> there) The head is&nbsp;not to be completely severed, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראשו והקטיר</span><span class="font5">, just as find that the delivering the head to be burned on the altar was performed by the priest’s hands,&nbsp;no other instrument or container, and the bird’s body was&nbsp;placed on the altar by the priest’s hands, so the&nbsp;“slaughtering” of the two vital tubes that lead to the head was&nbsp;also performed by the priest’s hands. This had to be done in&nbsp;this way in order to prevent the head being accidentally&nbsp;severed from its body by a knife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונמצה דמו</span><span class="font5">, “and its blood shall be drained;” all of its blood. How could this be accomplished? The priest would&nbsp;hold the bird’s body by it skin to ensure it would not be cut in&nbsp;half completely; in this way the blood would seep out from&nbsp;either side of where the priest held the skin in his hands. We&nbsp;have a tradition that anything that disqualifies a four legged&nbsp;animal from becoming an acceptable sacrifice, does so also&nbsp;if its counterpart on the bird is defective, i.e. improperly&nbsp;treated by the priest. On the other hand, anything that does&nbsp;not invalidate the sacrifice of a four-legged animal, for&nbsp;instance the skin, does not invalidate the bird offering either if&nbsp;it had been treated incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונמצה דמו על קיר המזבח</span><span class="font5">, “and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar.” Seeing that if this&nbsp;procedure would be performed by the priest holding a bowl,&nbsp;the amount of blood secured would be minimal, there would&nbsp;not be enough to pick it out of that bowl and to perform the&nbsp;sprinkling of the blood on the top of the altar, the Torah&nbsp;decreed the method described. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל מקום הדשן</span><span class="font5">, “in the place for the ashes.”&nbsp;Chanina, son of Antignos, says </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span><span class="font5"> that there were two&nbsp;such locations. The first one was situated east of the ramp&nbsp;leading to the altar, and the second one was situated east of&nbsp;the altar itself. The one that was located east of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ramp&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">was used for the remainders of the bird offerings, as well as&nbsp;the ashes of the altar inside the Sanctuary, and the ashes&nbsp;from the candlestick, whereas the one east of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">altar</span><span class="font5"> was&nbsp;used for ashes that originated from the burning of the&nbsp;remains of sacrificial animals that had become disqualified by&nbsp;a faulty procedure, or because the owners had not eaten all&nbsp;of their parts in the time allocated for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא יבדיל</span><span class="font5">, “he must not completely detach the&nbsp;wings;” the reason is that the bird is so small anyways; if he&nbsp;were to detach all of its parts, head and wings there would&nbsp;not be much left of it, if he were to offer it as a gift to a mortal&nbsp;king. Hence it is not appropriate to do so with a gift to the&nbsp;King of Kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונפש כי תקריב</span><span class="font5">, “an individual brings the so-called “gift&nbsp;offering,” “מנחה,” a meal offering, as a voluntary offering. This&nbsp;applies even to the High Priest. This type of offering is never&nbsp;presented by a group of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מנחה</span><span class="font5">, another word for “gift.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והביאה</span><span class="font5">, both the letters ו and ה have the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">under them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל בני אהרן, </span><span class="font5">“to the priests;” they brought into the foyer, עזרה of the Sanctuary. [This expression is not used with the&nbsp;Tabernacle except possibly with the Tabernacle in Shiloh,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">where Channah is reported as having offered a silent prayer. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that the woman offering that meal offering brings fine flour to the Temple, and this flour had not&nbsp;previously undergone the procedures necessary for an&nbsp;offering on the altar, she does not need to bring it to the altar&nbsp;as it is clear that her intention is to do this for the sake of&nbsp;heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, the kind of meal offerings that are brought already baked, regardless of in which type of pans, require to&nbsp;be brought to the altar, in order to make plain to all that she&nbsp;had only baked these cakes for the sake of their being&nbsp;consumed on the altar not for secular consumption. She&nbsp;must not be viewed by onlookers as someone who first&nbsp;prepared a meal for herself, and then invited others to share&nbsp;it with her, or to send portions of these cakes to her friends&nbsp;while retaining the lion’s share for herself. This would not be&nbsp;viewed as honouring heaven. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וקמץ משם</span><span class="font5">, “and he (the priest) shall take from that flour a handful; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on the words מלא קומצו, which&nbsp;appears to contradict the restrictive expression: וקמץ, the&nbsp;Torah here speaks of the קומץ that we are familiar with from&nbsp;the Hebrew tongue as meaning something hollow. This is&nbsp;based on Samuel II 17,9: נחבא באחת הפחתים, “hidden in one of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">holes</span><span class="font5">, etc. which is rendered by the Targum as </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">קומציא [</span><span class="font5">I&nbsp;have failed to find the word גומא quoted by our author in the&nbsp;text of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> The super commentary on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> by Mizrachi&nbsp;also appears to have had this difficulty Ed]. According to the&nbsp;Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Menachot</span><span class="font5"> 11) describes the priest as making a&nbsp;partial fist of the three middle fingers of his hand and wipes&nbsp;of any excess on either side with the remaining two fingers&nbsp;trapping the fine flour inside the curve of the three middle&nbsp;fingers. It is described as one of the most difficult parts of the&nbsp;priests’ duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מלא קומצו</span><span class="font5">, “his fistful;” [we already explained that this was not a full fist. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,4. חלות מצות בלולות בשמן</span><span class="font5">, “unleavened cakes soaked in oil;” on the other hand, the רקיקי מצות, “unleavened wafers,”&nbsp;mentioned in the same verse were not soaked in oil. The pan&nbsp;in which they had been baked had only been lightly oiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והבאת</span><span class="font5">, “you will bring (offer);” the letter ו at the&nbsp;beginning of the word is a hint at the offering of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;first ripe offering of the barley harvest, (though it is a&nbsp;communal and mandatory offering) Compare also Leviticus&nbsp;23, 10: והבאתם את העומר</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“you are to bring the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והקריבה</span><span class="font5">, “one has to bring it, etc.;” here the emphasis is on the pronoun ה at the end of the word, i.e. “it, but not the&nbsp;libations.” Also the gift offerings of the priest as well as the&nbsp;High Priest and the showbreads, do not require libations, as&nbsp;well as the first ripe wheat offering (communal) do not require&nbsp;libations to accompany it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והרים</span><span class="font5">, “the priest will lift off, etc.” just as this&nbsp;procedure mentioned in chapter 6,8 consists of a fistful of the&nbsp;priest’s three middle fingers, קומץ, so this is also what it&nbsp;means here, though the Torah does not mentions a quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשה ריח ניחוח</span><span class="font5">, “an offering made by fire, of pleasant fragrance, for the Lord.” We find the same expression, i.e. ריח&nbsp;ניחוח in connection with the burnt offerings of birds (Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1,9, and here it is to teach us that the acceptability and its&nbsp;welcome in the eyes of the Lord of an expensive offering or a&nbsp;low cost offering does not depend on the monetary value but&nbsp;on the attitude of the donor who presents it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'תקריבו אום לה</span><span class="font5">, “you are to present it to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">This procedure is performed in the courtyard of the Temple,&nbsp;but the offering does not reach the altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;במלח</span><span class="font5">, “with salt.” Not with salt water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תמלח</span><span class="font5">. In accordance with the details spelled out in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot</span><span class="font5"> folio 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמת עליה לבונה, מנחה היא</span><span class="font5">, “and lay frankincense&nbsp;thereon, it is a gift-offering, מנחה.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מגרשה</span><span class="font5">, “of the groats thereof,” the letter ג has the&nbsp;vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.1</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ואם זבח שלמים</span><span class="font5">, “and if his offering is a peaceoffering;” the word שלמים, here means: תשלומים, “payment for something.” In this instance, the donor is paying a vow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וסמך ידו על ראש קרבנו</span><span class="font5">, “he must place his weight with&nbsp;his hands on the head of his offering.” This rule does not&nbsp;apply if the offering is either a firstborn animal, animal tithes,&nbsp;or the Passover lamb. It also does not apply to this category&nbsp;of offering when it is offered on behalf of the community. The&nbsp;latter do require libation, and heaving and slaughtering,&nbsp;however as stated in Leviticus 23,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'והקריב מזבח השלמים וגו </span><span class="font5">, “he shall present from the&nbsp;peace-offering, etc.,” nothing is mentioned here concerning&nbsp;the washing of the entrails and legs of peace-offerings, the&nbsp;reason being that these continue to belong to the owners of&nbsp;the respective animals, each one of whom will make his own&nbsp;arrangements concerning such procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את החלב</span><span class="font5">, “the fat;” the expression “fat,” is used to describe the best part of something. This is clear from the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum,</span><span class="font5"> rendering the word as תרבא, i.e. a combination of&nbsp;abundance and excellence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,5. על העולה</span><span class="font5">, according to the plain meaning of the text:&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the burnt offering,” as in Exodus 35,22: ויבאו האנשים על&nbsp;הנשים, “the men came </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the women,” or as in Leviticus&nbsp;25,31: על שדה הארץ יחשב</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">it shall be reckoned </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the field of&nbsp;the land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">העולה</span><span class="font5">, “the burnt offering;” the one that has been discussed in detail, the daily communal burnt offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,7. אם כשב</span><span class="font5">, here the Torah includes the Passover offering whose fatty tail is to be treated as are the ones of&nbsp;peace-offerings. The tail of a goat, however was thrown&nbsp;away. This is why in connection with the Passover lamb, i.e.&nbsp;שה, we also find the word: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן הכבשים</span><span class="font5">, “from among the&nbsp;sheep,” which was not really necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,9. חלבו האליה תמימה</span><span class="font5">, “the fat thereof, the fat tail in perfect condition, earlier (verse 3) that tail had simply been&nbsp;part of the parts of the animal to be burned up as חלב, fat&nbsp;parts forbidden to be eaten,” the Rabbis derived this from&nbsp;Leviticus 7, 23: כל חלב שור וכשב ועז לא תאכלו, “you must not eat&nbsp;the fat of any ox, sheep or goat.” This means that the type of&nbsp;fat that sheep, oxen and goats have in common must not be&nbsp;eaten. It therefore exempts the fatty tail of a sheep from this&nbsp;prohibition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,12. ואם עז קרבנו, </span><span class="font5">and if his offering is a female goat;” any paragraph that has appeared in the Torah and whose&nbsp;basic content has been repeated, was repeated in order to&nbsp;add an additional dimension to it. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 3) Seeing that the subject of the fatty tail is not&nbsp;applicable to female goats, the Torah interrupted its&nbsp;sequential report in order to repeat the laws concerning&nbsp;offering a female goat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל חלב לה</span><span class="font5">, “all fat parts are G’d’s.” This is a law&nbsp;applicable at all times. When the Temple stood, i.e.&nbsp;Solomon’s Temple, when these fat parts were burned on the&nbsp;altar, these parts were not allowed to be eaten even by the&nbsp;priests. The Torah added the word: לדורותיכם, “throughout&nbsp;your generations,” to make clear that this prohibition&nbsp;continues in force even after the Temple no longer&nbsp;functioned. Should you think that this prohibition applied only&nbsp;in the Land of Israel, the Torah added the words: בכל&nbsp;מושבותיכם, “wherever you will dwell.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל חלב, </span><span class="font5">“all fat,” [that used to be burned upon the&nbsp;altar Ed.] the reader will take note that wherever the Torah&nbsp;discusses the subject of animal offerings, it repeats its&nbsp;warning that Israelites must not eat either חלב or דם, “such&nbsp;fat, or blood.” We must learn not to assume that seeing that&nbsp;something is fit to be presented to the King of Kings, it must&nbsp;logically also be acceptable to the King’s subjects. However,&nbsp;the Torah prohibits only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">consumption</span><span class="font5"> of these parts of an&nbsp;animal. It does not forbid making other use of it, or even&nbsp;trading in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,2. כי תחטא בשגגה</span><span class="font5">, “if you transgress a law inadvertently; sin offerings as a form of atonement are&nbsp;acceptable only when that sin had not been committed&nbsp;deliberately. Deliberately committed sins cannot be atoned&nbsp;for by that method. [There are some exceptions. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מאחת מהנה</span><span class="font5">, “of one of these;” the first letter מ in this expression is unnecessary, whereas the second letter מ&nbsp;introduces examples. An example of a similar construction is&nbsp;found in Hoseah 4,9: כעם ככהן, “ordinary people (will fare) as&nbsp;well as priests.” Another such construction can be found in&nbsp;Kings II 3,7: כמוני כמוך, כעמי כעמך, כסוסי כסוסיך, “I will do what&nbsp;you do; my troops will be your troops; my horses will be your&nbsp;horses.” A third example of such a construction is found in&nbsp;Psalms 139,12: כחשכה כאורה, “darkness is like light.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,3-4. אם הכהן המשיח יחטא</span><span class="font5">, “if the anointed priest were to commit an inadvertent sin;” because he is the High Priest, his&nbsp;sin offering will reflect this and he will offer a bull instead of a&nbsp;female goat.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יחטא לאשמת העם</span><span class="font5">, “so as to bring guilt on the people;” the High Priest may have given an erroneous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachic</span><span class="font5"> ruling,&nbsp;and the people, by following that ruling, all committed a sin&nbsp;by performing a forbidden act. We know that it was the duty&nbsp;of the people to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">accept</span><span class="font5"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachic</span><span class="font5"> rulings of the High&nbsp;Priest, seeing that the Torah wrote in Deuteronomy 33,10:&nbsp;יורו משפטיך ליעקב, “they (the Levites) are to teach you (the&nbsp;people) your laws.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על חטאתו אשר חטא</span><span class="font5">, “on account of his sin which he has sinned;” the word על occurs in this context also in Leviticus&nbsp;1,4: לכפר עליו, “to make atonement on account of it.” Compare&nbsp;also Psalms 44,23: כי עליך הורגנו כל היום, “for we are being&nbsp;killed on Your account all day long.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'לפני ה, </span><span class="font5">“before the Lord;” i.e. on the north side facing the entrance to the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וסמך את ידו, </span><span class="font5">“and he is to place the weight of his&nbsp;body with his hand;” no heaving or libations are required with&nbsp;this offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.5. ולקח הכהן המשיח מדם הפר</span><span class="font5">, “the High Priest is to take some of the blood of this bull;” the expression לקח both here&nbsp;and again in Exodus 24,6 [in the past tense, i.e. ויקח] teach&nbsp;us that just as in Exodus Moses used a bowl in which the&nbsp;blood was placed, so the High Priest here is also supposed&nbsp;to place that blood in a bowl first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וטבל, והזה</span><span class="font5">, “the priest will dip his finger in the blood,&nbsp;and sprinkle;” every sprinkling of the blood has to be&nbsp;preceded by the priest dipping his finger in the blood;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אצבעו</span><span class="font5">, “his finger”; this finger is mentioned both here and again in Leviticus 14,16. Just as in that verse the right&nbsp;index finger is the one to be used, so here too he is to&nbsp;perform this procedure with the index finger of his right hand.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבע פעמים</span><span class="font5">, “seven times.” He is to count seven times during this procedure, not the way the High Priest does&nbsp;during the sprinkling on the Day of Atonement, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra,</span><span class="font5"> here)&nbsp;where he counted:; “one, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">plus</span><span class="font5"> seven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבע פעמים</span><span class="font5">, seven times.” The number seven occurs on many separate occasions repeatedly in matters involving&nbsp;heaven. There are seven constellations of major stars, we&nbsp;speak of seven layers of the heavens, and the earth,&nbsp;correspondingly, is referred to by seven different names, i.e:&nbsp;,ארץ, אדמה, ארקא, חרבה, יבשה,תבל and חלד</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font5">There are seven&nbsp;deserts mentioned in the Torah; there are seven “worlds,”&nbsp;(i.e. G’d created seven universes, and destroys six of them)&nbsp;compare (Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer) the week has seven days,&nbsp;we count seven years of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> cycle, seven times&nbsp;seven for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jubilee</span><span class="font5"> cycle. The candlestick in the Temple&nbsp;had seven lamps. Bileam, the sorcerer, built seven different&nbsp;altars. (Compare more on this in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avot</span><span class="font5"> de Rabbi Natan,&nbsp;chapter 37.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'על קרנות מזבח הקטורת הסמים לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “on the horns of&nbsp;the altar of sweet fragrances, in front of the Lord.” This does&nbsp;not mean that the priest is standing before the Lord, as he is&nbsp;standing in front of that altar when he sprinkles, and both the&nbsp;altar and the dividing curtain separate him from the Holy Ark&nbsp;in the Holy of Holies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,10. כאשר יורם</span><span class="font5">, “as it is lifted off;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that&nbsp;the Torah had to spell out the “heaving” of the fat pieces of&nbsp;the High Priest’s sin offering in order that we learn from this&nbsp;that the same procedure also had to be performed in the&nbsp;case of the ox that was a peace offering. (Leviticus 3,3-10)&nbsp;Why did also the same procedure have to be spelled out&nbsp;again in verse 20 of our chapter instead of the Torah simply&nbsp;writing: “as in that instance?” What was </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">different</span><span class="font5"> here from&nbsp;there? How could we make a legal comparison that had </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">been spelled out from a verse in which it had itself not been&nbsp;spelled out, i.e. seeing that in verse 20 the Torah only writes:&nbsp;“as he had done, etc.,” without saying </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">what</span><span class="font5"> he had done in&nbsp;that other instance? According to our author rule number&nbsp;three out of 13 rules of how to interpret the written Torah, by&nbsp;Rabbi Yishmael, does not apply when the Torah deals with&nbsp;the subject of קדשים, offerings presented in the sacred&nbsp;precincts of the Temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר יורם משור זבח השלמים</span><span class="font5">, “as it is taken off the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings;” the reason why the Torah used&nbsp;this example to compare this offering to, is to teach that it too&nbsp;is instrumental in restoring peace between Israel and G’d, as&nbsp;opposed to comparing it to peace offerings consisting of&nbsp;sheep, which are communal offerings, as in Leviticus 23,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על ראשו ועל כרעיו</span><span class="font5">, “with its head and its legs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וקרבו ופרשו, </span><span class="font5">“as well as its entrails and its excrement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והוציא את כל הפר</span><span class="font5">, “he is to remove the entire bull,&nbsp;etc.” this teaches that he has to do so before the animal has&nbsp;been cut up into pieces; in other words: the head with the&nbsp;legs need to be cut up of this animal outside the sacred&nbsp;precincts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,22</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר נשיא יחטא</span><span class="font5">, “when the secular head of the nation commits an inadvertent sin;” the construction אשר נשיא&nbsp;יחטא, instead of: נשיא אשר יחטא, also occurs in Esther 6,8:&nbsp;ואשר נתן כתר מלכות על ראשו, where we would have expected&nbsp;the sequence of וכתר מלכות אשר נתן בראשו, “and the crown of&nbsp;the Kingdom which had been placed on his head.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,24. במקום אשר ישחט את העולה, </span><span class="font5">“at the same place as he has to slaughter the burnt-offering.” This was done in order&nbsp;not to embarrass a sinner, so that the people would think he&nbsp;is presenting a burnt offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,25. על קרנות מזבח העולה</span><span class="font5">, “on the horns (corners) of the altar for burnt offerings.” When either the High Priest or the&nbsp;community offers a sacrifice (sin offering), the blood for the&nbsp;atonement through these sacrifices is considered before the&nbsp;Almighty as if it had been offered </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">inside</span><span class="font5"> the Sanctuary and&nbsp;having been sprinkled on the dividing curtain and on the&nbsp;golden altar. By the same token, the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">sins</span><span class="font5"> for which&nbsp;atonement had been sought may be perceived as if they had&nbsp;been cast out even beyond the three Camps of the Israelite&nbsp;nation, all according to the severity of the sin to be atoned&nbsp;for. If either the secular head of the people or another person&nbsp;find themselves in the same position, seeing that they are not&nbsp;so highly ranking individuals do not bother to offer the&nbsp;required sacrifice and do not consider either the blood of it or&nbsp;its entrails etc, the blood of their sacrifices is offered on the&nbsp;altar in the courtyard of the Temple, and the meat of these&nbsp;sacrifices may be consumed. (based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor end of&nbsp;Vayikra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">4.27.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואשם</span><span class="font5">, “and he has become guilty;” he found out&nbsp;himself that he had committed an inadvertent sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;או הודע אליו</span><span class="font5">, “or it had been brought to his&nbsp;attention;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והוא ידע ואשם</span><span class="font5">, “it came to his attention some time&nbsp;after the event so that he </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font5"> had become guilty;” according&nbsp;to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> he had known, but had forgotten that this contact&nbsp;had made him ritually impure, so that he considered himself&nbsp;ritually pure. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> how could he have become&nbsp;guilty since he had not been warned that he had committed&nbsp;something that results in his becoming impure?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לאחת מאלה</span><span class="font5">, “be guilty concerning one of these&nbsp;things.” Concerning this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> asks what the Torah means to&nbsp;tell us with these words? (Actually on verse 13, where the&nbsp;same expression occurs, not on this verse) he answers that&nbsp;the three different sins all involving oaths that are being&nbsp;mentioned here are being treated equally. He answers that I&nbsp;could have thought that the type of offering demanded would&nbsp;be determined by the relative severity of the sin, whereas the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Torah reveals that it is determined by the economic status of the sinner concerned. For example: if the person concerned&nbsp;had by mistake eaten part of an offering, he basically has to&nbsp;atone for this by offering a sheep or female goat. If he had&nbsp;committed a less serious sin, by failing to testify to something&nbsp;he had been a witness of, he has to bring a bird offering. If&nbsp;his inadvertent sin consisted of swearing an oath concerning&nbsp;what he would or would not do, and had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">forgotten</span><span class="font5"> that he&nbsp;had expressed this by words that made it an oath, he will&nbsp;bring a meal offering as atonement consisting of about two&nbsp;kilos of flour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והביא את אשמו</span><span class="font5">, “he shall bring as his guilt offering,&nbsp;etc;” this offering does not have to be accompanied by a&nbsp;libation, but it does require that the person bringing it places&nbsp;his weight through his hands upon it (when confessing his&nbsp;guilt). </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">5.7.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וא</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תגיע ידו</span><span class="font5">, “if he is financially unable, etc.” the&nbsp;Torah does not demand that he must borrow money in order&nbsp;to be able to atone for his unintentional sin, and it does not&nbsp;require that he use the products of his special skill and bring&nbsp;this as an offering. But if he owns a lamb, which is what is&nbsp;basically required of him as an offering, but he does not have&nbsp;money to cover his basic expenses, he </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">does</span><span class="font5"> have to bring&nbsp;this lamb as his offering. The sages derive this rule from the&nbsp;Torah having written: די שה. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra</span><span class="font5"> on that verse)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחד לחטאת ואחד לעולה, </span><span class="font5">“one of which (the two birds) as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.” Only the blood&nbsp;of a bird offering that is a sin offering is brought to the altar,&nbsp;so that the altar has something that can be “eaten.” When a&nbsp;wealthy person has to bring a sin offering, the Torah is&nbsp;satisfied with either a female sheep or goat, seeing that there&nbsp;is enough meat on these animals to provide a meal for the&nbsp;officiating priest, and the entrails provide the ”meal” for the&nbsp;altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,8. והקריב את אשר לחטאת ראשונה</span><span class="font5">, “he (the priest) is to present the offering serving as the sin offering, first;” the&nbsp;verse does not discuss what is offered first on the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">altar</span><span class="font5">, but&nbsp;what is slaughtered (pinched) first. Any left over blood will be&nbsp;squeezed out on the altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יבדיל</span><span class="font5">, “he must not sever the head (of the bird) completely. Only one of the vital conduits of the bird, either&nbsp;the one for breathing, or the one for leading to the stomach&nbsp;needs to be pinched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,9. והנשאר בד</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ימצה</span><span class="font5">, “and the remainder of the blood shall be drained out;” the priest walks around the side of the&nbsp;altar and squeezes the bird against the wall of the altar so&nbsp;that the blood drains by itself. The word is spelled here with&nbsp;the letter א at the end [not in any of the editions of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chumash</span><span class="font5"> or training Torah scrolls at my disposal. According&nbsp;to one commentary I have seen the author had the same&nbsp;spelling in front of him as do we, but he means that the vowel&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzeyre</span><span class="font5"> instead of the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol</span><span class="font5"> the result is that the&nbsp;meaning is as if the letter ה had been written instead of the&nbsp;letter א. Ed.] It suggested that the blood ends up the same&nbsp;way as does the blood which had been sprinkled, namely at&nbsp;the base of the altar. What is left of the bird may be eaten by&nbsp;the officiating priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A commandment performed at its proper time is more welcome to the Lord than at a later time, i.e. the sinner&nbsp;having expected some substantial money coming his way&nbsp;and therefore preferring to wait with the sin offering until he&nbsp;can present an animal of greater worth. The same rule&nbsp;applies to the person who, although not even having sinned,&nbsp;promises his own worth as a donation to G’d shortly before&nbsp;reaching the age of twenty, at which time he must give the&nbsp;Temple treasury 50 shekels in order to discharge his vow as&nbsp;opposed to only 20 shekels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי חטאת היא</span><span class="font5">, “for it really should have had the rules pertaining to a sin offering, requiring libations so that the&nbsp;sinner would not emerge as having actually profited. The&nbsp;reason why the Torah decided to forego this requirement is&nbsp;so that the sinner would not be able to boast about what kind&nbsp;of costly sacrifice he had brought in order to atone for what&nbsp;was, after all, only an inadvertent sin. In the case of someone&nbsp;who offers a sin offering for having been healed from the&nbsp;affliction of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> seeing that [at least according to the&nbsp;written text of the Torah, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He had not been afflicted for a specific sin that he had been guilty of, This offering is required only in order to enable&nbsp;the person offering it to be able to eat of sacrificial meat&nbsp;when the occasion arises. Therefore these offerings require&nbsp;libations, as our sages have stated in the Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,13. והיתה לכהן כמנחה</span><span class="font5">, “and it (the remnant) will belong to the priests, just as a gift-offering. All male priests are&nbsp;allowed to partake of it within the sacred precincts of the&nbsp;Temple only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,15. איל תמי</span><span class="font5">ם, “an unblemished ram, according to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> a two year old ram, fully mature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,19. אש</span><span class="font5">ם, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אש</span><span class="font5">ם, “a guilt offering, he is guilty;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> he has to bring the offering decreed for having&nbsp;sexual relations with a Canaanite servant woman who has&nbsp;not yet </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">completed</span><span class="font5"> the procedure for becoming free; This&nbsp;offering consists if a two year old ram. This is clear, as only&nbsp;after having attained that age is this animal referred to as איל.&nbsp;We might have asked what special “power” does a 2 year old&nbsp;ram possess to have been selected by the Torah as&nbsp;atonement for the sin of treating Temple treasury money as if&nbsp;it were secular money? At that age this animal is valued at&nbsp;two shekels. This is why the Torah repeats the word אשם. We&nbsp;might have thought that a sheep, כבש בן שנתו, one year old,&nbsp;such as is required from someone healed from the affliction&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> would have sufficed. This is to teach us that this is&nbsp;not so, the Torah emphasized: אשם, he is guilty, as opposed&nbsp;to a person afflicted with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> concerning whom no&nbsp;specific guilt has been spelled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the question of how we could have made such a mistake seeing that in the case of the sin offering for a&nbsp;Nazarene or a person afflicted with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> the Torah had&nbsp;spelled out the word כבש, which if not stated otherwise, is a&nbsp;one year old sheep?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is why we need to correct the wording in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi, </span><span class="font5">and add the words “worth two shekels,” an expression not&nbsp;used in the Torah accept in connection with the atonement&nbsp;offering or people guilty of abusing money belonging to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Temple treasury, i.e. the sin of מעילה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">(</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Compare</span><span class="font5"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat Kohanim</span><span class="font5"> on Leviticus 19,11, where this has been spelled out&nbsp;already.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,24. ישבע עליו לשקר ושלם</span><span class="font5">, “about which he has sworn falsely,” the Torah here tells us of the penalty for this sin, but&nbsp;where did the warning not to commit this sin which we&nbsp;expect, appear? Answer: compare Leviticus 19,11: לא תשקרו,&nbsp;“do not lie!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושלם אותו בראשו</span><span class="font5">, “he shall repay the victim in full;” he does not have to pay twice the full amount, as in the case of&nbsp;a thief who has stolen tangible chattels. Neither does he&nbsp;have to repay the victim four or five times the value as in the&nbsp;case of a thief who has destroyed the evidence by selling the&nbsp;stolen goods or consuming them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation of this verse: “he has to repay the stolen object, and in the event that the stolen goods have&nbsp;already passed to other hands so that we cannot determine&nbsp;its value, his sin offering would not be acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחמשיתיו</span><span class="font5">, “plus twice an additional 25%, i.e. 20% when counted </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> adding the full amount of the fine, if he had only&nbsp;owned up to his sin after witnesses have testified to his being&nbsp;guilty</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font5">If he admitted his guilt </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> our having independent&nbsp;proof of it, it suffices if he adds 25% to the value of the goods&nbsp;in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">י</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תננו ביום אשמתו</span><span class="font5">, “the robber has to make restitution on the day when he had been declared guilty, in order for his&nbsp;guilt offering to become acceptable to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או מכל אשר ישבע עליו לשקר</span><span class="font5">, “or from anything concerning which he had sworn falsely;” this additional detail is meant to&nbsp;include תשומת יד</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">intangibles, such as pledges or loans which&nbsp;no longer can be collected from the sinner. It also includes&nbsp;false oaths as witness, or intangible damage caused by a&nbsp;non priest entering sacred precincts, which did not cause&nbsp;measurable damage to the Temple. In some of these&nbsp;examples the sinner did not enjoy a tangible or even&nbsp;intangible profit from having committed this sin. In such&nbsp;instances the Torah took this fact into consideration when&nbsp;assessing the penalty to be applied. This is why financially&nbsp;hard up people, guilty of either of these sins may attain&nbsp;atonement by low cost offerings, depending on how hard up&nbsp;they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason the sages have tagged these sacrifices with the expression: עולה ויורד, “ascending or descending,” is that&nbsp;if a poor man delayed bringing the inexpensive offering he&nbsp;was entitled to due to his economic status, and he became&nbsp;wealthy in the interval, he cannot plead poverty as a reason&nbsp;for offering the low priced offering. On the other hand, if the&nbsp;sinner before having a chance to offer the higher priced&nbsp;offering became impoverished, G’d will accept the offering of&nbsp;a pair of birds instead of a sheep or goat, or in extreme&nbsp;cases even a meal offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If someone ate (inadvertently, of course) forbidden fat from a sacrifice, or he ate any kind of blood, or he ate on the&nbsp;Day of Atonement, or he performed biblically prohibited kind&nbsp;of work on the Sabbath, or he indulged in sexual intercourse&nbsp;forbidden under the heading of “incest,” all sins from which&nbsp;he derived physical pleasure, he must bring the standard&nbsp;type of sacrifice prescribed by the Torah. Someone who ate&nbsp;from sacrificial meat that he was not entitled to eat from has&nbsp;actually enjoyed a dual benefit from his sin, so that he must&nbsp;bring a sin offering worth two shekels. Similarly, if he swore&nbsp;falsely not to have stolen what he has been accused of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If he is guilty of what is called: “a guilt offering valid while we are in doubt if he had committed a sin,” he first has&nbsp;to offer a sacrifice worth two shekels, and if it is eventually&nbsp;determined that he had indeed been guilty of having&nbsp;committed that sin, he offers an additional sacrifice worth one&nbsp;shekel. Although at first glance we may be puzzled by this,&nbsp;the reason is that the only reason why he had not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">known</span><span class="font5"> that&nbsp;he had indeed committed the sin in question, is because he&nbsp;chose to give himself the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">benefit</span><span class="font5"> of the doubt. Next time,&nbsp;hopefully, he will be more careful not to develop such a&nbsp;doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,26. לאשמה בה</span><span class="font5">, “to become guilty thereby.” The only&nbsp;exception to this rule is if the sinfully acquired property is less&nbsp;than the lowest valued coin, called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prutah</span><span class="font5"> (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah&nbsp;sh’leymah</span><span class="font5"> on this item 236 on our verse).</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Tzav</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,2. צו את אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “command Aaron;” whenever the&nbsp;expression </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzav</span><span class="font5"> is used, it is a commandment to be&nbsp;performed with alacrity, without delay, and is meant to apply&nbsp;indefinitely, not only for a limited period, i.e. one time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason we know that it is meant to encourage the person so commanded to fulfill the order without delay, is&nbsp;because the Torah wrote in Deuteronomy 1,16: “I will charge&nbsp;(command) your judges, etc.” In Numbers 5,2 the Torah&nbsp;wrote: (concerning the people afflicted with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;dreaded skin disease, that such people must be removed&nbsp;forthwith from the camp of the Israelites. The Torah there&nbsp;adds, that this order was carried out without delay (Numbers&nbsp;5,4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that this is not a formulation used with commands valid only on a single occasion, is that in&nbsp;Numbers 15,23, the Torah writes concerning a number of&nbsp;commandments that they apply for all future generations for&nbsp;sins committed inadvertently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that such tasks were removing last night’s ash from the altar, or making sure that there was always an&nbsp;adequate supply of wood at hand on the altar, it is human&nbsp;nature not to relate to this with exceptional haste, the Torah,&nbsp;when legislating this command, employed a term implying&nbsp;haste, the need to perform that task without delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> quoting Rabbi Shimon, is on record as saying that all commandments which involve expense to the person&nbsp;commanded to do so need reminders not to delay, as it is&nbsp;only human to seek to delay having to spend one’s money&nbsp;when it is not for making a profit from the transaction. What&nbsp;he means is that if the first person charged with doing&nbsp;something has not performed his task, then another person&nbsp;has to substitute for him, something called חסרון כיס, being&nbsp;out of pocket. In our age the correct term would be: “because&nbsp;time is money.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אהרן</span><span class="font5">, up until now we read about the sons of Aaron having to perform certain chores, as for instance in chapter 1&nbsp;verse 11, and verse 8. At this point, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vayikra&nbsp;rabbah,</span><span class="font5"> Moses turned to G’d and said: “how can a well which&nbsp;is in disgrace produce water that is welcome and pure? What&nbsp;he meant was that if Aaron was in disgrace because of the&nbsp;sin of the golden calf, how could his sons be fit to perform the&nbsp;duties in the Tabernacle? [I find this somewhat difficult to&nbsp;accept as the commands in our chapter were addressed to&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> Aaron, and his sons (6,2). Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have learned in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> 3 of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tamid</span><span class="font5"> at the beginning of chapter 2, that all manner of wood is suitable as&nbsp;firewood for the sacrifices with the exception of olive wood&nbsp;and the wood of grape vines. The reason is that the wood of&nbsp;the olive tree is of a higher status as the oil of the lamps&nbsp;candlestick is made from the olives that grew on an olive&nbsp;tree, and the wine used in libations is used in Temple. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> immediately preceding that one reports the fact that&nbsp;none of the priests charged with removing the ash had ever&nbsp;been late in the performance of his duties. We see that the&nbsp;trunk of the olive tree was honoured on account of its fruit, so&nbsp;that the sons of Aaron should be honoured because of their&nbsp;father. When G’d heard Moses’ reasoning He immediately&nbsp;changed the wording of the commandment by including&nbsp;Aaron in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זאת תורת העולה</span><span class="font5">, “these are the instructions pertaining to offering any burnt offering;” up until now we had not known&nbsp;from which hour in the morning this communal daily sacrifice&nbsp;could be offered. Neither had we known at what hour its&nbsp;counterpart in the evening was to be presented. This is why&nbsp;this verse was preceded by the words: זאת תורת העולה, ”</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font5"> is&nbsp;the instruction concerning </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">the</span><span class="font5"> burnt offering,” i.e. this burnt&nbsp;offering is subject to special rules.

This point is&nbsp;underlined once more when the Torah wrote in Leviticus&nbsp;7,16: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ביום</span><span class="font5"> הקריבו את זבחו, “on the day when he offered his&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">meat</span><span class="font5"> offering, its fat parts and its limbs are permitted for&nbsp;consumption all night long.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">בו, “from it;” the letter ב here is substituting for the letter מ which we would have expected. We find something similar&nbsp;in Exodus 30,26: ומשחת בו את אהל מועד, “you are to anoint&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font5"> it (from the oil of anointing) the Tent of Meeting.” You&nbsp;find this use of the word בו again in verse 13 of our chapter:&nbsp;where the words: ביום המשח אותו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">mean “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font5"> the day he had&nbsp;anointed him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whence do we know that the fire for Aaron’s coal-pan and the fire for kindling the candlestick in the Sanctuary were&nbsp;also taken from the altar for the animal sacrifices? This is&nbsp;simple logic. If the fire for the golden altar had to be provided&nbsp;from the fire on the altar in front of the Tabernacle, the same&nbsp;must be true for the fire of the priest’s coal-pan (for incense)&nbsp;and for lighting the lamps on the candlestick. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,3. מדו בד</span><span class="font5">, “in a garment made of linen;” the letter ו at&nbsp;the end of the word: מדו is superfluous, just as the second&nbsp;letter ו in וחיתו ארץ in Genesis 1,24, and the letter ו in&nbsp;Numbers 24 in the word: .בנו</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מדו בד</span><span class="font5">, these are the cap, tunic, and belt worn by the ordinary priest, all of which are made of linen. The reason&nbsp;that they are all mentioned in the singular mode, is that&nbsp;whenever worn by the priest, all of them are worn&nbsp;simultaneously. The reason why the pants are mentioned&nbsp;separately, as we find already in Exodus 28,42, after the&nbsp;garments worn by the High Priest and the ordinary priests&nbsp;have been listed. The pants are mentioned separately, as&nbsp;both the High Priest and the ordinary priest wear the same&nbsp;kind of pants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat Kohanim, (Sifra</span><span class="font5"> on our verse) this is hinted at in the apparently extraneous word: ילבש, the four&nbsp;letters hinting that the ordinary priests wore four garments&nbsp;when on duty. The repetition both here and Exodus 28 that&nbsp;the pants must be worn on his skin, על בשרו, suggest that&nbsp;these pants must always be also the first garment the priest&nbsp;dons in order to cover his private parts. The plural mode&nbsp;מכנסים is similar to the English language where “pants” or&nbsp;“trousers” are in the plural mode because they refer to a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">single</span><span class="font5"> garment covering both legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על בשרו</span><span class="font5">, a delicate description of the priest’s private parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והרים את הדשן</span><span class="font5">, “he shall lift up the ashes;” the plain meaning of the verse is that in order to remove the ashes the&nbsp;priest must first put on the garments described here. He is&nbsp;not allowed to wear street clothes even for performing this&nbsp;procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את הדשן</span><span class="font5">, “at least a fistful of ashes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והוציא</span><span class="font5">, same as להוציא, “in order to remove the&nbsp;ashes.” The absence of the word “the priest,” here is an&nbsp;indication that even a priest who is disqualified from&nbsp;performing other procedures in the Temple due to physical&nbsp;blemishes, may perform this procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל מקום טהור</span><span class="font5">,”^ a ritually pure location” seeing that these ashes had originated in sacred precincts. This is&nbsp;distinct from the stones of a house whose stones were&nbsp;afflicted with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> which have to be removed to a ritually&nbsp;unclean location, a location which people carrying objects&nbsp;that require ritual purity may not be brought to. (Leviticus&nbsp;14,41)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והאש על המזבח</span><span class="font5">, “and the fire on the altar, etc.;” the&nbsp;Torah reverts now to a statement made by Rabbi Yehudah in&nbsp;the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 45 according to which the wood used&nbsp;for kindling may be burned only on the top part of the altar,&nbsp;i.e. על המזבח. This was used to kindle the major stack of wood&nbsp;that burned around the clock on the altar. (This is the way&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains the word .(אליתא</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וערך עליה</span><span class="font5">, to the question where on the altar all the parts of the burnt offering are to burned up, the Torah answers&nbsp;with the word: עליה; to the question where the relevant parts&nbsp;of the sin offerings and peace offerings are to be burned up,&nbsp;the Torah adds the words: חלבי השלמים, “the best parts of the&nbsp;peace offerings.” [fat parts listed previously, mainly above the&nbsp;kidneys and liver of the animal. Ed.] To the question where&nbsp;the fistful of meal offerings and frankincense, and libations&nbsp;etc. are to be burned up, the Torah answers with the word:&nbsp;והקטיר. To make sure that we do not get the impression that&nbsp;the incense is also to be burned up on the large altar in front&nbsp;of the Temple, the Torah adds: ובער עליה וערך את העצים, “that&nbsp;the priest is to set a special fire on the golden altar where the&nbsp;incense will be burned up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אש תמיד</span><span class="font5">, “a perpetual fire;” it will be kept burning&nbsp;even on the Sabbath, even if for some reason it became&nbsp;ritually impure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תכבה</span><span class="font5">, “where it will not go out.” Even while the Israelites were journeying through the desert, G’d’s honour&nbsp;demanded that precautions be taken that this flame be kept&nbsp;going. According to Rabbi Yehudah in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Sifra.</span><span class="font5"> they used a&nbsp;kind of metal dome fixed above it to insure that it was kept&nbsp;going. [Seeing that the clouds of glory kept the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">people&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">protected from rain, sandstorms and other inclemency of&nbsp;weather, this does not sound so exceptional. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל פני המזבח</span><span class="font5">, “In front of the altar.” There was no&nbsp;need to present it on the altar, as explained already on&nbsp;Leviticus 2,1. (Compare also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והרים ממנו</span><span class="font5">, “he will remove some of it,” (the gift&nbsp;offering) it has been written in the masculine mode (although&nbsp;the word מנחה is feminine) We find a similar grammatically&nbsp;incorrect construction in Leviticus 27,9: כל אשר יתן ממנו לה' יהיה&nbsp;קודש, where according to the grammar the Torah could have&nbsp;been expected to write ממנה instead of ממנו. There are&nbsp;numerous such incongruous constructions in different parts&nbsp;of the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והנותרת ממנה</span><span class="font5">, “and what is left of it;” the Torah here&nbsp;repeats itself seeing that it had written in Leviticus 2,3: that&nbsp;the leftover from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minchah</span><span class="font5"> offering was to be given to&nbsp;Aaron and his sons. If the Torah had not stated this at this&nbsp;point, we might have thought that the entire left over was to&nbsp;be given to be burnt. The word: ממנה from it, makes it clear&nbsp;that this is not so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מצות תאכל</span><span class="font5">, “it must be consumed as unleavened cakes;” seeing that up until now, -i.e. before it had been sanctified- it&nbsp;was permissible to be eaten either leavened or unleavened,-the Torah had to make clear that though it is “leftovers,” it did&nbsp;not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">revert</span><span class="font5"> to its original status. We find something similar in&nbsp;the legislation of the levirate marriage. (Deuteronomy 25,5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah writes that after certain rituals had been observed the brother-in-law of his widowed brother can marry his&nbsp;widow, period. In order to teach us that this is not quite so,&nbsp;the Torah there adds the word: ויבמה, “he performs the&nbsp;levirate marriage ceremony on her.” [This explanation is not&nbsp;found in all versions of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;חלקם נתתי אותה מאשי</span><span class="font5">, “I have given it as their share&nbsp;of My offerings by fire;” The Torah explains here why it must&nbsp;not be baked with leavening, having first been part of the&nbsp;offerings brought to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span><span class="font5"> Of these offerings we had been&nbsp;told in Leviticus 2,11: 'כל שאור וכל דבש לא תקטירו ממנו אשה לה,&nbsp;“you are not to burn up as a fire offering to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> anything&nbsp;leavened or anything containing honey.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קדש קדשים היא</span><span class="font5">, “it is most holy;” it is of the same status as all holy things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כחטאת</span><span class="font5">, “just as the sin offering;” just as the sin offering originally had been secular, i.e. the person presenting it used&nbsp;money to purchase the animal </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font5"> first sanctifying that&nbsp;money. This had to done by day and with the right hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל זכר, </span><span class="font5">“every male; the content of this paragraph&nbsp;had already been written Leviticus 2,10. It was repeated here&nbsp;for three reasons. 1) Unleavened bread had to be eaten on&nbsp;sacred ground. 2) Any male priest could eat it. 3) Anyone or&nbsp;anything coming into contact with it would become out of&nbsp;bounds unless such a person had first ritually purified&nbsp;himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,13. ביום המשח אותו</span><span class="font5">, “on the day when he is anointed;” the prefix letter ב in the word ביום was used here instead of&nbsp;the prefix letter מ, “from.” From that day on the high Priest&nbsp;has to present this daily offering. We find another example of&nbsp;the use of the letter ב in the same sense as here, in chapter&nbsp;7, verse 36: ביום משחו אותם, “from the day they were&nbsp;anointed.” (Ibn Ezra) Also in chapter 8, verse 32, והנותר בבשר&nbsp;ובלחם, the correct translation is: “and that which is left over&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font5"> the meat and the bread.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מחציתם בבקר ומחציתם בערב</span><span class="font5">, “half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.” How is the High Priest to perform&nbsp;the procedure? He brings a whole tenth of an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eyfah</span><span class="font5"> in the&nbsp;morning, and proceeds to divide that quantity in half,&nbsp;proceeding to offer the first half in the morning and the&nbsp;remaining half in the evening. If, in the interval, the half&nbsp;reserved for offering in the evening has becoming ritually&nbsp;contaminated, or has somehow been lost, the priest will bring&nbsp;the full </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eyfah</span><span class="font5"> in the evening to compensate for what was lost&nbsp;or has been contaminated. He will do so by dividing it into&nbsp;two halves, but only offering one of the two halves, so that a&nbsp;whole </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eyfah</span><span class="font5"> will have been offered and a whole </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eyfah</span><span class="font5"> will&nbsp;have been lost. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,14. תעשה מרבכת, “</span><span class="font5">it will be presented after having been prepared with oil on a griddle.” The only time in the&nbsp;Torah that we hear about such a procedure, is here and in&nbsp;connection with the קרבן תודה, mandatory thanksgiving&nbsp;offering, and during the consecration rites of the priests when&nbsp;the Tabernacle was consecrated. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Menachot</span><span class="font5"> 78)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תפיני</span><span class="font5">, “in broken pieces;” the expression means that it has not been baked thoroughly, and is neither raw nor&nbsp;cooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,16. כליל תהיה</span><span class="font5">, “it shall be offered whole.” Seeing that&nbsp;no one will eat part of it, how miserly would it be if he only&nbsp;offered part of a fistful, קומץ to the Lord, as is done with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minchah</span><span class="font5"> offering of the ordinary Israelites, of which only this&nbsp;partial fistful will be burnt up symbolically</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">the remainder&nbsp;being eaten by the priests in their capacity of servants of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem?</span><span class="font5"> It can also not be compared to sin offerings or guilt&nbsp;offerings offered by the priests (on their own behalf). Seeing&nbsp;that they themselves are the servants of the Lord, the whole&nbsp;offering had become a gift to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span><span class="font5"> What do the priests&nbsp;lose by offering the entire </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minchah</span><span class="font5"> offering to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem?</span><span class="font5"> We&nbsp;can also not make a comparison with the sin offerings and&nbsp;guilt offerings of the priests for their own sins or guilt, as in&nbsp;wither event at least the entrails are burned up on the altar,&nbsp;and the skin is distributed among the priests of that particular&nbsp;watch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Logic also dictates that the whole </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minchah</span><span class="font5"> be burned up as it is the priest who has presented it, and it would not&nbsp;make sense that he present part of his offering to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> to&nbsp;other priests. We find an example of this reasoning being&nbsp;practiced in the bulls offered by the priests during the&nbsp;consecration rites, which are burned up completely.&nbsp;(Leviticus 8,17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,18. במקום אשר תשחט העולה</span><span class="font5">, “at the site where the burnt offering will be slaughtered;” the reason why the Torah&nbsp;repeats this is because when it wrote about it the first time&nbsp;(4,24) we did not know that the rule applies to all sin offerings&nbsp;to be slaughtered at the same site as the burnt offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר יזה עליה תכבס, “</span><span class="font5">the one (part) which he has&nbsp;splashed upon you shall wash;” only that part has to be&nbsp;washed, not the whole garment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תכבס</span><span class="font5">, this is necessary as the blood of this offering is destined to be splattered </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">within</span><span class="font5"> the Sanctuary; if the&nbsp;officiating priest would leave the holy precincts with these&nbsp;bloodstains on his garments, the offering would have&nbsp;become disqualified retroactively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במקום קדוש</span><span class="font5">, “in the sacred precinct.” This includes (in Solomon’s temple) the offices adjoining the Sanctuary all of&nbsp;which were directly attached to it. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span><span class="font5"> [There were none&nbsp;such in the Tabernacle. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכל כלי חרש תשבר</span><span class="font5">, “Just as the washing (ritual&nbsp;cleansing) of garments when required had to take place&nbsp;inside the sacred precincts, so the breaking of earthen&nbsp;vessels (which had become ritually contaminated because&nbsp;the blood had been washed in it) had to take place inside the&nbsp;sacred precincts, if that vessel had to be broken (made&nbsp;useless).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בכלי נחושת</span><span class="font5">, “if, however such garment as we discussed was washed in a copper vessel, (or any metal vessel),</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומרק ושוטף</span><span class="font5">, ”it requires scouring and rinsing out with water (only).” The condition is that this scouring takes place&nbsp;during the period that the remains of that sacrifice were&nbsp;allowed to be eaten by the priests. Otherwise, it would be&nbsp;subject to the laws of נותר, sacrificial meat left uneaten, and it&nbsp;would have to be destroyed by fire. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span><span class="font5"> The “washing” i.e.&nbsp;ritual cleansing did not have to be done in a ritual bath&nbsp;containing a minimum of 40 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seah</span><span class="font5"> of water (approx 530000&nbsp;ccm). The Torah added the word: במים, to tell us that the&nbsp;quantity of water was immaterial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אש</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא, </span><span class="font5">“it is an guilt offering.” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">these two, at first glance superfluous words, seeing that the&nbsp;subject in this paragraph is the guilt offering, teach&nbsp;something about the guilt offering about a person who died&nbsp;before he had a chance to present this offering; alternately, it&nbsp;speaks of a guilt offering whose owner had attained&nbsp;atonement for his guilt before it was offered up through&nbsp;another means. For instance: normally, if the original animal&nbsp;had been sanctified and been lost before the priest appointed&nbsp;by its owner could slaughter it, so that he had substituted&nbsp;another animal for the lost one and performed all the ritual&nbsp;with it, the Torah teaches what is to be done with such an&nbsp;animal when it was found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Normally, the rules for disposition of such an animal are that it is to be offered as sacrifice on the altar when the altar&nbsp;“has summer vacation,” i.e. is not very busy with offerings&nbsp;that are mandatory for people to present. If such an animal&nbsp;had been entrusted to a shepherd to graze, in order to keep&nbsp;it alive until needed, and it was slaughtered without any&nbsp;specific designation, it is fit to be offered as a burnt offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> (in the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkah</span><span class="font5"> folio 56J the expression “summer vacation,” is to be understood as&nbsp;something similar to “dessert;” it is consumed in order to&nbsp;tickle one’s palate, not to still one’s hunger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל זכר</span><span class="font5">, “every male (priest).” This is meant to&nbsp;include priests, who because of a physical blemish, are not&nbsp;allowed to perform service in the Temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קדש קדשי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא, </span><span class="font5">“it is most holy.” This expression is meant to include communal offerings that may not be eaten&nbsp;except by male members of the priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא</span><span class="font5">, “is it;” (the offering) this excludes such offerings as the ram brought by the Nazarene at the end of his term of&nbsp;abstentions, and the mandatory thanksgiving offerings,&nbsp;known as תודה, whose status is not “the most holy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,8. והכהן המקריב</span><span class="font5">, “and the priest who offers, etc.” The singular mode used here for “the priest,” is misleading, as it&nbsp;includes all the priests belonging to this particular watch, i.e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">doing service on that day. All of them are described by the Torah as כהן. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Karney Or)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,12. אם על תודה יקריבנו</span><span class="font5">, “If he offers this offering as a thanksgiving offering;” it does require placing his weight on it&nbsp;with his hands before slaughtering, and elevating it, i.e.&nbsp;swinging it, after the slaughtering; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והקריב על זבח</span><span class="font5">, “he will offer </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the meat offering, etc;” the word על meaning “with” also in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על חלת לחם, </span><span class="font5">is also to be&nbsp;understood as meaning: “with”; we have an example of this&nbsp;in Leviticus_25<sub>J</sub>31j_^n&gt; על שדה הארץ, “it will be considered as&nbsp;belonging </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the field of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וסלת מורכבת, </span><span class="font5">“and fine flour mixed in well soaked oil.” This teaches that the cakes the Torah speaks of must be&nbsp;soaked well in oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חלות בלולות בשמן, </span><span class="font5">wafers mixed with oil. Here we have one addition followed by another addition, (חלות and רקיקות)&nbsp;something unusual. It suggests that actually it is meant to be&nbsp;a limitation, i.e. that this is not to be treated like other gift&nbsp;offerings in which a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">whole</span><span class="font5"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">log</span><span class="font5"> of oil is used, whereas here&nbsp;only half a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">log</span><span class="font5"> of oil is used. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot&nbsp;89)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,14. 'תרומה לה</span><span class="font5">, “as a gift to the Lord;” (author questions&nbsp;rhetorically why no measurements are given) I do not know&nbsp;the measurements of this gift; the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5"> writes that we might&nbsp;derive it from a similar verse in Numbers 18 where the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תרומת&nbsp;מעשר </span><span class="font5">is described as being one tenth of the regular tithe, i.e.&nbsp;slightly less that 1% of the total.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכהן הזורק את דם השלמים לו יהיה, </span><span class="font5">“it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of it.” The remainder may be&nbsp;eaten by the owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,16. ואם נדר</span><span class="font5">, “but if the sacrifice is fulfillment of a vow&nbsp;by the donor, etc.;” the donor had made the vow while he&nbsp;had been in distress.(Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום הקריבו את זבחו יאכל</span><span class="font5">, “his meat offering must be eaten on the day that he offered it and the day following;”&nbsp;immediately after the priest had completed his ritual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום השלישי באש ישרף</span><span class="font5">, “anything remaining of it on the morning of the third day must be burned.” Our sages derive&nbsp;from the apparently superfluous words: “it (the leftover) has&nbsp;to be burned on the third day,” that any leftovers of any&nbsp;sacrificial meat must be burned by day after it may no longer&nbsp;be eaten. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל טהור יאכל בשר</span><span class="font5">, “everyone that is ritually clean&nbsp;may eat of the meat.” The verse refers, of course, to meat of&nbsp;sacrificial offerings, as ordinary meat may be eaten also by&nbsp;ritually unclean people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וטומאתו עליו</span><span class="font5">, “while he is still ritually unclean;”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains here that we did not find a specific warning&nbsp;that ritually unclean people must not eat sacrificial meat,&nbsp;(although the penalty has been spelled out, something most&nbsp;unusual) but that it can be derived from a גזרה שוה, when two&nbsp;laws contain similar expressions to clarify each other. In this&nbsp;instance we find three times that the Torah decrees the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">karet&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">penalty for people eating sacrificial things while in a state of&nbsp;physical ritual impurity. (Compare Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 7 where the three verses are spelled out) [Our author&nbsp;devotes a whole page to this complicated manner of deriving&nbsp;such laws by linking it to the written Torah. Since,&nbsp;unfortunately, the subject is not applicable until we will have&nbsp;a Temple again I have decided to delete these details. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,23. כל חלב שור</span><span class="font5">, “any of the fat parts above the kidneys&nbsp;and liver of the four legged animals fit for sacrifices on the&nbsp;altar, are forbidden to be eaten.” Contrary to verse 20, where&nbsp;we encountered the penalty for eating while in a state of&nbsp;ritual impurity, though we had not heard about the warning&nbsp;not to do so, here we hear the warning, but must search for&nbsp;where the penalty has been spelled out. We find it in verse&nbsp;25. The reason why the law has been repeated is to teach us&nbsp;that the law forbidding to eat these fat parts from animals&nbsp;which the Torah has forbidden us to eat, anyway does not&nbsp;apply. [In practice this means that when someone eats an&nbsp;animal that is forbidden to be eaten, he is not penalised&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">additionally</span><span class="font5"> for eating those parts of the animal. Ed.] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,25. מן הבהמה אשר יקריב ממנה</span><span class="font5">, “who eats (fat) from the beast which people use to present as offerings;” from that&nbsp;species of beast, although it had never been sanctified as a&nbsp;potential sacrifice. This teaches that fat parts not used&nbsp;exclusively for the altar may be eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,26. וכל דם לא תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “but you must not eat any kind of blood. We have heard the warning here, now we have to&nbsp;search for the penalty if this law is contravened. It is found in&nbsp;verse 27 in this chapter: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל נפש אשר תאכל כל דם ונכרתה הנפש&nbsp;ההיא</span><span class="font5">, “the soul of any person eating any blood will be cut off&nbsp;(from his people).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בכל מושבותיכם</span><span class="font5">, “in all your dwellings;” even though any animal outside of the Holy Land is by definition only secular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.29.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מקריב את זבח שלמיו</span><span class="font5">, “he who offers his sacrifice of&nbsp;peace-offerings.” These types of offerings require to be&nbsp;accompanied by libations, need that the weight of the donor&nbsp;be placed on their head with his hands, and they need תנופה,&nbsp;physically being lifted up, the right thigh and breast being&nbsp;given to the officiating priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ידיו תביאנה</span><span class="font5">, “he shall bring it with his own hands;”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds that this means that he (the priest) is to carry it&nbsp;by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">supporting</span><span class="font5"> the hand of the donor while transporting it from&nbsp;the hall in which it is slaughtered. This is why </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds that&nbsp;three priests are needed to do all this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את החלב על החזה</span><span class="font5">, “the fat </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the breast.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זאת משחת אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “this is the consecrated portion of&nbsp;Aaron, etc.” They have been consecrated as reward for&nbsp;performing these tasks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of the word: משחה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">: </span><span class="font5">“to be anointed with that oil is a mark of distinction for them.”&nbsp;(compare Exodus 29,29 למשחה בהם)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.36. ביום משחו אותם</span><span class="font5">, “on the day that they were anointed.” The prefix letter ב has been used here instead of&nbsp;the more common prefix מ the meaning being: “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font5"> the day&nbsp;they were anointed. From this day on, these portions of the&nbsp;sacrificial animals were perpetually given to the priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.37. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זאת התורה לעולה, </span><span class="font5">“this is the law for the burnt&nbsp;offering;” this is a reference to the skin of the burnt offering&nbsp;which has not been burned up;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולמנחה</span><span class="font5">, “and for the gift offering;” this is a reference to the part of this offering that has not been consumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולחטאת ולאשם</span><span class="font5">, “and for the sin offering, and for the guilt offering; the meat of which is to be consumed by the priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולמלואים</span><span class="font5">, and for the consecration offerings which we learned about earlier in Exodus chapter 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולזבח השלמים</span><span class="font5">, and for the sacrifice known as peace-offerings. This is a reference to the breast, right thigh, and the parts given to the priests of the mandatory thanksgiving&nbsp;offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.38. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;להקריב את קרבניהם לה׳ במדבר סיני</span><span class="font5">, “to present their&nbsp;offerings to the Lord in the desert of Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why this line is necessary, although most of us would have understood the chapter without it being&nbsp;repeated, is because until the Israelites had made camp at&nbsp;Mount Sinai they had not offered a single offering (Exodus&nbsp;24,5) The altar which Moses had built after the battle with&nbsp;Amalek was located at Mount Sinai. (Exodus 17,15) “Mount&nbsp;Chorev” and “Mount Sinai” are two names describing the&nbsp;same Mountain or group of peaks. The Israelites encamped&nbsp;around there for a period of 10 days less than a year from&nbsp;the first day of Sivan (in the first year) to the twentieth day of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">iyar</span><span class="font5"> of the second year. (Numbers 10,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the remainder of their journeys, for almost 39 years they did not offer any sacrifices as stated by the&nbsp;prophet Amos 5,25: הזבחים ומנחה הגשתם לי בני ישראל במדבר, “did&nbsp;you offer to Me any sacrifices or oblations in the forty years&nbsp;in the desert?” Even the Passover offering was presented&nbsp;only in Egypt and in the following year, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the Israelites&nbsp;had broken camp.” According to our author, offerings were&nbsp;brought on the Day of Atonement of the second year, but we&nbsp;do not know his source for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,2. קח את אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “take Aaron, etc.” this paragraph was told to Moses on the twenty third day of Adar during the first&nbsp;year. (Compare Targum Yonatan on verse 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,3. </span><span class="font5">ו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את כל העדה הקהל </span><span class="font5">“and assemble the whole congregation!” They were all to treat the priests as holy.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">8,7.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ויאפוד לו</span><span class="font5">, “and he girded him;” the letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פ </span><span class="font5">in this word has a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dagesh,</span><span class="font5"> (dot.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,10. וימשח את המשכן ואת כל אשר בו</span><span class="font5">, “He anointed the Tabernacle and all the furnishings therein.” Each vessel in&nbsp;the Tabernacle and each item of furnishing was anointed&nbsp;separately. But Aaron and his sons were anointed while&nbsp;wearing their priestly garments, as is written in Psalms 133,2:</span></p>
<p dir="rtl"><span class="font5">.כשמן הטוב היורד על הראש ירד על הזקן, זקן אהרן שיורד על פי מדותיו</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“like the fine oil on the head running down onto the beard, that comes down over the collar of his robes.” The word:&nbsp;מדותיו, is to be understood as in Leviticus 6,3: מדו בד.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,14. ויגש את פר החטאת</span><span class="font5">, “He led forward the bull for the sin offering;” now, when the Torah reports details, this bull is&nbsp;referred to as “the bull of the sin offering,” whereas&nbsp;previously in Exodus 29,10 this animal was simply referred to&nbsp;as: הפר, “the bull.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,22. על העולה</span><span class="font5">, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the burnt offering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,30. ויקח משה משמן המשחה</span><span class="font5">, Moses took some of the anointing oil;” here the Torah speaks of after he had burned&nbsp;up the fat parts of the second ram and its fatty tail and the&nbsp;remainder of the kidneys and the right thigh, Moses took&nbsp;some of the anointing oil and sprinkled it on Aaron and his&nbsp;sons, whereas in the text describing that Moses was&nbsp;commanded what to do and how, this procedure in Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">29,21, the procedure is described as in the reverse order.&nbsp;(Nachmanides raised the same point and attempted to&nbsp;answer the apparent contradiction)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,32. בבשר ובלחם, </span><span class="font5">“of the flesh and of the bread;” the&nbsp;prefix letter in the word בבשר is to be understood as meaning&nbsp;“from,” i.e. מ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,33. לא תצא שבעת ימים</span><span class="font5">, “do not leave (the door) of the tent for seven days;” this is not to be understood as a house&nbsp;arrest, but means that Aaron and his sons are not to&nbsp;undertake any other activities and not go to another tent&nbsp;even. However, at night they were at liberty to perform what&nbsp;any normal person needs to do. We have another example of&nbsp;a similar construction in Deuteronomy 34,8 where the whole&nbsp;people of Israel is described as mourning Moses and&nbsp;weeping over his death for thirty days, and the meaning&nbsp;surely is not that they did not move from their tents during all&nbsp;this time even to use the sanitary facilities. The same&nbsp;construction is used in connection with the commandment to&nbsp;dwell in the huts on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font5"> for seven days, (Leviticus 23,42)&nbsp;as well as in Leviticus 21,12: “he (the High Priest when&nbsp;mourning his father or mother) must not leave the&nbsp;Tabernacle.” (Compare Ibn Ezra on our verse).</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Sh’mini</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,1. ויהי ביום השמיני קרא משה לאהרן ולבניו</span><span class="font5">, “It came to pass&nbsp;on the eighth day that Moses called upon Aaron and his sons;”&nbsp;he intended to consecrate them as priests;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולזקני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “and the elders of Israel;” so that they could stand and watch them present their sacrificial offerings.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">9,2</span><span class="font5"> </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קח לך עגל, </span><span class="font5">“take for yourself a calf;” it was customary for the priest to take a bull as a sin offering as is written in&nbsp;Leviticus 4,3: ,'אם הכהן המשיח יחטא וגו, “if the High Priest will sin,&nbsp;etc.; in other words, the calf will atone for the sin of the golden&nbsp;calf. [According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5"> we must understand that verse as&nbsp;referring specifically to this High Priest. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;קחו שעיר עזים</span><span class="font5">, “take a he-goat as a sin offering to&nbsp;atone for your sins, etc;” they had to pray for atonement for&nbsp;what their forefathers had done to Joseph, when they had sent&nbsp;his tunic soaked in the blood they had taken from the he-goat&nbsp;they slaughtered for that purpose. (Genesis 37, 31-32) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: They needed to offer a sin offering for idolatry they had been guilty by burning he goats&nbsp;for idols. (in Egypt) (Tanchuma, section 4 on this portion) We&nbsp;find that also on other occasions such animals were burned in&nbsp;idolatrous rites outside the camp. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Torat Kohanim, chovah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">chapter 6,5.) This is why this he-goat was burned </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">outside</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;camp, as we are told in verse 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומנחה בלולה בשמן</span><span class="font5">, “and a gift with oil mixed in;” the&nbsp;same applied to frankincense, as we had already learned in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Vayikra,</span><span class="font5"> chapter 2, a standard procedure with all such&nbsp;gift offerings. We have also learned this in the Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot</span><span class="font5"> folio 59. All of these gift offerings consisted of&nbsp;unleavened dough, including this one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי היום ה׳ נראה אליכם</span><span class="font5">, “for today the Lord will appear to you.” This is why it is appropriate to appear before him with a&nbsp;variety of offerings, including samples of all the categories of&nbsp;offerings. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,6. זה הדבר</span><span class="font5">, “this is the thing;” the sacrifices of which we spoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,7. קרב אל המזבח</span><span class="font5">, “come close to the altar;” seeing that during all of the seven days of the consecration Moses was&nbsp;performing all the duties in the Tabernacle and around it, he&nbsp;had to tell Aaron on the eighth day that the time had come for&nbsp;him and his sons to take over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכפר בעדך</span><span class="font5">, “and (commence) by obtaining atonement for yourself,” and subsequently,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“for the people,” </span><span class="font5">so that someone free from guilt performs these rites. After all, both Aaron as well as the people&nbsp;had born a share of the guilt associated with the sin of the&nbsp;golden calf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,11. ואת הבשר ואת העור, </span><span class="font5">“and both the meat and the skin, etc;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains here that there is no other occasion when&nbsp;the blood of the sin offering is sprinkled on the altar </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">outside</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;Tabernacle, except in this instance and on the preceding&nbsp;seven days. (when Moses officiated.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to question that we find that the blood of the second bull offered by the Levites in Numbers 8,8-15 was also&nbsp;offered before the Levites entered the Tabernacle, and that in&nbsp;the Book of Ezra chapter 8,35, we encounter something&nbsp;similar, a) these were consecration offerings prior to the&nbsp;second Temple beginning to function, and b) Ezekiel had&nbsp;already predicted in Ezekiel 45,18-20, that in the new Temple&nbsp;the ritual involving all these sin offerings would take place&nbsp;outside the doorposts of Temple itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> meant when he commented on our verse refers to every place when the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">consecration</span><span class="font5"> rites of the&nbsp;Tabernacle in the desert had been discussed, as well as when&nbsp;the consecration rites in the days of Ezra were discussed and&nbsp;when the prophet prophesied about the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">consecration</span><span class="font5"> rites of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">third</span><span class="font5"> Temple, hopefully in our own days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer given to the question raised above in the first chapter of the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Horiyot,</span><span class="font5"> is that what was done&nbsp;in the days of Ezra was an emergency measure, one from&nbsp;which no conclusions may be drawn for normal times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שרף באש</span><span class="font5">, “he burned in fire;” the reason for this has already been explained in both Exodus 29,14, and in the last&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,17. מלבד עולת הבקר</span><span class="font5">, “except for the burnt offering in the morning.” This teaches that on this occasion two gift offerings&nbsp;were presented, one which was part of the daily burnt offering&nbsp;in the mornings, the other on its own. (Compare verse 4 in our&nbsp;chapter, and chapter 28 in the Book of Numbers).)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישא אהרן את ידיו, </span><span class="font5">“Aaron raised his hands, etc.;” this&nbsp;verse has been truncated somewhat; it should have&nbsp;commenced with: “from having completed the rites of the sin&nbsp;offering and the burnt offering and he then raised his hand in&nbsp;order to bless the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וירד מעשות החטאת, “</span><span class="font5">he descended from the altar from performing the rites of the sin offering,” i.e. burning up the&nbsp;parts not to be eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.23. ויבא משה ואהרן אל אהל מועד</span><span class="font5">, “Moses and Aaron entered the Tent of Meeting.” They did so in order to see the&nbsp;glory when heavenly fire would descend as proof that their&nbsp;sacrificial service had been accepted in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'וירא כבוד ה, “</span><span class="font5">the glory of the Lord appeared.” How so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ותצא </span><span class="font5">אש </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וגו</span><span class="font5">, “Heavenly fire descended,” etc.; the&nbsp;heavenly fire that was visible in the time of Moses did not&nbsp;depart from the copper altar until the days of the Temple of&nbsp;Solomon. It disappeared only in the days of King Menashe,&nbsp;who had incurred G’d’s wrath more than any King of the&nbsp;kingdom of Yehudah before him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,1.וישימו עליה קטורת</span><span class="font5">, “they placed incense on it.” They had taken this from the table. This is what is meant by the line:&nbsp;ויקריבו לפני ה' אש זרה, “they tendered before the Lord alien fire.”&nbsp;Incense without fire is an impossibility. Any incense offering&nbsp;that is not presented in the name of a community is called:&nbsp;“alien.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר לא צוה אותם</span><span class="font5">, “which He had not commanded them (to offer)”. The meaning, as opposed to the translation, is: “that He&nbsp;had commanded them not to offer.” Proof of this is to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">be found in Exodus 30,9: לא תעלו עליו קטורת זרה, “do not offer alien incense upon it.!” An example of a similar&nbsp;construction is found in Jeremiah 7,31: לשרוף את בניהם ואת&nbsp;בנותיהם באש אשר לא צויתי, “to burn their sons and daughters,&nbsp;which I did not command.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,2. ותצא אש</span><span class="font5">, “Fire came forth;” the Torah first reports the fact that fire originated in heaven, before going into details,&nbsp;i.e. that this fire was triggered by actions taken by the two sons&nbsp;of Aaron mentioned here. The fire mentioned here is the fire&nbsp;mentioned in verse 24 of the previous chapter. The “details”&nbsp;commence with verse 1 in our chapter, i.e. “the two sons of&nbsp;Aaron, Nadav and Avihu each took his own censer and placed&nbsp;man made fire and incense on them, fire that G’d had&nbsp;forbidden to be put on these censers.” It was the custom of&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font5"> heavenly fire to travel first to the Holy of Holies and from&nbsp;there to the golden altar in the Sanctuary and there to&nbsp;consume the incense offered. In this instance, the heavenly&nbsp;fire did not stop there, but travelled beyond the boundary of the&nbsp;Sanctuary to the copper altar in front of the Sanctuary and&nbsp;consumed these two sons of Aaron there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותצא אש</span><span class="font5">; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> quoting Rabbi Eliezer, the reason why the sons of Aaron were killed was that they had&nbsp;arrogated to themselves the right to render halachic rulings&nbsp;while their mentor Moses was alive and well, to do this himself.&nbsp;What prompted them to do this? They reasoned that although&nbsp;the fire to burn up the incense was provided by heaven it was&nbsp;still a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mitzvah</span><span class="font5"> to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">add</span><span class="font5"> man-made fire, seeing that the Torah has&nbsp;written in Leviticus 1,7, “the sons of Aaron are to put fire on the&nbsp;altar.” ונתנו בני אהרן הכהן אש על המזבח.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They failed to confirm with their teacher Moses that they had correctly interpreted this verse. This is why the Torah&nbsp;wrote: “which He had not commanded them.” We have a clear&nbsp;statement in the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Taanit</span><span class="font5"> folio 22, that the King&nbsp;Yoshiahu, [the most observant King the Kingdom of Yehudah&nbsp;ever ruled, was punished and killed by enemy troops for&nbsp;having failed to check with the prophet Jeremiah if to go to war&nbsp;against the Egyptians, who only wanted right of passage. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is another opinion according to whom the sin of Nadav and Avihu was not the fact that they brought alien fire&nbsp;into the Sanctuary, but that they had done it on that day. As far&nbsp;as the verse we quoted from Leviticus 1,7, is concerned, the&nbsp;instructions of that verse were to become effective only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the first day on which the Tabernacle operated under the&nbsp;leadership of the High Priest, Aaron. They were also misled as&nbsp;heavenly fire on previous days when Moses performed the&nbsp;service in the Tabernacle had occurred earlier in the day. The&nbsp;reason why G’d had delayed was that He wished to be&nbsp;honoured by a large turnout of the people who would witness&nbsp;that event. This would then be the meaning of the words in&nbsp;verse 1: “that He had not commanded them.” G’d had waited,&nbsp;not as on the occasion of the revelation on Mount Sinai when&nbsp;in spite of having previously announced that He would&nbsp;manifest His glory on the Mountain, He had done so but the&nbsp;people had not bothered to rise early. (Compare Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19,11, 16, 17-18) Nadav and Avihu meant to avoid G’d’s&nbsp;honour not being sufficiently appreciated by the people. We&nbsp;find something parallel in Kings I 18,25, where the prophet&nbsp;Elijah tells the priests of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baal</span><span class="font5"> not to set fire to their&nbsp;offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותאכל אותם וימותו</span><span class="font5">, “it consumed them so that they died (on the spot)”. The punishment fitted the crime. They were killed&nbsp;by heavenly fire as they had diminished the glory of the Lord&nbsp;which is described as being comparable to אש אוכלת&nbsp;“consuming fire.” (Exodus 24,17) Both Nadav and Avihu had&nbsp;been warned on that occasion not to look upon the G’d of&nbsp;Israel, as we know from verse 10 in the above quoted chapter,&nbsp;where the Torah added or hinted that on that joyful occasion&nbsp;G’d did not want to kill the happy mood of the people by&nbsp;punishing those who had transgressed the warning not feast&nbsp;their eyes on what they thought was the true image of G’d.&nbsp;They were warned again in Numbers 11,1 when badmouthing&nbsp;G’d and being killed by heavenly fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'וימותו לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “They died in the presence of the Lord. This is an unusual expression. Are we not all, at any given moment,&nbsp;“in the Presence” of the Lord? Rabbi Eliezer says this&nbsp;expression teaches that they did not die until having left the&nbsp;sacred precincts and being in the antechamber where Levites&nbsp;were permitted. We have proof of this from verse 4 where the&nbsp;cousins of these brothers, by the names of Mishael and&nbsp;Eltzafan were charge with removing their bodies from there for&nbsp;burial. Not only that. They were moved while still wearing their&nbsp;garments which had not been burned by the heavenly fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Apparently, their cousins hooked their spears into the outer garments and dragged them until they were outside the&nbsp;sacred parts of the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,3. הוא אשר דבר ה׳ לאמור: בקרובי אקדש, </span><span class="font5">“this is what the Lord said: “I will be sanctified through those who are near Me.”&nbsp;Where had the Lord said this? In Exodus 19,22: ונועדתי שמה&nbsp;לבני ישראל ונקדש בכבודי, “this is where I will make Myself known&nbsp;to the Children of Israel, and where My glory will be sanctified.”&nbsp;(Exodus 29,43)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: where is the verse proving this? (Exodus 19,2) וגם הכהנים הנגשים אל ה׳ יתקדשו פן יפרוץ בהם ה׳,&nbsp;“and also the priests who came close to the Lord have to&nbsp;sanctify themselves” [by not doing what </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> think is best, but&nbsp;by what G’d had thought best. Ed.], “so that the Lord will not&nbsp;break out against them.” This verse is addressed specifically to&nbsp;the High Priests whom G’d warns that they especially have to&nbsp;be on guard not to infringe on the rules laid down for them&nbsp;even in the slightest. Any deviation on their part would have to&nbsp;result in G’d becoming “sanctified” through His immediate, and&nbsp;for the priest in question fatal, punishment, as otherwise it&nbsp;would be seen as a desecration of the Lord’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the High Priest, the Torah had therefore written: in Leviticus 21,10: “and he must not let his hair grow&nbsp;loose, nor rend his clothes, and not leave the Temple in order&nbsp;to follow the bier of his father on the way to burial, etc.” (verse&nbsp;12 there) The point that Moses is making to his brother in our&nbsp;verse is that the higher one’s rank, the more strictly G’d&nbsp;applies the rules laid down for their conduct. A High Priest,&nbsp;exactly by not leaving G’d’s Temple in order to attend his&nbsp;father or mother’s funeral, demonstrates that G’d’s honour&nbsp;comes first, and he cannot take time out for his personal&nbsp;concerns. There is no better way to demonstrate this than the&nbsp;example mentioned in the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is true that the subject has not been dealt with sequentially, but we must remember that the Author of the&nbsp;Torah</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[maybe </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">because</span><span class="font5"> “Time” is subservient to Him and not vice versa, as it is to His creatures, deliberately demonstrated&nbsp;this by not revealing what He has to say to us in chronological&nbsp;order, on occasion. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועל פני כל העם אכבד</span><span class="font5">, “and I will be honoured in the presence of the whole nation.” They will all be witness to how&nbsp;and where and why Aaron’s sons had died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וידום אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “Aaron responded by accepting this silently.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This response is repeated by the prophet Ezekiel quoting G’d saying to him after the death of his wife (Ezekiel 24,17:&nbsp;האנק דום אבל מתים לא תעשה, “moan softly, do not observe the&nbsp;ritual of mourning for the dead.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר אליהם קרבו</span><span class="font5">, “he said to them (Aaron’s great&nbsp;nephews) come forward;” he had to reassure them that they&nbsp;did not have to fear any interference by G’d. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pessikta zutrata).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בכתנותם</span><span class="font5">, “in their tunics;” not the tunics of the&nbsp;pallbearers. Only priests, not Levites, wore those tunics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ראשיכם אל תפרעו</span><span class="font5">, “let not the hair of your head grow&nbsp;loose;” seeing that your are ‘valets’ of the Lord, it is not seemly&nbsp;that you should display your mourning in that way and that you&nbsp;weep; your brothers, however may observe normal rites of&nbsp;mourning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובגדיכם לא תפרומו</span><span class="font5">, “and do not rend your garments;” even though you are not priests, but on this occasion you are similar&nbsp;to a High Priest in this respect. Concerning the High Priest the&nbsp;Torah had written in Leviticus 21,10: את ראשו לא יפרע ובגדיו לא&nbsp;יפרום, “he must not let his hair grow loose on his head, he must&nbsp;not rend his garments (in mourning).” We know from Leviticus&nbsp;13,45, that someone whom the priest has confirmed as having&nbsp;been stricken with the dread skin disease </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> must rend&nbsp;his clothes and let his hair grow loose (as an external sign that&nbsp;he is suffering from this disease.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועל כל העדה יקצוף</span><span class="font5">, “and He will display His anger at the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;community if you observe mourning.” This</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">commandment was applicable only on that day when these pallbearers removed the bodies of Nadav and Avihu from the&nbsp;sacred precincts where they had been struck down by&nbsp;heavenly fire. We find a similar construction in Psalms 9,19:&nbsp;“the hope of the humble beggars will not always be&nbsp;disappointed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate commentary: “if you were to observe mourning now, G’d will demonstrate His anger by not&nbsp;accepting the sacrifices you offer Him this day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תצאו</span><span class="font5">, “do not leave, etc,” the priests (Aaron and&nbsp;his remaining two sons) must not leave the sacred precincts of&nbsp;the Temple seeing that they had been anointed with anointing&nbsp;oil to do service in the Tabernacle by Divine decree. This is&nbsp;what we learned from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat Kohanim,</span><span class="font5"> who cites that Moses&nbsp;spoke separately on the subject to Mishael and Eltzafan,&nbsp;whereas when he spoke now to Aaron and his surviving sons,&nbsp;he did not address Mischael and Eltzafan, Levites, but not&nbsp;priests. The reason was that it could be derived that any&nbsp;priests must not contaminate themselves spiritually by contact&nbsp;with dead bodies, otherwise why could not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> have been the&nbsp;pallbearers of their brothers? Our author questions this&nbsp;statement found in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra,</span><span class="font5"> by asking rhetorically, why this&nbsp;verse had be used to teach us this fact, when there are many&nbsp;other verses which spell this out directly. Furthermore, Elazar&nbsp;and Ittamar were only ordinary priests not High Priests, The&nbsp;Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zevachim,</span><span class="font5"> folio 100, states specifically that&nbsp;ordinary priests may defile themselves in order to bury a&nbsp;brother or unmarried sister. We must therefore understand&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat Kohanim</span><span class="font5"> as stating that from our verse we can derive&nbsp;that it is not only permitted for an ordinary priest to bury his&nbsp;nearest relatives, (7) but that it is a duty that he participate&nbsp;personally in such a funeral. Elazar and Ittamar were in a class&nbsp;by themselves as they had had to be anointed, just like their&nbsp;father, in order to become priests. Future priests would be&nbsp;priests from birth because their fathers were priests, and they&nbsp;would not need anointing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וידבר אל אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “he spoke to Aaron etc,” this&nbsp;paragraph was revealed on the day that the Tabernacle had&nbsp;been erected, seeing that from that day onward they had been&nbsp;forbidden to become drunk, seeing that this prohibition had&nbsp;been linked to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">entering</span><span class="font5"> the Tabernacle since Exodus 30,20, as&nbsp;stated by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> in the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin</span><span class="font5"> folio 60. The&nbsp;reason is that the prohibition was not restricted to the priest’s&nbsp;performing sacrificial </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">service</span><span class="font5"> in the Temple but to his entering&nbsp;the Temple precincts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.9. 'יין ושכר וגו</span><span class="font5">, wine and other alcoholic drink, etc.” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the addition of the word ושכר in this verse&nbsp;is meant to refer to a quantity that will cause drunkenness by&nbsp;the person consuming the wine. (based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat Kohanim)&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">This has also been confirmed in the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">K’ritut,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 13, where Rabbi Eliezer understands the verse to mean:&nbsp;“do not drink wine in quantities liable to result in your becoming&nbsp;drunk, or in a manner which will lead to drunkenness.” If, for&nbsp;instance, the priest drinking wine had first added water to it in&nbsp;order to weaken its capacity to intoxicate, he would not be&nbsp;guilty of violating this commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל תשת</span><span class="font5">, “do not drink!” Even though in according to Jewish custom other mourners are given wine to drink, as is&nbsp;written in Proverbs 31,6: תנו שכר לאובד ויין למרי נפש, “give liquor&nbsp;to those who are about to perish, and wine to those who are&nbsp;embittered,” you and your sons must not drink it is as you are&nbsp;not used to it as you do not observe the customs of mourners.&nbsp;Furthermore, you are prohibited from imbibing on pain of death&nbsp;when you are on duty in the holy precincts to the Temple. It is&nbsp;simply not befitting that a drunk person should perform&nbsp;sacrificial service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.10. ולהבדיל בין הקדש ובין החול</span><span class="font5">, “and in order to separate between what is holy and what is secular.” This is a line&nbsp;referring to people that have been sanctified. Compare&nbsp;Leviticus chapter 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובין הטמא ובין הטהור</span><span class="font5">, “and between the ritually impure and the ritually pure.” This is a reference to things ritually impure&nbsp;and things ritually pure,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.11. ולהורות, </span><span class="font5">and to instruct (others) in the laws,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את כל החוקים</span><span class="font5">, these are the interpretations,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'אשר דבר ה</span><span class="font5">, ”which the Lord has revealed by word of mouth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביד משה, </span><span class="font5">the written Torah, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whence do we know about the Targum? answer: from the word להורות, “i.e. to explain the meaning of the text.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אצל המזבח</span><span class="font5">, “next to the altar,” and not within the&nbsp;Sanctuary nor on the altar. How do I know that the Torah also&nbsp;excludes the Holy of Holies? The Torah wrote: קדש קדשים היא,&nbsp;“it is most holy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קדש קדשים היא</span><span class="font5">, thus far I only know that this expression refers to the proximity of the altar, how do I know that it&nbsp;includes the offices adjoining the Temple walls? (The Torah&nbsp;discusses the permanent Temple in the future). The answer is&nbsp;found in the words: ואכלתם אותה במקום קדוש, “you are to eat it&nbsp;on consecrated grounds.”(Verse 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אותה והיא</span><span class="font5">, “both of these words are restrictive by&nbsp;definition, they come to exclude the thanksgiving offering and&nbsp;its attending loaves of bread or wafers, and the ram to be&nbsp;offered by the Nazirite at the conclusion of his term and the&nbsp;loaves accompanying that offering, as well as the ram of the&nbsp;consecration rites of the priests, (a one time offering).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת חזה התנופה</span><span class="font5">, “and the breast of waving,” this&nbsp;refers to the waving of the basket.” Compare 8,2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תאכלו במקום טהור</span><span class="font5">, “you are to eat in a spiritually pure place.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> asks the rhetorical question if the Torah meant to&nbsp;tell us that the offerings mentioned earlier were eaten in ritually&nbsp;contaminated places? Surely not! He therefore understands&nbsp;our verse as referring to the parts of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">minchah</span><span class="font5"> offering&nbsp;(except half a fistful) which was not burned up on the altar.&nbsp;These “remains” could be eaten anywhere inside the camp,&nbsp;also outside the consecrated area around the Tabernacle, as&nbsp;the soil of the camp was ritually pure, any person afflicted with&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> having been banished from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מזבחי שלמי בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the Children of Israel.” This line is meant to include&nbsp;those offered already on the day this law was introduced, as&nbsp;mentioned in chapter 9.4. (See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5"> on that verse.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,16. ואת שעיר החטאת</span><span class="font5">, “and concerning the male goat sin offering;” according to the plain meaning of this verse, the&nbsp;animal referred is that first mentioned in chapter 9,3, where</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses had commanded the people of Israel to take such an animal as a sin offering. Both in that verse and here the&nbsp;people for whom atonement was sought were called by almost&nbsp;identical names, i.e. עם or .</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עדה</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שעיר החטאת</span><span class="font5">, “the male goat serving as sin offering.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> the reference is to the mandatory sin&nbsp;offering on New Moon, and this day was the first day of Nissan&nbsp;of the second year. On this day three such animals were&nbsp;offered as sin offerings. The one mentioned by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the one&nbsp;that was part of the consecration rites, and the one offered as&nbsp;the first of twelve identical offerings by each of the princes of&nbsp;the tribes, Nachshon. Of all these three sin offerings only the&nbsp;one meant as the New Moon’s sin offering was burned (not&nbsp;offered and its parts eaten as prescribed) There are different&nbsp;opinions as to the reason for this. Some scholars hold that the&nbsp;priests had become ritually defiled by having touched the&nbsp;corpses of Nadav and Avihu. If you were to argue that even&nbsp;without their having become ritually defiled they could not have&nbsp;offered that offering in the proper manner as they had been&nbsp;ritually impure by having been in contact with at least one&nbsp;corpse since they had been born;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">they had not undergone purification rites for this, there not having been a red heifer yet without which such purification&nbsp;rites could not have been performed until at the earliest on the&nbsp;following day; we would have to answer that they had become&nbsp;ritually purified by dint of their having been anointed with the&nbsp;holy oil of anointing, (Leviticus 8,2) as well as by the blood&nbsp;which had been sprinkled on the altar. (Compare Talmud,&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 4.) The Tabernacle had been erected on&nbsp;the first of the month, and the red heifer was slaughtered and&nbsp;burned on the second of the month. The Talmud explained&nbsp;there that on that occasion the water took the place of blood&nbsp;just as when the Jewish people had to purify themselves at the&nbsp;revelation of Mount Sinai when there had not yet been a red&nbsp;heifer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,17. לכפר עליכם, </span><span class="font5">“to obtain atonement for you.” This refers to the he goat of the new Moon. We have read in&nbsp;connection with the New Moon at the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey</span><span class="font5">: ושעיר&nbsp;עזים אחד לחטאת לכפר עליכם, and one male goat as a sin offering&nbsp;to atone on your behalf. (Numbers 29,5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,19. הן היום הקריבו</span><span class="font5">, “behold they have offered their sin offerings and burnt offerings this day,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains this line&nbsp;as follows: “what kind of answer does Aaron give to Moses&nbsp;here? Moses had asked him why they had not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">eaten</span><span class="font5"> from the&nbsp;offerings? If they had not first </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">offered</span><span class="font5"> them, how could they&nbsp;have eaten from the remains? Besides, aJi the offerings of that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">day had been performed by Aaron, not by his sons, as the Torah has already stated!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What Moses must have meant and have said referring to the sons of Aaron was: “did you perhaps perform the sprinkling&nbsp;of the blood, etc, seeing that a priest in mourning would have&nbsp;disqualified and desecrated that offering?” To this implication&nbsp;Aaron answered: “did </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> perform the ritual? Seeing that they&nbsp;are only ordinary priests, how could they have arrogated to&nbsp;themselves the right to substitute for me? I have performed all&nbsp;the rites? Seeing that I am not legally a mourner as my sons&nbsp;have not yet been buried, I have performed all these rites&nbsp;seeing they must be performed during certain hours of this&nbsp;day. This is also why they have been eaten.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותקראנה אותי כאלה</span><span class="font5">, “seeing that I have been struck by such a tragic loss,” that two of my sons who were priests have died&nbsp;suddenly; they were supposed to help me eat the relevant&nbsp;parts of the sacrifice so that none would have become&nbsp;leftovers that had to be burned. I, in my state of pre-mourning,&nbsp;was not allowed to eat these parts, just as the Levites if in&nbsp;such a state of pre-mourning would not have been allowed to&nbsp;sing the songs which it is their duty to sing.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra</span><span class="font5"> on this&nbsp;verse)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואכלתי חטאת היום</span><span class="font5">, “I have eaten the parts of the sin offering this day that I was halachically permitted to eat&nbsp;together with my two remaining sons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'הייטב בעיני ה</span><span class="font5">, “would it have been pleasing in the eyes of the Lord that these parts would have become “leftovers, ”and&nbsp;thus would have to be burned outside the holy precincts,&nbsp;seeing that only three of us are left?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Karney Or);</span><span class="font5"> the word is similar to the word מוגרים in Michah 1,4: מים מוגרים, “cascading&nbsp;waters,” i.e. that it describes the mixing of what the animal ate&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font5"> drank, before the mixture descends to its intestines.</span></p><h1 dir="rtl"><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אך את זה לא תאכלו ממעלי הגרה וממפריסי הפרסה .11,4</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">“however only the following you must not eat even though they either have cleft hooves or are chewing the cud;” the reason&nbsp;that the animals mentioned now are forbidden is that they&nbsp;possess only one of the two distinguishing marks mentioned in&nbsp;the previous verse. For instance: the pig, the camel and the&nbsp;hare and rabbit. The Torah did not have to spell out that&nbsp;animals which do not possess even one of the above&nbsp;distinguishing features are also forbidden. Most of them are&nbsp;not even considered as worthwhile eating by the gentile&nbsp;nations (because they are predators and their meat is not&nbsp;tasty). </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,6. ואת הארנבת</span><span class="font5">, “and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">arnevet”;</span><span class="font5"> some commentators say that this animal is one that are not found as male, [as all&nbsp;the other animals that are mentioned are always mentioned as&nbsp;feminine; Ed.] the same would be true of the bird called בת&nbsp;היענה. The objection raised by some scholars that this cannot&nbsp;be so as we know of masculine יעינים found in deserts&nbsp;(Lamentations 4,3) Those are also feminine, in spite of the&nbsp;masculine endings in their names, as are ,דובים עזים, רחלים&nbsp;גמלים, דובים, she-goats, she-camels, etc.; they all have&nbsp;masculine sounding endings, even though the respective&nbsp;animal in question may be a female specimen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,8, מבשרם לא תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “you must not eat any of their meat.” This prohibition is applicable regardless of whether the&nbsp;animal in question has died of natural causes or has been&nbsp;slaughtered ritually, something that saves an animal from&nbsp;being labelled as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">neveilah,</span><span class="font5"> cadaver.

The&nbsp;word is reminiscent of Bileam’s describing his visions of future&nbsp;events with his eyes as: אשורנו. (Numbers, 23,9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Translation of these birds presents the editor with a problem as there is disagreement among the scholars.&nbsp;Basically, seeing that the Torah did not give clear guidelines&nbsp;how to recognise the few species (20) we are not allowed to&nbsp;eat, I will limit myself to the statement by our sages that they&nbsp;are all birds of prey and that the arrangement of their toe nails&nbsp;is a clue as to their nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> folio 63 deals with this. Principally, if the bird has two toes at the back of its leg and&nbsp;two in front, it is a sign that it is a bird of prey, as that enables it&nbsp;to better grab and hold on to its prey. In ritually pure birds the&nbsp;three toes are at the front and only one at the back. In addition&nbsp;to this if it has a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">zaphak a</span><span class="font5"> crop, and/or a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">korkovov,</span><span class="font5"> gizzard,&nbsp;maw beneath its chin that can be peeled off without difficulty&nbsp;this is a sign that it is a forbidden species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reserved for illustrations</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,21. אשר לו כרעים</span><span class="font5">, “which have jointed legs,” The word לו is spelled לא in the text, to hint at the dual nature of these&nbsp;(additional) legs. It is read as if it had been spelled as shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.22, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הארבה, </span><span class="font5">“the species known as locusts. The word is&nbsp;related to הרבה, “many,” there being so many different&nbsp;subcategories.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכל שרץ העוף</span><span class="font5">, “and all winged swarming things;” in&nbsp;respect of fish and birds that are forbidden to eat, the Torah&nbsp;did not use the term טומאת מגע, ritual contamination through&nbsp;touching, it only wrote that we should detest them. The reason&nbsp;is that seeing that seeing that they have mostly been created&nbsp;in water, they are treated as if part of that domain. In&nbsp;accordance with this approach, we find that our sages in&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">keylim</span><span class="font5"> 17,13, state that any creatures that live in water&nbsp;are not subject to ritual contamination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,26. לכל הבהמה אשר היא</span><span class="font5">, “all of the above mentioned four legged domestic beasts (when dead) that do not possess the&nbsp;features mentioned confer ritual impurity upon people touching&nbsp;them or carrying them even if death had been caused by ritual&nbsp;slaughter. (Compare verse 8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל הנוגע בהם יטמא</span><span class="font5">, “everyone who touches them will be considered ritually unclean.” This is the verse that makes clear&nbsp;that there is no way such animals can escape conferring ritual&nbsp;contamination by any manner of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והנושא את נבלתם</span><span class="font5">, “and anyone carrying their&nbsp;cadavers, etc.” By repeating this the Torah teaches that merely&nbsp;moving such a carcass, even without directly touching it&nbsp;confers ritual impurity on the person doing so. The Jerusalem&nbsp;Targum uses the word מסיט to describe such indirect&nbsp;“carrying.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על הארץ, </span><span class="font5">“on the earth;” as opposed to the ones “in&nbsp;the water.”</span></p>

Ed.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר יפול מה</span><span class="font5">ם, “when into one of them falls;” we find&nbsp;a similar construction to this in Judges 12,7, i.e. באחד מערי גלעד&nbsp;where according to the text as written, -ויקבר בערי גלעד</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">literally:&nbsp;“he was buried in the cities of Gilead,” we might have thought&nbsp;that different parts of his body were buried in different cities,&nbsp;which is of course absurd. The author simply did not feel it&nbsp;necessary to add the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחד, </span><span class="font5">“one of,” in order for the reader&nbsp;to understand his meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל תוכו, </span><span class="font5">“into its inside;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments here that earthen vessels do not become ritually unclean except through&nbsp;the airspace they enclose. The reason for this is that because&nbsp;there is no way to dispose of this contamination except by&nbsp;breaking the vessel in question, the Torah, out of concern for&nbsp;the owner, did not want to make it easy for such vessels to&nbsp;become ritually contaminated, as by its outside coming into&nbsp;contact with ritually polluted items. This is why the Torah&nbsp;wrote: (Numbers 19,15) וכל כלי פתוח אשר אין צמיד פתיל עליו טמא&nbsp;הוא, “and any open vessel which has no covering which closes&nbsp;it tightly on it, is ritually unclean.” In other words, if it had had a&nbsp;tight lid on it, it would not have become ritually unclean. If the&nbsp;outside of this vessel had been in contact with something all&nbsp;day it would need to be broken up completely to dispose of this&nbsp;impurity. It could not have been reinstated as fit for use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואתו תשבות, “</span><span class="font5">and you will have to break it.” The reason is that it had absorbed too much impurity.” Besides, seeing that it&nbsp;is not expensive to replace, the financial loss for the owner is&nbsp;minimal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.34. אשר יבא עליו מים יטמא</span><span class="font5">, “(any food inside it) which has become wet through contact with water has become&nbsp;subject to ritual impurity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah had found it as necessary to spell out the rules governing how different kinds of food or drink and seeds may&nbsp;become subject to ritual contamination until this point. [As long&nbsp;as fruit or grain is on the tree or attached to the soil, no rainfall&nbsp;can contaminate it. Ed.] As soon as it had been mixed with&nbsp;water it became fit as food and seeing that water was no&nbsp;longer connected to its origin, river or pond, liquids other than&nbsp;water when not integral to the fruit from which they have been&nbsp;squeezed, confer basic susceptibility to ritual defilement.&nbsp;Orange juice, etc, while in the orange is therefore not&nbsp;considered as a “liquid” at that stage. Wine, dew, oil, blood,&nbsp;which are not part of their original status anymore are subject&nbsp;to the same rules as water that is no longer part of the earth it&nbsp;came forth from. This is also the reason why the Torah had&nbsp;written: מים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">water</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,” </span><span class="font5">and not כל מים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“any (kind of) water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בכל כלי</span><span class="font5">, “in any such vessel,” the logic is that just as the vessel is no longer attached to the origin from which its&nbsp;craftsman had detached it, so any other material which has&nbsp;been attached from its origin is liable to become a source&nbsp;directly or indirectly of ritual defilement. This rule means that&nbsp;water contained in cisterns and caves is not liable to make the&nbsp;vessels in that airspace subject to ritual defilement as long as&nbsp;they have not been detached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תנור</span><span class="font5">, and an oven for baking bread; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כירים, </span><span class="font5">a kitchen&nbsp;range, for boiling meat, will be considered as having been&nbsp;contaminated and unfit for further use. These vessels are&nbsp;usually made of earthenware [in those days. Ed.] The warning&nbsp;is addressed to both men and women as well as to children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,37. אשר יזרע</span><span class="font5">, “which is to be sown;” which is to take root in the soil. This teaches that even seed which had been&nbsp;ritually impure will be transformed and be ritually clean once it&nbsp;has taken root. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.38. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונפל מנבלתם</span><span class="font5">, “and part of their carcass fell upon&nbsp;them;” not if it fell on bones free from flesh. Teeth and horns&nbsp;and hair are also not included in the definition “carcass.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכי ימות מן הבהמה</span><span class="font5">, “if any beast (of the ones you&nbsp;may eat) dies;” if it dies by a cause other than ritual slaughter;&nbsp;once it has been slaughtered ritually, even if found diseased&nbsp;afterwards and therefore unfit to be eaten, it will not become&nbsp;ritually contaminated. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר היא</span><span class="font5">, this word is spelled with the letter י in the Torah.</span></p>

You cannot argue that instead of repeating&nbsp;the words: את נבלתה a second time, the Torah need only have&nbsp;written the pronoun: “it;” different measurements are applied to&nbsp;what is called “eating,” and what is called “carrying;” therefore&nbsp;the noun “its carcass,” had to be repeated. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)</span></p>

We find more such examples in the Torah,&nbsp;as in Genesis 20,6: מחטו לי, “from sinning against Me, or&nbsp;Numbers 10, 13, צב instead of צבא, as well as Deuteronomy&nbsp;11,12, מרשית instead of מראשית.

The Torah inserted the fowl&nbsp;between the beasts that live on the land and the creatures that&nbsp;inhabit the waters. It was impossible to allow the fowl to be&nbsp;killed regardless of certain rites to make it permissible to be&nbsp;eaten, but on the other hand, the Torah did not want to treat it&nbsp;as it had the mammals. The Rabbis therefore decided that&nbsp;when killing fowls ritually, only one of the vital windpipe and&nbsp;gullet need to be severed in order for the bird to qualify as food&nbsp;for Israelites.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,2 אשה כי תזריע וילדה</span><span class="font5">, “when a woman has fructification of seed and has given birth as a result;” the regulations about&nbsp;to be discussed apply only when she gives birth naturally&nbsp;from the womb, not by caesarean invasive procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Shimon holds that a baby born by caesarean section is considered as having been “born,” and that its&nbsp;mother is obligated to offer the same sacrifices that the&nbsp;mother of a baby born from the womb has to offer. The only&nbsp;difference between such a baby and the one born from the&nbsp;mother’s womb, is that if it is firstborn male, its father does&nbsp;not have to redeem it by paying a priest five shekel. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וילדה</span><span class="font5">, even if the mother gave birth after only between five up to eight months pregnancy, she has to do so, and the&nbsp;restrictive nature of this word means that she has become&nbsp;ritually unclean by giving “birth” to a fetus after five or more&nbsp;months of pregnancy. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וילדה זכר, “</span><span class="font5">and she gave birth to a male;” it, i.e. the prematurely stillborn child is recorded in the Book of&nbsp;offspring. [The source of this statement is extremely&nbsp;nebulous. (Rabbi Chavell) Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to our author, a woman’s body contains seven openings, three on her left side, three on her right&nbsp;side, and one in the center. If her husband’s semen enters&nbsp;via the openings on her right side it will produce a male child.&nbsp;If it enters through the openings on her left side, she will&nbsp;produce a female child. If it enters through the opening in her&nbsp;center she will produce either a hermaphrodite possessing&nbsp;both fully developed masculine and feminine organs, or&nbsp;neither of such organs that are fully developed. Her position&nbsp;in bed shortly after her husband’s ejaculating semen into her&nbsp;determines through which of these openings the semen&nbsp;travels. If she lies on her right side the degree of ritual&nbsp;contamination “evaporates” faster than if she had been lying&nbsp;on her left side; this is why she cannot resume marital&nbsp;relations with have husband or offer her respective sacrifices&nbsp;until this process has run its natural cause. Lying on her left&nbsp;side at that critical juncture slows down the ritual&nbsp;contamination which was the result of the mother having&nbsp;been impregnated with her partners’ semen. This is why the&nbsp;Torah decreed different length of 33 or 66 days before the&nbsp;mother can purify herself. (verses 4-7) The above is hinted at&nbsp;by Solomon in Song of Songs 2,6: שמאלו תחת לראשי</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“with his&nbsp;left hand under my head.” The maid’s lover did this in order&nbsp;to help his partner to give birth to males. [The fact that&nbsp;Solomon who had so many wives and concubines produced&nbsp;only a single male heir is proof that G’d’s active providence&nbsp;overrides nature. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטמאה</span><span class="font5">, “she will be ritually unclean;” the emphasis here is on the suffix ה meaning only the mother, not her child will&nbsp;become ritually unclean as a result of that birth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעת ימים</span><span class="font5">, “for seven days;” in the event that she gave birth to twins or more babies, the count starts at the end of&nbsp;the last birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the students of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai asked him why the Torah decreed different lengths of ritual&nbsp;contamination depending on the sex of the baby, he&nbsp;answered them that the birth of a male baby results in an&nbsp;even greater degree of joy than the birth of a female baby.&nbsp;As a result, the baby’s mother retracts her oath made at the&nbsp;time of enduring the pains during her delivery sooner than&nbsp;after the birth of a daughter, (who is after all also destined to&nbsp;undergo such pain in due course.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נדת</span><span class="font5">, this word is a variant for distance, temporary disassociation, as for instance in Job 18,18: ומתבל ינדוהו, “and&nbsp;chased out of the world.” In our verse the separation is from&nbsp;her husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כימי נדת דותה, </span><span class="font5">“just as she separates from him during the days when she has her menses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baraitha (Niddah,</span><span class="font5"> folio 31) relates that Rabbi Meir explained the reason why generally speaking the period of a&nbsp;woman’s menses lasts seven days, is because if her&nbsp;husband had to abstain from marital relations with her during&nbsp;that period, she will be as desirable for him at the end of that&nbsp;period as she was when he stood with her under the wedding&nbsp;canopy. The woman who just gave birth is familiar with the&nbsp;seven day period during her menses and it is a period she&nbsp;abhors. By reminding her of this comparison, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">she </span><span class="font5">may look&nbsp;forward to having marital relations with her husband again as&nbsp;when pregnant she does not experience the discomfort of&nbsp;her menses. By the same token, this separation also&nbsp;awakens desire in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">her </span><span class="font5">for her husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,3. וביום</span><span class="font5">, “and on the day, etc.;” the reason why the Torah had to write this word is to teach us that if for some&nbsp;reason the circumcision had been delayed beyond the eighth&nbsp;day it must not be performed at night but on the nearest day&nbsp;thereafter possible, except on the Sabbath, as the Sabbath&nbsp;may be desecrated only when the circumcision is performed&nbsp;on the eighth day after birth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וביום השמיני ימול</span><span class="font5">, and on the eighth day the baby is to be circumcised; Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai’s students asked him&nbsp;why that day had been chosen by G’d for circumcision of the&nbsp;newly born; (not sooner) he answered them that this was so&nbsp;that the whole family could rejoice in that celebration, as&nbsp;otherwise the mother of the child could not participate in the&nbsp;joyful activity due to her still being ritually unclean. That day&nbsp;has been described as a joyful occasion in Psalms 119,162:&nbsp;שש אנכי על אמרתך, the psalmist proclaiming “I rejoice over&nbsp;Your promise,” and our sages in the Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 130 understand David as having referred to the&nbsp;day the child is circumcised. On the face of it this is a&nbsp;remarkable statement as one would expect both parents to&nbsp;be saddened by the fact that they cannot indulge in marital&nbsp;relations until then; however as soon as the mother has&nbsp;immersed herself in a ritual bath on the evening after the&nbsp;seventh day, she is free to resume normal relations with her&nbsp;husband. Thus on the eighth day the whole family can&nbsp;rejoice. The reason why this commandment has been&nbsp;repeated is to remind us that it is so important that it be&nbsp;preformed on the eighth day that it overrides the work&nbsp;prohibition on the Sabbath. How then can I deal with the&nbsp;explicit warning that anyone desecrating the Sabbath laws is&nbsp;subject to legal execution? (Exodus 31,14.) Only preparatory&nbsp;activities associated with the circumcision are forbidden even&nbsp;on the Sabbath, whereas the circumcision </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">itself</span><span class="font5"> overrides the&nbsp;Sabbath provided it is performed on the eighth day. (If the&nbsp;baby was born at dusk on Friday evening, the circumcision is&nbsp;deferred until the day after the Sabbath. If there is some&nbsp;doubt about the baby having a proper foreskin, the removal&nbsp;of that is also not performed on the Sabbath. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ימול בשר ערלתו</span><span class="font5">, “the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.” We have learned concerning this procedure as&nbsp;follows in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 137: “a newborn&nbsp;may be legally circumcised on the eighth, ninth or the tenth,&nbsp;the eleventh or the twelfth day, without the father having&nbsp;been remiss in performing the procedure on the correct day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How can this occur? 1) The normal day for mandatory circumcision is the eighth day. 2) the ninth day as the&nbsp;“official” day is when the baby was born at dusk between the&nbsp;seventh and eighth day. If dusk is considered as part of the&nbsp;next day, then the baby cannot be legally circumcised until&nbsp;the morning of the day following, i.e. the ninth day. If that day&nbsp;happens to be the Sabbath, circumcision would have to be&nbsp;delayed for another day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How could it happen that the legal day for the circumcision would not occur until the eleventh of even the&nbsp;twelfth day? If the baby was born at dusk on Friday, and the&nbsp;day following the Sabbath is a festival. If the baby was born&nbsp;at dusk of the end of the twenty-second of Ellul and the&nbsp;following Thursday which would normally be the eighth day is&nbsp;New Year of the following Year and a holiday. As this day&nbsp;however could be the ninth day, both days of New Year as&nbsp;well as Sabbath following are out, so that the earliest legal&nbsp;day would be Sunday, which is the twelfth day after its birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is possible that our author bases himself on a statement attributed in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bereshit Rabbah 7,2,</span><span class="font5"> to someone by&nbsp;the name do Yaakov, resident of Nevorai, who issued a&nbsp;ruling in Tzor, that the son of an idol worshipping woman and&nbsp;a Jewish father, born on the Sabbath, could be circumcised&nbsp;on the Sabbath. When Rabbi Chagai heard about this ruling&nbsp;he ordered this Yaakov to appear before him in order to be&nbsp;punished by lashes for such a ruling. To this Yaakov of&nbsp;Nevorai replied that “when someone gives a correct ruling&nbsp;according to the Torah, why should he be punished by&nbsp;lashes?” Thereupon Rabbi Chagai asked him to explain how&nbsp;his ruling could conform to Torah law. Thereupon Yaakov&nbsp;cited Numbers 1,18: ויתילדו על משפחותם לבית </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אבותם</span><span class="font5">, “they&nbsp;identified themselves according to their families by their&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">fathers’</span><span class="font5"> houses.” To this Rabbi Chagai replied that Yaakov&nbsp;had not interpreted that verse correctly, as it could not&nbsp;override the prohibition against intermarriage with members&nbsp;of an idolatrous nation which is spelled out in Deuteronomy&nbsp;7,3, with the words לא תתחתן בם, “do not intermarry with them&nbsp;(the Canaanites) i.e. since such a union is illegal its offspring&nbsp;is not Jewish. It is also confirmed by Deuteronomy 7,4 where&nbsp;the Torah gives as the reason for such a prohibition: כי יסיר&nbsp;את בנך מאחרי, “for he will lead your son astray from Me;” a&nbsp;reference to your son-in-law. The Torah did not write כי </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">תסיר</span><span class="font5">,&nbsp;for she will lead astray, but “for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">will lead astray.” She&nbsp;cannot lead astray, as she is not Jewish in the first place.&nbsp;Therefore the son of the woman mentioned in the story cited&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bereshit Rabbah,</span><span class="font5"> does not require circumcision on either&nbsp;a weekday or the Sabbath since he does not qualify for&nbsp;performance of that rite until and if he converted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,4. ושלשי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יו</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושלשת ימי</span><span class="font5">ם, “and thirty three days, etc;” the thirty three days plus the first seven days combine to&nbsp;make forty days, the number of days that are required until&nbsp;the male fetus has developed its features. The female fetus&nbsp;requires twice this number of days as has been proven&nbsp;conclusively. (based on the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Niddah</span><span class="font5"> folio 30)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.6</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תביא כבש, </span><span class="font5">“she is to bring a sheep as an offering;”&nbsp;when his students asked Rabbi Shimon why the mother of&nbsp;the baby has to bring an offering, he answered them that it&nbsp;was because during the contractions preceding her giving&nbsp;birth she swore not again to have marital intercourse with her&nbsp;husband which was the reason for the pain she had to&nbsp;endure. This was an inappropriate oath for which she as to&nbsp;atone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל פתח אהל מועד, </span><span class="font5">“to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.” This teaches that the mother herself looks after&nbsp;these birds as well as sheep until then, when she hands&nbsp;them over to the priest. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והקריבו</span><span class="font5">, “and he (the priest) shall offer it;” although&nbsp;the pronoun ending in this word is in the singular mode, i.e.&nbsp;”it,” what is meant is all three creatures, the two birds and the&nbsp;sheep. The Torah also does not bother to spell out the&nbsp;manner in which the birds will be killed, i.e. מליקה, “pinching&nbsp;off of the head, as per Leviticus 5,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,1. אל משה ואל אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “to Moses and to Aaron.” The reason why Aaron has been mentioned here is that it is he,&nbsp;i.e. the priests, who decides if to declare the afflicted person&nbsp;as suffering from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> or not. He decides who is ritually&nbsp;pure and who is not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אדם</span><span class="font5">, a person, i.e. man or woman, minor, male or female.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעור בשרו</span><span class="font5">, “on the skin of his flesh;” as will be explained in greater deal forthwith, i.e. an eczema either on his head or&nbsp;his beard. (compare verse 20) at this point the Torah had to&nbsp;mention the skin of his flesh;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">שאת, an elevation of the skin; when looked at in the shade it appears to the onlooker as if higher that the skin&nbsp;exposed to the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ספחת</span><span class="font5">, an adjective describing the nouns שאת or בהרת. There are subcategories to both שאת and בהרת. An example&nbsp;of nouns that have such adjectives of varying degrees is&nbsp;found in Samuel I 1,37: ספחני נא אל אחת הכהונות, “please&nbsp;attach me to one of the priestly duties.” [Descendants of the&nbsp;High Priest Eli, who had been condemned to become&nbsp;beggars. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לנגע צרעת</span><span class="font5">, “to the plague (similar to) leprosy;” the are of this affliction is white looking flesh. Compare Exodus 4,6&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מצרעת כשלג</span><span class="font5">, “an eczema white as snow.” It is also written:&nbsp;ומראה הנגע עמוק לבן, “the appearance of the eczema is a deep&nbsp;white.” (Source not found)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והובא אל אהרן הכהן</span><span class="font5">, “he is to be brought to Aaron the Priest.” Even against his will, if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או אל אחד מבניו</span><span class="font5">, “or to one of his sons,” even if they are deformed to the degree that they cannot perform sacrificial&nbsp;service in the Temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחד</span><span class="font5">, the letter א has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הכהנים</span><span class="font5">, “the priests;” excluding priests who have defiled themselves by committing certain sins deliberately, so that&nbsp;they have lost their status permanently. How do we know&nbsp;that all the Israelites are included? Answer: from the words&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">or one of,</span><span class="font5">” which includes anyone who is a member of the&nbsp;Jewish people. If so, what is the point of the Torah having&nbsp;written: “from among his sons the priests?” It is to teach you&nbsp;that only the priests can give a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ruling</span><span class="font5"> concerning ritual purity&nbsp;and ritual impurity. Not even the Supreme Court can do so.&nbsp;Are then all priests experts by birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The system works as follows: When the problem of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> arises, someone who has studied the subject is&nbsp;consulted. The priest accepts the superior knowledge of this&nbsp;expert, and makes his ruling based on what he has been told&nbsp;by the expert who has examined the afflicted person. It is&nbsp;irrelevant whether the priest is truly familiar or not with the&nbsp;symptoms the Torah has taught us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושער בנגע הפך לבן, </span><span class="font5">“and the hair in the stricken area&nbsp;has turned from black to white.” This is a sign that the&nbsp;affliction has become stronger and the afflicted area attacks&nbsp;the healthy flesh surrounding it. Elderly people experience&nbsp;that their hair turns white as time progresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, if the hair had turned white already before the area had been declared as a נגע צרעת, white hair is not a sign&nbsp;of ritual impurity, seeing the change in colour had not been&nbsp;related to the skin’s discolouration. This is what our sages&nbsp;had in mind when they said: “when </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">baheret</span><span class="font5"> precedes the&nbsp;manifestation of white hair this is a sign that the person is&nbsp;ritually contaminated; if not, he is ritually pure.” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם בהרת לבנה היא</span><span class="font5">, “but if the bright spot is white on&nbsp;the skin;” but it is not so white that the appearance of the&nbsp;afflicted area is as if recessed under the skin; as is written:&nbsp;“and its hair has not turned white;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועמוק אין מראה, </span><span class="font5">“and its appearance is not deeper, etc.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> writes concerning these words, that he does not&nbsp;understand their meaning. What he meant was: seeing that&nbsp;its appearance as white, how is it possible that it did not look&nbsp;deeper?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators say that the words ועמוק אין מראה mean that its appearance is not like the appearance of skin&nbsp;which has been afflicted with שחין, the plague known from&nbsp;Egypt as the skin breaking out in boils. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Torat Kohanim</span><span class="font5"> on&nbsp;verse 21) This would mean that the affliction while neither&nbsp;lower nor higher, appears as level with the remainder of the&nbsp;skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושערה לא הפך לבן, </span><span class="font5">and the hair which formerly had been black had not turned white; the letter ה in the first word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושערה&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">(here, as opposed to verse 20) does not have the dot that we&nbsp;would have expected if it were to mean: “its appearance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והסגיר הכן</span><span class="font5">, “and the priest will lock him up;” at the end of another seven days the priest will understand if there has&nbsp;been a further expansion of the afflicted area. When&nbsp;someone observes a condition constantly, he would not&nbsp;recognise minor changes; but if he had not looked at that&nbsp;area for a period of seven days, it is much easier to judge if&nbsp;there had been a change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וראהו הכהן ביום השביעי</span><span class="font5">, “when the priest looks at it&nbsp;on the seventh day;” he does not wait a whole seven days&nbsp;before inspecting the affliction again. From this verse we&nbsp;learn the principle that in the Torah even part of a day is&nbsp;considered as if it were a whole day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עמד בעיניו</span><span class="font5">, “has remained unchanged;” the area that had been strongly inflamed had not weakened, and the areas that&nbsp;had been relatively mildly inflamed had not become more&nbsp;inflamed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעת ימים שנית </span><span class="font5">“a second period of seven days of waiting.” The first “seventh” day, counts as a whole day in&nbsp;both directions. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והנה כהה הנגע ולא פשה הנגע בעור וטהרו</span><span class="font5">, “and behold, if&nbsp;the plague had dimmed and the plague had not spread;” the&nbsp;priest declares the afflicted person as ritually pure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask why the Torah appears to repeat itself, seeing that it is obvious that if the symptoms had not&nbsp;spread, and the afflicted person is declared ritually pure, then&nbsp;if the symptoms had diminished he must </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">certainly</span><span class="font5"> be&nbsp;declared ritually pure? You have to understand the words:&nbsp;ולא פשה, “and it did not spread,” as applying to the result of&nbsp;the priest’s inspection after the first seven days. When at the&nbsp;second inspection it turned out that not only had the affliction&nbsp;not spread but it had even diminished, only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">then</span><span class="font5"> does the&nbsp;priest declare that person as ritually pure, i.e. as cured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not possible to understand the words: “the afflicted area did not increase” as applying to the second period of&nbsp;seven days because </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> there had explained already that&nbsp;as long as the afflicted person had not been healed he&nbsp;remains not only potentially ritually impure, but he remains&nbsp;absolutely ritually impure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the healing process, i.e. the afflicted person’s progress toward ritual purity, the second inspection,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> says clearly that the appearance of the affliction, i.e.&nbsp;that it had not diminished, is proof that he remains impure&nbsp;(pending) and if it had spread he is definitively impure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning his ritual purity, the Torah writes: (14,3) והנה </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">נרפא</span><span class="font5"> נגע הצרעת מן הצרוע, “and behold if the plague of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">that the afflicted person suffers from has been healed;” as&nbsp;soon as this has occurred the afflicted person can leave the&nbsp;place where he had been locked up, i.e. even though his&nbsp;symptoms have not disappeared. All that is required is that&nbsp;on the second inspection after the second period of seven&nbsp;days the symptoms have not spread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנה כהה הנגע</span><span class="font5">, “and behold the symptoms of the affliction have diminished;” even though one might have thought that&nbsp;any change [even for the better,] is proof of a new affliction,&nbsp;and that the person would be declared as ritually&nbsp;contaminates; in order to forestall such erroneous thinking,&nbsp;the Torah added the word: והנה, “and lo and behold!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטהרו</span><span class="font5">, “he [the examining priest Ed] declares him as ritually pure.” He does so by making this declaration by&nbsp;mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכבס בגדיו, </span><span class="font5">the now ritually pure person will immerse his clothing, [seeing that they had become contaminated by his&nbsp;having worn them in his state of the plague, Ed.] Naturally, if&nbsp;he had to immerse his clothing, it is understood that he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">also&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">has to immerse his body in a ritual bath, (seeing there had&nbsp;been doubt if he had remained pure during the period when&nbsp;he had been locked up he might not have not been careful&nbsp;not to become ritually unclean in a way unrelated to his&nbsp;plague) following this, the process of purification is complete,</span></p>
<p dir="rtl"><span class="font5">.וטהר</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,7. ואם פשה תפשה אחרי הראותו</span><span class="font5">, “but if the scab spread after he had shown it to the priest, even immediately;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיא הפכה</span><span class="font5">, “and it had changed colour;” the word&nbsp;והיא here is spelled with the letter י and not with the letter ו;&nbsp;[as in verses 4,7 and 8. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;צרעת נושנת היא</span><span class="font5">, “it is an old plague,” it had only&nbsp;appeared to have healed by new skin covering it. Beneath&nbsp;that new skin the flesh had remained raw and moist. The&nbsp;Torah had to inform us of this so that we would not think that&nbsp;the surface of the skin is the only determining factor. That is&nbsp;not enough for the priest to declare the afflicted person as&nbsp;ritually pure. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,12. ואם פרוח תפרח</span><span class="font5">, “if these symptoms show up in different parts of his skin;” if different parts of his skin seem&nbsp;to break out in white spots as if flowering;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מראשו</span><span class="font5">, “from his head down;” not on his head;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועד רגליו, </span><span class="font5">“all the way down to his feet;” excluding the feet themselves;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכל מראה עיני הכהן</span><span class="font5">, “as far as it appears to the priest’s eyes;” this excludes a priest whose eyesight is defective;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi)</span><span class="font5"> Why did the Torah only exclude a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">priest</span><span class="font5"> who has&nbsp;defective eyesight?, Why did it not also prohibit such&nbsp;inspections on a very cloudy day when </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">everyone’s</span><span class="font5"> vision is&nbsp;impaired? This did not have to be spelled out as it is logical.&nbsp;(Compare verse 5) where the word: בעיניו, “as it appears to&nbsp;his eyes,” has already implied that any impediment to the&nbsp;priest seeing clearly prevents such an inspection from being&nbsp;performed and to have legal validity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the words above mean that the inspection must be performed in parts of the body which&nbsp;are clearly visible, not in the armpits, private parts, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In connection with this our Rabbis coined the saying: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">האיש נראה כעודר ומוסק זיתים, והאשה כעורכת ומיניקה את </span><span class="font5">בנה, “a&nbsp;man looks as if busy picking olives, whereas the woman&nbsp;appears as if getting ready to nurse her son.” These are&nbsp;similes describing when normally hidden folds in one’s skin&nbsp;become exposed due to the nature of that person’s activity.&nbsp;[The Rabbis used elegant language to refer to respective&nbsp;private parts of men and women. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;צרעת הוא</span><span class="font5">, “it is the affliction we have been&nbsp;discussing.” The reason why the Torah here uses the&nbsp;masculine pronoun is that it refers to בשר חי in verse 10 which&nbsp;is masculine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;או כי ישוב</span><span class="font5">, “or the raw flesh reverses its&nbsp;appearance, etc.” this refers to what the Torah had described&nbsp;in verses 10-15, especially in verse 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או כי ישוב</span><span class="font5">, “refers to the extremities of the limbs like the tips of fingers or toes which had alternately becoming visible&nbsp;as normal and as diseased. [The Torah had taught in verse&nbsp;13 that if the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">entire</span><span class="font5"> surface of someone’s skin is afflicted,&nbsp;such a person is ritually </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">pure</span><span class="font5">. It follows therefore that when&nbsp;the healing process begins, some skin will no longer be&nbsp;afflicted, i.e. he will </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">then</span><span class="font5"> have to become ritually unclean&nbsp;when the priest sees this and acknowledges it. I have added&nbsp;this, as not all my readers may have paid attention to the&nbsp;verses not dealt with by our author as he assumed that his&nbsp;audience was familiar with them. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והנה מראה שפל</span><span class="font5">, “and behold its appearance is as if&nbsp;lower than the skin’s surface;” How do we know that what is&nbsp;true for the appearance remaining level with the skin&nbsp;adjoining it is treated by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachah</span><span class="font5"> as the same as if it&nbsp;appears raised? To teach us this, the Torah wrote: ושפלה&nbsp;איננה מן העור, “but it does not appear lower than the rest of the&nbsp;skin.” (verse 21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושפלה איננה מן העור והיא כהה</span><span class="font5">, “and it does not&nbsp;appear to be lower than the skin surrounding it;” why did the&nbsp;Torah have to write the words: והיא כהה, “and it has&nbsp;diminished in intensity?” The reason is because we have had&nbsp;that same expression used when the priest made his second&nbsp;examination. (verse 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand this expression as referring to the word: איננה; we find a similar construction in&nbsp;Psalms 9,19: תקות ענוים תאבד לעד, “the hope of the afflicted&nbsp;will not forever be lost.” [This line must not be understood as&nbsp;a positive statement, instead as a plaintive question or&nbsp;reassurance that “of course this hope will not be lost forever.&nbsp;“ Ed.] The verse should therefore be understood as follows:&nbsp;“even though the symptom of the affected skin does not&nbsp;appear lower than that surrounding it, but the intensity of the&nbsp;discoloration has not diminished, this is sufficient reason for&nbsp;the priest to place the person in isolation, even if the hair in&nbsp;that area has not turned white; in other words, if the intensity&nbsp;of the discoloration did diminish, it is clear that the person&nbsp;afflicted will be declared ritually pure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיא כהה, </span><span class="font5">here too the word: והיא, is spelled with the letter י before the letter א, just as in verse 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נגע הוא</span><span class="font5">, “it is a plague.” The word הנא is read as&nbsp;having the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik.</span><span class="font5"> It is in the feminine mode as it&nbsp;describes either the word: בהרת or שאת, both of which are&nbsp;feminine nouns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם תחתיה תעמוד הבהרת</span><span class="font5">, “but if the bright spot&nbsp;stays unchanged in its place;” even though it did not&nbsp;diminish, the afflicted person is declared as ritually pure,&nbsp;seeing the cause of the affliction had been the rising on the&nbsp;skin of the boil, or the burns that that person had suffered; as&nbsp;long as the area of the plague had not increased in size it is&nbsp;not a fully fledged plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.24. או בשר</span><span class="font5">, “or when flesh, etc.;” there is no difference between how </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachah</span><span class="font5"> treats either a burn on the&nbsp;skin or a boil caused through internal swelling. The reason,&nbsp;why in spite of this, the Torah appears to treat it as two&nbsp;different phenomena, is because it wishes to teach that if&nbsp;either of these phenomena are present in smaller sizes than&nbsp;the minimum size to qualify as a plague, these two&nbsp;phenomena combined are not to be considered as big&nbsp;enough combined to result in our viewing them as evidence&nbsp;of a plague. This has been stated in the Talmud, tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 8. The minimum size is half the size of a certain&nbsp;kind of bean known as פנל.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.25. ומראה עמוק מן העור</span><span class="font5">, “and its appearance is as if deeper than the skin;” how do we know that when it appears&nbsp;as level with the surrounding skin or higher that the same&nbsp;rule applies? This is why the Torah had added in verse 21:&nbsp;ושפלה איננה, “but not lower than the surrounding skin;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא פשתה בעור והיא כהה</span><span class="font5">, “it had not spread on the&nbsp;skin, and had become dimmer in appearance;” the word כהה&nbsp;is used as complementing the words לא פשתה, i.e. “it had not&nbsp;spread and not become dimmer.” (Compare our commentary&nbsp;on verse 21 in connection with שחין</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואיש או אשה כי יהיה בו נגע בראש</span><span class="font5">, “and a man or a</span></h1>

Therefore, when yellow hair appears it&nbsp;is a sure sign that the flesh beneath it is dead and weak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דק</span><span class="font5">, “thin;” as a result, any hair that grows on that skin is also weaker and the growth is less dense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נתק</span><span class="font5">, “it is a scall;” the area on which hair grows is called נתק, the word being a derivative of the verb לנתק, “to tear out,”&nbsp;or “tear apart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכי יראה, </span><span class="font5">same as אם יראה, “if or when he sees.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.33.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והתגלח, “he shall shave;” seeing that we find&nbsp;“shaving” also in connection with the priest when it is being&nbsp;performed by himself, (Leviticus 21,5), I might have thought&nbsp;that the person that had been afflicted with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> would&nbsp;also have to do this himself, the Torah employs the reflexive&nbsp;mode to show that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">anyone</span><span class="font5"> can perform this procedure. He&nbsp;may use any means, not only a razor to perform this removal&nbsp;of hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והתגלח</span><span class="font5">, “he is to be shaved;” even if he is a Nazirite, and his term of being such has not yet expired. [Nazirites are&nbsp;forbidden to shave their hair. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת הנתק לא יגלח</span><span class="font5">, “but he must not shave off the scall;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands this to mean that he must leave at last&nbsp;two hairs in place so that it can be determined if the area of&nbsp;the scall has expanded. The only way the status of the scall&nbsp;can be judged is by hairs</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.34. וכבס בגדיו וטהר</span><span class="font5">, “and after having immersed his&nbsp;garments in a ritual bath he shall be ritually pure.” He will not&nbsp;confer ritual impurity through touch lying or sitting on&nbsp;something or having marital relations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטהר</span><span class="font5">, he will also become ritually pure (if he is a Nazirite) although as such he should have let his hair grow&nbsp;wild, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,37. ושער שחור צמח בו</span><span class="font5">, “and black hair had grown on it.” The letter ו at the beginning of the word: ושער is not&nbsp;conjunctive, but means “or.” Examples of similar uses of the&nbsp;letter ו are found in Exodus 21,15: מכה אביו ואמו, “if someone&nbsp;strikes father or mother;” and in Exodus 12,5: מן הכבשים ומן&nbsp;העזים תקחו, “you are to take from the goats or from the sheep;&nbsp;here too the words ושער mean: או שער, or black hair (grew).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">טהור הוא</span><span class="font5">, “he is ritually pure;” the reason is that the plague has not changed for the worse, or that growth of black&nbsp;hair proves that the follicle it grew out of is healthy, and the&nbsp;flesh surrounding it has not become weaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,40. ואיש כי ימרט ראשו</span><span class="font5">, “or if a man loses the hair on his head;” baldness of women is not mentioned here seeing&nbsp;that her head does not become bald. (Talmud, tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nedarim</span><span class="font5"> folio 30)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איש, </span><span class="font5">from the fact that the Torah speaks only of איש, “a man,” how do we know that the same law applies to both&nbsp;women and minors? We know this from the superfluous word&nbsp;צרוע in verse 44. We know that this term applies to every&nbsp;category of human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.44. איש צרוע</span><span class="font5">, “he is a man afflicted with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat;”</span><span class="font5"> all the rules discussed in this chapter affecting such people&nbsp;apply to what follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.45. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והצרוע</span><span class="font5">, “and the so afflicted person;” even if he&nbsp;happens to be the High Priest of whom it has been written in&nbsp;the Torah (Leviticus 21,10) that he must not let his hair grow&nbsp;loose nor rend his garments [as signs of mourning, Ed.]&nbsp;when faced with the problem discussed here he must ignore&nbsp;what is written in chapter 21. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בגדיו יהיו פרומים</span><span class="font5">, “his clothes shall be rent;” this will serve as a symbol that he mourns over his errors which led to him&nbsp;becoming afflicted. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועל שפם יעטה</span><span class="font5">, “and he shall cover his upper lip.” This is to stop bad smell coming forth from his mouth which might&nbsp;affect people negatively. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.46. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בדד ישב, </span><span class="font5">“he must dwell in isolation;” he must not&nbsp;have marital relations, as doing this would cause rot.&nbsp;(Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moed Katan,</span><span class="font5"> folio 7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מחוץ למחנה מושבו</span><span class="font5">, “his residence must be beyond the boundaries of the camp.” His residence itself is ritually&nbsp;impure;” the disease from which he suffers is contagious to&nbsp;people who conduct social intercourse with him. This is the&nbsp;source for the statement in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5"> here that if a ritually&nbsp;unclean person sits under a tree and a ritually clean person&nbsp;stands in front of him (under the branches), the previously&nbsp;ritually clean person has become ritually contaminated. If the&nbsp;situation is reversed, the ritually pure person remains ritually&nbsp;pure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,47. מחוץ למחנה מושבו, והבגד</span><span class="font5">, “his residence must be outside the camp. “And the garment;” [in spite of verse 46&nbsp;being the conclusion of a paragraph Ed.], Rabbi Yossi from&nbsp;the Galil, claims that we learn from these two verses that the&nbsp;afflicted person’s clothes also require to be quarantined with&nbsp;him. [Possibly he disregarded the end of the paragraph, as&nbsp;the new paragraph commences with the conjunctive letter ו&nbsp;alerting us to the fact that this verse belongs together with&nbsp;the one preceding it. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בבגד צמר או בבגד פשתים</span><span class="font5">, “whether it be a woolen or a linen garment;” when the Torah speaks of garments, we always&nbsp;hear of woolen garments before linen garments are&nbsp;mentioned. The reason is that once a woolen garment has&nbsp;been completed, it is worth more than a linen garment. When&nbsp;the Torah speaks of a warp or a woof (in weaving) it always&nbsp;mentions linen before wool. The reason is that a woven linen&nbsp;garment is more valuable than a woven garment made of&nbsp;wool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,48.או בשתי</span><span class="font5">, “or in the warp;” the word שתי is not a genitive, construct mode, but a word in its own right, meaning&nbsp;“foundation”. Compare Psalms 11,3: השתות, “the&nbsp;foundations;” the reason is that the warp is the basis of all&nbsp;manner of weaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או בערב</span><span class="font5">, “or in the woof;” the word is so called as it mixes the threads that have to be woven together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,55. בקרחתו או בגבחו</span><span class="font5">, “whether the bareness be within or without.” These words refer to either the garment or the&nbsp;hide. It is similar to when people who come from a hairy&nbsp;region “baldy,” whereas they do the reverse with people&nbsp;coming from a region of smooth skinned people, “hairy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,58. וכבס שנית</span><span class="font5">, “it shall be immersed in a ritual bath a second time.” The second time in order to purify it, whereas&nbsp;the first time was in order to remove the residue of the&nbsp;plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,59 לטהרו או לטמאו</span><span class="font5">, “to declare him purified or contaminated.”</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Metzora</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,2. ביום טהרתו</span><span class="font5">, “on the day of his purification;” this teaches that his state of defilement, purification, the&nbsp;slaughtering of the birds, and the sprinkling of their blood, as&nbsp;well as his being shaved, all take place on the same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום טהרתו</span><span class="font5">, this also teaches that he is not to tarry in performing these rites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והובא אל הכהן</span><span class="font5">, “after he had been purified he shall be brought to the priest;” while still outside the camp, but where&nbsp;the priest can inspect him without undue discomfort. We&nbsp;know that the afflicted person could not yet have entered the&nbsp;confines of the camp from what is written immediately&nbsp;following, i.e. that the priest had to leave the camp in order to&nbsp;perform his duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the words: “and he was brought to the priest,” mean that he had to be brought to the&nbsp;priest because he was still resident outside the camp, so that&nbsp;he had to be brought to the boundary. The priest on his part&nbsp;came as near as he could in order to meet him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצא הכהן אל מחוץ למחנה</span><span class="font5">, “and a ritually pure priest left the camp as he could re-enter the camp, and he performed the&nbsp;purification rites. The fact that the Torah wrote: “the priest left&nbsp;the camp,” proves that he must have been ritually pure else&nbsp;what enabled this priest to return to the camp otherwise? A&nbsp;ritually contaminated priest could not enter the camp, so how&nbsp;could he perform </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">the rites? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנה נרפא</span><span class="font5">, “and behold the plague had been healed.” It had vanished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">נ</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גע</span><span class="font5">, “the white hair had disappeared;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הצרעת</span><span class="font5">, the raw flesh had disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן הצרוע</span><span class="font5">, “from the person who had been afflicted with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat.</span><span class="font5"> Not a trace was left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,4. ולקח למטהר</span><span class="font5">, “he will take for the one who was to be purified;” the word מטהר includes man, woman or minor as&nbsp;the case maybe. This wording prompted the sages to coin&nbsp;the phrase: לקח לאיש, כשרות לאשתו, “when weddings are&nbsp;performed publicly it is a public demonstration of the chastity&nbsp;of both partners, as if they had wished they could have&nbsp;married one another in the privacy of their homes legally. [I&nbsp;have abbreviated the saying. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שתי צפרים</span><span class="font5">, “two birds;” whenever there is a reference to a bird as צפור, it is a ritually pure bird. Rabbi Yitzchok says that&nbsp;a ritually pure bird may be referred to as either עוף or צפור,&nbsp;whereas a ritually impure bird is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">always</span><span class="font5"> referred to as עוף.&nbsp;(Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> folio 139)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">טהורות</span><span class="font5">, “ritually pure;” both genetically, and free from physical defects. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Malbim)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועץ ארז</span><span class="font5">, “and some cedar wood;” according to Rabbi Chanina ben Gamliel, the leaves from the cedar tree were&nbsp;torn from the top of the tree. [In order that the tallest of plants&nbsp;and the lowliest, i.e. hyssop, both be part of this offering. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,5. וצוה הכהן ושחט, </span><span class="font5">“and the priest issues the order to slaughter. The </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">order</span><span class="font5"> had to be given by a priest, whereas it&nbsp;could be executed by any ordinary Israelite. (According to&nbsp;Rabbi Yehudah in the name of Rabbi Yossi.) Some sages&nbsp;disagree that an ordinary Israelite could perform the act of&nbsp;slaughtering in this instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושחט את הצפור האחת</span><span class="font5">, “the superior looking one of the two birds.” (Based on the prefix ה before the word (אחת</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על מים חיים</span><span class="font5">, “over running water,” (from a spring, not a tap.) The symbolism here is to show that the dead-like&nbsp;person who had been afflicted, was now on the way back&nbsp;and could take his place among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על מים חיים</span><span class="font5">, this spring water was to mix with the blood of the bird which had been slaughtered, so that the hyssop and&nbsp;the leaves from the cedar tree could be dipped in that&nbsp;mixture with the crimson wool and the living bird.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,6. ואת הצפור החיה בדם</span><span class="font5">, “together with the living bird in the blood of;” this was so that the living bird before being&nbsp;released had been dyed the colour of the slaughtered bird’s&nbsp;blood; the other birds of the same subspecies will look at it&nbsp;and will know that it had changed colours (allegorically&nbsp;speaking had become impure) and gang up on it and kill it so&nbsp;that they themselves will not be found as afflicted with the&nbsp;disease of the now healed victim. They are afraid of being&nbsp;chosen as sacrifices for another person afflicted with the&nbsp;same disease. (This strange sounding paragraph is found in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tossaphot.</span><span class="font5"> The idea of releasing a living bird in order that it be killed by its mates sounds somewhat puzzling.) Seeing&nbsp;that the Torah in verse 20 writes that this whole procedure as&nbsp;outlined in the verses following, is designed to achieve&nbsp;atonement עליו, i.e. only for the person of which we have&nbsp;been reading, if the bird that had been released would return,&nbsp;the affliction would also return and the person who had&nbsp;brought all these sacrifices would not have become ritually&nbsp;pure. If proof would be needed that this statement is indeed&nbsp;correct, i.e. that the mates of that bird that has changed&nbsp;colour by having been dunked in blood will kill it or devour it,&nbsp;our sages quote Jeremiah 12,9 as saying in the name of G’d:&nbsp;העיט צבוע נחלתי לי התיו לאכלה, “My heritage has become like a&nbsp;speckled bird, the birds around it are against her ready to&nbsp;devour her!” this simile appears completely inappropriate as&nbsp;the Torah had never spoken about an עיט, “a speckled bird.”&nbsp;It must therefore be a bird which because it had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">changed&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">colour, cannot be recognised for what it had been like&nbsp;originally. The Talmud argues that surely the Torah would&nbsp;not have instructed this live bird to be released if the intention&nbsp;had been that it should be killed! (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kidushin&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 57) [Remember that we had learned that any bird&nbsp;referred to as צפור is automatically permitted to become an&nbsp;instrument to lead someone into sin, especially a bird that is&nbsp;permitted to be eaten, so how did Jeremiah quote G’d as&nbsp;saying that it has become a forbidden bird, עיט. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,7. שבע פעמים</span><span class="font5">;” seven times.” This bird’s blood was to&nbsp;be sprinkled on the back of the hand of the afflicted person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטהרו</span><span class="font5">, “and pronounce him ritually pure;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושלח את הצפור החיה</span><span class="font5">, “whereupon he is to send off the living bird;” this is a symbol of the purity signifying that the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> has “flown off” the owner of these birds who had&nbsp;suffered the affliction. The allegorical meaning is that&nbsp;whereas previously the owner of this bird had sat on the roof&nbsp;of a house (i.e. homeless and exposed to all kinds of danger,&nbsp;seeing that he had been forbidden any contact with human&nbsp;society, now he had miraculously been re-admitted to&nbsp;civilization and all its advantages.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,9. והיה ביום השביעי יגלח</span><span class="font5">, and as soon as the seventh day has come, he will shave all his hair. The reference is to&nbsp;hair that has grown during the preceding seven days. There&nbsp;are two occasions when shaving has to occur. He has to&nbsp;perform two separate shavings;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את כל שערו את ראשו, </span><span class="font5">“all the hair on his head;” but when the Torah prescribes the Levites as having to shave off their&nbsp;hair, it requires only the eyelids and eyebrows and their body&nbsp;hair. (Numbers 8,7). The purpose there is for cosmetic&nbsp;purposes. Usually they only shave off excess hair and they&nbsp;leave most of it. If they had been asked to remove all their&nbsp;body hair they would present themselves as practically&nbsp;naked in the Presence of the glory of G’d;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">People who had been afflicted with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> on the other hand, would have been asked to remove the whole </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">skin</span><span class="font5"> over&nbsp;their flesh if they would be able to survive such a procedure.&nbsp;The Torah, therefore, does not ask this of them, but is&nbsp;content with a symbolic procedure. It only wants to ensure&nbsp;that all the symptoms of their affliction have been removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת כל שערו, </span><span class="font5">“and all of his hair;” what is the meaning of these words? Why does the Torah repeats this instruction? It&nbsp;is to emphasise the critical importance of this procedure and&nbsp;its date. It must be performed on the seventh day, not on the&nbsp;eighth or ninth or tenth day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,10-11. שני כבשים</span><span class="font5">, “two male sheep;” one is to be a burnt offering, i.e. the priests do not get to eat any of it, and&nbsp;neither does the owner,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכבשה אחת</span><span class="font5">, “and one female sheep;” this is to be a sin offering, to be treated like any regular sin offering. This&nbsp;sacrifice will be accompanied by a libation consisting of three&nbsp;tenths parts of an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eyphah</span><span class="font5"> of fine flour for a meal offering&nbsp;mixed with oil and one log of oil;</span></p>

I might&nbsp;have thought that placing the blood on the altar should be&nbsp;performed by some specially designated vessel such as a&nbsp;spoon or something like it. To prevent us from thinking this,&nbsp;the Torah repeats the word הכהן where it did not appear to&nbsp;have been necessary, and adds that the procedure for the&nbsp;sin offering is the same as that for the guilt offering. There&nbsp;were two priests needed for this whole procedure; the first&nbsp;would sprinkle the blood, and the second priest would have&nbsp;to hold the vessel into which the blood had first been poured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,16. וטבל הכהן</span><span class="font5">, “the priest would dip, etc.” from the oil,”&nbsp;the word מ! השמן used here mans “into the oil.” We could&nbsp;have expected the Torah to have written בשמן instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטבל ...והזה</span><span class="font5">, every time the priest sprinkled from the oil he first dipped his finger in the oil again.</span></p>

What the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">right</span><span class="font5"> hand or finger&nbsp;does is always more visible than what the left hand does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על דם האשם, </span><span class="font5">“on the blood of the guilt offering. ”(verse 17) which had been placed there before, (verse 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והנותר בשמן</span><span class="font5">, “and the rest of the oil;” we would&nbsp;have expected the Torah to have written: מן השמן instead of&nbsp;בשמן. [Whenever our author makes this kind of succinct&nbsp;comment, it is to remind the reader that we are not dealing&nbsp;with a scribe‘s error that need to be emended, but that the&nbsp;Torah had its own reasons for changing the syntax as well as&nbsp;spelling. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את החטאת</span><span class="font5">, “the sin offering.” This refers to the&nbsp;female sheep, ewe; the details of the guilt offering have&nbsp;already been dealt with.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת המנחה</span><span class="font5">, “and the meal-offering;” the three&nbsp;partial fistfuls of fine flour separated from the original quantity&nbsp;of three tenths of an eypha of fine flour that we read about in&nbsp;verse 10 that were to be eaten by the priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם דל הוא ואין ידו משגת</span><span class="font5">, “and if the afflicted person&nbsp;is poor and cannot afford (the price of the sheep);” we&nbsp;usually find the adjective דל in connection with the body, as in&nbsp;the case of the cows that Pharaoh saw in the dream he told&nbsp;Joseph about in Genesis 41,19. Compare also: “happy he&nbsp;who is happy when he gives his attention to the poor.”&nbsp;Psalms 41,2: משכיל אל דל,“ or Samuel II 13,4: מדוע אתה ככה דל&nbsp;בן המלך, “why are you so poorly, son of a king?!” In none of&nbsp;these examples does the word דל describe one’s financial&nbsp;status. This is why in our verse the Torah had to add the&nbsp;words: “for he cannot afford;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,31. על המנחה</span><span class="font5">, “in addition to the meal-offering.”</span></p>

When&nbsp;speaking about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> afflicting houses it did write these&nbsp;words of introduction, as that plague only occurs in the land&nbsp;of Israel. [Besides they only had tents there no houses built&nbsp;of stone. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different explanation: the reason why when a plague breaks out on a house it must be destroyed, is that the earth&nbsp;of the land of Israel is holy, and its earth does not gladly&nbsp;suffer ritual contamination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתתי נגע צרעת</span><span class="font5">, “and I put the plague of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> on a house in the land of your inheritance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to some commentators, reading the plain text, this line has to be understood in conjunction with&nbsp;Deuteronomy 12,2: אבד תאבדון את כל המקומות אשר עבדו שם&nbsp;הגוים, “you must destroy utterly every place where the&nbsp;gentiles have worshipped (idols).” How are we to know in&nbsp;which locations the Canaanites once worshipped idols?&nbsp;Answer: the plague that shows up on your house is an&nbsp;indication that this was a house which served such a&nbsp;purpose. It alerts us to the need to fulfill that commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר לו הבית</span><span class="font5">, “to whom this house belongs, after&nbsp;the Israelites have conquered the land of Canaan. Everyone&nbsp;by then knows which house is his house. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,37. וראה את הנגע והנה הנגע בקירות הבית</span><span class="font5">, “and he sees&nbsp;that the plague has struck the walls of the house. The&nbsp;repetition of the word נגע in this verse led our Rabbis to&nbsp;understand that the minimum size of such a plague on a&nbsp;house is two גריסין, [surface of a large bean. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.40. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וחלצו את האבנים</span><span class="font5">, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> shall remove the stones&nbsp;concerned;” from the plural mode of the verb וחלצו, we learn&nbsp;that at least two people are required to remove these stones.&nbsp;This is the source of the proverb: “woe to the wicked as well&nbsp;as to his neighbour.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.41. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יקציע ....הקצו</span><span class="font5">, “they will scrape off;” this root&nbsp;appears again in verse 43 and it means the same there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.42. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יקח וטח</span><span class="font5">, from the use of the singular mode of this&nbsp;verb here we learn that the friend of the owner of the house&nbsp;does not help in this procedure of replacing the stones with&nbsp;mortar. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.43.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The verse refers to the re-appearance of the&nbsp;plague after seven days have elapsed since the symptoms&nbsp;and the afflicted stones have been removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our author states that he copied </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> entire commentary on this verse, in order to enable the reader to&nbsp;fully understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“after having been scraped off</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">this is inferred from the similarity of the verb: “if the plague recurs,” אם ישוב הנגע ופרח.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I might have thought that if the plague recurs immediately after having been scraped off, the house would&nbsp;be declared as ritually contaminated with all the&nbsp;consequences thereof. The Torah wrote: “the priest returns,&nbsp;etc.;” in order to make plain that this occurs only after an&nbsp;interval of seven days, just as in the case of a priest reexamining the symptoms of a plague on the skin of a person&nbsp;so afflicted. (13,32). Moreover, unless in the interval the area&nbsp;afflicted with these symptoms had expanded, the house will&nbsp;not be declared as ritually contaminated. (verse 44) We find&nbsp;the expression צרעת ממארת, “a malignant </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,”</span><span class="font5"> In&nbsp;connection with houses as well as in connection with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">on clothing; (13,52) here too the reappearance of the&nbsp;symptoms of the plague that had been removed is sufficient&nbsp;for the house to be declared as having been ritually&nbsp;contaminated, even if the area of the contamination had not&nbsp;become larger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Actually, this is not the place where we would have expected to read this verse. What are we to learn from the&nbsp;words (verse 44) “the area covered by the symptoms of the&nbsp;plague has expanded,” seeing that the verdict of the priest&nbsp;will be no different? That verse should have been written&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">before </span><span class="font5">verse 43, and </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">then</span><span class="font5"> the next verse would have taught&nbsp;us that even if the area had not increased the priest would&nbsp;still order the tearing down of the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must therefore assume that verse 44 speaks of the priest having come for another inspection at the end of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">second </span><span class="font5">week. The proper place for our verse actually is after&nbsp;verse 47, where we are taught that people who had used that&nbsp;house to dwell in and go about their normal activities have to&nbsp;retroactively treat what they wear, their food supplies, their&nbsp;furniture, etc. as having been contaminated since the&nbsp;departure of the priest the previous time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[I am taking the liberty to abbreviate here and draw the reader’s attention to the fact that the Torah had warned the&nbsp;inhabitants of that house to empty it out before his return&nbsp;(verse 36). The inhabitants have now incurred additional&nbsp;financial loss because they had ignored the priest’s warning.&nbsp;If -until the next visit of the priest- the symptoms of the&nbsp;plague had </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">come back after they had been scraped of&nbsp;and new plaster had been applied to that area, the priest will&nbsp;declare it as ritually pure, and will take two birds, etc., on&nbsp;behalf of the owner and slaughter one of them, etc. and&nbsp;release the second one into the air, as described in verse 4953. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> principal contribution here is that the expressions used by the Torah for the priest’s visit to the&nbsp;house, once described as ביאה, “coming,” and once as שבה,&nbsp;“returning,” are not chosen randomly, but are to draw our&nbsp;attention to the results of each visit by the priest, depending&nbsp;on the choice of words used by the Torah to describe them,&nbsp;being basically similar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,46. </span><span class="font5">כל ימי הסגיר אותו, during all the days that he had sealed it; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> we have to understand the&nbsp;word: ימי</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">as excluding the days when the owner had scraped</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">off the symptoms. Those days actually overlapped after the priest had sealed the house. [There is disagreement among&nbsp;the commentators as to what happens to people who enter&nbsp;the sealed house between the inspections. Some&nbsp;commentators feel that third parties who did not own nor live&nbsp;in that house would not be penalised by becoming ritually&nbsp;impure, i.e. that all the yardsticks applied are subjective;&nbsp;others feel that entering such a house, seeing it was sealed&nbsp;make such persons ritually impure even if eventually the&nbsp;house was declared as ritually pure by the priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[According to at least one opinion in the Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sanhedrin 71)</span><span class="font5"> it never got to the point when such a house&nbsp;had to be torn down. In light of this, this editor has decided&nbsp;not to pursue the subject further, seeing that our author does&nbsp;not offer an opinion of his own but only quotes&nbsp;commentators. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is clear from verses 46-48 is that merely entering that house during the period it is sealed, results in a very&nbsp;brief state of ritual impurity not even requiring immersion in a&nbsp;ritual bath, but requiring only sunset, whereas sleeping in&nbsp;that house requires a more elaborate ritual before such a&nbsp;person becomes ritually pure again, i.e. immersion in a ritual&nbsp;bath of both his body and the clothes he wore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,48. וטהר הכהן את הבית</span><span class="font5">, “the priest purifies the house.” He does so by means of a verbal declaration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,53. את הצפור החיה אל מחוץ לעיר</span><span class="font5">, “the living bird outside the boundaries of the city;” according to Rabbi Yossi Haglili,&nbsp;this bird had had its “residence” outside the city; in other&nbsp;words, it is not a bird that was domesticated and for which&nbsp;the owners had provided a שובך, dove-cot.” It was by&nbsp;definition a “free roaming bird.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכפר על הבית וטהר</span><span class="font5">, “by doing so he makes atonement for the house and it is (again) ritually pure.” The ritual is&nbsp;analogous to that of the scapegoat on the day of Atonement&nbsp;that carries the sins of the Jewish people into the wilderness.&nbsp;(Nachmanides)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If atonement is required for the afflicted house why only for the house that had such an affliction? Why not for the&nbsp;person whose skin had been afflicted? The answer is that&nbsp;one cannot take a house to a ritual bath, and the house&nbsp;cannot bring a sacrifice. Houses could not have been guilty&nbsp;by committing an act that displeases the Lord, as they are&nbsp;inert by definition. Besides, these houses had already&nbsp;required scraping, removing stones, and plastering, none of&nbsp;which are procedures that were required from afflicted&nbsp;clothing or afflicted skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,54. זאת התורה לכל נגע הצרעת</span><span class="font5">, “this is the law for all</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">manner of the plague known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat;”</span><span class="font5"> this verse once more summing up the subject as a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torah,</span><span class="font5"> is a reminder to&nbsp;the priest not to undertake pronouncing decisions about&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> until he has thoroughly familiarised himself with the&nbsp;subject as well as with the terminology used by the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “to the Children of Israel;” the addition&nbsp;of these words is a reminder that the conditions described&nbsp;forthwith apply only to Israelites. Gentiles, even if they&nbsp;display these symptoms cannot confer ritual impurity on&nbsp;Israelites by means of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איש, </span><span class="font5">an adult male, not a minor; [if that word had not been repeated. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איש</span><span class="font5">, the repetition of the word converts this line into something more inclusive, hence the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachah</span><span class="font5"> rules that&nbsp;minors are also included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מבשרו </span><span class="font5">“from his flesh;” this restrictive clause teaches that as long as this issue is still in contact with its origin, i.e.&nbsp;connected to the person from which it came forth, it does not&nbsp;confer ritual impurity on those who come into contact with it.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span><span class="font5"> The word בשרו is a simile for the private parts of the&nbsp;person from which the issue emanates. We find this word&nbsp;used in the same sense also in Leviticus 16,4: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומכנסי בד יהיו&nbsp;על בשרו, </span><span class="font5">he shall wear linen trousers on his flesh (to cover his&nbsp;private parts). Another example of the word בשר referring to&nbsp;private parts is found in verse 19 of our chapter: זובה בבשרה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">“an emission from her flesh,” i.e. vagina</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;רר בשרו את זובו</span><span class="font5">, “his flesh ran with his issue;” the&nbsp;word את here is to be understood as מן, i.e. “from;” we have&nbsp;an example of this use of the word את when Moses tells&nbsp;Pharaoh he is going too pray for the plague to stop when he&nbsp;leaves the boundaries of the city, i.e. כצאתי את העיר (Exodus&nbsp;9,29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,4. ואיש אשר יגע</span><span class="font5">, “and a man who touches;” he contaminates his clothing at the time he touches his bed, his&nbsp;clothing will become contaminated. When he separates from&nbsp;the bed, seeing that his status of ritual contamination is&nbsp;relatively mild, i.e. ראשון לטומאה, one step removed from the&nbsp;impurity’s origin, his clothing had not become contaminated&nbsp;also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במשכבו</span><span class="font5">, “his bed;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> we learn from this that the ritual impurity of his bed is more severe than if he&nbsp;had touched the source of the impurity, the emission itself. If&nbsp;someone had touched him, he would become impure only in&nbsp;the second degree, requiring only to wait for sunset in order&nbsp;to regain his purity. Sitting on the bed of the person who had&nbsp;had this involuntary emission of semen is worse than his&nbsp;body touching the source of the emission. A person who&nbsp;touched only the body of the person having suffered this&nbsp;emission, only needs to immerse his clothing in a ritual bath,&nbsp;in order to regain his ritual purity. (Compare verse 8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,11. 'כל אשר יגע בו הזב וגו, </span><span class="font5">“anything that the person who had the emission touches, etc.” this is not really the&nbsp;place where this verse should have been written. It should&nbsp;have been written after verse 13: וכי יטהר הזב מזובו, “when the&nbsp;person concerned has become purified again from this&nbsp;contamination;” i.e. before the seven days he has to count&nbsp;have expired. The reason why it was written here and not&nbsp;there, is since the Torah had already been in the middle of&nbsp;dealing with this status of a person who touches ritually pure&nbsp;things while himself being ritually contaminated, the Torah&nbsp;saw fit to stick to that subject matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וידיו לא שטף במים</span><span class="font5">, “without first having rinsed his hands with water;” on this line Rabbi Elazar ben Aroch commented&nbsp;that the act of purifying one’s hands by washing them with&nbsp;water is a biblical commandment. [It is not just a Rabbinical&nbsp;decree. Ed.] Actually, the line “rinsed with water,” is an&nbsp;elegant way of saying that immersion in a ritual bath is&nbsp;necessary. We find this confirmed in Psalms 26,6 where&nbsp;David says: ארחץ בנקיון כפי, ”I wash my hands in innocence;”&nbsp;[he does not refer to tap water, but to a ritual bath. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכלי חרש אשר יגע בו</span><span class="font5">, “and any earthen vessel&nbsp;which the person afflicted with involuntary issue touches will&nbsp;have to be broken;” in this verse the Torah uses the pronoun&nbsp;בו, implying touch from the outside, whereas in Leviticus 6,21&nbsp;where the Torah wrote about holy things </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">within </span><span class="font5">an earthen&nbsp;vessel it stated that that vessel must be broken, as it cannot&nbsp;be used for a profane purpose anymore, some of the holy&nbsp;stuff having been absorbed by it, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font5">pronoun is used,&nbsp;instead of בתוכו, “</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">inside </span><span class="font5">it.” From this we derive, seeing that&nbsp;we have stated that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">zav</span><span class="font5"> contaminates only an airspace,&nbsp;that if here the Torah used the word בו, it must mean that&nbsp;even indirect touching confers ritual impurity here. This&nbsp;impurity is called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tumat hesset,</span><span class="font5"> and in practice it means even&nbsp;indirect contact such as sitting on top of several blankets&nbsp;confers this impurity even to the lowest blanket in that stack,&nbsp;or even shaking something so that it will come into contact&nbsp;with the source of the impurity. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לטהרתו</span><span class="font5">, “after his process of purification has&nbsp;begun when the emission has stopped and seven days had&nbsp;elapsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורחץ בשרו במים חיים</span><span class="font5">, “and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, [emanating from the earth, i.e. a spring; Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The person suffering from such involuntary seminal emissions cannot merely immerse himself in a ritual bath, but&nbsp;requires “living water,” as opposed to stagnant water, such&nbsp;as a collection of rain water. On the other hand, his vessels,&nbsp;as well as a person suffering from the skin disease </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">do not require spring water for their purification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יקח לו</span><span class="font5">, “he (the priest) will take on his behalf;” the&nbsp;word לו here means that these birds must be owned, i.e. paid&nbsp;for, by the person on whose behalf the birds will be offered&nbsp;as a sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,16. ואיש כי תצא ממנו שכבת זרע</span><span class="font5">, “and if a flow of seminal emission originated from a man;” the word איש in this verse&nbsp;exempts a minor from this legislation, as long as that minor is&nbsp;not yet nine years of age and one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי תצא ממנו</span><span class="font5">, as long as this semen has not left his body it does not confer ritual impurity. Seeing that this sounds&nbsp;somewhat superfluous, the Rabbis interpreted this to mean&nbsp;that both a priest and an ordinary person who experience an&nbsp;erection can or should (as the case may be) take hold of their&nbsp;member to prevent the emission until it is not likely to come&nbsp;into contact with something subject to contamination. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורחץ במים</span><span class="font5">, “he may even immerse himself in a ritual bath;” [does not require spring water. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את כל בשרו</span><span class="font5">, the bath must contain enough water to cover his entire body at one time when he immerses himself in it.&nbsp;According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachah</span><span class="font5"> this is 3 cubits high, 1 cubit wide and&nbsp;1 cubit deep, or approx .530000 cubic centimeters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר יהיה עליו שכבת זרע</span><span class="font5">, “(garments or skin) which&nbsp;have been splattered with semen of a human being;” even&nbsp;only partially; (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">) just as when this subject was discussed&nbsp;previously it referred to fresh, moist semen, so here too the&nbsp;Torah speaks of freshly emitted semen, not dried out semen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר ישכב איש אותה שכבת זרע</span><span class="font5">, “also the woman with&nbsp;whom a man had had carnal intercourse involving the&nbsp;ejaculation of semen;” the wording of this line teaches that&nbsp;any ejaculation into thin air is not considered as carnal&nbsp;intercourse for this law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורחצו במים</span><span class="font5">, they have both to immerse themselves in a ritual bath; just as when this subject of “washing” i.e.&nbsp;immersing oneself in a ritual bath did not include washing out&nbsp;one’s private parts, the woman’s vagina, so here too, only&nbsp;the surfaces of the skin have to be in contact with the water&nbsp;of the ritual bath, but aj] the skin has to be made accessible&nbsp;to that water, [cleaning fingernails and toenails, for instance.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,19. שבעת ימים תהיה בנדתה</span><span class="font5">, “she will remain in her state of ritual impurity for a full seven days;” if she immerses&nbsp;herself before evening the immersion is not valid. (Talmud&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim,</span><span class="font5"> folio 90)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,21. ורחץ במים</span><span class="font5">, “he will have to immerse himself in a&nbsp;ritual bath and he remains ritually impure until nightfall.” It&nbsp;goes without saying that his partner in intercourse in a state&nbsp;of menstruation will have to do no </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">less</span><span class="font5"> than the male. [The&nbsp;Torah here does not speak of the parties involved having&nbsp;deliberately ignored her state of menstruation, an act which&nbsp;is punished by death through heavenly intervention (Leviticus&nbsp;20,18 for both.) Here the scenario is that during intercourse&nbsp;the woman suddenly sees some blood not having expected&nbsp;to do so. [No violation of the Torah’s law had been intended&nbsp;by either party. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,23. ואם על המשכב הוא</span><span class="font5">, “if he is on the bed (of his partner) with most of his body.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand the word הוא in this verse as referring to the person who has contracted the&nbsp;disease of involuntary seminal emission. According to them,&nbsp;we must understand the verse as follows: “if that blood which&nbsp;was on the couch or on any chair on which the woman in&nbsp;question has sat after having experienced the symptoms has&nbsp;now been touched or even if he touched the vessel or chair&nbsp;on which she had sat, he will remain ritually impure until&nbsp;nightfall after he has immersed himself in a ritual bath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us quote a practical example, using verse 17. We read there: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל בגד אשר יהיה עליו שכבת זרע</span><span class="font5">, “and every garment&nbsp;on which has come moist human semen, (Jewish) etc.,” you&nbsp;might well ask why this verse has been written at all. If&nbsp;someone who has only come into contact with the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">garment&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">that had been stained with semen by its wearer has thereby&nbsp;become ritually impure, how much more so will someone&nbsp;who has been lying with the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">body</span><span class="font5"> from which this blood was&nbsp;emitted does not have to undergo purification rites? Answer:&nbsp;Jewish law does not permit a judge to impose a penalty&nbsp;based </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> on logic; unless the penalty has been spelled out&nbsp;in the Torah it cannot be imposed (as the guilty party will&nbsp;plead ignorance of the law.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find the same thing Numbers 19,14: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל הבא אל האהל </span><span class="font5">וכל אשר באהל יטמא, “anyone entering such tent (containing a&nbsp;corpse) will become ritually defiled.” The beginning of the&nbsp;verse refers to someone whose body has partially entered&nbsp;the covered airspace within which the corpse lies. The&nbsp;second part speaks of someone whose entire body is within&nbsp;that airspace. It is no more than logical that the second party&nbsp;will not have to do </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">less</span><span class="font5"> than the first party in order to purify&nbsp;himself. Nonetheless, because of the rule we just mentioned,&nbsp;the Torah had to spell this out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ישכב איש אותה</span><span class="font5">, “a man will lie with her;” this&nbsp;excludes a woman suffering from the skin disease </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">she does not confer her specific impurity to her partner, as&nbsp;the word אותה, implies a limitation, i.e. “only her, someone in&nbsp;her state.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Chafetz Chayim)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על נדתה, </span><span class="font5">as if the Torah had written: עם נדתה, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> her state of menstrual impurity.” Another example of the use of&nbsp;the word על in the sense of עם, is found in Leviticus 25, 31: על&nbsp;שדה הארץ יחשב, “it is considered as belonging </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the field of&nbsp;the land.”</span></p>

The clue are the words: ”to the entrance of&nbsp;the Tent of Meeting;” how could she have done this on this&nbsp;day if she had not first immersed herself in a ritual bath? She&nbsp;would still have been ritually impure? Having immersed&nbsp;herself in a ritual bath before sunset enabled her to bring the&nbsp;birds to the priest still on the same day. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,1. אחרי מות</span><span class="font5">, “after the death;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> queries why this verse was written, as we do not hear what G’d said to Moses, and&nbsp;verse 2 immediately begins with G’d speaking to Moses&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">again</span><span class="font5"> and telling him to tell Aaron that entrance to the Holy of&nbsp;Holies in the Tabernacle is not permitted at any time he so&nbsp;chooses. What was missing in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary is the&nbsp;parable by Rabbi Elazar ben Aroch, who said that when a&nbsp;physician visits a sick person he tells him not to eat certain&nbsp;foods, not to lie down in wet areas, etc; subsequently&nbsp;someone else comes into the room of the patient and tells&nbsp;him the same thing, but he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">adds </span><span class="font5">that if the patient does not&nbsp;heed this warning he is liable to die. The effect of the second&nbsp;person’s warning is far greater than the effect of the&nbsp;physician’s instructions. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> saw in the second verse in our&nbsp;portion a comparison to the second person in Rabbi Elazar&nbsp;ben Aroch’s parable. The Torah realised that in order to&nbsp;impress Aaron sufficiently with the prohibition to enter the&nbsp;Holy of Holies at will, he had to be warned of the&nbsp;consequences if he disregarded the warning. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Torat&nbsp;kohanim)</span><span class="font5"> The version there is as follows: in the second verse&nbsp;Moses is asked to remind Aaron that his two sons had died,&nbsp;because they had ignored the warning not to enter the Holy&nbsp;of Holies unless invited to do so.</span></p><h1 dir="rtl"><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמר ה' אל משה דבר אל אהרן אחיך ואל יבא בכל עת אל </span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,2</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">the Lord said to Moses: “tell your brother Aaron not to enter the Holy of Holies at any time of your choosing, etc;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This paragraph, even though it deals with the laws of the Day of Atonement, was told to Moses on the day the&nbsp;Tabernacle had been erected , because on that very day the&nbsp;two sons of Aaron had died already because they had&nbsp;entered the Holy of Holies unnecessarily, and unbidden. As a&nbsp;result, the Torah warned Aaron, and of course -everyone&nbsp;else.- You might well ask why this paragraph had not been&nbsp;appended to the paragraph in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Sh’mini,</span><span class="font5"> where we&nbsp;have been told what happened to these two sons of Aaron&nbsp;and what they had done? (Leviticus 10,1-11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason may be that even after learning about all the laws of impurity that disqualify a person in many&nbsp;instances from remaining within the camp of the Israelites,&nbsp;much less that of the priests and the Temple, we had not yet&nbsp;heard if these sons of Aaron had sinned deliberately or had&nbsp;committed merely an error, albeit with the best of intentions.&nbsp;Nor had we been told what manner of atonement would be&nbsp;appropriate for people who commit such a sin inadvertently.&nbsp;This is why the Torah continues here in verse 16: וכפר על&nbsp;הקודש, “he shall make atonement (the High Priest) for the&nbsp;holy place.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'בקרבתם לפני ה, “when they had approached the face of the Lord and died as a result.” (verse 1) They had deposited&nbsp;their incense on the golden altar inside the Sanctuary,&nbsp;illegally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל פני הכפורת אשר על הארון</span><span class="font5">, “before the cover of the Holy Ark;” why did the Torah have to write that the lid was on the&nbsp;Holy Ark, when we have all been familiar with this? The&nbsp;reason is that we read in connection with the curtain dividing&nbsp;the Sanctuary from the Holy of holies [in which the Holy Ark&nbsp;and this cover stood, Ed.] </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וסכות על הארון</span><span class="font5">, “you shall screen the&nbsp;Ark with the veil.” (Exodus 40,3) This could have confused us&nbsp;into thinking that the dividing curtain was considered as a&nbsp;cover for the Holy Ark [seeing it screened it from all human&nbsp;eyes except once a year on the Day of Atonement. Ed.] We&nbsp;have therefore been taught that it was not the function of the&nbsp;dividing curtain to serve as a cover for the Holy Ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא ימות, </span><span class="font5">“so that he will not die as a result.” Now that we have heard the penalty for this sin, where do we find the&nbsp;warning not to commit this sin? It is part of the words: כי בענן&nbsp;אראה על הכפורת</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“for I am capable of being seen above the&nbsp;lid.” [And we know that G’d had told Moses that no human&nbsp;being while connected to its body is granted the privilege to&nbsp;have a visual image of G’d’s essence. (Exodus 33,20) Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי בענן אראה על הכפורת</span><span class="font5">, “for I will only appear screened by a cloud above the lid.” We have another verse explaining the&nbsp;same in Kings I 8,12: ה' אמר לשכון בערפל</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“the Lord has said (of&nbsp;Himself) that He resides within a thick cloud.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,3. בפר בן בקר, </span><span class="font5">“by means of a bull, one year old;” the Torah does not mean that the bull itself is to enter the&nbsp;sanctuary, only its blood [i.e. its essence, Ed.] will be&nbsp;sprinkled within the Sanctuary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,4. 'כתנת בד קדש וגו </span><span class="font5">“a holy linen tunic, etc.” why did the Torah have to repeat the word “בד” four times in this&nbsp;verse? It was to exclude the breastplate, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod,</span><span class="font5"> the robe,&nbsp;and the headband, which did not contain any linen. The&nbsp;reason is that the priest is not to appear in the Sanctuary&nbsp;wearing those garments, although in connection with them&nbsp;the Torah had also used the expression: 'לפני ה, in the&nbsp;presence of the Lord. (Compare Exodus 28,29,- 28,35,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">28,37.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על בשרו, </span><span class="font5">“on his flesh,” covering his private parts, as in זב מבשרו in Leviticus 15,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is the meaning of the words: ילבש, יחגור, יצנוף? [if these garments could not be worn inside the Sanctuary? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that before nightfall the priest would still don those garments, it had to be mentioned that he would wear&nbsp;them, even if not during the morning and afternoon while&nbsp;Temple service was carried out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובמצנפת בד יצנוף</span><span class="font5">, “and he shall be attired with a linen mitre.” From the fact that the breastplate and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ephod</span><span class="font5"> are&nbsp;not mentioned here we learn that during the entire 400 plus&nbsp;years that the second Temple stood these latter garments&nbsp;were not available. There was no point in wearing them if the&nbsp;means of communication with G’d through the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">urim vetumim&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">did not exist during that period. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בגדי קדש הם</span><span class="font5">, “they are holy garments;” this expression here teaches that that term applies to all the priestly&nbsp;garments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורחץ במים את בשרו</span><span class="font5">, “and he is to wash his flesh with water;“ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this line that on that day the High&nbsp;Priest is to immerse himself each time he changed his&nbsp;garments. It is no more than basic courtesy that someone&nbsp;who is a personal attendant of a king purifies himself before&nbsp;he commences a new task each time; this is in addition to&nbsp;the fact that his hands had become sullied each time he&nbsp;handled certain objects or materials. This is why the Torah&nbsp;requires the High Priest in addition to wash his hands and&nbsp;feet each time also. All this has been spelled out in the&nbsp;Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma,</span><span class="font5"> folio </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that our verse inserted the words: ורחץ את בשרו במים, between the words: ופשט, “he is to disrobe,” and the&nbsp;words: ולבש, “and he is to get dressed,” it is clear that what is&nbsp;required is that prior to each changing of the garments he&nbsp;must immerse himself in a ritual bath. Seeing that those&nbsp;words were not necessary in order to teach us that he must&nbsp;immerse himself, they had to be applied to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">separate</span><span class="font5"> washing&nbsp;of hands and feet. As far as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> writing that he must&nbsp;sanctify hands and feet from the כיור, the special basin for&nbsp;this positioned near the entrance to the Tabernacle, it is clear&nbsp;that the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">water</span><span class="font5"> in that basin must be used for this purpose, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 43, concludes that there was a special&nbsp;golden ladle available on that day, not just the copper faucets&nbsp;used normally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,6. וכפר בעדו</span><span class="font5">, “he will perform atonement for his personal sins;” he will recite a confession by mouth. If you&nbsp;were to assume that the Torah here refers to an atonement&nbsp;by means of the blood of a sacrifice, our sages understood,&nbsp;after looking at verse 10 where we read the words: לכפר עליו&nbsp;in connection with the scapegoat, where it is clear that a&nbsp;confession by mouth is described, that the same expression&nbsp;being used here is meant to draw a parallel, i.e. that he is to&nbsp;recite a verbal confession. In verse 21 the words: והתודה עליו&nbsp;“he will make a verbal confession,” are spelled out clearly.&nbsp;This confession was in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">addition</span><span class="font5"> to the blood of the animal&nbsp;being sacrificed. If you were to ask why the High Priest did&nbsp;not also recite a confession over the male goat whose blood&nbsp;was sprinkled inside the Sanctuary, the reason was that it&nbsp;was destined for G’d, and it would be unseemly to make use&nbsp;of it for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">needs </span><span class="font5">of creatures here on earth. The Torah had&nbsp;especially written that this animal had been chosen by lot to&nbsp;be G’d’s. (verse 9) (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">). According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Malbim,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;unnecessary word עלה in this verse may be the reason for the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra’s</span><span class="font5"> comment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,8. וגורל אחד לעזאזל</span><span class="font5">, “and one lot for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Azazel.”</span><span class="font5"> This word is an alternate word for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Samael,</span><span class="font5"> which means “Satan.”&nbsp;According to Rabbi Eliezer in Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer chapter&nbsp;46, we are commanded to assuage the feelings of Satan on&nbsp;that day so that he will not attempt to interfere with the&nbsp;effectiveness of our repentance. When the Jewish people&nbsp;can enlist even Satan’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">silence</span><span class="font5"> at the throne of G’d, there is&nbsp;no greater bribery than this. We are bidden to enlist this so&nbsp;that our sacrifices are not going to be in vain due to his citing&nbsp;our shortcomings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשהו חטאת</span><span class="font5">, “and it will be made into a sin&nbsp;offering.” This was determined by lot. The High Priest had no&nbsp;hand in which of the two animals wound up as the sin&nbsp;offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'יעמד חי לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “shall be standing alive before the&nbsp;Lord;” initially it will remain standing alive before the Lord,&nbsp;whereas its death will be caused by the rock from which it will&nbsp;be thrown. How long will it have to remain standing alive?&nbsp;According to Rabbi Yehudah, until the High Priest has&nbsp;completed all the procedures resulting in the atonement for&nbsp;the Jewish people, something hinted at in verse 20. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושחט את פר החטאת, </span><span class="font5">“he will slaughter the bull as a&nbsp;sin offering;” whereupon he will take the censer (12) filled&nbsp;with glowing coal, and take some of the blood from that bull&nbsp;(14) so that it will not have time to congeal before he has to&nbsp;sprinkle it. Actually, he has to hand over the blood from that&nbsp;bull to another priest (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> 43) so as to keep it&nbsp;being stirred, while the High Priest is busy with presenting&nbsp;the incense in the Holy of Holies, before commencing with&nbsp;the sprinkling on to the dividing curtain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'מעל המזבח מלפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “off the altar before the Lord;”&nbsp;which is the altar that is described here as being “before the&nbsp;Lord?” According to the prefix letter מ in front of the word מעל,&nbsp;this is the copper altar in front of the Temple, only part of&nbsp;which is directly in front of the entrance of the&nbsp;Temple/Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתן את הקטורת</span><span class="font5">, “he will place the incense, etc.”&nbsp;this incense has been mentioned in verse 2 where G’d&nbsp;explained that he will be making an appearance above the lid&nbsp;of the Holy Ark, beyond the dividing curtain. At that point,&nbsp;Aaron, and of course, anyone of lower rank, is not to go there&nbsp;on pain of death unless commanded to do so by G’d. G’d&nbsp;had made clear that no human being while inside a body can&nbsp;ever have a visual image of His essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to make this point quite clear the Torah writes that the cloud of the smoke from the incense will fill that area&nbsp;so that nothing can be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולקח מדם הפר</span><span class="font5">, “he will take some of the blood&nbsp;from the bull;” he takes it from the priest who had kept stirring&nbsp;it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על פני הכפורת קדמה, </span><span class="font5">“onto the top of the lid, eastward;” on the side of the ark facing east.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על, </span><span class="font5">according to our sages the word על means “upwards.” as in the reciting of the counting by the High&nbsp;Priest, recited in our liturgy on the Day of Atonement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבע פעמים</span><span class="font5">, “seven times.” This number is reminiscent of the Torah in Leviticus 26,24 speaking of G’d punishing us&nbsp;sevenfold for our sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר לעם</span><span class="font5">, “intended for atonement of the people,”&nbsp;and not for other ordinary priests, not of the High Priest’s&nbsp;family. The question then arises by what means did those&nbsp;priests receive their atonement? Answer: by the bull that&nbsp;brought atonement of Aaron’s sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,17.וכל אדם</span><span class="font5">, “not any human being, as they were not allowed into those precincts, but this is a warning to other&nbsp;priests not to be in these holy precincts during the period that&nbsp;the High Priest performs these functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא יהיה באהל מועד, </span><span class="font5">“he must not be within the precincts of the Tent of meeting;” the reason why they were forbidden to&nbsp;be there was so that they would not become suddenly ritually&nbsp;impure, as the priest officiating would not be able to atone on&nbsp;their behalf on the same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והקריב את השעיר החי</span><span class="font5">, “then he will present the live&nbsp;goat;” that goat had required to remain alive until this point.&nbsp;The first time (in our verse) the Torah had written about this&nbsp;goat, the vowel under the letter ה had been a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol,</span><span class="font5"> whereas&nbsp;subsequently (verse 21) it is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את שתי ידיו</span><span class="font5">, “both of his hands;” once the word&nbsp;שתי has been used here with the word for hands being in the&nbsp;plural, this is to teach us that whenever the word appears in&nbsp;the plural mode both hands are meant, without the word שתי&nbsp;needing to be written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והתודה עליו</span><span class="font5">, “and he will confess over him;” how precisely does he word his confession? He recites the&nbsp;following words: אנא השם חטאו ועוו ופשעו בני ישראל, “the&nbsp;Children of Israel committed inadvertent sins, deliberate sins&nbsp;as well as sins reflecting their obstinacy against the Lord;”&nbsp;the people in turn will respond by saying that this was all&nbsp;true, and that they now blessed the glory of the Lord G’d.&nbsp;Thus far they had only confessed sins that they </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">knew</span><span class="font5"> they&nbsp;had been guilty of. How do we know that their confession&nbsp;included sinful acts committed against their will through&nbsp;circumstances beyond their control, as well as possible sins&nbsp;that they had not even been aware of? This is covered by the&nbsp;word: כל עונות, “ail manner of sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The scapegoat that is thrown off the rock on the Day of Atonement results in atonement for sins committed by&nbsp;trespassing on holy grounds and abusing for personal use&nbsp;holy objects or foods reserved for consumption by the&nbsp;priests, etc.. It covers all manner of sins committed&nbsp;regardless of how severe the penalty for these sins if not&nbsp;repented. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביד איש עתי</span><span class="font5">, “by the hand of a man especially (temporarily) appointed for this task.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> (not found) the word: עתי, “which could be translated as: “whose time had come,” this is&nbsp;someone who was destined to die before this year is out.&nbsp;This would account for the fact that it was noticed that the&nbsp;man who had been entrusted with this task never lived out&nbsp;that year. [A well known commentator, author </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of k’lee yakar,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">written several hundred years after that of our author, by the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shlomoh Efrayin ben Aharon,</span><span class="font5"> quotes this&nbsp;commentary, but attributes it to our author. Ed.] We must&nbsp;assume that in those days people used astrology to&nbsp;determine who was not destined to live out the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל ארץ גזרה</span><span class="font5">, “into the wilderness.” Basically, the meaning of the word גזרה, is “radically different from other lands.” We&nbsp;encounter it in this sense in Isaiah 53,8: כי נגזר מארץ החיים, “for&nbsp;he was cut off from the land of the living.” The reason for the&nbsp;choice of such earth to throw the scapegoat into was that if it&nbsp;had been thrown into productive soil it would have made that&nbsp;soil unproductive</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושלח את השעיר במדבר</span><span class="font5">, “and he shall dispatch the goat into the desert.” We find a similar construction in Leviticus 14,7&nbsp;where our author commented on the meaning of the word</span></p>
<p dir="rtl"><span class="font5">.ושלח</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,23. ובא אהרן אל אהל מועד</span><span class="font5">, “and Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> in his commentary on the&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 32, comments on these words by asking&nbsp;why, after having completed the service of the day in the&nbsp;Sanctuary the High Priest has to come to the Sanctuary once&nbsp;more, especially when the Torah does not even spell out&nbsp;what he is to do there. He answers that Aaron had to bring&nbsp;out the spoon and the censer that he had used during the&nbsp;performance of his duties there. These had been used for the&nbsp;sprinkling of the blood and the depositing of the incense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask why did he have to make a return trip to the Holy of Holies for no real purpose, seeing he could&nbsp;have left these tools for the Day of the Atonement of the&nbsp;following year when the ashes in the censer would have&nbsp;cooled off in the meantime?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Actually, this was not an unnecessary return, as it would have been discourteous in the extreme to leave&nbsp;behind items that had become useless and probably&nbsp;offensive looking and smelling in G’d’s palace</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds further that this was not the place where we would have expected the Torah to refer to this, seeing that&nbsp;up until now the Torah had described the entire service in the&nbsp;Tabernacle on that day in the order in which it had taken&nbsp;place. [I am summarizing now. Ed.] If we follow what took&nbsp;place in the Tabernacle, there would have been no need for&nbsp;the High Priest to immerse himself five times and wash his&nbsp;hands and feet ten times as the Talmud had explained, i.e.&nbsp;once for the daily morning sacrifice, followed by the special&nbsp;service required on that day, and again before the offering of&nbsp;the daily evening service. The extra trip into the Sanctuary&nbsp;for retrieving the spoon and the censer necessitated the&nbsp;need for additional immersions in the ritual bath. This is the&nbsp;reason why </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> pointed out that here was not really the&nbsp;proper place to mention this, had it not been for the need to&nbsp;explain why five such immersions were indeed necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The removal of these items took place after the offering of Aaron’s burnt offering, a ram, and that of the ram offered on&nbsp;behalf of the people (verse 24). Each service, i.e. the&nbsp;morning service, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mussaph</span><span class="font5"> service, the evening service,&nbsp;and, on that day the sin offering on behalf of Aaron and his&nbsp;family and again on behalf of the people, according to the&nbsp;Talmud there, required an immersion in a ritual bath, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ורחץ את בשרו במים </span><span class="font5">, “he shall wash his flesh with&nbsp;water. Here the Torah does not speak of an immersion in a&nbsp;ritual bath but of washing hands and feet as we have&nbsp;mentioned earlier on verse 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת חלב החטאת</span><span class="font5">, “and the fat of the sin-offering;”&nbsp;Onkelos translates this verse in the plural mode, i.e. וית תרבי&nbsp;דחטווא, seeing that the Torah speaks of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> the fat parts of&nbsp;bull and the male goat offered inside the Sanctuary on the&nbsp;Day of Atonement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ורחץ את בשרו במים</span><span class="font5">, “and he shall wash his flesh in&nbsp;water.” This was sufficient as his state of ritual defilement&nbsp;does not last longer than until the evening. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושרפו באש</span><span class="font5">, “and there they shall burn it with fire;”&nbsp;the priests will burn their hides and their flesh and their&nbsp;excrement. Just as the hide, flesh and excrement mentioned&nbsp;in Leviticus 4,12 had been cut up before being burned, so&nbsp;here too they had to be cut up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תענו את </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">נפשותיכם</span><span class="font5">, “you are to subject your </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">bodies&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">to discomfort;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5"> on this verse he&nbsp;understands the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נפשותיכם </span><span class="font5">as “the house of your soul,”&nbsp;i.e. your body. One subjects one’s body to discomfort by&nbsp;denying it food and drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ביום הזה יכפר עליכם</span><span class="font5">, “for on this day he will atone&nbsp;for you, et.;” a reference to the rituals performed by the High&nbsp;Priest. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah interprets the words: מכל&nbsp;חטאותיכם לפני ה' לפני ה' תטהרו, as meaning that Gd will forgive&nbsp;sins committed directly against Him, but not including sins&nbsp;committed against our fellow human beings unless we had&nbsp;obtained those people’s forgiveness first. (Compare Leviticus&nbsp;23,28).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,31. שבת שבתון היא</span><span class="font5">, “it is a Sabbath of solemn rest;” the word היא, here is spelled with the letter י, not as&nbsp;frequently elsewhere with the letter ו. On the other hand, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> word in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> context in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Emor,</span><span class="font5"> (Leviticus&nbsp;23,32) is spelled with that letter ו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font5">Both words are read in&nbsp;accordance with the way they are spelled. If we want to&nbsp;remember this easily we can try and remember Kings I&nbsp;17,15: ותאכל הוא והיא, “he and she ate;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכם</span><span class="font5">, “for you (pl. masc.)” this is a reference to the day of Atonement, which has been sanctified for your sakes. On the&nbsp;other hand, the Sabbath of creation is known simply as שבת&nbsp;לה', “a Sabbath to be devoted to heavenly concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,2. דבר אל אהרן ובניו</span><span class="font5">, “speak to Aaron and his sons;” they were the slaughterers during all the years that the&nbsp;Israelites were in the desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואל כל בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “and to all the Children of Israel.” The reason why this paragraph is inserted here is that it deals&nbsp;with the procedures for slaughtering animals that are to serve&nbsp;as sacrificial animals. As long as the Israelites were in the&nbsp;desert and they all dwelled around the Tabernacle, it was no&nbsp;hardship for them to eat meat only after the animals had first&nbsp;been sanctified as sacrifices, and as a byproduct of getting&nbsp;used to this they were weaned from the practice of offering&nbsp;animal sacrifices to satyrs, as they had been doing in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,4. ואל פתח אהל מועד לא הביאו</span><span class="font5">, “and he had not first brought it to the entrance of the Tent of meeting;” as long as&nbsp;Moses had not erected the Tabernacle, slaughtering of&nbsp;animals could be done anywhere, (compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma</span><span class="font5"> on&nbsp;this portion, section 10) as we find in fact when the Torah&nbsp;described in Exodus 24,5: וישלח את נערי בני ישאל ויעלו עולות,&nbsp;“and Moses sent the young men of Israel, and they offered&nbsp;burnt offerings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As soon as the Tabernacle had been erected and became functional, the people were warned not to offer any&nbsp;sacrifices of animals that had not first been brought to the&nbsp;entrance of the Tabernacle first and been approved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דם יחשב, </span><span class="font5">“it will be considered as if he had shed innocent blood;” the Torah speaks here of slaughtering&nbsp;animals for profane use, just eating their meat, and it wishes&nbsp;to warn people not to consider the slaughter of animals as an&nbsp;act of worshipping idols, as will be explained forthwith, (verse&nbsp;7) when it continues with: ולא יזבחו עוד את זבחיהם לשעירים, “and&nbsp;they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the satyrs.” The&nbsp;Jewish people had been deeply involved in idolatrous&nbsp;practices. The Torah now commands that when the time&nbsp;comes when they will use animals for profane purposes, this&nbsp;must be just that, without a tinge of idolatry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דם שפך ונכרת, “</span><span class="font5">such a man has shed blood and he will be erased, etc.” The reason why this would be considered at&nbsp;least as serious an offence as murder, is that if that animal&nbsp;were not used for his own food, it should only have been&nbsp;killed as an offering to its Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דם שפך ונכרת</span><span class="font5">, so far we have only heard of the penalty; where did the Torah write the warning not to commit this&nbsp;offence? We find it in Deuteronomy 12,13: השמר לך פן תעלה&nbsp;עולותיך בכל מקום אשר תראה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“take heed not to offer your burnt&nbsp;offering in any place of your choosing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,5. וזבחו זבחי שלמים</span><span class="font5">, “and slaughter them as meat offerings;” this verse has been written in an abbreviated&nbsp;mode as the word 'לה, “in honour of the Lord,” has been left&nbsp;out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,7. חקת עולם</span><span class="font5">, “this shall be a statute for ever.” These&nbsp;words must not be understood as connected to what is&nbsp;written in verse 9 about people who offer sacrifices on altars&nbsp;other than the altar in front of the Tabernacle/Temple who&nbsp;are guilty of the most serious penalty there is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[This editor has failed to understand all his life how the people could have ignored this warning not to offer sacrifices&nbsp;on private altars until about 100 years before the destruction&nbsp;of the first Temple, under the rule of King Yoshiyahu, (Kings&nbsp;II chapter 23) i.e. for close to eight hundred years after they&nbsp;had come to the Holy land. In spite of all the prophets&nbsp;warning and even the Kings loyal to the Torah’s injunctions&nbsp;this law had been consistently ignored. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר יאכל כל דם, </span><span class="font5">“who eat any blood;” the Torah&nbsp;has repeated its warning not to eat blood on many occasions&nbsp;as it is something that will be absorbed by our tissues&nbsp;whereas fat and tendons are not so absorbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.11. כי נפש הבשר בדם היא</span><span class="font5">, “for the life of the flesh is in the blood;” the word היא has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik</span><span class="font5"> under the first&nbsp;letter where it is spelled with the letter ו, and the last time it&nbsp;appears in this paragraph in verse 14, it is also read as if it&nbsp;had been spelled with a ו as if it had been written with the&nbsp;letter י i.e. feminine. The two times in between when the word&nbsp;appears it is read as masculine, and it is spelled both times&nbsp;with the letter ו as appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בנפש יכפר</span><span class="font5">, and it can therefore atone for someone else’s life. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על כן אמרתי</span><span class="font5">, “therefore I have said, etc;” this is a&nbsp;reference to Leviticus 3,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ציד חיה</span><span class="font5">, “this is an all-inclusive term, including all&nbsp;free roaming beasts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או עוף</span><span class="font5">, “or fowl;” regardless if few or many; from this expression our sages derived that if one killed 100 or one&nbsp;beast or bird in one location the covering of their blood can&nbsp;be combined into a single operation. [They do not need to be&nbsp;interred in individual graves. Ed.] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חיה או עוף</span><span class="font5">, “four-legged free roaming beasts or birds;” the two categories of creatures are lumped together to teach&nbsp;that they share a common denominator, i.e. this legislation&nbsp;applies to creatures that are not acceptable as potential&nbsp;sacrifices on the altar. By the same token, in order that we&nbsp;should not think that the blood of domesticated beasts that&nbsp;are permitted as food has not been forbidden, the Torah&nbsp;adds: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכסהו בעפר, </span><span class="font5">“its blood is to be covered,” as it is clear&nbsp;from that that it will not be fit to be eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי נפש כל בשר דמו בנפשו הוא</span><span class="font5">, “for the life of any flesh is all one with its blood;” the verse has been somewhat&nbsp;abbreviated, and should really have read בדמו נפשו, “its life is&nbsp;inextricably bound up with its blood.” Another example of a&nbsp;similarly abbreviated verse would be Psalms 65,5: היכלך,&nbsp;apparently: “Your Sanctuary,” but in reality: “the Sanctuary of&nbsp;Your holiness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואמר לבני ישראל, </span><span class="font5">this line must be understood as: ואמר הבר לבני ישראל, “as I have </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">already</span><span class="font5"> said to the Children of Israel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,15. וכל נפש</span><span class="font5">, “and any person,” i.e. even minors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר תאכל נבלה וטרפה</span><span class="font5">, “that eats either dead animals that have died by natural causes or by having been fatally&nbsp;wounded;” this was repeated as seeing these kinds of&nbsp;animals are not acceptable on the altar I might have thought&nbsp;that they are permitted as an ordinary part of our diet. Seeing&nbsp;that this was the point where the Torah enlarged on a&nbsp;number of forbidden foods it was appropriate not to neglect&nbsp;mention of these last two categories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,3. כמעשה ארץ מצרים וכמעשה ארץ כנען</span><span class="font5">, Rabbi Yossi the&nbsp;Galilean, raised the point that seeing the Torah had&nbsp;compared the cultures of Egypt to that of the Canaanites,&nbsp;and that of the Canaanites to that of the Egyptians, why were&nbsp;we commanded to wipe out the Canaanites and to replace&nbsp;them in their former homeland, while the Torah did not&nbsp;command us to destroy the Egyptians and their culture? The&nbsp;Canaanites were granted to live on their land for 47 years&nbsp;longer than it took for G’d to punish the Egyptians as we&nbsp;know that Chevron was founded seven years earlier than its&nbsp;counterpart </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tzoan</span><span class="font5"> in Egypt? (Compare Numbers 13,22) The&nbsp;answer to his question is that they had the merit of burying&nbsp;Avraham in the cave of Machpelah going for them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our paragraph was written at this juncture because the satyrs to whom the Egyptians sacrificed and whom the&nbsp;Israelites while there copied, have been mentioned&nbsp;immediately before this paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וחי בהם</span><span class="font5">, “and live by them;” the implication is that&nbsp;failing to perform the commandments will bring about those&nbsp;people’s deaths, i.e. their souls will be wiped out, their&nbsp;connection to the Jewish nation will cease. (as spelled out&nbsp;more specifically in verse 29 of this chapter.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.6</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תקרבו</span><span class="font5">, “do not approach;” this expression is a&nbsp;simile for describing carnal relations. An example of the use&nbsp;of this expression elsewhere is in Genesis 20,4: ואבימלך לא&nbsp;קרב אליה, “Avimelech did not approach her,” or Isaiah 8,3:&nbsp;ואקרב אל הנביאה, “I was intimate with the prophetess;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תקרבו</span><span class="font5">, the reason this line is used in the plural mode is to warn </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> parties not to indulge in such carnal relations.&nbsp;The normally more passive partner is considered equally&nbsp;guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ערות אחותך</span><span class="font5">, “the nakedness of your sister;” this&nbsp;part of the verse concerns carnal relations without the benefit&nbsp;of marriage. [she is your sister from a an illicit relationship&nbsp;that your father indulged in. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בת אביך</span><span class="font5">, “the daughter of your father;” the result of your father having raped a woman, or seduced her, as a result of&nbsp;which she bore that daughter. This is why the Torah added&nbsp;the words: מולדת בית “born at home,” to describe this&nbsp;relationship. On the other hand, the expression מולדת חוץ,&nbsp;“born outside,” refers to the result of a stranger having raped&nbsp;or seduced your mother as a result of which she bore an&nbsp;illegitimate daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ערות בת בנך או בת בתך</span><span class="font5">, “the nakedness of your&nbsp;son\s daughter, or your daughter’s daughter, etc.;” how do&nbsp;we know that the “nakedness of your daughter” is also&nbsp;included although the Torah has not spelled this out? We&nbsp;derive this from the expression: הנה, both at the end of this&nbsp;verse as well as in verse 17. The Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;76, elaborates on this. [Actually logic dictates that if it is&nbsp;forbidden to have carnal relations with one’s grandchild, it is&nbsp;certainly forbidden to have such relations with one’s child.&nbsp;However, the sages preferred to find a hint of this in the&nbsp;written text of the Torah, also. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אחותך היא</span><span class="font5">, “she is your sister.” Here the Torah&nbsp;speaks of a “sister” who is the result of an official union,&nbsp;whereas previously, in verse 9 it spoke of the result of a&nbsp;casual relationship. The same is true when the Torah spoke&nbsp;of “the daughter of your mother by marriage, all the more so&nbsp;the daughter, i.e. a sister who is the result of carnal relations&nbsp;between either your father or your mother outside the bonds&nbsp;of marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואשה אל אחותה</span><span class="font5">, “and a woman *(as a wife) in&nbsp;addition to her sister;” this construction is also found in “ אל&nbsp;חלליהם, in Joshua 13,22, where it means: “together with the&nbsp;others who had been slain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תקח לצרור</span><span class="font5">, “you must not marry to become a rival;” the result would be that both these women (the sisters)&nbsp;would be widows in the house of their husbands while the&nbsp;husband is alive, as he is forbidden to have marital relations&nbsp;with either one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לגלות ערותה</span><span class="font5">, “to reveal her nakedness;” to the second one while both are alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עליה</span><span class="font5">, “with her;” we find the expression על used in the sense of “with,” also Leviticus 25,31 על שדה הארץ יחשב, “they&nbsp;will be considered as belonging </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the fields of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תקרב לכלות ערותה</span><span class="font5">, “you must not indulge in&nbsp;marital relations with her at the time when she has her&nbsp;menses.” He must refrain until she has become purified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">■</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא תחלל את שם אלוקין </span><span class="font5">“so that you do not</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">desecrate the name of your G’d.” Who is this G’d of yours? None other than the G’d we revere as the tetragram, the One&nbsp;Who referred to Himself as 'אני ה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תועבה היא</span><span class="font5">, “it is an abomination;” the letter ו in the&nbsp;word הוא is vocalised with a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik״</span><span class="font5"> i.e. it is read as such, it is&nbsp;feminine. [I have not understood the author’s reference to&nbsp;Job here. Ed.] 36,32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לרבעה</span><span class="font5">, “to defile herself;” the letter ה at the end&nbsp;has a dot in it, indicating that it is not the beast that becomes&nbsp;defiled, but the woman who committed this perversion. On&nbsp;the other hand, the same letter in the same word in Leviticus&nbsp;20,16 is “weak,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תבל הוא</span><span class="font5">, “it is a perversion. The letter ו, here has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shuruk,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. the word תבל is a masculine noun. [Our&nbsp;author points this out as in other places the word תבל,&nbsp;meaning “universe,” is feminine, as in Psalms 24,1; 98,7;&nbsp;50,12; etc., etc. [The author may wish to see in this treatment&nbsp;of the word here as masculine, proof that the Torah always&nbsp;considers the male human being as the initiator of these&nbsp;kinds of perversions. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.25. ותקיא הארץ “</span><span class="font5">The land spewed out</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">anything a&nbsp;person vomits becomes repugnant to him, and he does not&nbsp;want to have a second look at it. [In other words, he does not&nbsp;even long to return to his former homeland. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמרתם אותם</span><span class="font5">, “you will observe them (not to&nbsp;violate them).” Seeing that you have already learned to keep&nbsp;G’d’s commandments while in the desert, you will not feel&nbsp;doing so as a hardship when you take possession of your&nbsp;inheritance, your own land. Our author compares this to the&nbsp;poetic manner in which Solomon describes the chastity of&nbsp;Jewish women in Song of songs 4,12, where he likens it to a&nbsp;securely locked garden. Seeing that Jewish girls guarded&nbsp;their virginity before marriage, they will not find it difficult to&nbsp;observe fidelity once they are married.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את חקותי, </span><span class="font5">the laws governing incest and chastity that were the principal subject of this portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת משפטי</span><span class="font5">, “and My social laws; you will be careful not to violate them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,28. ולא תקיא הארץ אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “and the land will not spew you out.” If you do violate My commandments, not only will&nbsp;the land vomit you, but many of the sins you will become&nbsp;guilty of will carry the additional penalty of severing your&nbsp;souls from the Jewish people and their potentially eternal&nbsp;afterlife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר קאה, </span><span class="font5">“as it had already vomited;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">we find here that the same land had already once spewed out its former inhabitants. The word קאה in the&nbsp;masculine mode suddenly, [as compared with תקיא at the&nbsp;beginning of this verse, Ed.] reminds us of a previous time&nbsp;when the Torah used it in the masculine mode in connection&nbsp;with the noun ארץ, which is usually a feminine noun. The&nbsp;other time it was described as performing something in the&nbsp;masculine mode was in Genesis 13,6 when the land of&nbsp;Canaan was described as incapable of supporting both the&nbsp;herds and flocks of Avraham and his nephew Lot, as they&nbsp;had become too numerous. Our author quotes several other&nbsp;examples of this as in: Isaiah 9,18, Zecharyah 14,10, and&nbsp;Genesis 29,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הנפשות</span><span class="font5">, “the souls,” the Torah employs the plural&nbsp;mode to teach us that both parties, i.e. also the woman will&nbsp;be subject to the same penalty from heaven, i.e. G’d will see&nbsp;to it that they will be totally severed from their celestial origin,&nbsp;seeing that our sages basically guarantee that every Jew&nbsp;who did not forfeit it, will have a share in eternal life.&nbsp;[Compare: introduction to first </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> of “Ethics of our&nbsp;Fathers.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לבלתי עשות מחקות התועבות, </span><span class="font5">“not to become guilty&nbsp;of indulging in these abominable acts described previously.”&nbsp;Here the Torah refers to preliminary erotic acts which will&nbsp;eventually lead to violating the basic laws of chastity. They&nbsp;are kissing and hugging the members of the opposite sex,&nbsp;ogling, etc.</span></p>

You must not argue that since it was&nbsp;the accepted norm in this land for many hundreds of years&nbsp;and the people got away with it, we the Jewish people can&nbsp;also adopt their lifestyle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,2. דבר אל כל עדת בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “speak to the entire congregation of the Children of Israel;” This verse teaches&nbsp;that this legislation was revealed to the whole people while&nbsp;they were all assembled. What is the reason for this?&nbsp;Because so many laws are contained in it that address all the&nbsp;people in their daily lives. Our author enumerates a synopsis&nbsp;of all these laws contained in the 37 verses of this chapter&nbsp;showing how even the Ten Commandments were repeated&nbsp;here also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,3. איש אמו ואביו תיראו</span><span class="font5">, “everyone is to revere his mother and father.” Whereas in the parallel commandment in&nbsp;the Ten Commandments, the father is mentioned first, here&nbsp;the mother is mentioned first; the reason is that a baby&nbsp;becomes familiar with his mother before it becomes familiar&nbsp;with his father. When it comes to the observance of the laws&nbsp;governing the Sabbath, and how it is to be observed, the&nbsp;father is addressed first as it is he who has to train his young&nbsp;sons in observing it. The essence of Sabbath observance is&nbsp;to imitate G’d the Creator, Who took time out on that day.&nbsp;The commandment to observe the Sabbath as a holy day of&nbsp;rest appears in the Ten Commandments immediately prior to&nbsp;the commandment to honour one’s parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the reasons that the commandment to observe the Sabbath appears </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> that of obeying one’s parents, is&nbsp;to remind us that when the parents’ orders conflict with G’d’s&nbsp;commandments, the commandment to honour one’s parents&nbsp;by desecrating the Sabbath is automatically overruled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One might at first glance have thought that it was not necessary for the Torah to make this point, as we have a rule&nbsp;that a positive commandment, which generally is considered&nbsp;as overriding a negative commandment, does not do so&nbsp;when the negative commandment had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">also</span><span class="font5"> been expressed&nbsp;as positive commandment, as is the case with the&nbsp;commandment to observe the Sabbath, in the first set of the&nbsp;Ten Commandments. Someone might have interpreted the&nbsp;line of את ה' מהונך כבד, “honour the Lord by using </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">part</span><span class="font5"> of your&nbsp;wealth,” (Proverbs 3,9) as imposing limits on the fulfillment of&nbsp;that commandment when compared to honouring one’s&nbsp;parents where no such limiting factor is built in. These&nbsp;arguments are discussed in the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba&nbsp;Metzia,</span><span class="font5"> folio 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This still leaves the possible argument that the commandment to honour high ranking individuals, i.e.&nbsp;political heads etc., has been provided with an escape clause&nbsp;when the Torah wrote in Exodus 22,27: ונשיא בעמך לא תאור,&nbsp;“and do not curse a high ranking political figure amongst your&nbsp;people,” where the prefix letter ב implies that this&nbsp;commandment only applies to such figures as long as they&nbsp;conduct themselves as upstanding citizens of your people.&nbsp;This could have been applied to a father and mother who do&nbsp;not observe the laws of the Torah as not deserving your&nbsp;respect. Our Rabbis therefore limited the need to disregard&nbsp;parents’ commanding their children to disregarding orders to&nbsp;disregard Biblical prohibitions of the Sabbath, but to carry out&nbsp;orders from father or mother of requests which “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only”</span><span class="font5"> violate&nbsp;Rabbinical restrictions. (This last paragraph does not appear&nbsp;in the handwritten manuscripts of the author.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל תפנו אל האלילים</span><span class="font5">, “do not turn unto idols;” the&nbsp;Torah does not refer to worshipping such idols, but it refers&nbsp;to feasting one’s eyes on the architectural extravagance&nbsp;lavished on their temples, and their esthetic appeal, by&nbsp;admiring them. [This author is reminded of what he has seen,&nbsp;unavoidably, in Thailand, for instance. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואלהי מסכה</span><span class="font5">, “and idols of cast metal (do not construct);” although this commandment has already been written in&nbsp;Exodus 22,27, there it was expressed as addressed to an&nbsp;individual, here it is addressed to the people in the plural&nbsp;mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לרצונכם תזבחוהו</span><span class="font5">, “when you slaughter it&nbsp;demonstrate that you are bent of pleasing the Lord.” How&nbsp;does one do this? You do so by not being stingy when&nbsp;choosing the animal to be slaughtered. [Most of which will&nbsp;serve as meat for the person and family offering it. Ed.]&nbsp;Furthermore, there are people who when offering such&nbsp;sacrifices do not do so from the depth of their heart, but do&nbsp;so as to be seen to have done so by their fellow Jews. This&nbsp;too will not result in G’d welcoming such sacrifices as coming&nbsp;from the heart of the donor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: How must such an offering be presented in order to qualify as man’s generosity </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vis</span><span class="font5"> his&nbsp;Creator?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Answer: “do something that is bound to please G’d.” What, for instance? “Consume the parts of the meat of that&nbsp;animal as soon as possible, i.e. within the first 36 hours.”&nbsp;This demonstrates that you love to eat sacrificial meat while&nbsp;it is still fresh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תזבחוהו</span><span class="font5">, “slaughter it.” You must not slaughter two heads of an animal in a single procedure, [with a long knife.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'כי את קודש ה</span><span class="font5">, “for he defiled something that had&nbsp;been sacred to the Lord.” Once the parts that were destined&nbsp;for the altar have been presented the remainder of the meat&nbsp;is of a holy character. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובקוצרכם</span><span class="font5">, ”and when you reap the harvest;” just as&nbsp;you tender the appropriate parts of the animal peace&nbsp;offerings to the Lord on the altar, so you must set aside the&nbsp;appropriate parts of your agricultural products for the needy&nbsp;of your people as an expression of your honour of the Lord.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובקוצרכם</span><span class="font5">, “this law is applicable only to Israelites, i.e. those who have been Jewish when they reaped the harvest,&nbsp;not if they converted </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> they have harvested the crop.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את קציר ארצכם</span><span class="font5">, “the harvest of the field of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> land.” This teaches that the legislation following also applies to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kitniyot,</span><span class="font5"> to corn, lentils, rice, beans peas, etc.; not only to the&nbsp;crops that could become </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chametz</span><span class="font5"> on Passover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תכלה פאת שדך</span><span class="font5">, “do not completely reap the corner of your field;” Rabbi Shimon holds that as long as the farmer set&nbsp;aside some grain during the various stages of reaping he had&nbsp;fulfilled his obligation, as long as the total is not less than&nbsp;1/60<sup>th</sup> of the field’s total yield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לקצור</span><span class="font5">, “to reap,” this 60<sup>th</sup> is to include all manner of plucking, cutting by hand, or with the tools designated for&nbsp;harvesting. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תגנובו</span><span class="font5">, “do not steal;” here too the Torah&nbsp;repeated by using the plural mode what had already been&nbsp;part of the commandment not to steal in the Ten&nbsp;Commandments, when it was phrased as if only addressed&nbsp;to an individual. The Torah implies that if someone observes&nbsp;theft and is silent, he is no better than the thief himself. (Ibn&nbsp;Ezra) Now that we have read the warning not to steal,&nbsp;whence do we know the penalty for violating this&nbsp;commandment? It says שנים ישלם: “he has to repay twice the&nbsp;value.” (Exodus 22,3.) The commandment not to steal, in the&nbsp;Ten Commandments, dealt with stealing human beings,&nbsp;kidnapping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תכחשו ולא תשקרו</span><span class="font5">, “do not deal falsely nor lie to one another.” The prohibition is spelled out here; where do we&nbsp;have the penalty for violating this commandment? According&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span><span class="font5"> we find it in Leviticus 5,22 in the words: וכחש בה&nbsp;וחמשיתו יוסף עליו, “if he denies it he will have to add a fifth of&nbsp;its value when making good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After G’d had commanded us to give some of what we own to Him, he also warns us not to deprive our fellowman of&nbsp;what is rightfully his. (Ibn Ezra, worded slightly differently)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא תשבעו בשמי לשקר</span><span class="font5">, “and do not abuse My name&nbsp;to swear a false oath;” the reason why this prohibition&nbsp;appears at the end of this string is that when someone is&nbsp;suspected and accused of having lied, stolen, etc., it is likely&nbsp;that in defending himself against the accusation he will add&nbsp;the additional sin of swearing his innocence when knowing&nbsp;that this is not so. All three of these prohibitions, though&nbsp;already written once in singular mode, have been repeated&nbsp;so as not to give a group of people an excuse to commit&nbsp;same by claiming that each one of them had only had a&nbsp;miniscule share in participating in that sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחללת את שם אלוקיך</span><span class="font5">, “and by so doing you have desecrated the name of your G’d.” Swearing a false oath is&nbsp;proof that one does not consider G’d’s name as being&nbsp;sacred, or even worse, that he does not know what is in your&nbsp;heart. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;פעולת שכיר</span><span class="font5">, “the wages of a day labourer;” this&nbsp;expression in the same sense occurs also in Job 34,11, כי&nbsp;פועל אדם ישלם לו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“for He pays a man according to his&nbsp;actions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פעולת שכר</span><span class="font5">, “this includes any type of compensation, for human beings, vessels borrowed, animals borrowed and&nbsp;land borrowed or rented. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,16. לא תלך רכיל</span><span class="font5">, “do not walk around as a talebearer;”&nbsp;do not tell people who have been found guilty at court that if&nbsp;you had been the only judge in that litigation you would have&nbsp;declared the party found guilty as innocent. Seeing that you&nbsp;were in the minority, you regret that your voice was not&nbsp;heard. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: [according to the interpretation that follows the absence of the letter ו before&nbsp;the word לא is of decisive significance. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tale-bearing and standing by idly while your fellow Jew’s blood is being shed are part of the same sin. The&nbsp;Torah warns against tale-bearing as the next step would&nbsp;result in standing by idly while another Jew’s innocent blood&nbsp;is being shed. What started out as being “only” words, is&nbsp;liable to wind up as complicity in murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet Ezekiel 22,9 writing: אנשי רכיל היו בך, “there were talebearers amongst you, continues that verse by&nbsp;writing: “for the sake of bloodshed.” In other words: talebearing is no better that bloodshed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation of our verse: ordinarily the rule of not to go around and bear tales applies. However, if&nbsp;you became privy to a plot being hatched against an&nbsp;innocent person you must not plead this law as an excuse&nbsp;not to have warned the endangered party, or have reported it&nbsp;to the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תלך רכיל</span><span class="font5">, “do not spread evil tales that have come to your attention, but be the one where this practice stops from&nbsp;gaining further ground.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Onkelos renders this commandment as: לא תיכול קורצין, do not make evil gossip public;” the root of the word קורצין, is&nbsp;קרץ, blinking with one’s eyes i.e. instead of mouthing bad&nbsp;comments about people doing the same covertly. The term is&nbsp;found in that sense in the Book of Daniel, (3,8) [which is&nbsp;written in Aramaic, i.e. Targum, Ed.] </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואכלו קרציהם דיהודאי</span><span class="font5">,&nbsp;“they defamed the Jews by blinking with their eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The meaning of the word: הכריזו, is to defame from heaven. In the Targum Yonatan on Samuel II 22,14 אכלי מן&nbsp;שמים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">G’d thundered from Heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.17. לא תשנא את אחיך בלבבך</span><span class="font5">, “do not hate your brother&nbsp;(fellow Jew) in your heart.” If it has come to your attention&nbsp;that that Jew made negative comments about you, accused&nbsp;you falsely behind your back of wrongdoing, do not bottle&nbsp;your resentment up in your heart by hating him.” You should&nbsp;rather</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוכח תוכיח את עמיתך</span><span class="font5">, “remonstrate with your colleague about having wrongly accused you,” asking him what&nbsp;prompted him to badmouth you. Perhaps, once matters are&nbsp;in the open you can demonstrate to your colleague that he&nbsp;completely misinterpreted one of your actions. Alternately,&nbsp;you will become aware that what had been reported to you&nbsp;as having said by him about you was misrepresented, and&nbsp;not meant detrimentally at all. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor Shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You are to act in this manner even if you are convinced that your remonstrations will not help at all. In fact, your&nbsp;failure to make an attempt at reconciliation will be held&nbsp;against you by the heavenly tribunal. This is why the verse&nbsp;concludes with the words: ולא תשא עליו חטא, “so that you will&nbsp;not burden </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> with a sin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עליו “</span><span class="font5">on his account;” this would be parallel to Psalms 44,23: כי עליך הורגנו כל היום, “for it is for Your sake that we are&nbsp;being killed every day.” Compare also: Psalms 69,8: כי עליך&nbsp;נשאתי חרפה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">for I have been reviled for Your sake.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תקום</span><span class="font5">, “do not take revenge;” your inability to&nbsp;conquer your anger would reflect poorly on your personality.&nbsp;G’d is able to suppress His desire to take vengeance, as we&nbsp;know from: נוקם ה' ובעל </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">חימה</span><span class="font5">, “The Lord passionate and able&nbsp;to take revenge but He controls His anger.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא תטור</span><span class="font5">, “and do not nurse a grudge.” The Torah speaks of matters involving money. When it comes to&nbsp;physical harm experienced by the victim, he does not need to&nbsp;become conciliatory until the offending party has made the&nbsp;first move in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternate interpretation: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תקום, </span><span class="font5">“do not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">act vengefullv: </span><span class="font5">ולא תטור, and do not hold a grudge: i.e. in your mind</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תקום</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains this by providing us with a parable: if someone had asked a neighbour to lend him his&nbsp;scythe, and had been refused, and on the day after that&nbsp;refusenik asked him to lend him his spade to dig with, the&nbsp;second person not only refusing but adding as a reason that&nbsp;he was refused the loan of the first person’s scythe, this is an&nbsp;example of revenge, i.e. לא תקום. What then is the meaning&nbsp;of לא תטור, “do not bear a grudge?” Answer: if the second&nbsp;person </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">does</span><span class="font5"> lend his spade to the one who had refused him&nbsp;his scythe, but he added when giving him his spade: “I am&nbsp;not like you who refused me his scythe just yesterday.” The&nbsp;second person still feels vengeful even though he did not act&nbsp;vengefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask why it is that the Torah did not specifically forbid the first person to refuse to lend the second&nbsp;person his scythe, but referred with obvious displeasure to&nbsp;the second person who did lend his tool as having committed&nbsp;a violation of a commandment? Surely the Torah should&nbsp;have criticized the first person for being so miserly as not to&nbsp;lend his tool to his neighbour?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must give the first person the benefit of the doubt for refusing to lend his tool because he may have been afraid&nbsp;that his neighbour would treat his scythe, which he treasured&nbsp;greatly, carelessly, and </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font5"> would explain his refusal. The&nbsp;Torah does not command us to lend our tools against our&nbsp;better judgment as to whom we entrust it. On the other hand,&nbsp;the second person made it clear that he bore the first person&nbsp;ill will for his refusal and he wanted to impress him as being a&nbsp;better person than his neighbour. Therefore the Torah&nbsp;commanded us to allow our goodwill towards our neighbor to&nbsp;outweigh our disappointment over his having refused us&nbsp;without giving an adequate explanation which would have&nbsp;been acceptable and which would have avoided any ill&nbsp;feeling between these two people. By practicing this kind of&nbsp;goodwill we would have contributed to making this a more&nbsp;peaceful world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואהבת לרעך כמוך</span><span class="font5">, “if you (and everyone else) will practice this virtue you will contribute to peaceful relations between&nbsp;man and his fellow.” The prefix letter ל before the word רעך,&nbsp;“your fellow-man,” is superfluous. Other examples of the&nbsp;Torah using such a letter ל as an unnecessary prefix can be&nbsp;found in Exodus 14,28: לכל חיל פרעה, “of the whole army of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pharaoh;” compare also Exodus 27,3: לכל כליו תעשה נחושת</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,” </span><span class="font5">“all of its appurtenances you shall construct out of copper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the Torah was careful not to write </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואהבת רעך כמוך </span><span class="font5">“love your fellowman as you love&nbsp;yourself,” as this is something impossible for human beings&nbsp;to do. It is however, possible to love things that belong to&nbsp;your fellow human being as much as you love the things that&nbsp;are your own. You are to put yourself mentally into the&nbsp;position of your fellow human being, and therefore not to do&nbsp;anything to him that you would not have others do to you. By&nbsp;the same token you should love as much to do favours for&nbsp;him as you would have others do favours for you. The same&nbsp;interpretation also applies to verse 34 in our chapter where&nbsp;we are asked to love the convert to Judaism כמוך, “just like&nbsp;yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,19. את חקותי תשמורו, </span><span class="font5">“you are to observe My statutes;” previously when the Torah commenced a&nbsp;paragraph with this introduction, what followed were the laws&nbsp;about family purity, chastity, incest etc. (18,5) Now it&nbsp;introduces laws of a similar nature applying to different&nbsp;categories of vegetation, and their derivatives, i.e. mixing&nbsp;wool and linen. Fruit-bearing trees must not have branches&nbsp;of other types of fruit grafted on to their trunks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בהמתך לא תרביע כלאים</span><span class="font5">, “you must not try to crossbreed different categories of mammals.” After the Torah had&nbsp;warned us to be holy, i.e. not to forcibly violate natural&nbsp;norms, as well as not to violate personal freedom of your&nbsp;fellowman by violence, now the Torah expands the subject&nbsp;matter to include the animal kingdom. In other words, we are&nbsp;not to tamper with what the Creator had seen fit to create as&nbsp;a separate species, i.e. למינו, למינה, למיניהם, “according to their&nbsp;respective species.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובגד כלאים, </span><span class="font5">“and a garment made of two kinds of fabrics mixed together;” according to some commentators </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor&nbsp;Shor)</span><span class="font5"> the reason behind this prohibition is to distinguish the&nbsp;garments worn by the priests from those worn by ordinary&nbsp;Israelites, the priests having been specifically ordered to&nbsp;wear some garments containing a mixture of wool and linen&nbsp;(as mentioned already in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;4. It is stated there that the word שש in the Torah refers to a&nbsp;type of linen, whereas the word תכלת refers to wool dyed&nbsp;blue). We find something similar with regard to the prohibition&nbsp;of certain fat parts offered on the altar, and all kinds of blood,&nbsp;as well as the oil used for anointing the kings of the house of&nbsp;David, or incense in certain proportions; all of the&nbsp;aforementioned are for the exclusive use in the service of the&nbsp;Lord by the priests. Anyone making personal use of them is&nbsp;as guilty of severe trespass as someone making personal&nbsp;use of the King’s scepter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואיש כי ישכב את אשה</span><span class="font5">, “and any man who lies&nbsp;carnally with a woman who is a bondmaid, etc.” Rabbi&nbsp;Elazar, son of Azaryah, says that seeing that all the various&nbsp;forbidden categories of carnal unions have already been&nbsp;recorded, we must conclude that here we deal with a woman&nbsp;whose legal status is subject to doubt, i.e. a woman owned&nbsp;by two masters jointly, only one of them has already released&nbsp;her into freedom. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נחרפת</span><span class="font5">, betrothed, i.e. promised, to a man (as soon as she will have been released by her other owner) This status&nbsp;can be compared to Job, 29,4 בימי חרפי, “when I was in my&nbsp;prime, i.e. in a transitory stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the word נחרפת means something similar to מופקרת, “abandoned;” Compare Judges&nbsp;5,18: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עם חבפ נפשו</span><span class="font5">, “a people left at the threshold of death.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;איל אשם</span><span class="font5">, “a ram for a guilt-offering.” We have had&nbsp;this expression already in Leviticus 5,18. Our sages use this&nbsp;similarity of expression, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">g’zeyra shaveh</span><span class="font5"> to say that the value&nbsp;of that ram in both instances is to be the same, two shekels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(On verse 19 in that chapter our author speaks of a two-year old ram, not of its value in shekels. Rabbi Chavell)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,23. וכי תבואו אל האבץ</span><span class="font5">, “when you will come into the land;” after the Torah had discussed “seed” in connection&nbsp;with both the woman and the earth, it now discusses seed of&nbsp;a tree that has been planted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונטעתם</span><span class="font5">, “when you will plant;” this expression teaches that the laws about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">orlah</span><span class="font5"> do not apply to branches only&nbsp;grafted onto a tree, nor do they apply to trees that grew as a&nbsp;result of someone having discarded a kernel or seed that had&nbsp;been dropped onto the earth unintentionally and had taken&nbsp;root. When this tree had grown in a region that is inhabited&nbsp;by people, it is considered as if it been planed intentionally,&nbsp;and is subject to the rules following. (Jerusalem Talmud,&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Orlah</span><span class="font5"> 1,1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל עץ מאכל</span><span class="font5">, “every fruit-bearing tree.” This excludes trees that bear no fruit, and trees planted as potential&nbsp;firewood or building material. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span><span class="font5"> The various shrubs that&nbsp;grow wild and provide us with their berries are also excluded&nbsp;from this legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שלש שנים יהיו לכם ערלים, </span><span class="font5">“for a period of three years they will be for you as if “uncircumcised;” (forbidden) anything that&nbsp;matured during these years from these trees after they had&nbsp;been planted may not be stored and eaten even after the&nbsp;three years have expired. It would be bad manners if they&nbsp;would be eaten before the firstling fruit had been offered as&nbsp;an offering to G’d in the Temple first. [It would be equally bad&nbsp;manners to bring such an offering only several years after&nbsp;that fruit had ripened, even if it could have been preserved in&nbsp;prime condition. The laws governing such firstling fruit limit&nbsp;their being offered in the Temple later than by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chanukah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">following their being harvested. Ed.] Seeing that the fruit&nbsp;grown during that period is not of prime quality, it would be&nbsp;insulting to offer it to G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכם</span><span class="font5">, “for you (plural mode);” this is to include fruit trees grown for the benefit of the community as opposed to fruit&nbsp;grown for the benefit of the individual owner </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,26. לא תאכלו על הדם</span><span class="font5">, “you must not eat the flesh of an animal until it is absolutely dead, or, according to some&nbsp;opinions, in the case of sacrificial meat, before it had been&nbsp;salted to remove any traces of life sustaining blood. A third&nbsp;opinion claims that this is a general prohibition not to eat&nbsp;meat stemming from an animal that has not been ritually&nbsp;slaughtered. This would be supported by Samuel I 14,32:&nbsp;ויעש העם את שלל ויקחו צאן ובקר וישחטו ארצה יאכל העם על הדם, “the&nbsp;people (who had been described in the previous verse as&nbsp;being famished) pounced on the spoils; they took the sheep&nbsp;and the cows and calves and slaughtered them on the&nbsp;ground and they </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ate with the blood</span><span class="font5">.” [When King Saul&nbsp;heard about this he was terribly upset and chided them for&nbsp;having sinned against G’d. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the words </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תאכלו על הדם </span><span class="font5">are a variation of the commandment not to practice&nbsp;necromancy. Seeing that the survivors of slain people are&nbsp;charged with avenging their dead, they may feel inclined to&nbsp;sit on the graves of the dead to assuage their dead relatives’&nbsp;anger at not having been avenged. The dead are apparently&nbsp;credited with some power in this respect. (According to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam,</span><span class="font5"> the Emorites believed this, especially about&nbsp;witches who had been murdered. Seeing that the&nbsp;uncircumcised gentiles do eat blood, the Torah would have&nbsp;addressed this subject at this point also.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושרט</span><span class="font5">, “and an incision in your skin or flesh as a&nbsp;sign of mourning,” the word שרט is written in the singular&nbsp;mode although these incisions are usually multiple incisions,&nbsp;in order to warn us that we would be guilty for a separate sin&nbsp;for each such incision, even if they had all been made at the&nbsp;same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לנפש</span><span class="font5">, “on account of a dead;” if you were to do this on account of some other misfortune suffered, such as a house&nbsp;collapsing in an earthquake, or the loss of your cargo by the&nbsp;boat carrying it having sunk, this would not be punishable.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.29. אל תחלל את בתך להזנותה</span><span class="font5">, “do not profane your daughter by letting her become a harlot.” This is a warning to&nbsp;a father not to put off marrying off his daughter before she&nbsp;reaches the age of 12 and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Seeing that the Torah does not address itself to fathers who use their daughters’ bodies as a source of income, the&nbsp;sages did not interpret the verse literally. Ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא תזנה את הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “do not let the land become full of harlots!” The warning implied is that the land itself will copy&nbsp;your perversity if the people on this land will tolerate and&nbsp;practice this also. How does this work in practice? You&nbsp;seeded wheat and the earth produces thorns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the word ארץ is not meant literally but refers to the inhabitants of that earth. We have an&nbsp;example of the word ארץ meaning that in Ezekiel 14,12: ארץ כי&nbsp;תחטא לי ,, “when the land sins against Me,” where it is&nbsp;impossible to understand the word ארץ as “a land,” but it must&nbsp;refer to the people on that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זמה</span><span class="font5">, this word may be understood as an acronym, i.e. זו מה היא?, “what is this?” Who is the father of that mother’s&nbsp;child? (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nedarim,</span><span class="font5"> folio 51).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,30. את שבתותי תשמורו</span><span class="font5">, “you are to observe My Sabbaths;” this is to be understood in accordance with&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> interpretation, i.e. even though in Exodus 31,13 we&nbsp;have been warned concerning this in connection with the&nbsp;construction of the Tabernacle, i.e. that that commandment&nbsp;does not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">override </span><span class="font5">the prohibitions in place on the Sabbath, it&nbsp;needs to be repeated as that structure is most holy and&nbsp;permanent, you must not enter its precincts on the Sabbath&nbsp;carrying your canes, etc. This would be a profanation.&nbsp;[Carrying on the Sabbath in such a public domain regardless&nbsp;of its sanctity is still forbidden. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומקדשי תיראו</span><span class="font5">, “and you must revere My Sanctuary;” as a result of this, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל תפנו אל האובות ואל הידעונים, “</span><span class="font5">you must not turn&nbsp;(for help) to ghosts or unfamiliar spirits; seeing that you have&nbsp;access to G’d through the Temple, what possible use could&nbsp;you have to address yourself to such unreliable sources of&nbsp;information?” [Even </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> Moses’ death you have access to&nbsp;G’d through the breastplate on the chest of the High Priest&nbsp;and the jewels on it, to receive answers to your (the High&nbsp;Priest’s) enquiries.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of ומקדשי תיראו; you are to consider My </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">commandments </span><span class="font5">as sacred. All the&nbsp;commandments are associated with the concept of holiness,&nbsp;sanctity. If we needed proof of this, all we have to do is look&nbsp;at the next paragraph 20,3: למען טמא את מקדשי, where G’d’s&nbsp;commandments are referred to as His “Sanctuary,” followed&nbsp;by ולחלל את שם קדשי, “and to desecrate My Holy Name.” If the&nbsp;word מקדשי were to be translated literally as “My Sanctuary,”&nbsp;we would have a duplication in that verse. Hence it is clear&nbsp;that it refers to “My holy people,” for what desecration of the&nbsp;Temple could be performed if someone had worshipped the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">malach</span><span class="font5"> by making his children walk through fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,33. וכי יגור אתך גר</span><span class="font5">, “if someone lives amongst you who claims to be a convert, I might have thought that he must be&nbsp;accepted as such on his own testimony; therefore the Torah&nbsp;adds the word: אתך, “with you,” i.e. you are familiar with him&nbsp;and he has behaved in a manner which lends support to his&nbsp;claim. He needs to support his claim by witnesses. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאזרח מכם</span><span class="font5">, “as if a natural born Jew.” Just like a natural born Jew is expected to observe aj] the laws of the Torah, so&nbsp;is this convert expected to do so. This verse is the reason&nbsp;why the sages ruled that if a convert is prepared to accept all&nbsp;the laws of Judaism with the exception of one, he is not&nbsp;accepted as a convert. Rabbi Joseph son of Rabbi Yehudah&nbsp;said that even it the prospective convert refuses to accept&nbsp;any of the non-biblical protective clauses of the Torah he is&nbsp;not to be accepted. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי גרים הייתם בארץ מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “for you were treated as strangers while in Egypt.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this phrase&nbsp;that we must not be critical of a shortcoming of a stranger&nbsp;and treat him as second class, as we did not like it when we&nbsp;were treated as second class during the hundreds of years&nbsp;we were in Egypt. While there we worshipped the same idols&nbsp;that the Egyptians had worshipped, so that we have nothing&nbsp;to feel superior about. Joshua reminded the people of this&nbsp;shortly before his death in (Joshua 24,14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,35. ובמשורה</span><span class="font5">, “or in measure.” Our sages used this&nbsp;expression when they said that water should be drunk “in&nbsp;measured quantities (sparingly);” (Ethics of our Fathers 6,4)&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,37. ושמרתם את כל חקתי</span><span class="font5">, “you are to meticulously&nbsp;observe all My statutes;” this was repeated here once more&nbsp;as it sums up the chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,1. וידבר ה, </span><span class="font5">“the Lord spoke;” the reason why this&nbsp;chapter begins with G’d speaking in strong language, i.e. דבר,&nbsp;is because what follows are a series of penalties for people&nbsp;who have deliberately ignored the warnings of the laws&nbsp;enumerated in the previous two chapters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;באבן </span><span class="font5">, “using a stone” The use of the singular for&nbsp;the word “stone” means that unless the first stone has failed&nbsp;to kill the convicted sinner no one else is going to throw any&nbsp;further stones. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואני אתן את פני</span><span class="font5">, “and I will turn My face against that&nbsp;man;” G’d will do this if he cannot be brought to court as&nbsp;there were no witnesses, or if he had not received legal&nbsp;warning of the consequences of committing the sin he had&nbsp;been warned not to commit. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמרתם את חקתי</span><span class="font5">, “you are to observe My statutes;”&nbsp;this is a repetition, as previously the subjects covered had&nbsp;only been incest and the mixing of species in order to create&nbsp;new strains, etc. Now the statutes mentioned were types of&nbsp;idolatry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי איש אשר יקלל את אביו</span><span class="font5">, “for the man who curses&nbsp;his father, etc.” this refers to the warning issued previously.&nbsp;The Torah is saying that if I had warned you not to curse&nbsp;father or mother or belittle them, how much more so does&nbsp;this warning apply to Me, Who have been a partner in&nbsp;creating your father and mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אביו</span><span class="font5">, “his father,” but not his grandfather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אמו</span><span class="font5">,, “his mother,” but not his grandmother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אביו ואמו קלל</span><span class="font5">, “he had cursed his father;” the reason this has been repeated (apparently) is because the Torah wants&nbsp;you to know that seeing the son is the product of both father&nbsp;and mother, i.e. of two strains of blood, he is treated even if&nbsp;he only cursed one of them as if he had cursed both of them.&nbsp;This is reflected in the plural mode of the words דמיו בו, “he is&nbsp;guilty of having cursed their blood,” at the end of our verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואיש אשר ינאף</span><span class="font5">, “and a man who becomes guilty of&nbsp;adultery, etc.” the Torah repeats all the prohibitions listed&nbsp;already in the previous portion in chapter 18, and spells out&nbsp;the respective penalties for each type of transgression. Some&nbsp;of them are arrived at by the use of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">g’zeyrah shaveh,</span><span class="font5"> one&nbsp;of the 13 tools used by Rabbi Yishmael in linking the written&nbsp;Torah to the oral Torah. [marrying, or sleeping with two&nbsp;sisters at the time when both are alive. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנואפת</span><span class="font5">, “and the woman who is a partner in the adultery.” If you were to ask where the warning was written&nbsp;concerning the woman adulteress, the answer is “the&nbsp;seventh of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20,12.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,11. אשר ישכב את אשת אביו</span><span class="font5">, “who engages in carnal relations with the wife of his father;” the reason for this choice&nbsp;of words is that it includes both the guilty person’s mother&nbsp;and a woman that at one time was his father’s wife, totally&nbsp;unrelated to him. How do we know that it also relates to his&nbsp;mother who had never been his father’s wife? When&nbsp;discussing the penalty for such a sexual union, the Torah&nbsp;writes here: ערות אביו גלה, “he revealed the nakedness of his&nbsp;father,” and it writes chapter 18,7 that he must not reveal the&nbsp;nakedness of his father;” it is clear therefore that just as&nbsp;there, by repeating that the prohibition is applicable to his&nbsp;mother as well as to his stepmother, so the same is true here&nbsp;by describing her as his mother; here too the same rule&nbsp;applies. According to the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> folio 54&nbsp;what is meant is a woman whom his father had raped, as a&nbsp;result of which she had become his mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אשת אביו</span><span class="font5">, it says here: “he had uncovered his father’s nakedness [by sleeping with that woman, Ed] and it had said&nbsp;in chapter 18,8: “you must not reveal the nakedness of your&nbsp;father’s wife;” just as there “his father’s wife,” included carnal&nbsp;relations with his father’s widow (sleeping with here after she&nbsp;had become widowed) so in our verse it also includes such a&nbsp;scenario, i.e. legal execution of both parties involved,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 54)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,13. משכבי אשה</span><span class="font5">, intercourse in the full sense of the&nbsp;word, not fondling or premature withdrawal of either party’s&nbsp;male organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תועבה מעשה שניהם</span><span class="font5">, both parties are guilty of an abomination (perversion), unless one party had been raped.</span></p><h1 dir="rtl"><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואיש אשר יקח את אשה ואת אמה, זמה היא, באש ישררפו .20,14</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">“if a man takes his mother-in-law as a sexual partner in addition to his wife, this is a perversion; they shall be&nbsp;executed by “burning;” (having molten lead poured into their&nbsp;throats.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How do we know from the wording of this verse that the same penalty applies to someone who engages in sexual&nbsp;relations with both his daughter and his granddaughter (by&nbsp;this daughter)? The sages use the principle known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">g’zeyrah shavah,</span><span class="font5"> one of the 13 principles of valid&nbsp;interpretation expounded by Rabbi Yishmael in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat&nbsp;Kohanim,</span><span class="font5"> [and recited in our daily morning prayers. Ed.] that&nbsp;when (for no otherwise compelling reason) the Torah used&nbsp;the same wording in discussing different subjects, it was in&nbsp;order to teach us that the details of these subjects have&nbsp;something in common halachically. In this case, it is the&nbsp;word: זמה, used for perversion here, and the same word used&nbsp;in chapter 18,17, where the subject was “mother, daughter,&nbsp;and granddaughter,” (including her son’s daughter) becoming&nbsp;the sexual partners of the same male. In other words,&nbsp;violating the laws expounded in either verse are punishable&nbsp;by the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> type of death penalty, burning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How do I know that it does not matter in this respect if the biological relationships discussed here are based on the&nbsp;male or the female respectively? We find the expressions&nbsp;הנה, “they are,” and the expressions זמה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">perversion</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">” </span><span class="font5">both in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18,17, where it describes the biological relationships of the&nbsp;parties involved by the word שאר, which loosely translated&nbsp;means “family relation.” The subject is elaborated on in the&nbsp;Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> folio 76, where different methods&nbsp;of legal executions are discussed, with emphasis on the&nbsp;penalty of “burning.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor,</span><span class="font5"> also).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת הבהמה תהרוגו</span><span class="font5">, “and the beast (involved in this&nbsp;perversion) you have to kill.” The reason is in order to&nbsp;prevent it to be used in the same manner again and thus&nbsp;cause a Jew to commit this sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לרבעה</span><span class="font5">, “and lie down with it (the beast);” the letter&nbsp;ה at the end of this word does not have a dot, [which would&nbsp;have had significance as a pronoun, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מות יומתו, דמיהם בם</span><span class="font5">, “they will both be put to death, their blood shall be upon them.” The animal in question also acted&nbsp;in a perverted manner, as it has been equipped with an&nbsp;instinctive feeling for what is appropriate for it and what not.&nbsp;Man’s perversions during the antediluvian period, eventually&nbsp;resulted in the perversions of the beasts, and this is why they&nbsp;all had to die together with the human beings. After all, the&nbsp;woman surely did not rape the beast!. She could easily have&nbsp;avoided this experience. On the other hand, when discussing&nbsp;a male committing a sexual act with a female beast, the&nbsp;Torah does not describe the beast as bearing blood guilt,&nbsp;since no doubt the beast had been passive and unable to&nbsp;resist. (verse 15) [In that instance the reason why the beast&nbsp;is also killed is that otherwise the disgrace of a human being&nbsp;treated as inferior even to a beast would have reflected&nbsp;negatively on the whole human race. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,17. ואיש אשר יקח את אחותו</span><span class="font5">, “and if a man takes his sister as a wife, etc;” from verse 18,9, the sages derived&nbsp;what kind of sister and from what kind of mother is prohibited&nbsp;on pains of what penalty. The subject is dealt with in detail in&nbsp;the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> folios 22 and 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיא תראה את ערותו</span><span class="font5">, “and she sees his nakedness;” the word והיא is written with the letter י to make certain that there&nbsp;can be no misunderstanding as to who is meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תראה את ערותו</span><span class="font5">, “the relationship is consensual.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חסד הוא</span><span class="font5">, “it is a shameful thing;” The word הוא, is spelled with the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shuruk;</span><span class="font5"> this vowel reveals that it is the male in&nbsp;that relationship who is guilty. The first section of the verse&nbsp;speaks of consensual perverse relationship between brother&nbsp;and sister, a relationship both try to keep concealed; hence&nbsp;the Torah adds that their punishment will be very public, an&nbsp;example of how the punishment fits the crime. The second&nbsp;part of the verse assumes that the brother had raped his&nbsp;sister, hence the punishment is confined to the brother, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עונו&nbsp;ישא</span><span class="font5">, “he will have to carry the burden of his guilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,19. כי את שארו הערה</span><span class="font5">, “for he has made naked his nearest kin,” if he had raped her. If the relationship had been&nbsp;consensual, both will have to carry the burden of their sins,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">עונם ישאו.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,21. נדה היא</span><span class="font5">, “it is equivalent to sleeping with a woman during her period.” The comparison with a woman during her&nbsp;menses is that just as his wife is permissible to her during&nbsp;certain periods and not others, so a brother’s wife if she had&nbsp;become a widow and had never had any children would not&nbsp;only be permissible to him, but he would fulfill a&nbsp;commandment by marrying her in a levirate ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמרתם את כל חקתי</span><span class="font5">, “and you are to observe all&nbsp;My statutes.” You must not violate any of the commandments&nbsp;involving sexual restrictions and incest. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(bn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת כל משפטי, </span><span class="font5">“and all My instructions concerning penalties for transgressing these laws,” by your judges&nbsp;seeing to this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמרתם את כל חקתי</span><span class="font5">, “the reason why the Torah has repeated this phrase once again, is to remind the people that&nbsp;G’d’s statutes apply in the Diaspora as well as in he Holy&nbsp;Land. In this verse only the statutes applicable in the Holy&nbsp;Land are meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא תלכו בחקות הגוי</span><span class="font5">, “you must not adopt the&nbsp;statutes of gentile nations.” The reason why this too has&nbsp;been repeated here is so that you could not claim that these&nbsp;statutes are only the ones that apply to the Israelites as a&nbsp;community, but not to statutes that apply to them as&nbsp;individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.24. אתם תירשו את אדמתם</span><span class="font5">, “you are about to inherit their land.” You are going to be their heirs as you preceded&nbsp;them in observing My commandments even before being&nbsp;ordered to do so, as our author had explained on chapter</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואני אתננה לכם</span><span class="font5">, “and I will give it to you;” seeing that as the children of Shem, son of Noach who was older that&nbsp;Cham, from whom they have descended, your claim is older.&nbsp;All they (the Canaanites) did while occupying that land was&nbsp;to preserve it for the time when it would become yours.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.25. 'והבדלתם בין הבהמה הטהורה לטמאה, וגו</span><span class="font5">, “you must distinguish between the ritually pure beasts, and the impure&nbsp;ones, etc.;” it is well known that the ritually pure beasts are&nbsp;far fewer in number than the ritually impure ones; this is why&nbsp;the Torah had mentioned them first as not so many need to&nbsp;be enumerated. The same applies to the ratio of ritually pure&nbsp;birds and those that are birds of prey. The reason for the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">warning</span><span class="font5"> here is that it is usual for the minority to eventually&nbsp;become assimilated to the majority and to lose their&nbsp;identifying traits. The Israelites therefore had to be warned to&nbsp;insure that this did not happen. Our author adds a warning to&nbsp;the teachers not to be overly long when explaining matters to&nbsp;their pupils so that they remain alert to concentrate on the&nbsp;essence rather than the more trivial parts. (Talmud, tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> folio 3), [but prior to this, Solomon, in Kohelet,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">12,12. Ed.]</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parrshat Emor</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,1. אמור אל הכהנים</span><span class="font5">, “say to the priests;” after the Torah had warned the Israelites to become “holy,” it warns the&nbsp;priests to be especially careful not to incur ritual impurity.&nbsp;Seeing that they have to perform duties in and around the&nbsp;Sanctuary, incurring ritual impurity would prevent them from&nbsp;being able to carry out their duties, considering they are the&nbsp;members of G’d’s “household” on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This paragraph had been addressed to the priests on the day when the Tabernacle had been erected, seeing that&nbsp;on that day they were already required to perform some&nbsp;duties therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why this paragraph follows immediately after the warning not to indulge in divining the future by&nbsp;consulting people practicing any kind of witchcraft, is to&nbsp;inform them that from a legal point of view anyone doing so&nbsp;should be stoned to death, as Israelites have no need for&nbsp;such people; if anyone felt the need, they should turn to the&nbsp;priests who in turn would consult G’d about their problems by&nbsp;means of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">urim vetumim</span><span class="font5"> in the folds of the breastplate of&nbsp;the High Priest. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בני אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “the sons of Aaron,” including minors;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא יטמא בעמיו</span><span class="font5">, “he must not defile himself on account of any Israelite that had died, i.e. although they are all of “his&nbsp;people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,3. הקרובה אליו, </span><span class="font5">“who is related to him;” she is related&nbsp;to him only as long as she has not married. As soon as his&nbsp;sister is betrothed this relationship has ended, halachically.&nbsp;(Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> folio 29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאביו ולאמו</span><span class="font5">, to his father or his mother;” the letter ו before the word לאמו means: “or,” instead of “and.” The same&nbsp;applies in לבנו ולבתו, or in ולאחיו ולאחותו. In each of these&nbsp;words the prefix ו means “or” instead of “and.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the question why the word ולאביו, “or to his father,” was needed to permit the son to defile himself at his father’s&nbsp;funeral, seeing that the relationship is of a lower level as that&nbsp;of the mother, [being only presumptive as we do not know for&nbsp;sure that he is the father, Ed.], we might have thought that on&nbsp;account of this the Torah would not have allowed the son the&nbsp;priest to defile himself at the funeral;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">on the other hand if the Torah had only mentioned that the son could defile himself at his father’s funeral, we would&nbsp;have taken for granted that if even this was allowed,&nbsp;attending his mother’s funeral would certainly be allowed.&nbsp;However, I could have argued the reverse: if I cannot defile&nbsp;myself on account of my father’s funeral when he had&nbsp;disgraced himself and lost his status as a functioning priest, I&nbsp;can certainly not defile myself on account of my mother’s&nbsp;funeral, if my mother had lost her status as legitimately&nbsp;married to a priest. In light of these problems, the Torah&nbsp;decided to mention father and mother separately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאמו ולאביו</span><span class="font5">, “to his mother or father;” when the Torah speaks of an ordinary priest, it mentions the mother before&nbsp;the father, whereas when speaking of the prohibition for the&nbsp;High Priest to defile himself for the death of his parents, it&nbsp;mentions first the father and then the mother. (verse 11) The&nbsp;logic runs as follows: if an ordinary priest </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">may</span><span class="font5"> defile himself&nbsp;at his mother’s funeral, seeing that we are certain that she is&nbsp;his kin, the Torah broadens this to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">also</span><span class="font5"> include the father,&nbsp;though he is by no means definitely a blood relative. When&nbsp;speaking of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">prohibition</span><span class="font5"> for the High Priest to attend even&nbsp;his closest relative’s funeral, it mentions the father first,&nbsp;seeing that he is not definitely a blood relative. It continues&nbsp;by saying that this High Priest may not defile himself even for&nbsp;the sake of his mother’s funeral, although we know definitely&nbsp;that he is her son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ולבנו ולבתו, “and on account of his son or his daughter,” (he may defile himself) if the Torah had only written about&nbsp;either son or daughter, why would this not have been enough&nbsp;to tell us that the priest may defile himself at the funeral of&nbsp;any of his children, G’d forbid? Not only that, but we could&nbsp;have reasoned that if the priest may defile himself on&nbsp;account of children’s death neither of whom he was obliged&nbsp;to honour during their lifetime, is it not logical that he has to&nbsp;do the same on account of his parents whom the Torah&nbsp;commanded him to honour and revere?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Answer: if the Torah had not spelled out both son and daughter, I might have thought that for preemies who did not&nbsp;survive their birth, the priest would also be permitted to defile&nbsp;themselves; therefore the Torah spelled out that only children&nbsp;who qualify for the title son or daughter, are a legitimate&nbsp;cause for the priest to defile himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another reason why the Torah had to write: לבנו ולבתו, “to defile themselves on account of his son or daughter,” is&nbsp;that son and daughter do not have the same relationships to&nbsp;their respective parents. A son is obligated to perform the&nbsp;commandment of honouring and revering his parents&nbsp;throughout his life, whereas a daughter’s obligation to do this&nbsp;takes second place to her honouring her husband upon&nbsp;marriage, as is evident that while her father could invalidate&nbsp;certain of her vows before marriage (depending on her age)&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> marriage only her husband has the right to do this.&nbsp;Therefore, the fact that they rank equally concerning the&nbsp;rights of their parents to defile themselves at their funerals&nbsp;had to be spelled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולאחיו ולאחותו</span><span class="font5">, “and concerning his brother or his sister, in case either of them died; this too could not be derived from&nbsp;the Torah having written this concerning son and daughter.&nbsp;Neither brother nor sister was obligated to perform acts by&nbsp;which to honour the other. We could have assumed therefore&nbsp;that the family ties to one another was therefore weaker than&nbsp;the other relatives mentioned by the Torah which would have&nbsp;prohibited them defiling themselves at each other’s funeral.&nbsp;The Torah also had to make a distinction between a sister&nbsp;who is still a virgin, i.e. too young to have been married, and&nbsp;one who has left her father’s house already to live with her&nbsp;husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,3. ולאחותו הבתולה הקרובה אליו </span><span class="font5">“and in respect of a sister, a virgin, and therefore still closely bound to him by&nbsp;family ties; regardless of whether she is a sister through a&nbsp;common mother or a common father; when </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">commented here on the sister including one who is already&nbsp;betrothed to a husband to be, he does not refer to some&nbsp;priest’s betrothed but not yet married fiancee. Similarly, when&nbsp;the Torah wrote about a sister who is a virgin, it is&nbsp;understood that she is below twelve years of age at the time&nbsp;of her death. Had she been married already she would have&nbsp;been part of her husband’s family, not that of her father. This&nbsp;is why the Torah used the expression לשארו, “to his family.”&nbsp;(verse 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר לא היתה לאיש</span><span class="font5">, “who had never belonged to a man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra,</span><span class="font5"> this somewhat clumsy wording implies that if that sister had lost her virginity through a cause&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">other</span><span class="font5"> than being penetrated by a man’s genital organ, she is&nbsp;considered as still a virgin with regard to the prohibition of&nbsp;her brother defiling herself at her funeral. If she lost her&nbsp;virginity through marital relations with her husband, he (her&nbsp;brother) may not do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לה יטמא</span><span class="font5">, “he will defile herself on her account;” not only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">may</span><span class="font5"> he defile himself at her funeral, but he is commanded to&nbsp;do so. If he declines to do so, the court forces him to do so.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5"> relates that a certain priest by the name of Joseph&nbsp;whose wife had died on the eve of Passover, and he did not&nbsp;want to defile himself at her funeral as then he would not be&nbsp;able to fulfill the commandment of eating from the paschal&nbsp;lamb on the night following, was forced by the sages to do so&nbsp;nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לה יטמא</span><span class="font5">, but he must not additionally engage in burying other people seeing that he is already ritually impure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is always forbidden for a priest-even nowadays when all priests (and non priests) are ritually impure, to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">add&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">impurity unnecessarily to their bodies seeing that they cannot&nbsp;purify their bodies in the absence of the ash of the red heifer.&nbsp;Ed.] The Rabbis derived this from the word לה, understanding&nbsp;it as restrictive, i.e. he may only defile himself through her&nbsp;body, not through anyone else’s that happens to be nearby.&nbsp;He may also not defile herself through contact with her limbs,&nbsp;if, for instance, she had been mutilated, and only parts of her&nbsp;body are available for burial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,4. לא יטמא בעל בעמיו</span><span class="font5">, “a husband (who is a priest) may not defile himself for his wife’s corpse;” if there are other&nbsp;people available who can do this without delay. According to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum,</span><span class="font5"> there is a letter ב missing here at the beginning&nbsp;of the word בעל which should be understood as if it had been&nbsp;written בבעל. The reference then would be to the High Priest&nbsp;not being allowed to bury his wife as he is the highest&nbsp;ranking priest. According to our author, this construction is&nbsp;not unique, and he cites Genesis 38,11 שבי אלמנה בית אביך,&nbsp;where Yehudah tells his daughter-in-law to spend the period&nbsp;of her widowhood in her father’s house pending his son&nbsp;Shelah becoming of age so that he could marry her. In other&nbsp;words, the word בית there should really have been: בבית, “in&nbsp;the house.” Our author claims that there are numerous such&nbsp;constructions to be found elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ibn Ezra,</span><span class="font5"> the verse speaks of an ordinary priest not being allowed to defile himself on his wife’s body,&nbsp;as she is not a blood relative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא יקרחה קרחה בראש</span><span class="font5">ם, “they shall not make a bald&nbsp;spot on their heads.” Although the word יקרחה is spelled with&nbsp;the letter ה at the end, it is read as if it had been spelled with&nbsp;the letter ו and the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shuruk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיו קודש</span><span class="font5">, “therefore they shall be holy.” This&nbsp;“holiness” also includes priests suffering a physical handicap&nbsp;which disqualifies them from performing service in the&nbsp;Temple.” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשה זונה</span><span class="font5">, “a woman who had engaged in a sexual&nbsp;relationship with a partner forbidden to Israelites;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If so, why would she on account of that be forbidden to marry an ordinary priest? We find only one single Rabbi in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> who rules that if an unmarried male Israelite had&nbsp;intercourse with an unmarried Israelite woman that she&nbsp;becomes forbidden to be married to a priest! The opinion of&nbsp;that Rabbi was never accepted as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachah.</span><span class="font5"> (Talmud,&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> folio 61) The only woman who is known by&nbsp;the stigma </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">zonah,</span><span class="font5"> as a harlot, is the one who had had sexual&nbsp;relations with someone disqualified as a priest, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">himself pointed out in his commentary on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ketuvot,</span><span class="font5"> foIio 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חללה</span><span class="font5">, “a woman who has been profaned;” the letter ו at the beginning of this word means “or,” and substitutes for או.&nbsp;The same applies to the letter ו in ואשה גרושה, “or a woman&nbsp;who had been divorced;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גרושה מאישה</span><span class="font5">, “divorced from her husband;” according to Rabbi Elazar ben Matya, this must be understood as distinct&nbsp;from someone no longer her husband, as he had abandoned&nbsp;her and emigrated overseas and has not been heard from. In&nbsp;the meantime this woman had remarried, and after a while&nbsp;her first husband turns up and claims her as his wife. Our&nbsp;verse comes to tell us that she can return to her former&nbsp;husband although in the meantime she had received a&nbsp;divorce decree from her second husband, and in the event&nbsp;that her first husband is a priest, she has not lost her status&nbsp;as being legally a priest’s wife. All this the sages derived&nbsp;from the otherwise superfluous words: “from her husband,”&nbsp;as who else could have divorced her? In the scenario just&nbsp;described her “marriage” to her second husband would not&nbsp;have been recognised as a marriage, hence her “divorce”&nbsp;from the second “husband,” was not a divorce at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;קדוש יהיה לך</span><span class="font5">, “he will be holy as far as you are&nbsp;concerned;” here too the adjective “holy” also applies to&nbsp;physically handicapped priests. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את אביה</span><span class="font5">, “she profanes her </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">father,”</span><span class="font5"> seeing that&nbsp;being a priest he is holy. (legally) and she also causes her&nbsp;father to become belittled in the eyes of his friends who know&nbsp;that he failed miserably in the way he raised his daughter,&nbsp;her guilt is therefore twofold. This is why the Torah decreed&nbsp;the harsher mode of execution by having molten lead poured&nbsp;down her throat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">היא מחללת</span><span class="font5">, the word היא is spelled with the letter .י</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באש תשרף</span><span class="font5">, “she will be burned by fire” (as explained.). Only she has to suffer this </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">harsher </span><span class="font5">mode of execution, not&nbsp;her partner. Her partner dies by the sword. (decapitation)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,10. את ראשו לא יפרע ובגדיו לו יפרו</span><span class="font5">ם , “he must not let his</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">hair grow wild, nor must he rend his garments” (as a means of showing the world that he is in mourning). He must not&nbsp;neglect his dignified appearance, even when in mourning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,11. ועל כל נפשות מת לא יבא</span><span class="font5">, “he shall not go to make contact with any corpse.” This is a warning to the High Priest&nbsp;not to be in the same covered airspace with any corpse.&nbsp;Seeing that this could have been derived already from the&nbsp;previous verse, it is clear that here the Torah includes&nbsp;ordinary priests in this legislation also. The linkage known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">g’zeyrah shava,</span><span class="font5"> is established by the word יבא which is used&nbsp;here in connection with the High Priest, followed by the&nbsp;unnecessary </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולאביו ולאמו לא יטמא “</span><span class="font5">he must not defile himself&nbsp;on the bodies of either his father or his mother.” This was&nbsp;included in the previous part of the verse that was all&nbsp;inclusive, by the words: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל נפשות מת</span><span class="font5">, “any dead bodies.” By&nbsp;repeating it, apparently, the sages learn that if a corpse is&nbsp;abandoned and has no one to arrange for his burial, the High&nbsp;Priest is commanded to defile himself on his account. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,14</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלמנה וגרושה</span><span class="font5">, “a widow or divorced woman;” seeing that the High Priest is not allowed to marry a widow,&nbsp;is it not obvious that he may not marry a divorced woman?&nbsp;Why did the Torah have to spell this out for us? Answer: I&nbsp;might have thought that seeing a widow is permitted for the&nbsp;ordinary priest to marry, a divorcee who is also forbidden to&nbsp;an ordinary priest and who is certainly forbidden to the High&nbsp;Priest, that if the High Priest had contravened this law, the&nbsp;son from such a union is not only no priest but has the status&nbsp;of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mamzer,</span><span class="font5"> someone who is not allowed to marry a Jewish&nbsp;woman. By phrasing it as it does, the Torah limited the fallout&nbsp;from such a contravention to demoting the issue to be like an&nbsp;ordinary Israelite, not a priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Or, if the Torah had written only that the High Priest must not marry a divorced woman, I would have thought that&nbsp;the son of a marriage between a High priest and a divorced&nbsp;woman would indeed not be a priest, whereas the son of a&nbsp;union between a High Priest and a widow would be&nbsp;considered as a normal priest; therefore the Torah has to&nbsp;state that the consequences are more serious than we would&nbsp;have thought. In short, the unnecessary word גרושה is&nbsp;interpreted as lenient, whereas the unnecessary word אלמנה&nbsp;is interpreted as additional severity. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחללה זנה</span><span class="font5">, “or a profaned woman or a harlot;“ the missing letter ו in the word זונה is comparable to the missing letter ו in&nbsp;Chabakuk 3,11, “their habitation” in the word זבלה which&nbsp;should have been זבולה, “its respective habitation (orbit)” or&nbsp;as in Deuteronomy 32,42: וכפר אדמתו עמו, where the ו is&nbsp;missing at the beginning, so that it will be understood: “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">and&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">His people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אלה לא יקח</span><span class="font5">, “these (who have been mentioned) he must not marry.” (publicly, in a ceremony of a wedding)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אם בתולה מעמיו</span><span class="font5">, “but he must marry a virgin of his own people.” If she is not a virgin he would have transgressed a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">positive</span><span class="font5"> commandment. (The transgression is not punishable&nbsp;by lashes. If you were to ask what is different here from the&nbsp;commandment that the Passover lamb must only be eaten&nbsp;broiled on the fire, not boiled or steamed, where the sages&nbsp;interpreted this not as a positive commandment but as a&nbsp;negative commandment (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;41) and they decreed that someone not doing so would&nbsp;receive lashes on account of having transgressed two&nbsp;negative commandments, one for having eaten it raw, the&nbsp;other for not having eaten it broiled? Here too the&nbsp;commandment of marrying a virgin is a positive&nbsp;commandment? Answer: the words: כי אם בתולה, “only a&nbsp;virgin,” refer to the part of the verse that began with the&nbsp;words, and refer to what follows; whereas in the verse&nbsp;speaking of how to eat the Passover lamb, the words כי אם&nbsp;צלי אש, refer to what had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">already</span><span class="font5"> happened, something which&nbsp;is not followed by another positive commandment, i.e. יקח&nbsp;אשה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,15. ולא יחלל זרעו, </span><span class="font5">“so that he will not profane his seed,” by marrying these profaned people secretly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,17. איש מזרעך לדורותם</span><span class="font5">, “any of your descendants (afflicted with a physical deformity;)” Rabbi Elazar ben&nbsp;Azaryah uses the wording of this verse to rule that a minor,-son of a priest- is unfit to perform service in the Temple, even&nbsp;if he is physically perfect. As to the question of from what age&nbsp;such a minor is qualified to perform service in the Temple, he&nbsp;rules that when he has grown 2 pubic hairs this&nbsp;demonstrates that he is sufficiently developed physically. In&nbsp;spite of this ruling, his colleagues, the adult priests do not&nbsp;admit him to perform such service until he has reached the&nbsp;age of 20 years. [They imply that spiritual maturity is required&nbsp;also. Ed.] (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר יהיה בו מום</span><span class="font5">, “who is afflicted with a physical blemish;” after the Torah had made an overall statement&nbsp;regarding the holiness of the priests, it begins to list&nbsp;blemishes which will disqualify individual priests from&nbsp;performing service in the Temple. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,18 'כי כל איש וגו</span><span class="font5">, “for any man who is afflicted with a blemish” the Torah lists the reason that such priests may not&nbsp;perform service in the Temple as being that seeing that they&nbsp;represent the whole Jewish community, it would not seem&nbsp;appropriate that this community dispatches blemished people&nbsp;as their representatives at the Court of the King of Kings.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר בו מום, “</span><span class="font5">even if he had been born with the physical abnormality;”</span></p>

(Example: Passover&nbsp;lamb) In order to prevent such a misunderstanding, the&nbsp;Torah added the extra words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אך אל הפרכת ואל המזבה</span><span class="font5">, “but to the dividing curtain&nbsp;inside the Sanctuary, and to the altar he must not come&nbsp;near.” (on account of his blemish); if the Torah had only&nbsp;quoted the example of the dividing curtain I might have&nbsp;thought that seeing that the dividing curtain is inside the&nbsp;Sanctuary, the blemished person could also not approach&nbsp;the golden altar whereas it would be all right to approach the&nbsp;copper altar outside the Sanctuary. On the other hand, if the&nbsp;Torah had only forbidden the blemished priest to approach&nbsp;the altar, I would have thought that the reason is because the&nbsp;sacrificial animals are slaughtered in it. Seeing that the&nbsp;dividing curtain did not have anything to do with the actual&nbsp;slaughtering of the offering, I might have thought that even a&nbsp;blemished priest could approach it; in order to prevent such&nbsp;faulty reasoning on our part the Torah added a few words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אני ה' מקדשם</span><span class="font5">, “for I the Lord, sanctify them.” The Torah is speaking about sanctifying the dividing curtain and the&nbsp;altar, and that is why a priest with a blemish is not fit to&nbsp;approach them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,24. ואל כל בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “as well as to all the Children of Israel.” They are warned not to entrust their offerings to&nbsp;priests who are afflicted with blemishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,2. ולא יחללו את שם קדשי</span><span class="font5">, “so that they will not profane My holy Name.” The whole purpose of a sacrificial offering is&nbsp;to honour My holy name; anyone presenting such while in a&nbsp;state of ritual impurity will desecrate it instead of honouring it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר הם מקדישים</span><span class="font5">, “which they are sanctifying;” and do not profane. The heading of this verse applies to both My holy&nbsp;name and the offerings sanctified in its honour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,4. והוא צרוע או זב</span><span class="font5">, and he is afflicted with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> or has had involuntary seminal issue;” The Torah here uses a&nbsp;form of construction known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lo zu af zu,</span><span class="font5"> “not only this but&nbsp;even that,” meaning that not only the more severe affliction&nbsp;but even the relatively minor affliction is also a cause for the&nbsp;prohibition described, i.e. not to eat holy things. Not only a&nbsp;ritual impurity originating in one’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">own</span><span class="font5"> body is the cause of&nbsp;the prohibition but merely coming into contact with a corpse&nbsp;are similarly a cause for this prohibition. On the other hand,&nbsp;not only contact with a corpse but even a seminal emission&nbsp;from one’s own body that can be purified by immersion in a&nbsp;ritual bath on the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> evening, is also included in this&nbsp;legislation. Conversely, even a ritual impurity due merely to&nbsp;an </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">external</span><span class="font5"> cause such as touching a corpse, is similarly&nbsp;triggering this prohibition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד אשר יטהר</span><span class="font5">, “until he will become purified.” A process completed by the setting of the sun. (Compare verse 7 in our&nbsp;chapter)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">22.5.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר יטמא לו</span><span class="font5">, “whereby he may become ritually&nbsp;unclean;” the word לו in this verse means בשבילו, “on its&nbsp;account,” on account of the creeping animal. It is parallel to&nbsp;Exodus 1,10, where Pharaoh exerted his people to outsmart&nbsp;the Israelites since he could not outnumber them and said:&nbsp;הבה נתחכמה לו, “let us instead try to be smarter than it,” i.e. “on&nbsp;account of its numerical superiority.” It is also similar to&nbsp;Esther 6,4: אשר הכין לו, “which he had prepared on his&nbsp;account.” (On Mordechai’s account, in order to hang him&nbsp;from that gallows). Our author cites more parallels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.6. כי אם רחץ בשרו במים</span><span class="font5">, “unless he has first washed his&nbsp;body in water. (ritual bath) In case we understood this as&nbsp;piecemeal washing of the limbs of one’s body, the Torah&nbsp;adds the word: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במים </span><span class="font5">in water (all at the same time). This is&nbsp;why the words: “when the sun sets he will be ritually clean,”&nbsp;is of importance here. Just as sunset is not a gradual&nbsp;process but it occurs at the same time, so the whole body&nbsp;has to be washed at the same time. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובא השמש וטהר ואחר יאכל</span><span class="font5">, “when the sun has set</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and he has become ritually pure, he may eat, etc.” It is the setting of the sun which causes the purified person to be&nbsp;allows to eat </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah,</span><span class="font5"> </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">second degree </span><span class="font5">holy matters, not the&nbsp;immersion in the ritual bath preceding that, although that had&nbsp;been a prerequisite. On the other hand, the line:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואחר יאכל מן הקדשים</span><span class="font5">, “and afterwards he may eat from the holy matters,” i.e. holy matters of the first degree. If -as&nbsp;apparent in some manuscripts the order were to be reversed-it would not make sense if he could already eat holy things of&nbsp;the first degree, why would he have to await sunset to be&nbsp;allowed to eat </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah,</span><span class="font5"> which is inferior in its degree of&nbsp;holiness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, one may argue that seeing that a non priest is not allowed to eat </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah</span><span class="font5"> even when ritually&nbsp;pure, this requires additional steps when purification is&nbsp;required for the priest. Still another consideration is the fact&nbsp;that when something holy has been allowed to become&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">piggul,</span><span class="font5"> unfit to eat because it has not been eaten during the&nbsp;time prescribed for it, a restriction unknown in respect of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah,</span><span class="font5"> this could be a reason why the Torah had to&nbsp;mention both separately. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,8. נבלה וטרפה</span><span class="font5">, “that which dies of itself, or has been&nbsp;torn;” the Torah refers to the carcass of a pure bird, (one that&nbsp;could be eaten if it had been ritually slaughtered) and of flesh&nbsp;from sacrificial meat of mammals which could have been&nbsp;eaten, had it not been removed, but which because it had&nbsp;been removed from the sacred domain within which it could&nbsp;have been eaten had now become </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">treif;</span><span class="font5"> or similarly since&nbsp;such a bird had at one point been fit to eat, it is compared to&nbsp;something that had died of its own accord. The priests are&nbsp;not to eat of it as it would confer ritual impurity on them.&nbsp;(Compare Ezekiel 44,31)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,10. תושב כהן ושכיר</span><span class="font5">, “a tenant of a priest or a hired servant;” you could have thought that if a tenant or physically&nbsp;owned slave of a priest is forbidden to eat of these holy&nbsp;things, it is only logical that a hired hand whose has been&nbsp;hired for a limited period only cannot eat from it either, so&nbsp;why did the Torah have to spell this out for us?; The reason&nbsp;is that if the word תושב alone had been written, I would have&nbsp;thought that it refers to someone hired only for a limited&nbsp;period; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,12-13.ובת כהן....ובת כהן</span><span class="font5">, why does each verse have to be written separately and have to be introduced by the&nbsp;words: ובת כהן, “and the daughter if a priest?” We must&nbsp;understand these verses as follows: “if this daughter of a&nbsp;priest gets married to someone who is not a priest, i.e.&nbsp;someone who had actually not qualified for marrying a&nbsp;priest’s daughter, as described in the Talmud, tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> folio 68, where the subject is the widow of a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">High&nbsp;Priest</span><span class="font5">; seeing that this woman had married someone&nbsp;forbidden to her, she has forfeited the right to eat </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">something that had been her right from birth until such time.&nbsp;[If the Torah had not written that after becoming divorced or&nbsp;widowed such a woman if she returned to her father’s house&nbsp;could resume eating </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">trumah,</span><span class="font5"> if she was still childless, I would&nbsp;not have known that while married to a non priest she had&nbsp;been forbidden to do so. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תהיה אלמנה או גרושה</span><span class="font5">, “the daughter of a priest&nbsp;who after having married a non priest had become widowed&nbsp;or divorced; the Torah speaks of a woman divorced or&nbsp;widowed from an Israelite or a Levite;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלמנה וגרושה</span><span class="font5">, why does the Torah not only write: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גרושה </span><span class="font5">without adding: אלמנה widow;? I would then have reasoned&nbsp;that if even a divorcee would be permitted to revert to the&nbsp;status of being single in her father’s house, a widowed&nbsp;woman surely would be able to do no less; this is why it says:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלמנה וזרע אין לה, </span><span class="font5">“a widow who has no child.” By the same&nbsp;token, if the Torah had only written: אלמנה, “widow,” and had&nbsp;not mentioned a divorced woman, I would have reasoned&nbsp;that a widow who did not have a child could return to her&nbsp;father’s house and her former status as belonging to a priest&nbsp;would be reinstated, but a divorced woman would be&nbsp;reinstated even if she did have children from her ex husband&nbsp;who is not a priest. This is why the Torah had to write: גרושה&nbsp;וזרע אין לה “divorced but childless.” In the case of the widow&nbsp;the addition of “without child,” was a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">restriction</span><span class="font5"> for the widow,&nbsp;whereas the same words were an </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">easing</span><span class="font5"> of the rules for the&nbsp;widow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושבה אל בית אביה</span><span class="font5">, “when she returns to live in the house of her father.” This excludes the case where because she&nbsp;had no children she is awaiting a levirate marriage to the&nbsp;brother or one of them, of her late husband. This is not&nbsp;called: “returning to the house of her father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כנעוריה</span><span class="font5">, as when she was less than 12 years and 6 months old, i.e. when she was not yet pregnant. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסף חמישיתו</span><span class="font5">, “and he shall add one fifth to the&nbsp;value of the forbidden holy food that he has eaten.” What is&nbsp;meant is that after having added the penalty, the total will&nbsp;represent 20% more than the original, i.e. the sinner had&nbsp;actually added 25% to the original value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,16.והשיאו אותם עון אשמם</span><span class="font5">, “and so cause them to bear the guilt brought on by their iniquity.” This is a reference to&nbsp;the people who desecrated holy things by feeding them to&nbsp;non priests. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">They</span><span class="font5"> will have to bear the burden of their sin, not&nbsp;the people who ate them, who were unaware of their status&nbsp;as being holy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את קדשיהם</span><span class="font5">, ”their holy things.” This teaches that the farmers can give their </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah</span><span class="font5"> to any priest of their choosing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מקדשם</span><span class="font5">, “who sanctify them.” This refers to holy matters that had been sanctified by Israelites</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'איש איש וגו</span><span class="font5">, from the repetition here of the word&nbsp;איש איש, meaning: “anyone,” we learn according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">that the donations to the Jewish Temple by gentiles are&nbsp;acceptable. If you were to ask why </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> needed this verse&nbsp;to learn this from indirectly, when we could have inferred this&nbsp;from a very specific verse in verse 25 of our chapter, where&nbsp;the Torah writes: ומיד כל בן נכר לא תקריבו את אלו, “and when&nbsp;donated from any gentile you must not offer on the altar any&nbsp;of these,” it is clear that the only kind of offerings from&nbsp;gentiles we must not present on the altar of our temple are&nbsp;blemished beasts, but beasts that are not blemished but are&nbsp;perfect specimens of their respective categories, may&nbsp;certainly be offered on behalf of the gentiles, the answer is&nbsp;that from that verse we could have derived that if a Jewish&nbsp;priest presented a perfect specimen donated by a gentile he&nbsp;would transgress only against an ordinary negative&nbsp;commandment, but if he presented a blemished animal he&nbsp;did not transgress also a positive commandment at the same&nbsp;time. At the same time, if the Torah had only written our&nbsp;verse here, I would have thought that gentiles may even&nbsp;present animals that are blemished as sacrifices on the altar&nbsp;of the Jewish Temple. Not only that, I would have thought&nbsp;that if gentiles wanted to offer sin offerings on the altar of the&nbsp;Jewish Temple this would also be acceptable; this is why the&nbsp;Torah had to approve only </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nedarim</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nedavot,</span><span class="font5"> free will&nbsp;offerings of the category of gifts to G’d, by writing what it did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לרצונכם תמים זכר</span><span class="font5">, “without blemish, male, that you&nbsp;will be well received,” earlier in the portion of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vayikra,1,3,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;Torah spoke of mandatory offerings, when mentioning that&nbsp;the offering needs to be such that G’d will look at the donor&nbsp;with fondness. No mention was made there of any blemishes&nbsp;in the animal offered. The author wonders why the Torah&nbsp;here did not mention other categories of sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.21</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואיש כי יקריב</span><span class="font5">, “and when an individual will bring a&nbsp;peace-offering, etc.;” only individuals can offer this type of&nbsp;peace-offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לפלא נדר, “</span><span class="font5">in fulfillment of a vow</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">there are two diametrically opposite ways of explaining the word לפלא. One&nbsp;is the one we just used, the other we find in a verse in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 17,8: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יפלא ממך דבר</span><span class="font5">, where it means “if&nbsp;something is concealed from you;” another example where&nbsp;the same expression is used in a similarly contradictory&nbsp;manner is the word דשן, and לדשנו, in Exodus 27,3 which can&nbsp;mean to remove ashes and dross, and which can mean: to&nbsp;saturate, to have a surfeit of, (in the positive sense, such as&nbsp;when applied to a harvest.) Also, in Zachariah 3,4 מחלצות,&nbsp;where it means fancy priestly robes, whereas in Psalms 7,5,&nbsp;ואחלצה צוררי, it means: “I stripped my oppressors, (removed&nbsp;their protective clothing)” The author quotes another example&nbsp;or two of the same phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;או שבור</span><span class="font5">, “or broken;” just as we have the&nbsp;expression שבר יד, and ,שבר רגל, describing a broken hand or&nbsp;a broken foot as examples of blemishes seen by all, so here&nbsp;too it describes a very visible blemish due to a fracture of a&nbsp;bone, that is not visible to all as it his hidden by one’s&nbsp;clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חרוץ</span><span class="font5">, “maimed,” as in Kings I 20,40: משפטך אתה חרצת, “you yourself have released (decreed) it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יבלת</span><span class="font5">, scabbed;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[the next four verses detail certain blemishes which disqualify animals as sacrifices to be offered on the altar,&nbsp;regardless of whether they have been donated by Israelites&nbsp;or gentiles; in the case of the latter, they must not even be&nbsp;accepted by the Temple </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">treasury</span><span class="font5"> as gifts while still alive so&nbsp;that they could be sold by him and the proceeds be used for&nbsp;repairs of the Temple. The Torah also forbids us to inflict&nbsp;these kinds of blemishes on human beings deliberately; one&nbsp;of the most serious such disfigurations would be castrating&nbsp;either animals or human beings. I have just summarized this.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The author raises the question of whether the prophet Samuel castrated Agag, King of the Amalekites before killing&nbsp;him, and concludes that under the circumstances prevailing&nbsp;that was justified. (Samuel I 7,9, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> Shmuel on the&nbsp;subject. Ed.] Apparently, the prohibition was limited to when&nbsp;it was done inside the boundaries of the Land of Israel, as&nbsp;stated in verse 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,27</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שור או כשב או עז</span><span class="font5">, “a bullock or sheep or goat;” these animals are named here to remind us that animals that&nbsp;have the distinctive features making them pure, as stated in&nbsp;Leviticus chapter eleven, are nonetheless not fit as sacrifices&nbsp;if they are the product of crossbreeding, or even if they were&nbsp;born by caesarean birth as opposed to being born from the&nbsp;womb. This is why the Torah added the words: כי יולד, “when&nbsp;born.” The word עז in our verse but not in verse 28, is meant&nbsp;to exclude any animal that does not look like its mother, i.e.&nbsp;cannot easily be identified as the same species though we&nbsp;witnessed by which animal it had been born. Such animals&nbsp;do not qualify for ritual slaughter. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יולד</span><span class="font5">, the restriction of caesarean birth do not apply to human beings, who are treated in all respects as if born&nbsp;normally. [The exception being that a son born by caesarean&nbsp;incision does not qualify as “firstborn,” the father not having&nbsp;to redeem such a son. Ed.] He may offer it as a sacrifice, just&nbsp;like an animal born from the womb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה שבעת ימים</span><span class="font5">, “it has to remain for a period of seven days;” these seven days are applicable to an animal after it&nbsp;had gone through five or nine full months of pregnancy&nbsp;(depending on what species it is) in its mother’s womb; if it&nbsp;had been born prematurely, or we have reason to think so,&nbsp;seven days are not enough before it qualifies as a potential&nbsp;sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תחת אמו, </span><span class="font5">“with its mother;” the legislation does not apply to an orphaned calf. This commandment had already been&nbsp;written in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Mishpatim, 22,29,</span><span class="font5"> in connection with the&nbsp;firstborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ירצה לקרבן, </span><span class="font5">“it becomes welcome as a sacrificial offering;” after the Torah dealt with offerings that are not&nbsp;welcome due to certain circumstances, it now deals with&nbsp;those that are welcome, for instance from the eighth day&nbsp;onwards of the life of the animal in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,31. 'ועשיתם אותם, אני ה</span><span class="font5">, “you will carry them out, I am The Lord.” G’d uses this expression when He wants to&nbsp;impress the reader with the fact that He examines our minds&nbsp;and hearts. Here it is treated as separate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומיום השמיני</span><span class="font5">, “and commencing on the eighth day of its life;” in the same legislation in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishpatim,</span><span class="font5"> the version is&nbsp;slightly different, i.e. “on the eighth day,” instead of “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">from</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;eighth day onward.” The reason is that there the Torah&nbsp;speaks of the first day of its life that that animal is subject to&nbsp;be sanctified as being a sacrificial animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,28, ושור</span><span class="font5">, “and a bullock,” as opposed to a free&nbsp;roaming mammal;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או שה</span><span class="font5">, “or a lamb,” as opposed to a bird.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אותו ואת בנו</span><span class="font5">, the older generation, i.e. the “mother” or “father;” the one who models itself after the mother, i.e. a&nbsp;female calf. This would exclude a male lamb. According to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> slaughtering a male animal and its </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">male</span><span class="font5"> offspring on&nbsp;the same day is not prohibited. Let us agree that there is no&nbsp;penalty of lashes for slaughtering both “father” and “son” on&nbsp;the same day, nonetheless there is a prohibition to do so.&nbsp;This has been spelled out in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin,</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;79. [Rabbi Chavell, in his annotations, shows that later&nbsp;authorities are all agreed on this. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;דבר אל בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “speak to the Children of Israel;”&nbsp;this is a call for them to assemble in order to hear what he&nbsp;has to say to them. Once they had assembled, the Torah&nbsp;tells Moses what he is to say to them,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואמרת אליהם, </span><span class="font5">and say to them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלה הם מועדי</span><span class="font5">, “these are My appointed seasons.” The verse speaks of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Sabbath. The plural mode in the word&nbsp;מועדי, is used, as there are so many Sabbaths every year.&nbsp;(Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בכל מושבותיכם, </span><span class="font5">“in all your dwellings.” The Sabbath&nbsp;laws apply regardless of whether you are in the Holy Land or&nbsp;in exile. Up to now the Torah had dealt with different kinds of&nbsp;vows made by people, resulting in those being offered as&nbsp;animal sacrifices on the altar in the Temple. On those days&nbsp;everybody is required to offer sacrifices in the Temple&nbsp;regardless of having vowed to do so or not. It also describes&nbsp;the type of work that must not be performed on these&nbsp;festivals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בין הערבים, פסח</span><span class="font5">, “at dusk, a Passover;” on the eve&nbsp;of the first day of Passover. The night between the fourteenth&nbsp;and the fifteenth of that month is called “Passover.” The&nbsp;reason is that during that night the people were busy&nbsp;consuming the meat of that offering. The remaining days of&nbsp;that festival are called: חג המצות, “the festival of the&nbsp;unleavened bread.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שבעת ימים מצות תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “you will eat unleavened&nbsp;bread for seven days.” The unleavened bread a person eats&nbsp;during those seven days are accounted as his fulfilling this&nbsp;commandment on Passover, the exception are the&nbsp;thanksgiving </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">offerings</span><span class="font5">, part of which are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chametz,</span><span class="font5"> leavened&nbsp;bread, and mostly unleavened wafers which may not be&nbsp;offered on these days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ראשית קצירכם</span><span class="font5">, “the first fruit of your harvest;” it&nbsp;would not be good manners to eat of this harvest </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> your&nbsp;bringing a gift to the Lord acknowledging His share in your&nbsp;successful harvest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ממחרת השבת</span><span class="font5">, “on the day following the first day of&nbsp;Passover.” We have one verse in which we are commanded&nbsp;to eat unleavened bread for seven days (here), and another&nbsp;in which we are commanded to eat leavened bread during&nbsp;six days. (Deuteronomy 16,8) How do we reconcile these two&nbsp;verses? During periods when you are unable to eat from last&nbsp;year’s harvest (because there is none left after the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">year, you are allowed to eat from the new harvest during 6&nbsp;days of this festival. How do we fulfill the commandment of&nbsp;“on the day following the Sabbath?” We understand the word&nbsp;Sabbath here as the first day of the festival. (If we were to&nbsp;wait until after the whole of the festival has elapsed, we&nbsp;would have ignored the commandment contained in that&nbsp;verse. Annotation by Rabbi Chavell)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,13. ומנחתו שני עשרונים סלת, </span><span class="font5">and its gift offering, “two tenths of fine flour, etc.;” this was double the usual amount&nbsp;as it was the first offering presented from the new harvest.&nbsp;The additional amount of flour presented symbolizes that the&nbsp;harvest has been bountiful. Seeing that we do not find a&nbsp;parallel when it comes to the number of sheep offered on this&nbsp;occasion in addition to the breads, we mention in our&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph</span><span class="font5"> prayers on the festival the respective components&nbsp;of each of these offerings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some opinions hold that the one “tenth” of fine flour mentioned here was the “omer,” and they bring as proof that&nbsp;the libation accompanying that offering was not&nbsp;commensurate with the two “tenths” of fine flour mentioned&nbsp;here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This argument is without merit, as the two “tenths” mentioned here were wheat flour, whereas the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“omer”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">consisted of barley. The expression סלת for finely ground&nbsp;flour is used exclusively with flour made from wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונסכה יין רביעית ההין, </span><span class="font5">“and its accompanying libation, one tenth of a measure known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hin,</span><span class="font5"> of wine.&quot; Rabbi Eliezer, in&nbsp;the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot</span><span class="font5"> folio 89, points out that the&nbsp;Torah uses the feminine mode for the word ונסכה, i.e. it is&nbsp;read as if it had been spelled with the masculine pronoun&nbsp;ending ו, although spelled with feminine ending </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ה</span><span class="font5">. What is&nbsp;the reason for this strange phenomenon? The libation&nbsp;appropriate for a gift offering, known as מנחה in Hebrew is&nbsp;appropriately referred to in the feminine mode, seeing that&nbsp;the noun מנחה, gift offering, is a feminine noun. On the other&nbsp;hand, normally the libation accompanying the gift offering&nbsp;consists of oil, whereas here it consists of wine, יין. It is&nbsp;therefore not correct to speak of a doubling of the libation, as&nbsp;only the amount of flour has been doubled. Moreover,&nbsp;libations consisting of oil were a later addition in the history of&nbsp;the Jewish people in the desert, having been introduced only&nbsp;in Numbers chapter 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומנחתו ושני עשרונים, ונסכו יין</span><span class="font5">, “and its gift offering, two tenths of fine flour and its libation, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">wine;</span><span class="font5"> Seeing that this&nbsp;libation was not introduced until Numbers 28, the reference&nbsp;to it here is grammatically ambiguous; we find another&nbsp;example of such an ambiguity in verse 18 of our chapter:&nbsp;שבעת כבשים ופר אחד ואילים שנים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">seven male sheep and one&nbsp;bullock and two rams,” which are offered on account of the&nbsp;two loaves representing the firstling fruit of the new wheat&nbsp;harvest on the festival of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot;</span><span class="font5"> The Torah adds here:&nbsp;“and their respective gift offerings and libations,” (without&nbsp;spelling out what the latter consisted of.) All the other&nbsp;sacrifices offered on the festivals, mentioned here without&nbsp;specifics, are all described in the feminine mode, as only in&nbsp;Numbers chapter 28 they are considered as complete, as&nbsp;there the libations accompanying them are spelled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולחם</span><span class="font5">, “and the bread etc;” five species of grain&nbsp;when baked, qualify for the description “bread,” they are the&nbsp;ones that are liable to become </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chametz,</span><span class="font5"> leavened, if their&nbsp;dough are allowed to rise. “Baked dough” made from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kitniyot,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">legumes, such as rice, maize, lentils, etc., the dough of which&nbsp;does not become leavened, does not qualify for the definition&nbsp;“bread” in the Torah. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וספרתם לכם ממחרת השבת</span><span class="font5">, “you will begin to count&nbsp;for yourselves, commencing with the day after the first day of&nbsp;Passover;” seeing that there are seven weeks between the&nbsp;beginning of the barley harvest and the beginning of the&nbsp;wheat harvest, periods when the commandment of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">is observed in earnest, the prophet (Jeremiah, 5,24) has&nbsp;already categorized them as: שבועות חוקת קציר ישמר לנו, “Who&nbsp;keeps for our benefit the weeks appointed for the harvest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments: “seven weeks during which G’d decreed for us two laws, that of the harvesting of the “</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">and the presentation of the first two loaves of the new wheat&nbsp;harvest.” He sees to it that we can harvest these two species&nbsp;at the appropriate time of the year. Seeing that such an&nbsp;important part of our livelihood depends on these two&nbsp;harvests, it is easy to understand that the Torah expects us&nbsp;to keep the counting of these days meticulously. Just as we&nbsp;have to count days we also have to count weeks, at the end&nbsp;of which period we sanctify the fiftieth day after completing&nbsp;the seventh week. We have to do the same concerning&nbsp;counting for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> year and the arrival of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">year. The emphasis of this whole paragraph is on the&nbsp;respective concepts of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel.</span><span class="font5"> There are a total&nbsp;of 49 potential disasters that the Torah warns us of if we fail&nbsp;to observe these two basic positive commandments. [The</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">number 49 symbolizes the number of days we fail to assimilate the social significance of those laws to ensure that&nbsp;no extremes of rich and poor will become permanent&nbsp;features in our land. [My choice of words. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ממחרת השבת</span><span class="font5">, if you were to say that these words refer to the day following the original Sabbath, i.e. the first day of the&nbsp;week, you would on occasion have to count fifty two days&nbsp;instead of forty nine days or even fifty four days or fifty six&nbsp;days, neither less nor more. This is why the first day of&nbsp;Passover cannot occur on either: Monday, Wednesday or&nbsp;Friday. How then could I fulfill the commandment implied in&nbsp;the words “on the day following the Sabbath?” This can only&nbsp;be done by understanding the word שבת, as referring to the&nbsp;first day of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">festival</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,16. תספרו חמשים יום</span><span class="font5">, “you shall count fifty days.” We need to recite a blessing when we count, as opposed to&nbsp;when a woman after her period counts seven days of her&nbsp;purification days. Her count is not necessarily consecutive,&nbsp;as if she sees a drop of blood that emanated from her&nbsp;vagina, this invalidates the count. She has no control over&nbsp;this, whereas we, who are counting consecutive days, know&nbsp;beforehand that the sun rises every day consecutively.&nbsp;(Compare commentary of our author on Leviticus 15,28)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על הלחם</span><span class="font5">, “with the bread.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשיתם שעיר עזים</span><span class="font5">, “you shall offer one he-goat;”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments here: I might have thought that the seven&nbsp;male sheep and the male goat mentioned here are the same&nbsp;as those mentioned in Numbers 28,27. However, when you&nbsp;look at the bullocks and rams, you will note that they are not&nbsp;identical, as there we read about two bullocks and one ram.&nbsp;Furthermore, if you were to assume that what is described&nbsp;here is part of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph</span><span class="font5"> offerings presented on the&nbsp;festivals, what is the difference between the offering&nbsp;presented on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot</span><span class="font5"> from the ones recorded in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat&nbsp;Pinchas?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושני כבשים בני שנה, </span><span class="font5">and two male sheep less than a year old. Rabbi Shimon, quoted by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra,</span><span class="font5"> asks for what sin these&nbsp;two sheep are supposed to atone? He answers that they are&nbsp;to atone for inadvertent ritual impurity incurred in the Temple&nbsp;or in connection with the service in the Temple. He adds that&nbsp;if the first animal achieved atonement, what was the second&nbsp;one in aid of? He answers that it would atone for additional&nbsp;impurity incurred in the interval. He adds that according to&nbsp;strict rules such offerings should therefore be offered around&nbsp;the clock, as inadvertent impurity is liable to occur at any&nbsp;moment; however, G’d decided to save His people the&nbsp;additional expense. [There appears to be a misprint&nbsp;somewhere because while the male goats served for&nbsp;atonement, the male </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">sheep</span><span class="font5"> were peace offerings, not sin&nbsp;offerings. The interested reader who finds this “misprint”&nbsp;incredible, is referred to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Malbim’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary on this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והניף הכהן אותם</span><span class="font5">, “the priest will wave them;” the&nbsp;two sheep for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot</span><span class="font5"> festival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על לחם הבכורים</span><span class="font5">, “with the bread of the first fruit of the wheat harvest;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על שני כבשים</span><span class="font5">, “with the two lambs.” Not literally with, but “next to,” as explained by the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 62.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קדש יהיה לה' לכהן, </span><span class="font5">it will be holy to the Lord;” for the priest.” No non priest may eat any parts of them, as opposed&nbsp;to other types of peace offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וקראתם בעצם היום הזה מקרא קדש</span><span class="font5">, “and you will&nbsp;proclaim a holy convocation on this very day.” The reason&nbsp;why the Torah does not spell out in which month this occurs,&nbsp;and on what date of this month, as it does with all the other&nbsp;festivals, is if it had done so, the people would not have been&nbsp;counting weeks and days, but would simply have contented&nbsp;themselves with observing the festival on its appropriate&nbsp;date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The counting was an important feature of these weeks as we have pointed out on verse 15. Nowadays, in the&nbsp;absence of the Temple, our being in exile, and having&nbsp;adopted (therefore?) a permanent calendar, the fiftieth day&nbsp;after the first day of Passover automatically occurs on the&nbsp;same date in the month of Sivan, the date on which the Ten&nbsp;Commandments (orally) were given to the Jewish people at&nbsp;Mount Sinai. In light of the fact that the counting is no longer&nbsp;associated with the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">date</span><span class="font5"> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot</span><span class="font5"> as that date was known,&nbsp;the benediction commencing with שהחיינו וקימנו לזמן הזה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">Who&nbsp;has kept us alive and well until this point in time,” is not&nbsp;recited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.22. ובקוצרכם את קציר ארצכם</span><span class="font5">, “when you reap the harvests of your land, etc.;” seeing that the principal period of&nbsp;harvesting commences around the time of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot</span><span class="font5">, the&nbsp;Torah chose to speak of this season first, when discussing&nbsp;special laws of benefit to the poor connected with the act of&nbsp;collecting the harvest. Examples are: leaving a corner of the&nbsp;field uncut for the poor to help themselves, and not gleaning&nbsp;anything the reapers had dropped by mistake. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וידבר ה' אל משה</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord spoke to Moses;” The&nbsp;reason why this sequence has been interrupted by telling us&nbsp;that G’d addressed Moses separately about the days of New&nbsp;Year and the Day of Atonement, something He had not done&nbsp;when speaking about Shavuot, is because each one of those&nbsp;festivals is something in its own right, as distinct from&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot</span><span class="font5"> which is inextricably linked to Passover as the&nbsp;reaping of the beginning of the barley harvest begins on the&nbsp;second day of Passover and the counting of the seven&nbsp;weeks links Passover to Shavuot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;באחד לחדש השביעי</span><span class="font5">, “on the first day of the seventh&nbsp;month, etc.” you observe a festival, שבתון on the first day of&nbsp;that month and it occurs on a Sabbath, you are to observe a&nbsp;symbolic act as the substitute for blowing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar,</span><span class="font5"> called&nbsp;here זכרון תרועה, in accordance with the rules established by&nbsp;our sages. On account of this absence of blowing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">on the Sabbath, the sages added the extra words יום זכרון&nbsp;תרועה, in the relevant portions of the principal prayer known&nbsp;as עמידה, the prayer to be recited while standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the portion known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pinchas,</span><span class="font5"> where all the sacrifices offered especially on the festivals are listed in&nbsp;detail, the word: זכרון, “in memory of,” is missing, the Torah&nbsp;describing that day only as יום תרועה, “the day on which the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’ruah</span><span class="font5"> sound of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar</span><span class="font5"> is to be blown. (Numbers 29,1) In&nbsp;other words, in regular years when that date does not occur&nbsp;on a Sabbath, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar</span><span class="font5"> is to be blown. The day is referred&nbsp;to in our relevant prayers as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yom hazikaron,</span><span class="font5"> a day of&nbsp;remembrance, the means of that remembrance, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">not being stated. The purpose of the blowing of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar</span><span class="font5"> in&nbsp;all parts of the world, regardless of whether we are in exile, is&nbsp;to bring ourselves to favourable consideration by the Creator,&nbsp;Who, on that day decides which of us are going to survive&nbsp;the year about to commence. Moses was instructed about&nbsp;such a concept already when told to make two trumpets for&nbsp;himself in Numbers 10,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אך בעשור לחודש</span><span class="font5">, “however on the tenth of that&nbsp;month, etc.” whenever the Torah uses the word: אך, it is&nbsp;meant to exclude something. All of the other festivals have&nbsp;been called: מקראי קודש, “holy convocations;” this implies that&nbsp;on these days we would celebrate also by eating more and&nbsp;better food, drink some wine, etc.; and generally enjoy&nbsp;pleasurable experiences. This day has been called מקרא&nbsp;קודש, the last letter being missing. The Day of Atonement is&nbsp;an exception to all this. Instead of a day of enjoyment, we are&nbsp;to deliberately cause ourselves discomfort, i.e. ועניתם את&nbsp;נפשותיכם.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prior to the giving of the first set of Tablets which Moses had smashed, the Torah had written that the elite of&nbsp;the people when accompanying Moses before he ascended&nbsp;the Mountain to receive them, had “seen” G’d, had eaten and&nbsp;drunk,” (Exodus 24,11). It was stated there that G’d had not&nbsp;punished them for this on </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font5"> occasion, a clear indication&nbsp;that they had deserved to be punished. As a consequence,&nbsp;when they made a golden calf and treated it as a deity and&nbsp;danced around it and ate and drank, the result was that at&nbsp;least some ended up treating that calf as a deity by&nbsp;prostrating themselves in front of it. (Exodus 32,6) As part of&nbsp;the atonement, a process completed on the 10<sup>th</sup> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">when Moses brought them the second set of Tablets, eating&nbsp;and drinking was absolutely prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכל מלאכה לא תעשו, </span><span class="font5">“and you must not perform&nbsp;any manner of constructive work on that day.” This day is&nbsp;equal to an ordinary Sabbath, when all manner of&nbsp;constructive work is also prohibited. Careful examination of&nbsp;the text will show that on all other festivals the work&nbsp;prohibition is termed מלאכת עבודה, i.e. the kind of work&nbsp;reflecting our dependence on physical, demeaning labour, in&nbsp;order to earn our livelihood. On those days we are allowed to&nbsp;perform most of the kind of work necessary to prepare our&nbsp;food. (verse 7 here and Exodus 12,16). The penalty for&nbsp;violating the work prohibition on the Day of Atonement is&nbsp;spelled out in verse 30, והאבדתי את הנפש ההיא מקרב עמה, “I will&nbsp;destroy that soul from membership among its people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,29. כי כל הנפש אשר לא תעונה</span><span class="font5">, “for every person (soul) that does not afflict itself;” we have heard the warning&nbsp;previously; now we hear the penalty for disobedience, what&nbsp;is it? ונכרתה, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">it will be cut off from the future of its people.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל מלאכה לא תעשו</span><span class="font5">, “you must not perform any&nbsp;activity defined as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">m’lachah;</span><span class="font5"> the Torah has repeated this on&nbsp;account of what follows, i.e. חוקת עולם לדורותיכם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“a&nbsp;permanent statute throughout your generations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שבת שבתון הוא</span><span class="font5">, “it is written (spelled) as is and&nbsp;read as is, as I explained on Leviticus 16,31. [The word שבת&nbsp;is generally in the feminine mode and we would have&nbsp;expected the pronoun referring to it as being spelled in&nbsp;accordance with that, i.e. היא. Compare how it is treated in&nbsp;the commentaries and in the Talmud. Ed.] ועניתם את נפשותיכם&nbsp;התשעה לחדש בערב, “you are to afflict yourselves on the ninth of&nbsp;the month in the evening;” our sages query how it is that we&nbsp;have to afflict ourselves on the day </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the Day of&nbsp;Atonement, when the date set by the Torah for that day it the&nbsp;tenth? They conclude that what is meant here is that by&nbsp;eating and drinking on the day prior to the Day of Atonement&nbsp;we can fulfill the “festive” aspect of that day, which is after all&nbsp;part of the list of festivals. (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashana,</span><span class="font5"> folio 9)&nbsp;they go as far as to state that treating the ninth day of that&nbsp;month as a festival, is equivalent having afflicted oneself with&nbsp;total abstention from food and drink on the tent of that month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, when the Torah demands of us to eat </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzot</span><span class="font5"> in the evening of the 14<sup>th</sup>-15<sup>th</sup> of Nissan, Exodus&nbsp;12,18) we cannot interpret that line in a similar manner, as in&nbsp;our verse the eating of food on the ninth day is linked to&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">afflicting oneself, something that is not so in connection with&nbsp;Passover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בתשעה לחדש בערב, it is clear from the cantillation marks, i.e. the strongly dividing mark </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">etnachta</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> on the previous word:&nbsp;לנפשותיכם, makes it clear that the word בתשעה introduces a&nbsp;new subject, nothing to do with the words ועניתם את נפשותיכם.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It clearly refers to the evening following part of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">shabbat</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> which lasts until the evening following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מערב עד ערב, “from this verse we have proof that the day follows the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תשבתו, “you will observe spiritual rest; the entire period is part of the Day of Atonement, which is a festival so that&nbsp;you have to add a little time extra at its beginning and at its&nbsp;official ending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבתכם, “</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Sabbaths.” This day has been given to the people of Israel as a Sabbath and as a holy convocation. It&nbsp;says: 'שבת לה, “as a Sabbath for the Lord,” and it also said: “a&nbsp;special Sabbath for you.” The former is the Sabbath on which&nbsp;G’d had rested from the creation. The יום השביעי part of the&nbsp;Sabbath is never referred to as being Israel’s, it is always the&nbsp;Lord’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,36. עצרת היא, “it is a day of special assembly;” this is&nbsp;a parable describing a king whose children came to visit him&nbsp;for the first time; at that time the king said to them: “when are&nbsp;you going to visit me again?” they said to him: “in about a&nbsp;couple of months. ”Thereupon the king took his leave of&nbsp;them. When the children came again to see their father the&nbsp;king, he asked again when they would come to see him&nbsp;again. When they said that they would come again in about&nbsp;four months, the king again thanked them for their visit and&nbsp;bid them farewell. When this story repeated itself a third time&nbsp;and on that occasion the children told him that they would not&nbsp;visit him again until after about seven months, the king&nbsp;begged them to delay their departure for at least one&nbsp;additional day. They agreed and did so. He gave them a&nbsp;special blessing for having spent the extra time with him.&nbsp;This parable is supposed to explain why there is no day&nbsp;called עצרת after Passover and after </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> but only after&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> seeing that it is over six months until the next&nbsp;Passover. The reason there is no pilgrimage festival during&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the winter is to save the people having to travel to Jerusalem&nbsp;during the inclement winter months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,37. אלה מועדי</span><span class="font5">, “these are the appointed seasons,&nbsp;etc,” the reason why the Torah had to repeat this once more&nbsp;is because we do not find the verse והקרבתם אשה, “you are to&nbsp;present a fire offering” in connection with the offerings on the&nbsp;festival of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot,</span><span class="font5"> (called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Atzeret</span><span class="font5"> by the Torah). This verse&nbsp;is a reminder that it applies to all the festivals. The Torah had&nbsp;also not used that expression in connection with the&nbsp;Sabbath, at the beginning of the chapter dealing with the&nbsp;festivals. This is why in verse 38 it specifically exempts the&nbsp;Sabbath from this commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">להקריב אשה לה' עולה ומנחה זבח ונסכים</span><span class="font5">, “to bring an offering made by fire unto the Lord; a burnt offering and a mealoffering a sacrifice and libations ;” on all the מועדים, these&nbsp;four categories of offerings are to be presented; the&nbsp;expression זבח applies to meat offerings parts of which are to&nbsp;be consumed by the priests, who are allowed to eat parts of&nbsp;the communal sin offerings offered on these festivals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,39. אך בחמשה עשר יום</span><span class="font5">, “but on the fifteenth day, etc.” the word אך, as usual, is meant to exclude something;” in this&nbsp;instance it refers to the fact that the Passover which must be&nbsp;eaten on the night of the 14<sup>th</sup> to the fifteenth of Nissan does&nbsp;not require the owners of these animals to spend an&nbsp;additional night in Jerusalem, seeing that the whole offering&nbsp;had already been consumed. The reason for this relaxation&nbsp;of the Torah’s standards is that the farmers are preoccupied&nbsp;with harvesting the barley in their fields at that time. The&nbsp;same is true on the festival of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot.</span><span class="font5"> which occurs during&nbsp;the period of the wheat harvest. However on the fifteenth day&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey,</span><span class="font5"> when all the harvests of the fields had already&nbsp;been brought into the barns, the pilgrims are required to&nbsp;rejoice for eight days in Jerusalem. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום הראשון</span><span class="font5">, “on the first day, etc.; ”how can this day be described as the ‘first’ day seeing it is the fifteenth of the&nbsp;month? According to a well known </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash,</span><span class="font5"> this is a hint that&nbsp;the count of our sins committed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">after </span><span class="font5">the Day of Atonement&nbsp;on the tenth of the month, had been suspended until that&nbsp;day. Seeing that most people had been preoccupied with&nbsp;preparing for the festival of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font5"> during these four days, if&nbsp;inadvertent sins had been committed, they are “overlooked”&nbsp;on those days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,40. פרי עץ הדר</span><span class="font5">, “both from the type of trees that produce fruit and from those which are pleasant to look at&nbsp;and which provide pleasant fragrance.” They are all to be tied&nbsp;together into one bunch. The moral lesson of this instruction&nbsp;is that both the pious people and those less pious but&nbsp;generally observant, are to join in carrying out G’d’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמחתם שבעת ימים, </span><span class="font5">“you are to rejoice for seven consecutive days.” The reason for this is that each day is to&nbsp;be considered as a festival in its own right. The fact that the&nbsp;number of sacrifices offered during these days vary, is proof&nbsp;of this, compared with the offerings on the seven days of&nbsp;Passover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,42. בסוכות תשבו שבעות ימים</span><span class="font5">, “you are to dwell in huts for seven days.” This is to remind us that in the desert our&nbsp;forefathers relied on the clouds of G’d’s glory to protect them&nbsp;against nature and its inclemency, instead of relying on a&nbsp;man made roof. (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkah</span><span class="font5"> folio 11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל האזרח בישראל ישבו בסוכות</span><span class="font5">, “all home-born Israelites are to dwell in such huts.” The Torah did not need to remind the&nbsp;convert to do so as that was the only “home” he knew, not&nbsp;having one to move out of. Home-born Israelites, however,&nbsp;who owned not only one house, but palaces and summer&nbsp;and winter homes, are commanded to vacate those during&nbsp;seven days of this festival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In light of the fact that the season of this festival was to be immediately after ingathering of all the harvests had been&nbsp;completed, the farmers were reminded by this symbolic act&nbsp;not to feel secure that no harm could befall them during the&nbsp;six months until Passover, i.e. that they had to rely on the&nbsp;Lord’s goodwill on a daily basis. By complying with the&nbsp;instructions to move out of their homes for seven days, these&nbsp;Israelites demonstrated their faith in the Lord, and their&nbsp;loyalty to His Torah. There is no more practical gesture that&nbsp;they could make of the fact that they did not take credit for&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">their</span><span class="font5"> successful farming methods, but gave credit to the&nbsp;Lord’s benevolent supervision of nature for their benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקחו אליך שמן זית</span><span class="font5">, “that they will bring you olive oil;”&nbsp;the reason that this verse, i.e. the instructions it contains,&nbsp;was repeated is that in this Book of the five Books of Moses,&nbsp;the one containing most of the instructions connected with&nbsp;the service of the priests in the Temple, was that the time&nbsp;had come to list in the appropriate order the rules&nbsp;surrounding the function of the Lampstand, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menorah,</span><span class="font5"> and&nbsp;the Table, which are interdependent on one another. The&nbsp;incense had already been dealt with at length in Leviticus&nbsp;chapter 17,12-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By rights we could have expected to read about the presentation of the show-breads before reading about the&nbsp;function of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menorah</span><span class="font5"> which was not a sacrificial act, and&nbsp;was subservient to the presentation of the show breads as&nbsp;had been made plain by the words: ואת המנורה נוכח השלחן,&nbsp;“and the Lampstand opposite the Table,” (Exodus 26,35).The&nbsp;reason that the Torah did not write matters in that order was&nbsp;that it wanted to write the report about the blasphemer next&nbsp;to the portion of the showbreads, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has explained.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> quoted a sage as saying that the blasphemer had&nbsp;made fun of the showbreads ridiculing a law that offered the&nbsp;Lord bread that was on occasion a whole week old, as these&nbsp;breads were only exchanged for new ones every Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">להעלות נר תמיד</span><span class="font5">, “to kindle a lamp to burn continually;” it was kept burning also on the Sabbath, and even if it had&nbsp;become ritually contaminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.3</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מחוץ לפרוכת העדות באהל מועד</span><span class="font5">, “outside of the curtain&nbsp;of testimony of the tent of Meeting.” The wording is to teach&nbsp;that the position of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menorah</span><span class="font5"> inside the Sanctuary was&nbsp;relatively closer to the dividing curtain than to the entrance of&nbsp;the Sanctuary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יערוך אותו</span><span class="font5">, “he is to arrange it.” (the olive oil)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על המנורה הטהורה</span><span class="font5">, “upon the pure </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menorah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash,i</span><span class="font5"> as he understood the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra,</span><span class="font5"> seeing that&nbsp;the priest kindling the lamps on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menorah</span><span class="font5"> did so without&nbsp;using tools such as matches, etc., it was important to make&nbsp;certain that no material was used that could potentially confer&nbsp;ritual impurity on the lampstand which was made of metal&nbsp;and therefore liable to such contamination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לפני ה</span><span class="font5">׳, “before the Lord;” the fire was not to be lit </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">outside</span><span class="font5"> the Sanctuary and then to be transferred to the wicks&nbsp;in the oil on the lampstand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שתים עשרה חלות</span><span class="font5">, “twelve loaves,” corresponding to the number of the tribes. (Ibn Ezra) They are the loaves known&nbsp;as “showbreads.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;החלה האחת</span><span class="font5">, “the one loaf;” the kneading, making&nbsp;the dough, etc., should be a single operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמת אותם</span><span class="font5">, “you shall place them;” the sudden switch to the plural mode, אותם, ”them,” means that when it came to&nbsp;baking, 2 loaves each were put in the oven at one time.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמת אותם</span><span class="font5">, there were three sets of moulds; one&nbsp;to shape them when they were dough; one while the dough&nbsp;was in the oven; and the third when they were finished&nbsp;baking to arrange them in such a manner that they would not&nbsp;deteriorate between one Sabbath and the next. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שתים מערכות</span><span class="font5">, “two rows;” one at each end of the Table;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שש מערכות על השלחן הטהור</span><span class="font5">, “six rows upon the pure Table;” six loaves would be placed one above the other on&nbsp;either side of the Table the sides of the loaves would face the&nbsp;side of the Table, as I have explained in Exodus 25,29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתת על המערכת</span><span class="font5">, “you are to place next to each&nbsp;row, which were one handbreadth apart, frankincense.” The&nbsp;word על here is to be understood as in Number 2,20 עליו&nbsp;where it mans “next to” (the next tribe).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על המערכת</span><span class="font5">, “frankincense would be placed on the surface of the table next to each row.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[The reader will find an illustration at the end of the last volume. Ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיתה ללחם אזכרתה</span><span class="font5">, ”so that the frankincense may serve the loaves as a symbol of it.” Rabbi Shimon states that the&nbsp;expression אזכרה here, as well as in Leviticus 2,2, refers to&nbsp;the partial fistful used. In other words, two partial fistfuls of&nbsp;frankincense were required, one for each row of six&nbsp;showbreads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,8. ביום השבת, ביום השבת</span><span class="font5">, “Every Sabbath day;” while new breads were replacing last week’s breads, the&nbsp;frankincense of last week’s breads was burned up at the end&nbsp;of the week on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יערכנו</span><span class="font5">, “he shall arrange it;” the subject is the showbreads, not the branches described in Exodus 25,32.&nbsp;The latter were not arranged on the Sabbath but on the&nbsp;Sabbath eve. All the furnishings in the Tabernacle were&nbsp;arranged so that their length was parallel to the long walls of&nbsp;the structure, with the exception of the Holy Ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,10. ויצא בן אשה ישראלית</span><span class="font5">, “the son of an Israelite woman went out, (became involved in a serious argument)&nbsp;the word יצא is used in this sense also in Numbers 16,27:&nbsp;יצאו נצבים, “they went out in a challenging posture;” as well as&nbsp;in Proverbs 25,8: אל תצא לריב מהר, “do not be in a hurry to&nbsp;start a quarrel; this is the plain meaning of the line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on this line comments that this man whose father was an Egyptian, went to pitch his tent among the tents of&nbsp;the tribe of Dan, his mother’s tribe, as stated by the Torah.&nbsp;The Danites rejected him as tribal allegiance is based on the&nbsp;father and not on the mother. When he came to Moses&nbsp;complaining, the court upheld the opinion of the Danites. As&nbsp;a result of being frustrated, he cursed the G’d Who had so&nbsp;discriminated against him. The Torah had ruled that the&nbsp;tribes should each take up positions in camp in the vicinity of&nbsp;their respective tribal flags. Numbers 2,2. This man then&nbsp;ridiculed a religion which sees fit to offer its G’d bread that&nbsp;had been baked as long ago as a whole week ago, instead of&nbsp;presenting Him daily with fresh bread. This had come to his&nbsp;attention on a Sabbath. According to tradition, the incident&nbsp;with the blasphemer and that with the person who had&nbsp;collected kindling on the Sabbath occurred about the same&nbsp;time. This seems difficult to accept as the incident with the&nbsp;person collecting firewood on the Sabbath occurred in the&nbsp;first year of the Israelites’ wandering. Any incident involving&nbsp;tribal allegiance could not have happened until the second&nbsp;year when the order in which the Israelites took up their&nbsp;positions relative to the Tabernacle in their midst was&nbsp;established during the second month of the second year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוא בן איש מצרי</span><span class="font5">, “and he was the son of an Egyptian man.” Even though at that time he was not yet a bastard as&nbsp;that law had not yet been publicized, he was adjudged as&nbsp;guilty of blasphemy by the court as if he were a bastard. [He&nbsp;would be guilty of violating one of the seven Noachide&nbsp;Commandments that apply universally, bastard or no&nbsp;bastard. (law #2) Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בתוך בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> who quotes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat Kohanim,</span><span class="font5"> these words mean that he had converted to&nbsp;Judaism. [Why he should, seeing that his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mother</span><span class="font5"> was&nbsp;Jewish, I fail to understand. Ed.] If you were to ask that we&nbsp;read in Exodus, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explained on the words: וירא כי אין איש,&nbsp;that Moses had made sure that no one had seen him killing&nbsp;the Egyptian (Exodus 2,12), that these words mean that&nbsp;Moses foresaw in a prophetic vision that no potential&nbsp;descendant of that Egyptian would ever convert to Judaism,&nbsp;we would have to assume that at that moment this man’s&nbsp;mother was already pregnant with him. What Moses had&nbsp;seen prophetically was that in the future no one would ever&nbsp;descend from this man who had the potential to convert to&nbsp;Judaism. Hence by killing him, he had not committed any&nbsp;ethical crime, especially seeing that the man had murdered a&nbsp;Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, there is nothing in our scriptures that asks us to look for extenuating circumstances before executing a&nbsp;blasphemer. At this point, our author raises the question&nbsp;about the relevancy of conversion, seeing that any child born&nbsp;by a Jewish mother, be the father a slave or a pagan, is&nbsp;automatically Jewish from birth. The only answer to this&nbsp;question could be that this automatic Judaism came into&nbsp;force only after the Torah had been given at Mount Sinai.&nbsp;Seeing that this man had been sired at least about 60 years&nbsp;prior to the giving of the Torah, he had not qualified as a Jew&nbsp;automatically, but of course could have converted at any&nbsp;time. [Remember he had been sired before Moses even&nbsp;escaped to Midian. Ed.] Due to these considerations this&nbsp;blasphemer had been a convert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different approach to the scenario involved here: the plain meaning of the words: בתוך בני ישראל, the blasphemer&nbsp;had been an Egyptian, due to his father having been an&nbsp;Egyptian; going back to the times when the Israelites had still&nbsp;been enslaved. After the Exodus, he converted and therefore&nbsp;ever since he was viewed as a Jew due to his mother having&nbsp;been a Jewess. He felt that seeing he had no father who also&nbsp;having been a Jew belonged to one of the tribes, he was&nbsp;entitled to belong at least to his mother’s tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,11. ויקוב בן האשה הישראלית ויקלל</span><span class="font5">, “the son of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed;” as a result of the quarrel he began to curse;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקוב, ויקלל</span><span class="font5">, the Torah does not use the expression ויברך which is traditionally used someone who curses the name of&nbsp;G’d, as for instance in Kings I 21,13, where Navot had been&nbsp;accused (falsely) of cursing the King and G’d, in order for the&nbsp;King to have a pretext to have him executed for not selling&nbsp;him his vineyard. It uses the word: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקלל, </span><span class="font5">instead, which refers&nbsp;to someone cursing without using the tetragram as the Lord’s&nbsp;name, a sin not punishable by the death penalty. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את השם ויקלל</span><span class="font5">, he also used the tetragram when cursing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Yossi is on record as saying that the Egyptians who were ritually contaminated, also conferred their ritual&nbsp;contamination on the Israelites. His colleagues claimed that&nbsp;the wife of Neriah, a grandson of Dan, was Shlomit, daughter&nbsp;of Divri, and that during the night following the day when&nbsp;Moses slew the Egyptian who was one of the supervisors&nbsp;checking the number of bricks delivered by the Jewish&nbsp;slaves, raped her. History has a way of repeating itself.&nbsp;According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma, Emor</span><span class="font5"> 24 as well as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vayikra Rabbah&nbsp;32,4</span><span class="font5"> when the quarrel broke out, and a Jewish man accused&nbsp;this man to be a bastard, this man asked the accuser where&nbsp;his father had been on the night when he claimed that his&nbsp;mother had been raped. The night he referred to was the&nbsp;night when his mother had supposedly been raped by an&nbsp;Egyptian overseer, who had used a pretext to send her&nbsp;husband on an errant. The reason why this blasphemer used&nbsp;the tetragram when cursing G’d, was that he had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">overheard&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">how Moses had used that name as a means to kill his father.&nbsp;[I do not follow this, because if he had not been born yet, and&nbsp;his mother became pregnant with him as a result of the rape,&nbsp;how could he have overheard Moses? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[This is why the Torah in Exodus 2,14 has one of the two quarrelling Israelites ask Moses whether he planned to&nbsp;kill him also by using the tetragram to curse him, so that he&nbsp;would fall dead. (הלהרגני אתה אומר: “are you going to utter a&nbsp;word which will kill me?”)]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למטה דן</span><span class="font5">, “from the tribe of Dan.” He had been the one </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">causing</span><span class="font5"> the quarrel. He had justified his action by saying that&nbsp;he would now rectify an injustice done to him. This may also&nbsp;have been hinted at when in Genesis 49,16, according to the&nbsp;Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> folio </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">4,</span><span class="font5"> Yaakov on his deathbed, using&nbsp;prophetic vision had said דן ידין עמו, “Dan will judge his&nbsp;people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,12. ויניחהו במשמר</span><span class="font5">, “they placed him in custody;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> they did not place the man who had&nbsp;collected kindling on the Sabbath in the same cell with him,&nbsp;although both incidents occurred at about the same time. If&nbsp;you were to ask that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> had interpreted the word ויצא, “he&nbsp;went out,” in Leviticus 24,10 by quoting Rabbi Levi who said&nbsp;that “he left his world,” whereas Rabbi Berechyah is quoted&nbsp;as saying that the word means that this blasphemer first&nbsp;ridiculed the legislation about the showbreads (as we already&nbsp;explained), something that could not have occurred until the&nbsp;second year when the Tabernacle was functioning, whereas&nbsp;the person collecting the kindling had done so on the second&nbsp;Sabbath, i.e. at Marah, or at the latest immediately after the&nbsp;giving of the Torah only 49 days after the Exodus in the first&nbsp;year, even before the Torah had given, so how could they&nbsp;possibly have been placed in the same cell as that person&nbsp;had long since been executed? (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi on Parshat&nbsp;S’hlach lecha)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are therefore forced to answer that the tribes had taken up positions in the desert in accordance with the&nbsp;sequence in which Yaakov had blessed them, already before&nbsp;there had been any mention of the erecting of a Tabernacle,&nbsp;so that the incident with the blasphemer could have occurred&nbsp;much earlier than the impression given in our portion. We&nbsp;have explained repeatedly that the author of the Torah did&nbsp;not feel restrained to report events in their chronological&nbsp;sequence. The blasphemer ridiculed the legislation of the&nbsp;showbreads as soon as it was taught, though the Tabernacle&nbsp;had not even been built yet. [he was not driven to do so&nbsp;because he had been refused to put up his tent with the&nbsp;Danites. Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'לפרוש להם על פי ה, </span><span class="font5">”in order to receive instructions from the Lord how to proceed.” They assumed that the sinner had&nbsp;to be stoned to death as is evident from Leviticus 20,9. If&nbsp;stoning is the penalty for cursing one’s parents, how could&nbsp;the penalty for cursing the Lord be more lenient? We have a&nbsp;rule that penalties cannot be based merely on our judgment,&nbsp;i.e. our logic, but must have been ordained from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וסמכו</span><span class="font5">, “and all who heard the curse are to place&nbsp;their hands, etc.;” what was the reason for this procedure&nbsp;which had to be performed on the bodies of all people about&nbsp;to be executed legally? The reason is that when judgment&nbsp;was passed, the witnesses on whose testimony this&nbsp;sentence was based had been forced during the proceedings&nbsp;to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">literally</span><span class="font5"> quote the words used by the blasphemer in doing&nbsp;so. This had made them perform this symbolic act by means&nbsp;of which they transferred any guilt that they had been&nbsp;burdened with through that to the blasphemer before the&nbsp;latter was executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל השומעים</span><span class="font5">, “all who had heard it;” seeing that he would be executed by stoning due to their testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורגמו אותו, </span><span class="font5">“and they (all) have to stone him.” This was because that person had converted to Judaism. If he had not&nbsp;converted, he would still have been guilty of the death&nbsp;penalty, but, like all gentiles, he would have been executed&nbsp;by the sword, following the appropriate warning of what he&nbsp;was risking by committing that sin, and, of course by eye&nbsp;witnesses testifying against him. We have now heard of the&nbsp;penalty for blaspheming, but where did we read about the&nbsp;warning not to commit this sin, especially that it applies also&nbsp;to gentiles? It is found in Genesis 2,16-17, according to the&nbsp;Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 56, combined with Exodus 22,27,&nbsp;“you must not curse G’d.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אותו </span><span class="font5">“him,” but not his clothing. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי יקלל אלוקיו ונשא חטאו</span><span class="font5">, “whosoever curses his&nbsp;G’d, shall bear the burden of his sin.” When reading this&nbsp;verse superficially, we gain the impression that the guilty&nbsp;person must simply live with the burden of his sin, i.e. that&nbsp;the matter is between him and his G’d, and that the human&nbsp;tribunal on earth is not charged with carrying out the penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After all, how did the court know which of his deities that gentile had had in mind? Not only that, but in the Torah even&nbsp;judges are also described simply as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">‘elohim!’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'כגר כאזרח וגו</span><span class="font5">, “both convert and natural born Jew,&nbsp;etc;” we might have expected the Torah to mention the&nbsp;natural born Jew first; but the Torah wanted to teach us that&nbsp;the convert who had been born as a pagan, and had had to&nbsp;overcome many obstacles to convert, is given additional&nbsp;credit for having made this effort by being named here before&nbsp;natural born Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.17. ואיש כי יכה כל נפש אדם</span><span class="font5">, “and any person who strikes another human fatally (deliberately), etc.” since the&nbsp;Torah had just dealt with people who started quarrels,&nbsp;something that may have fatal results, it reminds us once&nbsp;more of the seriousness of starting quarrels, the results of&nbsp;which are beyond one’s original intention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,20. כן ינתן בו</span><span class="font5">, “so shall be done to him;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on this verse comments that the text is not to be understood literally,&nbsp;but what is meant is that financial compensation must be&nbsp;paid to the victim. This is perfectly logical, as in many&nbsp;instances it would be impossible to carry out the literal&nbsp;meaning of the text, and it would even be totally unfair, for&nbsp;instance, for a one eyed person to have to lose one eye if he&nbsp;had gouged out the eye of a person who had two good eyes&nbsp;with which to see. Our sages’ interpretation of this verse is&nbsp;therefore clearly the correct one. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the aggrieved party should take issue with this by arguing that he is not to blame that the person who had&nbsp;gouged out one of his eyes had only had a single eye, and&nbsp;that he insists on the literal application of this verse, he is told&nbsp;that the Torah was written in order to address normal&nbsp;situations, not exceptional situations, for if it had intended to&nbsp;provide in its text for every imaginable contingency, the&nbsp;Torah would be far too long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover, even assuming after the exceptions the Torah sometimes made for a person’s financial&nbsp;circumstances, this would not necessarily be fair, as who&nbsp;knows whether a person who is poor today may not become&nbsp;rich next week or vice versa? The overriding consideration&nbsp;for compensation if a life had been taken deliberately is&nbsp;spelled out by the Torah when it wrote that financial&nbsp;compensation for taking a life is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">absolutely</span><span class="font5"> inadmissible, as&nbsp;who can determine the value of a person’s life in terms of&nbsp;money? (Numbers 35,31) Individual limbs, however, are&nbsp;subject to the judges’ evaluation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומכה בהמה ישלמנה</span><span class="font5">, “someone who had&nbsp;deliberately struck his fellow man’s animal must pay&nbsp;compensation.” The Torah has repeated this legislation, as&nbsp;originally it had used the expression: נפש, “life-force,”&nbsp;implying that the attacker had aimed at a part of the body&nbsp;that is most vulnerable, whereas here it did not restrict itself&nbsp;to when an especially vulnerable part of the animal had been&nbsp;struck. Compensation is payable even if the animal had not&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">died</span><span class="font5"> as the result of being struck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כגר כאזרח</span><span class="font5">, “be it a convert or a natural born&nbsp;Israelite;” just as the Torah is concerned with the wellbeing of&nbsp;a natural born Jew, it is concerned with the wellbeing of a&nbsp;person who-has converted to Judaism or to his animal.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וירגמו אותו אבן</span><span class="font5">, “they stoned him to death with stones.” The use of the word אבן “stone,” in the singular mode,&nbsp;teaches that if one stone had been enough to kill the sinner,&nbsp;no more stones are to be hurled at him. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובני ישראל עשו</span><span class="font5">, “and the Children of Israel had done;” from this day onwards the legislation of how to deal with&nbsp;people who injure others was practiced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of this line: the words: “they did,” refer not only to the last verse preceding this, but state&nbsp;that all the steps of the legal proceedings of carrying out an&nbsp;execution were performed dutifully by all the people&nbsp;whenever the need arose to do </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">so.(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat B’har</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.1.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ב</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הר סיני</span><span class="font5">, “at Mount Sinai.” Whenever the&nbsp;expression: “at Mount Sinai,” is used in the Torah, it refers to&nbsp;a point in time </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> Moses descended after his third&nbsp;lengthy stay on it in the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey.</span><span class="font5"> In other words, the&nbsp;legislation described here had been revealed to Moses&nbsp;before the Tabernacle had been built. If these laws were&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">recorded</span><span class="font5"> in the Book of Leviticus, and not in the Book of&nbsp;Exodus, seeing that Moses had descended the third time&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> events described at the end of the Book of Exodus,&nbsp;this is because the laws applied only after the Israelites had&nbsp;settled in their homeland, especially the laws governing&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yovel,</span><span class="font5"> that are prominent in this portion; they&nbsp;are all laws applying also to the priests (although they were&nbsp;not real landowners) about whom most of the legislation in&nbsp;the Book of Leviticus revolves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When we consider that numerous laws were recorded in the second third and fourth Book of the Torah and&nbsp;repeated in the fifth Book by Moses, it is clear that laws that&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">were not</span><span class="font5"> repeated by Moses in the fifth Book, must have&nbsp;been given to him already at Mount Sinai. The laws&nbsp;concerning the Sabbaths of the land in the seventh year, and&nbsp;the Sabbath of the land, and the freedom to be granted to the&nbsp;slaves, and the restoration of lands that had been sold under&nbsp;financial duress by their owner during a particular 50 year&nbsp;cycle known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel,</span><span class="font5"> belong to such categories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The laws about inheritance of the land and those that could be applied only after the Israelites had taken&nbsp;possession of the lands on the east Bank of the Jordan as&nbsp;well as a number of laws pertaining to land ownership were&nbsp;repeated once more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It appears therefore that if the Torah had to make a point here to emphasize that the laws had been given to&nbsp;Moses at Mount Sinai, we must assume that the general&nbsp;outline was given at Sinai to the people and the details were&nbsp;not revealed to them until realization of keeping them would&nbsp;draw near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תבואו</span><span class="font5">, “when you will come;” what follows will be&nbsp;applied after the land has been conquered, and distributed to&nbsp;the tribes who have settled there. If this were not so, what&nbsp;would be the meaning of such words as: “your vineyards,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> fields,” unless the ownership of these fields and&nbsp;vineyards had already been established and each one of the&nbsp;people addressed knew the boundaries of their land?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושבתה הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “the land is to observe a rest, ‘Sabbatical;’” seeing that we might understand this term as referring only to&nbsp;a prohibition not to dig in the land for treasure, not to dig&nbsp;irrigation canals, etc., the Torah spells out that we must not&nbsp;plough, put seed in the ground, nor dig for wells, either.&nbsp;Neither must we perform work for the betterment of orchards&nbsp;or vineyards, which do not need to be ploughed every year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'שבת לה</span><span class="font5">, “a Sabbath for the Lord;” the legislation is not because the land is tired after producing crops six years in a&nbsp;row, but the Sabbath of the land is to remind you that the&nbsp;land </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">belongs</span><span class="font5"> to Me, though you are its tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'שבת לה</span><span class="font5">; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands these words as meaning: “a Sabbath in honour of My name;” what he means is that you&nbsp;are not to understand this law as designed to teach you how&nbsp;to farm efficiently by giving the land a breather every seven&nbsp;years, but you are to demonstrate that you observe the&nbsp;Lord’s commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,3. 'שש שנים וגו</span><span class="font5">, for six consecutive years you are to&nbsp;sow, etc;” this verse proves once again that the Torah is not&nbsp;bound to relate matters in a chronological order, else it would&nbsp;have written this verse </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the verse about abstaining&nbsp;from agricultural activity during the seventh year. Actually,&nbsp;this paragraph has already appeared in Exodus 23,10, in the&nbsp;chronological order that we would expect. It is only being&nbsp;repeated here on account of the addition of the olive groves&nbsp;that were omitted here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,5. *ואת ענבי נזזירן</span><span class="font5">, “and the grapes of your undressed vine;” these are grapes which grew without any physical&nbsp;input by you. They correspond to what the Torah called ספיח&nbsp;קצירך, grain growing by itself during the seventh year of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> cycle when you did not sow any seeds. Proof that&nbsp;this interpretation is correct, can be found in verse 11 in our&nbsp;chapter where ססיחיה and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נזיריה, </span><span class="font5">are mentioned side by side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Onkelos also understands לא תבצרו את נזיריה, as a prohibition to pluck those grapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבת שבתון יהיה לארץ</span><span class="font5">, “it shall be a year of solemn (complete) rest for the land.” The reason for this is that the&nbsp;land is not in your possession during that year.” (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,6. והיתה שבת הארץ לכם לאכלה</span><span class="font5">, “what the earth produces during that year is for aj] of you to serve as food.”&nbsp;You are not obligated to tithe any part of it, nor to set it aside&nbsp;for the poor, as it is not yours to distribute. Neither is what it&nbsp;produces to be converted into libations to be offered in the&nbsp;Temple. (Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">25.8.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וספרת לך שבע שבתות שנים</span><span class="font5">, ”you are to count for&nbsp;yourself 7 seven-year cycles, seven times;” seeing that the&nbsp;Torah speaks of counting in the singular mode, i.e. by a&nbsp;single person, it addresses the High Court which will&nbsp;proclaim the start of the Jubilee year. There is no need to&nbsp;recite a benediction as is the case in Leviticus 23,15 when&nbsp;counting the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer;</span><span class="font5"> there two separate counts had been&nbsp;mentioned, days and weeks. This had been repeated also in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 16,9. One was meant for the individuals and&nbsp;one for the High Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.9. תעבירו שופר בכל ארצכם</span><span class="font5">, “sound the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shofar </span><span class="font5">throughout your land,” at all major highway junctions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.10. שנת החמישים שנה וקראתם דרור</span><span class="font5">, “the fiftieth year, when you will proclaim freedom.” We find something similar&nbsp;with the Levites who retired from active service at the age of&nbsp;fifty, and they could not perform physical service anymore.&nbsp;(Numbers 8,25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכל יושביה</span><span class="font5">, “for all its inhabitants;” seeing that the Torah wrote: ושבתם איש אל אחוזתו, “each man of you is to return to&nbsp;his ancestral heritage,” it would have sounded as if women&nbsp;did not possess ancestral land in Israel. Therefore the Torah&nbsp;also had to write: לכל יושביה, to all of its inhabitants no matter&nbsp;which sex. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra,</span><span class="font5"> this meaning has been derived&nbsp;from the word: תשובו, [which is a repetition. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכל יושביה</span><span class="font5">, “for all its inhabitants.” This is why as soon as even when only parts of the tribes had been exiled, this law&nbsp;could no longer be observed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יובל היא</span><span class="font5">, “it is a Jubilee year,” the expression יובל&nbsp;from the root יבל “to bring home,” reflects the extraordinary&nbsp;function of this year, namely to release slaves and to enable&nbsp;them to return to their original homes. Compare the use of&nbsp;this root in the transitive mode in Isaiah 23,7: יובילוה רגליה,&nbsp;“her own feet shall carry her far off”, or Psalms 60,11: מי&nbsp;יובילני עיר מצור?, ”would that I be brought to the fortified city!”&nbsp;Compare also Isaiah 18,7: ביום ההוא יובל שי, “on that day a gift&nbsp;will be brought from a people far removed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[What follows really belongs to verse 10, the author may have had his reasons why he decided to place this here.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכם, </span><span class="font5">“for to you Israel</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">exclusively</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.” (</span><span class="font5">Ibn Ezra).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יובל היא שנת החמישים שנה</span><span class="font5">, “it, i.e. the fiftieth year is a Jubilee;” on the face of it the meaning of this line is not clear,&nbsp;nor why it is needed, seeing that the Torah had written the&nbsp;same words already in verse 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We therefore need to understand this as follows: seeing that the Torah had written in verse 10 that we are to sanctify&nbsp;this year, that the meaning was that we should do so from&nbsp;the beginning of the year already, and that at the end of that&nbsp;year its special sanctity would continue for ten days until the&nbsp;Day of Atonement, as it is a custom to always add to, and&nbsp;thereby include, something secular, so that it also becomes&nbsp;something holy, the Torah, by repeating this line, teaches&nbsp;that the sanctity of that year does not extend beyond the end&nbsp;of its calendar year, i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh hashanah.</span><span class="font5"> (Talmud, tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah</span><span class="font5"> folio </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">25.12.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מן השדה תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “you will eat from whatever the&nbsp;field yields on its own.” Nothing had been planted during that&nbsp;year, of course. The Torah promises that there will&nbsp;nonetheless be a harvest. However, we are not to bring that&nbsp;“harvest’’ home to our barns for storage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,14, וכי תמכרו </span><span class="font5">ממכר, “and if you sell something to your&nbsp;neighbour, etc.” this includes the selling of chattels. How do&nbsp;we know that the law concerning overcharging does not&nbsp;apply to real estate transactions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah continues with או קנה מיד עמיתך, אל תונו, “or you buy something from your neighbour’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hand</span><span class="font5">, do not&nbsp;overcharge;” things that are passed from hand to hand are&nbsp;subject to the laws governing overcharging. Real estate&nbsp;which stays put, does not fall into that category.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל תונו איש את אחיו </span><span class="font5">,“do not cheat one another.” How does one “cheat? By selling a piece of land for more than its&nbsp;worth, seeing that it is going to have to be returned to the&nbsp;seller in the Yovel year. If it is a property that is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">subject to&nbsp;return to its original owner in the Jubilee year, then the term&nbsp;“overcharging” cannot be applied, as what he had sold was&nbsp;not a fixed amount of harvests expected. This is the meaning&nbsp;of the Rabbis having said that the law of overcharging does&nbsp;not apply to real estate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשיתם את חקותי</span><span class="font5">, “You will keep My laws;” this is&nbsp;a reference to all laws pertaining to land in the Holy Land and&nbsp;any laws subject to being performed only in the Holy Land as&nbsp;much as they apply during the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yovel</span><span class="font5"> years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת משפטי</span><span class="font5">, “and My ordinances;” for instance the prohibition to overcharge.(verse 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישבתם על הארץ לבטח</span><span class="font5">, “if you do this you will live in this and securely.” Your security will be bound up with your&nbsp;loyalty to G’d’s Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישבתם לבטח עליה</span><span class="font5">, “you will dwell safely in it.” The&nbsp;land itself will provide you with its strength so that your&nbsp;enemies cannot consume you. \compare Judges 6,3: ועלה&nbsp;מדין ועמלק, “and the Midianites and the Amalekites would&nbsp;come up (and raid them.) During serious times of hardship,&nbsp;they would not only raid you but would exile some of you and&nbsp;not leave any food for you to be able to subsist on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,21. לשלש שנים, “ </span><span class="font5">the three years. The three years are the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> year, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel</span><span class="font5"> year, and the year following it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,23. לא תמכר לצמיתות</span><span class="font5">, “do not sell with a clause to override the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel</span><span class="font5"> year, i.e. for always. The expression&nbsp;צמיתות, means something absolute, complete separation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Compare Psalms 94,23: 'יצמיתם ה, “the Lord will destroy them utterly, (beyond chance of recovery)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לצמיתות, </span><span class="font5">the vowel under the prefix ל time is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik,</span><span class="font5"> not a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach</span><span class="font5"> as in verse 30, to show that the vowel in this verse&nbsp;refers to the purchaser, whereas here it refers to the seller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גאולה תתנו לארץ</span><span class="font5">, “you shall grant redemption to&nbsp;the land,” so that it is clear that it had not been sold but only&nbsp;mortgaged as a loan. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rash’bam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וגאל את ממכר אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “he shall redeem what his&nbsp;brother had been forced to “sell,” i.e. his body, immediately.&nbsp;When referring to the seller, who had “sold his land,”&nbsp;because of financial distress, however, according to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra),</span><span class="font5"> the Torah adds a proviso, (verse 32) that the law of&nbsp;redemption applies only after a number of years had&nbsp;elapsed, as the interests of the purchaser had to be&nbsp;considered, seeing that he had acted in good faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והשיגה ידו</span><span class="font5">, “and he had again become wealthy;”&nbsp;either because he inherited wealth, or because he found a&nbsp;treasure, for instance. He is not however, permitted to secure&nbsp;a loan in order to buy back his property with some else’s&nbsp;money. (Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כדי גאולתו</span><span class="font5">, “sufficient in order to redeem it.” This teaches that the redemption process cannot be exercised&nbsp;piecemeal.(Sifra) This would have implied that he resents the&nbsp;person who at the time when the seller had been in need,&nbsp;had bought the property from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,29. בית מושב עיר חומה</span><span class="font5">, “a dwelling house in a fortified (walled) city;” seeing that the city is walled, the land inside it&nbsp;clearly was not meant ever to be used for agricultural&nbsp;purposes. This being so, G’d did not decree that if sold it had&nbsp;to revert to its original owner in the Jubilee year. The Jubilee&nbsp;legislation refers only to land that serves as its owner’s basic&nbsp;source of making a livelihood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: when someone buys himself a house in a walled city, he may be presumed to have done&nbsp;so with the intent of keeping it permanently. Most people do&nbsp;not feel comfortable when living in rented homes as they are&nbsp;always worried that the owner would not renew their rental&nbsp;contract at a price they could afford. This is why the Torah&nbsp;adds: לא יצא ביבל, “it will not revert in the Jubilee year.”&nbsp;However, fields and houses bordering on fields, not walled&nbsp;in, are all subject to the rules of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yovel</span><span class="font5"> legislation, being&nbsp;given back to the original owner free of any charge to be paid&nbsp;by that owner. Both of these kinds of property are more often&nbsp;leased than purchased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שנת ממכרו</span><span class="font5">, “not the calendar year, but the year relevant to the 50 year cycle of the Yovel, which repeats itself as if&nbsp;moving in a circle.” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ימים</span><span class="font5">, “years.” In other words, a year is not complete until the sun reverts to its original position in the following year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.30</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שנה תמימה</span><span class="font5">, “a full year.” In the event that this&nbsp;particular year was declared a leap year, this works to the&nbsp;advantage of the person wishing to redeem it. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעיר אשר לא חומה</span><span class="font5">, the word לא here is read as if it had been spelled לו, “his.” The reason for this is that it refers to&nbsp;the word ואיש at the beginning of the paragraph. At the&nbsp;beginning of that year that house had a wall around it. The&nbsp;word שדה is masculine, as we know from Leviticus 27,21 והיה&nbsp;השדה בצאתו, “and the field will be when it (he) goes out etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לו חומה לצמיתות, </span><span class="font5">“which (city) has a wall will be his (the purchaser’s) in perpetuity.” The vowel under the letter ל in&nbsp;לצמיתות is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach,</span><span class="font5"> just as the vowel under the letter ל under&nbsp;the word לקונה אותו, at the end of the verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובתי החצרים</span><span class="font5">, “but the houses of the villages;”&nbsp;seeing that such houses are frequently transformed into&nbsp;fields, they are considered as an integral part of the&nbsp;legislation as it applies to fields, which means that they revert&nbsp;to the original owner in the Jubilee year. (Compare Ibn Ezra&nbsp;in his abbreviated commentary).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גאולת עולם תהיה ללוים</span><span class="font5">, “the Levites will have an&nbsp;unlimited period during which to redeem their houses.” It&nbsp;does not matter if these houses are part of a walled city or of&nbsp;open villages, they are never sold in perpetuity, seeing that&nbsp;they are the only ancestral property the Levites own in the&nbsp;Holy Land as spelled out clearly in Numbers 35,3: והיו הערים&nbsp;להם לשבת ומגרשיהם יהיו לבהמתם ולרכושם ולכל חיתם,” and they&nbsp;shall have these cities to dwell in, and their open land shall&nbsp;be for their cattle and for their substance and for all their&nbsp;beasts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,33. ואשר יגאל מן הלוים, </span><span class="font5">“and if he redeems (buys) it from the Levites;” there is a special reason why purchase is&nbsp;called “redemption” by the Torah. The reason is that&nbsp;whatever the Levites sell originated with the ordinary&nbsp;Israelites from whose tithes, etc., they made their living. After&nbsp;all, they never had an ancestral share of land in the land of&nbsp;Israel. This means that whatever they sell had originally been&nbsp;owned by Israelites. The Levite therefore feels as if he had&nbsp;“redeemed” it from an Israelite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצא ממכר בית</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> had to choose between two different interpretations of these words, and it is clear that he&nbsp;chose the second alternative according to which: “then the&nbsp;house which has been sold will revert in the Jubilee year;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא אחוזתם</span><span class="font5">, a masculine mode for possession, with the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shuruk.</span><span class="font5"> We find the same construction in verse 34&nbsp;אחוזת עולם הוא להם, “it is a possession in perpetuity for them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בו ^mm</span><span class="font5">,”you shall uphold him;” in case anyone&nbsp;thought that he should be supported even if he had turned to&nbsp;criminal activities, the Torah cautions: עמך, “only as long as&nbsp;he conducts himself legally correct.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל תקח מאתו נשך ותרבית</span><span class="font5">, “do not accept from him&nbsp;any kind of interest or increase.” This paragraph has been&nbsp;repeated in the Torah when the Torah worded it in the&nbsp;inverted form as: “do not pay the lender interest or increase.”&nbsp;(verse 42, speaking of food.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.37. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את כספך</span><span class="font5">, “your money;” the emphasis is on the&nbsp;pronoun “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your;</span><span class="font5"> it is perfectly legal to lend money at interest&nbsp;when it is a gentile’s money. (A Jewish bank administering&nbsp;funds deposited by a gentile, may charge a Jew interest for&nbsp;such loans.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,38. אשר הוצאתי אתכם מארץ מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “Who has taken you out from the land of Egypt, while you had remained strangers&nbsp;there.” (Compare Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.40. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כשכיר כתושב יהיה עמך</span><span class="font5">, “as a hired servant and as a&nbsp;settler he shall be amongst you.” Both of these categories of&nbsp;people are hired hands; the difference between the first and&nbsp;the second category is that the first category consists of&nbsp;people hired on a day to day basis, while “settlers” have&nbsp;been hired for a year at a time. You are clearly not able to&nbsp;demand overly taxing work from a worker hired only for a&nbsp;day, as he would simply not come back on the next day if he&nbsp;felt taken advantage of; the Torah warns you not to take&nbsp;advantage of the fact that the “settler” does not have that&nbsp;legal option. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד שנת היובל יעבוד עמך</span><span class="font5">, “he must serve you until the Jubilee year.” When the Torah had written earlier that you&nbsp;must proclaim liberty for all slaves in the Jubilee year, (verse&nbsp;10), that had referred to a slave sold into slavery by the&nbsp;court. Here the Torah speaks of people who had sold&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">themselves</span><span class="font5"> into slavery because of financial stress not&nbsp;because they had stolen and could not repay their victim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.41. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הוא ובניו עמו</span><span class="font5">, “he and his sons with him.”&nbsp;Generally speaking, people who sell themselves are&nbsp;destitute. This being so, it may be assumed that when the&nbsp;father sold himself he included his children in the sale and&nbsp;they had agreed to this as where would they find sustenance&nbsp;if not with the father’s master?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושב אל משפחתו</span><span class="font5">, “and he will return to his family;” the first part of the paragraph dealt with people sold by the court, the&nbsp;latter half with people who sold themselves due to financial&nbsp;stress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,43. לא תרדה בו</span><span class="font5">, “do not force him to perform unnecessary tasks just to keep him busy.” The reason why&nbsp;the Torah repeats this warning is because, sadly, exploitation&nbsp;of slaves has become a common practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,47. או לעקר</span><span class="font5">, this term is the reverse of a תושב, settler. The literal meaning is “someone uprooted;” such people&nbsp;have been uprooted from their land, their people, and they&nbsp;are literally “rootless.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,50. משנת המכרו לו עד שנת היובל</span><span class="font5">, “from the year he had sold himself to him until the Jubilee year.” This is to remind&nbsp;you that this slave does not leave his master’s employ after&nbsp;six years. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.54. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם לא יגאל באלה</span><span class="font5">, “and if he is not redeemed by&nbsp;any of these means;” this is a reference to either the years&nbsp;remaining until the next Jubilee year, or to relatives of his;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצא בשנת היובל</span><span class="font5">, “he will go free in the Jubilee year,” but not after six years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא ובניו עמו</span><span class="font5">, “he and his sons with him.” Release of the father automatically includes release of his children. This is a&nbsp;moral lesson to teach us not to act like the gentiles act with&nbsp;their slaves. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.55</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי לי בני ישראל עבדים</span><span class="font5">, “for the Children of Israel are&nbsp;My servants;” previously the Torah wrote: כי עבדי הם, “for My&nbsp;servants are they;” (verse 42) on that occasion G’d had&nbsp;added that they were His servants already in Egypt and He&nbsp;contrasted this to show that someone who is His servant&nbsp;could not possibly be sold legally to anyone else, i.e. one&nbsp;Jew to another as they are both G’d’s servants (slaves)&nbsp;[Jews cannot opt out of their people or religion which are tied&nbsp;up one with other. Ed.] If such a Jew had been sold to a&nbsp;gentile, a member of another nation, I might have thought&nbsp;that this is not objectionable. The Torah therefore makes the&nbsp;point that it is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">equally</span><span class="font5"> objectionable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תעשו לכם אלילים</span><span class="font5">, “do not make for yourselves&nbsp;idols;” this law is repeated as if a Jew is sold to a gentile the&nbsp;subject of making himself an idol out of frustration over what&nbsp;has befallen him is quite understandable. Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifra</span><span class="font5"> on this verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את שבתותי תשמורו</span><span class="font5">, “You shall keep My Sabbaths;”&nbsp;according to the understanding of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum Yerushalmi,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;Torah here speaks about the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> years every seventh&nbsp;year. Those years are also called Sabbaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומקדשי תיראו</span><span class="font5">, “and revere My Sanctuary;” keep the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yovel </span><span class="font5">year as a holy year. (This is the interpretation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash&nbsp;Tanchuma)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat B’chukotai.</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם בחקתי תלכו</span><span class="font5">, “If you will walk in My statutes;” if&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">you</span><span class="font5"> will do what I decreed that you should do, also the&nbsp;clouds and the soil and the trees all of which have been&nbsp;created only for your sake, will do their share, as I have&nbsp;instructed them to do so.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גשמיכם בעתם</span><span class="font5">, “your rains at their appointed times.”&nbsp;If these rains would descend at the wrong time they would&nbsp;make your crops rot instead of ripen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'והשיג לכם דיש וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and your threshing will extend,&nbsp;etc.;” just as you will be performing My commandments&nbsp;constantly without interruption, I will heap blessing after&nbsp;blessing upon you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישבתם לבטח בארצכם</span><span class="font5">, “and you will live in your land feeling secure.” Previously, in 25,18, this has been worded&nbsp;slightly differently, when the Torah wrote: וישבתם על הארץ&nbsp;לבטח, “you will dwell on the land in security.” Here the Torah&nbsp;stresses the fact that you will consider the land as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">your </span><span class="font5">land.&nbsp;However, during a famine, people will be exiled as it says: לא&nbsp;תוסף תת כחה לך. נע ונד תהיה בארץ, “the land will not continue to&nbsp;give you from its strength; you will be a nomad on earth&nbsp;wandering from place to place.” (Genesis 4,12) Or, as we&nbsp;find in Job 15,23: ?נודד הוא ללחם איה, “he wanders searching&nbsp;for bread, where is he?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתתי שלום בארץ</span><span class="font5">, “I will give peace in the land;”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments, paraphrasing Isaiah 45,7: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עושה שלום ובורא&nbsp;את הכל</span><span class="font5">, “making peace and creating the All.” [The best&nbsp;interpretation of why this is plausible, is that having created&nbsp;evil, the Creator is forced to establish peace, else the evil will&nbsp;ruin all that He had created prior to it. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והשבתי חיה רעה, </span><span class="font5">“I will cause evil beasts to cease.” Isaiah has paraphrased this too, saying: Isaiah 64,5, “the lion will lie&nbsp;down peacefully next to the lamb.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,8. ורדפו מכם חמשה מאה, ומאה מכם רבבה ירדופו </span><span class="font5">“five of&nbsp;you will put one hundred 100 to flight, and one hundred of&nbsp;you will pursue ten thousand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והקימותי את בריתי אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “I will maintain My&nbsp;covenant with you.” This is the covenant I established with&nbsp;your forefathers that I will multiply you to become as&nbsp;numerous as the stars in heaven and the dust on the earth.&nbsp;(Genesis 26,4 and Genesis 28,14, Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואכלתם ישן נושן</span><span class="font5">, “you shall eat from stores long&nbsp;kept.” Seeing that you will have been blessed with abundant&nbsp;crops, so that at the end of the harvesting season you still&nbsp;have surpluses from the previous harvests, they will become&nbsp;mixed, and during each year you will eat from the proceeds&nbsp;of two harvests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והייתי לכם לאלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “and I will remain your G’d;”&nbsp;the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font5"> here is used as a simile for judge, the one&nbsp;who will avenge the wrongs done to you by your enemies.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מוטות עולכם</span><span class="font5">, “the bars of your yokes.” This is a&nbsp;reference to yokes which force the bearer to incline his head&nbsp;and neck towards the ground. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואולך אתכם קוממיות</span><span class="font5">, “I will enable you to walk upright with your heads held high.” This is reminiscent of Exodus 14,5&nbsp;describing the Israelites as holding their heads high when&nbsp;leaving Egypt. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את כל המצות האלה</span><span class="font5">, “all these commandments;” if&nbsp;you will fail to observe any of these commandments;” [it&nbsp;would be impossible to ignore all of these commandments.&nbsp;Ed.] We find a parallel expression to the construction in&nbsp;Exodus 20,10: לא תעשה כל מלאכה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">you shall not do any work,”&nbsp;or in verse Exodus 22,9: כל אלמנה ויתום לא תענון, “you are not&nbsp;to mistreat any widow or orphan.” [In both these verses the&nbsp;meaning of the word כל could not possibly be “all.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם בחקותי תמאסו</span><span class="font5">, “but if you will despise My&nbsp;statutes;” this is the opposite of “if you will “walk” in My&nbsp;statutes, אם בחקתי תלכו, “when you will “walk” according to My&nbsp;statutes, because you find them appropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואם את משפטי תגעל נפשכם</span><span class="font5">, “or if your souls despise My social laws;” this is the opposite of ואת מצותי תשמורו, “and you&nbsp;will observe My commandments.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לבלתי עשות</span><span class="font5">, “by not performing (them);” this is the opposite of ועשיתם אותם, “and you will perform them” (in verse&nbsp;3, of this chapter.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">להפרכם את בריתי, </span><span class="font5">“thereby breaking My covenant;” this is the opposite of והקימותי את בריתי אתכם, “I will maintain My&nbsp;covenant with you,” (in verse 9.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,16. אף אני אעשה זאת לכם</span><span class="font5">, “I also will do this to you.” The Torah warns that the punishment will fit the crime. He&nbsp;had promised that if we observe His commandments He will&nbsp;protect us against any and all possible diseases, (Exodus&nbsp;15,26), whereas if we will break His covenant (deliberately&nbsp;and in order to affront Him) He will actively expose us to&nbsp;them. Instead of acting as your physician, as I did when you&nbsp;observed My statutes, I will allow all kinds of diseases to&nbsp;afflict you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בהלה</span><span class="font5">, “terror,” the opposite of when I allowed you to go to sleep without worry, as spelled out in verse 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'בהלה את השחפת וגו</span><span class="font5">, “even consumption and fever;” this is to be understood as a special kind of terror caused by your&nbsp;being feverish. The word את in this verse is to be understood&nbsp;as של, “of, caused by.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[There follow detailed examples of diseases and afflictions, the author trying to explain their equivalent in our&nbsp;language. I have decided to skip this, as the principle has&nbsp;been established. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומדיבות נפש</span><span class="font5">, “and mental depression.” This is the opposite mental state of someone lording it over slaves as in&nbsp;verse 13, where the Israelites are reminded how they had&nbsp;had a physical and mental state of being enslaved while in&nbsp;Egypt. Their renewed state of mental depression is the&nbsp;second type of plague that G’d will employ if the people&nbsp;continue to despise and ignore His laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וזרעתם לריק זרעכם</span><span class="font5">, “you will sow your seed in vain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואכלוהו אויביכם</span><span class="font5">, “and your enemies will eat whatever these seeds produce. This is the opposite of the promise&nbsp;made in verse 5 if we observe the Torah. This is the fourth of&nbsp;the seven plagues threatened in verse 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתתי פני בכם</span><span class="font5">, “I will set My face against you.” This&nbsp;is the opposite of ופניתי אליכם, “I will turn to you with goodwill.”&nbsp;This is the fifth of the seven plagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונגפתם לפני אויביכם</span><span class="font5">, “you will be smitten before your enemies.” This is the reverse of the blessing that “you will&nbsp;pursue and overwhelm those who hate you.” This is the sixth&nbsp;of the seven plagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונסתם ואין רודף אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “you will flee even when no one pursues you.” This is the reverse of the blessing that five of&nbsp;you will put to flight a hundred of your enemies. (verse 8)&nbsp;This is the seventh of the seven plagues that will befall you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם עד אלה</span><span class="font5">, “if, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands the word&nbsp;בעד, as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעוד, </span><span class="font5">“still not,” we find a similar construction using&nbsp;this expression in Job 2,4: עור בעד עור, “skin for skin!”&nbsp;Compare also: ויסגור ה' בעדו, “G’d closed the door (of the ark)&nbsp;on his behalf.” (Genesis 7.16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויספתי ליסרה אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “I will continue to discipline you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבע</span><span class="font5">, on account of the seventh year </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(sh’mittah)</span><span class="font5"> during which you did not release your hold on material possessions,&nbsp;especially by working the land. In the event you consider this&nbsp;interpretation far fetched, compare what the Torah writes in&nbsp;verse 34, where it describes the soil of the land of Israel&nbsp;making up during their exile for the years when its owners did&nbsp;not observe the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shmittah</span><span class="font5"> legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">על חטאתיכם, “for your (various) sins.” Compare Psalms 44,23 where the psalmist writes: כי עליך הורגנו כל היום, “since&nbsp;for Your sake we are being killed all day long.” (the word על&nbsp;being used in the same sense) Also compare Psalms 69,8:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כי עליך נשאתי חרפה, “for on Your account I have been reviled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושברתי את גאון עוזכם</span><span class="font5">, “I will break the pride of your&nbsp;power;” this has to be contrasted with verse 13 where the&nbsp;Torah described G’d as breaking all the yokes that the&nbsp;Egyptians had used to keep the Israelites down. This is stage&nbsp;one in this process of humbling the Jewish people. Step two&nbsp;follows with:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתתי שמיכם ברזל</span><span class="font5">, “I will make your heaven as iron;” this is the contrast to verse 4 where rain was promised to fall at&nbsp;the appropriate time of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת ארצכם נחושת, </span><span class="font5">“and your soil like copper.” This contrasts the word בעתם, “at their proper time” in verse 4&nbsp;above. This was a separate blessing, i.e. the third one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word נחושת, “copper,” is a noun, as in Psalms 18,35: ונחתה קשת נחושה זרועותי, “my arms can bend a bow of&nbsp;copper.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותם לריק כוכחם</span><span class="font5">, “your strength will be spent in&nbsp;vain.” This is the opposite of verse 5, ובציר ישיג את זרע, “and&nbsp;the grape harvest will last until it is time to sew again.” We&nbsp;find the expression כח used in connection with harvest in&nbsp;Genesis 4,12 when G’d tells Kayin that the earth will not&nbsp;continue to give its strength to him as it had cooperated with&nbsp;him in hiding his brother’s blood. This is the fourth curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא תתן ארצכם את יבולה</span><span class="font5">, “your land will not yield its harvest.” This is the fifth curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא יתן פריו</span><span class="font5">, “the trees will not yield their fruit.” This is the sixth curse. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this is a twofold curse. (as it&nbsp;refers both to the trunks of the trees and their fruit)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם תלכו עמי קרי</span><span class="font5">, “but if you will walk with Me as if&nbsp;what happens to you is only coincidental;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבע על חטאתכם</span><span class="font5">, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">seven</span><span class="font5"> plagues;” just as your sins were committed by ignoring the legislation governing activities in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">seventh</span><span class="font5"> year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'והשלחתי בכם וגו</span><span class="font5">, “I shall send forth against you,&nbsp;etc.;” this corresponds to the blessing in verse 6, where G’d&nbsp;promises to destroy or keep in check wild beasts as a reward&nbsp;for our keeping the Torah. Seeing that the positive virtues are&nbsp;always evident in greater measure than the negative ones,&nbsp;when speaking about the wild beasts in the blessings, when&nbsp;referring to the wild beasts in the curses, the Torah uses the&nbsp;whole species, חיה רעה, whereas when referring to them in&nbsp;the context of His blessings, He mentions only “free roaming&nbsp;animals of the field,” not the whole species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושכלה אתכם</span><span class="font5">,”^ will cause you bereavement amongst your children;” this is the opposite of when in the blessings&nbsp;the Torah portrayed you as pursuing your enemies (verse 9).&nbsp;Now that you have suffered bereavements you will not have&nbsp;enough people left to pursue your enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והכריתה את בהמתכם</span><span class="font5">, “it will destroy your cattle;” this corresponds to the blessing in verse 6 where wild beasts are&nbsp;destroyed, thus protecting your cattle against attack. The&nbsp;word מן הארץ, in verse 6, a second time is the link to the word&nbsp;from the land is the link to the והמעיטה, “it will diminish your&nbsp;numbers,” in our verse here. [The reader will notice to what&nbsp;length our author goes to demonstrate how the curses match&nbsp;the blessings throughout this chapter. Ed.] The word והמעיטה&nbsp;is exactly the opposite of the words והרביתי, “I will make more&nbsp;numerous,” in verse 9 of the blessings in our chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונשמו דרכיכם</span><span class="font5">, “your ways will become desolate.” This is the opposite of ונתתי שלום בארץ, “I will grant peace in your&nbsp;land;” [when no one will be scared to walk alone on these&nbsp;ways. Ed.] This is the conclusion of the seven curses as&nbsp;explained by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26, 24. והלכתי אף אני עמכם בקרי</span><span class="font5">, “and I too will walk with you as if what happens to you is only coincidental, and not&nbsp;related to your disloyalty to Me.” [This will make it harder for&nbsp;you to return to Me in penitence, as you cannot see cause&nbsp;and effect in your history. Ed.] This is another example of the&nbsp;punishment fitting the crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,25</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חרב</span><span class="font5">, “sword,” this is the opposite of the promise&nbsp;in verse 6, that no sword will cross the boundaries of your&nbsp;land. Regarding this “sword,” Isaiah 1,20, has said that you&nbsp;will be devoured by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נוקמת נקם הברית </span><span class="font5">“it shall execute the vengeance of the covenant (that has been broken by you.) The Torah had&nbsp;warned of this already in Exodus 24,8, when it was first&nbsp;described as a great blessing for you. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vayikra Rabbah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">35,6, the author, quoting Isaiah 1,18, אם תאבו ושמעתם טוב&nbsp;הארץ תאכלו, speaks of if you will agree and listen you will eat&nbsp;of the best the earth has to offer,” adding that “you will be&nbsp;devoured by the sword if you do not listen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds on our verse that there is also a vengeance that is not related to this covenant between the Jewish&nbsp;people and their G’d, citing the gouging out of King&nbsp;Tzidkiyahu’s eyes for having broken a covenant with King&nbsp;Nebuchadnezzar. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Torat Kohanim)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is a form of vengeance not mentioned in the Torah. [The first time we encounter it occurs with Shimshon, whose&nbsp;eyes were gouged out by the Philisitines, but -in his case-according to our sages, it was actually retribution not for what&nbsp;he had done to the Philistines, but by what he had done to&nbsp;himself by following his eyes when repeatedly choosing&nbsp;Philistine women to cohabit with. The Torah, and Shimshon’s&nbsp;father, had warned him not to rely on what his eyes saw&nbsp;when choosing a wife. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is yet another kind of vengeance not mentioned in the Torah, which is also described as violation of a&nbsp;covenant; When the Torah wrote in Deuteronomy 28,69, at&nbsp;the end of Moses’ version of the reprimands, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tochachah,</span><span class="font5"> אלה&nbsp;דברי בהרית, “these are the words of (warning) of the covenant&nbsp;concluded with the people at Mount Chorev,” the very word:&nbsp;אלה “these,” hints to us that in addition to “these,” there may&nbsp;be other contractual and mutual obligations, but not&nbsp;necessarily the ones entered into at Mount Sinai. [Keeping&nbsp;one’s solemn promise surely did not have to become part of&nbsp;morality only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> the Jewish people accepted the Torah.&nbsp;Our forefathers already encountered this problem in their&nbsp;lives, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונאספתם אל עריכם</span><span class="font5">, “you shall be gathered within your cities;” you will have to take refuge </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">within</span><span class="font5"> the walls of your&nbsp;cities from the swords of your enemies. Even this defensive&nbsp;measure will prove useless; because pestilence will break&nbsp;out amongst you within these cities, and you will be delivered&nbsp;into the hands of your enemies. This is the second curse&nbsp;contrasted with verse 13 where G’d promised that He will&nbsp;lead us in upright and self-confident posture. The third&nbsp;plague follows when the Torah writes here that we will be&nbsp;delivered to our enemies as opposed to verse 8, when the&nbsp;Jewish people were described as so powerful and feared that&nbsp;a mere one hundred of them put to flight 10000 of their&nbsp;attackers. This is the third of the seven curses, the fourth&nbsp;being that you will fall before your enemies instead of at least&nbsp;being able to save your lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,26. בשברי לכם מטה הלחם</span><span class="font5">, ”when I break your staff of bread;” this curse is the reverse of the blessing in verse 5&nbsp;that we will eat our bread and find that it satisfies our&nbsp;requirements and we will be sated. This is the fifth curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והשיבו לחמכם במשקל</span><span class="font5">, “and they shall deliver your bread again by weight;” the vowel under the letter is a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Dough which has been put inside the oven for baking will be&nbsp;found not to have increased in weight. The entire expression&nbsp;symbolises how even the little that is available will be&nbsp;measured minutely. This curse is contrasted with the&nbsp;blessing in verse 10 where the abundance of food is&nbsp;described as lasting well into the next harvest season. It is&nbsp;the sixth of the seven curses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואכלתם ולא תשבעו</span><span class="font5">, “even when you eat that you will not experience the feeling of having been sated.” This is the&nbsp;opposite of the blessing in verse 10 that you will eat from&nbsp;grain long held in storage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,28. ויסרתי</span><span class="font5">, “I will chastise;” the vowels here are:&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va,</span><span class="font5"> followed by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik.</span><span class="font5"> [strong conjugation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">piel.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.29</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואכלתם בשר בניכם</span><span class="font5">, “you will eat the flesh of your&nbsp;children.” This curse corresponds to the blessing in verse 9&nbsp;והפרתי אתכם, “I will make you fruitful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand this as referring to children who are from highly respected families getting&nbsp;married to families of far lower social standing, by trading&nbsp;their superior ancestry for making an alliance with a wealthier&nbsp;family through marriage. If so, this would be the first curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והשמדתי את במותיכם והכרתי את חמניכם</span><span class="font5">, “I will&nbsp;destroy your high places and cut down your sun pillars;” This&nbsp;is not part of the curses, as it refers simply to your idols being&nbsp;destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חמניכם</span><span class="font5">, from the word חמה, another word for “sun, שמש; the letter נ in this word is extraneous, just as the letter נ in the&nbsp;word נשים for “women” is extraneous in the expression: נשים&nbsp;רחמניות, (Lamentations 4,10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתתי את פגריכם על פגרי גלוליכם</span><span class="font5">, “I will cast your carcasses next to the carcasses of your idols.” This curse corresponds&nbsp;to the blessing in verse 12: “I will be your G’d, and you will be&nbsp;My people.” This is the second curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וגעלה נפשי אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “My soul shall abhor you.” This corresponds to the blessing in verse 11 that “My soul will not&nbsp;abhor you.” This is the third curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עריכם חרבה</span><span class="font5">, ”your cities will be waste;” this must&nbsp;be contrasted with the blessing in verse 5, “you will pursue&nbsp;etc.” This is the fourth curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והשימותי את מקדשיכם</span><span class="font5">, “I will lay waste your sanctuaries.” This is to be contrasted with the blessing of ונתתי משכני&nbsp;בתוככם, “I will set My Tabernacle amongst you in verse 11.&nbsp;This is the fifth curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא אריח ברית ניחוחכם</span><span class="font5">, “I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.” This may be contrasted with the blessing in&nbsp;verse 12: והתהלכתי בתוככם, “I will go for walks amongst you.”&nbsp;This is the sixth of the curses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והשמותי אני את הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “I will bring the land into&nbsp;desolation;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.33.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How am I going to do this? ואתכם אזרה בגויים, “I&nbsp;will scatter you among the nations.” This is to be contrasted&nbsp;with verse 5 of the blessings where the Torah promised that&nbsp;you will dwell securely in your land. This is the seventh of the&nbsp;curses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושממו עליה אויביכם</span><span class="font5">, but your enemies will be amazed by the desolation in your country. Your cities will also become&nbsp;desolate, i.e. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארצכם שממה ועריכם יהיו חרבה</span><span class="font5">. We find a repetition&nbsp;here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,34. אז תרצה הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “then the land be recompensed for the Sabbath (years) [during which it had been worked&nbsp;although it should have been allowed to rest. Ed.] After 6 of&nbsp;the evil decrees which we demonstrated as representing a&nbsp;measure for measure type of punishment have already been&nbsp;endured by you, i.e. you should work the land for six years&nbsp;consecutively and then let it rest during the seventh year, the&nbsp;land will finally enjoy a rest during the seventh year. It will&nbsp;make up for all the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> years you had not observed&nbsp;during the 70 years of your exile. [It will experience 70&nbsp;consecutive such </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> years. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תרצה; </span><span class="font5">this expression also occurs in the sense in which we have translated it in Psalms 49,14: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואחריהם בפיהם ירצו</span><span class="font5">,&nbsp;“and their descendants </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">approve</span><span class="font5"> of them with what they have&nbsp;learned from their mouths.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different approach to our verse: the word תרצה is to be understood as equivalent to תשלים, “will conclude.” Compare&nbsp;Job 14,6: עד ירצה כשכיר יומו, “until he finishes his day like a&nbsp;hireling.” Or: כי נרצה עונו, “for her sin has been expiated;”&nbsp;(Isaiah 40,2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third interpretation: the meaning of the word is: “to become reconciled, to have made peace, settled a&nbsp;disagreement.” This would be reflected by Psalms 77,8: ולא&nbsp;יוסיף לרצות עוד, “and will He never again show favour?”&nbsp;Psalms 145,16, ומשביע לכל חי רצון, “and You feed every living&nbsp;creature to its heart content,” also reflects this sentiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אז תשבת הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “then the land will rest.” The letter ב has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach,</span><span class="font5"> [the word being a verb. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל ימי השמה</span><span class="font5">, “during all the years of its being&nbsp;desolate;” it will be as if emptied out of its people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תשבות</span><span class="font5">, “it shall have rest;” the word is spelled with the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cholem,</span><span class="font5"> on account of the cantillation mark </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">etnachta&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">under it. Compare Psalms 114,3: הים ראה וינוס, “the sea saw&nbsp;and fled;” and verse 34 that we just read: והרצת את שבתתיה,&nbsp;“and repay her Sabbaths.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והנשארים בכם והבאתי מורך בלבבם</span><span class="font5">, “and I will bring&nbsp;faintness into the hearts of those that are left of them;” I shall&nbsp;continue to heap more curses upon them until they have&nbsp;endured 49 curses corresponding to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel</span><span class="font5"> cycle of 49&nbsp;years that they have ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מורך בלבבם</span><span class="font5">, this is the first plague; ורדף אותם קול עלה, “and even the sound of a leaf fluttering in the wind will frighten&nbsp;them.” This is the second plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונסו מנוסת חרב</span><span class="font5">, “they will flee from it as if fleeing from a sword.” This is the third plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונפלו ואין רודף</span><span class="font5">, “they will fall even though there was no pursuer.” This is the fourth plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.37. וכשלו איש באחיו כמפני חרב ורודף אין</span><span class="font5">, “they will stumble upon one another, as if on account of a sword&nbsp;although there is no pursuer;” there is some repetition here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא תהיה לכם תקומה</span><span class="font5">, “you will not have the strength to stand up to your enemies.” This is the fifth curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.38. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואבדת בגויים</span><span class="font5">, “you will perish among the nations.”&nbsp;This is the sixth curse. Exile is also called </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אובד,</span><span class="font5"> as we know&nbsp;from Psalms 119,176: תעיתי כשה אובד, “I have strayed like a&nbsp;lost sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואכלה אתכם ארץ אויביכם</span><span class="font5">, “and the land of your enemies will eat you up.&quot; This is the seventh plague. What is meant&nbsp;here is that the frequent need for you to change your place of&nbsp;residence and to move to different climates, will not give you&nbsp;an opportunity to acclimatize to the climate and result in&nbsp;disease and death. (Ibn Ezra).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.41. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אף אני אלך עמכם בקרי</span><span class="font5">, “also I will walk with you as if&nbsp;what befalls you was coincidental; even though by now the&nbsp;people had confessed that they had sinned, seeing that they&nbsp;had not taken the next step and done penitence, I cannot&nbsp;relent yet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או אז יכנע לבבם הערל</span><span class="font5">, “if perchance their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled;” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">then </span><span class="font5">I will remember My covenant,&nbsp;etc;” I will continue to reciprocate then in their favour, as&nbsp;recognition of their penitence; as we know from Hoseah 14,4:&nbsp;ומודה ועוזב ירוחם, “[inaccurate quote, the prophet says there&nbsp;that when the people no longer treat their man made idols as&nbsp;deities, they will experience G’d’s mercy. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.42. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזכרתי את בריתי יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “I will remember My&nbsp;covenant with Yaakov;” seeing that none of Yaakov's&nbsp;children were disloyal to his teachings, the Torah did not use&nbsp;the word “אף,” “anger,” in connection with Yaakov, as during&nbsp;all his 147 years he had been loyal to G’d, and that is also&nbsp;why the Torah here mentions the word: “My covenant,” first.&nbsp;According to Ibn Ezra, not all the years that Avraham lived&nbsp;were lived after G’d had made a covenant with him. Yaakov&nbsp;also experienced prophetic insights at an earlier age than his&nbsp;father and grandfather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והארץ אזכור, </span><span class="font5">“and I will remember the land (fondly).” This statement annuls the two statements in verses 32 and 20 in&nbsp;which the bounty of the land was denied to the errant Jewish&nbsp;people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.43. ותרץ הארץ את שבתותיה, והם ירצו את עונם</span><span class="font5">, “and the land will be paid her Sabbaths, and they shall be paid for&nbsp;their sins.” This is the retribution for 49 years of ignoring the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel</span><span class="font5"> legislation during which also seven </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> years&nbsp;were ignored. There will be reconciliation between the people&nbsp;and their G’d. They will be penitent, admitting that what they&nbsp;had been made to suffer was only because of their disloyalty&nbsp;to their G’d, and their totally negative attitude to His Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of this verse: “they will complete thee punishment for their sins”. A similar&nbsp;construction to this would be found in Samuel I 28,10: אם יקרך&nbsp;עון בדבר הזה, “if you would be punished for a sin on account of&nbsp;this matter.“ [King Sha-ul to the witch of Endor. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.44. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואף גם זאת בהיותם בארץ אויביהם</span><span class="font5">, “and yet, in spite of&nbsp;their being in the land of their enemies, etc.;” what has been&nbsp;left for the surviving Israelites who have been deprived of all&nbsp;that had made their lives worth living?” G’d promises that the&nbsp;most precious of their possessions, the Torah, they had not&nbsp;been deprived of, and this will make them distinguished even&nbsp;when in exile and the nations look down upon them. This is&nbsp;what the famous liturgist had in mind when he composed the&nbsp;phrase: ואין שיור רק התורה הזאת, “there is nothing left except&nbsp;this Torah.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[zechor brit,</span><span class="font5"> recited as part of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">selichot,</span><span class="font5"> near&nbsp;the end of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ne’ilah</span><span class="font5"> prayer on the Day of Atonement.” Ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.45. וזכרתי להם ברית ראשונם, “</span><span class="font5">I will remember in their favour the covenant with the earlier generations;” from this&nbsp;verse we learn that the covenant was concluded with the&nbsp;different tribes at the time when the people left Egypt. The&nbsp;curses, i.e. admonitions, we have just read are referred to as&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">brit,</span><span class="font5"> covenant, as spelled out in Deuteronomy 28,69: אלה&nbsp;דברי הברית מלבד הברית אשר כרת אתם בחורב, “these are the words&nbsp;of the covenant, apart from the covenant He made with them&nbsp;at Mount Chorev.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,2. איש</span><span class="font5">, “a man;” (adult) by the Torah’s use of the word איש, I might have been misled into thinking that what&nbsp;follows applies only to male adults, and not to female adults;&nbsp;in order to prevent such an error being made, the Torah adds&nbsp;the word: נפשות, ”persons,” regardless of which gender.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יפליא</span><span class="font5">, similar to the word יפריש, “he will set aside;” this is one of the words that have different meanings depending on&nbsp;in which context they appear. In fact, sometimes the same&nbsp;word may mean the opposite in one place from what it&nbsp;means in another place. For instance: in Deuteronomy 17,8&nbsp;the line: כי יפלא ממך דבר למשפט, means “if a matter involving&nbsp;legal litigation is too difficult for you to decide,” in other&nbsp;words, the meaning of the root of the word is “something that&nbsp;is hidden;” on the other hand, here, it refers to something&nbsp;over and </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">beyond</span><span class="font5"> your normal powers of perception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other examples of words appearing as having a meaning opposite what they do elsewhere is the word דשן,&nbsp;which may mean: surfeit, abundance and it may mean&nbsp;useless leftovers of material that has been burnt. (Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">27,3, or being full of sap, (Psalms 92,15.) The author cites&nbsp;three or four more examples, making the same point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נדר בערכך</span><span class="font5">, the Torah compares vows to the subject of ערכין in our chapter, seeing that both types of free willed&nbsp;undertakings must be </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">honoured</span><span class="font5"> without undue delay. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,4. וא</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נקבה הוא</span><span class="font5">, “and if she (the subject of the&nbsp;valuation) is a female person;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולנקבה שלשי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שקלי</span><span class="font5">ם, “and the valuation of a female during the same age group is thirty shekel.” Basically, the&nbsp;monetary value of a female person is roughly half of that of a&nbsp;male. This reflects the fact that the first woman, Eve, had&nbsp;been taken from the body of the first man, so that G’d’s work&nbsp;was only half that of what it had been when He created&nbsp;Adam, the first human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,7. וא</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מבן ששי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שנה ומעלה</span><span class="font5">, “and if the person whose valuation is being “donated to the Temple treasury is above&nbsp;the age of sixty at the time;” whence do we know that if that&nbsp;person at the time of the valuation is exactly sixty years old it&nbsp;is valued as if between twenty and sixty years of age? We&nbsp;derive this from the wording of “sixty or </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">above</span><span class="font5">.” [That word is&nbsp;unnecessary unless it was meant to teach us something&nbsp;new. Ed.] I might think that this rule applies only to the&nbsp;sixtieth year, and not to the fifth, twentieth, etc; we derive the&nbsp;rule for those years by the use of logic when comparing it to&nbsp;the valuation of the five year old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the reason why the females’ valuation is so much less that that of males of the same age, this is based on the&nbsp;fact that, generally, males perform heavier physical labour&nbsp;than women. When men age, their ability to perform heavy&nbsp;labour, declines at a more rapid pace than that of females of&nbsp;comparable age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל אשר יתן ממנו</span><span class="font5">, “all that he gives of it, etc.” the&nbsp;Torah employs the masculine mode here although the word&nbsp;בהמה, the subject here, is a beast in the feminine mode. This&nbsp;is not a unique occurrence, as other such examples are to be&nbsp;found in Leviticus 6,8, where the pronoun ממנו, which is&nbsp;masculine, is used in reference to the noun מנחה, which is&nbsp;feminine; two more such anomalies occur in Numbers 32,5&nbsp;and Genesis 13,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;טוב ברע או רע בטוב</span><span class="font5">, “(substituting) good for inferior,&nbsp;or inferior for superior. The reason why the Torah had to&nbsp;write </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">both</span><span class="font5"> alternatives is because the owner does so as he is&nbsp;not sure which is superior and which is inferior. In the case of&nbsp;the animals proving to be diseased and therefore at least one&nbsp;of them being disqualified as an offering, the donor did not&nbsp;know which of the sicknesses is the more serious one.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם כל בהמה טמאה</span><span class="font5">, “he places a ritually impure&nbsp;animal before the priest (as a sacrifice) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that&nbsp;this cannot be understood literally, as it is too obvious. He&nbsp;therefore understands the word טמאה here as referring to a&nbsp;blemished animal, the owner not knowing if that blemish was&nbsp;serious enough to disqualify said animal. The Torah teaches&nbsp;that such a decision must be left to the officiating priest. If it&nbsp;is a temporary blemish, said animal is fit as a sacrifice as&nbsp;soon as its blemish has disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,13. ויסף חמישתו</span><span class="font5">, “he shall add a fifth part thereof;”&nbsp;actually 25%, so that when combined, the addition is a fifth of&nbsp;the total. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> folio 57) The same&nbsp;ratio for penalties applies to houses that are ancestral&nbsp;properties or to ancestrally owned fields. The same ratio&nbsp;applies also when the second tithe has to be redeemed, as&nbsp;the owner cannot transport the original all the way to&nbsp;Jerusalem. The background to this legislation which applies&nbsp;only to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">original</span><span class="font5"> owner, not someone who has acquired it,&nbsp;is that an original owner may use sanctifying this property by&nbsp;arguing that seeing it is all his anyway, he may thereby avoid&nbsp;leaving those parts of the harvest which the Torah wanted&nbsp;him to leave for the poor and the orphaned. If, however, the&nbsp;owner sanctified something, no part of which was intended&nbsp;by the Torah as a tithe (tax) that he had to give away&nbsp;anyway, Shmuel in the Talmud ruled that he can redeem the&nbsp;whole for an addition of the smallest coin of the realm.(Baba&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Metzia</span><span class="font5"> 57)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,20. ואם מכר את השדה לאיש אחר</span><span class="font5">, “but if he had sold the field to someone else;” the prefix ו in the word ואם is to be&nbsp;understood as if the Torah had written: או, “or.” This is one of&nbsp;many such places where the letter ו is to be understood as:&nbsp;“or.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,21. והיה השדה בצאתו ביובל</span><span class="font5">, “but when the field goes out in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel</span><span class="font5"> year;” this verse teaches that the word: שדה&nbsp;in Hebrew is of the masculine gender.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,24. לאשר קנהו אתו</span><span class="font5">, “to the one of whom it had been purchased.” This purchaser had never been in a legal&nbsp;position that enabled him to sanctify the soil of that field. He&nbsp;could only sanctify the fruit that it produced while it had been&nbsp;in his possession. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,26. אם שור אם שה, לה' הוא</span><span class="font5">, “be it ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s.” The original firstborn male animal must be offered,&nbsp;no substitute under any circumstances. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,28. אך כל חרם</span><span class="font5">, “however no segregated matter that&nbsp;had been presented to the Temple treasury without any&nbsp;further specification;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> quotes a disagreement between&nbsp;the sages as to who is the recipient of items sanctified&nbsp;without a specific address. According to one opinion such&nbsp;monies or goods become the property of the Temple&nbsp;treasury, meaning that they are to be used for repairs to the&nbsp;Temple, etc.; the other opinion is that such monies, etc.&nbsp;described here as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cherem,</span><span class="font5"> segregated property, are to be&nbsp;distributed amongst the priests whose property they become.&nbsp;He also interprets the line at the end of our verse כל חרם קדש&nbsp;קדשים הוא, “every segregated matter is most holy,” in that&nbsp;sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא ימכר ולא יגאל, </span><span class="font5">“it must not be sold (for secular use) nor is it subject to being redeemed,” In other words, the&nbsp;monetary value of such segregated items must be given to&nbsp;the priests. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this line also applies to&nbsp;segregated property without a specific address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Verse 29, according to the dissenting opinion the Torah speaks of items segregated by the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">priests</span><span class="font5"> without a specific&nbsp;address. If someone were to say “the value of this animal&nbsp;which had been destined for a sacrifice on the altar, shall be&nbsp;segregated for me,” he meant that instead it should be given&nbsp;to one or more of the other priests. If, however, he had said&nbsp;the same of segregated property of a non priest, he would&nbsp;have to give the value of the item he referred to the Temple&nbsp;treasury. [Rabbi Chavell, in his annotations, questions the&nbsp;premise that if you declare something banned that is not&nbsp;yours has any legal meaning at all, as it is an accepted rule&nbsp;that no one can declare someone </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">else’s</span><span class="font5"> property as holy,&nbsp;segregated or changing its status at all. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Erchin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 28, if someone, looking at an ox, were to say: “this ox shall&nbsp;become a burnt offering,” the treasury will decide on the&nbsp;market value of such an ox, and the person having made this&nbsp;vow would have to pay for a burnt offering of an ox in&nbsp;accordance with the amount of money the priest judges that&nbsp;he would have been willing to spend. He will have to give&nbsp;that amount to the treasury, although the animal is not being&nbsp;offered as a burnt offering, seeing it had not belonged to the&nbsp;person who made the vow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,29. כל חרם אשר יחרם מן האדם</span><span class="font5">, “and any condemned person who has been banned from mankind; The Torah&nbsp;speaks of a person who has been sentenced to death by a&nbsp;Jewish court. The somewhat awkward wording of this verse&nbsp;is due to the four different types of death penalty that a&nbsp;Jewish court can impose for different types of capital&nbsp;offences. Our verse applies to any of these kinds of death&nbsp;sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,30. מזרע הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “whether of the seed of the earth;” this&nbsp;wording is intended to include garlic, green mustard, and&nbsp;cress. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מזרע הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “seed that is normally planted in the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,32. העשירי יהיה קדש, </span><span class="font5">every tenth (animal) shall be declared holy.” If someone while counting, erroneously called&nbsp;the ninth “tenth,” or called the eleventh “tenth,” he is taken by&nbsp;his word and that animal also becomes holy, and the animal&nbsp;is offered as a peace offering. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,34. אלה המצות</span><span class="font5">, “these are the commandments;” no&nbsp;future prophet has the authority to either add to them or to&nbsp;cancel any of them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “to the Children of Israel.” The word אל is to be understood as in Exodus 6,13: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצו</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “He&nbsp;commanded them to the Children of Israel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our author explains as a postscript that the reason that this Book is generally called: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Torat Kohanim,”</span><span class="font5"> the Torah for&nbsp;the priests, is that it deals mainly with the different laws that&nbsp;apply only to the priests and Levites. He points out that even&nbsp;the Christians called it: Leviticus, “Book of the Levites.’</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Bamidbar</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,1. במדבר סיני</span><span class="font5">, “in the desert of Sinai;” at what location did G’d speak to Moses? From the Tabernacle; before the&nbsp;Tabernacle had been erected, G’d had communicated from&nbsp;the top of Mount Sinai. From the day the Ten&nbsp;Commandments had been given, G’d’s presence had not&nbsp;moved away from Mount Sinai until the day after the&nbsp;Tabernacle had been erected on the first day of Nissan of the&nbsp;second year, as we have been told in the Talmud, tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beytzah,</span><span class="font5"> folio </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">בשנת השנית לצאתם, (on the first of the second month) in the second year of the Exodus. Regarding all other matters,&nbsp;the first of Tishrey was considered as the first day of the New&nbsp;Year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שאו את ראש</span><span class="font5">, “take a count of the sum;” seeing that&nbsp;within twenty days the Israelites would break camp and start&nbsp;marching toward the Holy Land, as reported in chapter 10&nbsp;verse 29 of this Book. There it has been spelled out: נוסעים&nbsp;אנחנו אל המקום, “we are about to set out on the journey to the&nbsp;place, etc;” (Moses speaking to his father-in-law Yitro).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מבן עשרים שנה ומעלה</span><span class="font5">, “from twenty years old and up;”&nbsp;from that age and up the males were considered as mature&nbsp;enough to serve in the army. Based on this verse, our sages&nbsp;at the end of chapter 5 in Ethics of our fathers, made the well&nbsp;known statement: בן עשרים לרדוף, “when having attained the&nbsp;age of twenty, one is fit to join the pursuit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל יצא צבא </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">בישראל</span><span class="font5">, “all who are able to go to war on behalf of Israel;” the repetition of this word excluded the&nbsp;mixed multitude who had joined the people only at the&nbsp;Exodus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,5. לראובן אליצור בן שדיאור, “</span><span class="font5">of Reuven, Elitzur son of Sh’deyur. He was mentioned first, as the original Reuven had&nbsp;been Yaakov’s firstborn son.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,6. שלומיאל בו צורישדי</span><span class="font5">, “Shlumiel son of Tzurishaday.” This was his name. He was also known as זמרי בן סלוא,&nbsp;(compare Numbers 25,14) or שאול בן הכנענית</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">Saul, son the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Canaanite woman.” (According to the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 82 where this statement is elaborated on.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,10. לבני יוסף</span><span class="font5">, “of the Children of Joseph;” they are mentioned after the children of Leah as a sign of respect to&nbsp;their mother Rachel. The Torah mentions the younger son&nbsp;Ephrayim first, as this is what their father Yaakov did when&nbsp;he blessed them before his death. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ephrayim and Menashe, though </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">grandsons</span><span class="font5"> of Yaakov, are mentioned before his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">son</span><span class="font5"> Binyamin, as combined they&nbsp;represented Rachel’s firstborn son Joseph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,12. לדן</span><span class="font5">, “of Dan;” he is mentioned first among the four sons of the concubines, as he was the firstborn among them.&nbsp;Asher is mentioned next to him, as his tribe was the leading&nbsp;one in the group of tribes encamped around his flag.&nbsp;(Numbers 2,27) This is followed by Gad, who was the&nbsp;firstborn son of Leah’s servant maid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,16. אלה קריאי</span><span class="font5">, “these are the elect, etc.” the word קריאי,&nbsp;is read as if it had been spelled ;קרואי</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראשי אלפי ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “the heads of the thousands of Israel.” Each of the people named here was the head of the&nbsp;thousands belonging to his tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתילדו</span><span class="font5">, “they declared their pedigrees;” (according&nbsp;to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of this word: they asked their parents for details of when they had been born in order to&nbsp;determine if they had been twenty years old at the time of the&nbsp;Exodus. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כאשר צוה ה' את משה</span><span class="font5">, “as the Lord had commanded&nbsp;Moses;” these words belong to verse 18, where Moses is&nbsp;reported as having assembled all the people. [I suppose our&nbsp;author found a sentence commencing with “as, כאשר,” as&nbsp;somewhat unusual. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויפקדם במדבר סיני</span><span class="font5">, “he counted them in the desert of Sinai.” The tribes were counted there, one after another in&nbsp;the order in which their respective flags had been arranged</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He commenced the count with the eldest son of Yaakov, Reuven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,20. ויהיו בני ראובן</span><span class="font5">, “and the members of the tribe of Reuven, (the males over 20 years) amounted to, etc;” the&nbsp;tribes (excluding the tribe of Levi) were counted there one&nbsp;after another, in the order of their respective flags. Therefore&nbsp;Moses began with Reuven, followed by Yehudah the leader&nbsp;of all the tribes, followed Ephrayim and Dan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראובן בכור ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “Reuven, Israel’s firstborn;” this point had to be made again as the first tribe in the marching order&nbsp;was Yehudah. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span><span class="font5"> The reason why this point was&nbsp;made by the Torah at this juncture, was to explain that the&nbsp;only reason why he was counted first was that biologically,&nbsp;he was the first son of his father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,24. לבני גד</span><span class="font5">, “of the members of the tribe of Gad;” the&nbsp;Torah ranks him as third in the list, as he was the firstborn of&nbsp;the maidservants of his mother. (His mother was the&nbsp;maidservant of Leah, who also had produced Yaakov’s&nbsp;firstborn).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.49. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת ראשם לא תשא בתוך בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “and you are not to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">number them as part of the Children of Israel.” The reason was that the criteria for counting the Levites were not the&nbsp;same as the ones applied to the other (12) tribes. The&nbsp;Levites were counted from age thirty days in this portion,&nbsp;(3,14), on the one hand, and again from the age of 30-50 (in&nbsp;chapter 4,47.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: seeing that none of them would serve in the army, but they would only perform duties&nbsp;as security guards for the holy objects, a different yardstick&nbsp;was applied to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.50. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;המה ישאו</span><span class="font5">, “they will carry;” whenever the people&nbsp;broke camp and continued on their journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והמה ישרתוהו</span><span class="font5">, “and they would minister to it;” when the Tabernacle would be put up again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וסביב למשכן יחנו</span><span class="font5">, and they would encamp immediately around the Tabernacle from all sides to ensure that no&nbsp;unauthorized person would enter the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,51. יורידו אותו הלוים, יקימו אותו</span><span class="font5">, “the Levites will dissemble it and will reassemble it;” they will do so by&nbsp;inserting the bolts through the rings in the planks and&nbsp;removing same, as required. This is all considered as part of&nbsp;their ministrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והזר הקרב יומת</span><span class="font5">, “and a common man that comes too near will be executed.” Levites are also considered “common”&nbsp;men in this respect. They may not enter these holy precincts&nbsp;once the Tabernacle had been re-assembled. Assembling or&nbsp;dissembling did not require their entering, and when the&nbsp;Tabernacle had been taken apart, the site it had stood on&nbsp;was no longer considered as a holy site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,53. והלוים יחנו סביב</span><span class="font5">, “and the Levites are to encamp around it.” Their camp was situated between that of the&nbsp;priests and that of the ordinary Israelites. This fact prevented&nbsp;them from approaching too close to it. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B‘chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">והלוים יחנו סביב, when the same statement was made earlier in verse 50, why was the wording different, i.e. וסביב&nbsp;למשכן יחנו, “and around the Tabernacle they are to encamp?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In verse 50 the Torah spoke about carrying the Holy Ark when the people broke camp, something of the highest&nbsp;degree of holiness. Here the Torah only speaks about the&nbsp;Tabernacle which houses the sacred vessels. Its holiness&nbsp;derives from the vessels it houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יהיה קצף</span><span class="font5">, “so that there will not be Divine anger against the community of Israel.” The Torah had already&nbsp;warned of this in verse 51, when spelling out that coming too&nbsp;close was a capital offence and would be punished with&nbsp;execution. (Ibn Ezra) This is precisely what happened in&nbsp;Samuel II 6,7 when Uzza mistakenly, and with noble&nbsp;intentions, touched the Holy Ark in order to steady it and&nbsp;prevent it from falling from the wagon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על עדת בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, against a member of the community of Israel, not against the whole community. We find similar&nbsp;construction in Exodus 21,11: אם שלש אלה לא יעשה לה, which&nbsp;does not mean that the master has not done ail these three&nbsp;procedures for the servant maid, but that he has failed to do&nbsp;even one of them. Compare also: ויקבר בערי הגלעד, “he was&nbsp;buried in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">towns</span><span class="font5"> of Gilead;” (Judges 12,7) The meaning is&nbsp;not that different parts of Yiftach were buried in different&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">towns</span><span class="font5">, but that his remains were buried in one of those&nbsp;towns. Compare also Zecharyah 9,9, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועל עיר בן </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">אתונות</span><span class="font5">, “but&nbsp;riding on a young donkey, born by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">asses</span><span class="font5">.” The meaning is&nbsp;not that this donkey had more than one mother, but “by one&nbsp;of the many she-asses.” (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,54. 'ויעשו בני ישראל ככל אשר צוה וגו</span><span class="font5">, “The Children of Israel did in accordance with all that the Lord had&nbsp;commanded Moses;” why did this Book not mention Aaron&nbsp;thus far? Rabbi Joshua son of Nechemyah quoting Rabbi&nbsp;Chiyah, says that Aaron had been busy establishing his&nbsp;family’s pedigree. The people had said to him that until he&nbsp;could prove the pedigree of Pinchas (his grandson) and to&nbsp;whom his son Elazar was married, (not to a daughter of&nbsp;Putiel, as written in Exodus 6,25, where he is reported as&nbsp;having married one of the daughters of that man, an&nbsp;idolater), he could not be included in the census.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When G’d saw that the people were trying to belittle Aaron, He </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Himself</span><span class="font5"> testified that Pinchas was the son of&nbsp;Elazar who was the son of Aaron the High Priest, (Numbers&nbsp;25,11) one fanatic having sired another fanatic. (Vayikra&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 33,4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[This is a veiled reference to the founding father of the tribe of Levi, having been a fanatic, as is clear from when&nbsp;Levi and his brother Shimon killed all the males in the town of&nbsp;Sh’chem as retribution for the rape of their sister Dinah.&nbsp;(Genesis 34,25-26) Pinchas had inherited part of that DNA&nbsp;when he killed Zimri the prince of Shimon for having&nbsp;cohabited with the Midianite woman Cosbi. (Numbers 25,15)&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation: the verse above is testimony that none of the Israelites ever violated the commandment&nbsp;not to enter the sacred area of the Tabernacle and thus&nbsp;become liable to execution. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,2. על דגלו באותות</span><span class="font5">, “every man with his own standard according to the insignias of his father’s house;” the flags had&nbsp;the names of the (fore)father’s houses inscribed upon them.&nbsp;How did this work? On the flag of Reuven there was an&nbsp;inscription אי׳י, the respective first letters of the names of the&nbsp;patriarchs אברהם, יצחק, יעקב. On the second flag (there were&nbsp;four flags, for each army group of four tribes.) there were&nbsp;inscribed the letters בצ׳ע, the second letter in the names of&nbsp;each of the three patriarchs. The third flag would have the&nbsp;letters רח׳ק representing the third letter in the respective&nbsp;names of Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov, and the fourth flag&nbsp;the letters מק׳ב, representing the last letters each in their&nbsp;names. The letter ה which had been added to Avraham’s&nbsp;name, would be represented by the protective cloud that&nbsp;rested above the Israelites and protected them against nosy&nbsp;intruders during all the years they were in the desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the line: באותות לבית אבותם. The flag of the camp of Reuven had the outline of a human&nbsp;being in red colour, matching the colour of his stone on&nbsp;Aaron’s breastplate. It represented the mandrakes Reuven&nbsp;had found in the field and brought to his mother Leah, which&nbsp;the latter had traded for an extra night with her husband.&nbsp;(Genesis chapter 30) These mandrakes were shaped like a&nbsp;human being. The outline of a lion was drawn or stitched ion&nbsp;the flag of Yehudah, who was called: “lion” in the Torah by&nbsp;his father (Genesis 49,9) The colour of that outline was&nbsp;turquoise as was the colour of his gem on Aaron’s&nbsp;breastplate. The flag of Ephrayim showed the outline of an&nbsp;ox, whom his father Joseph had reputedly called שור, ox,&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 33,17) The colour of that outline was onyx, as&nbsp;was the colour of his gemstone on the breastplate of Aaron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the flag of Dan there was the outline of an eagle, coloured in a variety of colours, iridescent, as the gemstone&nbsp;that represented the tribe of Dan on Aaron’s breastplate. (Ibn&nbsp;Ezra) The Tabernacle located in the centre, was flanked by&nbsp;all these camps, and was a symbol of the holy angels called&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chayot,</span><span class="font5"> which surround the throne of G’d forming a square.</span></p>

The Levites, not having ancestral land, had time&nbsp;therefore to devote themselves to those tasks.</span></p>

When the Levites were appointed to&nbsp;perform the tasks previously meant to be performed by the&nbsp;firstborn, they forfeited their claim to ancestral heritage in the&nbsp;Land of Israel, and the firstborns, after redemption, could&nbsp;then lay claim to ancestral territory as did all the non&nbsp;firstborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,15.מבן חדש ומעלה תפקדם</span><span class="font5">, “you will count them from one month and up.” The reason why they were not counted from&nbsp;twenty years and up is that they would not participate in any&nbsp;wars, and from 30 days of age and up they could be used to&nbsp;redeem firstborns of the other tribes. A first born son of any&nbsp;tribe became viable at the age of 30 days.</span></p>

It is not logical to assume that they&nbsp;possessed the spiritual power to redeem a second time. All&nbsp;the firstborns that are mentioned at this point were not the&nbsp;ones that had been redeemed by Levites in the desert, but&nbsp;had been born by ordinary Israelites who had never been&nbsp;redeemed; the firstborns that had been redeemed by Levites&nbsp;had not been known to also redeem as yet unborn firstborn&nbsp;that stemmed from them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,50. מאת בכור בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “from the firstborn of the Children of Israel;” this refers to the 273 who were in excess&nbsp;of the 22000 firstborns listed earlier.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,5. וכסו בה, </span><span class="font5">“and the shall cover it;” the prefix ב is used in this sense also in Leviticus 8,32: והנותר בבשר ובלחם, “and&nbsp;the surfeit of the flesh and bread;” compare also Leviticus&nbsp;7,36: ביום משחו אותם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">on the day they were anointed (by&nbsp;means of it).

(that&nbsp;flesh was removed daily as opposed to the showbreads. Ibn&nbsp;Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולחם התמיד עליו יהיה</span><span class="font5">, “the continual bread shall remain on it constantly.” How could these showbreads stay upright and&nbsp;not fall down during the journeys? [Our verse is G’d’s&nbsp;assurance that it would.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,14. ונתנו עליו את כליו</span><span class="font5">, “they shall put on it all its vessels.” The pots were not mentioned as they were identical&nbsp;with wicker baskets made of copper which served three&nbsp;different purposes. They were used to transport fire (glowing&nbsp;coal) on to the altar during the journeys in order to fulfill the&nbsp;instruction that there must always be fire on the altar&nbsp;(Leviticus 6,6.) They would also contain ashes and not&nbsp;completely burned up remains of sacrifices to be carried&nbsp;beyond the boundaries of the camp. While service was in&nbsp;progress they were used to throw from the ramp to the&nbsp;ground next to it. They would land with a bang and be picked&nbsp;up by any priest who had heard the bang. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tamid&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">5,5 where all this is explained in great detail)</span></p>

He would carry&nbsp;one type in his right hand and the other in his left hand. He&nbsp;would carry the incense in his lapel, and the חביתים, “the daily&nbsp;offering of the High Priest”, consisting of a meal offering, so&nbsp;called, he would carry on his shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בקדש ובכיליו</span><span class="font5">, “whether belonging to the Sanctuary or its furnishings.” There is a dot above the letter ב in the word&nbsp;בקדש. (In our editions the dot is over the letter ק.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,20. כבלע את הקדש</span><span class="font5">, “as the sacred furnishings were being covered;” the expression: בלע is also found in&nbsp;Lamentations 2,2, i.e. בלע ה' ולא חמל</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“the Lord consumed&nbsp;without pity;” in light of this we may understand it here as&nbsp;meaning that if anyone wanted to feast his eyes by watching&nbsp;the Tabernacle being dissembled he would die while doing&nbsp;so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find that something similar happened to the people in Beyt Shemesh (Samuel I 6,19) [where 57000 men were&nbsp;killed by G’d for having dared to look inside the ark that the&nbsp;Philistines had captured from the Israelite soldiers and&nbsp;returned after it had created havoc among them. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We therefore hear that the Israelites in the desert, every time when the Tabernacle was dissembled prior to the next&nbsp;step in their journey, kept a distance from that area.&nbsp;(Compare verse 5 in our chapter and the whole discussion of&nbsp;what might otherwise be considered trivial detail as it had no&nbsp;historic significance, no portable Temple ever having been&nbsp;constructed again.) [The lesson surely must be, as already&nbsp;hinted at in Exodus chapter 24, where the elite of the people&nbsp;feasted their eyes on what they perceived as a vision of G’d.&nbsp;The Torah pointed out there that G’d took no action against&nbsp;them then as it was such a happy day in the Jewish people’s&nbsp;history. Ed.] The warning in our verse extended even to the&nbsp;people personally charged with the covering of these sacred&nbsp;items.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Nasso</span></h1>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,23. לעבוד</span><span class="font5">, “to perform service;” their service consisted&nbsp;of erecting and dismantling the Tabernacle, as is written:&nbsp;יורידו אותו הלוים יקימו אותו הלוים, “the Levites are to erect it, the&nbsp;Levites are to dismantle it.” (Numbers 1,51)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועל המזבח סביב ואת מיתריהם</span><span class="font5">, “and by the altar&nbsp;around and their cords;” why were the pegs for the hangings&nbsp;of the courtyard not mentioned here?

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת כל אשר יעשה בהם, </span><span class="font5">“and whatever was to be done with them;” we find this type of construction also Genesis 39,22.&nbsp;in connection with Joseph’s duties in the house of Potiphar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ופקדתם עליהם במשמרת</span><span class="font5">, “you shall appoint their&nbsp;entire burden as their charge.” This is an instruction that we&nbsp;do not find in connection with the duties of the house of&nbsp;Kehat. The reason is that everything that the Kehatites&nbsp;carried was covered and not visible to anyone else, as we&nbsp;have read in 4,15: וכלה אהרן ובניו לכסות את הקדש ואת כל כלי&nbsp;הקדש בנסוע המחנה ואחרי כן יבואו בני קהת, “and when Aaron and&nbsp;his sons had completed to cover the holy furnishings and the&nbsp;holy vessels when the camp was ready to move.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישלחו מן המחנה</span><span class="font5">, “that they shall put outside the&nbsp;encampment, etc.” we have heard the commandment; where&nbsp;do we find the penalty for disregarding this commandment?&nbsp;Answer: this is to be found in Numbers 19,20: ואיש אשר יטמא&nbsp;ולא יתחטא וגו' ״, “and anyone who has become ritually defiled&nbsp;and does not purify himself, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל צרוע וכל זב וכל טמא לנפש</span><span class="font5">, “anyone who has a leprous-like eczema, or a semen related issue, or has been contaminated through contact with a dead body, etc.;” there&nbsp;are three different categories of ritual defilement and we&nbsp;have three verses dealing with them. The common&nbsp;denominator of these three categories of ritual defilement is&nbsp;that the process of purification takes seven days. They also&nbsp;require that the person afflicted with any of these defilements&nbsp;be banned from one or possibly all three camps of the&nbsp;Israelites. This is in contrast with a ritual defilement caused&nbsp;by seminal emission not caused by a disease, which can be&nbsp;purified by immersion in a ritual bath on the same day, so&nbsp;that by nightfall the afflicted person is ritually clean again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מזכר עד נקבה תשלחו</span><span class="font5">, “be such a person male or&nbsp;female he or she must be removed from the camps forbidden&nbsp;for their category of defilement.” The verse teaches that in&nbsp;respect of ritual defilement the Torah does not make a&nbsp;distinction between minors and adults, males or females.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יטמאו את מחניהם, </span><span class="font5">“in order that their presence while in such a state does not confer ritual impurity on the entire&nbsp;camp.” They must also undergo a purification process for&nbsp;having committed robbery, or possibly indulged in forbidden&nbsp;sexual relations. Also a Nazarite who is in doubt about&nbsp;having violated the terms of his vow must undergo&nbsp;purification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,4. ויעשו כן בני ישראל, וישלחו</span><span class="font5">, “the Children of Israel did so, and they put outside, etc.” from the manner in which this&nbsp;is reported it is clear that this commandment was meant to&nbsp;be fulfilled without any delay</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כן עשו בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “the Israelites did so;” the apparent repetition indicates that the people affected by this did not&nbsp;object or argue about their status.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי יעשו מכל חטאת האדם</span><span class="font5">, “if they will commit any sin&nbsp;that people are in the habit of committing;” this paragraph&nbsp;concerns theft committed against the estate of a convert; the&nbsp;Rabbis derive this from the words 'מעל בה, “a trespass against&nbsp;the Lord;” seeing that the convert left behind no heirs, the&nbsp;thief or robber considered what he did as finder’s keeper.&nbsp;The Torah teaches that this is not so, but that the Lord is the&nbsp;One Who considers Himself as having been sinned against&nbsp;in this instance. A similar paragraph in Leviticus 5,21 has the&nbsp;words: וכחש בעמיתו, “and he denies having trespassed&nbsp;against his colleague,” as speaking of a natural born Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why this paragraph follows that of the various types of ritual defilement is to remind us that this very&nbsp;defilement and the subsequent ostracism for at least seven&nbsp;days was a punishment for a trespass committed. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואשמה הנפש ההיא, והתודו</span><span class="font5">, ”and that soul shall be guilty, and confess;” Rabbi Natan claims that this is a line that can&nbsp;be used universally for all such trespasses, that the first step&nbsp;in rehabilitation of the sinner must be his confession of&nbsp;having committed this trespass. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וחמישתו יוסיף עליו, </span><span class="font5">“and he is to add a fifth of it” (the&nbsp;value of the stolen property); if his confession is not the result&nbsp;of witnesses having accused him of his guilt, but it is simply&nbsp;an expression of his remorse, then he does not have to pay&nbsp;this extra 25% which was meant as a penalty. We have&nbsp;already explained in our commentary on Leviticus 5,16&nbsp;precisely what is meant by the word .</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחמישתו</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתן לאשר אשם לו</span><span class="font5">, “he will give to the person against whom he trespassed etc.” this verse teaches that if someone&nbsp;had owed a certain person, Reuven, say 100 dollars, and he&nbsp;came to the court with the intent to pay Reuven that amount,&nbsp;but did not arrive until another creditor of Reuven had lodged&nbsp;a claim regarding an independent amount owed him by&nbsp;Reuven, the court will accept payment from the debtor and&nbsp;transfer it to the creditor, as the Torah specifically writes: “he&nbsp;will give it to the one against whom he had sinned by not&nbsp;paying it sooner.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Malbim</span><span class="font5"> adds certain qualifications to the example quoted by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri.</span><span class="font5"> Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,8. 'המושב לה</span><span class="font5">, “it shall be viewed as returned to the&nbsp;Lord,” through being given to a priest who is the&nbsp;representative of G’d on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לה' לכהן</span><span class="font5">, G’d is considered the Father of all converts and as such entitled to inherit him. It (the outstanding debt) will&nbsp;therefore be paid to G’d’s “heir” on earth, the priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,10. ואיש את קדשיו לו יהיה</span><span class="font5">, “and every man’s hallowed things shall be his;” this somewhat enigmatic phrase,&nbsp;teaches that if a priest has sanctified some of his animals as&nbsp;sacrifices, he need not hand them over to the group of&nbsp;priests on duty at the time, but can proceed to offer such&nbsp;animals personally, although this particular time is not one&nbsp;during which he is on duty. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איש אשר יתן לכהן לו יהיה</span><span class="font5">, “whatsoever any man gives (prematurely) to a priest shall be (remain) his, the donor’s.”&nbsp;This verse or phrase, is understood to mean that if a father of&nbsp;a firstborn son had given a priest the money for his son’s&nbsp;redemption before said son was thirty days old, and in the&nbsp;interval that son had died before reaching the age of thirty&nbsp;days, (when it had become due) the priest is to return the&nbsp;money he has received to the deceased son’s father. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תשטה אשתו</span><span class="font5">, “any man whose wife goes astray;”&nbsp;the reason the following paragraph appears at this junction is&nbsp;that both paragraphs discuss the kind of trespass called&nbsp;מעילה by the Torah. (Compare verse 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונסתרה והיא נטמאה</span><span class="font5">, “and the fact that she had&nbsp;become defiled by having sexual relations with a man not her&nbsp;husband was concealed from him;” according to our Rabbis,&nbsp;this verse teaches that when there is a doubt about whether&nbsp;an object reposing in private property is ritually clean, the&nbsp;doubt is treated as if certainty of it being ritually </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">unclean</span><span class="font5"> as&nbsp;doubt of this nature is by definition only possible in a privately&nbsp;owned property that the public has no access to. The Torah&nbsp;here describes the doubt about the woman’s actions as if&nbsp;fact, and she lost her previous status of being assumed to be&nbsp;ritually pure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיא נטמאה </span><span class="font5">“and she had become ritually defiled;” through the semen of the man she had carnal relations with;”&nbsp;the word והיא here is spelled with letter י. [The Torah&nbsp;emphasized her impurity, ignoring her partner’s. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועד אין בה</span><span class="font5">, “and there is no witness who could accuse her of infidelity;” the reason why there is no witness is&nbsp;because she had not been raped. (according to Rabbi&nbsp;Saadyah gaon, as well as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam)</span><span class="font5"> (This could have&nbsp;served as a defense.) Because there is a doubt about her&nbsp;conduct, she has to undergo an examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועד אין בה</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this phrase that we must contrast it with what the law would be if there </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">had</span><span class="font5"> been a&nbsp;witness testifying against her. Even the testimony of a single&nbsp;witness would be enough not to let her drink the potentially&nbsp;disastrous waters. The line also means that whereas we do&nbsp;not have a witness that she had carnal relations with a man&nbsp;not her husband, we do have witnesses that she had hidden&nbsp;herself, so that she could have committed that sin easily. The&nbsp;grammatical construction here is similar to Leviticus 24,14:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורגמו אותו</span><span class="font5">, “they will (all) stone him;” the extra word אותו&nbsp;instead of the pronoun ending, i.e. ורגמוהו, teaches that he&nbsp;will be stoned naked, his clothing will not be stoned. Here,&nbsp;the word אותה means the reverse, i.e. while she was clothed.&nbsp;(Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 45). There are numerous examples&nbsp;of such constructions in the Torah and the reason why extra&nbsp;letters were used to teach us certain </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachot,</span><span class="font5"> legal rulings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word אפילו, “even,” in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary here, is clearly a printer’s error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sota,</span><span class="font5"> folio 3 has Rabbi Yishmael raise the question why in the case of this woman&nbsp;suspected of marital infidelity, the Torah chose to accept the&nbsp;testimony of a single witness at all? In answer it is suggested&nbsp;that there is some logic for such a procedure. This was a&nbsp;case where the husband had legitimate reason to suspect his&nbsp;wife of immoral conduct, and he had warned her not be alone&nbsp;with the person whom he suspects her of being too friendly&nbsp;with. His suspicions had been aroused because she had&nbsp;already once contravened his warnings and had been known&nbsp;to have been alone with the man in question </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> that&nbsp;warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover we have a statement in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ketuvot</span><span class="font5"> folio 9, according to which: a woman (wife) is not&nbsp;forbidden for a husband to continue to have marital relations&nbsp;with on the basis of the testimony of a single witness, until&nbsp;we have two valid witnesses that can accuse her of having&nbsp;been unfaithful to her husband, and her husband had already&nbsp;been jealous of her and she had subsequently secluded&nbsp;herself with the man against whom her husband had warned&nbsp;her not to seclude herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In commenting on this statement in the Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">writes that the Talmud cites an example when there was no&nbsp;witness at all that accused her of having had carnal relations,&nbsp;but that there had been witnesses to the husband expressing&nbsp;his jealousy, and her secreting herself with the man in&nbsp;question nonetheless. If however, there was one witness&nbsp;accusing her of additional seclusion, after all this, such a&nbsp;witness is sufficient. He bases himself on the word: בה,&nbsp;”against her,” in our verse. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> opinion that word refers&nbsp;to testimony of carnal union, [although there had not been&nbsp;two witnesses. Ed.] We read the line as if it had said; “there&nbsp;were no two witnesses against her but only one.” In other&nbsp;words, the extent of the value of this one witness is for the&nbsp;accused woman not to have to drink the bitter waters in order&nbsp;to prove her innocence and the consequences if she had&nbsp;lied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיא לא נתפשה</span><span class="font5">, “she had not been caught in the act.” [alternate meaning of the word נתפשה.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.14.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“she had not been defiled;” the word והיא is&nbsp;spelled with the letter י.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והביא את קרבנה</span><span class="font5">, “he will offer her sacrifice;” it is&nbsp;impossible to assume that this offering will bring her</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">atonement, as we have a principle that offerings by confirmed sinners are an abomination. (Proverbs 21,27)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What happens here is that the person who had observed the adulterous action originally, without reacting to&nbsp;it and bringing it to the attention of the appropriate&nbsp;authorities, brings an offering, in order to atone for his sin of&nbsp;omission. By having failed to do so, he was now the cause of&nbsp;the Holy Name of the Lord becoming dissolved in the waters&nbsp;that the woman denying the accusation is made to drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קמח שעורים, </span><span class="font5">“of barley flour.” This is a type of flour in which also the husks are mixed in with the kernels. This&nbsp;reflects on the nature of the sin it is to atone for, as it&nbsp;resembles fodder for animals, and the guilty party acted like&nbsp;an animal in its indiscriminate conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא יצוק עליו שמן ולא יתן עליו לבונה</span><span class="font5">, “he shall pour no oil on it, nor is he to put frankincense thereon.” Those ingredients&nbsp;when added to other gift offerings are usually referred to as&nbsp;אזכרה, “remembrance,” as they are to remind the recipient of&nbsp;the offering, the Lord, of the person who has presented it. In&nbsp;this instance it would remind Him of the guilt of the donor of&nbsp;this offering, seeing it is known as a מנחת קנאות, “a meal&nbsp;offering of jealousy,” i.e. instead of pleasant fragrance it&nbsp;exudes only the spirit of jealousy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מזכרת עון</span><span class="font5">, it reminds G’d of the guilt of either of the two parties concerned, either the woman who had sinned or her&nbsp;husband who had suspected her unfairly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי מנחת קנאות הוא, </span><span class="font5">“for it is a meal offering originating from jealousy.” The word הוא, seeing that it is in the&nbsp;masculine mode, refers to the earlier noun קמח, which is a&nbsp;masculine noun. In verse 18, where the expression מנחת&nbsp;קנאות הוא occurs again, it refers to the offering which is from&nbsp;the noun מנחה, a feminine noun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,16. והעמידה, </span><span class="font5">“he shall position her;” this means that&nbsp;she will be placed in a position from which she cannot&nbsp;escape. Compare Joshua 10,13: ויעמד השמש בחצי השמים, “the&nbsp;sun stood still when it was at its zenith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'והעמידה לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “he sets her before the Lord.” He said to her: ‘wait here for me until I enter the Temple and return in&nbsp;order to take some earth from there.’ She was not allowed to&nbsp;enter the Temple (in order to save the priest time and effort.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,17. ומן העפר אשר יהיה בקרקע המשכן</span><span class="font5">, “and from the soil on the floor of the Tabernacle, etc.” we have learned in a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 15, that the priest when&nbsp;entering the Sanctuary would turn to his right, and that close&nbsp;by there was a spot one cubit by one cubit, to which a slab of&nbsp;marble would be permanently attached by means of rings,&nbsp;from which the priest by lifting that slab would take the earth&nbsp;to be mixed with the water that this woman would be made to&nbsp;drink from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ממי המרים</span><span class="font5">, “from this water of bitterness;”&nbsp;according to our sages, the priest had added herbs that&nbsp;would make the water taste bitter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת כי שטית</span><span class="font5">, “but since you have strayed, etc.” the&nbsp;priest did not say to her: “if you have strayed,” but he said to&nbsp;her that there was no question that she had strayed, the&nbsp;question was only to what extent she had strayed. She&nbsp;definitely deserved to have been shamed. Having caused her&nbsp;husband to suspect her, and having subsequently secreted&nbsp;herself with a man that her husband had specifically told her&nbsp;not to do, was disgraceful behaviour, even if no intimacy had&nbsp;occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכי נטמאת</span><span class="font5">, “the priest left the end of the sentence unsaid, i.e. “you will be punished through drinking these waters.” And&nbsp;in the event you have become ritually defiled;” he also&nbsp;implied that if she had not had carnal relations with someone&nbsp;other than her husband the waters would not harm her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מבלעדי אישך</span><span class="font5">, the wording means that only if she had engaged in carnal relations with another man after her&nbsp;husband had been her husband in the full sense of the word,&nbsp;not during the period when she was merely betrothed, would&nbsp;she be forced to drink these waters if she wanted to clear her&nbsp;name. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">5.21.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והשביע הכהן את האשה</span><span class="font5">, “then the priest shall cause&nbsp;the woman to accept a curse as a form of an oath;” this took&nbsp;the form of the woman confirming the curses uttered by the&nbsp;priest with answering: “Amen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ירכך</span><span class="font5">, “your thigh;” this is a synonym for “your womb.” Compare Genesis 24,2 where Avraham asks his servant to&nbsp;select a suitable wife for his son Yitzchok, by placing his&nbsp;hand under his thigh, i.e. תחת ירכי; then we have the&nbsp;expression: יוצאי ירך יעקב, “the descendants of Yaakov&nbsp;stemming from his thigh,” in Exodus 1,5. In the Talmud&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah,</span><span class="font5"> folio 13, we hear that a woman’s jealousy is usually&nbsp;concerned with the offspring of other women, where the word&nbsp;for “offspring” used is the word .ירך</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נופלת</span><span class="font5">, “falling,” an expression describing the loss of something. Compare Job 12,3: לא נופל אנכי מכם, “I am no less&nbsp;than you.” Applied to our situation this means: “you are no&nbsp;longer capable of engaging in carnal relations as the waters&nbsp;will damage the organs designed for this. Your womb will be&nbsp;ruined.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,22. ואמרה האשה: אמן</span><span class="font5">, “the woman will respond by saying: “Amen.” In other words, she will agree that this will&nbsp;happen to her and deservedly, if she lied and was guilty of&nbsp;the accusations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the Jerusalem Targum, the word “Amen” here includes the following: “I agree that if I have defiled&nbsp;myself, or even if I will defile myself in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to our sages in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri,</span><span class="font5"> the word: “Amen” here, means that she agrees that if she was guilty of having&nbsp;carnal relations with the particular man under discussion, or&nbsp;even with any </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">other</span><span class="font5"> man not under discussion (after her&nbsp;marriage) she agrees that she deserves the penalty&nbsp;announced to her by the priest (the Torah).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They explain further that seeing that the oaths are expressed in the plural mode, although only one single&nbsp;example of what they applied to was mentioned, (carnal&nbsp;relations (verse 20) any earlier violations of the laws of&nbsp;chastity in marriage would </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">also</span><span class="font5"> now result in her being&nbsp;punished for them. They use logic to derive this: if a woman&nbsp;who had strayed but had never been accused previously is&nbsp;now being punished, any earlier acts of robbery [marital&nbsp;infidelity is an act of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">robbing</span><span class="font5"> one’s husband of his legitimate&nbsp;and exclusive rights, Ed.] in which the accusation could not&nbsp;be made to result in her being penalized, would now also be&nbsp;taken into consideration by G’d and used against her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכתב, </span><span class="font5">“he will write;” using ink dissoluble in water.&nbsp;This is clear from the word: ומחה, ”he will erase;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את האלות האלה</span><span class="font5">, “these curses;” the ones recorded on the scrolls mentioned here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והשקה את האשה</span><span class="font5">, “he shall make the woman drink;”&nbsp;the letter ה at the end of the word האשה, does not have a dot&nbsp;in it, as opposed to the same word in verse 27, where that&nbsp;dot is a pronoun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונפלה ירכה</span><span class="font5">, “and her womb will fall;” it will no longer&nbsp;be able to fulfill the functions for which it had been designed.&nbsp;The punishment matches the crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונקתה</span><span class="font5">, “she will be cleared” (of the accusation).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונזרעה זרע</span><span class="font5">, “and will conceive seed.” Her womb will not</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">have suffered damage, and in future marital relations with her husband she will conceive [and presumably give&nbsp;successful birth. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the last two words in our verse. From this point on when her husband resumes marital&nbsp;relations with her he will do so with halachic permission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,31. ונקה האיש מעון, </span><span class="font5">“and the man will be free from guilt,” the guilt of allowing his wife to indulge in infidelity while&nbsp;married to her without divorcing her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את עונה</span><span class="font5">, “her guilt.” The meaning of the word: עון here is the same as the same word in Samuel I 28,10: אם יקרך עון&nbsp;בדבר הזה, “if in this matter you would become guilty of&nbsp;something, etc.;” King Saul absolves the witch of Endor in&nbsp;advance of her complying with his request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once the moral standards of the Jewish people had declined so that the incidence of infidelity, adultery, was no&nbsp;longer a rare event, the practice of subjecting women&nbsp;accused of such to Divine intervention in order drink the bitter&nbsp;waters to clear her name was discontinued. This&nbsp;discontinuation was based on when the prophet Hoseah,&nbsp;4,14 wrote (quoting G’d) לא אפקוד על בנותיכם כי תזנינה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“I will&nbsp;not punish your daughters </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">engaging in adultery.” The&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum</span><span class="font5"> on this line translates the words לא אפקוד, as if the&nbsp;prophet had said: לא אבדוק, “I will not examine if the&nbsp;accusation is justified” by letting My Holy Name be dissolved&nbsp;in water.) (Compare Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah,</span><span class="font5"> folio 47).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,2. כי יפלא, </span><span class="font5">this is one of the words which occur in different contexts, having opposite meanings, such as&nbsp;“building” or “demolishing.” For instance, we find the phrase&nbsp;(Deut. 17,8) כי יפלא ממך דבר, where it means: “if something is&nbsp;too baffling for you, etc;” (the reference is to litigation&nbsp;between two parties)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In our situation, our sages presume that the subject of the vow of Nazirite was not inserted here haphazardly, but&nbsp;that it teaches a valuable lesson in how to preserve one’s&nbsp;sin-free status. Our sages surmise that the reason that this&nbsp;subject follows on the heels of that of the wayward wife, is&nbsp;that man falling victim to sinning is related to imbibing too&nbsp;much wine or alcoholic drink, something that loosens not&nbsp;only one’s tongue, but also other restraints that would have&nbsp;served as protection against committing certain sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[The reader may recall that Lot having been given too much wine by his daughters, resulted in the first instance of&nbsp;incest, so that the founder of the people of Moav’s founding&nbsp;father was at the same time also his grandfather through his&nbsp;mother. Eventually, 24000 Israelites were killed by a plague&nbsp;for having made an obeisance to a Moabite idol, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baal-Peor,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">after having drunk too much wine and slept with Moabite&nbsp;women who had been told by Bileam to find a way to seduce&nbsp;them. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to our author, a woman who has not coiffed her hair properly is not in demand for sexual intercourse.&nbsp;(Based on Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נדר נדר להזיר, </span><span class="font5">“has uttered a vow to become a Nazirite.” The reason why the Torah chose such a cumbersome way of&nbsp;saying this is that it wanted to incorporate the three main&nbsp;aspects of the Nazirite’s vow: abstention from wine, etc; not&nbsp;shaving his hair, and avoiding contact with ritual impurity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,5. גדל פרע</span><span class="font5">, “the locks (of hair) growing wildly;” these&nbsp;are two words meaning almost the same, just as in Daniel&nbsp;12,2: אדמת עפר</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">dusty earth</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על נפש מת</span><span class="font5">, “near a dead body;” the word על is used&nbsp;in the sense of אצל, “next to.” Examples of such uses are&nbsp;found in Exodus 40,3: וסכות על הארון את הפרוכת, “you shall&nbsp;screen the Ark with the veil next to it.” Compare also Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">24,30,והוא עומד על הגמלים, “while he was standing next to the camels.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.7. לא יטמא להם</span><span class="font5">, “he must not defile himself on their account.” The addition of the word: להם on </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">their</span><span class="font5"> account,&nbsp;means that he may or even should defile himself in order to&nbsp;bury a corpse who has no one else to attend to his being&nbsp;buried. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah</span><span class="font5"> folio 3.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במותם</span><span class="font5">, “on account of their death;” however, he is not forbidden to become defiled through contact with living&nbsp;human beings afflicted with involuntary emissions from their&nbsp;sexual organs. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span><span class="font5"> [How could he be aware of their&nbsp;condition?

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכי ימות מת עליו</span><span class="font5">, “and if someone dies suddenly&nbsp;beside him;” here the meaning of the word עליו is not “on&nbsp;him,” or “upon him,” but “beside him, next to him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בפתע פתאום</span><span class="font5">, “very suddenly;” a construction similar to גדל פרע in verse 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטמא ראש נזרו</span><span class="font5">, “and he will defile his consecrated head;” this expression means that he has invalidated all the days of&nbsp;his being a Nazirite until now, and has to start the count&nbsp;anew.” The reason is that those days have to be counted&nbsp;consecutively, [generally the vow is valid for 30 days unless&nbsp;specified differently at the outset. Ed.] Any interruption of his&nbsp;status through ritual defilement cancels the whole period&nbsp;preceding it. [The word ראש in connection with counting has&nbsp;appeared repeatedly when the Israelites underwent a&nbsp;census. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שתי תורים</span><span class="font5">, “two turtle doves;” these plus a male&nbsp;sheep below the age of one year (verse 12) i.e. three&nbsp;animals symbolising the three major aspects of being a&nbsp;Nazirite, abstention from alcoholic drink, letting his hair grow&nbsp;wild, and avoiding contact with dead bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,11. מאשר חטא על הנפש</span><span class="font5">, “for having sinned by reason of the dead.” (He should have made sure that the building he&nbsp;entered did not contain a corpse) The Torah had specifically&nbsp;warned him not to enter such a building in verse 6 of our&nbsp;chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזאת תורת הנזיר</span><span class="font5">, “and this is the law of the Nazirite”&nbsp;up to now the Torah had dealt with problems a Nazirite&nbsp;encounters when he violated the terms of his vow; now it&nbsp;proceeds to inform us about the procedures he must follows&nbsp;upon successful completion of the terms of his vow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.14</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כבש אחד, כבשה אחת, ואיל אחד</span><span class="font5">, “one male sheep, one&nbsp;female sheep, and one ram;” the three animals represent the&nbsp;three major aspects of a Nazirite’s vow, i.e. to abstain from&nbsp;any grape-based drink, including any part of the untreated&nbsp;fruit; to let the hair of his head grow without trimming any of&nbsp;it; to avoid contact with dead bodies which would defile his&nbsp;ritual purity. In order to underline this symbolism even further,&nbsp;there are three stages concerning how the parts of the ram&nbsp;which serves as a “peace-offering” and that are not burned&nbsp;up on the altar are to be consumed. One part is to be&nbsp;“consumed” by the altar; one part is to be consumed by the&nbsp;priest or priests on duty at that time; and the third part by the&nbsp;owner and his family, i.e. the Nazirite himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואיל אחד תמים שלמים</span><span class="font5">, this last offering reflects the Nazirite’s joy at having been able to complete term of his vow&nbsp;successfully. Prior to offering this ram, the Nazirite must&nbsp;place his body weight on the animal as a gesture of&nbsp;dedicating it as a sacrifice, and the parts assigned to the&nbsp;priest or priests, must undergo the customary waving. These&nbsp;parts are to be given to the priests while still raw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,18. וגלח הנזיר</span><span class="font5">, “and he shall shave of the hair of his head; from what we have read earlier in verse 5, we knew&nbsp;that this “shaving” is performed by a razor. Seeing that Jews&nbsp;are forbidden to shave by razor, this hair now has to be&nbsp;burned, so that none of it can be used or enjoyed as the&nbsp;proceeds of a sin must not be enjoyed. If it were not burned,&nbsp;innocent people not aware of its origin might use it for their&nbsp;own benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתן על האש, </span><span class="font5">“and place it on the fire;” because it has been sanctified, as stated in verse 5 above. This is why it&nbsp;was fit for burning so as not to become an unwitting obstacle&nbsp;to people not knowing its origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר תחת זבח השלמים</span><span class="font5">, “which is under the peace offering.” Seeing that it is holy, it needs to be burned under the pot in&nbsp;which the meat of that offering is being boiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הזרוע</span><span class="font5">, “the shoulder;” the word זרוע is a feminine&nbsp;noun as we know from Exodus 6,6: זרוע נטויה, “an&nbsp;outstretched arm.” This is why, when describing its adjective,&nbsp;the Torah wrote: בשלה, and not מבושל. Compare the words:&nbsp;כבידה, heavy, or שמנה, fat, or אבילה, in a state of mourning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על חזה התנופה ועל שוק התרומה</span><span class="font5">, “together with breast&nbsp;of waving and the thigh of heaving;” in other words: together&nbsp;with the breast and the thigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על נזרו</span><span class="font5">, “on account of the vow which he shall&nbsp;pledge.” Compare this construction with: Leviticus 1,4: לכפר&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">עליו</span><span class="font5">, “to be acceptable to atone for him.” Compare also&nbsp;Psalms 44,23: כי 2ל2ב הורגנו, “since for Your sake we have&nbsp;been killed, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">מלבד</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> אשר תשיג ידו</span><span class="font5">, “beside that which he can afford.” This is also a construction which we find elsewhere, as for&nbsp;instance in Leviticus 23,38: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">מלבד</span><span class="font5"> מתנותיכם, “beside your gifts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,23. דבר אל אהרן, </span><span class="font5">“speak to Aaron, etc.;” the reason why&nbsp;the paragraph dealing with the priestly blessing has been&nbsp;inserted at this juncture, is that they are holy, just as the&nbsp;Nazirite was holy, though only for a limited period, and not&nbsp;from birth. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואל בניו</span><span class="font5">, “and to his sons;” this teaches that not only the High Priest bestows blessings on the people but also the&nbsp;ordinary priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כה תברכו</span><span class="font5">, “thus you shall bless:” during the first year while Jewish people were encamped in the same spot&nbsp;(around Mount Sinai) the Canaanites did not become aware&nbsp;of them. But during the second year when they had been&nbsp;counted according to tribes, and each knew his family tree,&nbsp;and they had been assigned flags, trumpets, etc., in order to&nbsp;organise their journeys properly, the Canaanites surrounding&nbsp;them had taken note of them. At this point the Canaanites&nbsp;had first begun to fear the approaching armies of the&nbsp;Israelites, [though they were not really an army as they&nbsp;travelled with their whole families. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Israelites, aware of the likelihood of military encounters in the near future, now felt in need of blessings&nbsp;by the priests. They worried of being guilty of sins that would&nbsp;make them casualties in the coming confrontation. The fact is&nbsp;that immediately after the death of Aaron, when the&nbsp;Canaanites felt encouraged to attack them, they captured&nbsp;some prisoners. (Numbers 21,1) [Seeing that encounter&nbsp;happened to the next generation after almost 40 years, it is&nbsp;hard to see the relevance at this point. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כה תברכו</span><span class="font5">, “thus you shall bless!” You are to be in a standing position when conferring these blessings.” This is&nbsp;spelled out more clearly in Deuteronomy 27,12: אלה </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">יעמדו</span><span class="font5">&nbsp;לברך, “these are to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">stand</span><span class="font5"> in order to pronounce blessing!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אמור להם</span><span class="font5">, “say to them!” this teaches that the reader in the synagogue has to call upon the priests to begin their&nbsp;blessings. This also teaches that the priest is not guilty of&nbsp;failing to carry out this commandment until he has failed to&nbsp;respond to the reader’s call to do so. [He can leave the&nbsp;Sanctuary prior to this. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יאר ה׳ פניו</span><span class="font5">, “May the Lord make His face shine;”&nbsp;The meaning is that the priest expresses the wish that G’d&nbsp;will grant the listeners life, as per Proverbs 16,15: באור פני מלך&nbsp;חיים, “in the light of the King’s face there is life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ישא ה׳ פניו אליך</span><span class="font5">, “may the Lord lift up His&nbsp;countenance upon you!” In order to understand this properly&nbsp;it will help to look at Samuel II 2,22: ואיך אשא פני אל יואב אחיך</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5">how will I be able to look your brother Yoav in the face?&nbsp;[Avner had been trying to save Asa-el, his pursuer’s life, and&nbsp;Yoav’s brother by begging him to take advantage of the&nbsp;opportunity to escape from him. Ed.] The priests, in their&nbsp;blessing, ask G’d to welcome the members of the&nbsp;congregation with a welcoming and joyful heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning Deuteronomy 10,17: אשר לא ישא פנים, “Who does not show favour anyone,” which at first glance appears&nbsp;to invalidate the priest’s blessing, the true meaning of the line&nbsp;is that G’d is not flattering anyone when delaying punishment&nbsp;for sins he has committed. Compare Kings II 3,14: לולי פני&nbsp;יהושפט אני נושא, “were it not that I respect the King&nbsp;Yehoshaphat of Yehudah, I would not even look at you (King&nbsp;Yehoram of Israel, (ten tribes)”.[What may sometimes appear&nbsp;as if G’d was playing favorites, is due to the circumstances&nbsp;surrounding particular events, when innocent people would&nbsp;suffer if He did not do so. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,26. ושמו את שמי</span><span class="font5">, “they (the priests during their blessing) are to place My name, etc.;” the fact that in each of&nbsp;the verses comprising the priests” blessings they pronounce&nbsp;the most holy name of the Lord, makes plain that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> only&nbsp;act as conduits, and that the blessing stems directly from the&nbsp;Lord. The Torah, in order to underline this concept, adds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואני אברכם</span><span class="font5">, “and I will bless them.” G’d will bless the Israelites in response to the priests invoking this blessing.&nbsp;The priests are never to take credit for having blessed the&nbsp;people, as the blessing stems from the Lord whose&nbsp;messengers they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[There are commentators who understand the above words to mean that if and when the priests bless the people&nbsp;as prescribed, G’d, in turn will bless them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi).</span><span class="font5"> Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,1. ויהי ביום כלות משה להקים את המשכן</span><span class="font5">, “it was on the day</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">that Moses had completed erecting the Tabernacle;” the Torah here refers to chapter 4,1-16. The Torah there had&nbsp;discussed the tasks allocated to the sons of Kehat which&nbsp;needed to be performed by carrying the furnishings on their&nbsp;shoulders. Now it turns to discussing the tasks of the sons of&nbsp;Gershon and Merari, which could not be performed by&nbsp;carrying on their shoulders, and which needed to be&nbsp;transported on the wagons donated by the princes. The&nbsp;subject of consecrating the altar follows that of the priests, to&nbsp;teach that on the day that Aaron raised his hands in blessing&nbsp;the Jewish nation, this was followed immediately by the&nbsp;consecration of the altar. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וימשח אותו</span><span class="font5">, “and he had anointed it;” having done so it became holy, i.e. ויקדש אותו. Our sages in the Talmud</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’vuot,</span><span class="font5"> folio 15 state that all the vessels which Moses anointed became holy through the act of having -been&nbsp;anointed. They were ready for immediate use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקריבו נשיאי ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “the princes of the house of&nbsp;Israel offered etc.;” the Torah follows up with telling us what it&nbsp;was that the princes of the house of Israel offered, i.e. the&nbsp;offering was individual and collective at one and the same&nbsp;time; (verse 3) [Their sacrifices (pl.) are described as קרבנם,&nbsp;“their offering” (singular) instead of קרבנותיהם, “their offerings,&nbsp;pl.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">העומדים על הפקודים</span><span class="font5">, “the ones who supervised the census.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> each prince had stood beside&nbsp;Moses and Aaron when the members of that prince’s tribe&nbsp;were being counted. He based himself on Numbers 1,4:&nbsp;ואתכם יהיו איש איש למטה איש ראש לבית אבותיו הוא, “and with you&nbsp;there shall be a man of every tribe, everyone head of his&nbsp;father’s house.” Therefore the construction of ויביאו את קרבנם,&nbsp;“they brought their atonement offering for counting the&nbsp;people of Israel,” is justified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find another example of such an offering as atonement for counting in Numbers 31,50 after the&nbsp;successful punitive campaign against Midian, [both the&nbsp;soldiers who found that there had been no casualties, and&nbsp;the huge amount of booty collected. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שש עגלות צב</span><span class="font5">, “six covered wagons;” the expression&nbsp;צב, is derived from צבא, “army,” in the sense of mobilising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,5. ונתתה אותם אל הלוים איש כפי עבודתו, “</span><span class="font5">you (Moses) will&nbsp;hand them over to the Levites, each in accordance with the&nbsp;needs of their specific tasks.” This left open the construction&nbsp;of additional wagons if the ones donated by the princes&nbsp;should prove insufficient. It is hardly likely that twelve oxen&nbsp;could pull the 48 sections of the Tabernacle’s walls, plus the&nbsp;one hundred sockets of silver each very heavy, plus all the&nbsp;pillars and the heavy skins and carpets making up the roof of&nbsp;the Tabernacle, not to mention the curtains and supports&nbsp;surrounding the courtyard of the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את שתי העגלות</span><span class="font5">, “the two wagons, etc.” seeing that&nbsp;the weight of the curtains and skins for the roof, and other&nbsp;incidentals, were relatively light, only two of the wagons were&nbsp;assigned for that task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת ארבעת העגלות </span><span class="font5">“and the other four wagons, etc.;”&nbsp;these four wagons would transport all the heavy parts of the&nbsp;Tabernacle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נשיא אחד ליו</span><span class="font5">ם, “one prince each day, etc.” the&nbsp;presentation of these offerings were spread over 12 days in&nbsp;order to accord honour to each of the princes. Seeing that&nbsp;the tribe of Yehudah represented Royalty in the future, the&nbsp;prince of Yehudah, Nachshon, was the fist one to present his&nbsp;offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to ensure that he would not say that seeing he had been the first one to present his offering, he would also&nbsp;join the other princes on each in their offering, the Torah&nbsp;limits the number of offerings to be presented to one on each&nbsp;day. By extending the period of these offerings for 12 days,&nbsp;the festive nature and the attending joy among the people&nbsp;was considerably enhanced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נחשון בן עמינדב</span><span class="font5">, “Nachshon, son of Aminadav.” He&nbsp;has not been accorded his title here as have all the other&nbsp;princes, i.e. “prince of such and such a tribe,” in order that he&nbsp;should not feel proud for having been chosen to be the first&nbsp;one to offer this sacrifice. The other princes were all given&nbsp;their title when mentioned as recognition of the fact that none&nbsp;of them protested Nachshon having been chosen to be the&nbsp;first one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וקרבנו</span><span class="font5">, “and his offering, etc.” the strange prefix of&nbsp;the letter ו meaning: “and,” when no other offering had been&nbsp;offered as yet, is explained by the Torah having written in&nbsp;verse 12; ויהי המקריב, “and he that presented, etc.” By adding&nbsp;this prefix the Torah wishes us to understand that what&nbsp;follows was what the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">person</span><span class="font5"> mentioned in verse 12&nbsp;presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate approach: the reason that Nachshon’s offering is introduced by the connective letter ו is that he&nbsp;should not boast about having been the first prince to be&nbsp;allowed to present this offering. [If he even did not mind that&nbsp;his title was omitted, he was hardly likely to boast about&nbsp;anything. Ed. ]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קערת כסף, </span><span class="font5">“a silver dish,” what is the difference between a קערה and a מזרק, a basin? According to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri,</span><span class="font5"> a bowl is&nbsp;thick and a מזרק is thin. It weighed only slightly more than half&nbsp;the weight of a מזרק</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כף אחת עשרה זהב</span><span class="font5">, “one golden pan weighing ten&nbsp;shekel; the shekel is a weight measure applied to silver, not&nbsp;usually to gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;פר אחד בן בקר</span><span class="font5">, “one young bullock;” compare the&nbsp;word בן as describing something you when used in&nbsp;connection with pigeons, i.e. בן יונה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,17. זה קרבן, </span><span class="font5">“</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font5"> was the offering, etc.” This apparently&nbsp;superfluous word was to hint that these princes added&nbsp;incense to their offerings, something not usually permitted to&nbsp;an offering of an individual. Not only that, but they also&nbsp;offered a sin offering each, although they had not been guilty&nbsp;of any sin requiring this. In addition, and even more&nbsp;remarkable, at least one of them offered his offering on the&nbsp;Sabbath when individual offerings must not be offered.&nbsp;(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,48. ביום השביעי, </span><span class="font5">“on the seventh day;” this day was a Sabbath; permission was granted to not interrupt this string&nbsp;of sacrifices of which G’d had told Moses that they should be&nbsp;offered on consecutive days. (Verse 11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,89. ובבא משה, “</span><span class="font5">and when Moses entered;” seeing that the subject here is the consecration of the altar, we are told&nbsp;here that the Presence of the Lord was manifest over the&nbsp;Tabernacle, and that G’d’s voice emanated from within it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators feel that the beginning of the Book of Leviticus completes the report about the consecration of&nbsp;the altar. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Beha-alotcha</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,2. דנר אל אהרן</span><span class="font5">, speak to Aaron, etc.; the commandment about lighting the lamps on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">menorah</span><span class="font5"> appears&nbsp;immediately following the consecration rites of the altar&nbsp;because we have heard about twelve tribal leaders each&nbsp;offering a sacrifice on that occasion, while the tribe of Levi,&nbsp;i.e. its representative, Aaron, has not been allocated any role&nbsp;in that important event. The Levites had started to grumble&nbsp;about having been excluded from these festivities. They&nbsp;wanted to know the reason why they had been excluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a result, G’d immediately told Aaron and his sons that what the representatives of the other tribes had done&nbsp;was only in the nature of something preparatory, whereas it&nbsp;had been reserved for them to do the actual consecration of&nbsp;the Temple/altar. The reader is referred by our author to&nbsp;Nachmanides’ lengthy and comprehensive commentary on&nbsp;this paragraph. Aaron is initially to involve his sons in these&nbsp;activities and subsequently also other members of the tribe&nbsp;of Levi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בהעלותך את הנרות</span><span class="font5">, “when you light the lamps, etc.;” this command was issued on the day that the Tabernacle had&nbsp;been erected (and stayed up) because they started to light&nbsp;the lamps in order to teach that these lamps burned&nbsp;throughout the night, also. The light in the Tabernacle was&nbsp;like an eternal flame (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find something similar in connection with the prophet Samuel, (Samuel I 3-4) 'ונר אלוקים טרם יכבה״״ויקרא ה&nbsp;אל שמואל</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font5">“the lamp of G’d had not yet gone out, and Samuel&nbsp;was sleeping in the Temple, when called to Samuel.” (Our&nbsp;author directs the reader to the commentary known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">karney or,</span><span class="font5"> to follow up on this subject)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בהעלותך את הנרות אל מול פני המנורה</span><span class="font5">, “when you kindle the lamps towards the front of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">menorah;”</span><span class="font5"> the priest or High&nbsp;Priest performing this procedure was to take up position&nbsp;facing the seven lamps on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">menorah.</span><span class="font5"> As a result, the&nbsp;lights would all illuminate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The words: אל מול פני המנורה, do not refer to the words that follow: יאירו שבעת הנרות, as understood by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">as&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">is clear from what Aaron actually did as reported in the verse&nbsp;following, אל מול פני המנורה </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">העלה</span><span class="font5"> נרותיה, “he had lit the lamps&nbsp;while facing them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the words בהעלותך את הנרות, are to be understood literally. i.e. “when you raise the lamps;”&nbsp;you will then place the wicks in their positions. They are not&nbsp;considered as fixtures in their respective positions, seeing&nbsp;that we have read in Exodus 37,17: ויעש את המנורה, “he&nbsp;constructed the candlestick,” and subsequently we read:&nbsp;(Exodus 37,23) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויעש את נרותיה שבעה ומלקחיה</span><span class="font5">, “and he made&nbsp;the lamps thereof, seven, and their tongs;”</span></p>
<p dir="rtl"><span class="font5">“ ,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל מול פני המנורה יאירו שבעת הנרות</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He turned the seven mouths for the wicks towards the center shaft of the front of the candlestick, which faced the&nbsp;dividing curtain in the Sanctuary which was hung between&nbsp;the Sanctuary and the innermost holies housing the Ark. This&nbsp;would make sense according to the sage who claims that the&nbsp;position of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">menorah</span><span class="font5"> was in a north-south direction i.e. its&nbsp;broadside was facing the dividing curtain, in one direction&nbsp;whereas the opposite broadside faced the entrance of the&nbsp;Sanctuary. According to the sage who claims that the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">menorah</span><span class="font5"> was positioned in an east-west direction, it would&nbsp;have faced the Table in the Sanctuary. This is how we can&nbsp;interpret what is written in Exodus 4,24: וישם את המנורה נוכח&nbsp;השולחן, “he placed the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">menorah</span><span class="font5"> opposite the Table.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יאירו שבעת הנרות</span><span class="font5">, “the seven lamps shall provide illumination. This would refer to the six lamps, three on either&nbsp;side of the center shaft of the candlestick. According to our&nbsp;author this would be the correct text in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> but the scribes&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> manuscripts have omitted a word by mistake, i.e.&nbsp;the word האמצעי, “the centre shaft” (the lamp on it)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,4. וזה מעשה המנורה</span><span class="font5">, “and this was the work of the candlestick;” this verse is one of three verses with which&nbsp;Moses had difficulty, according to our sages. This is hinted at&nbsp;by the word: וזה. (Compare Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;29) According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> here the three were: our verse, the&nbsp;second one the verse in Exodus 12 about the position of the&nbsp;moon at new moon, and the third was the verse dealing with&nbsp;creeping animals. The reason that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> did not include&nbsp;the word זה in זה יתנו, “this they shall give” (the half shekel&nbsp;coin in Exodus 30,13) is that Moses had no problem&nbsp;imagining the size and shape of a coin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.6. קח את הלוים</span><span class="font5">, “take the Levites;” this line was said on&nbsp;the day that the Tabernacle had been erected; (Talmud,&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin</span><span class="font5"> 60) seeing that the laws pertaining to the&nbsp;Levites were recorded in writing on that day, as on that day&nbsp;they commenced the part of their service that involved their&nbsp;daily songs of praise. The paragraph was written in&nbsp;chronological order, and the two previous paragraphs, one of&nbsp;which commenced with הקרב את מטה לוי, (Numbers 3,6) and&nbsp;the other which commenced with the words: ואני הנה לקחתי את&nbsp;הלוים, (Numbers 3,12) these paragraphs referred to the&nbsp;position where the Levies encamped around the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the Tabernacle had been erected and the positioning of the flags had been arranged and the lights of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">menorah</span><span class="font5"> had been kindled, G’d (Moses) ordered the&nbsp;Levites to commence their daily service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The paragraph dealing with the Levites’ service was written next to that of the kindling of the lights in order to tell&nbsp;us that the priests were to busy themselves with that at the&nbsp;same time as when the Levites were performing their&nbsp;service. Apart from that they would assist the Levites in their&nbsp;service, [seeing they were Levites also. Ed.] (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מתוך בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “from among the Children of Israel.” Up until that time they had been part of the ordinary Israelites.&nbsp;(Ibn Ezra).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הזה עליהם מי חטאת</span><span class="font5">, “sprinkle the water of purification&nbsp;on them;” it is impossible to say that this command was&nbsp;issued on the day when this paragraph was revealed, as on&nbsp;the day when the Tabernacle had been erected the&nbsp;procedure of burning the red heifer had not yet been&nbsp;performed. (Jerusalem Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah</span><span class="font5"> 3,3, and&nbsp;quoted by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin</span><span class="font5"> folio 60) The red heifer was burned&nbsp;on the day following. We therefore have to understand the&nbsp;sequence as being as follows: it is taken for granted that the&nbsp;sprinkling of the purification waters took place after the&nbsp;procedure with the red heifer had been performed. (Numbers&nbsp;chapter 19) Even though the Levites were obligated to purify&nbsp;themselves in anticipation of performing their service as&nbsp;otherwise they could not have sung their songs, since the&nbsp;day when the Tabernacle had been erected, we must&nbsp;assume that they used the oil with which they had been&nbsp;anointed in lieu of the waters containing the ash of the red&nbsp;heifer. Commencing with that day, it became the task of the&nbsp;Levites to dismantle the Tabernacle and to re-assemble it as&nbsp;the progress of the Israelites’ journeys demanded this. Prior&nbsp;to that, when they needed to become purified they used&nbsp;either blood from the altar or some of the oil of anointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 4 states that the water of the red heifer took the place of blood which had&nbsp;been used previously in the procedure of purification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הזה עליהם מי חטאת</span><span class="font5">, “sprinkle water of purification on them” Seeing that from that day on they were charged with&nbsp;the dismantling and reassembling the Tabernacle, they&nbsp;would have to undergo this sprinkling on the third and&nbsp;seventh day of a seven day period. [This editor finds it&nbsp;difficult to reconcile this with the Torah’s statement that on&nbsp;occasion the Tabernacle was put up only for a single day, as&nbsp;the Israelites moved on again as soon as the cloud above it&nbsp;moved. (Numbers 9,18-23) Ed.] The reason that this was&nbsp;needed was that it was impossible for the Levites not to have&nbsp;been in contact with dead bodies while the people were&nbsp;encamped, especially after the sin of the spies when dying&nbsp;had to have become a daily occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והעבירו תער על כל בשרם</span><span class="font5">, “and let the cause a razor to pass over all their flesh;” they had to do this every time prior&nbsp;to the sprinkling of the ash in the water of the red heifer on&nbsp;the third and seventh day of their purification ritual. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">mentions in his commentary here that he found in the&nbsp;writings of Rabbi Moshe </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hadarshan,</span><span class="font5"> that seeing that the&nbsp;Levites had functioned as the instruments of atonement for&nbsp;the firstborn who had been guilty during the episode of the&nbsp;golden calf, and that was called a זבחי מתים, “offering of the&nbsp;dead,” and the “leprous” (מצורעים) people also referred to as&nbsp;“dead,” [compare Numbers 12,11-13. Ed.] the Levites&nbsp;required shaving of all body hair as required from “leprous”&nbsp;people during their purification process after the priest has&nbsp;declared them as healed. (Leviticus chapter 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,8. ולקחו פר בן בקר</span><span class="font5">, “then let them take a young bullock, etc,” this was to serve as a consecration rite for the services&nbsp;they would perform henceforth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: they have to take a young bullock seeing that the firstborn whom they replaced had&nbsp;served the golden calf at the instruction of others, at that&nbsp;time. We derive this from the line in Exodus 32,4: אלה אלוהיך&nbsp;ישראל, “these are </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font5"> gods, Israel.” In other words:&nbsp;someone, -the mixed multitude- seduced the Israelites. We&nbsp;find in Numbers 15,24: “then it shall be, if it be done in error&nbsp;by the congregation, it having been hidden from their eyes,&nbsp;that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a&nbsp;burnt offering, etc,” The subject there is the person who had&nbsp;inadvertently committed the sin of idolatry</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ופר שני</span><span class="font5">, “and a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">second</span><span class="font5"> bullock, etc.;” in commenting on the word שני, second, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points out that the sin offering&nbsp;when applicable, must precede the offering of a burnt&nbsp;offering. [How could a burnt offering be welcome before the&nbsp;Lord as long as the person guilty of bringing a sin offering for&nbsp;his atonement has not first done so? Ed.] The point of the&nbsp;Torah using this sequence therefore is to teach us that just&nbsp;as no parts of a burnt offering may be eaten by the donor or&nbsp;the priest, so in this instance, no part of the sin offering may&nbsp;be eaten either. Our author, in elaborating on that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">adds that the Levites used this bullock as their consecration&nbsp;offering as is clear from Leviticus 9,11,where it is spelled out&nbsp;specifically, and it was a sin offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תקח לחטאת, </span><span class="font5">“you shall take as a sin offering.” When it came to “taking,” i.e. sanctifying and setting the offering&nbsp;aside for its purpose, the Torah mentions the burnt offering&nbsp;first. The reason is that the more valuable one of these two&nbsp;bullocks was the one used for the burnt offering.&nbsp;Nonetheless, when it came to the sequence of which of&nbsp;these two animals would be </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">offered</span><span class="font5"> on the altar first, the sin&nbsp;offering took precedence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah paid the Levites a compliment, by not requiring them to offer a male goat as a sin offering, for if it&nbsp;had insisted on this, the impression could have been created&nbsp;that the Levites had to atone for the inadvertently committed&nbsp;sin of idolatry. They had not been guilty of that. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,9.והקרבת את הלוים לפני אהל מועד </span><span class="font5">, “you shall present the Levites at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting;” we find a&nbsp;similar construction in Leviticus 14,11, where the priest is&nbsp;presenting the person to be purified at the entrance of the&nbsp;Tabernacle, i.e. “before the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וסמחו בני ישראל את ידיהם </span><span class="font5">“and the Children of Israel&nbsp;shall place their hands, etc;” the “Children of Israel” referred&nbsp;to here are the firstborn for whom the Levites had served as&nbsp;atonement. Every firstborn Israelite would place his hands on&nbsp;the Levite who was to perform that service for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וסמכו בני ישראל את ידיהם על הלוים</span><span class="font5">, we find this kind of procedure also in Numbers 27,18, where G’d tells Moses to&nbsp;appoint Joshua as his successor, i.e. וסמכת ידך עליו, “you are&nbsp;to place your hand upon him.” Whenever this procedure is&nbsp;mentioned in the Bible it means that authority is being&nbsp;transferred by the person placing his hand or hands on the&nbsp;person to be appointed. The first person to do so was&nbsp;Yaakov in Genesis 48,14, where he placed his right had on&nbsp;Joseph’s younger son Ephrayim, indicating that he should be&nbsp;treated as his firstborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והניף אהרן את הלוים מאת בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “and Aaron is to&nbsp;wave the Levites (as an offering) from the Children of Israel;”&nbsp;Aaron was chosen to do this as he was the agent appointed&nbsp;for this by the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על ראש הפרים</span><span class="font5">, “on the heads of the bullocks;” on&nbsp;the head of each one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.13. והעמדת את הלוים לפני אהרן ולפני בניו</span><span class="font5">, “and you shall position the Levites in front of Aaron and his sons;” this was&nbsp;to show the people that the Levites were under the authority&nbsp;of the priests, as we explained already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וטהרת אותם</span><span class="font5">, “you will purify them;” you will sprinkle&nbsp;ash from the red heifer on them on the third and seventh day&nbsp;of the purification rites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי נתונים נתונים המה לי</span><span class="font5">, “for they are wholly given to&nbsp;Me;” the Levites are viewed as a gift given by the Jewish&nbsp;people to G’d, Who, in turn, passed this gift on to Aaron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לקחתי אותם לי</span><span class="font5">, “I have taken them unto Me.” G’d is saying: “I have accepted this gift from the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ביום הכותי כל בכור</span><span class="font5">, “on the day when I smote every&nbsp;firstborn. On a different occasion, in Exodus 12,29, the&nbsp;smiting of the firstborn was not described as having occurred&nbsp;on “a day,” but as having occurred at midnight. We see from&nbsp;here that every time the Torah uses the term: יום, “day,” it&nbsp;speaks of a 24 hour period, i.e. night and day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.18. ואקח את הלוים תחת כל בכור</span><span class="font5">, “I have taken the Levites instead of the firstborn.” If all the firstborn were to&nbsp;perform service in the Temple, this would lead to the people&nbsp;suffering a plague, as there was no guarantee that the father&nbsp;of the firstborn performing that service had also been a&nbsp;firstborn, neither his grandfather. As a result, that family had&nbsp;not had an opportunity to become thoroughly familiar with all&nbsp;the intricacies of Temple service. Failure to perform the&nbsp;service properly would result in G’d’s killing such a person as&nbsp;we know from what happened to the two older sons of Aaron,&nbsp;Nadav and Avihu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once the Levites had been appointed and the status had become a hereditary one, each member of each family&nbsp;made a point of being thoroughly familiar with all their duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is why the Torah writes: 'לא יהיה ללוי חלק ונחלה וגו, “the Levite is not to own ancestral land in the lad of Israel;”&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 18,1) by not owning land and growing crops&nbsp;they were free to concentrate on their tasks as Levites. They&nbsp;should not acquire too much familiarity with the tools used by&nbsp;farmers and artisans, so that they would not be diverted from&nbsp;their principal vocation, service in the Temple. If the Levite&nbsp;were to devote himself to those mundane activities, his&nbsp;fingers would become too coarse to play the musical&nbsp;instruments efficiently to accompany the choir of Levites&nbsp;during the time when Temple service was in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעבוד את עבודת בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “to perform the service of the Children of Israel (collectively), which basically had been the&nbsp;task of the firstborn of each family in each tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יהיה בבני ישראל נגף</span><span class="font5">, “and the there will not be a plague among the Children of Israel,” even a single one of them. We&nbsp;can find similar constructions in Exodus 21,11: ואם שלש אלה&nbsp;לא יעשה לה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">and if (her master) does not do one of these&nbsp;three economically constructive actions for her, etc.” (Exodus&nbsp;21,11) Compare also Judges 12,7, “he was buried in the&nbsp;towns of the region of Gilead.” [All the people of surrounding&nbsp;towns took part in Yiftach’s burial. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כן עשו להם בני ישראל, </span><span class="font5">“so did the Children of Israel.”&nbsp;They placed their weight with their hands upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתחטאו הלוים</span><span class="font5">, “the Levites purified themselves.”&nbsp;They did so by means of sprinkling the waters containing the&nbsp;ash of the red heifer upon themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כן עשו להם</span><span class="font5">, “so they did unto them.” The Levites&nbsp;did so to the priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: “so did </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Aaron</span><span class="font5"> and his sons to the Levites.” This interpretation is based on Numbers 4,19:&nbsp;וזאת עשו להם וחיו, “this is what you are to do unto them so that&nbsp;they will live.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,24. זאת אשר ללוים</span><span class="font5">, ”this is what pertains to the Levites:”&nbsp;Levites are disqualified from performing their tasks if either&nbsp;too young or too old. They are not disqualified if afflicted by&nbsp;physical blemishes as are the priests. (Talmud, tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 24.) Priests are not disqualified by age&nbsp;limitations, (if otherwise healthy and fit.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This paragraph was only written (or taught) for use in the desert, as we learned on that same folio in the Talmud.&nbsp;We read there as follows: “a Levite from the age of thirty until&nbsp;the age of fifty, is fit to perform all the tasks that he is&nbsp;designated to perform. After that he is unfit regardless of his&nbsp;physical condition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under what circumstances does this rule apply? During the period of the Tabernacle in the desert, seeing that as&nbsp;long as the people had not yet settled, parts of the service&nbsp;that had to be performed involved carrying the furnishings of&nbsp;the Tabernacle on their shoulders, like the Kehatites who had&nbsp;to carry the Holy Ark on their shoulders. This could only be&nbsp;done by people who had attained the age of thirty, which is&nbsp;generally understood as the age of maximum physical&nbsp;strength. Once the Tabernacle was stationary (for 369 years)&nbsp;at Shiloh, and the people were settled, according to the&nbsp;opinion of Rabbi Yossi, the Levites would become&nbsp;disqualified only if their voices revealed that they had aged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wherefrom did he derive such a rule? He quoted Chronicles II 5,13, where we read: ויהי כאחד למחצצרים ומשוררים להשמיע קול&nbsp;אחד, “their singing became as if they all sang with one voice&nbsp;(choir) as the sound of the trumpets and the cymbals; which&nbsp;sounded as if of one voice.” In other words, if the voice of a&nbsp;Levite had changed due to aging, he was no longer capable&nbsp;of being part of this choir. This is how </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains the text&nbsp;in the chapter called הכל שוחטים in the first chapter of the&nbsp;Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מבן חמש ועשרים שנה</span><span class="font5">, “from twenty five years of age and up;” this appears to contradict the statement in Numbers 4,3,&nbsp;where the Torah speaks of “from thirty years and up;”&nbsp;according to the plain meaning all the Levites were mobilised&nbsp;from the age of 25 years and up, at which time they began to&nbsp;perform tasks, such as standing guard and to sing in the&nbsp;choir; in other words, to perform the relatively easy tasks. By&nbsp;the time they reached the age of thirty, they were also&nbsp;required to perform the physically difficult tasks. The&nbsp;Kehatites began then to carry the Ark on their shoulders, and&nbsp;the members of the family of Gersonides and Merari then&nbsp;began to load the wagons with the parts of the Tabernacle&nbsp;each had been assigned to, and to the dismantling and reerecting the structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,25. ומבן חמשים שנה ישוב</span><span class="font5">, “and from fifty years he would retire from whichever part of the service he had been&nbsp;assigned to.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יעבוד עוד </span><span class="font5">“and he would no longer perform service.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this refers only to service involving&nbsp;carrying with his shoulder, but he would still perform such&nbsp;tasks as opening and closing the gates. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">these verses were not addressed to the members of the&nbsp;families of Gershon and Merari, for if they were, how could&nbsp;he have said that they were still performing the tasks of&nbsp;loading and unloading? We must therefore conclude that the&nbsp;over fifty year old members of the families of Gershon and&nbsp;Merari also retired from their specific duties at that age.&nbsp;Perhaps </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> had in mind the 369 years that the&nbsp;Tabernacle stood in Shiloh, when these tasks did not have to&nbsp;be performed as the Tabernacle was no longer a prefab to&nbsp;be moved from time to time. The words: “to load the&nbsp;wagons,” in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> would then have applied only to the&nbsp;periods when the Jewish people were in the desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,26. ושרת את אחיו</span><span class="font5">, “but shall minister with their brethren;” when this Levite turns fifty, he shall minister with&nbsp;the other Levites who have already turned fifty. This is based&nbsp;on Numbers 1,50: “they are to encamp immediately around&nbsp;the Tabernacle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועבודה לא יעבוד עוד</span><span class="font5">, “he is no longer to perform physical tasks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,1. בחדש הראשון</span><span class="font5">, “in the first month;” The Torah writes here: במדבר סיני, “in the desert of Sinai,” and it did so also in&nbsp;Numbers 1,1, when that date was in the second year of the&nbsp;Israelites’ wanderings. This teaches that what was&nbsp;communicated to the Israelites on both occasions was told to&nbsp;them on the first day of the month. Here </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments&nbsp;that the communication recorded </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">there</span><span class="font5"> was not&nbsp;communicated to them until the beginning of the second&nbsp;month. This was to teach us that the author of the Torah did&nbsp;not feel obligated to order Moses to write things down in&nbsp;chronological order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why did the Torah (Moses) not write this chapter at the beginning of the Book of Numbers? He did not want to&nbsp;commence this Book with recording matters which reflected&nbsp;negatively on the Jewish people. If you were to counter: what&nbsp;is so negative, seeing that in the Book of Exodus chapter</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">12,25, the people’s coming to the land of Israel and receiving&nbsp;it as their ancestral heritage was made conditional on their&nbsp;observing the laws connected with the Exodus?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact is that had it not been for the people’s complaining as reported in this chapter, they would have&nbsp;come to the land of Israel much sooner and the question of&nbsp;observing the anniversary of the Exodus in the desert would&nbsp;never have arisen. They would have entered the land of&nbsp;Israel during the month in which the event recorded in this&nbsp;chapter occurred. As it is, they moved away from Mount&nbsp;Sinai on the 20<sup>th</sup> day of the month of Iyar, and Moses told the&nbsp;people that there was only eleven days’ march to the land of&nbsp;Canaan from Mount Sinai. In fact, in expectation of this,&nbsp;Moses had invited his father-in-law Yitro to accompany them&nbsp;on that short journey in verse 29 of our chapter, indicating&nbsp;that they would move on forthwith. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;way Moses had formulated this invitation it meant that within&nbsp;a maximum of 3 days the Israelites would break camp </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">and&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">enter the Holy Land. They would have had ample time to&nbsp;prepare for the Passover which was to commence on the&nbsp;evening of the fifteenth of that month. Now, seeing that the&nbsp;Israelites had become guilty of the sin of demanding meat in&nbsp;an unfitting manner, and they had spent a whole month&nbsp;eating the quail, except for the ones who died from&nbsp;overindulging even earlier, the time to observe the Passover&nbsp;in the Holy Land had already passed. (Numbers 11,29) They&nbsp;were delayed again on account of having to wait until Miriam&nbsp;had been healed after she had spoken deprecatingly of her&nbsp;brother Moses. (Numbers 12,1-16). Subsequently, they were&nbsp;delayed for 40 days while Moses had to send out spies to&nbsp;pacify the doubters. To cap it all, the whole generation of the&nbsp;adults who had left Egypt were condemned to die in the&nbsp;desert for having preferred to return to Egypt rather than to&nbsp;trust the Lord to bring them to the Holy Land. All of this were&nbsp;events which Moses did not wish to record at the beginning&nbsp;of this Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויעשו בני ישראל את הפסח במועדו</span><span class="font5">, “let the Children of&nbsp;Israel perform the Passover rites at its appointed time in the&nbsp;calendar. The letter פ in the word: הפסח has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz&nbsp;gadol</span><span class="font5"> under it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וככל משפטיו</span><span class="font5">, “and according to all the ordinances&nbsp;thereof;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this refers to the festival being&nbsp;observed for the full seven days, the search for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chametz</span><span class="font5"> and&nbsp;its disposal prior to the beginning of the festival, all in&nbsp;accordance with what has been written in chapter 12 of the&nbsp;Book of Exodus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,5. ויעשו את הפסח</span><span class="font5">, “they performed the ritual of the Passover;” according to Rabbi Yossi in the Tossephta, this&nbsp;was the only time in all the years that the Israelites wandered&nbsp;in the desert that the Passover was actually observed. The&nbsp;reason for this was that at the time described they were&nbsp;encamped in a location where it was possible to perform&nbsp;circumcisions without endangering the lives of the infants&nbsp;being circumcised. This has been explained at the beginning&nbsp;of the Book of Joshua where a mass circumcision took place&nbsp;of all the people who had been born after the Exodus and&nbsp;who could not have been circumcised on account of the&nbsp;danger to the lives of these infants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,6. ויהי אנשים</span><span class="font5">, “There were certain men, etc.” this&nbsp;paragraph teaches that the legislation for a “second&nbsp;Passover”, i.e. instead of the original date, is applicable only&nbsp;to individuals but not to the whole congregation, regardless&nbsp;of why they could not observe the original date. This&nbsp;legislation was made public on the day that the Tabernacle&nbsp;had been erected, i.e. two weeks before the date of&nbsp;Passover, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri</span><span class="font5"> on verse 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר היו טמאים לנפש אדם, </span><span class="font5">“who had become ritually impure due to contact with a dead human body;” according to&nbsp;Rabbi Yitzchok, if these people’s impurity stemmed from the&nbsp;fact that they had been the carriers of the ark in which the&nbsp;remains of Joseph were being transported, they would have&nbsp;had time enough to purify themselves as the people had&nbsp;been stationary since the first of month at the latest. On the&nbsp;other hand, if these men were the ones who had carried the&nbsp;caskets in which Nadav and Avihu were being carried, they&nbsp;had plenty of time to purify themselves as these two men had&nbsp;died on the eighth day of Nissan; the Tabernacle had been&nbsp;erected on the first day of Nissan; on the second day of&nbsp;Nissan Eleazar had burned the red heifer (Jerusalem&nbsp;Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah, 3,3)</span><span class="font5"> and according to the Talmud in&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin</span><span class="font5"> on that day eight different subjects were&nbsp;revealed, one of them being the one containing the&nbsp;legislation about the red heifer. Seeing that the two sons of&nbsp;Aaron died on the first day of Nissan, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">parshat&nbsp;Sh’mini,</span><span class="font5"> these men could have completed their purification&nbsp;rites already on the eighth day of that month, in plenty of time&nbsp;before Passover. We are left therefore with the question&nbsp;whose death had caused their ritual impurity? The only&nbsp;answer that is reasonable is that they became ritually impure&nbsp;through burying someone who had no relatives who could&nbsp;bury him, and they fulfilled this commandment, something&nbsp;that if it occurred to a High Priest even he would have been&nbsp;obliged to attend to. (Compare </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יכלו לעשות הפסח</span><span class="font5">, “so that they had been unable to observe the commandment of offering the Passover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום ההוא</span><span class="font5">, “on that day.” The emphasis on the word ההוא suggests that if Passover had commenced only a single day&nbsp;later, these people would have completed their purification&nbsp;rites in time. In other words, their last day of purification rites&nbsp;occurred on Passover eve. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,7. למה נגרע</span><span class="font5">, “what for are we to be denied?” Why are&nbsp;we not allowed to eat holy things while in a state of ritual&nbsp;impurity, seeing that last year when we were in Egypt we&nbsp;also ate it in a state of ritual impurity? The reason is that at&nbsp;that time we had not been warned not to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;או בדרך רחוקה</span><span class="font5">, “or on a journey far off;” there is a&nbsp;dot on the letter ה in the word רחוקה; this dot is not connected&nbsp;to the word בדרך, for if so, the word would be treated as if it&nbsp;had not appeared. Rather, that dot connects to the word איש,&nbsp;“a man or person;” we are to understand the person&nbsp;concerned as being </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">spiritually</span><span class="font5"> on a journey that had&nbsp;estranged him to Judaism and its G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או לדורותיכם</span><span class="font5">, “or someone of your generations;” the verse means that the person described is either at this time&nbsp;far from you spiritually or time wise, in other words, if many&nbsp;years from now there will be someone who due to the time&nbsp;that elapsed since the Exodus feels disconnected to our&nbsp;history, and therefore would not observe the Passover ritual&nbsp;by having his heart in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בחודש השני, </span><span class="font5">“in the second month;” seeing that the&nbsp;observance of the original Passover in Egypt was restricted&nbsp;to a single calendar day, they were not commanded&nbsp;concerning this now; but once when the Tabernacle had&nbsp;been built, people who had missed it through no fault of their&nbsp;own would be given a chance to make up for all of its&nbsp;essentials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,13. ובדרך לא היה</span><span class="font5">, “and he did not have the excuse of&nbsp;being too far away from Jerusalem,” or he had never even&nbsp;set out on the journey to Jerusalem; we find a similar&nbsp;construction in Exodus 21,15: מכה אביו ואמו, “if someone&nbsp;strikes his father or his mother. Not “his father </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font5"> his&nbsp;mother.” The connective letter ו in the word בדרך here, also&nbsp;means “or,” not “and.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחדל </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">לעשות</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> הפסח</span><span class="font5">, “and he omits to perform the Passover ritual;” the Torah could have written: מעשות הפסח, thus saving&nbsp;a full word. The choice of words by the Torah teaches that&nbsp;the person the Torah has in mind here is the one who&nbsp;reasons that he can always make up for his failure to&nbsp;observe the Passover in Nissan, by observing it in lyar. We&nbsp;can find the root חדל used in a similar fashion in Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">11,8, ויחדלו </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">לבנות</span><span class="font5"> העיר, when the people of the generation of&nbsp;the Tower gave up that attempt after their languages had&nbsp;become confused. The choice of the word לעשות, instead of&nbsp;מעשות was also used when the Torah described G’d in&nbsp;Genesis 2,3 as having ceased His creative activities of the&nbsp;first six days. Instead of writing כי בו שבת </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">מעשות</span><span class="font5"> כל מלאכתו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“for&nbsp;on it He ceased from completing all His work</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,” </span><span class="font5">the Torah&nbsp;wrote אשר ברא אלוקים לעשות, thereby hinting that He was&nbsp;going to continue being involved in the improvement of His&nbsp;universe. The correct translation of that line would be: “for on&nbsp;it He ceased from completing all His work of creating.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכי יגור אתכם גר, </span><span class="font5">“and when a stranger has taken up&nbsp;temporary residence amongst you;” at this point the Torah&nbsp;reverts back to the rules governing the “second,” or&nbsp;“substitute” Passover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וביום הקים את השמכן</span><span class="font5">, ”and on the day when the&nbsp;Tabernacle had been erected;” since the Torah wished to&nbsp;speak about the journeys and the flags, it informs us about&nbsp;the manner in which the cloud that rested above the&nbsp;Tabernacle when the Israelites were stationary, ever since&nbsp;the Tabernacle had been put up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כסה הענן את המשכן, </span><span class="font5">“the cloud covered the Tabernacle.” This cloud was not the same cloud as the one that enveloped&nbsp;the entire camp of the Jewish people, and which therefore&nbsp;was at a higher elevation, as pointed out by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Tanchuma&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bamidbar</span><span class="font5"> 12. The cloud mentioned as covering the&nbsp;Tabernacle actually covered it as well as the surrounding&nbsp;area where the Levites had their dwellings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונעלה הענן בבקר</span><span class="font5">, “and when the cloud had&nbsp;ascended in the morning, etc.” This teaches that G’d did not&nbsp;inconvenience the people by making them break camp at&nbsp;midnight, etc. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">9.22.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או יומים או חדש ימים</span><span class="font5">, “or two days, or even a month&nbsp;of days.” If the Torah had not written this verse I would have&nbsp;said that the cloud never moved until it had remained in&nbsp;place either for a whole year or only for one night. This is&nbsp;why it had to add the words: “or two days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,2. עשה לך שתי חצוצרות, </span><span class="font5">“make yourself two trumpets, etc.” they were meant to be at Moses’ disposal at all times so&nbsp;that he would not have to send out to find someone who&nbsp;owned trumpets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;החונים קדמה</span><span class="font5">, “who were encamped on the eastern&nbsp;side;” the flag of the army group headed by Yehudah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;החונים תימנה</span><span class="font5">,”who were encamped on the southern&nbsp;side;” the army group headed by Reuven and his flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We might have thought that just as signals were blown for the eastern and southern army group to form in formation,&nbsp;so the trumpets would also be blown as signals for the army&nbsp;group in the west and the one in the north. By writing the&nbsp;word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’ruah,</span><span class="font5"> alarm, in the singular mode the Torah made&nbsp;clear that only two alarms were blown on these trumpets “for&nbsp;them to commence their journeys (pl).” There is another&nbsp;opinion which holds that separate alarms were blown on the&nbsp;trumpets for each army group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותקעתם תרועה שנית</span><span class="font5">, “you will blow a second alarm.” From this verse we learn that every time a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’ruah</span><span class="font5"> was blown it had&nbsp;been preceded by the signal known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tekiyah</span><span class="font5"> both before&nbsp;and after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותקעתם תרועה שנית</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this line as follows: the signal to start </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">journeying</span><span class="font5"> was to blow in this&nbsp;order: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tekiyah-truah- tekiyah.</span><span class="font5"> If the trumpets were being used&nbsp;to call the people to an assembly, however, no </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’ruah</span><span class="font5"> was&nbsp;blown. Our author continues with speculations about what&nbsp;appears to be repetition in this paragraph. As there will not&nbsp;again be an opportunity to re-enact the procedure in reality, I&nbsp;have decided to save time and space and not translate his&nbsp;speculations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובהקהיל את הקהל</span><span class="font5">, “but when the assembly is to be&nbsp;called together, etc.” on this verse </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments: “seeing&nbsp;that we might have thought that seeing that the construction&nbsp;of the trumpets had been introduced as something that&nbsp;Moses was to do personally, and use by himself, that just as&nbsp;for breaking camp there would be a blast of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tekiyah</span><span class="font5"> followed&nbsp;by a blast of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’ruah,</span><span class="font5"> followed again by a blast of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tekiyah,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;same would be the signal for a general assembly; However,&nbsp;if that were so how would the people have known the&nbsp;significance of these blasts? In order to prevent such a&nbsp;misunderstanding, the Torah in our verse specifically warns&nbsp;that when the trumpet call served to call the people to an&nbsp;assembly there would not be the alarming blast of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’ruah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.8. והיו לכם לחוקת עולם לדורותיכם</span><span class="font5">, “they shall be for you</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">as a statute forever, throughout your generations. These (trumpets) will serve you as a statute. They were given to&nbsp;you as a statute, i.e. only to be used while in the desert;&nbsp;whereas all the other vessels used in the Tabernacle or in&nbsp;connection with it, were to be used also </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> the people&nbsp;settled in the Holy Land, i.e. “throughout your generations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכי תבאו מלחמה</span><span class="font5">, “and when you go to war;” the&nbsp;Torah employs a variety of words when referring to becoming&nbsp;involved in wars, another one being והיה כי תראנה מלחמה, “it&nbsp;will be when war will break out” (Pharaoh to his people in&nbsp;Exodus 1,10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על הצר</span><span class="font5">, “on account of the enemy that oppresses you,” (a defensive war) the preposition על, as “on account of”&nbsp;occurs also in Psalms 44.23: כי עליך הורגנו כל היום, “for on Your&nbsp;account we are being killed on any day;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'ונזכרתם לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “you will be remembered before (the throne) of the Lord;” the Torah will proceed to explain how&nbsp;this scenario will unfold, i.e. you will be saved from your&nbsp;attackers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.10</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותקעתם בחצוצרות, </span><span class="font5">“you will blow the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tekiyah</span><span class="font5"> blasts&nbsp;with the trumpets, etc.” (the Torah speaks of joyous&nbsp;occasions) in order that the people will realise that the&nbsp;offerings on their behalf are at that moment being presented&nbsp;and they can tune in spiritually to the meanings of these&nbsp;sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על זבחי שלמיכם</span><span class="font5">, “and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings;” this is a reference to sheep offered on Shavuot, when the trumpets were only blown to call attention to&nbsp;communal mandatory offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיו לכם לזכרון</span><span class="font5">, “which shall be for you a memorial;” on those days blowing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tekiyah</span><span class="font5"> will accompany the burnt&nbsp;offerings, whereas when the trumpets are blown on account&nbsp;of war, especially the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’ruah,</span><span class="font5"> alarming sounds, this was to&nbsp;bring your merits to the attention of the Lord so that He would&nbsp;help you prevail against your enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישכון הענן במדבר פארן</span><span class="font5">, “and the cloud came to rest&nbsp;in the wilderness of Paran.” This region included the location&nbsp;which became known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Taveyrah,</span><span class="font5"> another name for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kivrot&nbsp;hata-avah,</span><span class="font5"> where the meat hungry people died from&nbsp;overeating as if ravenously hungry. Included were also the&nbsp;locations named </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chatzerot, Ritmah, and Kadesh,</span><span class="font5"> all&nbsp;reminders of minor or major disasters. Proof of this is the fact&nbsp;that in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat</span><span class="font5"> Massey where all 42 way stations of the&nbsp;journeys of the people are listed chronologically, no mention&nbsp;is made of the wilderness of Paran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'על פי ה</span><span class="font5">, “at the command of the Lord;” by means&nbsp;of blowing the trumpets. [not verbal commands to Moses&nbsp;each time. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of these words: the command of the Lord was conveyed to the people when they&nbsp;observed the Levites dismantling or re-erecting the&nbsp;Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,21. והקימו את המשכן</span><span class="font5">, “so that they would be able to erect the Tabernacle.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the subjects in&nbsp;this verse are the members of the house of Gershon and&nbsp;Merari. There is a full stop here in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary.&nbsp;When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> continues there with: “two army groups had&nbsp;already preceded them,” this does not refer to the ”Merarites&nbsp;and Gersonidides,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">but refers to a different subject, namely the order in which the journeys proceeded. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has to be understood&nbsp;as follows; “when did the members of the house of Gershon&nbsp;and Merari re-erect the Tabernacle? After the first two army&nbsp;groups which had already preceded them and who in turn&nbsp;had preceded the Kehatites carrying the Holy Ark on their&nbsp;shoulders, had passed. The members of the house of&nbsp;Gershon and Merari had traveled as part of the first two army&nbsp;groups. When they observed that the cloud had stopped&nbsp;moving, this was their signal to re-erect the Tabernacle.&nbsp;During that period the Kehatites arrived and found the&nbsp;Tabernacle ready to receive the Holy Ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,25. מאסף לכל המחנות</span><span class="font5">, “the rearguard of all the camps. (army groups) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that the reason why the tribe&nbsp;of Dan formed the rearguard was that it was very numerous.&nbsp;Anyone who had lost something during the journey would&nbsp;hand it in to members of that tribe awaiting the loser to claim&nbsp;it. This follows the opinion that the Israelites were moving in&nbsp;the pattern of a box. The camp of Dan was in a northerly&nbsp;direction as a matter of routine. [The land of Israel being&nbsp;situated north of the land of Egypt, this would be normal. Ed.]&nbsp;Seeing that they numbered so many soldiers they could&nbsp;spread out over a wide area so that the left flank would&nbsp;actually be partially in the west. It would therefore be&nbsp;appropriate to apply the term מאסף, “ingatherer,” to that army&nbsp;group headed by the Danites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to argue that according to the text of the Torah, the army group headed by Yehudah numbered about&nbsp;16000 more soldiers than that of Dan, what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> meant was&nbsp;that of the three tribes comprising the army group headed by&nbsp;Dan, the tribe of Dan itself was more numerous that the other&nbsp;two tribes that formed part of his army group. The members&nbsp;of the tribe Dan itself were the hindmost of all the tribes in the&nbsp;various army groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מאסף לכל המחנות</span><span class="font5">, “the hindmost of all the army groups;” if any member of any of the other army groups due to fatigue&nbsp;fell behind, they would all be included in the group headed by&nbsp;the tribe of Dan, so that they would not become lone&nbsp;stragglers. We find the expression מאסף having a similar&nbsp;meaning in Judges 19,18: ואין איש מאסף אותי הביתה, “and no&nbsp;one would be willing to give me shelter in his house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,29. נוסעים אנחנו</span><span class="font5">, “we are about to embark on our journey to the Holy Land;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Moses invites&nbsp;Yitro to become a partner to Israel. At this point Moses still&nbsp;believes that both he and the people are on the way to&nbsp;immediately enter the Holy Land and to settle there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Moses had suggested to G’d that He send someone else to be the leader of the Jewish people, (Exodus&nbsp;4,13), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> commented that the reason why Moses said this&nbsp;was that he knew that he himself would not get to the Holy&nbsp;Land. According to the plain meaning of what Moses is&nbsp;saying here to his father-in-law, it is clear that he included&nbsp;himself among the people who would get to the land of&nbsp;Israel. He reasoned that if the people were to know that the&nbsp;man who had taken them out of Egypt and performed all&nbsp;these miracles would not be allowed to enter the Holy Land,&nbsp;what possible chance would an ordinary Israelite have to&nbsp;ever to get to that land? He therefore pretended that he&nbsp;would get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: Moses said this only to Yitro, as he reasoned that if he told or hinted to Yitro that he&nbsp;himself would not get to the Holy Land, surely Yitro would not&nbsp;believe that he would succeed where Moses did not, and&nbsp;therefore he would decline Moses’ offer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והטבנו לך</span><span class="font5">, “we will treat you well.” He meant that Yitro would be allowed to share in the loot the Israelites would&nbsp;secure from the Canaanites. He had not been authorized by&nbsp;G’d to promise him an ancestral piece of land in the Holy&nbsp;Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי אם אל ארצי ואל מולדתי אלך</span><span class="font5">, “but I prefer to go to&nbsp;my country and my birthplace” [to die there. Ed.] According to&nbsp;our author, Yitro preferred the evil he knew to the evil he did&nbsp;not know, i.e. he knew what awaited him in Midian, but he did&nbsp;not know what awaited him in the land of Canaan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל נא תעזוב אותנו</span><span class="font5">, “please do not abandon us!”&nbsp;We have not been able to show you how well we can treat&nbsp;you thus far. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי על כן ידעת חנותנו</span><span class="font5">, “for the reason you came here to see where we were encamped was in order to join us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיית לנו לעינים</span><span class="font5">, “and you have become our eyes” this is to be understood as Genesis 18,3: אם נא מצאתי חן בעיניך “if&nbsp;only I will find favour in your eyes.” The word עינים is used in&nbsp;the same sense as פנים, “face, front.” An alternate&nbsp;interpretation: other potential converts to Judaism will look at&nbsp;you as the example that inspires them to follow his example.&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר ייטיב ה' עמנו </span><span class="font5">“the good that the Lord will do for&nbsp;us.” Moses refers to nations in addition to the seven&nbsp;Canaanite nations. He refers to Exodus 34,24: והרחבתי את&nbsp;גבולך, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">I will expand your boundaries.” According to another&nbsp;view, Moses promised Yitro and his family the land belonging&nbsp;to the Kenites. This had been included as one of the ten&nbsp;nations whose lands G’d had promised to Avraham as being&nbsp;part of greater Israel (Genesis 15,19).This is why in future&nbsp;years the descendants of Yitro are usually referred to as&nbsp;Kenites, as for instance in Numbers 24,21, where Bileam&nbsp;prophesied about them. Compare also Samuel I 15,6 ויאמר&nbsp;שאול אל הקני, “Sha-ul said to the Kenite.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.33. 'ויסעו מהר ה</span><span class="font5">, “they journeyed away from the Mountain of the Lord;” all this time the Israelites had still&nbsp;remained next to Mount Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דרך שלשת ימים, </span><span class="font5">“for a distance of three days’ march;” the Torah did not write simply “שלשת ימים “ for three days; but it&nbsp;wrote: “a distance of three days.” This means that when they&nbsp;had started journeying they encamped once before the&nbsp;incident with the quails for a distance of three days march.&nbsp;These dates were the 20<sup>th</sup> of Iyar, the 21<sup>st</sup> and the 22<sup>nd</sup> of&nbsp;Iyar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'וארון ברית ה</span><span class="font5">, and the Ark of the covenant with the Lord, etc.,” some people claim that Moses had been carrying it,&nbsp;just as has been written in Michah 6,4: “I sent ahead of you&nbsp;Moses, Aaron and Miriam.” In other words, Moses carried the&nbsp;ark he had made for the second set of Tablets, whereas the&nbsp;Ark that had been made by Betzalel was carried between the&nbsp;second and the third army group as described earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.34. וענן ה' עליהם יומם ולילה</span><span class="font5">, “and the cloud of the Lord was above them both by day and by night. Regarding&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary that there were seven clouds during the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Israelites’ journeys, they were not all mentioned in a single paragraph, as pointed out in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat Kohanim.</span><span class="font5"> Four enveloped&nbsp;them from the four directions of the globe, and two from&nbsp;above and below. The seventh traveled ahead of them. This&nbsp;latter one is the one mentioned here. The others are&nbsp;mentioned in Numbers 14,14, Numbers 9,19, Exodus 40,36&nbsp;and 40,37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the view of Rabbi Yehudah, there were 13 such clouds, 2 in each direction of the globe, two above and&nbsp;two below, and one in front of them. According to the opinion&nbsp;of Rabbi Yoshia, there were only four clouds, whereas&nbsp;according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah hanassi, there&nbsp;were only two such clouds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי בנסוע הארון</span><span class="font5">, “It would be that whenever the&nbsp;Ark was moving forward, etc.” According to the Talmud in&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 116, quoting the opinion of Rabbi&nbsp;Shimon ben Gamliel, this short paragraph in the Torah&nbsp;(which is bracketed) will be removed from the Torah scrolls&nbsp;at some time in the future and it will be rewritten in the&nbsp;appropriate place. If so, why was it not written in the proper&nbsp;place to begin with? It was meant to separate positive&nbsp;occurrences that the people experienced from negative ones,&nbsp;such as the ones we will shortly be reading about. What is&nbsp;the “appropriate” place that it should have appeared in?&nbsp;According to Rabbi Yossi, on the folio of the Talmud in&nbsp;Shabbat 116, it should have appeared when we read about&nbsp;the flags, immediately after verse 21 in our chapter, where&nbsp;the Torah describes the Kehatites as carrying the Holy Ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאמר משה קומה ה</span><span class="font5">, “Moses said:” arise O Lord, etc.” He said so as the cloud appeared to have disappeared at the&nbsp;time when the people were on the march.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובנחה</span><span class="font5">, “and when it came to rest, etc.” the&nbsp;spelling of this word appears defective and it is to be read as&nbsp;if it had been written with the letter ו at the end instead of the&nbsp;letter .ה</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובנחה יאמר שובה</span><span class="font5">!,”and when it came to rest, he (Moses) would say: “return O Lord, etc.” This was necessary as the&nbsp;cloud had previously been inert. Moses wanted the cloud to&nbsp;actively “dwell” above the camp of the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">רבבות אלפי ישראל</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“unto the tens of thousands of families of Israel.” The expression means that Moses wished for the&nbsp;Presence of the glory of the Lord to be manifest in the midst&nbsp;of the tens of thousands of families comprising the Jewish&nbsp;people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">רבבות</span><span class="font5">, this is one of the words that loses the prefix letter ב, such as we find the first time already in Exodus 31,17: כי&nbsp;ששת ימים, which we would have expected to be: כי בששת ימים,&nbsp;“for during six days.” The author quotes a number of such&nbsp;examples, singling out: Genesis 38,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the meaning of the line: קומה ה' ויפוצו אויביך, “arise O Lord so that Your enemies will&nbsp;scatter,” is the standard prayer we ought to recite whenever&nbsp;engaging on a journey. The line commencing with: 'שובה ה, is&nbsp;the prayer to let the traveler complete his journey without&nbsp;mishap, so that when counting his companions he will find&nbsp;that none were lost during the journey. The author quotes&nbsp;Deuteronomy 30,3, ושב ה' אלוקיך את שבותך, “and the Lord your&nbsp;G’w will return with your captives, etc.,” to support his view.&nbsp;The word ושוב there is to be understood as if Moses had&nbsp;said: והשיב, “He will bring back.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,1 כמתאוננים</span><span class="font5">, “as murmurers;” the word is related to און and עמל, “as in Jeremiah 4,14: מחשבות אונך</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“your evil&nbsp;designs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'וישמע ה</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord heard;” He heard that they uttered complaints and dissatisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותבער בהם אש</span><span class="font5">, “and the Lord’s fire raged among them;” this was a punishment fitting the crime, as they had dared to&nbsp;look at the glory of the Lord which is also known as fire, i.e.&nbsp;אש אוכלת, Exodus 24,17. They had already been warned not&nbsp;to do this in Exodus chapter 24. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explained this in&nbsp;connection with Exodus 24,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותאכל בקצה המחנה</span><span class="font5">, “and it devoured at the outer edges of the camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תבערה</span><span class="font5">, “punitive fire by the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'והאספסוף אשר בקרבו התאוו תאוה וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and the mixed&nbsp;multitude that were amongst the people, etc.” everything&nbsp;written here until the beginning of verse 30 when Moses&nbsp;selects the elders who are to assist him, occurred during the&nbsp;first three days after the people had moved away from Mount&nbsp;Sinai. The letter א (though silent anyways) is not read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישובו ויבכו גם בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “and in due course even the elite of the people, the בני ישראל, also joined the weeping of&nbsp;discontent that had been started by the mixed multitude. This&nbsp;is when they expressed their urge to be given meat to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">!מי יאכילנו בשר, </span><span class="font5">“if only someone would feed us meat!” The quails which had materialized on the evening before the&nbsp;manna started its daily appearance (Exodus 16,13) had&nbsp;come to an end some time ago. From this verse we&nbsp;understand the substance of the people’s complaint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זכרנו את הדגה</span><span class="font5">, “we remember now the fish, etc.”&nbsp;when the Nile overflows its banks and irrigates the fields of&nbsp;the Egyptians who had dug narrow canals to absorb these&nbsp;waters, and the water eventually retreats again, it leaves&nbsp;behind little fish in the indentations in the soil, and the wives&nbsp;of the Israelites would scoop these up and use as food. This&nbsp;could be done without effort, and the women who had come&nbsp;equipped with bowls or flasks could keep these fish alive for&nbsp;quite some time. Our sages have explained this to us. (No&nbsp;source quoted)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר נאכל במצרים חנם, </span><span class="font5">“which we used to eat in Egypt without having to pay for it.” (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את הקשואים ואת האבטיחים</span><span class="font5">, “the cucumbers and the melons;” these would be eaten as dessert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת החציר ואת הבצלים</span><span class="font5">, “as well as the leeks and the onions;” these would be used in the cooking pots to provide&nbsp;seasoning for the food to be boiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת השומים</span><span class="font5">, “and the garlic,” for making the food tasty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועתה נפשנו יבשה</span><span class="font5">, “and now our soul is dried up;”&nbsp;they were afraid that seeing that the manna was absorbed by&nbsp;their bodies entirely, none of it being waste to be excreted,&nbsp;that this would so interfere with their intestinal organs that it&nbsp;would kill them internally. They did not understand how a&nbsp;human being born from the womb of a woman can survive on&nbsp;food such as the manna alone. They challenged Rabbi&nbsp;Shimon by asking: “what is it that keeps you alive?” Is it not&nbsp;the excrement which is described in the Torah in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deuteronomy 23,14: ויתד תהיה לך על אזנך, “and have a paddle with you to cover your excrement!” (Torah addressing the&nbsp;Jewish soldier) The Rabbi answered the questioners that&nbsp;what is excreted are only the contributions to food provided&nbsp;by the gentiles. None of the manna needs to be excreted as&nbsp;it originated in the heavenly spheres where there is no&nbsp;useless or harmful substance. Scriptural proof for this is to be&nbsp;found in when David said in Psalms 78,25: לחם אבירים אכל&nbsp;איש, “each man ate a hero’s meal.” The type of man who can&nbsp;thrive on manna is the one who deserves the title אבירים.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: if the people had become spiritually flawed, they would find that some of the manna&nbsp;turned into excrement within them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והמן כזרע גד</span><span class="font5">, “and the manna was like coriander&nbsp;seed;” the letter כ has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik,</span><span class="font5"> and the letter ז has&nbsp;the semi vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh”va.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שטו העם ולקטו</span><span class="font5">, “the people would leave the camp&nbsp;and collect;” the word שטו is familiar to us from Job 1,7 שוט,&nbsp;“roaming.” According to a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">midrash</span><span class="font5"> found in the Talmud,&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 75, the line: שטו העם ולקטו, refers to the&nbsp;righteous Israelites who were eating the manna while it was&nbsp;descending through the atmosphere. They did not even have&nbsp;to bother to leave their homes and to collect it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטחנו בריחים או דכו במדוכה</span><span class="font5">, “they ground it in a mill, or pounded it in mortars;” this refers to the average Israelite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובשלו בפרוד</span><span class="font5">, “or they boiled in pots.” According to that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">midrash,</span><span class="font5"> this refers to the relatively wicked Israelites, who&nbsp;had to spend more time and effort to make the manna&nbsp;palatable for themselves. This is also why the Torah reports&nbsp;in Numbers 15,32, that the Israelites found a man gathering&nbsp;kindling on the Sabbath. He was a sinner and wanted to boil&nbsp;the manna on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,11. ולמה לא מצתי חן</span><span class="font5">, “and why have I not found favour, etc.?” The word מצתי is one which on occasion is&nbsp;spelled without the letter א when that letter is the last root&nbsp;letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,12. האנכי הריתי</span><span class="font5">, “was it I who has conceived these people?” Am I their mother who had conceived them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אם אנכי ילידתיהו</span><span class="font5">, “did I sire them?” Was I their father? The root ילד has been used in this sense in Genesis 10,24.&nbsp;(Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על האדמה, </span><span class="font5">not “on the earth,” but as in אל האדמה “on to the earth.” Compare Genesis 38,12, על גוזזי צאן</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">to the&nbsp;shearing of the sheep.” Compare also Exodus 10,21: נטה ידך&nbsp;על השמים, not “incline your hand over the heaven,” but “incline&nbsp;your hand in the direction of the heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא אוכל אנכי לבדי</span><span class="font5">, “I cannot all by myself, etc.”&nbsp;Moses had said all this </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> the fire of G’d had burned&nbsp;against all the officers in the camp, seeing that as long as&nbsp;these had still been alive, they had shared the burden of&nbsp;leading the people with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם ככה את עושה לי</span><span class="font5">, “and if You will deal with me&nbsp;in this fashion;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Moses had felt that he&nbsp;had become weak like a woman, so that he was not even&nbsp;able to complete the last word, (which should have been: אתה&nbsp;in the masculine mode). He was full of psychological pain&nbsp;and anger, so that he addressed G’d as if he were&nbsp;addressing a human being and runs out of breath before&nbsp;being able to complete a sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other commentators understand the word: את here as if vocalised with a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">segol,</span><span class="font5"> similar to בך, or לך, which can be used&nbsp;both in the masculine and in the feminine mode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואל אראה ברעתי</span><span class="font5">, “so that I will no longer have to deal with the evil that has befallen me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אספה לי שבעים איש</span><span class="font5">, “gather for me seventy men;”&nbsp;the number 70 is symbolic of the original seventy Israelites&nbsp;that left the land of Canaan to go to Egypt, as well as the&nbsp;seventy elders that were the leaders of the people at the time&nbsp;of the revelation at Mount Sinai. (Exodus 24,1) It also&nbsp;symbolises the seventy families mentioned in the census&nbsp;reported in Numbers chapter 26, as well as the members of&nbsp;the Supreme Court, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin,</span><span class="font5"> excluding its president, in&nbsp;later Jewish history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואצלתי מן הרוח אשר עליך</span><span class="font5">, “and I will enhance some&nbsp;of the spirit that is part of you;” did G’d not have holy spirit&nbsp;that He could have taken from somewhere else other than&nbsp;Moses? We therefore must understand G’d’s words as&nbsp;follows: He told Moses that that he should judge the Jewish&nbsp;people and that He had given him sufficient wisdom to know&nbsp;how to this. How could Moses therefore complain that he&nbsp;could not do it by himself? (verse 14) If so, it was proof that&nbsp;he, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Moses,</span><span class="font5"> had to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">share</span><span class="font5"> some of his holy spirit with the&nbsp;elders he would now appoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,18. התקדשו למחר</span><span class="font5">, “sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, (the 23<sup>rd</sup> of lyar) (see our author’s commentary&nbsp;on verse 4 in this chapter)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עד חדש ימים</span><span class="font5">, “as long as a whole month.” The last&nbsp;day of that month was not included in the period that G’d is&nbsp;speaking of. According to the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Taanit</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;29, the last day of that period would be the 23<sup>rd</sup> of Sivan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה לכם לזרא</span><span class="font5">, “it will become loathsome for you.” The Torah substituted the letter א at the end of this word, where&nbsp;we would have expected the letter ה. There are other&nbsp;examples of this in the Bible, such as Ruth 1,20 קראן לי מרא,&nbsp;“call me the embittered one,” where we also would have&nbsp;expected the author to have written: מרה. The meaning of the&nbsp;word לזרא, is: להסיג, to remove, to vomit. Isaiah uses that&nbsp;expression in Isaiah 1,4 נזורו אחור, when describing the&nbsp;Jewish people’s moral turpitude by having turned their back&nbsp;on G’d and His commandments. We find it also in Numbers&nbsp;17,2: as an imperative: זרה הלאה, “scatter it! (the destructive&nbsp;glowing coals on his pan containing incense).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d commands the people to gorge themselves on the meat so much so that in the end it will become repugnant to&nbsp;them, no longer an object of their desire. Eventually, they will&nbsp;vomit it in disgust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאמור למה זה יצאנו ממצרים</span><span class="font5">, because you had the nerve to say: “why did we ever agree to leave Egypt?” G’d refers to&nbsp;the people having yearned for the fish they ate in Egypt&nbsp;without having to work or pay for. (verse 5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ויאמר משה: שש מאות אלף רגלי וגו</span><span class="font5">, “Moses said:&nbsp;there are six hundred adult infantry soldiers, etc.” Moses is&nbsp;overwhelmed by the intended undertaking of G’d to supply&nbsp;such a vast number of human beings suddenly with meat to&nbsp;which they had absolutely no claim, by his appointing&nbsp;seventy elders to help him govern such a nation. He cannot&nbsp;understand why, on the one hand, G’d had told him to&nbsp;appoint for himself 70 people to help him govern such a stiffnecked people, and on the other hand, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">reward</span><span class="font5"> them by&nbsp;performing such a miracle for them at the same time. He is&nbsp;under the mistaken impression that these seventy men&nbsp;should act as the slaughterers for such a large number of&nbsp;people. How could even seventy slaughterers supply meat&nbsp;for about three million people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.22</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הצאן ובקר </span><span class="font5">shall sheep and cattle be slaughtered?&nbsp;(seeing that they had asked for meat)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואם כל דגי הים</span><span class="font5">, “or shall all the fish in the ocean (be caught)? (seeing they had recalled the fish they had eaten in&nbsp;Egypt with such nostalgia)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ישחט להם...יאסף להם, </span><span class="font5">“be either slaughtered for them, or caught for them?” Shall all of this be done by a mere seventy&nbsp;people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומצא להם</span><span class="font5">, “where could all this even be found, never mind slaughtered, in order to feed them for a whole month?!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.23. ויאמר ה' אל משה: היד ה' תקצר</span><span class="font5">, The Lord said to Moses: “is the Lord’s power inadequate?” G’d implied that it&nbsp;had not been His intention for one moment to use the&nbsp;seventy helpers Moses would appoint as slaughterers or&nbsp;fishermen. Neither would He have to resort to overt miracles.&nbsp;All He had to do was to direct the flight of a swarm of birds in&nbsp;their direction. He was fully capable to do this within the&nbsp;boundaries of existing laws of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עתה תראה היקרך דברי אם לא</span><span class="font5">, “now you will see if My word will come true or not.” “I will provide, but not as you had&nbsp;thought by employing these seventy men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,25. ויאצל מן הרוח</span><span class="font5">, “He diverted from the holy spirit” (of&nbsp;Moses) the letter א in the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויאצל</span><span class="font5">, though written in the&nbsp;Torah, is not heard when read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויתנבאו ולא יספו</span><span class="font5">, “they prophesied;” but they did not continue to do so with the help of Moses. The word: יספו is to&nbsp;be understand as if the Torah had written “they added,” the&nbsp;word is used in this sense also Leviticus 5,7 ויסף חמישתו עליו </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5">he will have to add a fifth of it in addition</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,26.וישארו שני אנשים</span><span class="font5">, there were two men in addition to the seventy men. (Moses had put 72 pieces of parchment in&nbsp;an urn, 6 for each tribe, of which two bore no inscription so&nbsp;that the men drawing those would know they were not part of&nbsp;the seventy elders). In other words: “they were redundant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שם האחד אלדד ושם השני מידד</span><span class="font5">, “one of these two men was called Eldod, and the other was called Meydod.” The seventy&nbsp;elders were never mentioned by name whereas these two&nbsp;men who at first glance appeared as rejects, were named.&nbsp;The reason is that the prophetic spirit bestowed on the&nbsp;seventy elders ceased when Moses died, whereas the&nbsp;prophetic powers granted to these men survived Moses, as&nbsp;their prophetic powers was not a branch of Moses’ holy spirit.&nbsp;G’d Himself had said that He would give some of Moses’&nbsp;spirit to these 70 elders (verse 17) The two named men&nbsp;received their prophetic spirit from G’d directly, as stated in&nbsp;our verse with the words: ותנח עליהם </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">הרוח</span><span class="font5">, “and the spirit&nbsp;rested upon them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותנח עליהם הרוח</span><span class="font5">, although these men had not been chosen to become part of the seventy elders, seeing that&nbsp;they were fit to have been elders and they did not feel&nbsp;humbled or rejected by not being chosen, they were&nbsp;rewarded by being given greater and longer lasting prophetic&nbsp;insights that the seventy whose parchment had read: “elder.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והמה בכתובים</span><span class="font5">, “they were amongst the seventy who had not drawn blanks.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> this means that they&nbsp;had been included in the seventy two parchments on 70 of&nbsp;which Moses had written the word: “elder” and two of which&nbsp;he had left blank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask that this method would have resulted in a great deal of jealousy by the ones who had not drawn a&nbsp;parchment with the word “elder,” it is therefore more&nbsp;reasonable to suppose that those who took parchments out&nbsp;of the urn early on would argue that they had a better chance&nbsp;not to draw a blank as 70 out of 72 were not blanks. Each&nbsp;one pushed in order not to be one of the last two whose&nbsp;chance of drawing a blank was so much greater. This was&nbsp;faulty reasoning, as the chance that the blanks would be&nbsp;drawn by the “early birds” was just as great as the reverse,&nbsp;and in fact, as soon as the blanks had been drawn the&nbsp;remaining candidates already knew for certain that they&nbsp;could not draw a blank. [It is therefore more likely that the&nbsp;Torah wishes us to know that in order to avoid jealousy,&nbsp;these two men decided to withdraw out of humility, so that&nbsp;the other 70 could all become elders. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They accomplished this by not showing up at the entrance to the Tabernacle as the men who drew&nbsp;parchments with the word: “elder” had been told to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יצאו האהלה</span><span class="font5">, “but they had not gone out to the Tabernacle’s entrance;” they had not left the general camp to&nbsp;follow the other elders to the Tabernacle with their&nbsp;colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויתנבאו במחנה</span><span class="font5">, ‘they prophesied inside the camp of the Israelites. Concerning what subject did these two men make&nbsp;prophetic announcements? They prophesied concerning the&nbsp;eventual war against Gog, and concerning the prophet&nbsp;Ezekiel. We find a hint of the subject of their prophecies in&nbsp;Ezekiel 38,17: כה אמר ה' האתה הוא אשר דברתי בימים קדמונים ביד&nbsp;הנביאים שנים, “you are the one I spoke of in ancient times&nbsp;through My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied&nbsp;in those years about you and about Gog;” instead of reading&nbsp;the word שנים to mean: ”years,” understand it to mean: “שניים,&nbsp;two.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,28. מבחוריו</span><span class="font5">, “from his early youth.” We find this word&nbsp;having this meaning also in Kohelet 12,1: בימי בחורתיך, “in the&nbsp;days of your youth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of this word: “from amongst the choicest to serve Moses,” for there were others with him.&nbsp;(Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אדוני משה כלאם</span><span class="font5">, “my lord Moses lock them up!” Joshua wanted these two men put under house arrest so that their&nbsp;prophecies would not become public. The other seventy men&nbsp;who had also displayed prophetic insights had done so only&nbsp;in the relative privacy of the sacred precincts of the&nbsp;Tabernacle which was out of bounds to the people at large.&nbsp;They had done so only in the presence of Moses. (verse 16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Eldod and Meydod had not asked for permission to prophesy publicly, and had prophesied outside the sacred&nbsp;precincts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.29. ומי ימן כל עם ה׳ נביאים</span><span class="font5">, “would that all the Lord’s people were prophets!” Moses did not care if they would&nbsp;prophesy in the camp or only in the sacred precincts around&nbsp;the Tabernacle, as long as they would make his task easier&nbsp;to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי ימן ה׳ את רוחו עליהם</span><span class="font5">, “as long as G’d directly would bestow His holy spirit upon them!” He wanted them to&nbsp;receive holy spirit from G’d directly, not only as a part of the&nbsp;holy spirit that had been bestowed upon him. He realised that&nbsp;the seventy men had received only part of the Holy spirit that&nbsp;he had been endowed with, and that this Holy spirit would&nbsp;vanish as soon as he would die. He therefore prayed that&nbsp;they would receive permanent Holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאסף משה אל המחנה</span><span class="font5">, Moses withdrew to the&nbsp;camp;” he was accompanied by the seventy elders now as&nbsp;he wished to show them honour in public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ורוח נסע</span><span class="font5">, “a wind went forth, etc.;” this occurred&nbsp;on the twenty third of lyar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויגז שלוים מן הים</span><span class="font5">, “it brought across quails from the sea;” this was how G’d fulfilled His promise to provide meat for all&nbsp;the people, enough for them to gorge themselves on for a&nbsp;whole month, in response to their longing for the fish they&nbsp;had eaten in Egypt without having had to pay for them.(verse&nbsp;5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על המחנה</span><span class="font5">, next to the camp; the word על here is used as in Exodus 40,3;וסכות על הארון ,”you will spread it </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">next to</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;Holy Ark, or as in Leviticus 24,7: ונתת על המערכת, “you shall&nbsp;place it </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">next to</span><span class="font5"> the row.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכאממים על פני הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “and to a height of approximately two cubits above the ground.” The quails had been flying in&nbsp;formations over each other above the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאספו את השלו</span><span class="font5">, “they gathered up the quails</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">The letter י is missing in the word השלו.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עשרה חמרים</span><span class="font5">, “ten heaps;” a “heap” is equivalent to thirty </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sa-ah,</span><span class="font5"> the latter being approximately 13000 ccm., so that the&nbsp;ones who collected the least amount would have collected&nbsp;ten </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sa-ah</span><span class="font5"> per day during the thirty day period involved in this&nbsp;episode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.33. הבשר עודנו בין שניהם</span><span class="font5">, “while the meat was still between their teeth etc.;” the negative effect was delayed&nbsp;until the whole people had been provided with sufficient&nbsp;meat, so none would be able to say that they were only&nbsp;stricken because G’d was not able to provide sufficient meat&nbsp;for all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרא את שם המקום קברות התאוה</span><span class="font5">, “he called the&nbsp;name of this place: graves of lust.” The Torah did not identify&nbsp;who it was who bestowed this name on these graves, just as&nbsp;we find that in Genesis 48,1 we do not know who told Joseph&nbsp;that his father had been taken sick, i.e. ויאמר ליוסף, “someone&nbsp;called Joseph.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מקברות התאוה נסעו</span><span class="font5">, “from that place they&nbsp;continued journeying, etc.” this was on the twenty second&nbsp;day of the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהיו החצרות</span><span class="font5">, “they remained at Chatzerot for some time.” We would have expected the Torah to have written: ויחנו&nbsp;בחצרות, “they made camp at Chatzerot,” as it did when&nbsp;reporting on all the other places where the people made&nbsp;camp. The reason why there was a change here was that the&nbsp;Torah wished us to know that their departure from Chatzerot&nbsp;had been delayed because Miriam had spoken critically of&nbsp;her brother Moses, and when having been punished with&nbsp;skin eczema, the people waited until she had been healed.&nbsp;This is another example of the Torah not having reported&nbsp;events in their chronological order. Part of the people had&nbsp;already moved on during that episode, but they turned back&nbsp;after finding out what had occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,1. ותדבר מרים ואהרן במשה</span><span class="font5">, “Miriam and Aaron spoke out critically against Moses;” how did either of them know&nbsp;that Moses had separated from his wife? They had both&nbsp;noted that Tzipporah no longer wore the jewelry she had&nbsp;been in the habit of wearing. Miriam asked Tzipporah why&nbsp;she no longer wore that jewelry. Tzipporah replied that it was&nbsp;because Miriam’s brother (Moses) did not pay any attention&nbsp;to her jewelry. This was a hint that he had separated from&nbsp;her. She told Aaron about this and they talked about that&nbsp;situation criticizing him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על אודות האשה הכושית</span><span class="font5">, they wondered why Moses had chosen this point in time to separate from Tzipporah and&nbsp;concluded that it was because she was a Negress (ugly),&nbsp;and they could not understand that he had married her in the&nbsp;first place seeing that she had always been a Negress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of this line: She had been a queen in her land, the land of Kush. This would fit with what&nbsp;we have read in Chronicles that Moses had been a King in&nbsp;that land. At the time, he had to marry a local woman. Now&nbsp;there was no need for him to remain married to a Kushite&nbsp;woman. If this were correct, our verse would not refer to&nbsp;Tzipporah, for the line: “for he had married a Kushite&nbsp;woman,” would not make any sense as Tzipporah was a&nbsp;Midianite woman as we know from Exodus 2,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Kushites were descended from Cham, the third son of Noach, and as such were a cursed people, and a Jew&nbsp;would not have married a woman from a cursed nation&nbsp;[although, Keturah, Avraham’s second and last wife, was an&nbsp;Egyptian and therefore also from a cursed nation, as&nbsp;Mitzrayim was the second son of Cham, Kush having been&nbsp;his firstborn (Genesis 10,6) Midian himself was a son of&nbsp;Keturah an Egyptian (Genesis 25,2), and therefore&nbsp;descendant of a cursed nation. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,2. ויאמרו הרק אך במשה דבר</span><span class="font5">, “did G’d then speak exclusively to Moses?” We have a rule in the Hebrew&nbsp;language that when restrictive clauses such as “only,” or&nbsp;“exclusively,” follow one another consecutively, they are&nbsp;meant to add something instead of to subtract something. In&nbsp;this instance we have two such clauses following one&nbsp;another, i.e. רק and אך. The addition follows promptly by&nbsp;Miriam adding that G’d had spoken to them, i.e. herself and&nbsp;to her brother Aaron also, so that they too were prophets.&nbsp;(The Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah</span><span class="font5"> folio 14, and tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 12 claims that Miriam had prophesied even before&nbsp;Moses had been born.) Concerning Aaron prophesying, the&nbsp;reader is referred to Samuel I 2,27, as interpreted by Sh’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">’mot&nbsp;Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 3,21.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'וישמע ה </span><span class="font5">“the Lord heard;” even though Miriam and Aaron had this conversation completely privately, and no one&nbsp;overheard them, G’d was privy to it, and He would demand&nbsp;that Moses’ integrity be defended. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר ה' פתאום</span><span class="font5">, “suddenly the Lord spoke up;” He&nbsp;did so in order that Aaron and Miriam would not blame&nbsp;Moses for having complained about him to G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרא אהרן ומרים</span><span class="font5">, “He called Aaron and Miriam’” He&nbsp;did not invite Moses to become part of this conversation. He&nbsp;did not want the Israelites to say that G’d had been angry at&nbsp;Moses also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;במראה אליו אתודע, </span><span class="font5">“I make Myself known to him as&nbsp;a prophetic </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">vision</span><span class="font5">. The word מראה here is used in the same&nbsp;sense as in Numbers 23,3; ודבר מה יראני והגדתי לך, “and&nbsp;whatever He will show me I will tell you about.” (Bileam to&nbsp;Balak)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בכל ביתי נאמן הוא</span><span class="font5">, “he is trusted in all My house.”&nbsp;The world at large knows that Moses has seen things that&nbsp;have not been shown to any other prophets. This is because&nbsp;he is the “father,” i.e. prototype of all prophets past present or&nbsp;future. In Proverbs 11,13, Solomon said of Moses: נאמן רוח&nbsp;מכסה דבר, “a faithful spirit keeps a confidence.” The Jerusalem&nbsp;Targum translates that phrase with the words: “in My whole&nbsp;house, among My whole people.” All of My people young and&nbsp;old simple and learned, are aware that Moses keeps&nbsp;absolute faith with G’d, and does not reveal anything he has&nbsp;not been told to reveal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותמונת ה' יביט </span><span class="font5">“and he is allowed to see a visual&nbsp;image of the Lord.” G’d does not refer to a frontal image, but&nbsp;to a rear view as stated in Exodus 33,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.9. ויחר אף ה' בם, </span><span class="font5">“and the anger of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> was kindled against them;” according to some commentators&nbsp;Aaron was also smitten with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat;”</span><span class="font5"> (to account for the&nbsp;word: בם, “against them”) Another sage holds that G’d&nbsp;contented Himself with being angry at Aaron without taking&nbsp;any action against him. (Compare Talmud in tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 97)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,10. והענן סר והנה מרים מצורעת</span><span class="font5">, “when the cloud had cleared, Miriam had been struck with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat”.</span><span class="font5"> It is not&nbsp;seemly for the holy cloud of G’d to remains next to a ritually&nbsp;impure person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל נא תהי כמת</span><span class="font5">, “do not let her be like a dead&nbsp;person.” Anyone suffering from this skin disease is&nbsp;considered as if dead. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nedarim</span><span class="font5"> folio 64)&nbsp;What Aaron meant was that his sister should not be like a&nbsp;newly born infant that displays signs of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> and therefore&nbsp;is considered as if stillborn. We have a statement: “when a&nbsp;youngster is born afflicted with the disease of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> he will&nbsp;never attain ritual purity.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span><span class="font5"> Seeing that this&nbsp;affliction is attributed to a specific sin, it may be healed as a&nbsp;result of a prayer, as we know from when Pharaoh was&nbsp;healed from this affliction in response to Avraham’s prayer.&nbsp;(Genesis 12,17) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments here that Moses implied&nbsp;that seeing that Miriam and he emerged from the same&nbsp;womb, how could he be expected to tolerate that his other&nbsp;half be “as dead?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל נא רפא נא לה</span><span class="font5">, “Heal her now, I beseech you,&nbsp;G’d!” the first word נא is to be understood as a request. The&nbsp;second time it is used, it appeals for immediate action by&nbsp;G’d. Proof of this is the fact that G’d’s reply explains why G’d&nbsp;cannot fulfill Moses’ second request. The minimum period&nbsp;time Miriam has to suffer from this affliction is one whole day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הלא תכלא שבעת ימים</span><span class="font5">, “would she not be banned&nbsp;for at least seven days?” G’d refers to such a daughter not&nbsp;being allowed to look at her father’s face as a sign of her&nbsp;shame. We find an example of this in the life of Avshalom,&nbsp;son of David, (Samuel II 13, 37-39) Here we are dealing with&nbsp;two sins Miriam had committed, one against G’d and one&nbsp;against Moses; G’d had spelled it out when He said: בעבדי&nbsp;במשה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“against My servant, against Moses.” Accordingly, if</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d were to apply a strict yardstick, Miriam would have to be ostracised at least for two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מחוץ למחנה שבעת ימים</span><span class="font5">, “seven days outside the camp.” Not seven whole days, but the seventh day would be&nbsp;accounted as a whole day as our author had already&nbsp;explained once on Leviticus 13,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,16. ואחר, </span><span class="font5">“and afterwards;” after Miriam returned to&nbsp;the camp on the twenty ninth day of Sivan</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחנו במדבר פארן</span><span class="font5">, “they made camp in the desert around Paran.” This is a reference to Kadesh Barnea, (as we know,&nbsp;the place from which the spies were dispatched)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sequence of events was as follows: on the 20<sup>th</sup> of Iyar the people arrived at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kivrot ha-ta-avah,</span><span class="font5"> after having&nbsp;journeyed from Mount Sinai on that day. G’d had not told&nbsp;them to sanctify themselves until the following day, until the&nbsp;22<sup>nd</sup> of the month. Concerning this period the Torah had&nbsp;written: “they journeyed from Mount Sinai a distance of three&nbsp;days.” The reason we need to know all this is in order to&nbsp;know that when the spies returned with a devastating report,&nbsp;resulting in a whole generation being condemned to die in&nbsp;the desert, the date was the 9<sup>th</sup> of Av, a date to become&nbsp;infamous for many tragic events in Jewish history. The&nbsp;episode of the quails lasted exactly a whole month the last&nbsp;day being included, so that it ended on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of Sivan. On&nbsp;that day the people arrived at Chatzerot. They remained&nbsp;there until Miriam had been healed, on the seventh day, i.e.&nbsp;the 29<sup>th</sup> day of Sivan. On the following day the first day of&nbsp;Tammuz, the spies were sent of, as stated in the Talmud,&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Taanit</span><span class="font5"> folio 29.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Sh’lach-l’cha</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תשלחו כל נשיא בהם, </span><span class="font5">“send them, each one of these&nbsp;men being a prince in his own right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כלם אנשים</span><span class="font5">, “all of them distinguished personalities;”&nbsp;according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> at the time when they were charged with&nbsp;their mission they were all deserving of having been chosen&nbsp;for this task. They underwent a change of heart only after&nbsp;having been selected. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points this out when&nbsp;commenting on the words: וילכו-ויבאו, “they went forth-they&nbsp;arrived,” in verse 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ראשי בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “heads of the Children of Israel.”&nbsp;Each one of them was at least a head of a thousand&nbsp;|sraelites. [There were 600 like that Ed]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,6. כלב בן יפונה</span><span class="font5">, “Caleb son of Yefuneh.” He is identical&nbsp;with Caleb son of Chetzron, and the reason he is here called&nbsp;the son of Yefuneh, is because he turned aside (</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פנה</span><span class="font5">) from all&nbsp;but one of the other spies. [Chetzron had been a grandson of&nbsp;Yehudah, Genesis 46,12, compare also Chronicles I 2,18.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,11. למטה יוסף, למטה מנשה</span><span class="font5">, “of the tribe of Joseph, i.e. the tribe of Menashe.” Even though on numerous occasions&nbsp;the tribe of Joseph is equated with the tribe of Ephrayim&nbsp;(seeing that Yaakov had told Joseph that he outranked&nbsp;Menashe the older), here Joseph and Menashe are paired,&nbsp;seeing that both had become guilty of slander. Joseph had&nbsp;slandered his brothers to his father, and the prince of&nbsp;Menashe had slandered the land of Israel. There are several&nbsp;instances where Joseph and Menashe are equated precisely&nbsp;because the context of the story supports that interpretation.&nbsp;(Compare Numbers 34,23, Joshua 17,1) In Joshua 17, the&nbsp;subject is the distribution of the land to the various tribes, and&nbsp;it was these lands that the prince of Menashe had slandered&nbsp;in joining the majority report of the spies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,16. אלה שמות האנשים</span><span class="font5">. “the following are the names of these 12 men: no representative of the tribe of Levi had been&nbsp;included amongst the spies, as the members of that tribe&nbsp;were not going to get fields to work as ancestral lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקרא משה להושע בן נון יהושע, </span><span class="font5">“Moses renamed Hoshea bin Nun as Joshua. The Torah does not mean that Moses&nbsp;renamed Hoshea at this time; we have to understand this&nbsp;verse as follows: Moses had renamed Hoshea from the time&nbsp;he had appointed him as his personal valet. The Torah&nbsp;merely wishes to tell us that the Joshua whom Moses has&nbsp;appointed as one of the spies, was the one whom he had&nbsp;renamed at the time of his previous appointment as Moses’&nbsp;personal servant, seeing that at that time already he had&nbsp;found favour in his eyes, and he wanted to express this by&nbsp;adding a letter to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We know that G’d had renamed Avram after he had found favour in his eyes by adding a letter to his name, just&nbsp;as He had changed a letter in Sarai’s name for a similar&nbsp;reason. Both Yaakov and Joseph experienced name&nbsp;changes, as did Daniel and the last King of Yehudah,&nbsp;Matnaya, whom Nebuchadnezzar renamed Tzedekiah. Also&nbsp;Nechemyah, underwent such a name change as we know&nbsp;from Nechemyah 8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,17. עלו זה בנגב</span><span class="font5">, “ascend from this point in the south!”&nbsp;Kadesh was at the southernmost part of the land of Israel.&nbsp;(Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועליתם את ההר</span><span class="font5">, “and climb up into the mountains.” Once you have seen the land from the mountains, it will be easier&nbsp;to conquer its lowlands. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם רעה</span><span class="font5">, “or if it is bad;” if the land is pleasant&nbsp;(climate-wise). or if its waters are bad and cause&nbsp;bereavement. In reply to these questions the spies upon&nbsp;returning, answered Moses that the land devoured its&nbsp;inhabitants. (verse 32).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והתחזקתם</span><span class="font5">, “be of good courage.” They needed to&nbsp;be on their guard, seeing that it was the beginning of the&nbsp;harvest season and the farmers would watch their crops&nbsp;against thieves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ממדבר צין עד רחוב לבא חמת</span><span class="font5">, “from the desert of Tzin&nbsp;in the south, as far north as the approaches to Chamat.”&nbsp;They crossed the country diagonally from south to North, and&nbsp;from North to South. A verse that we read in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Massey&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">confirms this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">13.22.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויבא עד חברון</span><span class="font5">, “he came as far as Chevron;” we&nbsp;have a sudden switch from the plural mode to the singular&nbsp;mode, which raises the question of who it was that the Torah&nbsp;speaks of in this verse. Our sages understand this to be a&nbsp;reference to Caleb whom they credit with the urge to pay his&nbsp;respects to the graves of the patriarchs and his desire to get&nbsp;moral support against the negative attitude of most of his&nbsp;companions. This is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> interpretation. He felt the need&nbsp;to do this as Moses had not prayed for him especially, as he&nbsp;had done for his colleague Joshua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the line: “he came to Chevron:” it is customary for the Torah to apply the singular&nbsp;mode even when speaking about a number of spies or&nbsp;members of an ambush, as we know from Joshua 8,19&nbsp;where we read: והאורב קם ממקומו, “and the ambush (the men&nbsp;comprising it) arose from where it had been hiding.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושם אחימן</span><span class="font5">, the Torah mentions this giant by name as the spies later on in their report refer to descendants of a race of&nbsp;giants whom they had encountered, i.e. in verse 28, where&nbsp;we read: “we also saw a race of giants there.” The Torah&nbsp;wanted us to know where precisely the spies had come face&nbsp;to face with such people. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[All this is part of the peculiar fact that although the spies reported faithfully what they had seen and where, they&nbsp;drew the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">wrong</span><span class="font5"> conclusions from their observations. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחברון שבע שנים נבנתה לפני צוען מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “and the town Chevron had been built seven years earlier than the capital&nbsp;of Egypt, Tzoan.” The race of giants had not yet died out, as&nbsp;they had survived from earlier generations. The reason why&nbsp;this is of importance is to tell us that the conclusion drawn by&nbsp;the spies that the land of Canaan “consumes its inhabitants,”&nbsp;(verse 32) was contradicted by what they themselves&nbsp;reported as having seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לפני צוען מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “prior to Tzoan in Egypt.” The Torah reminds you of the importance of the land of Canaan,&nbsp;compared to the land of Egypt before they had emigrated&nbsp;from it. The spies had been aware of these historical facts,&nbsp;[and they should have concluded from this that the land of&nbsp;Canaan certainly does not “consume its inhabitants.” Ed.].</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,23. ויכרתו משם זמורה ואשכול</span><span class="font5">, “they cut from there a branch with a cluster of grapes.” From this little detail we are&nbsp;to learn two lessons, (i.e. from the letter ו at the beginning of&nbsp;the word אשכול</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">)</span><span class="font5">. They made a pole to carry the cluster by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישאוהו במוט בשנים</span><span class="font5">, “they bore it on a pole between the two of them. The pomegranates and the cluster of grapes&nbsp;were carried separately by different men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.25. מקץ ארבעים יום</span><span class="font5">, “at the end of forty days;” they had commenced their mission on the 29<sup>th</sup> day of Sivan, and&nbsp;concluded it on the 8<sup>th</sup> day of the month of Av close to&nbsp;evening. The month of Tammuz in that year had thirty days.&nbsp;(Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Taanit</span><span class="font5"> folio 29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל מדבר פארן קדשה, </span><span class="font5">to the desert of Paran, toward&nbsp;Kadesh.” The desert of Paran, the desert of Tzin, Kadesh&nbsp;Barnea, and Ritma, were all very near one another. All this is&nbsp;clear from Numbers 33,18, as well as verse 36 there.&nbsp;Compare also Numbers 32,8.</span></p><h1 dir="rtl"><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font5">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אפס כי עז העם היושב בארץ והערים בצורות גדולות .13,28</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">however, “</span><span class="font5">the people are very fierce, and the cities are fortified and great;” they described two major drawbacks to&nbsp;the assumptions that these people were easy to dislodge. In&nbsp;addition to this, they spoke of the giants they had seen, וגם&nbsp;ילידי ענק ראינו שם, “and we have also seen the children of&nbsp;Anak (a giant) there.” We have read in Deuteronomy 9,2, that&nbsp;Moses reminded the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">new</span><span class="font5"> generation of Israelites that they&nbsp;had heard about the awesome reputation of these giants&nbsp;already from their parents who had described them as&nbsp;invincible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,29. עמלק יושב בארץ הנגב</span><span class="font5">, “the Amalekites reside in the southern region of that land.” The spies implied that before&nbsp;asking about the fierceness of the inhabitants of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font5"> land&nbsp;further north, they should first ask about the Amalekites who&nbsp;live near the southern border, the area slated for invasion&nbsp;first. This was the same Amalek whom their fathers had not&nbsp;been able to completely defeat when they had just come out&nbsp;of Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואמורי יושב בהר</span><span class="font5">, “and the Emorites dwell in the mountainous regions. The Canaanites dwell along the shores&nbsp;of the Sea, as well as along the river Jordan. They meant&nbsp;that there was no unpopulated region through which to enter&nbsp;this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,30. ויהס כלב את העם אל משה</span><span class="font5">, “Caleb silenced the people toward Moses;” From this line you can glean what&nbsp;must have been left out here, i.e. that Moses was trying&nbsp;unsuccessfully to interrupt the report of the spies, until Caleb&nbsp;succeeded to silence them, even if only briefly. 38 years later&nbsp;in Deuteronomy 1,29, Moses reminds the people that he had&nbsp;tried to give them encouragement to proceed with carrying&nbsp;out G’d’s command to mount an attack against the&nbsp;inhabitants of that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,33</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושם ראינו את הנפילים</span><span class="font5">, “and there we have seen the Nephilim; some commentators believe that these people&nbsp;were very tall people who had fallen out of the sky, as in Job&nbsp;14,18 הר נופל יבול, “mountains collapse and crumble,” where&nbsp;the words describe a great height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בני ענק</span><span class="font5">, according to one opinion cited by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the necks of these people reached almost to the sun.&nbsp;(Exaggeration, of course). The spies, referring to themselves&nbsp;add that they therefore felt as if they were as small as&nbsp;grasshoppers by comparison. This is not the only example&nbsp;where small creatures are compared to grasshoppers.&nbsp;Compare Isaiah 40,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,3. !הלא טוב לנו לשוב מצרימה</span><span class="font5">, “would it not be better for us to return to Egypt!” When an Israelite died in Egypt, at&nbsp;least he had someone to leave his estate to either to&nbsp;children, relatives, or at least to friends. Who could he leave&nbsp;it to in the desert? It would all go to the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,8. 'אם חפץ בנו ה</span><span class="font5">, “if </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> had really been fond of us, He would not allow us to die in the desert.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,9. </span><span class="font5">(Joshua and Caleb speaking</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">) כי לחמנו הם </span><span class="font5">, “they are just as if our bread, ready to be consumed. This&nbsp;expression describing enemies as if already utterly defeated,&nbsp;is based on Deuteronomy 7,16: ואכלת את כל העמים “you will&nbsp;consume all the nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">סר צלם מעליהם</span><span class="font5">, “their protective shadow has already been removed from them. The Torah describes any “shield,”&nbsp;intended to protect as צל, “shadow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אכנו בדבר ואורישנו</span><span class="font5">, “I will strike them with a&nbsp;pestilence and destroy them. G’d intended to do this so that&nbsp;no enemy will be able to boast that he has defeated G’d’s&nbsp;people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.13. כי העלית</span><span class="font5">, “although You have brought them up,&nbsp;etc.;” according to our author, the meaning of the word כי&nbsp;here is the same as the word אשר, “which or whom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואמרו, </span><span class="font5">“and the Egyptians will say, etc,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל יושבי הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “to the inhabitants of this land, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What are they going to tell them? Because of G’d’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">inability, etc.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,17. 'יגדל נא כח ה</span><span class="font5">, “let the power of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> be great!” Moses prays that G’d’s attribute of Mercy be more powerful&nbsp;than His attribute of Justice; the source of this argument is&nbsp;found in Proverbs 16,32: טוב ארך אפים מגבור, “he that is slow to&nbsp;anger is better than he who is mighty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: Moses refers here to what he imagined the nations as saying when faced with the&nbsp;disappearance of the Jewish nation. He is challenging G’d to&nbsp;prove to all those who do not believe in G’d’s ability to let the&nbsp;Jewish people conquer the Canaanites and dispossess&nbsp;them, that they are indeed capable of doing just that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'כח ה</span><span class="font5">, the name of G’d here is the one we spell with the letter ד, i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">adonay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר דברת, </span><span class="font5">“as You have said.” (During the episode of the golden calf.) There are minor differences between what&nbsp;was said then and what is recorded now. These differences&nbsp;are immaterial, as in almost all cases in the Torah when&nbsp;something is repeated the two versions are not absolutely&nbsp;identical</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ה׳ ארך אפים</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord is slow to anger;” Moses&nbsp;does not mention the attribute </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“el”</span><span class="font5"> here in connection with&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">erech apayim,</span><span class="font5"> though it usually is mentioned. The reason for&nbsp;this is that it normally reflects aspects of G’d’s power, and&nbsp;Moses did not want G’d to display His power against Israel.&nbsp;He also did not mention the attributes of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rachum v’chanun&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">aspects of G’d’s mercy and grace, as these attributes are&nbsp;used when describing G’d as bestowing gifts on mankind, as&nbsp;we know from Psalms 37,21: וצדיק חונן ונותן, “and the&nbsp;righteous excels in generosity and keeps giving.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses did not beg G’d to show his people favoritism, but he wanted Him to grant forgiveness on the basis of the&nbsp;attribute: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">emet,</span><span class="font5"> “truth,” but on the basis of what is known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lifnim mishurat</span><span class="font5"> hadin, somewhat beyond the strict&nbsp;requirements of justice. However, the word אמת describes&nbsp;absolute truth, without allowances being made for special&nbsp;considerations of the person or persons being judged.&nbsp;(compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b’chor shor</span><span class="font5"> on Leviticus 5,15.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the reason why Moses omitted to refer to G’d’s attribute of truth is that he did not&nbsp;want G’d to employ that attribute as it had been mentioned&nbsp;by G’d when He said: “I will smite them with pestilence,”&nbsp;which would have been what the Israelites deserved at that&nbsp;stage. [after all, surely G’d would not have exceeded the&nbsp;application of pure justice as represented by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">emet,</span><span class="font5"> truth. Ed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses also did not invoke G’d’s attribute of נוצר חסד, “storing up good deeds,” performed in the past by the party&nbsp;or parties being judged. G’d had told Moses, that on the&nbsp;contrary, the people had tested Him beyond endurance&nbsp;already 10 times [and had certainly used up any reservoir of&nbsp;goodwill they had built up in the past. My words. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחטאה</span><span class="font5">, “an inadvertent transgression;” Moses could not invoke this attribute of G’d as what the people had just&nbsp;become guilty of could never be called “inadvertent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.19. סלח נא </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">לעוו העם הזה</span><span class="font5">, “please forgive the deliberately committed sin of this nation!” This is a reference&nbsp;to the sin of the spies;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכאשר נשאת לעם הזה ממצרים ועד הנה</span><span class="font5">, “just as You have upgraded the sins of the nation ever since they left Egypt&nbsp;especially the episode of the golden calf, [by remembering&nbsp;their lowly origins. Ed.].</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,20. סלחתי כדבריך</span><span class="font5">, “I have forgiven, as you yourself have said,” i.e. the episode of the golden calf. Now, however,&nbsp;I am unable to do so. And have to demand what is My due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: “in accordance with your request.” G’d refers to two occasions when He had forgiven&nbsp;the Jewish people, once during the episode of the golden&nbsp;calf, and now for the sin of the people being misled-by the&nbsp;majority report of the spies. On the first occasion His&nbsp;forgiveness had been more comprehensive, i.e. He had used&nbsp;more of His attributes in doing so. This is why He adds the&nbsp;words: “according to your words.” You yourself, by appealing&nbsp;to only a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">part</span><span class="font5"> of the attributes I have taught you to use when&nbsp;the need arises to appeal to Me, are in agreement that this&nbsp;situation cannot be compared to the incitement of the mixed&nbsp;multitude at the time when you had not returned from Mount&nbsp;Sinai for over forty days, and they thought you might not be&nbsp;able to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d reminded Moses that he himself had agreed that the rules of justice were not to be bent, by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">omitting</span><span class="font5"> to appeal&nbsp;to this. The author continues to find hints of this in the&nbsp;difference of the spelling of the word כדברך without the plural&nbsp;letter י i.e. כדבריך, which the rules of grammar would have&nbsp;dictated as the correct spelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By condemning the generation of male adults who had left Egypt at the Exodus to die only gradually, about two and&nbsp;a half percent a year, G’d demonstrated that the principle of&nbsp;considering the positive accomplishment of the past&nbsp;generation when dealing with the younger generation had&nbsp;been considered by Him even here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14 22. וינסו אתי</span><span class="font5">, “they put Me to the test” The word here is used as equivalent to ויכעיסו, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">They made Me angry.”&nbsp;Compare Onkelos on Genesis 40,6, where the word for&nbsp;זועפים is translated as “angry,” נסיסין. This is why the letter ס&nbsp;in this word has a dot, to show that it is a variation of the&nbsp;usual meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועבדי כלב, </span><span class="font5">“but My servant Caleb,” there was no&nbsp;need for G’d to mention Joshua by name here seeing it was&nbsp;he who would lead the people into the Holy Land. An&nbsp;alternate interpretation: There was no point in mentioning&nbsp;him, seeing that he had no children who would receive an&nbsp;ancestral share of that land. The Torah could not have&nbsp;written of him that his descendants would inherit their share&nbsp;of the land</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וימלא אחרי</span><span class="font5">, “he followed Me fully;” he completed Moses’ task, My messenger’s task, trying to make him more&nbsp;effective. The use of the root מלא in the same sense as&nbsp;translated here is not unique; we find an example of it in&nbsp;Kings I 1,14: ואני אבוא אחריך ומלאתי את דבריך, “and I will come&nbsp;immediately after you and confirm and reinforce your&nbsp;words.”(The prophet Natan to Bat-sheva, mother of&nbsp;Solomon)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וזרעו יורישנה</span><span class="font5">, ”and his seed will inherit it.” The root ירש in the transitive mode is used here to mean “inherit,” in other&nbsp;words: “and I will cause his seed to leave it as an inheritance&nbsp;[To more distant generations also. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והעמלקי</span><span class="font5">, “and the nation of Amalek, etc.” G’d now&nbsp;reciprocated what the spies had done. They had intimidated&nbsp;the Israelites by pointing to the Amalekites as powerful&nbsp;adversaries; G’d does the same to the people now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והכנעני, </span><span class="font5">“and the Canaanite; “actually both the Canaanite and the Emorite, who was one of the Canaanite tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יושב בעמק</span><span class="font5">, “who dwells in the valley.” This sounds somewhat puzzling, seeing that a few verses later these&nbsp;people are described as descending (verse 45.) What the&nbsp;Torah had meant was that most of the Canaanites were&nbsp;dwelling in the valley, but the ones dwelling in the mountains&nbsp;would attack and overpower any Israelites daring at this time&nbsp;against the wishes of G’d to engage them in war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is also possible that although these tribes dwelled in the valley they had moved out of their homes to higher&nbsp;ground in order to have the advantage over any Israelites&nbsp;who would have to climb in order to engage them in a fight. It&nbsp;was not unusual to plant ambushes as we know from Psalms</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">10,8, ישב במארב חצרים, “dwelling in an ambush in isolated&nbsp;areas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מחר פנו וסעו לכם</span><span class="font5">, “tomorrow turn, and start journeying;” in this instance the word מחר is not to be understood as literally:&nbsp;“tomorrow,” but as “soon.” Actually, according to our sages&nbsp;the people stayed at Kadesh for 19 years. This is how they&nbsp;interpreted the line in verse 48 which described them as&nbsp;staying there for a long time. Use of the word as meaning&nbsp;something in the distant future is familiar to us from Exodus&nbsp;13,14: כי ישאלך בנך מחר</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“when your son will ask you מחר” [the&nbsp;son could not do this until after the parents having settled in&nbsp;the land of Israel prepared to observe the Passover. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">המדברה דרך ים סוף, </span><span class="font5">“toward the desert in the direction of the sea of reeds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,29. מבן עשרים שנה ומעלה</span><span class="font5">, “from twenty years and up.” Seeing that this was the age at which the male Israelites&nbsp;began to bear arms, it was that group who had been afraid to&nbsp;rely on G’d’s help.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,32. ופגריכם אתם</span><span class="font5">, “and you who are already corpses;”&nbsp;this verse has been truncated, and it should really have been&nbsp;written in the reverse order, i.e. ואתם פגריכם, “and as for you,&nbsp;your carcasses etc.” This is also what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> had in mind&nbsp;when he wrote: “as per the Targum, your carcasses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יהיו רועים</span><span class="font5">, “they will be wanderers;” this is meant literally, i.e. like sheep that are wanderers, [not like shepherds, Ed.]&nbsp;Sheep do not wander in one direction but often cross areas&nbsp;that they had fed on earlier in the season. Your children will&nbsp;also be nomads like those sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;במספר הימים</span><span class="font5">, “according to the number of days;”&nbsp;the letter ב in במספר has a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dagesh,</span><span class="font5"> dot in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וידעתם את תנואתי</span><span class="font5">, “so you shall know My displeasure.” You claimed that I had planned to kill you by the enemies’&nbsp;swords in order not to have to bring you to the Holy Land;&nbsp;now you will experience the reverse; you will live out your&nbsp;lives but to no purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אם לא זאת אעשה</span><span class="font5">, “surely this I will do;” we have&nbsp;here three short verses all dealing with the same subject. 1)&nbsp;You will not get to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">see </span><span class="font5">the land you were to have made your&nbsp;home in. 2) You will not even </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">enter </span><span class="font5">it. 3) This will include&nbsp;your </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">whole</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">congregation [the ones who were 20 years old at&nbsp;the time of the Exodus. Ed.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,36. והאנשים אשר שלח משה</span><span class="font5">, “and the men that Moses had sent forth;” the spies, G’d did not let them live out their&nbsp;lives but killed them at once by a plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישובו וילינו</span><span class="font5">, “made all the congregation murmur against him.” Once was not enough, but they repeated their negative&nbsp;attitude to conquering the land of the Canaanites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,41. 'את פי ה</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord’s commandment?” He had told you that you would turn back in the direction of the sea of&nbsp;reeds, whereas you now insist on undertaking a military&nbsp;campaign against the Canaanites. (compare verse 25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,43. כי על כן שבתם</span><span class="font5">, “for you turned away from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem </span><span class="font5">again.” The reason why the spies frightened you was in order&nbsp;to turn you away from G’d, and now when they succeeded&nbsp;you wanted to do this once more? Do you still not place your&nbsp;confidence in Him? The only reason why He is not going to&nbsp;be on your side is that you constantly rebel against Him! If&nbsp;you will again transgress against His commandment you will&nbsp;surely be defeated until the forty years He decreed will have&nbsp;passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,45. ויכום</span><span class="font5">, the Amalekites defeated them</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויכתום, “</span><span class="font5">the Canaanites beat them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,2. דבר אל בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “speak to the Children of Israel!” When G’d saw that finally they had acknowledged their&nbsp;wrongdoing and had repented, and had mourned&nbsp;appropriately, He spoke to them on the subject of sacrificial&nbsp;offerings to be offered once they had settled in the land of&nbsp;Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל ארץ מושבותיכם, </span><span class="font5">“to the land wherein you will settle;” but while in the desert, these sacrifices are not welcome.&nbsp;These sacrifices are effective only for sins committed&nbsp;inadvertently; you however, have committed the sins fully&nbsp;aware of what you had done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,4. והקריב המקריב</span><span class="font5">, “the one presenting the offering shall present it;” Rabbi Natan understands this verse as an&nbsp;introductory formula applicable to all such situations,&nbsp;something known in Talmudic parlance as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">binyan av.</span><span class="font5"> It&nbsp;teaches that no one offering a gift offering may use </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">less</span><span class="font5"> than&nbsp;the quantities and ingredients listed in this verse. (Sifri,)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על העולה או לזבח</span><span class="font5">, “on either a burnt offering or an offering part of the meat of which could be consumed;” why did this&nbsp;have to be spelled out here? We had read in verse 3: ועשיתם&nbsp;אשה עולה או זבח, “you are to make a fire offering or a burnt&nbsp;offering for the Lord;” from that line we heard that if someone&nbsp;declares: ”I undertake to present a burnt offering, I am going&nbsp;to present a meat offering,” he declares: “I am going to&nbsp;present a gift offering, and “I am going to present a peace&nbsp;offering,” [in other words, all these types of offerings. Ed] that&nbsp;he did not have to add more that a single libation offering&nbsp;with all of these offerings; this is why the Torah here had to&nbsp;spell out that these libation offerings must accompany each&nbsp;of the above mentions animal or meal offerings. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,9 והקריב על בן הבקר</span><span class="font5">, “he will present it with the bullock;” the word על means “with,” in this instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,11. ככה יעשה לשור האחד</span><span class="font5">, “so it shall be done for each bullock;” we learn from here that the Torah did not distinguish&nbsp;between the amounts used for libation offerings of young&nbsp;animals such as a calf, and the amounts used to accompany&nbsp;animals that had fully matured. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או לאיל האחד</span><span class="font5">, “or for each ram.” Why did this detail have to be spelled out? I might have thought that seeing that the&nbsp;Torah had distinguished between the size of libations for one&nbsp;year old animals and two year old animals, and the size of&nbsp;the libations for three year old animals, it would similarly&nbsp;distinguish between the sizes of the libations for three year&nbsp;old animals of one type and another type, and between the&nbsp;males of the species or the females, therefore it equates&nbsp;sheep and goats i.e. the biggest of the categories known as&nbsp;בהמה דקה, the smaller categories of domestic beasts&nbsp;acceptable as sacrifices and the larger ones, known as בהמה&nbsp;גסה. The amounts of fine flour used in the libation offerings&nbsp;accompanying either animal, are identical in volume, i.e.&nbsp;three logs of fine flour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לאחד כמספרם</span><span class="font5">, “for everyone according to their&nbsp;number.” The letter ל in the word לאחד, has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">under it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל האזרח יעשה ככה</span><span class="font5">, “every home-born Israelite&nbsp;shall do so.” Why did this have to be stated? Seeing that the&nbsp;Torah had written in Leviticus 22,24 that every priest&nbsp;suffering from crushed testicles, etc., is forbidden from&nbsp;offering sacrifices in the Temple, [as this is a blemish, though&nbsp;not visible. Ed.], whereas all unblemished priests are fit to&nbsp;perform Temple service, a gentile from whom the Torah is&nbsp;prepared to accept burnt offerings, would also accompany&nbsp;such a burnt offering with the appropriate libation or meal&nbsp;offerings, the Torah here restricts the latter offerings to&nbsp;natural born Jews, excluding even converts. This resulted in&nbsp;the rabbis ruling that a gentile who sent the animal he wished&nbsp;to have presented as an offering on his behalf from the&nbsp;country he resided in and he did not send the appropriate&nbsp;meal offerings and libations with that animal, will have the&nbsp;appropriate meal offerings and libation offerings paid for from&nbsp;the public purse so that these sacrifices are not without their&nbsp;appropriate meal offerings and libations. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכי יגור אתכם גר או אשר בתוככם</span><span class="font5">, “and if amongst you&nbsp;there sojourns a stranger, or whoever there may be amongst&nbsp;you throughout your generations, etc,” this verse appears in&nbsp;a truncated form; it should be understood as if the Torah had&nbsp;written it as follows: “if a stranger who lives amongst you at&nbsp;the present, or at some time in the future, etc.;” from this&nbsp;verse we learn that this paragraph has been written in the&nbsp;Torah twice, and been repeated in order to add to it two&nbsp;details that had not previously been revealed to the people.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,19. והיה באכלכם</span><span class="font5">, “it shall be when you eat of, etc.” the&nbsp;letter ב at the beginning of the word באכלכם, has the vowel&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chatof patach</span><span class="font5"> under it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,20 כתרומת גרן, </span><span class="font5">“as that which is set aside from the threshing ground;” this is equivalent to what is known&nbsp;elsewhere as ראשית עריסותיכם, “the first product of your&nbsp;kneading bowls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,21. מראשית עריסותיכם</span><span class="font5">, this includes the parts of the harvest to be left for the poor, such as the field’s corner,&nbsp;gleanings, and areas the reaper forgot to cut, all of which are&nbsp;subject to the laws of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">challah,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. before the proceeds are&nbsp;baked, a small portion had to be set aside for the priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לדורותיכם</span><span class="font5">, “throughout your generations.” According to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> on this verse this includes any dough baked during&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> year as well as any dough that qualifies for the&nbsp;laws of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">challah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,27.ואם נפש אחת תחטא בשגגה</span><span class="font5">, “and if one person sin through error, etc.;” idolatry is one of the sins which can be&nbsp;atoned for by an offering of the appropriate animal sacrifice&nbsp;by the guilty party, either through presenting a female sheep&nbsp;female or goat, as specified. It depends on the social status&nbsp;of the sinner. If a national leader had become guilty of that&nbsp;sin through error, he has to bring a male goat, if it was the&nbsp;High Priest, a bullock; also if the president of the Supreme&nbsp;Court had become guilty of that sin, he has to present a&nbsp;mature bullock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the reasons that a female goat is referred to as שעירה, and not as עז, is that the practice of offering goats&nbsp;called satyrs to their deities was so wide-spread amongst the&nbsp;idolaters. (Compare Leviticus 17,7) This is the reason why&nbsp;this paragraph had to be written especially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עז בת שנתה</span><span class="font5">, “a female goat during the first year of its life.” Every time the term עז appears in the Torah, it refers to&nbsp;a female goat of less than one year. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונכרתה הנפש ההיא</span><span class="font5">, “that soul will be cut off;”&nbsp;whenever the root כרת is used it refers to a separation,&nbsp;ending of a previous relationship.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עונה</span><span class="font5">, “her guilt;” the letter ה in the word עונה does&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font5"> have a dot. [although we would have expected it as it is a&nbsp;pronoun ending. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,32. ויהיו בני ישראל במדבר</span><span class="font5">, “While the Children of Israel were in the desert, etc.;” they remained there as G’d had&nbsp;decreed that they could not enter the Land of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The commandments that have been listed immediately preceding this paragraph were all commandments that could&nbsp;not be fulfilled outside that land. This is why they had been&nbsp;introduced with the words: וכי תבאו אל הארץ, “when you will&nbsp;come to the land.” The only one discussed here that was not&nbsp;only applicable in the Holy Land were the laws of the&nbsp;Sabbath which apply universally, wherever Jews happen to&nbsp;be, even when they are in the desert. This is why the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">fact&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">that the man who collected kindling on the Sabbath was in&nbsp;the desert was written, as we would have known that he was&nbsp;in the desert, where else could he have been? (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">on verse 34.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וימצאו איש מקושש עצים</span><span class="font5">, “they found a man collecting kindling.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this line is written as a critique&nbsp;of the Israelites, seeing that at least one of them did not even&nbsp;observe the second Sabbath already. [Actually, some&nbsp;Israelites who went out of the camp with containers to collect&nbsp;manna on the first Sabbath also violated the Sabbath&nbsp;legislation, although this was before the Torah had been&nbsp;given. Ed.] From </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> comment we must assume that this&nbsp;incident occurred already during the first year of the&nbsp;Israelites’ wanderings. On the other hand, the incident of the&nbsp;blasphemer recorded in Leviticus chapter 24, took place in&nbsp;the second year, as in the first year the Israelites had not yet&nbsp;arranged their tribal positions around the Tabernacle&nbsp;according to their tribal flags.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מקושש עצים ביום השבת</span><span class="font5">, “collecting kindling on the Sabbath day.” According to one opinion, the violation&nbsp;consisted of his carrying the kindling a distance greater than&nbsp;four cubits in the public domain. According to another opinion&nbsp;the sin consisted of his having cut the kindling from the tree’s&nbsp;trunk on the Sabbath. A third opinion holds that he was guilty&nbsp;of the sin of bundling these kindling together as in making&nbsp;sheaves. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat folio 96.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וימצאו</span><span class="font5">, “they found;” this teaches that Moses must have appointed men especially appointed to look for lawbreakers&nbsp;on the Sabbath. One or more of these guards found the&nbsp;culprit, and the cautioned him. (Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ויקריבו אותו וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and the men who had found him&nbsp;brought him to Moses;” why did this have to be repeated&nbsp;once more? We had already heard what this man had been&nbsp;found doing on the Sabbath? It was repeated to let us know&nbsp;that the men who found him had warned him of the&nbsp;consequences in store for him if he did not desist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי לא פורש מה יעשה לו</span><span class="font5">, “for it had not been&nbsp;specified what should be done to him.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that&nbsp;whereas it was known that the man had to be executed,&nbsp;which of the four methods to be used in this case had not yet&nbsp;been spelled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask why this man should not be executed by strangulation seeing that it had not been stated that he&nbsp;has to be stoned, and strangulation is the standard method&nbsp;of execution for most capital sins, the answer is that Moses&nbsp;was in doubt what precisely was the sin that called for&nbsp;execution here, if desecration was equivalent to desecrating&nbsp;the name of the Lord by worshipping an idol, in which case&nbsp;execution was to be by means of the sword. This is why he&nbsp;was kept locked up until Moses received an answer from&nbsp;G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to say, that in accordance with the view of Rabbi Yehudah that if the sinner had not been warned of&nbsp;what </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">kind</span><span class="font5"> of death penalty he could expect, no conviction&nbsp;could be obtained from a court, you would have to answer&nbsp;that the witnesses advised him that he would be liable to one&nbsp;of the four kinds of executions provided for by the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועשו להם ציצית</span><span class="font5">, “that they make for themselves fringes;” When G’d created the universe (our globe) He did not create&nbsp;anything that could not lend itself to perform a commandment&nbsp;with. If a farmer goes out to plough his field, he must take&nbsp;care not to use an ox and a donkey to pull the plough. If he&nbsp;goes out to sow seeds, he must be sure not to violate the&nbsp;commandment of mixing two species of seeds to grow in the&nbsp;same row. If he goes out to harvest, he must take care not to&nbsp;harvest every last bit of the field. If his wife bakes bread, or&nbsp;better, makes a dough for bread, she must take care to set&nbsp;aside something for the priest. The list could be continued ad&nbsp;infinitum. [This editor has contented himself with part of the&nbsp;list spelled out by our author. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is a rule for agricultural activities and domestic activities in the kitchen, also applies to the clothing we wear.&nbsp;G’d has provided us with an opportunity to perform a&nbsp;commandment even in that area of our lives, though we are&nbsp;not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">obligated</span><span class="font5"> to wear four cornered garments nor to mix wool&nbsp;and linen, otherwise forbidden, when doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על ציצית הכנף, “</span><span class="font5">on the fringes of each corner,” i.e. “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">together</span><span class="font5"> with the fringes on each corner of that garment.” An&nbsp;example of a similar construction is found in Leviticus 25,31:&nbsp;על שדה הארץ, which does on mean: “on the field of the&nbsp;country,” but “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the field of the country.” Three of the&nbsp;fringes are white in colour, whereas the fourth is blue. This is&nbsp;what our sages said in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'וזכרתם את כל מצות ה</span><span class="font5">, “so that you will remember&nbsp;all the commandments of the Lord;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains this line&nbsp;by pointing out that the numerical value of the word ציצית is&nbsp;600; when you add the eight fringes and the five knots&nbsp;required to attach them in the traditional manner you have&nbsp;613, the number of the commandments of the Torah. Seeing&nbsp;that the last three times the word ציצ(י)ת appears in this&nbsp;paragraph the letter י is missing, each time that word appears&nbsp;it reminds us of the number 613.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא תתורו אחרי לבבכם ואחרי עיניכם</span><span class="font5">, “and you must not go about after your hearts and after your eyes;” whenever you&nbsp;look at one of My commandments you are to remember that&nbsp;you are My servants and are not free to follow your&nbsp;inclinations when they deviate from My commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.40, למען תזכרו ועשיתם את כל מצותי</span><span class="font5">, “so that you will remember and carry out all My commandments, and not&nbsp;violate them.” This paragraph has been inserted next to the&nbsp;paragraph that dealt with the person collecting kindling on&nbsp;the Sabbath, so that you will remember what happened to&nbsp;that person for violating My commandment. After having&nbsp;witnessed this, the people might have thought: “how can we&nbsp;ever observe the laws of the Sabbath after having witnessed&nbsp;that this man was executed for a minor infraction?” At least&nbsp;when it comes to the observance of the festivals there are&nbsp;symbols on that day that remind us of the nature of it, but&nbsp;what distinguishes the Sabbath from the weekdays so that it&nbsp;could serve as a reminder? Therefore the Torah gave us the&nbsp;commandment of fringes as a symbol of clothing that would&nbsp;be worn on the Sabbath, although it would be inconvenient to&nbsp;wear such garment on weekdays when we have to go about&nbsp;our work. Our sages have formulated it thus: “anyone who&nbsp;does not wear a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tallit</span><span class="font5"> with fringes on the Sabbath is&nbsp;comparable to the person who collected kindling on the&nbsp;Sabbath. [This is a quote from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tossaphot,</span><span class="font5"> sages who were&nbsp;contemporaries of our author. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והייתם קדושים לאלוקיכם, </span><span class="font5">“and then you will be holy for your G’d.” And who is this G’d of yours?</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,41. אני ה' אלוקיכם אשר הוצאתי אתכם מארץ מצריפ </span><span class="font5">, “I am</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">the Lord you G’d. Who has taken you out of the land of Egypt.” Quoting from the writings of Rabbi Moshe </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ha-darshon,</span><span class="font5"> one of his favourite sources, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments the&nbsp;eight (folded over 4) strings making up the fringes at each&nbsp;corner of a four-cornered garment symbolize the eight days it&nbsp;took the Jewish people after leaving Egypt to finally being&nbsp;free from pursuit. That was when they broke out in the song&nbsp;of thanksgiving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to say that they descended into the sea on the evening of the seventh day according to Exodus 14,5,&nbsp;and the recited the song of thanksgiving on the following&nbsp;morning, (which as till the seventh day), we have to assume&nbsp;that the day on which they had moved from Goshen to&nbsp;Ramses, was included in the count of eight. The report in&nbsp;Exodus commences only after they had all miraculously&nbsp;assembled in Ramses, from where they proceeded to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Korach</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקח קרח</span><span class="font5">, “Korach took, etc.” Korach acquired&nbsp;people, sympathisers; which people did he acquire&nbsp;specifically?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Datan and Abiram, sons of Eliav, as well as On ben Pelet, members of the tribe of Reuven, </span><span class="font5">other discontents.&nbsp;The letter ו in the word ודתן is superfluous, but there are&nbsp;numerous such letters ו in similar situations. Compare one in&nbsp;Genesis 46,9 ובני ראובן חנוך ופלוא. Pelet and Phalu are&nbsp;identical, Eliav being the son of latter. We know this from&nbsp;Numbers 26,8. Seeing that the Torah previously had written&nbsp;in Numbers 14,35: במדבר הזה יתמו ושם ימותו, “in this desert&nbsp;they will be consumed, there they will die,” the Torah here&nbsp;explains why some of them died as the result of other&nbsp;specific occurrences, not just the sin of the spies. These&nbsp;people were quite numerous, including the twenty four&nbsp;thousand who died during the last year of the wanderings at&nbsp;Shittim as a result of sleeping with Moabite women and&nbsp;having worshipped the deity, Baal Pe-or of those women. Not&nbsp;a single one of the adult males who had left Egypt and who&nbsp;were alive during that debacle survived the march through&nbsp;the desert. (Numbers 26,64)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקומו לפני משה</span><span class="font5">, ”they orchestrated an uprising&nbsp;against Moses;” Korach’s specific complaint was that seeing&nbsp;that he was the firstborn of his father’s sons, (Exodus 6,21)&nbsp;Aaron instead had been given preferential treatment. Datan,&nbsp;Abiram and On were angry that their tribe had been deprived&nbsp;of the status that should have been accorded to the firstborn&nbsp;of Yaakov their founding father, and that status had been&nbsp;accorded to Joseph and his descendants instead. They&nbsp;believed that this was due to the fact that Joshua from the&nbsp;tribe of Ephrayim, Joseph’s son, had been chosen by Moses&nbsp;to be his closest disciple and valet, the whole tribe had been&nbsp;promoted to special status. They also considered that the&nbsp;leaders of the various tribes had been chosen as they were&nbsp;each firstborns, and that therefore it was clear that their tribe&nbsp;had been deliberately demoted. (Ibn Ezra) Proof that this&nbsp;was their complaint can be seen from Numbers 17,25, where&nbsp;the Torah reports that finally, when Aaron’s staff, i.e. a&nbsp;representative of the tribe of Levi, brought forth a bud that&nbsp;developed into almonds, the Torah reports that these kinds&nbsp;of complaints ceased. They finally realised that G’d had&nbsp;chosen the tribe of Levi rather that Yaakov’s firstborn son&nbsp;Reuven, i.e. that the system of allocating spiritual and&nbsp;material advantages to the firstborn had been replaced by a&nbsp;system of hereditary spiritual background, such as G’d’s&nbsp;having chosen the descendants of three proven patriarchs as&nbsp;His “firstborn” people, a message relayed to Pharaoh at the&nbsp;beginning of Moses’ career. [some of these words are mine.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, Korach rebelled against what appears to be the message of Exodus 13,2, that all the&nbsp;firstborn are to be sanctified, i.e. they were not holy through&nbsp;birth, and he claimed that the entire people of Israel, ever&nbsp;since they had accepted the Torah had become holy, as all&nbsp;had participated in the revelation at Mount Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואנשים מבני ישראל חמשים ומאתים</span><span class="font5">, “together with another two hundred and fifty men from various sections among the&nbsp;Israelites.” He selected twenty three from each tribe&nbsp;excluding members from his own tribe; the reason that he&nbsp;chose the number twenty three was that that number&nbsp;constituted the number of judges required to deal with sins&nbsp;involving capital punishment. Each tribe had a high court&nbsp;comprising that number of judges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you add Korach, Datan, Aviram and On, you have a total of 253 rebels, not counting the leader. At this juncture,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that all these men garbed themselves in&nbsp;prayer shawls made entirely of blue wool. They supposedly&nbsp;challenged Moses by asking if those prayer shawls required&nbsp;fringes, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzitzit.</span><span class="font5"> When Moses ruled that they did require&nbsp;fringes, they started ridiculing him and his Torah, by arguing&nbsp;that if a whole garment can be fit to wear by adding a single&nbsp;strand of blue wool, it was nonsensical to disallow these&nbsp;prayer shawls that consisted exclusively of blue wool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators claim that Korach used this commandment as it was the one most recently written in the&nbsp;Torah. Korach used that commandment as something to&nbsp;challenge Moses with. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Tanchuma Korach</span><span class="font5"> section 2.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">קריאי עדה, “elect men of the assembly.” They had been called out to assume a challenging position in front of the&nbsp;Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי כל העדה כולם קדושים</span><span class="font5">, “for the entire congregation&nbsp;are all holy.” Korach was referring to the firstborn of each&nbsp;family. (Ibn Ezra). He based himself of Exodus 13,2. It&nbsp;follows that it is the firstborn who have the duty and the&nbsp;privilege to perform the service in the Tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישמע משה</span><span class="font5">, “Moses heard;” he understood that&nbsp;Korach’s rebellion was aimed at usurping the position of his&nbsp;brother Aaron, the High Priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויפול על פניו</span><span class="font5">, “he fell upon his face;” he was ashamed and put his face on the ground in order to offer a prayer. He&nbsp;hoped to receive a revelation from G’d how to confront this&nbsp;challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,6. קחו לכם מחתות</span><span class="font5">, “take censers for yourselves.” It did&nbsp;not occur to Moses that these rebels would take him up on&nbsp;this, after all it was well known to all that anyone offering&nbsp;incense who had not been authorised to do so would die at&nbsp;the hands of G’d, as had even Aaron’s own two elder sons.&nbsp;Seeing that Korach challenged Moses with uncalled for&nbsp;accusations pulled out of thin air, Moses retaliated with&nbsp;equally ridiculous sounding answers, answers that he&nbsp;thought would be challenged instead of being taken&nbsp;seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,8. ויאמר משה אל קרח</span><span class="font5">, “Moses said to Korach, etc.;” his first words were addressed to Korach and his immediate&nbsp;followers, i.e. fellow Levites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,10. ויקרב אותך ואת אחיך</span><span class="font5">, “and He has brought you near as well as your fellow Levites after you. Korach was a&nbsp;grandson of Kehat, who was one of the Levites charged with&nbsp;carrying the Holy Ark on their shoulders, a privilege reserved&nbsp;only for Kehat and his offspring but not for other Levites.&nbsp;They were also the head of the Levites performing the songs&nbsp;in the Tabernacle as spelled out in Chronicles I16,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובקשתם גם כהונה</span><span class="font5">, “and you also demand a share in the priesthood?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לכן</span><span class="font5">, “therefore,” i.e. since you have also&nbsp;demanded to have the status of priests;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'הנועדים על ה</span><span class="font5">, “you, the ones who have joined together against the Lord;” you have gathered today and you will see&nbsp;G’d’s response tomorrow;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי תלונו</span><span class="font5">, “because you have complained;” this word normally should have been spelled with the letter י instead of&nbsp;the letter ו in the middle. [Our author, when making these&nbsp;observations merely points out that the spelling is not a&nbsp;scribe’s error. He does not engage in speculations of why the&nbsp;Torah deviated from the norm. Ed.] The word is read as if it&nbsp;had been spelled: תלינו.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא נעלה</span><span class="font5">, “we will not go up [to face Moses].This&nbsp;does not mean that Moses stood on an elevated platform,&nbsp;but is a standard expression when people are asked to&nbsp;appear before a judge or judges. Our author quotes&nbsp;Deuteronomy 25,7, as well as Judges 4,5, and Ruth 4,1, as&nbsp;proof of his interpretation. In each instance the verb עלה is&nbsp;used for people appearing at a court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תשתרר עלינו גם השתרר</span><span class="font5">, “but you have also&nbsp;imposed a dictatorship over us!” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;Torah uses the word גם, usually translated as “also,” both&nbsp;positively and negatively, i.e. as a continuation of something&nbsp;previous, or as an abrupt opposite of something previously&nbsp;stated. Our verse is an example of Datan and Abiram using it&nbsp;in the latter sense as if asking: “are you now going to also&nbsp;(even) act as dictator? Exodus 12,32 is such an example&nbsp;where the Pharaoh who had railed against Moses and Aaron&nbsp;all the time, suddenly makes a 180 degree turn by pleading&nbsp;for Moses to bless him also when offering sacrifices to the&nbsp;Jewish G’d. Numbers 22,33, is another such example where&nbsp;the angel who had </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">killed anyone tells Bileam that he&nbsp;would have killed not only his ass but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">also </span><span class="font5">Bileam if he had&nbsp;been at liberty to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;העיני האנשים ההם תנקר</span><span class="font5">, “will you gouge out the&nbsp;eyes of these men?” The verse is to be understood as a&nbsp;question, not as a statement, the authors expressing their&nbsp;astonishment that Moses hoped to get away with misleading&nbsp;the people with such trick. They themselves could certainly&nbsp;not be fooled by him, someone who had so utterly failed in&nbsp;his so-called mission up to now. They expressed wonder that&nbsp;the eyes of the Jewish people should have been fooled thus&nbsp;far, it looked to them as if these people had been blind all the&nbsp;time. [They were clearly the greatest demagogues up to that&nbsp;time! Ed.] Now, instead of making good on their promises,&nbsp;they had decreed that a whole generation of Israelites were&nbsp;to perish in this desert! They would not appear in front of him&nbsp;to be judged by him, he had lost all credence as a leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,15. אל תפן אל מנחתם</span><span class="font5">, “do not turn to their gift offering!” The reason why Moses cursed Datan and Abiram, by asking&nbsp;G’d not to accept their offering if any, was because even&nbsp;assuming, as he did, that they would not retract even if G’d&nbsp;were to say, as He did, that He had chosen Aaron and not&nbsp;Moses, they would still challenge the hereditary nature of the&nbsp;priesthood;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Korach and his followers, on the other hand, by each taking the censers in which to offer incense outside the&nbsp;Tabernacle, did not challenge the priesthood itself, only&nbsp;Aaron’s appointment as High Priest. Therefore he did not ask&nbsp;G’d not to accept the incense of these 250 men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא חמור אחד מהם נשאתי</span><span class="font5">, “I have not appropriated a single donkey from anyone of them;” this remark by Moses is&nbsp;relevant to verse three, when he and Aaron had been&nbsp;accused of having elevated himself above the people. The&nbsp;vocalization of the word חמור corresponds to the plain&nbsp;meaning of the verse, whereas according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">interpretation the word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">echad</span><span class="font5"> should have been </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">achad,</span><span class="font5"> “one&nbsp;of,” as in Genesis 26,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נשאתי</span><span class="font5">, an expression meaning “I have taken.” It occurs in this sense also in Samuel II 5,21: וישאם דוד ואנשיו, “and&nbsp;David and his men took them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא הרעותי את אחד מהם</span><span class="font5">, “and I have not done wrong to a single one of them.” Moses referred to the fact that Datan&nbsp;and Abiram had betrayed him to Pharaoh for killing the&nbsp;Egyptian who had first killed an Israelite without provocation.&nbsp;(Exodus 2,11-2,15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואכלה אותם כרגע</span><span class="font5">, “so that I may consume them in&nbsp;a moment;” if you were to ask that we have a rule that&nbsp;punishment must not be meted out unless preceded by a&nbsp;warning, Moses had warned them in the name of G’d when&nbsp;he had said to them to come up for judgment in the presence&nbsp;of the Lord on the following morning together with Aaron in&nbsp;verse 16. However, Korach had not complied. This is why&nbsp;G’d could be angry at them without delay, seeing that&nbsp;Korach. instead of complying with G’d’s instruction had&nbsp;assembled the whole congregation as per verse 19, in order&nbsp;to get the maximum publicity value out of his rebellion. As a&nbsp;result, G’d was justified in carrying out sentence immediately.&nbsp;The participants and guilty people had already all been&nbsp;warned. (17,10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אלוקי הרוחות לכל בשר</span><span class="font5">, “O G’d, Spirit of flesh, etc.;”&nbsp;Moses refers to the fact that G’d has knowledge of our&nbsp;innermost thoughts at all times. As a result, He surely knows&nbsp;who is guilty and who is not. G’d tells him that he is quite&nbsp;correct and that is why He tells him now for the innocent to&nbsp;stand back and demonstrate their innocence. All he had to&nbsp;do is to tell people to remove themselves from Korach’s tent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">האיש אחד יחטא</span><span class="font5">, shall one man sin, etc.;” the letter ח in the word אחד has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz,</span><span class="font5"> to teach you that it is not&nbsp;something unusual for a human being to commit a sin; if&nbsp;there was something surprising here, it was that apparently&nbsp;G’d would therefore be angry at the whole congregation that&nbsp;man was a part of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,26. בכל חטאתם</span><span class="font5">, “in all their sins.” A better translation&nbsp;would be: “on account of their many sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,28. לעשות את כל המעשים האלה</span><span class="font5">, “to perform all these works.” I have tested them by the manner in which they&nbsp;related to the incense, as I have said, when I gave you a&nbsp;chance to compete against Aaron, each of you with his own&nbsp;censer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: to show if the priests could be exchanged for the Levites. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,30. </span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואם בריאה יברא ה</span><span class="font5">, “but if the Lord will create a new phenomenon, etc.;” these words do not refer to “earth,”&nbsp;seeing that since the first six days of creation, according to&nbsp;our sages (in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avot</span><span class="font5"> 5,6) no such new phenomenon had been&nbsp;created. Scripture itself is witness to this statement when the&nbsp;Torah wrote in Numbers 16,30 in our chapter that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">earth,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">i.e. an </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">existing </span><span class="font5">phenomenon, would open </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font5">mouth.&nbsp;Furthermore the Torah had written already in connection with&nbsp;Kayin (Genesis 4,11) that the earth did open its mouth. This&nbsp;is clear proof that the “mouth” of the earth and its function&nbsp;already existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What Moses meant was the following: if a new phenomenon which had never been </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">observed </span><span class="font5">until now,&nbsp;namely the descent of fully alive human beings into the&nbsp;bowels of the earth, will occur, this will be proof, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת כל האדם אשר לקרח </span><span class="font5">“and any human being&nbsp;siding with Korach, etc.” the expression: כל האדם, is&nbsp;somewhat puzzling at this point. It cannot refer to adult&nbsp;members of Korach’s family, as these had repeatedly been&nbsp;referred to as איש; we must therefore assume that it refers to&nbsp;his wife and minor children as well as to his servants and&nbsp;entourage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah states specifically that Korach’s sons (adults?) did not die; compare Numbers 26,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירדו הם</span><span class="font5">, “they descended, they;” the reason that&nbsp;these people, not Korach’s family or household members,&nbsp;but sympathisers, over and beyond the two hundred and fifty&nbsp;people mentioned at the beginning of this episode.&nbsp;descended into the bowels of the earth also. The word: הם is&nbsp;a limitation, excluding the two hundred and fifty men who had&nbsp;offered incense, seeing they had done so at the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">invitation</span><span class="font5"> of&nbsp;Moses. Although they had been totally wrong, their&nbsp;motivation was noble so that they died by being burned on&nbsp;the spot, but presumably were buried with honours, just as&nbsp;their censers were used as covers for the altar subsequently.&nbsp;(Numbers 17,3) The people who had </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">followed Moses’&nbsp;advice, were the ones that descended into the bowels of the&nbsp;earth. [Actually, of Datan and Aviram the Torah reports that&nbsp;they were burned to death (and that they descended into the&nbsp;bowels of the earth. Deut. 11.6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,34. נסו לקולם</span><span class="font5">, “they fled when hearing their sounds”.&nbsp;This is a reference to the outcries of the people being&nbsp;swallowed by the earth. We know of a parallel in Jeremiah&nbsp;49,21: מקול נפלם רעשה כל הארץ, “at the sound of their downfall&nbsp;the whole earth will shake.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,1. אמור אל אלעזר, “</span><span class="font5">say to Elazar, etc</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.;” </span><span class="font5">G’d did not want that Aaron the High Priest become ritually impure, as&nbsp;he was involved actively in offering sacrifices, that is why He&nbsp;asked Moses to give these instructions to his son Elazar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;החטאים האלה בנפשותם</span><span class="font5">, “these sinners who paid for&nbsp;their sins with their lives;” they brought their death upon&nbsp;themselves. Moses had warned them in 16,7, when he made&nbsp;clear that only one person of all of them would be chosen by&nbsp;G’d. In other words, all the others would die as a result of this&nbsp;test. All of them foolishly risked their lives, knowing that 249&nbsp;of them would die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועשו אותם</span><span class="font5">, “so that they will make out of them, etc.” Moses, i.e. G’d refers to skilled artisans. This verse is&nbsp;abbreviated, as we find in similar verses such as Genesis&nbsp;48,1 ויאמר אל יוסף, “he said to Joseph,” where the subject is&nbsp;missing, or verse 2 in the same chapter where the person&nbsp;giving this information to Yaakov has also not been named.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקח אלעזר</span><span class="font5">, “Elazar took;” at first glance this does&nbsp;not appear the proper place for this verse. This verse should&nbsp;have begun with the words: זכרון לבני ישראל, “to be a memorial&nbsp;for the Children of Israel, etc.” Verse 4 was inserted here in&nbsp;order to provide a separation so that we would understand&nbsp;that from the beginning of this whole paragraph until the&nbsp;words: ויהיו לאות לבני ישראל, “so that will be a sign unto the&nbsp;Children of Israel,” Moses was told to speak to Elazar,&nbsp;whereas from verse 5 he was told to speak to Aaron,&nbsp;something which becomes clear at the end of that verse.&nbsp;Proof for this is provided by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> on chapter 18,8: וידבר ה' אל&nbsp;אהרן וגו', “the Lord spoke to Aaron, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">צפוי למזבח</span><span class="font5">, “a covering for the altar.” Until now the altar did not have a roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,5. זכרון לבני ישראל למען אשר לא יקרב איש זר</span><span class="font5">, “a reminder&nbsp;to the Children of Israel so that no non priest, etc.;” why was&nbsp;such a reminder necessary? Someone looking at the copper&nbsp;cover on the earthen altar (which was outside the&nbsp;Tabernacle) would be liable to ask: seeing that the Torah had&nbsp;written in Exodus 20,21 “make for Me an earthen altar,” i.e.&nbsp;fill the hollow with earth, what is the good of that earth if it&nbsp;was now going to be covered with copper sheathing?” He&nbsp;would be answered that this sheathing was constructed from&nbsp;the pans used by the rebels who had supported Korach in his&nbsp;rebellion against the hereditary institution of the priesthood.&nbsp;Seeing what had happened to the owners of these censers&nbsp;the people were afraid to question the institution of the&nbsp;priesthood in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביד משה לו</span><span class="font5">, ”through Moses to him.” The “him” refers to Korach. The meaning is; concerning Korach. The&nbsp;construction is similar to Genesis 28,15: כי לא אעזבך עד אשר עם&nbsp;עשיתי את אשר דברתי לך, “I will not abandon you until I have&nbsp;carried out all that I have said to you (promised to you) [G’d&nbsp;speaking in Yaakov’s dream of the ladder. Ed.] There too the&nbsp;word לב is to be understood as עליך, “concerning you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation understands the word לו, as referring to what Moses had said to Aaron. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi</span><span class="font5"> and Ibn&nbsp;Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,6. 'אתם המתם את עם ה</span><span class="font5">, “you are killing G’d’s people!” They meant that Moses and Aaron, by suggesting that the&nbsp;two hundred and fifty men offer incense, something non&nbsp;priests were forbidden to do, and doing it in a location where&nbsp;incense was not to be offered, were the direct cause of these&nbsp;people dying a sudden death. All of this had been caused by&nbsp;Moses and Aaron substituting the Levites for the firstborn,&nbsp;who previously were in their rights to offer incense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,11. אש מעל המזבח</span><span class="font5">, “fire taken from the altar;” Moses warned Aaron not to err and because of haste to use non&nbsp;consecrated fire as had done two of his sons who had paid&nbsp;with their lives for their error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושים קטרת</span><span class="font5">, “and lay incense;” in order to show them that you are a priest, and that the incense which they thought is&nbsp;the cause of death, is actually the cause of life if used by&nbsp;people authorised to do so, i.e. a priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכפר עליהם</span><span class="font5">, “and make atonement for them;” the smoke of the incense will act as a barrier against the plague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וקח מאתם מטה מטה, </span><span class="font5">“and take from each of them&nbsp;a staff;” seeing that they are still complaining about the tribe&nbsp;(מטה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font5">of Levi being the one G’d has selected to perform&nbsp;special duties, they were to realise that the significance of&nbsp;handling incense was not something that applied only to&nbsp;Aaron, but that Aaron’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">tribe</span><span class="font5">, the Levites, had a special role&nbsp;to perform. There was a need to demonstrate this by an&nbsp;additional miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי מטה אחד</span><span class="font5">, “for there shall be one staff, etc.”&nbsp;even though there is an internal division between ordinary&nbsp;Levites and the priests, they all belong to the same tribe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,20. והשכותי מעלי את תלונות בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “and I will put an end to the complaints of the Children of Israel against Me.”&nbsp;Their complaints were that you, Moses and Aaron, had acted&nbsp;arbitrarily when selecting a special rank for the members of&nbsp;the tribe of Levi in lieu of the firstborns of each family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וינח משה </span><span class="font5">, “and Moses laid out, etc.” the letter נ in&nbsp;the word וינח, has a dot in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויצא פרח</span><span class="font5">, “and bloomed blossoms;” this was to be&nbsp;a symbol that the young priests would come forth from the&nbsp;sons of Aaron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצץ ציץ</span><span class="font5">, “it had budded;” a sign that priests would come forth. The High Priests descended from Aaron would wear&nbsp;this ציץ, headband, engraved with the word: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kodesh,</span><span class="font5"> holy, on&nbsp;their forehand (compare Exodus 28,36).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויגמול שקדים</span><span class="font5">, “it bore ripe almonds.” This was an allusion to the eagerness with which the priests descended from&nbsp;Aaron would perform their duties. Throughout history the&nbsp;priests were lauded for the eagerness with which they&nbsp;performed their duties. They were cited as examples of such&nbsp;eagerness, i.e. כהנים זריזים הם (compare Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat,</span><span class="font5"> folio 20) According to some opinions, this&nbsp;phenomenon of Aaron’s staff producing blossoms and&nbsp;almonds was also one of the miracles for which G’d had&nbsp;provided the potential during dusk on the sixth day of&nbsp;creation. (Compare tractate Avot, chapter 5, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותכל תלונתם</span><span class="font5">. “so that their complaints will cease.” Our author understands the word as if the Torah had written:&nbsp;ותכלה אתה תלונתן של ישראל, “so that you will be able to bring to&nbsp;an end the Israelites’ complaints.” He cites two similar&nbsp;constructions in Deuteronomy 3,28: וצו את יהושע, and&nbsp;Genesis 38,14 ותכס בצעיף.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17,27. הן גוענו אבדנו, </span><span class="font5">“here we are perishing</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">some of the people would die from natural causes, whereas others&nbsp;would perish from external causes. When the people said&nbsp;this they were still under the impression that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">anyone</span><span class="font5">, not only&nbsp;non priests, would expose themselves to death by&nbsp;approaching the Tabernacle. They did not realise that only&nbsp;blemished </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">priests</span><span class="font5"> were included in this prohibition to&nbsp;approach too closely. (Compare Numbers 1,51) The&nbsp;subsequent general prohibition was in effect only for people&nbsp;who, having eaten holy things in a state of ritual impurity,&nbsp;dared approach sacred precincts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,1. ויאמר ה' אל אהרן </span><span class="font5">“The Lord said to Aaron, etc.;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that we must understand this line as&nbsp;meaning that G’d spoke to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Moses</span><span class="font5">, to tell what follows to&nbsp;Aaron. To the question of what forced </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> to ignore the&nbsp;text as written, i.e. that G’d addressed Aaron directly, we&nbsp;must understand what transpired as follows: The Torah, i.e.&nbsp;G’d, wishes the people to know that they were wrong in&nbsp;thinking that anyone daring to come into the vicinity of the&nbsp;Tabernacle would either be killed by G’d, or by a human&nbsp;tribunal, seeing that G’d had already said concerning Aaron:&nbsp;“you and your sons and your fathers, (all the priests) shall&nbsp;bear the iniquity of the Sanctuary;” in other words, it was the&nbsp;task of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">priests</span><span class="font5"> to ensure that the boundaries would not be&nbsp;crossed by people who had no authority to enter the&nbsp;Sanctuary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d had said the following to Moses to convey to Aaron: “you and your sons, etc,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In other words, what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> was saying here is that G’d had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">already</span><span class="font5"> told Moses to tell Aaron what follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He had done so in the portion of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bamidbar</span><span class="font5"> chapter 1, verse 51, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These instructions have been repeated here in verse 7, because a new element has been added, i.e. אתה ובניך ובית&nbsp;אביך, “you, your sons, and the house of your father;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that this paragraph has been written close to the people’s, especially Korach’s, complaints about the&nbsp;priests and the institution of hereditary priesthood, it has&nbsp;been positioned as a sort of introduction to the people’s gifts&nbsp;to the priests, seeing that these people were not landowners&nbsp;and depended for their livelihood on the willingness of the&nbsp;people to carry out all these instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our author adds as his own commentary concerning </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> words, that seeing that we have learned from the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> on 18,8 where the author quotes our verse, i.e. G’d, as&nbsp;speaking directly to Aaron, and in verse 8 of our chapter&nbsp;where we have the Torah writing again that G’d spoke to&nbsp;Aaron, and it certainly sounds very direct, that he had&nbsp;already stated on a previous occasion that every time we&nbsp;have the Torah writing: “G’d spoke to Aaron,” this refers to&nbsp;something that had first been told to Moses and he had been&nbsp;instructed to relay it to Aaron. In this instance also, the&nbsp;substance of the message was to be ultimately relayed to the&nbsp;Jewish people to avoid tragedy through misunderstanding.&nbsp;[Leviticus 10,8 also has G’d speaking (apparently) directly to&nbsp;Aaron, as well a verse 20 in our chapter. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,2. הקרב אתך</span><span class="font5">, “bring near with you, etc.;” the point here is to warn the Levites charged with singing in a choir&nbsp;while the priests presented the offerings, that they do so on&nbsp;the special platform provided for them to stand on at those&nbsp;times. [This platform was outside the Tabernacle. Ed.] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וילוו עליך, </span><span class="font5">“so that they may be joined to you.” The Torah&nbsp;writes this to remind the priests that they are not to co-opt&nbsp;any ordinary Israelites to the Levites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואתה ובניך אתך לפני אהל מועד</span><span class="font5">, “and you and your sons with you in front of the Tent of Testimony.” The priests were to&nbsp;stand inside, the Levites outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזר לא יקרב אליכם, </span><span class="font5">“and a stranger (non Levite or&nbsp;priest) shall not approach you.” We have heard the warning,&nbsp;but where is the penalty for violation spelled out? Look at&nbsp;verse 7, where the Torah spells it out, i.e. והזר הקרב יומת, “and&nbsp;if a stranger approaches (crosses the boundary) he is subject&nbsp;to execution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא יהיה עוד קצף</span><span class="font5">, “so that there will no longer be a&nbsp;wrath;” the word עוד, “again, or in future,” is peculiar as the&nbsp;wrath is already in existence. We have this on the authority&nbsp;of Numbers 17,11: “כי יצא הקצף,” for the wrath has come&nbsp;forth!” The word עוד therefore must mean: “it will not&nbsp;continue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.6. </span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכם מתנה נתונים לה</span><span class="font5">, “for you the Levites, they are given as a gift for the Lord.” They are not “given” to you&nbsp;priests as personal servants, but to the Lord, and at the&nbsp;disposal of the priests in their capacity as His representative&nbsp;on earth. The priests may not use the Levites to perform&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">personal</span><span class="font5"> chores for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולמבית לפרכת</span><span class="font5">, “and to that which is beyond the&nbsp;dividing curtain.” We learn from here that there was an area&nbsp;behind the dividing curtain which served as a place where&nbsp;the priests could be examined as to their status as priests.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עבודת מתנה</span><span class="font5">, “a service performed voluntarily, as a “gift;” just as accumulated gifts to the priests from the common&nbsp;people were distributed by lot, so lots were also drawn as to&nbsp;which priests would be privileged to perform which part of the&nbsp;Temple service. No one could arrogate to himself to&nbsp;determine his personal preference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והזר הקרב</span><span class="font5">, “and a non priest or Levite who dared to approach into the sacred domain, etc.” The Torah speaks of&nbsp;such a stranger presuming to perform service within the&nbsp;Temple. Such a stranger would also be punished, even if he&nbsp;had been ritually pure. Even a Levite, if he had presumed to&nbsp;perform Temple service would be subject to the death&nbsp;penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask that we know that Samuel the Levite is reported to have offered service in the Temple (Samuel I&nbsp;7,9), this was due to an emergency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואני הנה נתתי לך</span><span class="font5">, “and as far as I am concerned,&nbsp;behold I have given to you, etc.;” after the institution of the&nbsp;hereditary priesthood had now been established by&nbsp;consensus, the Torah proceeds to list the gifts from the&nbsp;farmers that the priests and the Levites are entitled to, as&nbsp;well as to parts of the people’s offerings in the Temple,&nbsp;seeing that they have no other means of earning a livelihood,&nbsp;not owning any ancestral land. [No priest or Levite is&nbsp;permitted to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">demand</span><span class="font5"> anything personally from an individual&nbsp;farmer. Each farmer is at liberty to “pay” these dues to a&nbsp;Levite or priest of his choosing. Ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכל קדשי בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “parts of any offerings by the Jewish people tendered to G’d.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לך נתתים</span><span class="font5">, “unto you I have given them” (these “gifts.”) They are </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">yours</span><span class="font5"> by right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולבניך אחריך, </span><span class="font5">“and to your children after you.” These gifts to the priests and Levites are ancestral, just as the soil&nbsp;distributed by Joshua to the other tribes were hereditary</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מן האש</span><span class="font5">, “reserved from the fire” (which consumes&nbsp;the remainder of these offerings).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זה יהיה לך מקדש הקדשים</span><span class="font5">, “this is what is yours (priests) of the most holy things;” the Torah proceeds to spell out which&nbsp;parts of the respective animal sacrifices are for the&nbsp;consumption of the priest (and his household). After each&nbsp;category of animal sacrifice and meal offering and its&nbsp;purpose are listed, there follow what is to be saved for the&nbsp;priest or priests. The only category of animal offering of&nbsp;which no part is permitted to be eaten is the burnt offering,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">olah,</span><span class="font5"> and sin offerings presented on the golden altar as&nbsp;distinct from the copper altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,10. בקדש הקדשים תאכלנו</span><span class="font5">, “in a most holy place you shall consume them;” the place meant (normally) is the&nbsp;courtyard of the Temple. The wording here allows for these&nbsp;portions to be eaten by the priests even inside the Sanctuary&nbsp;when the Temple was under siege by infidels. The wording&nbsp;refers to the state of the priests while eating same, compare&nbsp;discussion in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri.</span><span class="font5"> It is “most holy,” compared to other sacred&nbsp;sites of lower rank of holiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,11. תרומת מתנם</span><span class="font5">, “the heave offering of their gift.” The&nbsp;word מתנם has a letter ת missing, and should have been&nbsp;מתנתם. We have parallel phenomena in Job 11,9, ארכה מארץ&nbsp;מדה, instead of ארוכה מארץ מדה, “its measure is longer than the&nbsp;earth;” A similar phenomenon is found in Zecharyah 4,2, וגלה&nbsp;על ראשה, which should have been וגולה על ראשה, “with a bowl&nbsp;above it.” Our author lists a couple more such examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,15. כל פטר רחם לכל בשר</span><span class="font5">, “Everything that opens the womb of all flesh;” this line has appeared in the Torah on&nbsp;three separate occasions. The reason is that the Torah&nbsp;considers the redemption of the firstborn as a most important&nbsp;ritual, so much so that even the firstborn of a ritually impure&nbsp;animal, the donkey, needs to be redeemed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'אשר יקריבו לה</span><span class="font5">, “which the offer unto the Lord;” this line was added in order to exclude the need for redeeming the&nbsp;firstborn males of free roaming beasts. Seeing that free&nbsp;roaming beasts are not fit as sacrifices, there would be no&nbsp;point in having to redeem the first born male of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;קדש הם</span><span class="font5">. “They are holy;” but you will claim the&nbsp;animal itself, whose fat parts are required on the altar,&nbsp;something unique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובשרם יהיה לך</span><span class="font5">, “however, their flesh is yours.” This&nbsp;even includes a blemished firstborn, which is donated to the&nbsp;priest, something we do not find elsewhere in the Torah.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ברית מלח עולם הוא</span><span class="font5">, “it is an everlasting covenant&nbsp;of salt.” The word הוא has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik,</span><span class="font5"> seeing that the&nbsp;noun ברית is a feminine noun. We find something similar in&nbsp;connection with David in Chronicles II 13,5: כי המלוכה לדוד&nbsp;ולזרעו ברית מלח, “for David’s kingship over Israel is forever, to&nbsp;him and his sons by a covenant of salt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אני חלקך</span><span class="font5">, “I am your portion;” G’d is announcing&nbsp;that He, personally, is the priests’ “portion.” [as opposed to&nbsp;terrestrial earth in the Holy Land. Ed.]. Seeing that this is so,&nbsp;you are free, (time-wise) to perform your duties in the&nbsp;Tabernacle/Temple once you are all settled in the Land of&nbsp;Israel. Seeing that you have these duties, you are relieved of&nbsp;the need to work for a living for six days a week, and the&nbsp;many difficulties that this involves. You need not engage in&nbsp;trade and commerce either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ולבני לוי וגו</span><span class="font5">, and as far as the Levites are&nbsp;concerned, etc.” in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> on this verse the letter ו at the&nbsp;beginning of the word ולבני, is a conjunctive letter, linking the&nbsp;basic functions and lifestyle of the Levites to that of the&nbsp;priests to the extent that the special covenant of salt between&nbsp;G’d and the priests includes them also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא יקרבו עוד בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “and the Children of Israel&nbsp;shall no longer come close, etc.” the word עוד here cannot&nbsp;mean “still,” but must mean “again,” as they had already&nbsp;come near as we know from verse 5, else why was G’d&nbsp;described as angry there? (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,24. כי את מעשר בני ישראל </span><span class="font5">, “but (instead) the tithes of the Children of Israel.” The reason why the word מעשר is&nbsp;vocalised with a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach</span><span class="font5"> under the letter ש instead of the&nbsp;usual vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’zeyreh,</span><span class="font5"> is that it is in the construct mode to the&nbsp;expression בני ישראל.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בנחלתכם</span><span class="font5">, “as your inheritance;” in lieu of a piece&nbsp;of land as an inheritance. This is why you have to tithe the&nbsp;tithes you receive from the Israelite farmer also as if it had&nbsp;been your inheritance of an ancestral piece of land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכמלאה מן היקב</span><span class="font5">, “as though it were the corn from&nbsp;the threshing floor.” Both wine and oil are called מלאה, seeing&nbsp;that the container into which it is poured cannot be filled&nbsp;beyond the rim. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כן תרימו</span><span class="font5">, “thus you shall set apart, etc.” just as&nbsp;the Israelites do. [They have to set the tithes etc. apart&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the remainder may be consumed or used by the&nbsp;farmer who grew the crop.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מכל מעשרותיכם</span><span class="font5">, “of all your tithes;” i.e. from all the other tithes that you are obligated to give away, and which are&nbsp;subject to tithes from the fields which have grown for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18,29</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מכל מתנותיכם תרימו</span><span class="font5">, “out of all that has been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">given </span><span class="font5">to you, you must set aside, etc.; this is to teach you that even&nbsp;what grows on the fields which have been allocated to the&nbsp;Levites as a kind of enlarged garden adjoining their houses,&nbsp;the Levites are obligated to give tithes to the priests. The&nbsp;Levite is not allowed to claim that he need not tithe what he&nbsp;has himself grown on these plots, using logic to support their&nbsp;argument. His logic would run as follows: “seeing that I&nbsp;receive from others part of what </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> have grown, surely I am&nbsp;entitled to keep what I have grown myself with the sweat of&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">my</span><span class="font5"> brow.” This is why the Torah emphasises that everything&nbsp;that the Levite has been allocated by the Torah is in the&nbsp;nature of a “gift,” מתנותיכם, “a gift for you,“ you did not have to&nbsp;labour hard in order to obtain it. Compare the text of the&nbsp;Torah in Numbers 35, 2: ומגרש לערים סביבותיכם </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">תתנו</span><span class="font5"> ללוים, “and&nbsp;open land round about of the cities inhabited by the Levites&nbsp;you shall </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">give</span><span class="font5"> to the Levites. “</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מכל חלבו את מקדשי ממנו</span><span class="font5">, “of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.” This is a reference to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah,</span><span class="font5"> the 2% (average) given to the priest from the gross&nbsp;amount of the harvest, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the tithe is set aside for the&nbsp;Levite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אתם וביתכם </span><span class="font5">“you and your households;” this&nbsp;includes the larger family, based on the patriarch of each&nbsp;family, who is considered the head within his tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">18.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת קדשי בני ישראל לא תחללו ולא תמותו</span><span class="font5">, “and the&nbsp;holy things of the Children of Israel you shall not profane so&nbsp;that you will not die.” Once you have set aside the tithes&nbsp;there is no danger of your having profaned the holy things or&nbsp;of your dying on account of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the 24 different items designated as gift to the priests are completely secular and will not be subject to the&nbsp;rules of holy items that have been desecrated. Of these 24&nbsp;categories of “gifts,” 12 were given to the priests in&nbsp;Jerusalem, the other 12 in any part of the Holy Land. Our&nbsp;author lists all the 24 items here once more, [but I see no&nbsp;reason to repeat what has been spelled out by the Torah. Ed.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Chukat</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זאת חקת התורה</span><span class="font5">, “This is the statute of the law of the&nbsp;Torah;” The “statute” referred to here are the laws of ritual&nbsp;defilement and subsequent rites of purification. They were&nbsp;communicated to the people on the first day of Nissan, on&nbsp;the day the Tabernacle was erected ready for service.&nbsp;(Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin</span><span class="font5"> folio 60). It had to be communicated&nbsp;on that day, as on the following day the red heifer, the&nbsp;instrument without which purification could not take place,&nbsp;was burned. Without knowledge of these procedures, the&nbsp;Passover, which would be offered on the fourteenth day of&nbsp;that month could not have been offered. The Torah had&nbsp;stipulated in verse 4 of our chapter that the location for the&nbsp;sprinkling of the waters containing the ash of that red heifer&nbsp;was opposite, i.e. facing the Tabernacle. It had to be inserted&nbsp;here as there were people, who as a result of the rebellion of&nbsp;Korach had become ritually contaminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'אשר צוה ה, </span><span class="font5">“which the Lord had commanded;” we do not find where the Lord had commanded this previously, a&nbsp;phenomenon we referred to already in our commentary on&nbsp;Exodus 10,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקחו אליך</span><span class="font5">, “they shall bring to you;” seeing that the priests had been charged with ensuring that the Tabernacle&nbsp;precincts would not be breached by unauthorised Israelites,&nbsp;they had to be provided with the means to purify people who&nbsp;had violated these rules through ignorance or carelessness.&nbsp;This is also what is meant in verse 3, where G’d includes&nbsp;Elazar, Aaron’s, son as a recipient of this red heifer who is to&nbsp;attend to the ritual involving it. It is a gift to the priests from&nbsp;the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתתם אותה אל אלעזר הכהן</span><span class="font5">, “you (pl.) are to give it&nbsp;(the red heifer) to the priest Elazar. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains why this&nbsp;procedure was entrusted to Elazar, whereas all future red&nbsp;heifers were slaughtered etc., either by the High Priest or&nbsp;even an ordinary priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators, explaining the plain meaning of our verse, suggest that seeing that handling the red heifer&nbsp;would contaminate the High Priest, so that he would be&nbsp;incapable of performing his duties for at least seven days,&nbsp;the task was entrusted to his deputy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here, the deputy High Priest was entrusted with this task; according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> meaning that he was in overall&nbsp;charge of the entire ritual. He took the heifer out of the camp,&nbsp;slaughtered it, took some of its blood, sprinkling it in the&nbsp;direction of the Tabernacle, appointed a ritually pure man&nbsp;and deposited the ash of the heifer after it had been burnt in&nbsp;the vessel assigned for this. He took a little branch from a&nbsp;cedar tree and some hyssop, plus some red wool and cast it&nbsp;into the flames surrounding the red heifer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוציא אותה</span><span class="font5">, “he will transport it (the red heifer) outside the camp; this verse has been abbreviated, seeing that the&nbsp;Torah did not tell us who was to take the red heifer outside&nbsp;the camp. Neither did it name who performed the other tasks,&nbsp;slaughtering, burning, collecting ashes, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושחט אותה לפניו</span><span class="font5">, “he is to slaughter it in his presence.” The reference is to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Elazar’s</span><span class="font5"> presence. At this point, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">adds that a non priest, a layman, performed the slaughtering.&nbsp;Some versions add that Elazar was watching this procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Apparently </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> point was to inform us that the slaughtering did not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">require</span><span class="font5"> to be performed by the deputy&nbsp;High Priest. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> in Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 45, as&nbsp;well as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum</span><span class="font5"> Yonatan ben Uzziel). It is not unusual to&nbsp;describe the task performed by an ordinary priest as having&nbsp;been performed by a “stranger,” i.e. not a high ranking priest.&nbsp;[There had been only three priests at that time. Ed.] The&nbsp;term: זר may be understood as “layman,” not a ranking&nbsp;official. We find an example of this in the Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Batra,</span><span class="font5"> folio 110. [The subject under discussion there is&nbsp;a misunderstanding concerning this word having more than&nbsp;one possible meaning. עבודה זרה was understood as idolatry&nbsp;there, whereas it was supposed to mean: “unfamiliar work.”&nbsp;According to Rabbi Yitzchok, slaughter of the red heifer by a&nbsp;non priest was inadmissible.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,4. ולקח אלעזר הכהן והזה</span><span class="font5">, “Elazar the priest is to take from the blood and sprinkle;” at this stage it appeared as if&nbsp;the sprinkling of the blood was the most important part of the&nbsp;ritual, and required the deputy High Priest to perform it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.5. ושרף את הפרה לעיניו</span><span class="font5">, “someone is to burn the red&nbsp;heifer in the presence of Elazar.” Elazar’s watching the&nbsp;procedure is equivalent to the Torah having written: “the&nbsp;deputy High Priest is to watch this procedure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את עורה</span><span class="font5">, “its skin,” including the hair on the skin;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת בשרה</span><span class="font5">, “and its flesh;” including its bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת דמה</span><span class="font5">,”and its blood,” including its horns and claws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על פרשה</span><span class="font5">, “together with its entrails containing their dung.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have a parallel to this kind of construction in Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">12,9, where the Torah writes: ראשו על כרעיו ועל קרבו, “its head,&nbsp;its legs and its entrails.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל תוך</span><span class="font5">, “into the midst of the burning heifer.” The&nbsp;words אל תוך were used instead of the prefix letter ב. The&nbsp;Torah uses a similar construction both in Exodus 25,16, אל&nbsp;הארון, “into the ark,” instead of בארון, and in verse 17 in our&nbsp;chapter אל כלי, “into a vessel,” instead of בכלי.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.7. וכבס בגדיו הכהן</span><span class="font5">, “and he shall wash the priests’ clothing,” (in a ritual bath,) This refers to the same person&nbsp;who had thrown the parts of the slaughtered red heifer into&nbsp;the fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;השורף אותה יכבס את בגדיו</span><span class="font5">, “the person who had&nbsp;burned the red heifer is to immerse his clothing in a ritual&nbsp;bath;” (as well as his body). According to the plain meaning&nbsp;of the text, the people handling the red heifer did not have to&nbsp;immerse their clothing in a ritual bath prior to these activities,&nbsp;as at that point its purpose could not have appeared to&nbsp;onlookers as different from presenting other animal offerings,&nbsp;all of which require slaughtering of the animal in question and&nbsp;sprinkling its blood. The Torah described the final stages of&nbsp;this ritual before having completed describing the task of the&nbsp;man burning the red heifer, seeing this part of the ritual&nbsp;occurred prior to the completion of all the steps he was to&nbsp;perform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואסף איש טהור</span><span class="font5">, “and a man who is ritually clean is&nbsp;to collect, etc.” According to the plain text I might have&nbsp;thought that seeing that the man who had burned the parts of&nbsp;the red heifer had already become ritually contaminated, that&nbsp;he was the one who should also now collect the ash of the&nbsp;red heifer. Why would another person have to do that and&nbsp;also become ritually contaminated in the process? The Torah&nbsp;therefore had to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">spell out </span><span class="font5">that a man who had not become&nbsp;ritually contaminated had to perform that task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והניח מחוץ למחנה</span><span class="font5">, “and he is to deposit it outside the camp;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> that for the future this means that&nbsp;the High Priests will undergo their purification rites on Mount&nbsp;Olives, as part of that ash will be stored there. Future rituals&nbsp;involving the red heifer will also take place there, i.e. people&nbsp;who had become ritually contaminated by this ritual would&nbsp;also undergo their purification rites there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,10. וכבס האוסף</span><span class="font5">, “and he that gathers the ashes shall&nbsp;wash his clothes (in a ritual bath);” according to the plain&nbsp;meaning of the text, the person gathering in the ash is&nbsp;required to do this, whereas the person depositing it outside&nbsp;the camp is not required to do this before aJi the stages of the&nbsp;ritual have been concluded. Seeing that it is physically&nbsp;impossible to collect the ashes in such a manner that none of&nbsp;is blown away by the wind, and contaminates the garments&nbsp;of the person handling it in the process, and the ash itself is&nbsp;holy, and it might end up in a ritually contaminated area, the&nbsp;person handling it will require immersing his clothing in a&nbsp;ritual bath earlier, similar to what the Torah described in&nbsp;connection with the sin offering in Leviticus 6,20: ואשר יזה ממנו&nbsp;מדמה על הבגד תכבס, “and anything he sprinkles from it (by&nbsp;mistake) on his garment you must immerse in a ritual bath in&nbsp;holy location” What was written there also applies to other&nbsp;kinds of animals whose bodies had to be burned for one&nbsp;reason or another, (because their meat was not consumed in&nbsp;time, etc.) and therefore it is clear that the same procedure is&nbsp;required here, even though it has not been specifically&nbsp;spelled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכבס האוסף</span><span class="font5">, “why did this detail have to be written here at all? If the person who only sprinkles blood with the hyssop&nbsp;contaminates his clothing when any of the blood touches his&nbsp;garments, and he therefore has to purify it in a ritual bath, is&nbsp;it not logical that the same rule applies to the person&nbsp;collecting the ash of the red heifer, who is far more likely to&nbsp;have had his clothing come into touch with some of that&nbsp;ash?” We would have to answer that we apply the rule that&nbsp;penalties can not be decreed by the Torah unless they had&nbsp;been spelled out. Using logic is not enough for this. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: The Torah teaches us here about the concept of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tumat hesset,</span><span class="font5"> that though a ritually&nbsp;contaminated person may even involuntarily transfer such&nbsp;contamination by just moving objects by body movements&nbsp;without touching them with his hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although concerning other holy objects, once they have been reduced to ashes, their holiness has ceased, and the&nbsp;ash cannot confer impurity, in the case of the red heifer this&nbsp;is not so. This is in order to warn us not to come into contact&nbsp;with it, other than for its purpose to help a ritually&nbsp;contaminated person to regain purity when the procedures&nbsp;outlined in this chapter have been followed meticulously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכבס האוסף את בגדיו, </span><span class="font5">“and the person who has collected this ash has to immerse his garments in a ritual bath.” If even&nbsp;his clothing has to undergo purification in a ritual bath, how&nbsp;much more so does his body have to undergo such a&nbsp;process! We also know this from the Torah having written:&nbsp;וטמא עד הערב, “he remains ritually impure until evening,” i.e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> having immersed himself in a ritual bath, (verse 19)&nbsp;where he is declared as ritually pure as a result of the sun&nbsp;having set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find a parallel to this sequence in verse 19 where the stages are: “the ritually pure person will sprinkle water&nbsp;containing the ash of the red heifer on the ritually impure&nbsp;person, who will proceed to immerse his clothing in a ritual&nbsp;bath and wash with water, as a result of which he will regain&nbsp;his ritual purity in the evening.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הנוגע במת, </span><span class="font5">“if someone has been in physical&nbsp;contact with a corpse, etc.;” why does this have to be spelled&nbsp;out, when we have already been told that even being in an&nbsp;enclosed room sharing the same air space with the corpse,&nbsp;he has become contaminated? The answer to this question&nbsp;is the same as above when we stated that penalties in the&nbsp;Torah cannot be imposed as the result of our using our&nbsp;mental faculties, unless the Torah has spelled this out </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הוא יתחטא בו</span><span class="font5">, “the same person shall purify&nbsp;himself;” with this ash. If someone were to pose the question:&nbsp;what is the logic behind a red heifer on the one hand being&nbsp;the instrument for purifying the ritually impure, while at the&nbsp;same time conferring ritual impurity on its handlers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We could answer as follows: we find something similar in nature, where one and the same object performs two&nbsp;diametrically opposite functions. Fire, i.e. heat, melts metal,&nbsp;whereas the same fire when used to boil eggs makes the&nbsp;interior of these eggs get harder as time proceeds while it is&nbsp;in the pot. [We have not heard anyone criticising </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">nature</span><span class="font5"> for&nbsp;performing such contradictory functions, so why criticise the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Creator</span><span class="font5"> for legislating something parallel? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find a similar phenomenon in medicine. A medicine which heals a sick person, makes a healthy person sick&nbsp;when he swallows it. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> in the Talmud, tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pessachim</span><span class="font5"> on folio 42 quotes such examples with cures for&nbsp;diarrhea. The cure, when taken by a healthy person, brings&nbsp;on that very ailment. Knowing this, we have no reason to&nbsp;question why the Creator saw fit to introduce such a concept&nbsp;into His Torah legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, we find in books on natural science (hinted at in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beytzah</span><span class="font5"> folio 43), that if one&nbsp;places water into a vessel made of white glass, and exposes&nbsp;it to sunshine it will eventually burst into fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואם לא יתחטא ביום השלשי</span><span class="font5">, but if he does not purify himself on the third day, etc,” what is the reason for this clause after&nbsp;the Torah had already written that the ritual for purification&nbsp;involves sprinkling of the water containing the ash of the red&nbsp;heifer on him on the third and seventh day? I might have&nbsp;thought that if he had forgotten to undergo this procedure on&nbsp;the third day, he could perform it twice on the seventh day;&nbsp;the Torah decrees that this is not acceptable, as three days&nbsp;have to elapse between the first sprinkling and the second&nbsp;sprinkling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,13. עוד טומאתו בו</span><span class="font5">, “his ritual impurity is still part of him.” He should not say to himself that seeing that if after&nbsp;seven days of counting this did not avail him anything to&nbsp;enter the sacred precincts around the Temple, at least it was&nbsp;good enough so that if he comes into contact with people, at&nbsp;least he will not transfer his ritual contamination to them; the&nbsp;Torah therefore states that having only performed </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">part</span><span class="font5"> of the&nbsp;ritual is completely ineffective, he is as contaminated as&nbsp;previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,14. זאת התורה</span><span class="font5">, “this is the law;” what has been&nbsp;introduced at the beginning of this chapter is a statute of the&nbsp;Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל הבא אל האהל</span><span class="font5">, “anyone who enters the tent (or house) in which there is a body of a human being, (and any item in&nbsp;the house at the time);” the reason that this has been spelled&nbsp;out is that you could have thought that ritual impurity&nbsp;originating in a dead body is transferred </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> through&nbsp;touching that body, but not through sharing the air under the&nbsp;same roof as that in which the body reposes. The novelty of&nbsp;this legislation is such that it needs to be spelled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל אשר באהל</span><span class="font5">, “and everything inside that tent (or house).” Why did this have to be written? if the Torah&nbsp;declared anyone entering such a tent as becoming ritually&nbsp;impure, i.e. before he had even entered with his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">whole</span><span class="font5"> body,&nbsp;it is understood that things inside that tent already and&nbsp;completely, will have the same status, no less. The answer is&nbsp;again that a penalty for something must be spelled out, and&nbsp;cannot be decreed merely by reasoning, however logical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand the line: כל הבא אל האהל, as including even living creatures other than human&nbsp;beings that are in that tent at the same time as the corpse is&nbsp;still there. The same would be true for chattels that had been&nbsp;in that tent while the corpse was still alive. (Source unknown)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,16. וכל אשר יגע על פני השדה</span><span class="font5">, “and anyone in an open field who touches, etc.;” seeing that it is under open skies,&nbsp;only actual touching of the body confers ritual impurity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בחלל חרב</span><span class="font5">, “regardless if death occurred as a result of the sword,” you should not say that the Torah had ruled only&nbsp;natural death as conferring ritual impurity on those touching&nbsp;the corpse, not unnatural death such as by violence of any&nbsp;kind, instruments designed to be used as weapons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או בעצם אדם, </span><span class="font5">“or by a human bone,” this verse teaches that in order to confer ritual impurity the corpse does not to&nbsp;be whole, even a bone suffices to confer such impurity (if a&nbsp;little flesh or skin is attached to it). The impurity this conferred&nbsp;on a person last a minimum of seven days even when all the&nbsp;rules of purification have been observed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או בעצם אדם או בקבר</span><span class="font5">, “or direct contact with the bone of a human being, or contact with a grave;” of all the types of&nbsp;ritual impurity the one caused by a human copse is the most&nbsp;severe. This is why the sages define a human corpse as אבי&nbsp;אבות הטומאה, ”the original forefather of all ritual impurities.”&nbsp;The reason appears to be that the Torah wishes to insure&nbsp;that living human beings not spend their time with the&nbsp;corpses out of their love for the departed, nor out of the&nbsp;mistaken belief that these corpses could reveal secrets of the&nbsp;afterlife to them, or that they would make idols of the skins of&nbsp;such corpses, seeing that the skins could be preserved&nbsp;indefinitely when turned into leather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternately, they would demean their parents by making utensils out of their skins or bones, the very reverse of&nbsp;revering them. Even if the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">motivation</span><span class="font5"> is simply to treat the&nbsp;dead with respect, the Torah prohibits this as not the way to&nbsp;mourn and show respect for one’s ancestors. [The Nazis&nbsp;have demonstrated how by making lampshades out of Jews’&nbsp;skins, they had found dead Jews useful, whereas they had&nbsp;no use for living Jews. Ed.] Our sages in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yadayim,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">chapter 4, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> 6, already forbade making carpets out of&nbsp;human skins, i.e. walking on the skins of their parents. They&nbsp;similarly forbade using one’s parents’ bones to convert them&nbsp;into spoons and similar utensils. All of this is forbidden even&nbsp;if intended to be proof of how </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">beloved</span><span class="font5"> one’s parents had&nbsp;been by their children, so that they felt the need to keep part&nbsp;of them around to remind them of their having existed. This&nbsp;may be why the bones of donkeys are not ritually unclean&nbsp;and do not confer ritual contamination, while the bones of&nbsp;one’s parents are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.18. ועל הנגע בעצם</span><span class="font5">, “and on someone who had touched the bones of the dead.” The letter ב in the word בעצם&nbsp;has the definitive vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz,</span><span class="font5"> as it refers to the word עצם&nbsp;in verse 16, i.e. only human bones. This is also the reason&nbsp;why the vowel under the words בקבר, and במת have the&nbsp;definitive vowels </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach</span><span class="font5"> in our verse. Each refers to a&nbsp;previously mentioned grave or corpse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19.19. 'והזה הטהור על הטמא ביום השלישי וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and the ritually pure person shall sprinkle on the ritually contaminated&nbsp;person on the third day, etc.: previously the Torah had&nbsp;spoken of people who had touched a whole corpse; here the&nbsp;Torah speak of people who had touched only parts of a&nbsp;corpse, such as a bone, or merely had visited the grave and&nbsp;therefore presumably been in the same airspace as the&nbsp;dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,20. ואיש אשר יטמא ולא יתחטא, </span><span class="font5">“but the man that shall become ritually contaminated and does not take steps to&nbsp;purify himself, etc.;” the reason for this verse is unclear as&nbsp;the substance of it has already appeared in verse 13, where&nbsp;the Torah spoke of such a person having entered sacred&nbsp;areas around the Temple, and having become guilty of&nbsp;contaminating that area, and deserving punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah wishes to make clear that we should not think that the penalty of which the Torah spoke in verse 13&nbsp;applies only if such a ritually contaminated person entered&nbsp;sacred domains after having previously </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">touched</span><span class="font5"> the dead,&nbsp;not if he had only been in the same covered airspace with&nbsp;the dead, when he would not be punished with extermination&nbsp;of his family; therefore the Torah repeats this legislation here.&nbsp;[Anyone who is not a priest is not obligated to cleanse&nbsp;himself from ritual impurity until he has to make the&nbsp;pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the festivals, or unless for one&nbsp;reason or another he is obligated to offer a sacrifice. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have now heard about the penalty for failing to purify oneself, where did we have the commandment to do&nbsp;so? We find it in Numbers 5,2: “anyone stricken with a&nbsp;serious degree of ritual impurity has to be sent outside the&nbsp;camp of the Israelites.” Who would like to remain ostracised?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי את מקדש ה' טמא</span><span class="font5">, for he has ritually contaminated G’d’s Temple.” He did so when entering its precincts while in a&nbsp;state of ritual impurity.” Why did the Torah in verse 13 speak&nbsp;of the person having contaminated the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Tabernacle</span><span class="font5">, and here&nbsp;it speaks of the person having contaminated the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Temple</span><span class="font5">?&nbsp;Are they not two sides of the same coin? If the Torah had&nbsp;only written this about the Tabernacle, I would have thought&nbsp;that the sanctity of the Tabernacle is greater, as it had been&nbsp;anointed with the oil of anointing. If the Torah had written this&nbsp;only about the Temple, I would have thought that the sanctity&nbsp;of the Temple was greater than that of the Tabernacle, as the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tabernacle was designed only as a temporary structure. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shevuot,</span><span class="font5"> folio 16).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,21. ומזה מי הנדה יכבס בגדיו</span><span class="font5">, “and the person who sprinkles the waters containing the ash of the red heifer,&nbsp;called here מי הנה, “water designed to purify by removing the&nbsp;offending substance.” This verse has been abbreviated; its&nbsp;meaning is as follows: “the waters designed to remove the&nbsp;offending substance;” however, the person coming into&nbsp;contact with these waters must subsequently immerse&nbsp;himself in a ritual bath, as well as his clothing, and he&nbsp;remains in a state of ritual impurity until the evening of that&nbsp;day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנוגע במי הנדה יטמא</span><span class="font5">, “anyone coming into contact with that water will become ritually unclean.” This is the answer to&nbsp;the deviationist cults among Jews who claim that the reason&nbsp;why the red heifer confers ritual impurity on all the people&nbsp;involved with it, is, because the whole ritual was performed&nbsp;outside the camp of the Jews. They claim that if people&nbsp;involved with it would not become ritually impure, we are&nbsp;afraid that anyone could henceforth claim a special status of&nbsp;superior sanctity for himself and take from the ash of the cow&nbsp;and sprinkle himself with this “holy” water, claiming that&nbsp;thereby they would achieve a higher degree of purity. To&nbsp;forestall such practices, the Torah decreed that everyone&nbsp;involved with the red heifer would become ritually unclean as&nbsp;an immediate result of this. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask that if a mere sprinkling of the water caused ritual impurity, should not direct physical contact,&nbsp;touching it, do so even more so? So why did this have to be&nbsp;spelled out in our verse? The answer is again that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">penalties&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">for incorrect behaviour must have been spelled out, and&nbsp;cannot be meted out when based only on our logic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am not like many commentators who query the words of our sages, all of which are words of truth; [Our author is&nbsp;absolutely correct. [This editor has never come across a&nbsp;commentator whose work he has translated, in which some&nbsp;of these commentators have not only disagreed with the&nbsp;words of their colleagues usually of former years, so that&nbsp;these commentators could no longer defend their opinions,&nbsp;but they even questioned those commentators’ very&nbsp;legitimacy, and berated them. Ed.] Nonetheless, I cannot&nbsp;conceal that I am puzzled by a statement in the tractate פרה,&nbsp;chapter </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">3, mishnah</span><span class="font5"> 3, where we read that at the entrance to&nbsp;the עזרה, courtyard of the Temple, was set ready a pitcher of&nbsp;the ashes of the red heifer, a sin offering, and they brought a&nbsp;male from the sheep, and tied a rope between its horns and&nbsp;they tied at the end of the rope a stick with a pine cone and&nbsp;threw it into the pitcher, and the male was struck so that it fell&nbsp;over backwards, and he took it and sanctified it so that the&nbsp;ashes became visible above the waters in the pitcher to the&nbsp;onlookers. [The purpose of all this was to avoid the person&nbsp;handling the ashes to have to touch it personally and thus&nbsp;contract ritual impurity. Eliezer Ha-Kalir composed a liturgical&nbsp;poem based on the text of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mishnah,</span><span class="font5"> recited in many&nbsp;synagogues in the morning prayer on the Shabbat on which&nbsp;this section of the Torah is especially read out of turn shortly&nbsp;before Passover. Ed.] According to our author that everyone&nbsp;involved in these procedures requires to have himself&nbsp;sprinkled in order to regain ritual purity, how can the last&nbsp;person in the chain regain it? By whom will he be sprinkled?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Rabbi Chavell in his annotations quotes the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 14 as answering this by saying that a minor who&nbsp;is not subject to becoming ritually impure was used to do&nbsp;this. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">19,22. וכל אשר יגע בו הטמא יטמא</span><span class="font5">, “and whatsoever the ritually contaminated person touches will be unclean as a&nbsp;result.” Our verse speaks of people touching the person still&nbsp;in contact with the corpse. Seeing that the chain had not&nbsp;been broken, that person will also incur severe ritual&nbsp;contamination, i.e. requiring not just a ritual bath to cleanse&nbsp;himself, but the whole procedure, as if he himself had been&nbsp;in contact with the corpse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">והנפש הנוגעת, “and anyone touching a person who had become contaminated by contact with the corpse but was no&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">longer</span><span class="font5"> touching same at that time, will confer a milder degree&nbsp;of ritual impurity on those touching him, who will only have to&nbsp;immerse themselves in a ritual, bath and become&nbsp;automatically pure again in the evening</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,1. ויבאו בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “The Children of |srael arrived, etc.;” the arrival of which the Torah speaks were was during&nbsp;the fortieth year of their wanderings. Their lengthy detour</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">around the territory of Edom who had denied them passage and whom G’d had not allowed them to harass in any way,&nbsp;had now been completed. It had commenced at Kadesh&nbsp;Barnea, and was concluded in the desert of Tzin. The Torah&nbsp;summarises this period here although it comprised 18&nbsp;separate moves during which the Tabernacle had been&nbsp;erected and taken apart each time. In Numbers 33, 19-36,&nbsp;the details of these moves have been recorded for posterity.&nbsp;The first encampment was at a place called Ritmah, the last&nbsp;at the edge of the desert of Tzin. Concerning that period we&nbsp;read Moses recalling in Deuteronomy 2,5: ונפן ונסע המדברה דרך&nbsp;ים סוף ונסב את הר שעיר ימים רבים, “we turned around and&nbsp;journeyed toward the desert in the region of the sea of reeds&nbsp;and marched around Mount Seir, for many years.” That&nbsp;period concluded there in verse 8 with: “we detoured our&nbsp;brethren the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, from the way&nbsp;of the Aravah from Eilat to Etzion Gaver.” From there they&nbsp;arrived at Kadesh, boundary of the Kingdom of Edom, as&nbsp;stated in Numbers 33, 36: “they journeyed from Etzion Gaver&nbsp;and encamped at the desert of Tzin, at Kadesh. What is&nbsp;missing here is only G’d’s warning not to harass the people&nbsp;of Edom (Compare Deuteronomy 2,5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישב העם בקדש</span><span class="font5">, “the people had settled down at Kadesh;” they remained there for four months until the month of Av&nbsp;when they arrived at Mount </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hahar,</span><span class="font5"> where Aaron died. This&nbsp;was not the same Kadesh as the one mentioned in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 1,46, as at that Kadesh they stayed for many&nbsp;years. (19 years according to our sages.) It was the Kadesh&nbsp;from where the spies had been dispatched on their ill fated&nbsp;expedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותמה שם מרים</span><span class="font5">, ”Miriam died there;” seeing that the dying of the people condemned to die as a result of their&nbsp;acceptance of the spies’ majority report had commenced&nbsp;there, Miriam’s death as well as Aaron’s, is also reported at&nbsp;this juncture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,2. ויקהלו על משה ועל אהרן</span><span class="font5">, “and they assembled together against Moses and Aaron.” They were not punished&nbsp;at this stage as during other complaints, as they were&nbsp;justified in complaining for having no water.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,8. קח את המטה</span><span class="font5">, “take the staff!” G’d referred to Aaron’s staff. This is clear from what the Torah writes: Moses&nbsp;took the staff that had been in the presence of the Lord, i.e.&nbsp;in the Tabernacle, the staff that had produced almonds in&nbsp;Numbers 17,23. Compare also Numbers 17,25, where&nbsp;Moses had been told to return his staff to the Tabernacle as&nbsp;an ongoing reminder to the obstinate community of Israel&nbsp;that a member of his family had been chosen to be High&nbsp;Priest. It was appropriate for this staff to be used again when&nbsp;dealing with a people that were in a rebellious mood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this episode Moses committed his first error when he took the wrong staff, seeing that he thought he was&nbsp;supposed to strike the rock. The only reason that G’d had&nbsp;told Moses to take this staff, was that it had been used in&nbsp;conjunction with the rebelliousness of the Jewish people, as&nbsp;opposed to the obstinacy of Pharaoh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ודברתם אל הסלע</span><span class="font5">, “and speak to the rock (pl.).” The prefix ה before the word: הסלע teaches that the rock involved was&nbsp;the one that used to provide water for the people as long as&nbsp;Miriam had been alive. The people would draw their water&nbsp;from that rock. It used to move with the people whenever&nbsp;they moved. This was the rock that Moses now struck and&nbsp;that refused to yield its water on account of Miriam having&nbsp;died. It resumed yielding water due to the merit of Moses and&nbsp;Aaron, as our sages have explained in the Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Taanit,</span><span class="font5"> folio 9. This is why G’d told </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">both </span><span class="font5">Moses and Aaron to&nbsp;speak to the rock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators understand what happened during this episode as follows: the words: ודברתם אל הסלע refer to&nbsp;what occurred in Exodus 17,7; this is totally erroneous, if only&nbsp;since there the Torah never used the expression סלע when&nbsp;speaking about the rock, but only the term צור. Moreover, it is&nbsp;clear that that episode occurred near Mount Sinai, as the&nbsp;Torah testifies that the waters emanated from the rock known&nbsp;as Chorev. (Exodus 17,6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתן מימיו</span><span class="font5">, “it will yield its natural waters,” i.e. just a few drops, as a result of being spoken to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והוצאת להם מים</span><span class="font5">, “you will extract for them water;” i.e. a great quantity of water, by striking the rock. According to that&nbsp;view, the reason why G’d had told Moses to take along the&nbsp;staff, although on the face of it sounded as if quantities of&nbsp;water would be released from the rock by merely speaking to&nbsp;it, was that it had never been intended that more than a few&nbsp;drops of the rock’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">own</span><span class="font5"> moisture would be released by&nbsp;speaking to it. Moses had misunderstood G’d, as he was&nbsp;upset at the time so that he had never spoken to the rock at&nbsp;all, apart from not having known which of the numerous&nbsp;rocks all around he was to address. The critical rock was&nbsp;surrounded by many others which all looked alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?המן הסלע הזה נוציא לכם מים, </span><span class="font5">“Are we supposed to&nbsp;extract water for you from this rock?” The Israelites&nbsp;understood Moses’ exclamation at face value, i.e. that he&nbsp;thought that it was quite impossible to extract water from the&nbsp;rock he pointed at, (or they had pointed at). Actually, what&nbsp;Moses had meant to say was: “did you think that what we are&nbsp;going to do to this rock is the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font5"> as what we did for your&nbsp;fathers 40 years ago, i.e. by striking it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d’s command to speak to the rock was precisely to teach them that it was not even necessary to strike the rock.&nbsp;Moses had not been precise in his exclamation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וין* את הסלע</span><span class="font5">, “he struck the rock with his staff&nbsp;twice.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> explanation here is too short when he writes&nbsp;that after the first </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">strike</span><span class="font5"> the rock produced only a few drops of&nbsp;water, Moses struck the rock again and then it produced&nbsp;ample amounts of water because G’d had never instructed&nbsp;him to hit the rock at all, but had said to Moses and Aaron:&nbsp;“speak to the rock.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> they then spoke to&nbsp;another rock. The result was that no water emerged from that&nbsp;rock at all. They then thought that this second rock should&nbsp;have been struck just like the first one, and when they&nbsp;proceeded to do this a lot of water came out. When the rock&nbsp;had failed to produce water, they had thought that they must&nbsp;have spoken to the wrong rock. (Our author amends what he&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">thought</span><span class="font5"> that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> had meant to write)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לכן לא תביאו</span><span class="font5">, “therefore you will not bring, etc.”&nbsp;Whenever the expression לכן, appears, it indicates that the&nbsp;speaker is saying something in the nature of an oath.&nbsp;Compare: Samuel I 3,14: לכן נשבעתי לבית עלי, “therefore I have&nbsp;sworn concerning the house of Eli;” compare also</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deuteronomy 4,21: וישבע לבלתי עברי, “therefore He swore that I may not cross, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to query that we read at the end of Exodus 6,7 that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains the words: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">עתה</span><span class="font5"> תראה, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">“now y</span><span class="font5">ou will&nbsp;see,” that Moses, while witnessing the Exodus from Egypt,&nbsp;will not witness the crossing of the Jordan into the land of&nbsp;Canaan, (as a penalty for having questioned G’d’s handling&nbsp;of the Israelites since his appointment as their leader) he had&nbsp;already forfeited the right to cross into the land of Israel 40&nbsp;years earlier, so what is new about G’d’s oath here? We may&nbsp;answer that both incidents </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">combined </span><span class="font5">to deny him entry to&nbsp;the Holy land; [alternately, in Exodus, the matter had only&nbsp;been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hinted</span><span class="font5"> at, (thus preventing Moses from apologizing and&nbsp;doing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">teshuvah)</span><span class="font5"> and had not been confirmed by G’d with an&nbsp;oath thus making it irrevocable. Ed.].</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקדש בם</span><span class="font5">, “He was sanctified through them.” The&nbsp;phenomenon that caused G’d to become sanctified here was&nbsp;the water that came forth from the rock. (Not in accordance&nbsp;with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)</span><span class="font5"> As a result, the name of this place henceforth&nbsp;was </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kadesh,</span><span class="font5"> a sanctified location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישלח משה מלאכים</span><span class="font5">, “Moses dispatched&nbsp;messengers;” the Torah here explains in detail what Moses&nbsp;refers to in Deuteronomy at the beginning of chapter two&nbsp;there. Some details missing there have been supplied here,&nbsp;whereas others have been augmented there but omitted&nbsp;here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בקדש עיר גבולך, </span><span class="font5">“at Kadesh, a town on the border&nbsp;of your Kingdom.” This was at the southeastern end of the&nbsp;land of Canaan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא נשתה מי באר</span><span class="font5">, “and we will not drink water from&nbsp;your wells.” Moses reassures the Edomites that the Israelites&nbsp;will not deprive them of water they had had to dig for, but&nbsp;would only drink from water which flowed in the streams&nbsp;coursing through their territory, water that would not be used&nbsp;by them anyways. These waters are not owned by anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דרך המלך נלך</span><span class="font5">, “we will march along the king’s highway.” We will march along a route indicated by the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תעבור בי</span><span class="font5">, “do not trespass on anything that I&nbsp;own; even though the Israelites offered to pay the King of&nbsp;Edom a head tax for every Israelite who would use the King’s&nbsp;highway, a huge income for him, the King refused adamantly.&nbsp;He was afraid that the Israelites would use the opportunity to&nbsp;invade and conquer his Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמרו אליו במסילה נעלה</span><span class="font5">, “they said to him: we will&nbsp;go up by the highway and we will pay for everything, etc.”&nbsp;they even offered to pay for water drunk from the rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר לא תעבור</span><span class="font5">, “the King said: “you must not&nbsp;cross (the boundary).” After confronting soldiers at the&nbsp;borders, the Israelites decided, in conformity with G’d’s&nbsp;command, not to violate Edom’s territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,22. כל העדה הר ההר</span><span class="font5">, “the entire congregation, to Hor </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hahar.”</span><span class="font5"> Even though the King of Edom had sent troops with&nbsp;an aggressive posture the Israelites did not incur a single&nbsp;casualty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,26. ואהרן יאסף</span><span class="font5">, “and Aaron will die (be gathered in to&nbsp;his forefathers). In verse 24 it stated this specifically. At that&nbsp;point we had not been told where Aaron would die. This&nbsp;information is being supplied in our verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">20,29. ויראו כל העדה</span><span class="font5">, “the entire congregation saw, etc.” since this verse cannot be understood literally, the Jerusalem&nbsp;Targum renders it as meaning that when the people&nbsp;witnessed Moses and Elazar returning without Aaron, they&nbsp;drew the appropriate conclusions, [especially, seeing that&nbsp;Elazar wore the garments of the High Priest, as described in&nbsp;verse 28. Ed.] They observed Moses having ash on his head&nbsp;and having rent his garments, calling out to Elazar, “woe for&nbsp;my brother Aaron!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: we find that the expression ראיה, “seeing” is also used to describe “knowing,” i.e. seeing&nbsp;with one’s mental eye. Prominent examples are: Genesis&nbsp;40,16, where the chief of the bakers is described as “seeing”&nbsp;that Joseph had properly explained the dream of the chief of&nbsp;the cup bearers. Another example of the root: ראה describing&nbsp;“understanding,” rather than seeing with one’s eyes, is found&nbsp;in Genesis 42,1 where our patriarch Yaakov is credited with&nbsp;seeing that there was grain for sale in far off Egypt, i.e. וירא&nbsp;יעקב כי יש שבר במצרים, “Yaakov “saw” that there was trading in&nbsp;grain going on in Egypt.” The author cites more examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,1. יושב הנגב</span><span class="font5">, “who resided in the southern part of the Land of Canaan;” in other words, Amalek; we have proof that&nbsp;Amalek resided in that part of the land from Numbers 13,29,&nbsp;from the report of the spies. If these people were indeed&nbsp;Amalek, why did the Torah not call these people by their real&nbsp;name but called them Canaanites? [Amalek is descended&nbsp;from Esau, i.e. is a Semitic tribe. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When G’d saw that Amalek attacked the Jewish people a second time, He said to Israel: “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> are not out of bounds&nbsp;to you as are the Edomites, although genetically they are as&nbsp;close to you or even closer than the Edomites, Amalek&nbsp;having been a grandson of Esau. You may, or even must&nbsp;destroy them, in due course. What applies to the Canaanites,&nbsp;i.e. that any of them who do not voluntarily leave their land&nbsp;you have to kill, men women and children, applies to them&nbsp;also. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> who says that the Israelites mistook&nbsp;these attackers for Canaanites as they had dressed as such.&nbsp;They had done so in order to cause the Israelites to pray to&nbsp;G’d to help them against the Canaanites, not against the&nbsp;Amalekites.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> apparently did not accept the opinion of&nbsp;Rabbi Eliezer hakalir, in his liturgical prayer recited on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Zachor,</span><span class="font5"> according to whom, on the contrary, the&nbsp;King of Arad (Canaanite) and his soldiers wore the uniforms&nbsp;of Amalekites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators on this paragraph -not named-understand our verse as having omitted a word, i.e. “and Amalek,” after the word “Arad,” in our verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have indeed found elsewhere that the tribe of Canaanites under the control of the IKing of Arad, lived in&nbsp;close proximity to the Amalekites. (Compare (Numbers&nbsp;14,25) Compare also verse 45 there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דרך האתרים</span><span class="font5">, the correct spelling ought to be התארים, the letters having been inverted similar to when we find כבשים&nbsp;spelled as כשבים, (sheep) or שמלה as שלמה (garment).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Compare Joshua 15,9: ותאר הגבול, “and the boundary curved, i.e. was inverted;” When the Amalekites heard that the&nbsp;Israelites had marched </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">around</span><span class="font5"> the territory of Edom from&nbsp;north to south, as stated in Numbers 21,4, they concluded&nbsp;that they would now attack from the southern region of&nbsp;Edom. They used this as an opportunity to attack them as&nbsp;they had displayed fear of the Edomites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרא שם המקום חרמה</span><span class="font5">, “Israel called the name of the&nbsp;place where this occurred: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chormah,</span><span class="font5"> “utter destruction.” It is&nbsp;not to be confused with a place by an identical name referred&nbsp;to in the Torah in Numbers 14,45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסעו מהר ההר</span><span class="font5">, “they journeyed on from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hor Hahar;”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the Torah now returns to the subject which had been&nbsp;interrupted when it described the detour around the territory&nbsp;of Edom. It had been interrupted by the report of the death of&nbsp;Aaron and the battle against Amalek as a result of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מהר ההר דרך ים סוף</span><span class="font5">, “from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hor Hahar,</span><span class="font5"> in the direction of the sea of Reeds, i.e. from north to south in order to detour&nbsp;around Edom. This was not a detour around Mount Seir, of&nbsp;which we are told in Deuteronomy 2,1. Here we are speaking&nbsp;of the twenty first year of the Israelites, immediately after the&nbsp;nineteen years the Israelites had remained in Kadesh Barnea&nbsp;the point from which the spies had been sent out. After that&nbsp;they detoured around the territory of Edom until they came to&nbsp;the Kadesh in the desert of Tzin. The detour around Edom&nbsp;occurred in the fortieth year after the Exodus, and was due to&nbsp;the King of Edom’s refusal to grant the Israelites the right to&nbsp;use his territory as transit toward the Jordan river. They also&nbsp;detoured around the southern part of the Kingdom of Moav,&nbsp;as the Torah had not given them the right to harass that&nbsp;country, as we read in Judges 11,17. When they arrived at a&nbsp;place called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ovot,</span><span class="font5"> (verse 10) which was located at the south&nbsp;eastern corner of the Kingdom of Moav, they turned north&nbsp;and turned left in the direction of the river Arnon, as we read&nbsp;in verse Deuteronomy 9-19. The number of way stations&nbsp;during that period, have not been enumerated, although each&nbsp;has been mentioned in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Massey,</span><span class="font5"> but some may have&nbsp;had more than one name. (Numbers 33,41-43).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותקצר נפש העם בדרך</span><span class="font5">, “and the people became impatient because of the length of the way.” The root קצר in the sense&nbsp;of impatient, occurs also in Exodus 6,9, when the people did&nbsp;not respond to Moses’ promises, i.e. ומקוצר רוח, “on account&nbsp;of an impatient spirit.” In this instance, the lengthy and&nbsp;strenuous detour around the boundaries of the Kingdom of&nbsp;Edom had tried their patience to breaking point. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explains why the meaning of the word could not possibly be&nbsp;the “shortness of the way,” as after 38 years plus they&nbsp;perceived themselves as getting further away from their&nbsp;destination rather than closer to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: The protective clouds shielding the people from the hot rays of the sun had ceased&nbsp;to function, as a result of Aaron’s death as these had been&nbsp;due to his merit, just as the water supply had been due to&nbsp;Miriam’s merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.5. כי אין לחם....ונפשנו קצה בלחם הקלוקל</span><span class="font5">, “for there was no bread (that was the product of the earth) and the&nbsp;insubstantial bread from heaven (the manna) the people had&nbsp;become fed up with.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression קצה is familiar to us from when Rivkah experiencing so much tension with her daughters-in-law, the&nbsp;wives of Esau, told her husband that if Yaakov were to marry&nbsp;wives from a similar background she would become fed up&nbsp;with living. (Genesis 27,46, .(קצתי בחיי</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בלחם</span><span class="font5">, “with the bread;” the letter ב at the beginning of this word has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach</span><span class="font5"> to show that a certain well&nbsp;known “bread” was meant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הקלוקל</span><span class="font5">, as in Ezekiel 21,26: קלקל בחצים, “like flashing arrows,” a simile for the word בדולח, “shining crystal,” a word&nbsp;used by the Torah to describe the appearance of the manna&nbsp;in Numbers 11,7. An alternate interpretation: the word is a&nbsp;variation of קלקול, as in Jeremiah 4,24: וכל הגבעות התקלקלו,&nbsp;“and all the heights, (low hills) are disintegrating.” They are&nbsp;not providing man with strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את הנחשים, </span><span class="font5">“the snakes.” According to Rabbi&nbsp;Yudan, the Torah, by not writing: נחשים, but הנחשים instead,&nbsp;claims that the cloud over the Jewish camp as long as Aaron&nbsp;had been alive, used to burn the snakes, and thus make&nbsp;them harmless, as far as the Jewish people were concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now that Aaron had died there was no remedy against being bitten by snakes. They became frequent sources of harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,7. את הנחש</span><span class="font5">, “the snake;” sometimes the word נחש&nbsp;appears in the singular, and sometimes in the plural mode.&nbsp;This is not unique, as we experienced it with the frogs in&nbsp;Exodus 8,2, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,9. נחש נחשת, “a copper snake.” </span><span class="font5">This metal was chosen, as, when polished, it shines and reflects light and&nbsp;therefore is highly visible. We know this from Ezekiel 1,7,&nbsp;where the prophet describes his vision of angels whose hooflike feet were described as sparkling like burnished copper.&nbsp;Even though the area of the Israelites camp was three miles&nbsp;square, anyone who had been bitten by a snake could see&nbsp;the copper snake that Moses had mounted on a pole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והביט אל נחש הנחשת</span><span class="font5">, “and when he looked at this replica of a copper coloured snake (he would live);” looking at this&nbsp;phenomenon automatically would make such a person think&nbsp;of heaven, and that his only hope for surviving the snakebite&nbsp;would come from heaven. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason that G’d chose this particular phenomenon was to remind the victim that the cure for his ailment had to&nbsp;be found in reversing the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">source</span><span class="font5"> of his affliction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Just as the original sin by the first woman was described as caused by a snake who had seduced the first&nbsp;woman, so this </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">source</span><span class="font5"> had to be discredited in the eyes of&nbsp;the afflicted person as symbolising that he had allowed&nbsp;himself to sin just as the first woman had been guilty of&nbsp;believing the snake, a mere creature, rather than the&nbsp;command of its Creator. Ed.] The miraculous powers of the&nbsp;Creator to heal, would best be demonstrated if it was shown&nbsp;that He could use the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">source</span><span class="font5"> of the affliction as the medicine&nbsp;that would cure it. [I have departed from the author’s use of&nbsp;the “chisel,” which to this Editor is rather meaningless,&nbsp;although it was taken from the commentary of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,10. ויסעו בני ישראל ויחנו באוות. </span><span class="font5">The Jewish people continued journeying and they encamped at Ovot. Their&nbsp;previous encampment had been at Punan as reported in&nbsp;Numbers 33,43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסעו מאובות</span><span class="font5">, “They journeyed on from Ovot;” from&nbsp;this point onwards they turned in a northerly direction. The&nbsp;text proves that this took place here, as the next&nbsp;encampment is described as being at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lyyey haavarim</span><span class="font5"> which&nbsp;is located facing the territory of Moav which was to the east.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחנו בעיי העברים</span><span class="font5">, “they made camp at a location known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">iyyey ha-avarim.</span><span class="font5"> According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this was a place&nbsp;from which it was easy to cross to the land of Canaan, and it&nbsp;was near Mount Nebo, the mountain containing Moses’&nbsp;unknown grave. Moses viewed the land of Israel from the&nbsp;summit of that Mountain. The author speculates that what is&nbsp;reported here took place before the conquest by the&nbsp;Israelites of the lands of Sichon and Og to the west of this&nbsp;location, reported later in this chapter. It appears as if Mount&nbsp;Nebo is not mentioned until after 3 further encampments as&nbsp;explained in the portion Massey, and as far as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explaining further that Mount Nebo intervened between Moav&nbsp;and the Emorites, perhaps prior to the war between Sichon&nbsp;and the first king of Moav this may have been so. But during&nbsp;that war, Sichon appropriated his whole land from him&nbsp;commencing from Mount Nebo as far as the river Arnon.&nbsp;(compare verse 26) The letter ע in בעיי, may have substituted&nbsp;for the letter א here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;משם נסעו</span><span class="font5">, “from there they continued their&nbsp;journeys;” The word “there,” refers to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">iyyey ha-avavrim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויחנו בנחל </span><span class="font5">זרד, “they encamped in the valley of the river Zered.” In Parshat Massey, however, we read that the&nbsp;Israelites first came to Divon gad, but there only land&nbsp;locations are mentioned, whereas here rivers are mentioned&nbsp;also. The reason may be that the Torah was interested here&nbsp;to report what occurred at Beer. The Israelites are reported&nbsp;as having If the Torah had written בעבר ארנון, “opposite the&nbsp;Arnon river,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויחנו מעבר ארנון</span><span class="font5">, “they encamped across from the&nbsp;river Arnon.” If the Torah had written instead: בעבר ארנון, this&nbsp;would have meant that they had had free choice where along&nbsp;the banks of the river Arnon to make camp. The letter מ in&nbsp;stead of the prefix ב, means that they had only been able to&nbsp;make camp on the part of the banks of that river which came&nbsp;from the boundary with the Emorites, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has&nbsp;explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מעבר ארנון</span><span class="font5">, where across from that river? The part in noman’s land, desert, where it had left the boundary of the territory belonging to the Emorites. Apparently, there was a&nbsp;small island in the middle of that river that afforded a&nbsp;relatively easy passage across the river, in a neutral area&nbsp;between the territory of the Emorites and that of Moav. This&nbsp;is what is referred to as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Almon divlatayma</span><span class="font5"> in Numbers 33,&nbsp;46. The river Arnon was the boundary between these two&nbsp;kingdoms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי ארנון גבול מואב בין מואב ובין האמורי</span><span class="font5">, “for Arnon was the boundary between the Emorites and the Moabites.” In earlier&nbsp;times, the territory of Moav had extended in a westerly&nbsp;direction to the river Jordan and in a northerly direction as far&nbsp;as Mount Nebo, which used to be the boundary with the&nbsp;Kingdom of Sichon. The latter had conquered a large slice of&nbsp;the original kingdom of Moav, (which due to that fact had no&nbsp;longer been included in the Moabite territory G’d had put out&nbsp;of bounds to the Israelites). This has been documented in&nbsp;verse 26 of our chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,14. על כן</span><span class="font5">, “this is why concerning the territories&nbsp;forbidden to the Israelites to conquer or harass, “it is stated in&nbsp;the book documenting the wars of the Lord, etc.” There are&nbsp;numerous books dating back to that period which have&nbsp;become lost in the course of the centuries in which more of&nbsp;the accomplishments of the Israelites in warfare had been&nbsp;preserved, including this war. Also numerous of the poems of&nbsp;King Solomon and his many parables have become lost&nbsp;throughout those centuries, though the people had been&nbsp;aware of their existence at one time. The composite title of&nbsp;these books was 'מלחמות ה, “wars conducted with the&nbsp;approval of the Lord.” We recall that Avigayil had said to&nbsp;David in Samuel I 25,28: כי מלחמות ה' אדוני נלחם, “my lord&nbsp;(David) has fought wars for the sake of the reputation of the&nbsp;Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">יאמר, “it is said;” the letter א in this word is vocalised with the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach,</span><span class="font5"> (not tzeyre).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את והב בסופה, </span><span class="font5">“vahav” is the name of a location at the extreme end of the territory of Moav, a place that the&nbsp;Israelites had crossed and where miracles had been&nbsp;performed for them similar to the ones at the sea of reeds.&nbsp;Compare a reference to this in what Balak told Bileam about&nbsp;the location at that time of the Israelites’ camp. (Numbers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">22,5.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואשד הנחלים</span><span class="font5">, this was another location that the&nbsp;Israelites were not allowed to invade as part of it was&nbsp;overhanging airspace belonging to the Moabite Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומשם</span><span class="font5">, “and from there,“ i.e. from the boundary of&nbsp;Moav; the warning against harassing that nation becomes&nbsp;effective extending as far as the place known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Be-er,&nbsp;which is identical with</span><span class="font5"> Kadesh, which is part of Edom, where&nbsp;G’d gave them the well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אז, “</span><span class="font5">then,” i.e. after G’d had provided them with&nbsp;the well from which to slake their thirst, they broke out in a&nbsp;song of thanksgiving. This song has not been recorded at the&nbsp;time it had been sung because at the same time this location&nbsp;had become the one at which both Moses and Aaron had&nbsp;been punished. When the time came to make a specific&nbsp;reference to that well, the Torah also reported this song that&nbsp;the Israelites had sung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation about the meaning of the line: 'בספר מלחמות ה, “in the Book recording the wars of the&nbsp;Lord:” This book was comparable to the Book of Chronicles&nbsp;kept by every nation in which a record has been made of all&nbsp;the wars between one nation and its neighbours, in which its&nbsp;victories have been recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression: את והב (verse 14) is to be understood as being a single word, just as the word אתיהב, where the&nbsp;letter ו has been exchanged for the letter א. We have a&nbsp;parallel for this in Genesis 45,1 where Joseph is described&nbsp;as misrepresenting himself with the word: בהתודע, a word&nbsp;from the root ידע. Another example of such an unusual&nbsp;construction is found in Genesis 27,29, where Yitzchok in his&nbsp;blessing to Yaakov is quoted as saying: הוה גביר לאחיך, “be&nbsp;senior over your brothers.” We would have expected the&nbsp;word: היה instead of הוה. It, i.e. the word והב is intended as an&nbsp;alternative to נתינה as in “gift,” as in Numbers 26,62, כי לא נתן&nbsp;להם נחלה, “for no ancestral piece of land had been given to to&nbsp;them.” The Targumim, translators into Aramaic, render the&nbsp;word נתן there as אתיהב. Here where we hear about the&nbsp;defeat of the King of Moav against Sichon of the Emorites,&nbsp;the words ואת והב בסופה, mean that that king at the end of that&nbsp;war had had to cede lands to the victor. This included the&nbsp;valley of the river Arnon. The well (through the rock) from&nbsp;which the Israelites were provided with water after Miriam’s&nbsp;death therefore was directly connected to what had once&nbsp;been Moav.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,18. חפרוה שרים</span><span class="font5">, ”which the princes had dug;” the&nbsp;“princes” mentioned in this poetic song are Moses and&nbsp;Aaron, who had hit the rock. It was they that had been&nbsp;commanded to speak to the rock. (20,8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במחוקק במשענותם</span><span class="font5">, “with the scepter and with their staffs.” By striking the rock they made a deep impression on it, and&nbsp;split it. The expression מחק occurs in this sense in Ezekiel&nbsp;8,10: מחוקה על הקיר, “depicted (engraved) over the whole&nbsp;wall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וממדבר מתנה</span><span class="font5">, “and from the desert to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Matanah.”</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">This still refers to the previous phrase, i.e. ויחנו בעבר ארנון אשר במדבר,&nbsp;“they encamped in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ever,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">which is situated in the desert.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ever</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">in the desert which is identical with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Almon divlataymah,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">they came to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Matanah,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">which is identical&nbsp;with place a called Mount </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ha</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">avarim</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">in the portion of Massey&nbsp;(Numbers 33,47). The reason why the place was called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Matanah,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">was that it was from here on in that the Israelites&nbsp;began to receive the gift of the land of Israel. The reason that&nbsp;the expression which we have so become used to, i.e. ויסעו&nbsp;ויחחנו, “they journeyed, they encamped,” is not used here, is&nbsp;that the people were still standing in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ever</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">of Arnon in the&nbsp;desert as reported in the Book of Deuteronomy 2,26: ואשלח&nbsp;מלאכים ממדבר קדמות אל סיחון (Moses speaking) “I sent out&nbsp;messengers to Sichon from the desert </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">k’deymot</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font5"> i.e. from the&nbsp;desert to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">east</span><span class="font5"> of his land, as opposed to: “from the desert&nbsp;to the south of his land.” In that chapter reference is made to&nbsp;the conquest of the lands of Sichon and Og.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וממתנה</span><span class="font5">, “and from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Matanah</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">;’”</span><span class="font5"> they came to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nachaliel</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> the word being a combination of river and valley.&nbsp;In Numbers 33,48, the Torah refers to this as the Israelites&nbsp;journeying from the chain of mountains known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">harey ha-avarim.”</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">From that point onwards, the Israelites made camp&nbsp;in the wilderness also known as שדה מואב, “the field or fields”&nbsp;of Moav. This was the last place where they made camp&nbsp;before crossing the Jordan river into the Holy Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומנחליאל</span><span class="font5">, “and from Nachaliel;” they spread out from there to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bamot,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">called בית הישימות in Numbers 33,49. The&nbsp;Emorites would refer to places where they worshipped their&nbsp;idols: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bamot,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">“elevated places,” whereas the Israelites called&nbsp;the same sites </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">beyt hayeshimites</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> “houses of desolation.”&nbsp;Our sages in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Avodah Zarah,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">folio 46, go&nbsp;into more detail about all this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומבמות, </span><span class="font5">and from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bamot</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;</span><span class="font5"> the Israelites spread out into the valley referred to in Numbers 33,39, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">avel hashittim.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">The word; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">avel</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">means: valley, steppe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר בשדה מואב ראש הפסגה</span><span class="font5">, “that is in the field of&nbsp;Moav, by the top of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pissgah;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">the word ומבמות which&nbsp;introduced this phrase means combined: “the elevation in the&nbsp;field of Moav which is beside the top of summit, which in turn&nbsp;looks down on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pney hayeshimon,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">is the great desert.”&nbsp;Seeing that at one time this tract of land had belonged to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Moav</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> it was still described by the Torah as such, as it had&nbsp;been known as such by the Israelites who were familiar with&nbsp;the region. This is also why the Torah still speaks about ערבות&nbsp;מואב, “the region formerly belonging to Moav, and still&nbsp;referred to by many as such.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different approach to these verses commencing with וממדבר מתנה. The well of which the Israelites spoke in their&nbsp;song had great significance seeing that in a desert, a place&nbsp;completely devoid of water, they had been provided with&nbsp;ample water completely free of charge, i.e. as a gift, .מתנה</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וממתנה נחליאל</span><span class="font5">, “and from the place called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Matanah</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">as far as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nachaliel”</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">there could not be found any other wells&nbsp;capable of supplying the water needed for the Israelite&nbsp;nation. Once they had received this gift of water from G’d,&nbsp;the river Arnon swelled way beyond its normal flow. (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">’</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chor&nbsp;shor</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The letter י in the word נחליאל, is superfluous, just as it is superfluous in Psalms 123,1 היושבי בשמים, and in Psalms</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">113,5, 113,6. The ending אל in the word expresses strength,&nbsp;as it does in Ezekiel 17,13: ואת אילי הארץ לקח</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“and the mighty&nbsp;of the land he took away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We also find this spelled out in Numbers 20,11 where the Torah stressed that a large amount of water came forth,&nbsp;i.e. far more than was needed. [there was no other reason to&nbsp;emphasize this just as it was not emphasized in Exodus 17,&nbsp;6, where Moses had struck a rock for that purpose a first&nbsp;time. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,21. וישלח ישראל מלאכים</span><span class="font5">, “Israel sent messengers;” in a different report in Deuteronomy 2,26 we are told that Moses&nbsp;sent messengers. Our sages conclude from this that two&nbsp;letters were sent to Sichon, one by Moses asserting Israel’s&nbsp;peaceful intentions when traversing his territory, the other by&nbsp;Israel, threatening war. (no source quoted). The second&nbsp;certainly sounds very peaceful. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לקראת ישראל המדברה </span><span class="font5">“in the direction of the&nbsp;Israelites, toward the desert.” We had been told that they had&nbsp;encamped in the desert at that time in verse 13 of our&nbsp;chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מארנון עד יבוק</span><span class="font5">, “from Arnon to the river </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yabok.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Both the land of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moav</span><span class="font5"> and the land of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Ammon</span><span class="font5"> are&nbsp;situated east of the land of Canaan (the west bank of the&nbsp;Jordan). The lands of Sichon were in between the land of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moav</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Ammon.</span><span class="font5"> Just as Sichon had taken land from&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moav</span><span class="font5"> from the southern region along the river Jordan as far&nbsp;north as the river Arnon, so he had taken land from the Bney&nbsp;Ammon from the north as far as the river </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yabok.</span><span class="font5"> As a result&nbsp;of this it had become permitted to the Israelites to take away&nbsp;these lands from Sichon, as they no longer were considered&nbsp;as either belonging to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moav</span><span class="font5"> or the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Ammon.</span><span class="font5"> In the&nbsp;words of our sages in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> folio 60,&nbsp;“Ammon and Moav had been cleansed by Sichon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי עז גבול בני עמון</span><span class="font5">, “for the border between the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Ammon</span><span class="font5"> was strong; but south of the river </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yabok</span><span class="font5"> Sichon had&nbsp;not been able to conquer, as that region was easier to&nbsp;defend, the river acting as a formidable obstacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.27. על כן יאמרו המושלים</span><span class="font5">, “this is why the people speaking in parables (Bileam and B’or according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi))&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">would say, etc.” B’or was the father of Bileam whom Sichon&nbsp;had hired to curse </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moav. (Tanchuma, Chukat,</span><span class="font5"> section 24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">באו חשבון, “come to Cheshbon to dwell there!” It will be built up now that it has come under the rule of Sichon. As&nbsp;long as it had been under the rule of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moav,</span><span class="font5"> people were&nbsp;afraid to settle there as the King of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moav</span><span class="font5"> did not offer much&nbsp;in the way of protection to his subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">תבנה ותכונן</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“let it be rebuilt and firmly established!” More so than previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עיר סימון</span><span class="font5">, “Sichon’s capital!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי אש יצאה מחשבון</span><span class="font5">, “for a fire has gone out from&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cheshbon.</span><span class="font5"> The inhabitants of Cheshbon rebelled against&nbsp;your king of Moav.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">להבה מקרית סימון</span><span class="font5">, “a flame from the city of Sichon;” i.e. the city that has now become Sichon’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעלי במות ארנון</span><span class="font5">, “the lords of the high places of Arnon.” Our author, quoting Samuel II 6,2, understands the word בעלי&nbsp;here as referring to a plain or plateau. In other words, the&nbsp;lands described here were all relatively high, though level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אוי לך מואב</span><span class="font5">, “woe unto you, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moav;”</span><span class="font5"> this is all part&nbsp;of the parables referred to earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אבדת עם כמוש</span><span class="font5">, “you are undone people who worship </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kemosh.”</span><span class="font5"> Do not be amazed at the word אבדת which usually&nbsp;means: “you are lost;” in this instance it means the same as&nbsp;in Micah 7,2 אבד חסיד מן הארץ, “the pious have vanished from&nbsp;the earth;” they have not literally disappeared, but have&nbsp;become passive as if they did not exist. The same applies to&nbsp;the Moabites now under the rule of Sichon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נתן בניו פליטים</span><span class="font5">, “he has made its sons fugitives;” a reference to the under age male children in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moav</span><span class="font5"> who&nbsp;though they escaped his sword have been turned into&nbsp;fugitives. They were allowed to grow up as prisoners in&nbsp;Sichon’s palace, as the Moabites saw no other way to keep&nbsp;them alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,30. ונירם אבד חשבון עד דיבון</span><span class="font5">, “in the meantime) we (the Israelites) came and threw over the rule of Sichon, not only&nbsp;Cheshbon has perished but even Divvon.” The word ניר,&nbsp;means: ”heir;” in the meantime no heir is left of the original&nbsp;Moabites (Compare Kings I 11,36, for the meaning of the&nbsp;word ניר.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation. The word ניר, is derived from ירה, “to shoot, to throw,” as in Exodus 15,4: ירה בים, “He&nbsp;tossed into the sea.” In other words, the Israelites are&nbsp;boasting that they had tossed the Emorites, etc., out of their&nbsp;land, or in ordinary Hebrew, ונשליכם. If you were to explain&nbsp;our verse according to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum,</span><span class="font5"> the letter ו at the&nbsp;beginning should have a short vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach,</span><span class="font5"> instead of the&nbsp;regular </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation: the word ניר is a variant of חרישה, “the act of ploughing,” as in Jeremiah 4,3: נירו לכם ניר,&nbsp;“break up the untilled ground!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונשים</span><span class="font5">, “we laid waste;” related to שממה, desolation.” The Israelites declare that they plowed over all the structures of&nbsp;the former inhabitants. [unlike what happened on the west&nbsp;bank of the Jordan when they captured all the Canaanite&nbsp;infrastructure 100% intact, and could make immediate use of&nbsp;it. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויירש את האמורי</span><span class="font5">, “and drove out the Emorite.” The&nbsp;word is read as if it had been spelled ויורש, “and inherited.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.33. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויפנו ויעלו</span><span class="font5">, “they turned around and ascended;” in&nbsp;a northerly direction. Seeing that anyone who walks from the&nbsp;south of the land of Israel northward must automatically be&nbsp;ascending, [as is due to the topography of the terrain, Ed.] he&nbsp;must ascend via Bashan, the land ruled by King Og. Seeing&nbsp;that the Kingdom of Og has been described as part of the&nbsp;land of Canaan, the commandment to kill anyone from that&nbsp;Kingdom who did not voluntarily leave, man woman or child;&nbsp;the Israelites did not send a letter offering to cross his land&nbsp;peacefully only in transit. (compare Deuteronomy 20,16) [The&nbsp;commandment not to allow survivors also applied to the&nbsp;Emorites, i.e. to Sichon and his country. Og, personally, a&nbsp;survivor of the deluge according to tradition, obviously could&nbsp;not have been a Canaanite, as they did not exist at that time.&nbsp;Ed.] Sichon, on the other hand, ruled over some lands that&nbsp;were not originally Canaanite, such as parts of Moav and&nbsp;Bney Ammon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצא</span><span class="font5">, “he (Og) came forth, provocatively, in a hostile manner.” Our author refers us to his having explained why&nbsp;Og lived as long as he lived, i.e. at least 850 years. (Genesis&nbsp;14,13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,34. אל תירא אותו</span><span class="font5">, “do not fear him!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that the reason why Moses was afraid of Og was that the&nbsp;merit of having alerted Avraham to Lot having been taken&nbsp;prisoner by the armies of Kedorleomer might have protected&nbsp;him. This seems highly unlikely, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> himself explains&nbsp;elsewhere that Og far from having noble intentions, wished&nbsp;Avraham dead, so that he could marry Sarah. We therefore&nbsp;must look for a different reason why Moses would have&nbsp;feared him. In the Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Horiot</span><span class="font5"> folio 10, we have a&nbsp;statement that a person should engage in Torah study even&nbsp;if his intentions are not wholly religiously motivated. As a&nbsp;proof the Talmud cites that the 42 sacrificial animals that&nbsp;Balak, who had hired Bileam to curse the Jewish people,&nbsp;offered to the Jewish G’d was rewarded by Ruth the Moabite,&nbsp;and ancestor of the Messiah through her great grandson&nbsp;David would be born and be married to Boaz. Moses was&nbsp;similarly concerned that if Og had survived thus far, G’d had&nbsp;had a mission in mind that he must fulfill and that mission&nbsp;had not yet been fulfilled by him. Only after G’d had set&nbsp;Moses’ mind at ease did he cease worrying about the&nbsp;outcome of the military encounter that was imminent. It was&nbsp;only after G’d reassured him that his mind was set to rest&nbsp;about the imminent military encounter involving also such a&nbsp;giant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,1. ויסעו בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “The Children of Israel resumed journeying;” after the victory of the men over Og and his&nbsp;army they brought their wives and children to encamp on the&nbsp;east bank of the Jordan river in the region between the rivers&nbsp;Arnon and Yabok.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Balak</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,2. וירא בלק</span><span class="font5">, “Balak saw,” (realised) Balak heard, as in Exodus 20,15: וכל העם רואים את הקולות, “and the whole&nbsp;nation </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">saw</span><span class="font5"> the thunder.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויגר מואב</span><span class="font5">, “Moav was afraid;” when the Moabites saw that the Israelites after having conquered the land of Sichon,&nbsp;part of which the latter had conquered from Moav, had not&nbsp;restored that part to them, the original owners, they&nbsp;suspected the Israelites of having designs on their land also.&nbsp;Moreover, they realised that seeing that the Israelites had&nbsp;overcome Sichon, who had previously overcome them, they&nbsp;would have no problem overcoming the remaining part of&nbsp;Moav. They did not realise that legally speaking, the lands&nbsp;formerly belonging to Moav had been acquired by the&nbsp;Israelites legally, as they had conquered it from a nation that&nbsp;had made war on them although not provoked. (Compare&nbsp;Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> folio 60)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מואב </span><span class="font5">^,”Moav was afraid (of the Israelites) but not the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Ammon, as Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has explained on Deuteronomy 2,9,&nbsp;where the Israelites were told by G’d not to harass the&nbsp;Moabites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר מואב אל זקני מדין</span><span class="font5">, “Moav said to the elders of&nbsp;Midian, etc.;” They were their neighbours and they were&nbsp;contractually allied to them. We know this from Genesis&nbsp;36,35: where Midian is referred to as having made common&nbsp;cause with Moav. Combined, they had defeated Haddad ben&nbsp;B’dad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עתה ילחכו</span><span class="font5">, “now they will lick up, etc.” after the Israelites had defeated Sichon and surrounding areas, they were afraid&nbsp;it would be their turn next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כלחון* השור</span><span class="font5">, “like the ox licks up, etc.;” the ox licks the grass with its tongue, which acts like a comb as it has no&nbsp;upper dentures, like all the beasts that are pure and allowed&nbsp;to be slaughtered by the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ארץ בני עמו</span><span class="font5">, “the land of his people,” the people of&nbsp;Bileam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אולי אוכל נכה בו</span><span class="font5">, “perhaps I can inflict a defeat on&nbsp;it;” the plural mode in the word נכה i.e. “we will inflict a&nbsp;defeat,” is not as surprising as it appears at first glance. We&nbsp;find a parallel in Song of Songs: 1,4: משכני אחריך נרוצה, “draw&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">me</span><span class="font5"> after you, let us run.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: “Let us inflict a defeat on it, you and me by engaging it in war; “I will wage war, and you&nbsp;will do the cursing.” The use of the word הכאה, “striking” in the&nbsp;sense of cursing is also not unique, as we find it in Jeremiah&nbsp;18,18: לכו ונכנו בלשון, “come and let us strike him with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">tongue</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואגרשנו מן הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “so that I may drive them out of the land.” Balak is referring to the land that Sichon had taken&nbsp;from Moav during the rule of Moav’s first king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וקסמים בידם</span><span class="font5">, “with tools of divination in their&nbsp;hands.” The “tools” were books of instruction on that subject,&nbsp;as explained by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span><span class="font5"> This is also how the Jerusalem&nbsp;Targum understands this phrase. We find a parallel of this&nbsp;when even in our time, sorcerers utter curses by sticking&nbsp;needles into dolls symbolising the party to be cursed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: Balak’s emissaries took financial rewards with them to pay Bileam for the use of&nbsp;these instruments used in sorcery. Compare Targum&nbsp;Yonatan on Nachum 3,17, according to Rabbi Chavell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וישבו שרי מואב עם בלעם</span><span class="font5">, “the emissaries of Moav&nbsp;stayed overnight with Bileam. They did so as they did not&nbsp;know anyone in Midian who would offer them hospitality. On&nbsp;the other hand, the dignitaries of Midian who had been&nbsp;accompanying them, had where to spend the night, as they&nbsp;were well known there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,12. לא תאור את העם</span><span class="font5">, ”do not curse the people.” G’d was well aware of the plague that would strike many&nbsp;Israelites who would worship </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baal Peor,</span><span class="font5"> as a result of&nbsp;Bileam’s advice to seduce the Israelites by becoming&nbsp;sexually licentious. G’d did not want </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">that</span><span class="font5"> plague to be&nbsp;attributed to Bileam’s curse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר אל שרי בלק</span><span class="font5">, “he said to the emissaries of&nbsp;Balak;” the emissaries of Midian are no longer mentioned as&nbsp;Balak was the star player in this story, the Midianites had no&nbsp;personal stake in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר אל שרי בלק</span><span class="font5">, “he said to Balak’s emissaries,&nbsp;etc.” the emissaries of Midian are no longer mentioned as&nbsp;they were only of secondary interest their land not bordering&nbsp;on the land of Canaan and not under threat by the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,15. שרים רבים</span><span class="font5">, “more and higher ranking emissaries.”&nbsp;We have a parallel for this in Esther 1,8 where the word רב in&nbsp;the singular is used in the same sense, i.e. על כל רב ביתו,&nbsp;“over the highest ranking officials of his household.”&nbsp;Compare also Jeremiah 39,13: וכל רבי מלך בבל, ”and all the&nbsp;commanders of the King of Babylonia.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואדעה מה יוסף ה' דבר עמי</span><span class="font5">, “and I will know what G’d&nbsp;will say to me in addition.” Even though G’d had told him&nbsp;already: “do not go with them!” Bileam was so anxious to find&nbsp;a way to go and curse the Israelites that he was convinced&nbsp;that his curse would be effective. He said to himself: “if G’d&nbsp;considered my curses as ineffective, why did He bother to try&nbsp;and stop me?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.20. אם לקרא לך</span><span class="font5">, “if these men simply extended an invitation to you to visit Balak, etc.” G’d referred to a social&nbsp;visit, involving food and drink. If you were to ask what&nbsp;happened in the interval so that G’d appeared to give Bileam&nbsp;an opening now that He did not know about previously,&nbsp;whereas previously He had spoken to him in absolute terms:&nbsp;“do not go with them!?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must interpret G’d’s previous instruction as having meant only: “do not go with them </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to curse the people</span><span class="font5">,” but&nbsp;not as an absolute refusal to let Bileam make the journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: there was no change in G’d’s attitude at all; this time G’d related to a new delegation of&nbsp;officials, and whatever G’d permitted now was not relevant to&nbsp;what He had forbidden to an invitation issued by lower&nbsp;ranking emissaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third possible interpretation: “if these people are so foolish as to believe that I will change My basic attitude which</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I already expressed to Bileam the first time, go ahead and travel with them, and you will see soon how useless this&nbsp;journey will be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,21. וילך עם שרי מואב</span><span class="font5">, “he went with the emissaries from Moav.” He did not literally go with them, i.e. keep pace&nbsp;with them, but he followed them. Had the Torah written: וילך&nbsp;אתם, this would have meant that he literally accompanied&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,22. ויחר אף ה' כי הולך הוא</span><span class="font5">, “The Lord was angry that he was going;” G’d’ had not given a “green light,” although&nbsp;Bileam made believe that he had obtained full approval. He&nbsp;should have understood from the first nocturnal conversation&nbsp;with G’d that it was not His intention for him to be going. We&nbsp;find something similar in the story of the spies that Moses&nbsp;sent out to evaluate the land of Canaan. G’d had said: שלח לך&nbsp;אנשים, “send out for your own peace of mind men, etc,&nbsp;(Numbers 13,2)” It had been quite clear to Moses that when&nbsp;G’d had agreed to the people’s demand to send spies, that&nbsp;G’d had entertained reservations from the start about the&nbsp;success of such a mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the line: “G’d was a angry, etc.” He had told Bileam that he was not able to say what he&nbsp;wished but could say only the words G’d would put in his&nbsp;mouth. Surely this was a clear warning to Bileam to desist,&nbsp;as he was going to make a fool or worse of himself if after&nbsp;having come all the way from Midian to Moav he could not&nbsp;deliver what was expected of him. At least he should have&nbsp;asked G’d what precisely he was allowed to say once he&nbsp;faced Balak in person. He was too hasty due to his hatred of&nbsp;the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The paragraph about Balak and Bileam, which did not directly impact on the Israelites, was written to teach us why&nbsp;G’d deprived the nations of the world of any share in holy&nbsp;spirit, as it demonstrates the effect of granting holy spirit to&nbsp;the wrong kind of people, who would use it to try and&nbsp;manipulate G’d for their desires instead of to help them to&nbsp;serve Him better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושני נעריו עמו </span><span class="font5">“accompanied by his two loyal servants.” He took only two. G’d arranged it so in order that the strange</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">behaviour of Bileam’s ass could not be attributed to the ass having become confused in the presence of so many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וחרבו שלופה בידו, “</span><span class="font5">with his sword drawn in his&nbsp;sword.” This is a case of the punishment fitting the crime, i.e.&nbsp;Bileam had said that he would kill his ass for its rebellious&nbsp;behaviour; (verse 29) now the angel makes Bileam realise&nbsp;that the one who deserved to be killed for rebelling against&nbsp;G’d was not the ass but Bileam himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גדר מזה וגדר מזה</span><span class="font5">, “with a fence being on either&nbsp;side.” There are some commentators who claim that this&nbsp;“fence” was the same as the stone piles erected by Yaakov&nbsp;and Lavan, at the time they parted company; the same&nbsp;commentators also identify Bileam as being the reincarnation&nbsp;of Lavan, as he displayed the same attitude towards the&nbsp;Jewish people as had Lavan towards the first Jewish family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They go further and identify Bileam as Kushan Rishatayim, Judges 3,8 (compare Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 105), where they describe all three characters as&nbsp;basically the same, each a reincarnation of the former. At this&nbsp;point Bileam/Lavan is perceived as having violated the pact&nbsp;concluded at that stone pile between Yaakov and Lavan&nbsp;(Genesis 31, 44-54) It was logical therefore that this stone&nbsp;pile would now threaten Bileam for violating the oath sworn&nbsp;by Lavan to Yaakov at the time. The קיר, wall, mentioned in&nbsp;our story is a clear reference to the stones erected by both&nbsp;Lavan and Yaakov at that time. If Bileam is described a little&nbsp;while later as being lame, this is attributed to the ass having&nbsp;pressed him against that wall as punishment for his violating&nbsp;the original oath of peace between Yaakov and Lavan.&nbsp;(Compare 23,3, וילך שפי, “he walked with a limp.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,26. ויוסף מלאך ה עבור</span><span class="font5">, “and the angel of the Lord went further;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> he hinted to him that a people&nbsp;founded on the merits of three patriarchs such as Avraham,&nbsp;Yitzchok, and Yaakov, would hardly be intimidated by the&nbsp;curses of the likes of a money-oriented Bileam. In Lavan’s&nbsp;time Yaakov had not yet been able to draw on the merits of&nbsp;three patriarchs as could the Israelites in the meantime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Bileam thought that the fact that Yishmael and the sons of Keturah, all of whom Avraham expelled, were a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">sign of spiritual weakness in that house, the merit acquired by Yitzchok at the binding of him at Mount Moriah, offset any&nbsp;such notion. When Bileam thought that the fact that Yitzchok&nbsp;had also sired Esau showed spiritual weakness in the family&nbsp;of that patriarch, the fact that all of Yaakov’s children had&nbsp;remained true to the Abrahamitic tradition blocked his&nbsp;attempts in that direction to harm the Israelites by cursing&nbsp;them. This is the implied meaning of the words: אשר אין דרך&nbsp;לנטות ימין ושמאל, “where there was no way to turn either to the&nbsp;right or to the left.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותרבץ תחת בלעם ויחר אף בלעם</span><span class="font5">, “when she lay down&nbsp;beneath Bileam, Bileam became very angry.” His anger was&nbsp;prompted by the fact that his ass had chosen to deny him her&nbsp;services at the very moment when her master had been&nbsp;injured and was in need of her more than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויך את האתון במקל</span><span class="font5">, “he struck the ass; the first time with the palm of his hand, the second time with a kind of riding&nbsp;whip, and the third time with his walking staff, as one does to&nbsp;obstinate domestic beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מה עשיתי לך </span><span class="font5">, “what have I done to you?” [It did&nbsp;not dawn on the ass that her master had not seen the angel&nbsp;barring the path. Ed.] The letter ל in the word לך, has a semivowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sheva.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,30. אשר רכבת עלי, </span><span class="font5">“the one upon which you have ridden.” There are several interruptions in the cantillation&nbsp;signs in this verse, indicating that the ass did not immediately&nbsp;add the words: “all your life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מעודך עד היום הזה</span><span class="font5">, “from the time you have learned how to ride.” These words complement the ass’ question if it had&nbsp;ever been in the habit of acting so strangely. You should&nbsp;have asked yourself what could possibly be the reason for&nbsp;my having acted so strangely and out of character. Surely I&nbsp;must have had a valid reason for acting as I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,32. כי ירט הדרך לנגדי</span><span class="font5">, “because your way is contrary to me.” The word כי is used here in the sense of “although,” just&nbsp;as in Genesis 48,14: “כי נמשה הבכור, “although Menashe is the&nbsp;firstborn.” The same meaning for the word כי is true in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Psalms 41,5: כי חטאתי לך, which correctly translated means: “although I have sinned against You.” It would not make&nbsp;sense to translate this as “</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">I have sinned against you,”&nbsp;although most translated editions of Psalms translate it this&nbsp;way. One does not ask for mercy </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">because</span><span class="font5"> one has sinned,&nbsp;but in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">spite</span><span class="font5"> of having sinned. The angel explains to Bileam&nbsp;that although the latter had undertaken a mission against&nbsp;G’d’s will, G’d gives him this opportunity to desist from his&nbsp;evil intent and the resulting punishment. [This is also why the&nbsp;angel is associated with G’d’s attribute of Mercy, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">instead of with His attribute of Justice, i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elokim.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,33.ותראני האתון ותט לפני</span><span class="font5">, “and the ass saw me and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">turned aside.” It was facing me all the time but attempted to detour either to the right or to the left so as to pass me. If it&nbsp;had turned backwards on account of your having struck it, I&nbsp;would have killed you as you had abused it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מפני</span><span class="font5">, “only on my account;” only on account of her having seen me. She was totally innocent, as her behaviour&nbsp;was due to my not having given her any other choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואותה החייתי</span><span class="font5">, “but I would have let her live,” as she acted under duress, as opposed to you. There is a difference&nbsp;between the words: לפני, and מפני. as in Deuteronomy 7,22:&nbsp;The latter means “out of your sight; ונשל הגוים האלה </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">מפניך</span><span class="font5">, “He&nbsp;will fling out these nations before you (so that you will no&nbsp;longer see them;)” or Deuteronomy 9,4: “He will dispossess&nbsp;them so that you will no longer see them.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גם אותך הרגתי </span><span class="font5">“but I would have killed you also;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> this is a truncated phrase, and we have&nbsp;to translate it as if the word גם had been written </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;word הרגתי so that the meaning is: “not only would I have&nbsp;impeded the ass’ progress, but I would even have also killed&nbsp;you in order to prevent your progress any further.” Now that&nbsp;the phrase has been truncated, taking into consideration that&nbsp;your own ass has already remonstrated with you, I have only&nbsp;“killed” the ass but have let you live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: If I had interpreted this verse strictly in accordance with how it appears here, I would&nbsp;have placed you on the same level as your ass, and the&nbsp;meaning of the phrase would have been: “I also would have&nbsp;killed your two loyal servants.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,34. חטאתי כי לא ידעתי</span><span class="font5">, “I have sinned for I did not know;” the word כי here is to be understood in the sense of&nbsp;אשר, “in that,” i.e. Bileam explains that he had not known&nbsp;previously why his journey would not be successful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,41. ויעלהו במות בעל</span><span class="font5">, “he brought him up to the heights of Baal;” the word בעל as a description of a plain, also occurs&nbsp;in Numbers 21,28: when it describes a similar plain in the&nbsp;region of the river Arnon. Our author draws the reader’s&nbsp;attention to what he had written on that verse. It also occurs&nbsp;in this sense in Joshua 11,17 בעל גד.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בנה לי בזה שבעה מזבחות</span><span class="font5">, “build seven altars for me&nbsp;in this location!” Bileam wanted to equal the numbers of&nbsp;altars which righteous people had built in honour of G’d up&nbsp;until now. They were Adam, Hevel, Noach, Avraham,&nbsp;Yitzchok , Yaakov, and Moses. By sacrificing offerings to the&nbsp;Jewish G’d on each of these altars he hoped to stave off the&nbsp;destruction decreed by G’d on the seven Canaanite nations.&nbsp;This is also why he composed seven separate poems&nbsp;extolling G’d. (Compare 23,7, 18-24.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעה פרים ושבעה אלים</span><span class="font5">, “seven bullocks and seven rams.” Matching the number seven was a common custom amongst&nbsp;people in those days, and even the Torah, on occasion, also&nbsp;reflects this custom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;פר ואיל במזבח</span><span class="font5">, “a bullock and a ram to be offered&nbsp;on each of these altars.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וילך שפי</span><span class="font5">, “he was limping,” as a result of the ass&nbsp;having squeezed his leg against the wall. He was so&nbsp;consumed with hatred for the Jewish people that he did not&nbsp;even take time out to wait until his injury had healed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שפי</span><span class="font5">, the expression in this sense occurs in Job 33,21: עצמותיו ^V’and his bones were rubbed away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקר אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “and G’d met;” the letter ק has the&nbsp;vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach</span><span class="font5"> under it, to make sure we would understand&nbsp;that this “meeting” of G’d with Bileam would be understood&nbsp;as if per chance, מקרה. Bileam was not able to prearrange a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">date</span><span class="font5"> with G’d. Other examples of the use of this word in a&nbsp;similarly adjusted construction, are found in וירא, instead of&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויראה</span><span class="font5">, from the root ראה “to see.” Here we would have&nbsp;expected ויקרה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,5. וכה תדבר, </span><span class="font5">“and thus you shall say</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">there was no need to spell out the precise wording Bileam was to use at&nbsp;this stage, as long as he would know what would follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,7. מהררי קד</span><span class="font5">ם, “from the mountains of the East.” This&nbsp;was a repetition as we know that Aram is in the East, (Isaiah&nbsp;9,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.8. 'מה אקוב וגו</span><span class="font5">, “how can </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">\_</span><span class="font5"> curse where G’d has not cursed;” seeing that Bileam stood on the top of high rocks, as&nbsp;we have read in 22,41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומגבעות אשורנו</span><span class="font5">, “and from the hills I see it.” They&nbsp;encamp by themselves and are totally self sufficient. No&nbsp;other nation can hope to attack them successfully as their&nbsp;Creator has assured them of His ensuring their security. This&nbsp;was the promise we read in Leviticus 25,19, and 26,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,10 מי מנה עפר יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “Who has counted the dust of Yaakov?” Who can even count the small dust particles of&nbsp;Yaakov, the young children. They have small children en&nbsp;masse that are never part of any census. The only Israelites&nbsp;that have ever been subject to a census are the able-bodied&nbsp;men between the ages of 20-60. In other words, the number&nbsp;of Israelites who have never been couned by far outnumber&nbsp;those that have been counted. Even if we were to assume&nbsp;that some of the adults had been guilty of some sins, the vast&nbsp;majority of them, the children, certainly have not been guilty&nbsp;of any sins. Therefore I am unable to make any curses&nbsp;effective against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומספר את רובע ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “nor who has numbered even one quarter of Israel?” Balak himself had told Bileam that only a&nbsp;small section of it was visible from their vantage point. (verse&nbsp;13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תמות נפשי מות ישרים</span><span class="font5">, “let me die the death of the righteous!” He had foreseen in the stars that he was destined&nbsp;to die by the sword.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,13. לך נא אתי אל מקום אחר</span><span class="font5">, “please go with me to another location.” The letter ך here is as if it had been&nbsp;repeated, even though the root is still הליכה, “walking.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,15. ואנכי אקרה כה</span><span class="font5">, “and I will go toward a meeting yonder.” The letter א in אקרה has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא איש אל ויכזב</span><span class="font5">, “G’d is not man who is apt to&nbsp;deceive;” Bileam tells Balak that G’d will not revoke a&nbsp;blessing once He had bestowed it, seeing that the blessings&nbsp;Bileam had bestowed on the Jewish people in His name had&nbsp;been bestowed on a people free from sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובן אדם ויתנחם</span><span class="font5">, “nor is He a human being liable to repent what He had said.” There are three different kinds of&nbsp;“repents.” 1) One does not keep one’s word.” 2) One cannot&nbsp;keep it for reasons beyond one’s control. 3) One fails to keep&nbsp;a promise because the intended recipient had committed a&nbsp;sin against the party who made the promise. Concerning the&nbsp;latter two, Bileam says: “nor a human being who repents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וברך ולא אשיבנה</span><span class="font5">, “and when He has blessed, I am&nbsp;unable to reverse this.” The reason is explained in the verse&nbsp;following, i.e. that he had not seen any iniquity amongst the&nbsp;Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותרועת מלך בו</span><span class="font5">, “and their King’s acclaim is in their&nbsp;midst.” A reference to the camp of Israel; Bileam refers to&nbsp;what we have read in Numbers 10,9 about the efficacy of the&nbsp;trumpets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כתועפות, </span><span class="font5">like the lofty horns;” the construction of&nbsp;this word implies that there is more than one of these horns.&nbsp;Our author cites Zecharyah 5,2 as a parallel, מגלה עפה, “a&nbsp;flying scroll.” The horns of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Re-em,</span><span class="font5"> are twice as strong as&nbsp;ordinary horns. Although there is no known animal nowadays&nbsp;that is called Re-em, the Torah uses the mythical animal as&nbsp;an example of this creature possessing strong horns. People&nbsp;in Moses’ time were still familiar with that species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי לא נחש ביעקב</span><span class="font5">, “for there is none in Yaakov who&nbsp;relies on enchantments.” Compare use of that term in&nbsp;Genesis 30,27, where Lavan credits his financial success&nbsp;during Yaakov’s stay with him to such enchantments. We&nbsp;find it again when Joseph’s servant upon searching for the&nbsp;missing goblet credits his master with using it as such an&nbsp;instrument (Genesis 44,15). Here it is used by Bileam to tell&nbsp;Balak about the futility of engaging in such enchantments&nbsp;when dealing with the Jewish people. No sorcery will&nbsp;succeed in bringing a curse on Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כעת יאמר ליעקב</span><span class="font5">, “now it will be said of Yaakov;” Bileam refers to the year following after the Israelites have crossed&nbsp;the river Jordan. At that time many of the miracles that G’d&nbsp;has performed on behalf of the Jewish nation will be recited&nbsp;in public. The expression is similar to: '</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מה רבו מעשיך ה</span><span class="font5">, “how&nbsp;great and manifold are Your works o Lord.” (Psalms 104,24)&nbsp;We know the expression </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כעת</span><span class="font5">, as referring to the same time in&nbsp;the following year when the angel announces to Avraham&nbsp;that his wife will have son at the same time a year hence.&nbsp;(Genesis18,14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ליעקב ולישראל</span><span class="font5">, concerning Yaakov and Israel;” but not concerning Avraham and Yitzchok, as only Yaakov/Israel&nbsp;had managed to raise all his children in the Avrahamitic&nbsp;tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ודם חללים ישתה</span><span class="font5">, “and he shall drink the blood of&nbsp;the slain.” This refers to the statement about the lion drinking&nbsp;the blood of the prey he has slain. He eats the flesh and&nbsp;drinks the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גם ברך לא תברכנו</span><span class="font5">, “at least do not bless it!” Bileam&nbsp;was concerned that Bileam’s blessings for the Jewish people&nbsp;were referring to the immediate future. He had no idea that&nbsp;Bileam spoke of what would occur in the distant future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,1. ולא הלך כפעם בפעם, “</span><span class="font5">and he did not go as</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">previously time after time;” seeing that there was no point in continuing to manipulate the G’d of the Israelites, Bileam&nbsp;knew that he had G’d’s approval as the Torah wrote in&nbsp;Numbers verse 2 that the spirit of the Lord had settled upon&nbsp;him. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וישת אל המדבר פניו</span><span class="font5">, “and he raised his eyes in the direction of the desert.” This was the region where the fields&nbsp;of Moav were located, the area where the Israelites were&nbsp;located at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר מחזה שדי יחזה</span><span class="font5">, “who sees the vision of the&nbsp;Almighty;” an expression announcing that what follows is of&nbsp;prophetic dimension. It is similar to Numbers 23,3 where&nbsp;Bileam looked forward to being shown parts of the future so&nbsp;that he could reveal it at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מה טובו אוהליך יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “how goodly are your tents o&nbsp;Yaakov.” The reason that Bileam complimented the Jewish&nbsp;people in these terms is that Yaakov had been described by&nbsp;the Torah as: איש תם יושב אהלים, “a quiet man, a dweller in&nbsp;tents.” (Genesis 25,27)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יזל מים מדליו</span><span class="font5">, “water shall flow from his branches.”&nbsp;This is not the only time when the Bible uses the singular&nbsp;mode when speaking of מים, water, which is mostly used in&nbsp;the plural mode. A relatively well known example of “water”&nbsp;being used in the singular mode is found in Numbers 19,20&nbsp;מי נדה לא זורק עליו, “the water used to cleanse menstruants&nbsp;has not been sprinkled upon him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מדליו</span><span class="font5">, “ from its branches.” We find this word in this sense also in Jeremiah 11,16: ורעו דליתיו, “it breaks its&nbsp;branches.” The meaning there seems to be that the water&nbsp;dripping from the branches drips to its roots (harming them).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וזרעו במים רבים</span><span class="font5">, “and his seed shall be in many waters.” This is why it never has to worry about failing to produce fruit.&nbsp;This is the parable, followed by the declaration that David’s&nbsp;kingdom will outrank that of Agag, King of the Amalekites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וחציו ימחץ</span><span class="font5">, “piercing them with his arrows.” He&nbsp;(Israel) will use its arrows to pierce its opponents. There are&nbsp;numerous words in the Torah where the letter ב that we&nbsp;would have expected has been omitted. The word וחציו&nbsp;instead of ובחציו, is one of such examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,9. מברכיך ברוך ואורריך ארור</span><span class="font5">, “those who bless you will be blessed and those who curse you will be cursed.” Bileam&nbsp;ridicules people who wish to curse the Jewish people, as in&nbsp;so doing they only bring a curse upon themselves. The Torah&nbsp;had made this point already in Genesis 12,3, when G’d said&nbsp;so to Avraham when he set out to migrate to the land of&nbsp;Canaan. In addition, Yitzchok had passed on this blessing to&nbsp;his son Yaakov, when he said to him in Genesis 27,29:&nbsp;“those who curse you will themselves be cursed, whereas&nbsp;those who bless you will be blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,11. ועתה ברח לך אל מקומך</span><span class="font5">, “and now flee to your place!” Balak urges Bileam to disappear with all possible&nbsp;speed before he will express his anger in stronger terms. The&nbsp;expression: ברח, “flee!” is used in this context in Song of&nbsp;Songs 8,14, ברח דודי, “flee my beloved;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the words “ועתה ברח לך,” are not so much a dismissal of Bileam, as a reversal of what&nbsp;Bileam had been saying to him repeatedly when exploring if&nbsp;there was a place from which cursing the Israelites might be&nbsp;effective. He would no longer accompany Bileam to any&nbsp;place suggested, as he knew that he would not curse the&nbsp;Jewish people when he would come to such a place. The&nbsp;best thing for Bileam to do therefore would be to return home&nbsp;at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,14. לכה איעצך</span><span class="font5">, “come and I will advise you, etc.”&nbsp;Moses does not spell out precisely what advice Bileam gave&nbsp;Balak at that point seeing that it was something Bileam had&nbsp;not done publicly. However, when the Torah describes the&nbsp;portion dealing with the Midianites, it becomes clear to the&nbsp;reader what Bileam must have suggested to Balak, i.e. to&nbsp;find a way to seduce the Israelites into promiscuous conduct&nbsp;with the females of Moav and Midian and thus pull down their&nbsp;G’d’s wrath on themselves. (Compare what Moses said in&nbsp;Numbers 31,15 to the soldiers bringing female Midianite&nbsp;prisoners of war home with them)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר יעשה העם הזה לעמך, </span><span class="font5">“what this nation will do to your nation.” Seeing that this prophecy concerned events far in&nbsp;the future, Bileam consoled Balak that he had nothing to fear&nbsp;from the Israelites in the immediate future. The details will be&nbsp;spelled out shortly, Bileam again emphasizing that he does&nbsp;not speak about the immediate future. (verse 17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויודע דעת עליון</span><span class="font5">, “and who knows the knowledge of&nbsp;the Most High;” he knows that it is not “G’d’s intention to&nbsp;have the Israelites cursed as long as they are not guilty of&nbsp;trespasses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מחזה שדי יחזה</span><span class="font5">, “and who sees the Vision of the Almighty.” He sees Him both when he is reposing and when&nbsp;he is fully awake with both eyes. In other words, Bileam&nbsp;boasts of having prophetic insights both at night and by day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אראנו ולא עתה</span><span class="font5">, “I see him but not now;” this is a&nbsp;reference to King David, who would not rule over Israel for&nbsp;another 400 years. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשורנו ולא קרוב</span><span class="font5">, “I behold him but not in the near future;” this is part of a poetic formula, the poet repeating himself&nbsp;with different words meaning the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דרך כוכב מיעקב</span><span class="font5">, “a star shall step forth emanating from Yaakov;” the word is used describing walking, just as&nbsp;Deuteronomy 1,36: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר דרך בה</span><span class="font5">, “who walked on it.” Bileam&nbsp;describes the Israelites as having reached a level that&nbsp;includes walking among the stars, whom they enlisted in their&nbsp;support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וקם</span><span class="font5">, “and there will arise, etc.;” both scepter and royalty,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומחץ פאתי מואב</span><span class="font5">, “and shall smite even the corners of Moav.” Bileam prophesies that in the future Israel will also&nbsp;capture the territories of Edom, Moav and Ammon. A&nbsp;practical example of this is found in Judges 5,20 during the&nbsp;war between the armies of Barak and Sisera, the Field&nbsp;Marshal of Ammon. During that period even the stars were&nbsp;perceived by the Canaanites and Ammonites as engaging in&nbsp;war against them on behalf of Israel (song of victory by the&nbsp;prophetess Deborah) G’d, in His initial promise to Avraham&nbsp;had included these lands in the ones promised to Avraham’’s&nbsp;descendants. (Genesis chapter 15,19-21).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וקרקר כל בני שת</span><span class="font5">, “and break down all the sons of Sheth.” Some commentators understand this prophecy as referring&nbsp;to the Moabites as the latter were the descendants of an&nbsp;incestuous relationship between the daughters of Lot with</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">their father. (Genesis Compare Isaiah 20,5, for use of the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שת </span><span class="font5">in this sense.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירד מיעקב</span><span class="font5">, “and out of Yaakov one shall have&nbsp;dominion.” A dictator will arise from Yaakov and destroy the&nbsp;last vestige of the Edomites. Bileam refers to David’s general&nbsp;Yoav, of whom it has been reported in Kings I 11,16: “for&nbsp;Yoav and all Israel stayed there for six months until they had&nbsp;killed off every male member of the Edomites.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וירד מיעקב</span><span class="font5">, “of this man it is said: “he will not leave a remnant of the house of Esau.” (Ovadiah, 18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירא את עמלק</span><span class="font5">, “He saw (with his mental eye)&nbsp;Amalek, i.e. the descendants of Amalek; seeing that this was&nbsp;the first nation to engage the recently liberated Israelites in&nbsp;battle, Bileam details its eventual demise as separate from all&nbsp;the other nations who will share a similar fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירא את הקיני</span><span class="font5">, “He envisioned the Kenite;” Here&nbsp;the reference is to the people known as Ammon, the Kenite&nbsp;mentioned in Genesis chapter 15 not the descendants of&nbsp;Yitro. This tribe is mentioned there as a part of a group&nbsp;comprising the Kenite, K’nisite, and the Kadmoni. (Genesis&nbsp;15,19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bileam had already prophesied about Moav, and Edom of the future; now he adds a prophecy about the future of the&nbsp;Ammonites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איתן מושביך</span><span class="font5">, “you considered your dwelling place as secure. You boasted that when G’d had told the Israelites no&nbsp;to harass them that they were invincible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושים</span><span class="font5">, “and for additional safety you positioned your home on top of a rock.” The word ושים should really have&nbsp;been ושימת, “you have positioned,” in the past tense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.22. כי אם יהיה לבער קין</span><span class="font5">, “nonetheless Kayin shall be wasted;” his descendants will be wiped off the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד מה אשור תשבך</span><span class="font5">, “How long? Until Ashur shall carry you away captive;” He will not give you rest unless you will make&nbsp;common cause with him until you will burn up. The&nbsp;expression כי אם, occurs frequently as meaning: אלא, but.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">קין, this word here is a reference to the name of a place. This is why Ammon here is identified with the place&nbsp;known as Kenite. (According to most interpretations the&nbsp;descendants of Yitro, if they distance themselves from&nbsp;Amalek, will not share in Amalek’s destruction, but will&nbsp;survive together with Israel)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">24,25.ויקם בלעם, “Bileam arose;” he had been lying down while his eyes had been wide awake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">וישב למקומו, he returned to his place, i.e. to Aram Naharayim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">25.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נגד השמש, “facing the sun;” concerning this&nbsp;apparently irrelevant detail, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> quotes a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> which&nbsp;states that it is the sun that reveals who are the sinners. The&nbsp;cloud retreats from the sinner exposing him as such. The&nbsp;“cloud” referred to is the protective cloud that enveloped the&nbsp;Jewish people for almost forty years until the death of Aaron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">25.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הרגו איש את אנשיו, “slay every man each of the&nbsp;men (that have worshipped the Baal Pe-or) the bodies to be&nbsp;hanged.!” The leader of each tribe was charged with that&nbsp;task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">25.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקרב אל אחיו את המדינית, “and he publicly&nbsp;presented to his brethren the Midianite woman;” the root קרב&nbsp;has been chosen by the chosen by the Torah to describe&nbsp;carnal relations, for instance in Genesis 20,4. Compare also&nbsp;Isaiah 8,3 ואקרב אל הנביאה, “I was intimate with the&nbsp;prophetess.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">והמה בוכים, “while these were weeping;” they wept when they heard Moses’ instructions to kill the guilty persons. In&nbsp;many instances it meant that they had to kill their own&nbsp;relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">25.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירא פינחס, “when Pinchas saw, that no one acted&nbsp;upon Moses’ instructions;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">25,8. וידקור את שניהם, “and he stabbed both of them to&nbsp;death at the same time.” If in the process he became ritually&nbsp;unclean, there was nothing wrong with this, as our sages&nbsp;have said Pinchas only became a priest </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">after </span><span class="font5">he had killed&nbsp;Zimri, so that he had not been subject to the commandment&nbsp;not to knowingly become ritually unclean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל קבתה</span><span class="font5">, “through her belly.” The word is used in the sense of piercing a hole in Kings II 12,10: ויקב חור בדלתו, “he&nbsp;bored a hole through its door.”</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Pinchas</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;השיב את חמתי</span><span class="font5">, “he turned away My wrath;” this&nbsp;has been spelled out when the Torah wrote on Numbers&nbsp;25,8: ותעצר המגפה, “the plague stopped.” This being so, no&nbsp;Israelite had any reason to hate Pinchas for having killed&nbsp;Zimri, as it had resulted in a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">blessing</span><span class="font5"> for the other Israelites.&nbsp;The leader of the tribe of Shimon had certainly proved to be&nbsp;unworthy of that position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את בריתי שלום</span><span class="font5">, “My covenant of peace.” He has&nbsp;no reason to fear the vengeance of either the relatives of&nbsp;Zimri or of Cosbi, the Midianite princess. The expression: את&nbsp;בריתי שלום, is to be understood as if the Torah had written: את&nbsp;בריתי, ברית שלום, “My covenant, the covenant of peace.” We&nbsp;find a similar construction in Psalms 45,7: כסאך אלוקים, “Your&nbsp;throne, G’d,” which is to be understood as if the author had&nbsp;written: כסאך כסא אלוקים, Your throne, the throne of G’d. We&nbsp;also find such a construction in Joshua 3,14: הארון הברית,&nbsp;which is to be understood as if the author had written: ,הארון&nbsp;ארון הברית, “the Ark, the Ark of the covenant.” The author&nbsp;states that he could cite numerous such examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the expression: בריתי שלום: Pinchas had been worried that as a result of his having killed&nbsp;a human being, something forbidden to do for a priest, he&nbsp;might have to forego his status as a priest. G’d therefore&nbsp;assured him that seeing that his intention was to glorify the&nbsp;name of the Lord, he need not fear such consequences. This&nbsp;will be spelled out forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ברית כהונת עולם</span><span class="font5">, “the covenant of an everlasting&nbsp;priesthood;” All the High Priests following the High Priest&nbsp;Pinchas, who succeeded his father Elazar, who functioned&nbsp;during the period of the first Temple, and even beyond,&nbsp;during the early period of the second Temple were direct&nbsp;descendants of Pinchas as spelled out in Chronicles I 5,30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר הכה את המדינית</span><span class="font5">, “who had been slain with the&nbsp;Midianite woman;” the word: את, here means the same as עם,&nbsp;“with.” Our sages state that if Zimri had separated his body&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">from Cosbi in time, he would not have been killed by&nbsp;Pinchas’ lance. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> folio 82.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">צרור</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> את המדינים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> “Harass the Midianites!” The use&nbsp;of the infinitive mode </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tzaror,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> indicates that this was not a&nbsp;command to be carried out immediately. We know this from&nbsp;the fact that the details for the preparations of the punitive&nbsp;expedition against Midian have only been spelled out in&nbsp;Numbers 31,2. It has been mentioned here in order to put at&nbsp;ease the mind of the Israelites who had lost 24000 men of&nbsp;military age due to the involvement of Midianite women at the&nbsp;instigation of their husbands in a quarrel that had not&nbsp;concerned them at all, and they appeared to have gotten&nbsp;away with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">צרור את המזינים, “the commandment to harass the Midianites and not the Moabites, was because whatever the&nbsp;Moabites had done, they had done because they had&nbsp;believed that they had a legitimate reason to fear for their&nbsp;lives from the Israelites. Furthermore, the Israelites had&nbsp;already taken possession of lands which used to be theirs&nbsp;before Sichon had conquered it from them in war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי צוררים הם לכם, “for they have initiated hostilities&nbsp;with you by their wiles. The Israelites therefore would now be&nbsp;instructed to carry out the principle that if someone has&nbsp;demonstrated that he means to kill you, it is up to you to preempt him before he can carry out his evil plan. The&nbsp;Midianites’ sin was to try and seduce the Israelites into&nbsp;committing sexually forbidden carnal activities with their&nbsp;wives. Therefore the Israelites, instead of avenging&nbsp;themselves on Pinchas, were to avenge themselves on the&nbsp;Midianites who had even sacrificed a princess as part of that&nbsp;scheme. [The Land of Midian was hundreds of kilometers&nbsp;south of the land of Canaan on the Arabian peninsula. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Although Cosbi was not literally the daughter of the highest ranking Midianite, “their sister,” as stated in our&nbsp;verse, seeing that three verses previously she had been&nbsp;described as of lower rank, i.e. the daughter of Tzor, one of&nbsp;the princes of Midian, but not the highest one, the fact that&nbsp;she sacrificed her life for what she perceived as her highest&nbsp;patriotic duty, was the reason that she was accorded a&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">higher rank here, as equivalent to being a leader of her&nbsp;nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,19. ויהי אחרי המגפה</span><span class="font5">, “it was after the plague;” the “plague” referred to here is the dying in the desert of the&nbsp;generation of the adult Israelite males who had been&nbsp;redeemed from Egypt, but had lacked the faith to try and&nbsp;conquer the land of Canaan. This short phrase is described&nbsp;as an entire chapter despite its containing only three words.&nbsp;Our sages separated these three words from what preceded&nbsp;them by a cantillation mark indicating that a paragraph had&nbsp;been concluded. This is followed by another census of the&nbsp;Jewish males of military age prior to the crossing of the river&nbsp;Jordan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שאו את ראש כל עדת בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “take the sum of all</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the congregation of Israel from twenty years old and up;” once the count had been completed the Torah continues&nbsp;(verse 53) “to these the land will be divided up.” It describes&nbsp;that the amount of or quality of the various parts of the&nbsp;country will vary with the size of each tribe, so that it will be&nbsp;distributed fairly. (Numbers 26,54)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וידבר משה ואלעזר הכהן אותם</span><span class="font5">, “Moses and Elazar the&nbsp;priest spoke with them;” They told them that G’d had&nbsp;commanded that another census be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the word אותם (spelled without the letter ו) means that they spoke “with” the people&nbsp;not to the people. Compare Ezekiel 16,60: וזכרתי את בריתי אותך&nbsp;בימי נעוריך, “I remembered My covenant </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with y</span><span class="font5">ou made when&nbsp;you were in your youth.”</span></p><h1 dir="rtl"><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font5">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר צוה ה׳ את משה ובני ישראל היוצאים מארץ מצרים .26,4</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">“as the Lord G’d had commanded Moses and the Children of Israel when they were departing from the Land of Egypt.” At&nbsp;that time the males twenty years and older had also been&nbsp;counted. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,5. משפחת הפלאי</span><span class="font5">, “the family of the Pal-iy.” Actually, this family did not reach the land of Israel as the Reuvenites&nbsp;except for the family of Nemuel, the latter’s great grandson&nbsp;perished during the uprising of Korach. (Compare verse 8-9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,7.אלה משפחות הראובני</span><span class="font5">, “These are the families of the tribe of Reuven, etc.” the letters ה and י, symbolising the&nbsp;name of G’d at the beginning and end respectively of the&nbsp;names of some of these tribes during the census are found&nbsp;only for the tribes Reuven, Shimon and Zevulun. In the case&nbsp;of Reuven and Shimon the reason was to appease them&nbsp;because of Reuven’s their founding father’s indiscretion with&nbsp;his father’s concubine Bilhah, and of the far more recent&nbsp;disgrace of so many of the tribe of Shimon who had become&nbsp;guilty of sleeping with Moabite women at Shittim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the case of Zevulun, the reason is because members of this tribe had risked their lives several times and they had&nbsp;been commended for this by Devorah in her song of victory&nbsp;in Judges 5,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,9.'בהצותם על ה</span><span class="font5">, “when they agitated against the Lord.” Rav Chisda (in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> folio 110) stated that anyone who&nbsp;agitates against his Rabbi is as if he had agitated against the&nbsp;Lord Himself. [Korach had agitated against Moses, his Rabbi.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובני קרח לא מתו</span><span class="font5">, “and the sons of Korach had not&nbsp;died;” [during the uprising. Ed.] Even though they were&nbsp;Levites, the Torah here refers to them as if they had been&nbsp;part of the tribe of Reuven, seeing that the wickedness of the&nbsp;members of the tribe of Reuven, Datan and Aviram, had&nbsp;been greater than that of Korach, even. Korach’s sons not&nbsp;having joined the rebellion, or having repented in time, was&nbsp;therefore even more remarkable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לנמואל</span><span class="font5">, this person is the same as the one who&nbsp;appears elsewhere with the name ימואל. (Genesis 46,10, i.e.&nbsp;ובני שמעון ימואל)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לזרח</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments here that the family of&nbsp;Ohad, had become extinct. He adds that also five of the sons&nbsp;of Binyamin’s family had become extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> writes further that what was true of the family of Ohad of the tribe of Reuven, also applied to the family of&nbsp;Etzbon of the tribe of Gad. He explains that that Ozni in&nbsp;verse 16 of our chapter was in fact identical with Etzbon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning of the text this was because they had not founded a family, i.e. had not married.&nbsp;If you were to ask that if this is correct where was the&nbsp;seventh family of which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> wrote that it had become&nbsp;extinct? We might have to assume that the missing family is&nbsp;that of Yishveh of the tribe of Asher. (Compare Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">46,17, and Numbers 26,44, and the discrepancy in those two&nbsp;verses.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> also writes that four families of the tribe of Levi appear to have disappeared between the first and the&nbsp;second census, i.e. the families of Shi-ee, Azieli, and some&nbsp;of the family of Yitzhar of whom only the family of Korach is&nbsp;listed here. This is certainly not meant to be an enumeration&nbsp;as only one third of the family are mentioned here when&nbsp;compared to the list in Exodus 6,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our author continues to quote lengthy comments by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on this problem. [I have decided that the interested&nbsp;reader will prefer to read the text of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> for himself. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.15.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לצפון, this man is identical with צפיון in Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">46,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לאזני</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> he is identical with&nbsp;Etzbon, as I have already explained on verse 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,20. לפרץ</span><span class="font5">, the sons of Peretz were divided into three&nbsp;families; one bore the name of its founder, and the other two&nbsp;were Chetzron and Chamul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,24. לישוב</span><span class="font5">, he is identical with Yov in Genesis 46,13.&nbsp;Seeing that one of the two letters ש that had been part of his&nbsp;father’s name, he was not named after his father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,29. בני מנשה למכיר</span><span class="font5">, “as for the sons of Menashe, the ones of Machir, etc.” The names of all the tribes are listed&nbsp;here in the same sequence as they have been listed in&nbsp;Numbers chapter one, with the exception of Ephrayim and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Menashe; in this instance Menashe has been named first. The principal reason maybe that it numbered so many more&nbsp;men of military age than the descendants of Ephrayim. While&nbsp;the Jewish people had been in the desert, the number of&nbsp;members of the tribe of Ephrayim had been greater than that&nbsp;of the descendants of Menashe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, the flag of Ephrayim’s army group had been the leader of its group, and in that chapter the subject&nbsp;of the flags had first been mentioned, and a tribe leading&nbsp;such a contingent takes precedence over one that merely is&nbsp;an adjunct. In our chapter where the subject is the impending&nbsp;distribution of parts of the Holy Land to the various tribes of&nbsp;the Jewish people, mentioning Menashe, Joseph’s firstborn&nbsp;son first seems appropriate. After all, half of that tribe had&nbsp;also been assigned a substantial portion of their inheritance&nbsp;on the east bank of the Jordan, alongside the tribes of&nbsp;Reuven and Gad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למכיר </span><span class="font5">“to Machir;” the sons of Machir were divided amongst five families, one bearing the name of its founding&nbsp;father, and the others bearing the names of Gilead, and the&nbsp;sixth of the sixth bearing the name of its founder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,36. ואלה בני שותלח</span><span class="font5">, “and these are the sons of Shutelach, etc.; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> invites us to count all the families&nbsp;listed arriving at a count of 57 families for the 12 (13) tribes of&nbsp;plus eight families from the tribe of Levi. Actually, a look at&nbsp;our portion shows that the tribe of Levi comprised only 5 and&nbsp;a half families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shutelach’s family was divided into two families one named after its head and the other after Eyran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.38. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לבלע</span><span class="font5">, to Bela, etc;” the sons of Bela were divided&nbsp;into three families, one named after its founder, two after&nbsp;Arad and Naamon,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאחירם</span><span class="font5">, he is identical with Ehi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לשפופם</span><span class="font5">, he is identical with מופים, in Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">46,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לחופם</span><span class="font5">, he is identical with חופים, in the verse just quoted. Five of Binyamin’s sons had died, i.e. בכר,גרא,נעמן,ראש&nbsp;and ארד. This is what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> had referred to on verse 13,&nbsp;when he wrote that 5 of Binyamin’s family were extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,40. בני בלע ערד ונעמן</span><span class="font5">, the sons of Bela, Ard and Naamon; Bela had named his two sons in commemoration of&nbsp;two of his brothers who had died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,44. בני אשר </span><span class="font5">the sons of Asher. Yishveh is missing in&nbsp;this list, and this is why </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains concerning Ozni, that&nbsp;he was identical with the family of Itzbon. If we were to&nbsp;assume that the family of Itzbon had died or been killed in&nbsp;war, there would be eight families missing from the previous&nbsp;census not only seven, five from Binyamin, Ohad, Itzbon,&nbsp;and Yishveh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לבריעה</span><span class="font5">, of Beriah; the sons of Betriah were divided into three families, one was named after its founder, and Chever&nbsp;and Malkiel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,46.ושם בת אשר סרח</span><span class="font5">, “whereas the name of Asher’s daughter was Serach.” We would have expected the Torah&nbsp;to write simply בת אשר סרח, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">Asher’s daughter was Serach.” It&nbsp;appears that the reason why the Torah chose this&nbsp;longwinded version of saying the same thing was because it&nbsp;wished to give us a reason for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">why </span><span class="font5">she was called “Serach.”&nbsp;She was generally referred to as “Asher’s daughter,” seeing&nbsp;she had grown up in his house although she was not&nbsp;biologically his daughter but his wife’s daughter. This also&nbsp;seems to be confirmed by the Targum who wrote: “and the&nbsp;name of Asher’s wife daughter was Serach.” The question&nbsp;remains open what was the name of her mother, if one of the&nbsp;sons of Yaakov had sired her, why did he not give her his&nbsp;name? If she was sired by a gentile, why was she counted as&nbsp;part of Yaakov’s offspring in Genesis chapter 46 and as a&nbsp;sister to Asher’s sons?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps we may speculate that since she was known by her first name primarily as she had performed many&nbsp;worthy deeds, the title: “and her name was,” preceded her&nbsp;actual name, as a compliment. In the list of Yaakov’s&nbsp;offspring who went down to Egypt with Yaakov her name is&nbsp;listed preceding her status. (Genesis 46,17). This may have&nbsp;been due to her being much older than her younger brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word: ושם, “and the name of,” before her actual name, suggests that “her name preceded her,” she had been&nbsp;well known for her deeds of charity, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.50. ואלה משפחות נפתלי</span><span class="font5">, “and these are the families&nbsp;from the tribe of Naftali;” this concludes the total of the&nbsp;families from the various tribes excluding those from the tribe&nbsp;of Levi, fifty seven families in all. The southern army&nbsp;command headed by the flag (tribe) of Reuven had four&nbsp;families from Reuven, five from Shimon and seven families&nbsp;from the tribe of Gad. The eastern army command headed&nbsp;by the tribe of Yehudah, had five families from that tribe, four&nbsp;families from the tribe of Issachar, and three families from the&nbsp;tribe of Zevulun. The western army command headed by&nbsp;Menashe comprised eight families from that tribe, four&nbsp;families from the tribe of Ephrayim, and seven families from&nbsp;the tribe of Binyamin. The northern army command, headed&nbsp;by the tribe (flag) of Dan, had one family from that tribe, five&nbsp;families from the tribe of Asher, and four families from the&nbsp;tribe of Naftali.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.51. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'אלה פקודי בני ישראל וגו</span><span class="font5">, “these were those who&nbsp;were numbered among the Children of Israel, six hundred&nbsp;thousand, seventeen hundred and thirty.” This total is smaller&nbsp;than the total reported at the previous census by eighteen&nbsp;hundred and twenty. If this total had been greater than the&nbsp;previous total they would have said that they were now&nbsp;numerically strong enough to take on the Canaanites&nbsp;militarily. G’d wanted to demonstrate to the people under the&nbsp;command of Joshua that though there were slightly fewer&nbsp;Israelite soldiers than forty years earlier when the spies had&nbsp;considered themselves too weak to conquer the Canaanites,&nbsp;they still would manage to do so, not because of their&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">numbers</span><span class="font5"> but because of G’d’s assistance. When one enjoys&nbsp;His assistance numbers become irrelevant. (This point was&nbsp;made even more pronouncedly during the days of Gideon in&nbsp;Judges 7,7.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,53. לאלה</span><span class="font5">, “to these,” i.e. to the heads of these fifty seven families enumerated in this chapter the land will be&nbsp;divided up as ancestral inheritance. Each would receive a&nbsp;share corresponding to the number of family heads that had&nbsp;been numbered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.54. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'לרב תרבה וגו</span><span class="font5">, to the numerically more numerous,&nbsp;etc.” they did not all receive equally sized plots of land, but&nbsp;the number of males in each family determined the number&nbsp;of plots each would receive. This is why the Torah referred to&nbsp;“its numbered.” The word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איש </span><span class="font5">was added to exclude the&nbsp;number of women in each family as being irrelevant in this&nbsp;instance. It also excluded people of indeterminate sex. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">26.55.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אך</span><span class="font5">, nonetheless the aforesaid, Joshua and&nbsp;Calev, did not receive the share of the land according to the&nbsp;criteria mentioned, i.e. through lots, but by a direct command&nbsp;from G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אך בגורל יחלק את הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “but the land is to be divided up by the use of lots (lottery)” But before the land would be&nbsp;divided up into 57 parcels by lot naming each tribe’s family&nbsp;heads, it would be divided into 12 sections, one for each tribe&nbsp;excluding the tribe of Levi. These twelve sections would each&nbsp;be given the name of one of the tribes and be tossed into a&nbsp;container with the names of the twelve tribes separately, and&nbsp;the respective parcels of land separately. The person&nbsp;monitoring the lottery would pull out of one section of the&nbsp;container the name of a tribe and out of the other section of&nbsp;that container a slip of parchment with the boundaries of the&nbsp;section allocated to the tribe so named. It would be found&nbsp;miraculously that tribes with larger populations had drawn&nbsp;larger sections of the land to be settled on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He would show both these pieces of parchment to all those assembled, so that it would be clear that no favoritism&nbsp;had occurred. If the land had been divided initially into 57&nbsp;parcels according to the names of the heads of these 57&nbsp;families, and only subsequently into 12 sections, different&nbsp;families would find that they were to be located on land&nbsp;belonging to the portion of a different tribe. When Bileam,&nbsp;with his mind’s eye viewed the Jewish people on their land,&nbsp;he described them as וירא את ישראל שוכן </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">לשבטיו</span><span class="font5">, “he&nbsp;envisioned Israel as dwelling in an orderly fashion according&nbsp;to its respective tribes, (Numbers 24,2) something which&nbsp;resulted in his being overcome by holy spirit. We also have a&nbsp;verse in Numbers 36,7 according to which when a female&nbsp;inherited some land before the original division she could not&nbsp;marry out of her tribe so that her husband could not through&nbsp;inheriting her share of the land diminish that tribe’s ancestral&nbsp;part of the land of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לשמות מטות אביתם</span><span class="font5">, “according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.” This appendix is meant to exclude converts&nbsp;and freed slaves from participating in that lottery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.56. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על פי הגורל</span><span class="font5">, “according to the lot, etc.” i.e. after&nbsp;the 12 boundaries of the tribal territories had become known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תחלק נחלתו</span><span class="font5">, “shall each family’ share of inherited land be determined in accordance with the number of families in&nbsp;each tribe, i.e. four for the tribe of Reuven, and five for the&nbsp;tribe of Shimon, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בין רב למעט</span><span class="font5">, “between the more numerous ones and the less numerous ones.” How did this work out in practice? Four&nbsp;sections of land were accorded to the four families of&nbsp;Reuven, two of whom were large families and two of whom&nbsp;were relatively small families. The large family had to divide&nbsp;up their parcel into three shares according to the parchments&nbsp;used in the lottery two shares of ancestral land went to the&nbsp;two larger families, the third section being re-divided and&nbsp;distributed to the two families who had fewer members. A&nbsp;pattern of distribution using the lottery was used throughout.&nbsp;All the families of the 12 tribes received their shares through&nbsp;having participated in a lottery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בין רב למעט</span><span class="font5">, the letter ל in the word למעט has a dot under it, making the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.57. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואלה פקודי הלוי</span><span class="font5">, “and these were they that were&nbsp;numbered among the Levites;” the purpose of that count was&nbsp;to apportion the 48 towns in which the Levites were to make&nbsp;their homes, fairly. This is spelled out in greater detail in the&nbsp;portion of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Massey</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,62. שלשה ועשרים אלף</span><span class="font5">, “twenty three thousand.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bamidbar Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 5,1 the Levites who carried&nbsp;the Holy Ark suffered losses in their numbers due to flashes&nbsp;of lightning emanating from that Ark from time to time.[This&nbsp;editor presumes that what is implied it is that not all the&nbsp;Levites all the time when engaged in that task had their&nbsp;minds on their holy task as they should have had. Or, seeing&nbsp;that the Levites had been counted not from the age of 20, but&nbsp;from the age of only one month, a number might have&nbsp;succumbed to sickness before they were strong enough. The&nbsp;number of adult Israelites involved in the census had hardly&nbsp;changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,1. ותקרבנה בנות צלפחד בן חפר</span><span class="font5">, “The daughters of Tz’lofchod son of Chefer, approached; when they realised&nbsp;that only the males were being counted preparatory to the&nbsp;division of the land in the Land of Israel, including those of&nbsp;the family of Chefer, but not including them, and Tz’lofchod&nbsp;their father had also not been included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,3. והוא לא היה בתוך העדה</span><span class="font5">, “and he had not been among the rebels in the uprising of Korach against Moses;”&nbsp;neither had he been twenty years of age when the debacle&nbsp;with the spies had occurred, so that he could not have been&nbsp;included in the Israelites that G’d had vowed that they would&nbsp;not live to take part in the conquest on the land of Canaan at&nbsp;the appointed time. He had died as the result of a very&nbsp;personal sin, none that would result in his being denied a&nbsp;claim to ancestral land in the Land lof Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,5. ויקרב משה את משפט</span><span class="font5">ן, “he submitted their legal claim to G’d;” Moses knew that women are entitled to inherit. What&nbsp;he did not know or agreed with, was if people such as&nbsp;Tz’lofchod had only a potential claim to such land, and that&nbsp;seeing that he never set foot on the land that he was still&nbsp;entitled to pass on that claim to his daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,7. נתון תתן להם נחלה</span><span class="font5">, “you are certainly to give them ancestral land as their inheritance.” It was really the&nbsp;inheritance of their father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בתוך אחי אביהם</span><span class="font5">, “among the inheritance of their father’s brothers, i.e. this was all a part of their grandfather’s&nbsp;inheritance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">להם אחוזת נחלה בתוך אחי אביהם</span><span class="font5">, this is already the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">fourth time that the Torah refers to the daughters of Tz’lofchod with the masculine pronoun instead of the&nbsp;feminine one. [Note that Moses does not refer to them with&nbsp;the masculine pronoun ending. Ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,12 עלה אל הר העברים</span><span class="font5">, “ascend the Mount Avarim!;” what is missing before this verse is that Moses had prayed to&nbsp;cross the Jordan, even as a private in order to see the Holy&nbsp;and, and that G’d had told him that he would see it only from&nbsp;afar, i.e. from the top of Mount Avarim. [Compare&nbsp;Deuteronomy 3,23, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,13. כאשר נאסף אהרן אחיך</span><span class="font5">, “just as your brother Aaron has been gathered.” G’d refers to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">reason</span><span class="font5"> of their dying&nbsp;before entering the Holy Land, not to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">manner</span><span class="font5"> of their&nbsp;death, seeing that Moses had buried his brother Aaron,&nbsp;whereas no none was present at his own death. Their&nbsp;“premature” death had been due to their having failed to&nbsp;exploit an opportunity to sanctify the Holy Name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">(Numbers 20,12). This is what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on our&nbsp;verse. He adds that this verse is really not at the place where&nbsp;we would have expected it. It really belonged to the portion of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ha-azinu,</span><span class="font5"> where the Torah describes the sin of Moses and&nbsp;Aaron in different terms, i.e. violating a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">negative&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">commandment not just failing to observe a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">positive&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">commandment. (Compare Deuteronomy 32,51) According to&nbsp;the commentary in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri,</span><span class="font5"> the verse is appropriate here as the&nbsp;sin Moses and Aaron had been guilty of occurred in the&nbsp;desert of Tzin, immediately after Miriam had died and been&nbsp;buried, not in the fields of Moav where Moses made his final&nbsp;speech to the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar is on record as saying that both Moses and Aaron died prematurely as a result of failing&nbsp;to sanctify the name of G’d as stated in Numbers 20. It is&nbsp;possible that out of deference to the image of Moses and&nbsp;Aaron, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> preferred not to mention the statement of Rabbi&nbsp;Shimon ben Elazar. He only quoted the last item in that&nbsp;comment by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27, 16. ה' אלוקי הרוחות לכל בשר</span><span class="font5">, “Lord, G’d of the spirits of all flesh;” compare Ezekiel 1,12 for a better understanding of&nbsp;this expression; Moses describes G’d as inspiring the spirit in&nbsp;man proceeds with any worthwhile undertaking and his&nbsp;perseverance in pursuing it undaunted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתתה מהודן* עליו</span><span class="font5">, “and you shall divert part of your&nbsp;majesty to him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">we find a similar formulation to this in Daniel&nbsp;11,21: ולא נתנו עליו הוד מלכות, “upon whom they did not confer&nbsp;the majesty of kingship.” Moses is asked by G’d to honour&nbsp;Joshua publicly as his successor, so that the people will&nbsp;accept him as such and will obey his instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27.21</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולפני אלעזר הכהן יעמוד</span><span class="font5">, “and he will </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">stand</span><span class="font5"> in the&nbsp;presence of the High Priest Elazar;” so that he will not&nbsp;consider himself as superior to him and become boastful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,23. ויסמוך את ידיו</span><span class="font5">, “he laid his hands upon him.” This was similar to people offering animal sacrifices placing their&nbsp;hands and weight on these animals prior to their being&nbsp;slaughtered. The owner of the animals symbolically&nbsp;transferred his essence to the animal which would take his&nbsp;place instead, seeing that he really should have been the&nbsp;sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From this action it became clear that Moses transferred his authority to Joshua willingly, as instead of placing only&nbsp;one hand on him as G’d had commanded him, he did so with&nbsp;both of his hands. Army commanders in the future would also&nbsp;be appointed by their superiors placing their hands on their&nbsp;juniors when promoting them. Compare author on Numbers&nbsp;2,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,2. תשמרו להקריב לי</span><span class="font5">, “you shall observe in order to offer for Me.” Just as the word שמירה in connection with the&nbsp;lambs for the Passover meant: “close supervision, to prevent&nbsp;any blemish developing,” so here too the meaning is “close&nbsp;supervision prior to slaughtering the daily communal animal&nbsp;sacrifices.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">להקריב לי במועדו</span><span class="font5">, “to present to Me at its appointed time.” This applies even if the appointed time occurs on the&nbsp;Sabbath, or if the person offering it is temporarily ritually&nbsp;unclean. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri)</span><span class="font5"> [I did not find the reference to ritual&nbsp;impurity in my edition of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.] According to the&nbsp;author, it must mean that if no priest can be found on that&nbsp;day that is ritually pure. This offering must not be skipped&nbsp;even during time of war. [There are stories in the Talmud&nbsp;describing that the priests paid fortunes to the besieging&nbsp;Babylonians or Romans to supply such animals for them. Ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find that the angel remonstrated with Joshua for not having seen to it that this offering was offered while the army&nbsp;laid siege to Jericho (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah</span><span class="font5"> folio 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the emphasis here is on the word במועדו, “at its appointed time,” it must neither be offered&nbsp;too early in the morning nor too late in the afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את הכבש אחד</span><span class="font5">, “the one sheep;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that&nbsp;although this commandment had already been written in&nbsp;Exodus 29,38, at that time it applied only to the days during&nbsp;which the priests were consecrated. Now it applies&nbsp;permanently. If you were to argue that we find the word:&nbsp;לדורותיכם, “for your generations,” in the passage containing&nbsp;this law in Exodus, the word there might be understood as&nbsp;applying only to the minimum number of generations, i.e. two&nbsp;generations, whereas here it applies to all future generations&nbsp;when the Temple would be standing. This is also why it is&nbsp;introduced herewith the word: צו, “issue a command!” (verse&nbsp;2) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifra,</span><span class="font5"> at the beginning of the portion </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tzav.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">28.5.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשירית האיפה סלת</span><span class="font5">, “and the tenth of an eyphah of&nbsp;fine flour;” just as the “fine flour” mentioned in the passage in&nbsp;Exodus referred to flour from wheat, so here too it refers to&nbsp;flour ground from wheat. (Exodus 29,42). Whenever the&nbsp;Torah mentions the word סלת, it refers to fine flour made from&nbsp;wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בשמן כתית</span><span class="font5">, “with beaten oil;” the olives were ground in a mortar and oil resulting was squeezed out by hand. It was&nbsp;not stored in a vat to prevent any residue from accumulating&nbsp;at the bottom of the vat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">רביעית ההין, </span><span class="font5">a quarter of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hin,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. three </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">logs</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עולת תמיד העשויה בהר סיני</span><span class="font5">, “it is a continual burnt&nbsp;offering which was offered at Mount Sinai. In other words,&nbsp;this practice began when the Jewish people were encamped&nbsp;around Mount Sinai, as we know from Exodus 24,5: וישלח את&nbsp;נערי בני ישראל ויעלו עולות, “Moses sent forth the young men of&nbsp;the Children of Israel and they offered burnt offerings. He&nbsp;intended that this practice should remain in use forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכנסכו</span><span class="font5">, “and as its drink-offering;” this is a&nbsp;reference to the libation consisting of wine, as well as to the&nbsp;drink offering accompanying the communal gift offering&nbsp;presented every morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וביום השבת, </span><span class="font5">“and on every Sabbath, etc.” All of the&nbsp;offerings are described as being offered with either the word&nbsp;עשיה, something being carried out, or with the word הקרבה,&nbsp;something being presented. Seeing that basically such&nbsp;activities as offering sacrifices are forbidden on the Sabbath,&nbsp;the Torah avoids the use of these terms in connection with&nbsp;the communal offerings that are mandatory on the Sabbath&nbsp;nonetheless. The reader may therefore be misled by the&nbsp;absence of these words in connection with the communal&nbsp;offerings on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שני כבשים</span><span class="font5">, “two male sheep” the Torah did not demand more than the minimal as additional communal sacrifices on&nbsp;the Sabbath. In fact that additional offering is equal to the&nbsp;daily morning and evening offerings. No sin offering is&nbsp;offered on the Sabbath as a communal offering, contrary to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">musspah,</span><span class="font5"> additional offerings on the various festival&nbsp;days. The major reason is that seeing that parts of the sin&nbsp;offerings were meant to be consumed by the priests, the&nbsp;Torah did not want them to benefit from animals that were&nbsp;slaughtered on the Sabbath, something that in their private&nbsp;lives they were not allowed to do on the Sabbath. The&nbsp;Sabbath was “desecrated” only for offerings which were&nbsp;presented only to G’d. This is why the Torah adds the words:&nbsp;רצית קרבנותיה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">You received the offerings pertaining to the&nbsp;Sabbath with goodwill.” The exception to this rule is when&nbsp;New Moon occurs on the Sabbath and there is an additional&nbsp;offering including a sin offering on that day, due to the&nbsp;calendar day occurring on the Sabbath. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span><span class="font5"> At any&nbsp;rate, on ordinary Sabbath days the Torah made a distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונסכו</span><span class="font5">, “and the drink offering thereof.” This again refers to a libation consisting of wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עולת שבת בשבתו, </span><span class="font5">“the burnt offering for the&nbsp;Sabbath, on its Sabbath; Festival days and New Moon both&nbsp;have an element of enabling atonement connected to them.&nbsp;This is why the Jewish people are advised of these days&nbsp;ahead of time, and are called upon to do repentance on&nbsp;them. Our sages tell us in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;31, that as long as we read from the Torah the sections&nbsp;dealing with these days on their respective days or on the&nbsp;Sabbath preceding them, we are considered as if we had&nbsp;offered the sacrifices ordained to be offered on those days&nbsp;even if we had been prevented from doings so, such as&nbsp;when in exile and there being no Temple to do so. [On some&nbsp;of the festivals G’d sits in judgment of parts of His creation,&nbsp;such as the fruit of the earth, the trees, or if there will be&nbsp;sufficient rain, etc.. Since His decisions affect us greatly,&nbsp;doing some penitence even on those days is very&nbsp;appropriate, and is reflected in our liturgy on those days, and&nbsp;we do not restrict ourselves to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah</span><span class="font5"> and the Day&nbsp;of Atonement. Ed.] In connection with the additional&nbsp;communal offerings on the Sabbath, no hint of the day&nbsp;serving as atonement in any form is given. The offerings on&nbsp;that day have only one objective, to provide G’d with a&nbsp;pleasant fragrance from His children, i.e. ריח ניחוח. This is&nbsp;also why the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mussaph</span><span class="font5"> prayer on the Sabbath is quite&nbsp;differently worded from the parallel prayers on the festivals.&nbsp;In those prayers the fact that we have been sinful and are&nbsp;therefore still in exile, is not mentioned with a single word or&nbsp;hint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונסכה, </span><span class="font5">“and its drink offering.” This is a reference to the drink offerings consisting of wine accompanying the daily&nbsp;communal burnt offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,11. ובראשי חדשיכם</span><span class="font5">, “and on your New moon days, etc.;” this paragraph refers specifically to the day ushering in&nbsp;the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan,</span><span class="font5"> the month in which we were redeemed&nbsp;from Egypt -our national birthday-as specifically stated in&nbsp;Exodus 12,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פרים בני בקר שנים ואיל אחד</span><span class="font5">, “two young bullocks and one ram;” The same animals are to be offered as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">offerings on Passover and on the festival of weeks, 50 days&nbsp;later; New Moon and these festivals are occasions when a&nbsp;great number of Jewish people are assembled around the&nbsp;Temple in Jerusalem. On </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah,</span><span class="font5"> the Day of&nbsp;Atonement and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’mini Atzeret,</span><span class="font5"> only one young bullock is&nbsp;offered as part of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph</span><span class="font5"> offering. On </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the reason is that there is anyways another bullock that is the&nbsp;burnt offering of the new Moon which occurs on the same&nbsp;date. On the day of Atonement, the bullock offered by the&nbsp;High Priest on his own behalf consists of a young bullock.&nbsp;Also, one of the male goats serves as a sin offering for the&nbsp;whole people, a source for their atonement on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shimini Atzeret,</span><span class="font5"> after for seven days a total of 70 bullocks had been offered on behalf of the seventy nations of&nbsp;the world, one, such young bullock is offered on behalf of the&nbsp;Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בחדשו</span><span class="font5">, of every new moon, i.e. at the time when&nbsp;the lunar cycle renews itself. It must be offered on that day,&nbsp;and no other day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושעיר עזים</span><span class="font5">, “as well as one he-goat;” this is to&nbsp;serve as sin offering for the whole Jewish community. It&nbsp;symbolises the guilt of the whole Jewish people, i.e. the 10&nbsp;brothers of Joseph who had been involved in his sale, and&nbsp;who had never offered an atonement offering at the time. In&nbsp;connection with this he-goat, the Torah adds the words: “for&nbsp;the Lord,” meaning that all of these sin offerings had to be&nbsp;offered as “for the sake of heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על עולת </span><span class="font5">“together with the burnt offerings already mentioned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על עולת התמיד יעשה ונסכו</span><span class="font5">, “it shall be offered as a continual burnt offering together with its drink offering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונסכו</span><span class="font5">, this word, as on previous occasions, refers to the libation consisting of wine as a gift offering on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,18. מקרא קדש</span><span class="font5">, “a holy convocation.” Although the&nbsp;word מקרא appears with the letter א at the end, it is to be&nbsp;understood as if it had been spelled with the letter ה at the&nbsp;end meaning: ”a happening.” The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum</span><span class="font5"> renders the verse&nbsp;as referring to a מערע, “a happy gathering involving food and&nbsp;drink, and fancy dress.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל מלאכת עבודה</span><span class="font5">, “any manner of servile work;” this type of work is prohibited to be carried out on such a day,&nbsp;whereas work involving the preparation of food and drink is&nbsp;permissible. This is the reason why the Torah here did not&nbsp;write as it did concerning work on the Sabbath: כל </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">מלאכה</span><span class="font5"> לא&nbsp;תעשו, “you must not perform any manner of מלאכה, but only&nbsp;forbade: “servile type of work.” כל מלאכת עבודה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,19. תמימים יהיו לכם</span><span class="font5">, “they shall be free from blemish, for you.” If animals used as communal offerings on the&nbsp;Sabbaths or festivals should have a blemish disqualifying&nbsp;them as offerings, slaughtering such animals on the Sabbath&nbsp;or festival would be a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">grave </span><span class="font5">sin. It would even be forbidden&nbsp;to remove the skins of such animals on either the Sabbath or&nbsp;the festival. This is why the prophet Ezekiel, Ezekiel 22,8&nbsp;stated: קדשי בזית ואת שבתותי חללת</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">you have despised My&nbsp;holy things, and you have profaned My Sabbaths.” This is&nbsp;also why no mention is made of the animals for the offerings&nbsp;on New Moon having to be free from blemish. It is clear that&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">animals for offerings must be free from blemishes on any&nbsp;day of the week, but if these animals are offered on a day&nbsp;when certain work must not be performed, if such an animal&nbsp;is nonetheless being offered, the person doing so has&nbsp;committed an </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">additional</span><span class="font5"> sin, that of profaning the holiness of&nbsp;the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,24. כאלה תעשו ליום שבעת ימים</span><span class="font5">, “After this manner you shall present offerings for seven consecutive days;”&nbsp;previously, when this festival had been discussed in Leviticus&nbsp;in the latter part of chapter 23, where not the offerings but the&nbsp;location of them in our own land are the central focus of the&nbsp;Torah, the blessings related to these festivals are&nbsp;highlighted, and therefore our gratitude for them. In this&nbsp;chapter the Torah highlights the details of the offerings to be&nbsp;presented on those occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונסכו</span><span class="font5">, and its drink offering;” the verse refers to the words: 'לחם אשה לה, at the beginning of our verse, i.e. “the&nbsp;food of the offering for G’d made by fire;” what is meant&nbsp;specifically are the drink offerings accompanying the animal&nbsp;offerings as gift offerings, מנחה, including the meal (baked&nbsp;flour) parts of such offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,26. וביום הבכורים</span><span class="font5">, “And on the day of offering the first fruits, etc,” The reason why this day is called: “the day of the&nbsp;first fruits,” is that commencing with that date the farmer can&nbsp;present such fruit from the current harvest in the Temple as&nbsp;his gift to G’d, i.e. the priests, His terrestrial representatives.&nbsp;The verse failed to mention the month, and from which day of&nbsp;that month this regulation applies. I have already explained&nbsp;the reason for this omission in my commentary on Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">23,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בשבועותיכם</span><span class="font5">, “on your feast of weeks;” the word is translated by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum</span><span class="font5"> as בעצרתיכון; since the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">appeared, or in deference to its author, the name of the&nbsp;festival has been changed to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Atzeret.</span><span class="font5"> [Presumably, this is on&nbsp;account of the stoppage of counting the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.]&nbsp;Previously, this festival had been known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שעיר עזים אחד</span><span class="font5">, “one male goat;” we have a&nbsp;statement recorded near the end of the Babylonian Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah,</span><span class="font5"> that in the land of Israel the&nbsp;scholars quoting Rabbi Mesharshia in the name of Rabbi&nbsp;Acha, draws attention to the fact that whereas with all the&nbsp;other such sacrifices the term used is חטאת, “sin-offering,”&nbsp;whereas here the reference to sin is omitted. He explains by&nbsp;quoting the Lord saying to the Israelites: “seeing that this is&nbsp;the anniversary of the day on which you voluntarily accepted&nbsp;the yoke of My Torah, I consider this as if you had not&nbsp;committed any sins to be atoned for prior to this day.”&nbsp;(Jerusalem Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah</span><span class="font5"> chapter 4, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachah</span><span class="font5"> 10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.31</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מלבד עולת התמיד</span><span class="font5">, “beside the daily burnt offering;”&nbsp;if you were to ask why the Torah did not write: beside the two&nbsp;showbreads, etc. etc., which are all part of the offerings&nbsp;presented on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Atzeret</span><span class="font5"> (as the Torah had done in connection&nbsp;with the New moon offerings, and the offerings on the Day of&nbsp;Atonement?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We would respond to this question by reminding the reader that earlier, in verse 26, these details had already&nbsp;been recorded so that there was no need to repeat them&nbsp;here again. Beside they referred to the gift offerings, not the&nbsp;principal offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונסכיהם, </span><span class="font5">“and their drink offerings.” This refers to the wine libations on the day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot</span><span class="font5"> and the meal offerings&nbsp;accompanying the principal offerings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,2. כבשי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בני שנה שבעה תמימי</span><span class="font5">ם, “seven unblemished male sheep one year old.” If you were to ask how this can be&nbsp;squared with the opinion of the scholar that on New Year the&nbsp;animals attain their “birthday,” [as opposed to the anniversary&nbsp;of their date of birth. Ed.] so that they are no longer one year&nbsp;old but are already in their second year, (Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Niddah</span><span class="font5"> folio 47) and we need a male sheep exactly one year&nbsp;old? (Tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parah</span><span class="font5"> chapter 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> 3)? We would have&nbsp;to answer that according to that scholar the eighth day of life&nbsp;of these sheep occurs on New Year’s so that they just began&nbsp;to qualify as potential offerings and had not yet entered their&nbsp;second year. They could not have been called two years old&nbsp;as the count of years did not begin until they were old&nbsp;enough to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">qualify </span><span class="font5">as potential sacrifices. (From the eighth&nbsp;day of their lives) Therefore, on the day when they were&nbsp;offered as sacrifices they had not entered their second year&nbsp;of “life.” The Torah had hinted at such a scenario when it&nbsp;wrote (Leviticus 22,27) “and from the eighth day onwards it is&nbsp;fit as a potential offering acceptable by G’d with goodwill.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,6. מלבד עולת החדש, </span><span class="font5">“in addition of the New Moon burnt offering;” if you were to ask why the Torah did not&nbsp;simply write: “in addition to the sin-offering for the New&nbsp;Moon,?” We would have to answer that all the burnt offerings&nbsp;have equal power to achieve atonement for its donors both&nbsp;those who transgressed negative commandments&nbsp;unintentionally and those who failed to perform negative&nbsp;commandments that are linked to the performance of a&nbsp;positive commandment. This works as follows: the burnt&nbsp;offerings of the new Moon achieve atonement for sins&nbsp;committed inadvertently, the sinner not having been aware of&nbsp;his sin when he committed it, nor after he had completed it.&nbsp;[He might have learned about the existence of such a&nbsp;commandment only after having become guilty of&nbsp;transgressing it. Ed.] Our sages explain this based on what is&nbsp;written in connection with the offering, the word 'לה, in verse&nbsp;15 being apparently superfluous, [unless we consider the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> which interprets it as a sin offering actually offered&nbsp;on behalf of G’d, Who makes amends for having reduced the&nbsp;moon in size, as the plain meaning of the text. (Compare&nbsp;Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> folio 60. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor</span><span class="font5"> shor) the New Year burnt offerings presented on the same day affords&nbsp;atonement to sinners who did not know when they began to&nbsp;commit the transgression in question that it was a&nbsp;transgression, but who had become aware of the nature of&nbsp;their transgression before having completely carried it out.&nbsp;On account of this nuance, the Torah did not call the act of&nbsp;transgression an outright sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונסכיהם</span><span class="font5">, “and their respective drink offerings.” This refers to the drink offerings accompanying the offerings on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah.</span><span class="font5"> It also includes the libations both of wine&nbsp;and meal offerings of both the burnt offering of the New&nbsp;Moon, and that of the daily communal burnt offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,7. ובעשר לחודש השביעי הזה, </span><span class="font5">“and on the tenth day of the seventh month in this year, etc.” the word: “this” refers to&nbsp;the month which the Torah had just kept calling the seventh&nbsp;month of the year [although the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">year</span><span class="font5"> began on the first day of&nbsp;this month. Ed.] The Torah therefore used the word “seventh”&nbsp;as referring to a year which had commenced with the month&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan.</span><span class="font5"> In Kings I 8,2, the author describes the month of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. ירח האיתנים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">the month in which we celebrate the&nbsp;festival of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot,</span><span class="font5"> as the seventh month, in connection with&nbsp;the consecration of the Temple which Solomon had built, and&nbsp;the celebrations for a full week after the festival of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Targum Yonathan on that verse states clearly that it was the month that the Torah had just described as the&nbsp;seventh month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,11. שעיר עזים אחד חטאת</span><span class="font5">, “one male goat, a sin-offering.” The words: ”in order to atone for you,” did not need to be added as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Day </span><span class="font5">itself is a day of Atonement. [If that&nbsp;were not so, how could we secure atonement every year on&nbsp;that date when we are in exile and have no Temple in which&nbsp;to present animal offerings? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מלבד חטאת הכפורים, </span><span class="font5">“beside the sin offering of atonement;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this: the reference is to the&nbsp;male goat offered on the altar inside the Sanctuary, the one&nbsp;referred to in Leviticus 16,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason the Torah did not mention this here is that we are dealing here only with the communal offerings, paid&nbsp;for by the Jewish public. The bullock offered on the Day of&nbsp;Atonement on behalf of Aaron was paid for by Aaron&nbsp;personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונסכיהם</span><span class="font5">, “and their drink-offerings.” This refers to the libations of wine and meal offerings of all the offerings that&nbsp;were presented on the Day of Atonement.</span></p><h1 dir="rtl"><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font5">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פרים בני בקר שלשה עשר, כבשים בני שנה ארבעה עשר .29,13</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">“thirteen young bullocks, fourteen male young sheep (who had not completed the first year of their lives.).” Seeing that&nbsp;the festival of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font5"> is more joyous than all the other&nbsp;festivals, because the year’s harvest had been brought to&nbsp;their barns prior to that time, and the people had&nbsp;acknowledged this with parading the palm fronds and citron,&nbsp;etc., it is not surprising that the communally financed&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph</span><span class="font5"> offerings should also reflect that additional joy and&nbsp;thanksgiving by being correspondingly more generous.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor).</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,19. ונסכיהם</span><span class="font5">, “and (together with) their drink-offerings.” When the expression נסך is used elsewhere it&nbsp;always refers to libations of wine and the oil and meal&nbsp;offerings. Seeing that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph</span><span class="font5"> offerings on the festival&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font5"> are different each day, the Torah here has to refer&nbsp;to these offerings repeatedly each day separately, as they&nbsp;were not the same as on the day mentioned previously. This&nbsp;was not the case with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph</span><span class="font5"> offerings on the seven&nbsp;days of Passover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,32. וביום השביעי פרים עשרה</span><span class="font5">, “and on the seventh day, ten young bullocks.” The total number of young bullocks&nbsp;offered on the seven days of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font5"> was seventy. This&nbsp;corresponded to the fifty two Sabbath days in the year, seven&nbsp;days of Passover, one day of Shavuot, one day of New Year,&nbsp;one day of Atonement, and eight days of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot/Sh’mini&nbsp;Atzeret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi<sub>3</span><span class="font5"></sub> the number symbolised the seventy gentile nations, and if offered during the period when&nbsp;the Temple was standing, they were meant to protect these&nbsp;nations from unpleasant sufferings. This is why G’d punished&nbsp;the gentile nations on that festival (Zecharyah 14, 18-19)&nbsp;more for their persecutions of the |sraelites on that festival,&nbsp;as once they had destroyed our Temple, we could no longer&nbsp;be interlocutors with G’d on their behalf by offering to Him&nbsp;these sacrifices as if we had been asked to do as their&nbsp;representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,34. ושעיר חטאת אחד, </span><span class="font5">“and one male goat;” the words: לכפר עליכם, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">to atone on your behalf,”</span><span class="font5"> do not appear in&nbsp;connection with the ones offered on the other days of the&nbsp;festival, as they were offered on behalf of the gentile nations,&nbsp;whereas on the last day of the festival the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph</span><span class="font5"> offering&nbsp;was presented on behalf of the Jewish people. Their&nbsp;atonement, if any, had no connection with the atonement&nbsp;granted to the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of this: the Israelites were not yet in need of any atonement having been forgiven their&nbsp;sins on the Day of Atonement four days before the&nbsp;commencement of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font5"> festival, and having spent the&nbsp;last eight days busy with performing a large number of&nbsp;additional commandments. Proof of this is that we do not&nbsp;read about: “to atone on your behalf,” on any day after the&nbsp;Day of Atonement in this chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ביום השמיני</span><span class="font5">, “on the eighth day;” the Torah does&nbsp;not use the connective letter ו when introducing this&nbsp;paragraph, in order to teach us that this day was considered&nbsp;a festival in its own right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עצרת תהיה לכם, </span><span class="font5">“it is to be an assembly for you;” (alternative translation: a restriction) this is why it is called:,&nbsp;“the eighth day, the festival of assembly.” שמיני חג העצרת. This&nbsp;is also why the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shavuot</span><span class="font5"> festival is also called: עצרת, as the&nbsp;Torah has written in 28,26: בשבועותיכם which the Targum&nbsp;translated בעצרותיכן, “on your gatherings, detention;” this term&nbsp;has not been applied to the seventh day of Passover, where&nbsp;it only said: “for the Lord your G’d.” [The Torah also had&nbsp;given specific permission for the people who had made the&nbsp;pilgrimage to Jerusalem for Passover, to leave for home on&nbsp;the morning after having consumed same. (Deut. 16,7) Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום השמיני עצרת תהיה לכם</span><span class="font5">, “on the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly.” If all this is so important why did&nbsp;the sages permit us to leave the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sukkah</span><span class="font5"> on the seventh day&nbsp;already? The reason is so that we would feel the need to&nbsp;pray for the rain of the rainy season to commence falling. If&nbsp;we still had to sit in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sukkah,</span><span class="font5"> we could not be expected to&nbsp;do this wholeheartedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;פר אחד, איל אחד</span><span class="font5">, “one bullock, one ram. G’d&nbsp;requested the minimum number of sacrifices from the Jewish&nbsp;people on that day, to show that He detained them only&nbsp;because of His fondness of them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,39. לעולותיכם</span><span class="font5">, “as your burnt offerings, etc.” for&nbsp;example the male sheep offered as such on Sabbath days&nbsp;when these occurred on Passover or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot.”</span><span class="font5"> [as at least&nbsp;one Sabbath had to fall on each of these festivals. Ed.]</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Mattot</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,2. אל ראשי המטות</span><span class="font5">, “to the leaders of the tribes;” It would be their task to enforce this law. An alternate&nbsp;interpretation by Ibn Ezra: this paragraph was revealed to the&nbsp;people after the punitive expedition against Midian, seeing&nbsp;that these verses are continuous until the end of verse three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> claims that the manner in which Moses ensured that the respective legislation reached the people was the&nbsp;same as in this instance, and he proves it from Exodus&nbsp;34,31-32 where the Torah wrote: 'וישובו אליו אהרן וגו, “and all&nbsp;of them returned to Moses, i.e. Aaron, the princes, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This particular verse was spoken by Moses when he had just descended from Mount Sinai on the Day of&nbsp;Atonement equipped with all the commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds here that the reason this formula has been used here by the Torah especially, is in order to teach that&nbsp;annulling vows can only be done by a judge authorised to do&nbsp;so, or in the absence of such by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">three</span><span class="font5"> laymen. This law has a&nbsp;unique feature in that a single judge, if an expert in that&nbsp;legislation is empowered to do so. The reference to the&nbsp;leaders of the tribes shows that such individuals possess&nbsp;special powers, whereas the words: “and to the Children of&nbsp;Israel,” mean that three laymen can accomplish the same as&nbsp;an expert without a colleague. This is stated in the Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nedarim</span><span class="font5"> folio 78, where Rav Acha says that the&nbsp;words: “Aaron, his sons, and the Children of Israel,” teach&nbsp;that an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ad hoc</span><span class="font5"> court of three laymen can perform this task. If&nbsp;so, why does the Torah stress that this legislation be&nbsp;revealed foremost to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">heads</span><span class="font5"> of the tribes, suggesting that&nbsp;these are people of superior knowledge? This suggests the&nbsp;opposite, i.e. that laymen are excluded!? Rabbi Chisda&nbsp;states that this is to teach that when an individual is indeed&nbsp;an expert in the legalese required, he can act independently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'זה הדבר אשר צוה ה</span><span class="font5">, “this is the matter that the Lord has commanded:” The Torah did not reveal where G’d&nbsp;commanded the following law to Moses. This is only one of&nbsp;numerous prophetic announcements by Moses where the&nbsp;time and location where Moses received these instructions&nbsp;has not been revealed. Examples quoted by our author are:&nbsp;Exodus 10,3, Exodus 11,4, Exodus 32,27 and his&nbsp;commentary there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,3. או השבע שבועה לאסור איסר</span><span class="font5">, “or swears an oath to declare something permitted to others as forbidden to&nbsp;himself;” what is the difference between making a “vow” and&nbsp;“swearing an oath,” seeing both place something out of&nbsp;bounds to the party making such a declaration?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When making a vow the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">object </span><span class="font5">of the vow is placed out of bounds to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">party </span><span class="font5">who makes such a vow, whereas&nbsp;when swearing an oath, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">party </span><span class="font5">swearing it places </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">himself&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">out of bounds to the object or people that are the subject of&nbsp;such an oath. Even though the Torah has not spelled this out&nbsp;specifically, we find hints that this is so in the wording used&nbsp;by the Torah to describe these two kinds of self imposed&nbsp;restrictions. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If someone says: “by the Life of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> and by your own life, I am not going to abandon you,” he is stating that&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> is alive, and that the party to whom he makes such&nbsp;a statement is alive. Using the name of the Lord as relevant&nbsp;to one’s own standing, is something which makes it such a&nbsp;severe sin if it turns out that one does not honour such a vow&nbsp;or oath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא יחל דברו</span><span class="font5">, “he must not delay fulfillment of his words indefinitely.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternately, he must not profane his own solemn undertaking by not honouring it.” We find this expression&nbsp;used in this sense in Psalms 130,7: 'יחל ישראל אל ה, “keep&nbsp;faithfully waiting, o Israel for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> fulfilling His&nbsp;undertakings” where the Psalmist has G’d urging Israel to&nbsp;wait patiently for G’d to honour His vows. G’d can be&nbsp;depended on to fulfill His vows or oaths. The party failing to&nbsp;fulfill his vow must not profane </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">himself </span><span class="font5">by doing so.&nbsp;However, others, i.e. a legal court have the power to release&nbsp;him from the obligations he imposed himself at a time of&nbsp;personal stress, not realising all the implications of what he&nbsp;had said at that time. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chagigah,</span><span class="font5"> folio 10).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,5. ושמע אביה</span><span class="font5">, “and her father has heard about it (the vow).” The Torah speaks only about when the father has&nbsp;heard about his daughter’s vow from her directly. What is the&nbsp;legal status if he heard about her vow only from others? This&nbsp;is why the Torah continues that “all her vows remain in&nbsp;force.” Even if he heard about it only indirectly, he can use&nbsp;his authority to annul it within 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;או מבטא שפתיה</span><span class="font5">, “or the utterance of her lips;” this&nbsp;does not refer to a casual few words, but is an alternate&nbsp;formula describing an oath, as we know from Leviticus 5,4: כי&nbsp;תשבע לבטא בשפתים, “or if one swears clearly with his lips etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמע אישה</span><span class="font5">, “and her husband hears about it;” here&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that the Torah implies that her husband had&nbsp;silently approved of his wife’s vow that it remains valid. [Our&nbsp;author appears to have had a different version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">commentary from that which appears in our editions. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30 16. ונשא את עונה, </span><span class="font5">“and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">will bear the burden of her guilt.” She was as if having acted under compulsion, as she&nbsp;was under the impression that her husband was able to&nbsp;cancel her vow even </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> he had known about it for more&nbsp;than 24 hours.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נקום נקמת</span><span class="font5">, “wreak vengeance!” the plain text&nbsp;appears to charge Moses personally with having to wreak&nbsp;this vengeance. However, seeing that he had been raised in&nbsp;Midian and had been saved from Pharaoh’s vengeance&nbsp;during all his years there, it would not have been moral for&nbsp;him to do this himself, just as he did not strike the river Nile&nbsp;during the plagues, as that river, i.e. its banks, had helped to&nbsp;save his life when he was an infant. He sent delegates as we&nbsp;read in verse 6, where the Torah quotes Moses as&nbsp;dispatching the 12000 soldiers to conduct the punitive&nbsp;campaign. [all righteous men who had not been involved in&nbsp;the shameful episode at Shittim, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לתת </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">נקמת</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> ה</span><span class="font5">י </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במדין, </span><span class="font5">“to execute the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Lord’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">vengeance against Midian. It is peculiar to read this, as G’d’s&nbsp;instructions had been to execute the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Children</span><span class="font5"> of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Israel’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">vengeance against Midian. (verse 2) What made Moses&nbsp;change the venue?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must imagine that Moses, upon hearing the instructions, had said to G’d: “the vengeance is really Yours&nbsp;o Lord, as the only reason why the Canaanites, Midianites,&nbsp;etc hate us, is on account of You.” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor).</span><span class="font5"> This is why&nbsp;the Israelites went to war against the Midianites, who were&nbsp;not part of the Moabites whose measure of guilt had not yet&nbsp;made them candidates for destruction by G’d. The Midianites&nbsp;had meddled in matters that did not concern them, and had&nbsp;no reason to fear the Israelites as their geographic location&nbsp;did not block Israel’s access to the Land of Canaan. The&nbsp;prophet Bileam had already stated that though he could&nbsp;foresee the complete collapse of Moav, he saw it as&nbsp;occurring in the distant future. [700-800 years later the&nbsp;Israelites were still involved in wars against Moav during the&nbsp;time of Elijah and Elisha. Ed.] At any rate, the Moabites had&nbsp;several reasons to fear the aggression of the Israelites so&nbsp;that they could be excused for acting in a hostile manner&nbsp;against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of their complaints was that the Israelites had actually conquered land that used to belong to Moav when&nbsp;they defeated King Sichon of the Canaanites, who&nbsp;conquered those lands previously from the Moabites. The&nbsp;Israelites had not returned it to Moav, but had settled it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לכל מטות ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “of each of the tribes of Israel.”&nbsp;This included even the tribe of Levi. (Compare both </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)</span><span class="font5"> Seeing that the Midianites had had evil intentions also&nbsp;against the tribe of Levi, there was no reason why that tribe&nbsp;should not participate in this punitive campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וימסרו מאלפי ישראל, </span><span class="font5">“there were ‘delivered’ from the&nbsp;thousands of Israelite men of military age, etc.” These men&nbsp;were not volunteers but conscripts as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has explained.&nbsp;G’d had told Moses to select these conscripts by means of&nbsp;lots. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Bamidbar Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 22,3.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,8. על חלליהם</span><span class="font5">, “with their other slain comrades;” the&nbsp;word על here means: “with,” as for instance in Leviticus&nbsp;25,31. (Compare what our author explains on that verse).&nbsp;Compare also על עולות התמיד in Numbers 28,15, as well as&nbsp;Exodus 35,20 האנשים על הנשים, “the men with the women,”&nbsp;and numerous other examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת בלעם, </span><span class="font5">“and Bileam;” after Bileam had returned from Moav to Aram Naharayim, his home base, he traveled to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Midian in order to collect a fee from the elders of Midian who had been in the first delegation Balak had sent to him to ask&nbsp;him to curse the Israelites. When he heard that a great&nbsp;plague had befallen the Israelites, he wanted to cash in on&nbsp;this, claiming that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">had been the instrument that brought&nbsp;this about, by having suggested that the Moabite women&nbsp;seduce their males into promiscuity by sleeping with their&nbsp;women. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation explaining Bileam’s sudden presence amongst the Midianites: when he had explained to&nbsp;the Moabites that the reason that he was unable to curse&nbsp;these people effectively was because they had been so loyal&nbsp;to their G’d and His Torah, (Numbers 23,21) the Moabites&nbsp;took the hint and succeeded to lead them into sin. Having&nbsp;succeeded in this, they sent Bileam another invitation&nbsp;stressing that now he could curse them effectively. He&nbsp;followed their advice and was killed as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,13. ויצאו משה ואלעזר הכהן</span><span class="font5">, “Moses and the High Priest Elazar went out to welcome back the soldiers (before they&nbsp;reached the camp);”they could not admit them to the camp&nbsp;because having killed human beings they had all become&nbsp;ritually impure and required seven days of purification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.16.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נקבה</span><span class="font5">, “any female;”(among the prisoners&nbsp;taken); this is not the only time when the word כל, does not&nbsp;mean: “each” or “all;” we have other examples such as in&nbsp;Exodus 20,10: לא תעשה כל מלאכה, ”do not perform any menial&nbsp;work;” or Exodus 22,21: כל אלמנה ויתום, “any widow or&nbsp;orphan.” There are quite a few more examples that could be&nbsp;cited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בדבר בלעם למסור מעל</span><span class="font5">, “to break faith (with G’d) through Bileam’s counsel;” he had taught these women how to lead&nbsp;the Israelites into grievous sin. (see verse 18 for details)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!וכל אשה יודעת איש למשכב זכר הרוגו</span><span class="font5">, “and kill any&nbsp;woman that has known a man by having carnal relations with&nbsp;him!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> questions why the Torah had to repeat the command: “kill” in this verse. He bases himself on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri,</span><span class="font5"> item&nbsp;157, where it is explained that without this repetition we</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">might have misunderstood due to the Torah also having stated that certain categories of females were allowed to live.&nbsp;In other words, we would not have known if to understand&nbsp;the word: כל as “each” or as “any.” The repetition makes it&nbsp;clear that the meaning is: “any.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation for why the word: הרוגו, “Kill!” had to be repeated at the end of this verse. If any woman old&nbsp;enough had to be killed even though she was still a virgin,&nbsp;surely a woman who had already experienced carnal&nbsp;relations would have had to be killed also! We have a rule&nbsp;that logic is not sufficient to allow us to apply a penalty to&nbsp;someone guilty of such. Therefore the Torah had to spell out&nbsp;that such women had to be killed, and we could not simply&nbsp;use our logic to act upon in such a case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to reason that the Torah could have avoided using this word at the beginning of the verse and&nbsp;written as follows: 'ועתה כל זכר וכל אשה יודעת איש וגו, “and&nbsp;therefore now, every male and every woman who has had&nbsp;carnal knowledge of a man, etc.,” the problem we would&nbsp;have had if the Torah had written this would be that we might&nbsp;have thought that as long as a minor male, not yet </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">capable&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">of indulging his libido, would not become liable to death until&nbsp;he had done so. We would have to deliberately present him&nbsp;with this opportunity in order to justify executing him and his&nbsp;partner. Considering all this, the Torah wrote: ועתה הרגו כל זכר&nbsp;בטף, “therefore kill now every male amongst the children,” i.e.&nbsp;immediately, without waiting, and kill every female if&nbsp;examination proves that she is no longer a virgin, seeing that&nbsp;this is proof that she had carnal knowledge of a male.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,18. </span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכל הטף בנשים אשר לא ידעו איש וגו, </span><span class="font5">“but any&nbsp;children among the women who have not had carnal&nbsp;knowledge, etc.” you shall let live for your benefit. This&nbsp;formulation prompted Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai to state that&nbsp;a female convert who has not attained the age of three years&nbsp;and a day, is fit to marry a priest. [as she could not have&nbsp;been contaminated through carnal intercourse] </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri</span><span class="font5"> on this&nbsp;verse)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,19. ואתם חנו חוץ למחנה</span><span class="font5">, “as for you, meanwhile make camp outside the camp of the Israelites;” even though&nbsp;someone contaminated through contact with a corpse is not&nbsp;even permitted to stay within the camp of the ordinary&nbsp;Israelites but even in the area allocated to the Levites, these&nbsp;soldiers did not want to avail themselves of this rule. They&nbsp;were afraid that through physical contact they might cause&nbsp;other people to become ritually impure. There were so many&nbsp;people in the camp that they were unable to not inadvertently&nbsp;touch some of them. As their ritual status was the one called&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">av hatumah,</span><span class="font5"> primary source of ritual impurity, this meant that&nbsp;people or vessels touching them would immediately contract&nbsp;a secondary level of impurity at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תתחטאו</span><span class="font5">, “become purified!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that the means of purification was the same as if they had become&nbsp;contaminated by contact with a Jewish corpse, although&nbsp;there are opinions that a gentile corpse does not confer ritual&nbsp;impurity on a Jew. This opinion refers only to impurity&nbsp;conferred by being in the same covered airspace with the&nbsp;corpse. All authorities agree that physical contact with the&nbsp;corpse of a gentile does confer ritual impurity on that Jew.&nbsp;The disagreement revolves around the word אדם, whether it&nbsp;could be applied to gentiles. (Compare Ezekiel 34,31) The&nbsp;situations in which this type of ritual impurity occurs are&nbsp;spelled out in Numbers 19,16 as being: “physical contact with&nbsp;someone slain by the sword, death by natural causes, or&nbsp;contact with a grave or human bone,” as requiring a&nbsp;purification period of seven consecutive days. Seeing that&nbsp;this verse does not mention being in the same tent as the&nbsp;dead body or limb, as did verse 14 there, the fact that&nbsp;separate verses are used, supports the opinion that verse 16&nbsp;applies also to gentile corpses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ביום השלישי וביום השביעי </span><span class="font5">“on the third day and the seventh day;” The Torah here stresses the ritual to be&nbsp;performed while purifying themselves when unclean due to&nbsp;having killed Midianites, although it did not do so when the&nbsp;Israelite soldiers killed the members of the Canaanite nations&nbsp;during the war of conquest under the leadership of Joshua.&nbsp;The reason is that only 12000 soldiers were involved in the&nbsp;campaign against the Midianites, whereas the entire male&nbsp;population was involved in the war of conquest, and we know&nbsp;from the Talmud that when the majority of the people are in a&nbsp;state of ritual uncleanness due to contact with corpses, the&nbsp;restrictions applying to people in such a condition are&nbsp;waived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During wartime even the most repugnant gentile foods etc., are permitted to be eaten by the soldiers when this&nbsp;ensures that they have sufficient nourishment. The same&nbsp;was true even for the civilian population immediately after the&nbsp;conquest of the land of Canaan, as the Torah refers to the&nbsp;people having been given “houses fully stocked with the&nbsp;necessities of life,” i.e. unless they were allowed to use them,&nbsp;why would the Torah describe them as a “gift” from G’d?&nbsp;(Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 17, based on Deuteronomy&nbsp;6,11.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In contrast to the wars of conquest in Canaan, the 12000 soldiers conducting the punitive expedition against&nbsp;Midian, campaign which was primarily a religious war, were&nbsp;not allowed to take advantage of what would be permitted&nbsp;during the wars of conquest for the whole nation. They&nbsp;remained bound by all the laws governing personal purity,&nbsp;and this is why they had to undergo the purification rites on&nbsp;the third and seventh day as indicated here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that they did not sustain a single casualty during that campaign is evidence of the different nature of&nbsp;that campaign. Moreover, the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">cause</span><span class="font5"> of the campaign had&nbsp;been the fact that meant thousands of Israelites had&nbsp;contaminated themselves spiritually, by worshipping the Baal&nbsp;Peor. (Numbers 25,3). The soldiers from the punitive&nbsp;campaign undergoing a purification ritual therefore also had&nbsp;a symbolic significance, seeing that not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font5"> soldier may&nbsp;have been involved in killing a Midianite. Therefore, even if&nbsp;there was only a doubt about their having touched a&nbsp;Midianite corpse, the Torah decreed the purification process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.20.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וכל בגד, “and any garment;” as that garment&nbsp;might have touched a Midianite corpse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר אלעזר הכהן</span><span class="font5">, “the High Priest Elazar said:”&nbsp;the reason that it was Elazar who issued the instructions&nbsp;following concerning how to purify the loot, was that it had&nbsp;been he who had prepared the first red heifer whose ashes&nbsp;would be the instrument that made the purification process&nbsp;possible. (Numbers 19,3) Although Moses had instructed him&nbsp;in these procedures, of course, and Elazar had quoted him,&nbsp;he was punished for preempting Moses in revealing what the&nbsp;procedures were to be taken now. The punishment was that&nbsp;we do not find that Joshua again required the services of the&nbsp;High Priest Elazar, although when he had been appointed&nbsp;the Torah had written that “he will stand before Elazar the&nbsp;High Priest,” (Numbers 26,21) suggesting that the latter&nbsp;outranked Joshua. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eyruvin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 63)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זאת חקת התורה, </span><span class="font5">“this is the statute of the Torah;” he referred to what Moses had told him in verse 19, that anyone&nbsp;who had killed someone had to undergo the purification rites.&nbsp;The details had all been spelled out in Numbers chapter 19&nbsp;commencing with verse 13 when the details of the red heifer&nbsp;are discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,23. ,וטהר, אך במי נדה יתחטא</span><span class="font5">. “it will become pure, but must still be purified further with the water of sprinkling,&nbsp;called: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mey niddah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rabba bar Avuhi</span><span class="font5"> in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avodah Zarah </span><span class="font5">folio 75, states that the language of the Torah does not only&nbsp;refer to used utensils, if they had not been used for 12&nbsp;months, but even for new vessels not produced by Jews if&nbsp;these are meant to be used in the consumption of food or&nbsp;preparation of food. The manner of purifying same is less&nbsp;demanding than the purification of human beings who had&nbsp;been in contact with dead bodies or body parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Rabbi Yirmiyah heard of the statement of Rabbi </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rabbah,</span><span class="font5"> he added that his rule applies only to vessels that&nbsp;have been acquired (purchased or looted) and had been&nbsp;handled by Israelites. If they had only been borrowed&nbsp;temporarily they do not require such purification. Vessels that&nbsp;are made of earthenware cannot be purified unless first&nbsp;broken up when they can be reconstituted by having the&nbsp;shards put in a kiln after treatment by the artisan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mar bar rav Ashi, is on record as telling people that his father was in the habit of using vessels made from silver that&nbsp;he had received from gentiles as security of loans extended&nbsp;to them. He drank from these vessels (after immersing them&nbsp;in a ritual bath only without submitting them to further&nbsp;purification first). His son was not sure if he did so because&nbsp;he considered them as on loan to him. Or, these vessels&nbsp;were not used to contain matters which had been heated&nbsp;first, such as soup, etc, in which case they would have&nbsp;required a higher degree of purification. (boiling water being&nbsp;poured over them, or if they were small enough, immersing&nbsp;them in boiling water. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> Mar bar Rav Ashi’s&nbsp;father was convinced that the borrower who had left this&nbsp;silver vessel with him as security would never demand it&nbsp;back and repay the loan, so that he considered it as his, else&nbsp;he would not have been allowed it as it was given to him for&nbsp;safekeeping. In effect, he had bought it and his payment had&nbsp;been the money he “loaned” to the previous owner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,24. </span><span class="font5">וכבסתם בגדיכם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">and you have to wash your&nbsp;garments.” It goes without saying that you also have to wash&nbsp;your bodies. We have another example of a similar&nbsp;construction in Exodus 19,10 when the Jewish people are&nbsp;instructed by Moses in the name of the Lord to wash their&nbsp;garments, וכבסו שמלותם, as part of sanctifying themselves in&nbsp;advance of the revelation at Mount Sinai. Another example of&nbsp;this is found in Numbers 19,10, where the man handling the&nbsp;procedure involving the red heifer is required to wash his&nbsp;garments. [“Washing” in all of these instances is not what we&nbsp;call “laundering,” but is a reference for immersion in a ritual&nbsp;bath. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,28. מאת אנשי המלחמה, אחד נפש מחמש המאות</span><span class="font5">, “one item&nbsp;in each five hundred, be it a person or chattel or animal.”&nbsp;Seeing that the warriors had born the brunt of the burden of&nbsp;this campaign, their “tithe” for the Lord is relatively much&nbsp;smaller in terms of the percentage they must give to the&nbsp;Temple treasury. It would be handed over to the High Priest&nbsp;Elazar. (verse 29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,30. אחד אחוז מן החמשים ונתתה אותם ללוים</span><span class="font5">, (from the&nbsp;half share of the other Israelites) “you shall withhold one in&nbsp;every fifty (humans, cattle, and chattels) and give them to the&nbsp;Levites.” When the Levites received 10 shares out of every&nbsp;thousand, the priests took for themselves one share. [Rabbi&nbsp;Chavell points out that our author appears to have made a&nbsp;miscalculation here. I will not get involved in this. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן הבקר ומן החמורים ומן הצאן</span><span class="font5">, “from the herds, the donkeys and the flocks.” Why were the camels not&nbsp;mentioned, seeing that there must have been very many of&nbsp;them? In the war against Midian under Gideon (Judges 6,51)&nbsp;the author tells us that the number of camels captured were&nbsp;too many to bother counting. Apparently, only these animals&nbsp;were counted as qualifying for the Temple treasury which&nbsp;were ritually pure, or which the Torah had accorded a special&nbsp;status such as donkeys, whose first born males had to be&nbsp;redeemed. (Exodus chapter 13,15) We may assume that the&nbsp;camels were included in when the Torah wrote: ממל הבהמה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">from all of the livestock in our verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,32. יתר הבז</span><span class="font5">, “the excess of the loot;” this refers to what the soldiers had consumed prior to returning to camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.49. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא נפקד ממנו איש</span><span class="font5">, “and not one of us who had&nbsp;been counted is unaccounted for.” The remarkable thing here&nbsp;was that we have a rule that a headcount is liable to result in&nbsp;a plague, and that there is no remedy against this. Our sages&nbsp;therefore do not understand the word נפקד here in the&nbsp;conventional sense, but they translate it to mean that none of&nbsp;the 12000 soldiers in this campaign had become guilty of a&nbsp;personal sin, which might have resulted in Satan having an&nbsp;excuse to kill him. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 64)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.50. ונקרב את קרבן ה', לכפר על נפשותינו</span><span class="font5">, ”we have brought</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">the Lord’s offering......to make atonement for our souls.” We</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">had made this commitment already before having been counted in order to protect us against the potential harm that&nbsp;might befall us on account of the count. This is why we have&nbsp;now brought it to the Tabernacle. We find confirmation for&nbsp;this interpretation in Exodus 30,16: ולקחת את כסף הכפויים ונתת&nbsp;אותו על עבודת אהל מועד, “and you shall take (accept) the&nbsp;atonement money from the Children of Israel and shall&nbsp;appoint it for the service of the Tent of Meeting;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'ונקרב את קרבן ה</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> adds that they meant that even if they had withstood the temptation to commit a sin, they had&nbsp;not been free from the temptation to do so, and they meant&nbsp;to atone for this by this offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to counter that the Torah had actually condoned sleeping with prisoners of war due to giving in to&nbsp;their physical allure, (Deuteronomy chapter 21) so what sin&nbsp;or temptation to sin did these soldiers talk about? We would&nbsp;have to refer to the Jerusalem Talmud who states that&nbsp;chapter 21 in Deuteronomy only condone until the conquest&nbsp;has been completed, not after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,51. כל כלי מעשה</span><span class="font5">, “even jewelry that had been made from such gold.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,2. ויבאו בני גד</span><span class="font5">, “The members of tribe of Gad etc. came; the reason why the members of the tribe of Gad were&nbsp;mentioned ahead of the tribe of Reuven, the senior tribe of&nbsp;their army group, is that it was they who had come up with&nbsp;the idea of remaining on the east bank of the Jordan&nbsp;permanently. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,7. ?ולמה תנואון</span><span class="font5">, “and to what purpose do you want to&nbsp;turn away (the hearts)?” This word is read as we spelled it,&nbsp;but is spelled as a transitive word, the letter י appearing in&nbsp;the text instead of the letter ו, before the last letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,12. בלתי כלב בן יפונה</span><span class="font5">, ”except for Calev, son of Y’funeh.” If you were to say that also Yair, son of Menashe&nbsp;entered the Holy Land (crossed the Jordan) and was killed&nbsp;during the siege on Ai, together with 35 comrades in arms&nbsp;(Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 44) (according to Joshua&nbsp;7,8) we have to answer that the decree concerning who&nbsp;would not be allowed to enter the Holy Land did not apply to&nbsp;people under the age of twenty at the time it was decreed,&nbsp;nor did it apply to people over the age of fifty, as neither&nbsp;category would have been drafted into military service, so&nbsp;that the spies’ refusal to undertake a campaign against the&nbsp;Canaanites would not have affected them personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,15. להניחו</span><span class="font5">, “he will again leave you;” the letter ח in&nbsp;this word was exchanged from the original letter ע; we have&nbsp;proof of this in verse 13 in the word ויניעם, “He made them&nbsp;wander.” The word להניחו in this verse means that failure of&nbsp;the tribes of Reuven and Gad to reconsider will extend the&nbsp;length of their whole generation in exile in the desert, which&nbsp;includes constantly having to move. If the two tribes were to&nbsp;decline to settle in the west bank, history would likely repeat&nbsp;itself, and another generation would not get to see the&nbsp;promised Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are commentators who understand the word להניחו, as “to abandon it;” this would be analogous to Psalms&nbsp;119,121: בל תניחני לעושקי, “do not abandon me to those who&nbsp;would wrong me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,17. ואנחנו חלץ חושים</span><span class="font5">, “we will be ready armed to act as vanguard;” These tribes promised, after first having&nbsp;settled their families and livestock, not only to fight along the&nbsp;other tribes but to do so in the most exposed positions. They&nbsp;would be able to do so, precisely because they would not be&nbsp;encumbered by their families and livestock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לפני בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, they would lead the fight on behalf of the people just as they also had taken the lead in settling their&nbsp;families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,27. כל חלוץ צבא</span><span class="font5">, “every man that is armed for war.”&nbsp;Apparently, the author’s version of the text had the vowel&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz</span><span class="font5"> under the letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ח </span><span class="font5">instead of the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach.</span><span class="font5"> His&nbsp;commentary presupposes this. As in our editions we have&nbsp;the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chataf patach,</span><span class="font5"> we need not bother copying his&nbsp;commentary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,33. ולחצי שבט מנשה</span><span class="font5">, “and as far has half of the tribe Menashe is concerned, etc.” they had not requested to be&nbsp;given their ancestral heritage in the lands previously owned&nbsp;by Sichon and Og; but seeing it was their founding father,&nbsp;Joseph’s first born son who had searched the sacks of&nbsp;Joseph who had caused them to tear up their garments when&nbsp;he accused one of the brothers as having stolen his father’s&nbsp;goblet, they were given as compensation two sections of&nbsp;land on the east bank of the Jordan. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’reshit Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 84,20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,38. מוסבות שם</span><span class="font5">, “their names being changed;” originally they had been known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ammon</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Moav;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">subsequently they became known as Sichon </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font5"> Og.</span></p>

Seeing that at that time Machir was already&nbsp;aged, having been too old to be part of the army, he gave&nbsp;him a fortified city. He remained there during the 14 years&nbsp;that the two and a half tribes were engaged in fighting with&nbsp;the tribes who would settle on the West Bank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,41 ויאיר בן מנשה</span><span class="font5">, “meanwhile Yair, son of Menashe,” he was called after his mother, even though he was from the&nbsp;tribe of Yehudah (Ibn Ezra), as it is written that Chetzron. son&nbsp;of Yehudah married a daughter of Machir and sired Seguv&nbsp;from that marriage. Seguv in turn sired Yair, and they owned&nbsp;cities in Gilead. (Compare Chronicles I 2,21) We find a&nbsp;similar situation in Ezra 2,61 where priests were named after&nbsp;Barzilai the Giladi, who was not a priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We cannot offer an excuse for how it came about that one tribe acquired part of another tribe’s ancestral heritage.&nbsp;We can only surmise that the rules of intermarriage between&nbsp;members of tribes did not apply as strictly in the lands&nbsp;conquered on the East Bank of the Jordan, formerly&nbsp;belonging to the tribe of the Emorites, as it did to the land&nbsp;west of the river Jordan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקרא אתהן חוות יאיר</span><span class="font5">, “and he named them;” ‘the villages of Yair.’ This was to commemorate Yair who had been killed&nbsp;in the battles for Ai. (verse 7) It is recorded here as it took&nbsp;place before the bulk of the country had been conquered,&nbsp;and was testimony to the bravery of Yair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,42. ונובח</span><span class="font5">, and Novach, one of the sons of Menashe (not substantiated)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויקרא לה, </span><span class="font5">“he named it,” he (Novach) renamed K’nath. The word נבח is spelled “weak,” the letter ב not having a dot&nbsp;in it. This suggests that the renaming was temporary, and&nbsp;lasted only until the members of his tribe returned from&nbsp;helping the other tribes conquer the land on the West Bank&nbsp;(14 years). It had to be named so, so that in the interval no&nbsp;one could stake a claim to this land and take it away from its&nbsp;rightful owner who was an absentee. This is what </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explains here, quoting Rabbi Moshe </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hadarshan.</span><span class="font5"> He wonders&nbsp;how Rabbi Moshe </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hadarshan</span><span class="font5"> can explain this phenomenon&nbsp;in 2 similar situations in Ruth 2,14 and Zecharyah 5,11.where&nbsp;the words בית and בעז also have no dot in the letter ב.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are some commentators who try to explain the absence of the dots in the 2 examples I just mentioned. Their&nbsp;reasoning is brilliant, but I decided that it is not relevant to us&nbsp;here as texts composed by authors of the books of prophets&nbsp;or Scriptures need not be examined as carefully as those in&nbsp;the Torah. Here we must assume that the sages responsible&nbsp;for the vocalisation in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Torah, </span><span class="font5">had been inspired with Holy&nbsp;Spirit when they performed their task.</span></p>

What this means here in practical terms is&nbsp;that only the journeys listed from here on in, but not עטרות&nbsp;and דבון, of which the Torah wrote in Numbers 32,3 and the&nbsp;locations mentioned there, are included in what follows.</span></p>

If we needed proof for this, we only have to look at&nbsp;Leviticus 23,8 and Numbers 28,16. The remainder of that&nbsp;festival is always referred to as חג המצות, “the festival of&nbsp;unleavened breads.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">33.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויסעו...מרעמסס ויחנו בסוכות</span><span class="font5">. Our author refers the&nbsp;reader to his commentary on Exodus 12,37.</span></p>

This is&nbsp;alluded to in Exodus 15,22 where they began a march&nbsp;toward an uncertain future in the desert of Shur, one of the&nbsp;deserts described elsewhere as ”this great and terrifying&nbsp;desert.” (Deuteronomy 8,15)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,19. ויסעו מרתמה</span><span class="font5">, “they journeyed from Ritmah;” this is&nbsp;the place of which the Torah wrote in Numbers 14,25:&nbsp;“tomorrow you will turn around and start traveling towards the&nbsp;sea of reeds.” This is what the Torah referred to when it&nbsp;wrote in Deut. 2,1: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונפן ונסע דרך ים סוף</span><span class="font5">, “we turned around and&nbsp;journeyed in the direction of the sea of reeds.” From that&nbsp;point on they were detouring Mount Seir during all the way&nbsp;stations mentioned up until verse 36 of this chapter, where&nbsp;they were reported to have entered the desert of Tzin at&nbsp;Kadesh. Compare Numbers 20,1: “the entire congregation of&nbsp;the Children of Israel arrived at the desert of Tzin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,35. </span><span class="font5">the Jerusalem Targum renders this place as&nbsp;meaning: בכרך תרנגולא, “at a place where one could hear the&nbsp;roosters.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,41. ויחנו בצלמונה</span><span class="font5">, “they encamped at Tzalmonah.” Both this way station as well as ויחנו בפונון, have not been&nbsp;mentioned by these names in the portion of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chukat</span><span class="font5"> in&nbsp;chapter 21,10, but as Ovot, as this was a turning point in&nbsp;their south easterly route, from which they turned northward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.45. ויסעו מעיים ויחנו בדיבון גד</span><span class="font5">, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat</span><span class="font5"> Chukat this location is referred to as 21,12) .נחל זרד)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.46. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסעו מדיבון גד ויחנו בעלמון דבלתימה</span><span class="font5">, this location&nbsp;has been referred to in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Chukat,</span><span class="font5"> Numbers 21,13&nbsp;“from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ever Arnon</span><span class="font5"> which is in the desert.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.47. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסעו מעלמון דבלתימה ויחנו בהר העברים</span><span class="font5">, “they&nbsp;journeyed on from Almon Divlataymah and encamped&nbsp;around the Mountains of Avarim. In Numbers 31,19 this&nbsp;journey had been described as commencing from the desert&nbsp;called Matanah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.48. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסעו מהרי העברים ויחנו בערבות מואב</span><span class="font5">, “they&nbsp;journeyed from the mountains of Avarim and encamped in&nbsp;the plains of Moav. This journey had been referred to in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Chukat</span><span class="font5"> as: “from Matanah to Nachliel.” (verse 19).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once the people had come to this location, they gradually spread out in different directions on that plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,55.</span><span class="font5">לשכים בעיניכם, “as thorns in your eyes.” This expression also appears in this sense in Proverbs 15,19:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">כמשוכת</span><span class="font5"> חדק, “like thorns in a hedge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולצנינים</span><span class="font5">, “and as pricks;” Compare Proverbs 22,5, צנים</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">פחים.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,2. אל הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “to the land;” this verse appears in a&nbsp;truncated mode, and according to the rules of grammar it&nbsp;should have been written as: אל הארץ, ארץ כנען, “to the land,”&nbsp;i.e. the land of Canaan. We encounter similar such&nbsp;abbreviations in Numbers 25,12: את בריתי שלום when&nbsp;according to the rules of grammar, it should have been: את&nbsp;בריתי, ברית השלום.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,4. 'ועבר צנה והיה תוצאותיו וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and once having passed Tzinah, it will extend southward, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מנגב לקדש ברנע</span><span class="font5">, from the south to Kadesh Barnea. There were two places called “Kadesh.” One was located in the&nbsp;land of Canaan, and was mentioned in the Book of Joshua&nbsp;15,3 as one of the towns in that land. The second one is the&nbsp;one first mentioned in the portion of Mattot, 32,8: בשלחי אתכם&nbsp;מקדש ברנע, “when I sent them, (your fathers) on a mission&nbsp;from Kadesh Barnea,” Moses speaking about the ill fated trip&nbsp;of the spies throughout the land of Canaan some 38 years&nbsp;earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is quite impossible to suppose that Moses dispatched the spies from a town inside the land of Canaan. If he had&nbsp;done so, he would have first have to cross into that land,&nbsp;something that not only G’d had forbidden him, but&nbsp;something that he greatly regretted not having been able to&nbsp;do as we know from his own mouth. The “Kadesh” without an&nbsp;adjective, was situated near the border of the land of Edom&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויצא חצר אדר</span><span class="font5">, “and it shall go forth to Chatzar adar”; here&nbsp;the impression is given that it was a single district; on the&nbsp;other hand, in Joshua 15,3, “chatzar and passed adera,” it&nbsp;seems that these were two separate districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,11. ים כנרת</span><span class="font5">, “the sea of Galilee;” this is a lake whose&nbsp;waters do not run off into another larger sea or ocean. It is&nbsp;completely surrounded on all banks by Jewish settlements.&nbsp;Its waters descend to the Dead Sea, where they become&nbsp;unfit to drink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,19. למטה יהודה</span><span class="font5">, of the tribe of Yehudah. Moses began&nbsp;enumerating the family heads which would start the process&nbsp;of allocating ancestral tracts of land with the members of the&nbsp;tribe of Yehudah, as his name came up first when the lots&nbsp;were drawn. In this instance, Calev would be the head of the&nbsp;tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;למטה בנימין</span><span class="font5">, “of the tribe of Binyamin;” here&nbsp;Binyamin is listed as if the third of the tribes, seeing that&nbsp;these three tribes in the future would cede of their ancestral&nbsp;lands to the Levites all at once, as recorded in the Book of&nbsp;Joshua: 21,4: ויהי לבני אהרן הכהן מן הלוים, ממאה יהודה, וממטה&nbsp;שמעון וממטה בנימין בגורל ערים שלש עשר, “to the descendants of&nbsp;Aaron the priest, there fell by lot 13 towns from the tribe of&nbsp;Yehudah, the tribe of Shimon, and the tribe of Binyamin.”&nbsp;This is why they were lumped together by Moses already at&nbsp;this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולמטה בני דן נשיא</span><span class="font5">, “and of the tribe of Dan, a&nbsp;prince;” the reason that the word: “prince” has not been&nbsp;mentioned with the first three tribes listed here, is because&nbsp;we knew already that Calev of the tribe of Yehudah, as the&nbsp;only survivor of his tribe that had been an adult at the Exodus&nbsp;would be the leader after Nachshon had died. He had&nbsp;already been called by G’d Himself as “My servant.”&nbsp;(Numbers 14,24) As far as the tribe of Binyamin is&nbsp;concerned, we know that Eldod, a colleague of Meydod, both&nbsp;from this tribe had been elevated to the status of prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to another interpretation, seeing that at a later stage involving the concubine a Givah, (Judges chapter&nbsp;20) he would be dishonorably involved, he is not here&nbsp;referred to as a prince. The same consideration applies to&nbsp;the tribe of Shimon, whose prince in short order will be&nbsp;involved in the shameful episode with the Midianite woman&nbsp;Cosbi, Moses did not bestow the title prince upon him&nbsp;posthumously. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> had pointed out already in his&nbsp;commentary on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat</span><span class="font5"> Balak, that the people of the tribe of&nbsp;Shimon had treated Zimri as their leader. (Numbers 25,6)&nbsp;There had been no need for a leader of the tribes of Reuven&nbsp;and Gad to be appointed, as these tribes had already&nbsp;received their ancestral heritage on the east bank of the&nbsp;Jordan. Our author thus has explained why the names of the&nbsp;tribes here neither appeared in the order of their founders’&nbsp;birth, or their respective mothers, i.e. Leah, Rachel, Zilpah&nbsp;and Bilhah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ערים לשבת</span><span class="font5">, “cities to dwell in;” while the Levites&nbsp;were not given ancestral lands, at least they were given&nbsp;houses, i.e. some real estate where to make their permanent&nbsp;homes. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">35.3.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולכל חיתם</span><span class="font5">, “and for all their livestock.” The choice&nbsp;by the Torah of the word: חיה for livestock, instead of בהמה, is&nbsp;to underline that the Levites’ function on earth is to promote&nbsp;constructive life not burial rites, as pointed out by our sages&nbsp;in the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Makkot</span><span class="font5"> folio12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,6. ועליהם תתנו ארבעים ושתים עיר</span><span class="font5">, “and in addition you will add 42 towns” (which can also serve as cities of refuge).&nbsp;The difference between the six cities of refuge named and&nbsp;the cities of the Levites is that the former serve as such&nbsp;regardless of if the unintentional killer is aware of their&nbsp;function or not, whereas the 42 cities of the Levites serve as&nbsp;such only if specifically chosen by the unintentional killer for&nbsp;that purpose. Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Makkot,</span><span class="font5"> folio 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,12. למקלט מגואל</span><span class="font5">, “as refuge from the potential avenger of the slain person.” They are to calm the fears of&nbsp;the person who killed unintentionally who worries about&nbsp;becoming the victim of such relatives of the slain person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא ימות הרוצח</span><span class="font5">, “so that the manslayer will not have to die.” The Torah had to stress this, seeing that it had written in&nbsp;verse 27 of this chapter: ורצח גואל הדם את הרוצח</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“and the&nbsp;avenger of blood will slay the manslayer.” This taught that if&nbsp;these two meet elsewhere, the avenger would not be&nbsp;culpable for having killed unless the manslayer had stood&nbsp;trial and been convicted of murder. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,14. את שלש הערים</span><span class="font5">, “the three cities;” we do not read here about the difference of the status of these cities that&nbsp;Moses had selected on the east bank of the Jordan and the&nbsp;three that were designated as cities of refuge on the west&nbsp;bank. (the word מקלט describing the function of the three&nbsp;cities on the east bank is absent in this verse. Ed.] This had&nbsp;been spelled out, however, in Deuteronomy 4,41-43. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explains that a) the three cities which Moses had designated&nbsp;on the east bank did not become functional as long as the&nbsp;land on the west bank had not been conquered and settled.&nbsp;b) He also points out on our verse that whereas three such&nbsp;cities served in the west bank where nine and a half tribes&nbsp;had made their homes were on the east bank where only two&nbsp;and a half tribes had made their homes were served by the&nbsp;same number of cities of refuge. He views this as proof that&nbsp;Moses viewed the likelihood of these cities being needed on&nbsp;the east bank was far greater as in Gilead murders would be&nbsp;more common than in the “Holy Land” on the west bank. He&nbsp;backs up this surmise by quoting Hosea 6,8: גלעד קרית פועלי&nbsp;און עקובה מדם, “Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked up with&nbsp;blood.” This suggests that in the prophet’s time even&nbsp;intentional killers were in the habit of using these cities as&nbsp;cities of refuge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Makkot</span><span class="font5"> folio 9, states that in the early periods both intentional and unintentional killers used to flee&nbsp;to the cities of refuge, pending a trial to determine who had&nbsp;been an intentional killer and who had been an unintentional&nbsp;killer. This explains what the Torah had written in verse 12&nbsp;that no one was to be executed until he had stood trial.&nbsp;According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri,</span><span class="font5"> the courts would dispatch messengers to&nbsp;bring the offending parties to trial in the location under their&nbsp;jurisdiction, i.e. depending on where the killing had occurred.&nbsp;They would execute the guilty and free the innocent, i.e.&nbsp;bring them back to the city of refuge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,16. ואם בכלי ברזל הכהו</span><span class="font5">, “but if he struck him with a metal instrument or tool;” why did the Torah have to give us&nbsp;this example if it had already told us that wooden or stone&nbsp;vessels or tools are considered as lethal weapons? Surely it&nbsp;is understood that metal tools are at least as dangerous?!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is to teach us that penalties cannot be imposed on the basis of logic, especially in capital crimes, but only if the&nbsp;written Torah had decreed them. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> quoting&nbsp;the Talmud in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> and by the commentaries.) A&nbsp;minute metal instrument, a needle is already capable of&nbsp;causing death, i.e. is a lethal weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,20. ואם בשנאה יהדפנו, </span><span class="font5">“and if he had attacked him from above out of a feeling of hatred,” [possibly without intent&nbsp;to kill but only to harm, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,23. “</span><span class="font5">and he threw it </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">down</span><span class="font5"> upon him;” from the&nbsp;wording of this verse the Rabbis concluded that killing by&nbsp;dropping something on the victim makes the killer subject to&nbsp;spending the rest of his life until the death of the High Priest&nbsp;in a city of refuge. If the killer had looked at what was below&nbsp;him he would have seen that dropping an object or throwing&nbsp;an object down was something dangerous. (Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Makkot</span><span class="font5"> folio 7) On the other hand, if the victim was struck by&nbsp;the killer having thrown something up into the air, this is&nbsp;considered an accident, and the person who had thrown the&nbsp;object does not have to be confined to the city of refuge. The&nbsp;basic principle is that one has to look in front if there are&nbsp;obstacles, but not behind or above. Normal people do not&nbsp;look in all directions before throwing an object.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.25. וישב בה עד מות הכהן הגדול</span><span class="font5">, “and he has to dwell there until the death of the High Priest.” The reason is so that&nbsp;people at large will not accuse the High Priest as not having&nbsp;fulfilled his task of seeing to it that murder does not go&nbsp;unpunished (Deuteronomy 17,12). They would not be able to&nbsp;blame the new high Priest as the killing had not occurred&nbsp;while he was in office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את גבול עיר מקלטו</span><span class="font5">, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">beyond</span><span class="font5"> the boundary of his&nbsp;city of refuge;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,28. 'אחרי מות הכהן הגדול ישוב הרוצח וגו</span><span class="font5">, ”after the death&nbsp;of the High Priest, the “murderer” will return” (home). All the&nbsp;cities of the Levites are under the direct authority of the High&nbsp;Priest. It is an undisputed law that that such unintentional&nbsp;“murderers” go free at the death of the High Priest. Our&nbsp;sages have a saying that “death brings in its wake&nbsp;atonement.” (Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Makkot</span><span class="font5"> folio 11), where it is clear that&nbsp;the “death” referred to is that of the High Priest. We find&nbsp;something analogous in Isaiah 14,17: אסיריו לא פתח ביתה,&nbsp;“who never released its prisoners?” [The prophet decries&nbsp;such a cruel practice. Jewish law which basically does not&nbsp;provide for prison as a form of punishment, certainly would&nbsp;not countenance life-imprisonment. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועד אחד לא יענה בנפש</span><span class="font5">, “a solitary witness must not&nbsp;testify against a person (in a capital case).” We might have&nbsp;thought that seeing that the penalty for capital crimes is so&nbsp;severe that the testimony of a single witness is relevant. The&nbsp;Torah tells us that it is not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא תקחו כופר לנפש רוצח</span><span class="font5">, “you must not accept a&nbsp;financial ransom in lieu of the life of the murderer.” Seeing&nbsp;that in almost all situations the Torah is willing to accept&nbsp;punishment in the form of money or its equivalent, why does&nbsp;the Torah not accept it as atonement for a life taken? Life, as&nbsp;opposed to limbs, is something that cannot be valued in&nbsp;terms of money, in terms of material things. The only&nbsp;instance in which financial atonement (partial at best) is&nbsp;acceptable is when the penalty for the sin committed is death&nbsp;at the hands of heaven, but not by a human tribunal. This is&nbsp;why the Torah added: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אם כופר יושת עליו</span><span class="font5">, (Exodus 21,30) “if&nbsp;payment of a ransom had been imposed upon the guilty&nbsp;party.” This type of punishment is not really a full&nbsp;compensation, but since G’d has reserved to mete out His&nbsp;own judgment, it will fill the bill in the meantime. [You will not&nbsp;find that a person convicted of theft </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font5"> murder will be&nbsp;assessed the financial penalty, as the loss of his life is the&nbsp;ultimate penalty, and the Torah does not impose anything&nbsp;beyond that. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">35,33. ולא </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">תחניפו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> את הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “this verse is to be understood at face value, i.e. “you shall not flatter the land;” this is a&nbsp;warning for wealthy people who had become guilty of the&nbsp;death penalty not to be allowed to plead to a lesser charge,&nbsp;and to make generous financial restitution to the party whom&nbsp;they had harmed or to the family of that person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'כי הדם הוא הוא </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">יחניף</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> וגו</span><span class="font5">, “for the blood spilled (and not atoned for) would </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">contaminate”</span><span class="font5"> the soil of the Holy Land.&nbsp;This is why G’d warns us not to contaminate the land he has&nbsp;given us by allowing bloodshed to go unpunished according&nbsp;to the principle of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נפש תחת נפש</span><span class="font5">, “a life for a life,” a principle&nbsp;spelled out already in Genesis 9,6, a principle applicable to&nbsp;all of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולארץ לא יכופר</span><span class="font5">, “and no expiation can be made for the land;” the Torah, of course, refers to the inhabitants of the&nbsp;land even more so, [seeing that the earth had been&nbsp;completely passive. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,1. ויקרבו ראשי האבות</span><span class="font5">, “the heads of the father’s houses approached, etc.” the reason that this paragraph is&nbsp;appended here is that Moses had recently issued instructions&nbsp;about how the land is to be distributed and according to what&nbsp;criteria, especially the status of the cities of the Levites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">36,13. אלה המצות</span><span class="font5">, “these are the commandments;” this&nbsp;concludes the list of sacrificial offerings, vows and oaths,&nbsp;purification of loot captured in war, and treatment of vessels&nbsp;that had become ritually contaminated, as well as the&nbsp;paragraphs dealing with murder and unintentional killing and&nbsp;ancestral lands and their distribution. (Compare Ibn Ezra)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Devarim</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,1. אלה הדברים</span><span class="font5">, “these are the words, etc.” wherever a paragraph is introduced with the word: אלה, it is not to be&nbsp;considered as continuation of what preceded it. Up to now&nbsp;we read about commandments involving ritual and social&nbsp;legislation, whereas from here on in we are reading words of&nbsp;admonition and warnings about a dire future for the Jewish&nbsp;people if these warnings should be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no point in countering that Numbers 36,13 also begins with the word: אלה, or to point to Leviticus 26,3-27,34,&nbsp;as in those instances the verse itself concludes the subject&nbsp;matter that had been under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל כל ישראל, </span><span class="font5">“to all the Israelites.” This teaches that Moses’ voice was powerful enough to be heard throughout&nbsp;the camp without megaphones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעבר הירדן</span><span class="font5">, the term here refers to the Israelites on the east bank of the Jordan, on the plains of Moav as mentioned&nbsp;in verse 5, not to the area settled by the tribes of Reuven and&nbsp;Gad, previously owned by the Emorites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במדבר בערבה</span><span class="font5">, in the desert, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aravah.</span><span class="font5"> In other words, the things Moses was about to speak to the Israelites here,&nbsp;he had already spoken to them about in the various places&nbsp;that will be named forthwith. We find a similar formulation in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 4,46:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במדבר </span><span class="font5">in the desert;” this is the desert facing Mount Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעברה</span><span class="font5">, “another place in the same desert known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aravah.</span><span class="font5"> It is referred to again in our portion in chapter 2,8:&nbsp;'ונעבור....מדרך הערבה מאילת ומעציון גבר וגו; which location&nbsp;precisely was this? The one opposite the reeds, the great&nbsp;desert of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Paran</span><span class="font5"> which commences at a place known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eytam.</span><span class="font5"> This is why the Torah wrote (Numbers 33,6) ויחנו&nbsp;באיתם אשר בקצה המדבר, “they encamped at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eytam</span><span class="font5"> which is at&nbsp;the edge of the desert.” Now we are told that this was also&nbsp;extending to the boundary of the land of Moav. We have&nbsp;proof of this in Deut. 2,8, as well as in Deut. 8,2. The place&nbsp;also appears in Ezekiel 20,35 as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מדבר העמים</span><span class="font5">, “desert of&nbsp;nations.” Several nations had a border touching the edge of&nbsp;this desert. This is why sometimes it appears as מדבר שור, or&nbsp;,מדבר קדמות or מדבר מואב</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בין פרן</span><span class="font5">, between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paran</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> etc., seeing that the desert was very large, Moses supplies more detail concerning where&nbsp;what had occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובין תופל ולבן, </span><span class="font5">“and between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tofel</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">and Lavan;” we are forced to use our logic concerning these names, as we have&nbsp;no documents to even prove that they existed. It is most&nbsp;likely that they were names of sites where the Israelites had&nbsp;encamped, but many may have received their names only as&nbsp;a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">result</span><span class="font5"> of having served as a base for the Israelites during&nbsp;those years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quite a few of these names did not appear in the list of the Israelites’ journey enumerated chronologically in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">parshat&nbsp;Massey.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">Some appear four times, each time with a different&nbsp;name. Compare our author on Numbers 33,19, and 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחצרות</span><span class="font5">, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chatzerot;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">according to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">this refers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font5">the rebellion of Korach, which had taken place there. If you&nbsp;were to argue that according to the sequence in which the&nbsp;Torah has documented all these events, the rebellion of&nbsp;Korach must have occurred when the Israelites were&nbsp;encamped in the desert of Paran, shortly after the return of&nbsp;the spies, and you would further argue that according to&nbsp;Targum Onkelos the Israelites were angry at the absence of&nbsp;meat at </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chatzerot,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">whereas the Torah wrote that they&nbsp;journeyed to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chatzerot</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kivrot hataavah</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font5"> the place&nbsp;where they had received the quails, (Numbers 11,35) you will&nbsp;realise the difficulty in reconciling what appear to be&nbsp;contradictory statements. The desert of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paran</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">is many days’&nbsp;march long, and to fix a place’s name based on that loose&nbsp;definition is not really helpful at all. Some of the places&nbsp;named here were quite clearly given names after the&nbsp;occurrence of the event the place was to commemorate.&nbsp;There is no guarantee that the name was given immediately&nbsp;after the event in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,2. אחד עשר יום מחורב</span><span class="font5">, “eleven days’ march from Mount Chorev.” Some of the speeches recalled by Moses here&nbsp;occurred during the journeys of the Israelites after leaving&nbsp;Mount Sinai, during the first eleven days. It took them eleven&nbsp;days to cover the distance from Mount Sinai to Kadesh, the&nbsp;place from which the spies were dispatched. The fact is that&nbsp;no new commandments were revealed to the Jewish people&nbsp;after the return of the spies until the fortieth year, after the&nbsp;last of the men of military age at the Exodus had died, and&nbsp;G’d’s presence returned to be visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחד עשר יום</span><span class="font5">, “eleven days,” there is a letter ב missing in the word אחד, which according to the rules of grammar&nbsp;should have been spelled באחד, so that the phrase would&nbsp;read: באחד עשר יום, “we find a similar anomaly in Exodus&nbsp;31,17: כי ששת ימים עשה ה' את השמים, “for during six days G’d&nbsp;made heaven, etc,” there too we would have expected the&nbsp;letter ב at the beginning of the word ששת. Our author cites a&nbsp;few more examples of this, adding that it occurs frequently.&nbsp;(Judges 14,12; Samuel II 20,4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אחד עשר יום</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands this line as a reproof by Moses, who is telling the people that although normally it&nbsp;takes eleven days to cover the distance from Mount Chorev&nbsp;to Kadesh, with the help of G’d they had covered that&nbsp;distance in only three days, seeing that the Torah had&nbsp;reported that they had broken camp on the twentieth day of&nbsp;the month of lyar. When you consider that the people had&nbsp;spent thirty days at Kivrat Hataavah consuming the quails,&nbsp;and seven days waiting for Miriam to recover from the&nbsp;affliction of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> at Chatzerot, it followed that they covered&nbsp;the distance in three days, as there had been only three way&nbsp;stations and by the 29<sup>th</sup> of Sivan the spies had been sent out,&nbsp;so that only thirty eight days had elapsed since their&nbsp;departure from Mount Chorev. (Compare author’s&nbsp;commentary on Numbers 9,1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,3. ויהי בארבעים שנה</span><span class="font5">, “it was during the fortieth year, etc.” the Torah reveals here that Moses addressed the&nbsp;people on the east bank of the Jordan, recalling what he had&nbsp;told the earlier generation already while they were at Mount&nbsp;Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בעשתי עשר חדש באחד לחדש, </span><span class="font5">“in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month. In other words, he began this&nbsp;speech 36 days prior to his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ככל אשר צוה ה' אותו, </span><span class="font5">“in accordance with all the Lord had commanded him.” The word אותו which is not really needed,&nbsp;was added to emphasise that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> had not issued such&nbsp;instructions to any other prophet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אחרי הכותו את סיחון</span><span class="font5">, “after He had smitten Sichon,&nbsp;etc.;” we have been told in Deut. 2,30 that Sichon was not&nbsp;willing to allow the Israelites to cross his territory on their way&nbsp;to the land of Canaan. Both the campaigns against Sichon&nbsp;and Og took place in the fortieth year of the Israelites’&nbsp;wanderings. Since we heard about it there we might have&nbsp;thought that these campaigns occurred after the capture of&nbsp;the lands of Sichon and Og.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.5. הואיל משה באר</span><span class="font5">, “Moses undertook to expound this&nbsp;Torah;” he expounded all the commandments in the Torah,&nbsp;including the Ten Commandments that the people had heard&nbsp;from G’d directly. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> wished that the new generation&nbsp;which had been born after the revelation at Mount Sinai,&nbsp;should hear the Ten Commandments at least from the mouth&nbsp;of Moses. He was the most reliable human being that this&nbsp;task could be entrusted to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;דבר אלינו בחרב</span><span class="font5">, “which He spoke to us at Chorev.”&nbsp;He commenced with words of encouragement (Compare&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aruch hashalem</span><span class="font5"> under the entry בדח.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;פנו ושאו לכם וגו</span><span class="font5">׳, “turn around and start journeying,&nbsp;etc.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראה נתתי לפניכם</span><span class="font5">, see, I have given before you’” (verse 8)&nbsp;Moses refers back to Exodus 23,20-32, where G’d had told&nbsp;Moses that He appointed His angel to proceed ahead of the&nbsp;people on their journey to the Holy Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בערבה</span><span class="font5">, “on the plains,” this is the plain that Moses Torah had spoken of earlier in verse 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,9. ואומר אליכם בעת ההיא</span><span class="font5">, “and I had said to you at that time;” this includes everything until verse 18 that Moses had&nbsp;commanded the people. It had been the subject in Exodus&nbsp;18,18 where Moses’ father-in-law Yitro had cautioned him&nbsp;against overexerting himself, and Moses’ response by&nbsp;appointing people to act as his delegates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,12. וריבכם</span><span class="font5">, “and your quarrels;” this refers to internal quarrels between Jew and fellow Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,13. ואשמם</span><span class="font5">, “I will appoint them;” the letter י before the&nbsp;first letter מ, is missing here</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this as&nbsp;follows: this י was deliberately removed in order to tell us that&nbsp;when the Israelites commit sins, much of the blame can be&nbsp;laid at the doorstep of the heads of the legal system that&nbsp;have not enforced Torah laws diligently and fairly. (one&nbsp;version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)</span><span class="font5"> Our author’s version did have the letter י in&nbsp;his Torah scroll. Clearly, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> Torah scroll did not have&nbsp;that letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,15. אנשים חכמים וידעים</span><span class="font5">, “wise and knowledgeable men;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> points out that apparently Moses had not found&nbsp;men possessed of בינה, insight, one of the criteria Yitro had&nbsp;told him to look for in men appointed to judge others. He had&nbsp;only found men that could be called: righteous, wise, and&nbsp;knowledgeable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask what happened to the other four qualifications stipulated by Yitro as a precondition for acting&nbsp;as a judge? (Compare Exodus 18,21) The fact that the seven&nbsp;qualifications do not appear consecutively, but only four of&nbsp;them appear in the verse quoted, is a hint that if all these&nbsp;virtues could not be found in one man, then we would have&nbsp;to settle for less. Solomon in Proverbs 31 already pointed out&nbsp;how difficult it is to find even one woman who can be&nbsp;described as אשת חיל, “a woman of valour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi B’rechyah in the name of Rabi Chama, son of Rabbi Chanina, is quoted in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deuteronomy Rabbah,</span><span class="font5"> 1,10, as&nbsp;having said: judges must possess seven virtues: wisdom,&nbsp;insight, knowledge, plus the four listed in Exodus 18,21. The&nbsp;reason that do not all appear together is to teach that the&nbsp;seven virtues are meant as in the best case scenario. If it is&nbsp;impossible to find people with all these virtues, naturally we&nbsp;have to settle for less, just as we never had a king that&nbsp;possessed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">the virtues listed in Deuteronomy 17,15-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,17. לא תגורו מפני איש</span><span class="font5">, (Moses is speaking to the judges, or potential judges) “do not display fear of anyone;”&nbsp;[you cannot be commanded not to have fear just as you&nbsp;cannot be commanded to love; but you can be commanded&nbsp;not to display your fear. Ed.] If a judge is afraid that the party&nbsp;whom he will convict will hate him henceforth, he is reminded&nbsp;that ultimately the judgment is G’ds and he had only carried&nbsp;out G’d’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואצוה אתכם בעת ההיא</span><span class="font5">, I commanded you at that&nbsp;time;” you have not been held up in the desert for 40 years in&nbsp;order to study the Torah, because I could have taught you&nbsp;the Torah in a few hours, but you were held up on account of&nbsp;your sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונסע מחורב</span><span class="font5">, ”we journeyed from Mount Chorev;”&nbsp;Moses referred to what the Torah had written in Numbers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">10,1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר צוה ה' אלוקינו אותנו</span><span class="font5">, “as the Lord our G’d commanded us;” our author has explained this already in&nbsp;verse 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונבא עד קדש ברנע, </span><span class="font5">“and we came as far as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kadesh Barnea.”</span><span class="font5"> This was on the 29<sup>th</sup> day of Sivan, as I have already&nbsp;explained on verse 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואומר אליכם, באתם עד הר </span><span class="font5">האמרי, “and I said to you:&nbsp;you have arrived at the Mountain of the Emorite;” here&nbsp;Moses refers to what has been written in Numbers 13,17: עלו&nbsp;זה בנגב ועליתם את ההר, “ascend here in the south and climb the&nbsp;mountain!” it also says there in chapter 14,40: וישכימו בבקר&nbsp;ויעלו על ראש ההר, “they arose early in the morning and&nbsp;ascended the top of the mountain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.22. ויחפרו לנו, </span><span class="font5">“and espy on our behalf;” the expression חפר describes someone searching for something,&nbsp;generally below the surface of the earth; the principal&nbsp;meaning is to search for something which has been&nbsp;deliberately hidden. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.23. שנים עשר אנשים</span><span class="font5">, “twelve men;” on this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">comments that there was no representative of the tribe of&nbsp;Levi among these 12 men. The reason was that they would&nbsp;not inherit any ancestral land in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eretz Yisrael,</span><span class="font5"> as I have&nbsp;already explained on Numbers 13,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עד נחל אשכול, </span><span class="font5">“as far as the valley of Eshkol;”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that the spies walked in a formation of&nbsp;crisscrossing the land in four directions. This has been&nbsp;explained already in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Metzia,</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;91.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,27. הוציאנו מארץ מצרים, </span><span class="font5">“He took us out of the land of Egypt;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> basing himself on Sifrey, says that G’d’s&nbsp;taking us out of Egypt was interpreted by the Israelites as an&nbsp;act of hatred; he quotes a parable with a king who owned two&nbsp;fields and had two sons. One field was very productive, as it&nbsp;was well irrigated, whereas the other one was far less so. He&nbsp;gave the productive one to his beloved son, and the inferior&nbsp;one to the son he disapproved of. The people of Israel were&nbsp;aware that Egypt was very well irrigated from the waters of&nbsp;the Nile, never depending on rainfall. On the other hand,&nbsp;Moses himself told them that the earth in the land of Israel&nbsp;depended on rainfall, and that by withholding rainfall this&nbsp;could make it very hard to work. They therefore reasoned&nbsp;that G’d must hate </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">them</span><span class="font5"> why else would He expect them to&nbsp;exchange fertile Egypt for hilly Canaan?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,36. 'מלא אחרי ה</span><span class="font5">, “who has fully followed G’d’s instructions.” Moses refers to the instructions he had issued&nbsp;in the name of G’d. [G’d did not address Calev directly, ever.&nbsp;Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1,37.'גם בי התאנף ה</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord was angry at me also.” He took the position of leader from me and gave it to Joshua; all&nbsp;of this happened only on your account when you caused me&nbsp;to lose my temper and therefore not carry out G’d’s&nbsp;instructions to me to the letter. I was punished for hitting the&nbsp;rock instead of speaking to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.40. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ואתם פנו לכם וסעו וגו</span><span class="font5">, as for you, (as opposed to&nbsp;the ten spies who died on the spot), “turn around and begin&nbsp;journeying in a reverse direction.” (Moses was quoting&nbsp;Numbers 14,25).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.41. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ותענו ותאמרו וגו</span><span class="font5">, you answered and said to me:&nbsp;“we have sinned;” we have explained verses 41-49 already in&nbsp;Numbers 14,41-43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.44. כאשר תעשינה הדבורים</span><span class="font5">, “as bees do;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">comments just as a bee sting results in that bee dying&nbsp;immediately after it has stung a human being, in other words,&nbsp;the effort expended in stinging weakens the bee so that it&nbsp;dies from exhaustion, so the Emorites who defeat you,&nbsp;though being successful, will not live to enjoy their victory,&nbsp;but die soon after. Nonetheless they did inflict a defeat on&nbsp;your soldiers so that these fled as they struck you and injured&nbsp;you; but, they did not succeed in killing a single one of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויכתו אתכם, </span><span class="font5">as far as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chormah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation; when a single bee leaves its formation, all the other bees immediately follow suit.&nbsp;Example: וירד העמלקי והכנעני, (verse 45) As soon as Amalekite&nbsp;descended all the Canaanites followed suit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויכתו אתכם</span><span class="font5">, they struck you, and they injured you, but they did not kill a single one of you. G’d did not allow this to&nbsp;happen in order that His great Name would not be belittled.&nbsp;You will note that the Torah did not list numbers of Israelites&nbsp;killed as it had elsewhere in other wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.45. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותשובו ותבכו</span><span class="font5">, “you returned (repented) and wept.”&nbsp;Moses here referred to Numbers 14,39: ויתאבלו, “they&nbsp;mourned;” as soon as they mourned for what they thought&nbsp;would be their fate in accordance with the majority report of&nbsp;the spies, G’d issued instructions concerning their immediate&nbsp;future. You commenced reversing your journeys in the&nbsp;direction of the sea of reeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1.46. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותשבו בקדש ימים רבים</span><span class="font5">, “you remained in Kadesh for&nbsp;many years.” Here we are told by Moses that they stayed at&nbsp;Kadesh Barnea for a long time, something that had not been&nbsp;spelled out in Numbers chapter 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.1. ונפן ונסע המדברה דרך ים סוף כאשר דבר</span><span class="font5">, “we turned around and journeyed into the desert in the direction of the&nbsp;sea of reeds, as G’d had said.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר ה' אלי</span><span class="font5">, ‘the Lord said to me;” this was only in&nbsp;the fortieth year when we came to Kadesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ההר הזה</span><span class="font5">, “this mountain.” This is Mount Se-ir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פנו לכם צפונה</span><span class="font5">, “turn northward!” this commandment was not meant to be carried out immediately. It went into effect&nbsp;only after the detour around the territory of Edom and Moav&nbsp;had been completed. The people appear to have&nbsp;misunderstood this part of the instructions. This may be why&nbsp;in verse 4, Moses spelled this out in greater detail. If there&nbsp;had had not been some misunderstanding it is not clear why&nbsp;they asked the King of Edom for permission to cross his&nbsp;territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,4. ואת העם צו לאמר</span><span class="font5">, “and command the people as follows:” Moses explains the warning here which he had&nbsp;failed to explain in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshat Chukat.</span><span class="font5"> On the other hand, he&nbsp;does not repeat the details of the request in Numbers 20,1421.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונעבור מאת אחינו</span><span class="font5">, “we passed by our brethren, etc.”&nbsp;they did so by turning northward as they had been&nbsp;commanded in verse 3. Their point of departure was </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ovot.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">This is why there is a most unusual end of paragraph mark&nbsp;(letter ס plus two blank spaces in our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chumashim,</span><span class="font5"> in the&nbsp;middle of a sentence.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויאמר ה' אלי: אל תצא את מואב</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord said to me:&nbsp;do not harass Moav!” He addressed me in the singular mode,&nbsp;but meant for this commandment to include the whole nation.&nbsp;The reason for this command was because Moses was going&nbsp;to be buried in the territory of Moav. G’d issued instructions&nbsp;not to harass in one way or another, three nations, Seir,&nbsp;Edom, and Moav. Their territories were not to be violated.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We know that the territory of Seir was not to be violated as this nation was also known by the name of Chivi, as&nbsp;mentioned in Genesis 36,2: אהליבמה בת ענה בת צבעון </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">החוי</span><span class="font5">. One&nbsp;could argue that this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chivi</span><span class="font5"> was one of the seven nations that&nbsp;G’d had promised to the Israelites. In order to forestall such&nbsp;claim, the Torah added in our chapter in verse 12: that the&nbsp;Chorim used to dwell in that region originally, but they had&nbsp;been supplanted by the descendants of Esau who had wiped&nbsp;out that population just as the Israelites wiped out the&nbsp;Canaanite nations when they received the Holy Land from</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d. We are to realise that basically that land belonged to the Chorim. They were not part of the seven Canaanite tribes.&nbsp;The reason they were called חוי, as explained in the Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shabbat</span><span class="font5"> folio 85, is that the original inhabitants the&nbsp;Chori, were able through their sense of smell to determine&nbsp;which kind of soil was most suitable to plant what kind of&nbsp;crop on. The Chivi, on the other hand, were able to taste the&nbsp;soil and determine what to grow on that particular soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Moav, </span><span class="font5">their land had originally been called the land of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refaim,</span><span class="font5"> (Verse 11) and it is possible that it had been&nbsp;given to Avraham as stated in Genesis 15,20, so that the&nbsp;Israelites had a certain right to claim it as their ancestral land.&nbsp;The Moabites used to call the previous inhabitants of that&nbsp;land: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eymim.</span><span class="font5"> Apparently, that was their original name, and&nbsp;they were not identical with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refaim</span><span class="font5"> given to Avraham, so&nbsp;that the Israelites had absolutely no prior claim to that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ammon. </span><span class="font5">The land occupied by the Ammonites were also part of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refaim,</span><span class="font5"> (verse 20) In order that no one&nbsp;should be able to claim it as belonging to or designated for&nbsp;Israel, Moses tells us what the names of the original&nbsp;inhabitants used to be, such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zamzumim.</span><span class="font5"> They </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5">re not to&nbsp;be confused with the Refaim given to Avraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different approach: The Israelites were specifically warned not to enter into any hostilities with these three&nbsp;nations, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">although</span><span class="font5"> they had been included in G’d’s promise to&nbsp;Avraham’s descendants in chapter 15 in the Book of&nbsp;Genesis. The peoples referred to as: Keyni, K’nizi, and&nbsp;Kadmoni, are simply different names for the people more&nbsp;commonly known as: Ammon, Moav and Edom. By using the&nbsp;expression: ונשמרתם מאד, “be extremely careful no to, etc.,”&nbsp;Moses impresses the seriousness of the sin to contravene&nbsp;this warning. The Israelites did not need to be warned&nbsp;concerning any other nations in that region, as they had&nbsp;never for a moment entertained any hostile designs against&nbsp;them, their lands not having been promised to Avraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that the promise to Avraham of the lands of the last three nations mentioned in the covenant&nbsp;between the pieces in Genesis chapter 15, was not meant to&nbsp;be fulfilled until the coming of the Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נתתי את ער ירושה</span><span class="font5">, “for I have given it to the descendants of Lot as an ancestral land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.11. רפאים יחשבו אף הם כענקים</span><span class="font5">, “the Refaim were also considered as part of a race of giants.” They were&nbsp;considered as such not because of their height, but because&nbsp;of their physical strength. That they were not truly giants is&nbsp;clear from the fact that the Moabites called them Eymim. This&nbsp;was the name by which most people called them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.12</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כאשר עשה ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “just as the Israelites did to the&nbsp;land which became their ancestral heritage.” Moses is&nbsp;speaking of the land settled by the tribes of Reuven, Gad.,&nbsp;and half the tribe of Menashe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,14. והימים אשר הלכנו מקדש ברנע</span><span class="font5">, “and the number o years it took us to walk from Kadesh barnea to the river&nbsp;Zered were 38 years.” Not all of these years were spent&nbsp;walking, of course, but the total period including the&nbsp;encampments was 38 years, until the last of the men of&nbsp;military ages at the time of the Exodus had died. The reason&nbsp;why the river Zered is named here is that it was the first of&nbsp;several rivers the Israelites crossed on their march north.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי כאשר תמו</span><span class="font5">, “it was when they completed;” the&nbsp;reason why they did not cross into the land of Canaan at&nbsp;once was out of respect for Moses for whom it had been&nbsp;decreed that he could not enter the Holy Land, and it would&nbsp;have been painful for him to see his people crossing while he&nbsp;had to remain behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל אנשי המלחמה</span><span class="font5">, “all the fighting men;” this refers to the ones who had begun to fight against Moses’ wish after the&nbsp;debacle of the spies. (Numbers 14,44)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וידבר ה' אלי</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord spoke to me;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">comments here that since the debacle with the spies G’d had&nbsp;not been reported as speaking to Moses, in the mode of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dibbur,</span><span class="font5"> which signifies fondness for the person addressed.&nbsp;This line proves that the Jewish people were in disgrace&nbsp;during the entire thirty eight years since then, and if G’d had&nbsp;communicated such a communication is described as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">amirah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">as opposed to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dibbur</span><span class="font5">. The former is a reference to a very&nbsp;brief and succinct communication. During all these years,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G’d communicated with Moses not on the “face to face basis,” while he was awake, but by nocturnal images.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וקרבת מול בני עמון</span><span class="font5">, “when you come near to being&nbsp;opposite the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Ammon;”</span><span class="font5"> actually they did not get to the&nbsp;boundary of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Ammon,</span><span class="font5"> as their lands were to the&nbsp;east of both the kingdoms of Sichon and Og, king of Bashan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.20. ארץ רפאים תחשב אף היא</span><span class="font5">, “that land was also considered as land of the Refaim.” It was considered “as if,”&nbsp;but in fact was not. They were really Zamzumim, because&nbsp;they were always implicated in a war or in the planning of a&nbsp;war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;היום הזה אחל תת פחדך</span><span class="font5">, “this day I will begin to give&nbsp;the dread of you, etc;” prior to this, when the seven&nbsp;Canaanite nations noted that the Israelites, instead of&nbsp;invading the land of the Edomites or Moabites detoured&nbsp;around their countries, they reasoned that if the Israelites&nbsp;were afraid to face these nations individually, they would be&nbsp;even more afraid to face a combination of Canaanite nations.&nbsp;When they observed that the Israelites had vanquished both&nbsp;Sichon and Og in short order, they had to revise their attitude&nbsp;and began to tremble at the thought of facing them. This is&nbsp;what G’d meant when he told Moses that as of that day the&nbsp;Canaanites dreaded the military might of the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.26. ממדבר קדמות</span><span class="font5">, “from the desert of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kedemot.”</span><span class="font5"> The name of that desert is related to the well known expression&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">קדמה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">מזרחה, “forward in an easterly direction.” In other words,&nbsp;the desert took its name from the fact that it was situated in&nbsp;the east, as opposed to the south, where most of the deserts&nbsp;in the region were located. Compare Judges 11,22: ויירשו את&nbsp;כל גבול האמורי מארנון עד היבוק ומן המדבר עד הירדן, “and they&nbsp;appropriated (as an inheritance) all the territory of the&nbsp;Ammonites from the Arnon river to the Yabbok river and from&nbsp;the wilderness to the Jordan.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דברי שלום</span><span class="font5">, “with words of peace;” seeing that most of the territory possessed by Sichon had been conquered from the&nbsp;Moabites and the Ammonites, and not from the Canaanites,&nbsp;they were sincere in their offer of traversing these lands in a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">peaceful manner. Offering peace to the seven Canaanite nations is forbidden as we know from Deut. 20,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,29. כאשר עשו לי בני עשו</span><span class="font5">, “as the descendants of Esau did for me.” This was not a reference to traversing their&nbsp;territory, but a reference to their letting the Israelites buy their&nbsp;water and food from them. The Torah had never spelled this&nbsp;out before, but it is logical to assume that they had done so,&nbsp;seeing that the Torah had specifically permitted them to do&nbsp;so. (Deut. 2,6) Our verse merely explains what was meant in&nbsp;verse 6.</span></p>
<p dir="rtl"><span class="font5">,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר עשו לי בני עשו היושבים בשעיר והמואבים היושבים בער</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“as the descendants of Esau who live in Se-ir have done for me, as well as the Moabites who dwell in Or.” It sounds clear&nbsp;that both the Moabites mentioned here as well as the&nbsp;Edomites mentioned here had volunteered to supply the&nbsp;Israelites with these victuals. This is in stark contrast to what&nbsp;the Torah had described in Deut. 23,4 as the reason why&nbsp;proselytes from the Moabites and the Ammonites must not&nbsp;be accepted. It says there that these two tribes had not come&nbsp;forward with offers of bread and water for a nation that had&nbsp;just come out of Egypt, and had hired Bileam to curse the&nbsp;Israelites. How do we reconcile these two verses? Moreover,&nbsp;the Talmud in tractate two in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot,</span><span class="font5"> folio 77, even&nbsp;tells that several hundreds of years later, some of the&nbsp;Israelites wanted to declare King David as not fit to be their&nbsp;king, but as not being Jewish, since his maternal ancestor&nbsp;Ruth had been a Moabite, and her conversion therefore was&nbsp;null and void.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In light of all this, some commentators feel forced to conclude that the verses from Deut. 2,6 until and including&nbsp;verse 29, are only Moses’ formulation of the words the&nbsp;delegation were to say to the rulers of that land, but are not&nbsp;to be understood as testimony by the Torah, and that some&nbsp;Moabites and some Edomites had come forward with such&nbsp;offers. What follows are words by Moses recalling what had&nbsp;happened in how making war on Sichon and Og had not&nbsp;been aggression by the Israelites, but self defense, as the&nbsp;other side had started the hostilities. Instead of&nbsp;understanding the Torah as telling us that the Moabites of Or&nbsp;and the Ammonites had been generous, Moses includes&nbsp;them all in a negative light. None of these kings had allowed&nbsp;the Israelites to cross their lands. The ones that got away&nbsp;with it were the ones whom G’d had commanded the&nbsp;Israelites not to harass as they were not Canaanites, on the&nbsp;contrary, were related to the Israelites through Avraham‘s&nbsp;family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2,37. רק אל ארץ בני עמון לא קרבת</span><span class="font5">, “only to the land of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Ammon</span><span class="font5"> did you not come close;” according to Ibn Ezra&nbsp;Moses speaks only of land that was in possession of that&nbsp;nation at the time he spoke. This excluded the land captured&nbsp;from Sichon, which at one time did belong to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney&nbsp;Ammon</span><span class="font5">, but which would not be returned to them by the&nbsp;Israelites who had taken it away from Sichon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,1. ונפו ונעל, </span><span class="font5">“we turned around and ascended; from the south to the north.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">דרך הבשן</span><span class="font5">, “on the way to Bashan,” which is situated between the river Jordan and the land of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Ammon.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Anyone travelling from the south to the north in that region is&nbsp;automatically ascending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הנה ערשו ערש ברזל</span><span class="font5">, “behold, his bedstead was a&nbsp;bedstead made of iron.” This need not be understood&nbsp;literally; it means that the materials used in constructing Og’s&nbsp;bedstead were as sturdy as if they had been made out of&nbsp;strong metal. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span><span class="font5"> The word ערש occurs in Amos&nbsp;3,12 as meaning: the leg of a bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תשע אמות ארכה </span><span class="font5">“it was nine cubits long.” (about 5,4 meters.) This is the average height of the walls of walled&nbsp;cities in those days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באמת איש</span><span class="font5">, measurements applied to fully mature men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת הארץ הזאת ירשנו</span><span class="font5">, “and this land we have&nbsp;inherited;” this phrase is abbreviated; the line should have&nbsp;begun with the words: ‘”and this land which we have&nbsp;inherited at that time ...as well as its towns, I have given to&nbsp;the tribe of Reuven.” All of this has been explained in&nbsp;Numbers 32,33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,18. ואצו אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “I commanded you;” Moses addresses the tribe of Reuven, Gad and half the tribe of Menashe. The&nbsp;reason he used the pronoun אתכם, “you,” instead of as we&nbsp;might have expected אותם, “them,” is because these two and&nbsp;a half tribes remained part of the Jewish nation made up of&nbsp;twelve tribes owning ancestral land. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,21. ואת יהושע צותי</span><span class="font5">, “and I have commanded Joshua;” this is what has been written in Numbers 27,23: ויסמוך ידיו עליו&nbsp;ויצוהו, “he (Moses) placed his hands firmly upon him, and he&nbsp;commanded him.”</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Va-etchanan</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואתחנן</span><span class="font5">, “I pleaded;” the root חנן when used in the&nbsp;reflexive conjugation occurs in this sense also in Genesis&nbsp;41,21 when Joseph is described as pleading with his&nbsp;brothers. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> who considers the root of the&nbsp;word to be חנם, the final letter ן at the end, should really have&nbsp;been a final ם.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ה' אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, the first name of G’d here is a reference&nbsp;to the attribute </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aleph dalet,</span><span class="font5"> not to the tetragram, (an attribute&nbsp;that can be used normally only by the High priest in the Holy&nbsp;of Holies on the Day of Atonement). The second attribute&nbsp;used by Moses here is the tetragram. (Nachmanides)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אתה החלות להראות</span><span class="font5">, “You have begun to show;” Moses refers to the conquest of the lands of Sichon and Og by the&nbsp;army of the Israelites, a feat which would have been&nbsp;unthinkable without G’d’s active intervention. Since he had&nbsp;been permitted to witness this, he pleaded to also be&nbsp;permitted to witness the conquest of the lands occupied by&nbsp;the other five Canaanite tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כמעשיך</span><span class="font5">, “as Your (other) works;” all of which demonstrate Your superior wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכגבורתך</span><span class="font5">, ”and Your superior abilities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אעברה נא ואראה את הארץ הטובה</span><span class="font5">, “please let me cross&nbsp;and see first hand the good land;” the question asked by&nbsp;most commentators is if Moses really only wanted to cross&nbsp;the Jordan for the mundane purpose of enjoying the fruit that&nbsp;grew in the Holy Land. It appears unbelievable to them that&nbsp;this could be the correct interpretation of this verse. They&nbsp;therefore conclude that the meaning of Moses’ plea was that&nbsp;he wished to be able to fulfill the many commandments of the&nbsp;Torah that can be fulfilled </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> while the person doing so is&nbsp;on the soil of the Holy Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והלבנון</span><span class="font5">, “and the Lebanon.” The word: הלבנון here is a simile for the permanent Temple. (Ibn Ezra) Seeing that&nbsp;Solomon used the cedar wood of that region to line the inner&nbsp;walls of the Temple that he built, this interpretation is not as&nbsp;far fetched as it might appear to some.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתעבר ה' בי למענכם</span><span class="font5">, “but the Lord was angry at me&nbsp;for your sakes;” G’d had said to Moses: “if you cross the&nbsp;Jordan into the Holy Land, people will say that the decree&nbsp;against the generation which had come out of Egypt to die in&nbsp;the desert was because they had forfeited their claim on an&nbsp;afterlife. If I now allow you to enter the Holy Land in response&nbsp;to your prayer, they will say that Moses was not concerned&nbsp;with anyone but himself. Therefore you will be buried where&nbsp;they are buried, and both you and they will rise at the time of&nbsp;the resurrection and live in the Holy Land.” This is the&nbsp;meaning of: ויתא ראשי עם in Deuteronomy 33,21: “they (the&nbsp;tribe of Gad) positioned himself at the head of the fighting&nbsp;men of the people”, i.e. as the pioneers. Moses, by agreeing&nbsp;to be buried in the fields of Moab displayed his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">total&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">identification with the fate of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">רב לך</span><span class="font5">, “it is enough for you;” the fact that you merited to experience the conquest of the lands of Sichon and Og.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As far as your request to cross the Jordan is concerned, do not continue to belabour this subject with Me.&nbsp;As far as your request to see the land with your own eyes, is&nbsp;concerned, I am willing to grant that wish of yours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עלה על ראש הפסגה</span><span class="font5">, “ascend to the top of the&nbsp;summit;” if you were to ask who it is that will cross the Jordan&nbsp;with these people, command Joshua to do so. [The reader&nbsp;must appreciate that when Moses tells the people here that&nbsp;he had pleaded with G’d, his plea had been made&nbsp;immediately after he had been told that he would not be&nbsp;allowed to cross the Jordan, after he had struck the rock.&nbsp;(verse 28)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'עלה ראש הפסגה וגו</span><span class="font5">, this is what G’d had told Moses already in the portion of Pinchas, Numbers 27,12 when He&nbsp;had said to him: עלה אל הר העברים, “ascend to the top of Mount&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avarim.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3,29. ונשב בגיא</span><span class="font5">, “we settled down in the valley.” Moses refers to Numbers 25,1, 'וישב ישראל בשיטים ויחל העם לזנות וגו,&nbsp;Israel settled down at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shittim,</span><span class="font5"> and the people began to&nbsp;indulge in harlotry, etc.” At that time, 24000 of them fell victim&nbsp;to a plague as a result of their misconduct. As a result of this&nbsp;we are still stuck here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ועתה ישראל וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and now, Israel, etc;” according to&nbsp;the beginning of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> at the beginning of this paragraph,&nbsp;the words: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועתה ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “and now, Israel, etc.;” are Moses’&nbsp;introduction to relating laws in the Torah, after he had&nbsp;reminded the people why it had taken so long since the&nbsp;Exodus until now and the reason why they were still on the&nbsp;east bank of the river Jordan. He had reviewed how in spite&nbsp;of all the disappointments that their conduct had caused G’d,&nbsp;He had not stopped displaying His fondness for them in a&nbsp;tangible manner each day. He, Moses, would have long ago&nbsp;been able to enter the Holy Land had it not been for the&nbsp;delays caused by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">them</span><span class="font5">, and his having exhausted the&nbsp;lifespan accorded to him during those years. [His having&nbsp;struck the rock by mistake would have been a scenario that&nbsp;could </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span><span class="font5"> have occurred but for </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">their</span><span class="font5"> having been&nbsp;condemned to be in the desert for so many years. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It certainly was time for them now to listen to all the laws that it would be their duty to observe once they crossed&nbsp;the river Jordan</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למען תחיו, </span><span class="font5">in order that you will continue to live;” the people who had worshipped the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peor</span><span class="font5"> had all been killed for&nbsp;having failed to keep such a basic commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובאתם אתם וירשתם, </span><span class="font5">“therefore it is up to you to inherit” by keeping G’d’s commandments. Do not think or even say,&nbsp;since Moses had been told by G’d that the lsraelites standing&nbsp;in front of Him in Numbers 26,53, who had been told that the&nbsp;land would be distributed to them, this was the kind of&nbsp;promise that could not be revoked if they would prove&nbsp;unworthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.2. לא תוסיפו על הדבר</span><span class="font5">ת ״, “do not add to the word, etc.” Moses reminds the people that when they had been told in&nbsp;Deut. 1,21 עלה רש “ascend and take ancestral possession,”&nbsp;they had added a condition of their own by requesting to&nbsp;dispatch spies. If they had not done so, they would have&nbsp;settled in the Holy Land 40 years earlier and would not have&nbsp;had to watch a whole generation die in the desert. Their&nbsp;fathers had become corpses in the desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא תגרעו ממנו, “</span><span class="font5">nor must you diminish any of G’d’s words as spelled out in the Torah. After the debacle with the&nbsp;spies, when some of you had decided to after all fulfill G’d’s&nbsp;command of ascending to conquer, I had warned you that&nbsp;you would do so at your peril and that you would fail and&nbsp;suffer casualties (compare Numbers 14,42.) You decided to&nbsp;ignore my warning and as a result you paid dearly for that&nbsp;omission. (Compare Numbers 14,45)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From now on I warn you to accept My commandments as given without emendations of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of the verse commencing with: “do not add, etc.” The verse is a response to the heretics&nbsp;who deny the validity of the Talmud, by quoting this verse&nbsp;and by pointing out that the sages of the Talmud had ignored&nbsp;it, adding laws of their own by the hundreds. The answer of&nbsp;the sages is that the warning not to add or subtract from the&nbsp;laws of the Torah appears only twice, each time in&nbsp;connection with idolatry, i.e. not to violate the belief and&nbsp;service of the One and only Creator. Immediately following&nbsp;this warning, the Torah illustrates its meaning by reminding&nbsp;the people of what happened to those who had worshipped&nbsp;Peor in addition, (verse 3) Also in Deut. 13,1, the Torah&nbsp;illustrates what is meant by this law by reminding people not&nbsp;to sacrifice any of their children to the cult of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">moloch.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">(Deut. 12,31)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When it comes to any of the other commandments, however, the sages are not only entitled but encouraged to&nbsp;surround the Biblical laws with “fences,” in order to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">protect</span><span class="font5"> us&nbsp;not to violate the Biblical laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,3. עיניכם הרואות</span><span class="font5">, “Your eyes which have seen, etc.;” in&nbsp;verse 1 of this chapter Moses had told us to observe the laws&nbsp;of the Torah to ensure that the people whom he addressed&nbsp;would indeed inherit the Holy Land. It was also a warning not&nbsp;to once more miss that opportunity as it had been missed a&nbsp;few months earlier by 24000 of them who had worshipped&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peor.</span><span class="font5"> This had happened to them although up until that&nbsp;moment their conduct had entitled them to inherit their&nbsp;shares of that land. The previous generation had all died&nbsp;because of the sin related to the spies, and immediately after&nbsp;that G’d had told me that the time had come to make up for&nbsp;this now, and even now some of the people had wasted that&nbsp;opportunity by worshipping </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peor,</span><span class="font5"> The time had therefore&nbsp;come to repeat the warning not to deviate by one iota in the&nbsp;laws concerning idolatry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,7. בכל קראינו אליו</span><span class="font5">, “whenever we call upon Him.” Whenever we make an effort to call upon His assistance;&nbsp;(compare: Deut.4,29): ובקשתם משם את ה' אלוקיך ומצאת כי תדרשנו&nbsp;בכל לבבך ובכל נפשך, “but from there (exile) you will seek the&nbsp;Lord your G’d; you will find Him if you seek Him out with all&nbsp;your heart and all your soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,9. </span><span class="font5">אשר ראו עיניך, which your eyes have seen.”&nbsp;Compare Exodus 20,18: “and all the people </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">saw</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;thunder.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,11. ותעמדון תחת ההר</span><span class="font5">, “you were standing at the bottom of the Mountain.” Compare Exodus 19,17: ויתיצבו בתחתית ההר&nbsp;“they stood (at attention) at he base of the Mountain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וההר בוער באש עד לב השמים חשך ענן וערפל</span><span class="font5">, “and the Mountain was ablaze with fire to the very heart of the&nbsp;heavens, darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.” If you were to&nbsp;say that the beginning of this verse appears to contradict its&nbsp;end seeing that if something burns and is aflame, there is&nbsp;obviously no darkness there? The miracle at the time was&nbsp;that darkness and light co-existed. Moses continues by&nbsp;explaining what took place: The Lord spoke to you out of the&nbsp;fire; what you </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">heard,</span><span class="font5"> were the sounds of His voice. However,&nbsp;you had no vision of something by means of a picture, an&nbsp;illustration. The reason that you could not see the vision, the&nbsp;picture, was that it was enveloped by different degrees of&nbsp;darkness. This had to be so, as no human being is allowed a&nbsp;visual image of the essence of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד לב השמים</span><span class="font5">, a figure of speech, as the heaven does not have a heart; it is a simile for the center of heaven, its&nbsp;innermost part. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,13. ויגד לכם את בריתו</span><span class="font5">, “He declared unto you His covenant.” All the other commandments were revealed to&nbsp;you through me. He instructed me to do so at that time.&nbsp;(Compare verse 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,15. כל תמונה, </span><span class="font5">“any visual image.” Compare Exodus&nbsp;20,10: לא תעשה כל מלאכה, which cannot mean: “you must not&nbsp;do </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font5"> work,” but must mean: “you shall not perform </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">any&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">kind of work, such as, etc.” The author refers the reader to&nbsp;additional examples of this formulation in Exodus 22,21, as&nbsp;well as in our verse, תמונת כל סמל, as well as verses 17 and&nbsp;18 in our chapter. In all of these examples the word כל does&nbsp;not mean “all,” but “any.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;פן תשחיתון</span><span class="font5">, “lest you will become corrupt;” this&nbsp;refers to the previous verse in which the people had been&nbsp;reminded that even during the revelation at Mount Sinai they&nbsp;had never had a visual image of their G’d. How much less&nbsp;are they allowed to fashion imaginary images of Him, and&nbsp;become thoroughly corrupted in their belief in the One and&nbsp;only but </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">invisible</span><span class="font5"> G’d, their Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר תעוף בשמים</span><span class="font5">, ”which flies in the heavens.”&nbsp;There are many places in the Bible where the atmosphere is&nbsp;simply referred to as שמים, “heaven.” The author refers the&nbsp;reader to his commentary on Genesis 1,20, where he dealt&nbsp;with this topic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לכל העמים</span><span class="font5">, “unto all the peoples;” the luminaries&nbsp;shine for all of mankind, regardless of their religious&nbsp;orientation. They shine equally for the dumb and the&nbsp;intelligent, the righteous or the evil doers. Anyone who&nbsp;worships such phenomena which do not distinguish between&nbsp;different categories of creatures, must surely consider&nbsp;himself as having been greatly humiliated by such “gods.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation about the words: לכל.....אשר חלק</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">העמים, “which He has assigned to all the nations.” According to this approach, the phenomena in the sky are indeed&nbsp;intended to exert a degree of awe for all the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">other</span><span class="font5"> nations,&nbsp;barring the Jewish people. You, the Jewish people whom G’d&nbsp;has chosen as His inheritance on earth, it behooves not to&nbsp;bow down to any power but to Him. They need not be in awe&nbsp;of any </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">other</span><span class="font5"> phenomena in nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויוצא אתכם מכור הברזל</span><span class="font5">, “He has taken you out of the&nbsp;iron crucible;” Rabbi Akiva says that by this G’d (Moses)&nbsp;refers to the gentiles who burn their first born sons as&nbsp;sacrifices to their “so-called” deities. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Yakut Shimoni</span><span class="font5"> on this&nbsp;verse, quoting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pirkey de</span><span class="font5"> Rabbi Eliezer).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4, 21. התאנף בי על דבריכם</span><span class="font5">, “He (the Lord) was angry at me on your account; in spite of this I am warning you: “be on&nbsp;your guard!”(verse 23)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי אנכי מת בארץ הזאת</span><span class="font5">, “for I am going to die in this&nbsp;land;” this is why I must warn you now not to forget my&nbsp;teachings, as once you have crossed the Jordan I will no&nbsp;longer be with you. If I would have been able to cross with&nbsp;you, I would have been in a position to actively prevent you&nbsp;from forgetting the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אינני עובר את הירדן</span><span class="font5">, “I am not going to cross the river Jordan.” You will therefore realise that what I am telling you&nbsp;is not for my benefit, but for yours. I will no longer have to&nbsp;fulfill the Torah’s commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> אשר צון* ה' אלוקיך</span><span class="font5">, “which the Lord your G’d has commanded you.” These words refer to the beginning of the&nbsp;verse, i.e. for you not to forget the covenant with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the words quoted mean: “as I have commanded you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אש אוכלה הוא</span><span class="font5">, “He, (the Lord) is a devouring fire.”&nbsp;He is comparable to a devouring fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.25. כי תוליד בנים ובני בנים</span><span class="font5">, “When you shall beget children, and children’s children;” Moses implies that when&nbsp;he warned the people not to forget the Lord’s covenant, he&nbsp;did not refer to the generation he was addressing. He was&nbsp;not worried that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> would forget. What he was concerned&nbsp;about was future generations, who had not been eye&nbsp;witnesses to what the Lord had done for the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונושנתם בארץ</span><span class="font5">, “and you have become old-established in the land;” you will therefore take it for granted and not worry&nbsp;about ever losing that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4.26. את השמים ואת הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “both heaven and earth;” Moses refers to all the stars in heaven, as well as to the&nbsp;permanent and unalterable phenomena that are part of the&nbsp;earth. [The rock of Gibraltar, the Himalayan Mountains, etc.&nbsp;Ed.] (Compare Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,28. 'ועבדתם שם וגו</span><span class="font5">, “and there you will worship, etc.” We find a similar construction in Chronicles II 15,3: וימים רבים&nbsp;לישראל ללא אלוהי אמת, וללא כהן מורה, וללא מורה וללא תורה.”^^!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">has gone many years without the true G’d, without a priest to give them instruction, and without teaching and without the&nbsp;Torah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,32. כי שאל נא</span><span class="font5">, “for ask now of the days past;” make enquiries of earlier generations if any nation ever&nbsp;experienced what you have been granted to experience;”&nbsp;seeing that we have been granted more privileges than any&nbsp;generation of mankind experienced, our G’d is especially&nbsp;mindful that we do not prove ungrateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,34. ?או הנסה</span><span class="font5">, “or did He ever test or examine?” This is&nbsp;all part of the questions you must ask yourselves</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לקחת לו גוי מקרב גוי, </span><span class="font5">“to take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, etc.;” after all, you were Egyptians&nbsp;just like all the other Egyptians. We have proof of this from&nbsp;Ezekiel 20,7: ואומר אליהם איש גלולי עיניו השליכו, “I also said to&nbsp;them: cast away everyone of you all the detestable things&nbsp;that you are drawn to.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובמלחמה</span><span class="font5">, “and by war;” for the Lord fought on their behalf against Egypt. (Exodus 14,25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובמוראים</span><span class="font5">, “all very visibly.” [The author, basing himself on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum</span><span class="font5"> traces the word to ראה, “to see.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,37. ויבחר בזרעו אחריו</span><span class="font5">, “and chose their seed after them;” this is a hint to Yaakov; if the Torah had written: בזרעם&nbsp;אחריהם, it could have been interpreted as eight nations. (the&nbsp;six sons of Keturah, Esau and Ishmael) all of whom had&nbsp;emerged from Avraham and Yitzchok) in addition to the&nbsp;Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויוציאך בפניו</span><span class="font5">, and Who brought you out from its presence (the Egyptians’) as was spelled out presently, in Exodus&nbsp;12,41: “יצאו כל צבאות ה' לעיני מצרים, “all the hosts of the Lord&nbsp;went out from the land of Egypt.” This is not the only time in&nbsp;the Bible that Egypt is referred to in the singular mode, i.e.&nbsp;בפניו instead of בפניהם. One example that comes to mind, is&nbsp;Exodus 14,10: והנה מצרים נוסע אחריהם, and behold: Egypt is&nbsp;marching after them, instead of “are marching after them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,38. כיום הזה, </span><span class="font5">as on this day; the day on which the Israelites had conquered the lands of Sichon and Og.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,41. אז יבדיל משה</span><span class="font5">, “then Moses separated;” after having defeated Sichon and Og; the commandment to establish&nbsp;cities of refuge had been given already in Numbers 35,14.&nbsp;Here the Torah only mentions that it now had been carried&nbsp;out as the requisite land had been conquered. Moses&nbsp;mentions it only as one of many positive measures he had&nbsp;undertaken on the people’s behalf. Although he could have&nbsp;described this in the first person, i.e. “I set apart these cities,”&nbsp;it was not in his nature to do so, just as he did not do so in&nbsp;Leviticus 1,2, when he described “if anyone of you is willing&nbsp;to offer an offering to the Lord,” he actually had himself in&nbsp;mind. The same is true of Exodus 16,32, and numerous&nbsp;other occasions in the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,43. ואת ראמות בגלעד</span><span class="font5">, “and Ramot in Gilad;” from here we could infer that the tribe of Menashe did not own any land&nbsp;in that region. On the other hand, the Torah wrote in&nbsp;Numbers 32,40 that Moses gave the Gilad to Machir, son of&nbsp;Menashe. How are we to account for this discrepancy? We&nbsp;must assume that the tribes that settled on the east bank of&nbsp;the Jordan all shared some territory formerly known as Gilad.&nbsp;The same appears the case when the Torah wrote in Deut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">3,12: וחצי הר הגלעד ועריו נתתי לראובני ולגדי, ויתר הגלעד נתתי לחצי שבט המנשה, “and I gave half of the mountain of Gilad and its&nbsp;towns to Reuven and Gad; and the remainder of the Gilad I&nbsp;gave to half the tribe of Menashe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4,45. אלה העדות והחוקים</span><span class="font5">, “These are the testimonial laws and the statutes;” wherever a paragraph is introduced with&nbsp;the word אלה, this constitutes a break with what had&nbsp;preceded it. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’mot Rabbah</span><span class="font5"> 1,2) What the Torah says it that&nbsp;the laws given to the people after the Exodus from Egypt&nbsp;have now been concluded. Laws that follow were not&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">revealed</span><span class="font5"> to the people until the fortieth year. The details of&nbsp;laws pertaining to cities of refuge were not revealed until&nbsp;now. [Exodus 21 13, in which mention is made of a place&nbsp;where an inadvertent killer can flee to, apparently did not&nbsp;provide details. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">העדות</span><span class="font5">, the word means the same as התראות, “encounter,” it is used in this sense in Exodus 19,21: רד העד&nbsp;בעם, “descend and warn the people by meeting them.”&nbsp;[Normally the word עדות means “testimony,” eye witness&nbsp;report, i.e. the witness had been present at the occurrence&nbsp;about which he testifies. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,1. אל כל ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “to all of Israel;” they were to all have part in the reading of the ten Commandments by Moses by&nbsp;witnessing it. Everyone who had been born </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;revelation at Mount Sinai was to be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,3. לא את אבותינו </span><span class="font5">(</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לבדם</span><span class="font5">) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כרת את הברית כי אתנו אנחנו</span><span class="font5">, “not&nbsp;only with our fathers (alone) did the Lord establish the&nbsp;covenant;” we find a similar formulation in Genesis 32,29 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא&nbsp;יקרא שמך יעקב כי אם ישראל </span><span class="font5">(</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עמו</span><span class="font5">), “your name will no longer be&nbsp;Yaakov, but the name Yisrael will henceforth be added to it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find a similar interpretation in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash Tehillim </span><span class="font5">on Psalms 8,3: מפי עוללים ויונקים יסדת עוז, “from the mouths of&nbsp;infants and sucklings You have founded strength.” This is&nbsp;interpreted to mean that even unborn children have received&nbsp;the Torah and are guarantors for this to their parents that&nbsp;they will observe the Torah in due course. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">describes the unborn fetuses as having been given visions of&nbsp;G’d and having heard the Ten Commandments, and&nbsp;responded after each that they considered it as binding for&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אתנו אנחנו</span><span class="font5">, “but with us here” (He concluded the covenant). Even though there are quite a few amongst us&nbsp;here to day who have not stood at Mount Sinai, not having&nbsp;been born yet, the covenant applies to them and is binding&nbsp;on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[The answer to the question of how an unborn person can be held accountable for violating a covenant he had not&nbsp;been a party to when it was concluded, is that in Jewish law&nbsp;one may accept obligations on behalf of people who are not&nbsp;present and aware of it, provided that these obligations are&nbsp;for the benefit of the party on whose behalf these obligations&nbsp;have been accepted. Becoming part of G’d’s people is&nbsp;perceived of being such a benefit. Ed.] The proof that this is&nbsp;so is that G’d has told us that He is meting out penalties for&nbsp;up to the fourth generation after the sinner committed his sin,&nbsp;whereas He allows even the descendent 1000 generations&nbsp;down the line to participate in the reward given to his forbear&nbsp;for good deeds performed. (Exodus 20,6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.4. פנים בפנים דבר ה' עמכם</span><span class="font5">, “The Lord spoke with you face to face;” Moses refers to the first two commandments&nbsp;that G’d addressed directly to all the people, before they&nbsp;asked Moses to become their go-between as they found&nbsp;G’d’s voice too overpowering and were afraid of dying.&nbsp;(Compare verse 22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אנכי עומד בין ה' ובינכם</span><span class="font5">, “I stood between the Lord and&nbsp;between you;” I did so in order to convey the other eight&nbsp;commandments to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא עליתם בהר לאמר, </span><span class="font5">and you did not ascend the Mountain;” you did not have to ascend the Mountain during&nbsp;the revelation of the Ten Commandments, nor as I did for 40&nbsp;days thereafter in order to receive the whole Torah. (Ibn&nbsp;Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,10. ולשומרי מצותו</span><span class="font5">, “and to those who observe His commandments. The word מצותו is read as if it had been&nbsp;spelled מצותיו, “His commandments” (pl.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,12. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">שמור</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> את יום השבת</span><span class="font5">, “to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">observe</span><span class="font5"> the Sabbath day.” In the first version of the Ten Commandments the Torah wrote:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">זכור</span><span class="font5"> את יום השבת, “to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">remember</span><span class="font5"> the Sabbath day.” This was in&nbsp;order to remind the people of the Sabbath each week as they&nbsp;were not to go out looking for manna. Now, in the fortieth&nbsp;year, when the people had been familiar with the manna&nbsp;since the day they were born, it was more appropriate for&nbsp;Moses to underline the importance of the observance of the&nbsp;commandments related to Sabbath observance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation for the difference in the terminology used on these two occasions for the law to keep&nbsp;the Sabbath day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression שמר also means “to remember.” It was used first by Yaakov when Joseph related the dream to him&nbsp;in which sun, moon and eleven stars bowed down to him&nbsp;(Genesis 37,11) The word שמר refers to long term&nbsp;remembering. Yaakov/Joseph had to wait for 22 years until&nbsp;they understood the meaning of that dream. זכור, on the other&nbsp;hand, refers to remembering for a short period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is also possible that the expression זכור is addressed to people embarking on protracted voyages on the sea,&nbsp;where they may lose track of time, whereas the expression&nbsp;שמור is addressed to people living on dry land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">*כאשר צון</span><span class="font5">, “as He has commanded you.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">comments that this commandment was first issued at Marah&nbsp;(Exodus 15,25.) When the first version of the Ten&nbsp;Commandments was read to the people, they were to&nbsp;remember that already at Marah they had received&nbsp;instructions about parts of the Sabbath legislation. In our&nbsp;paragraph, the people had to be reminded that actually the&nbsp;Sabbath legislation had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">preceded</span><span class="font5"> the revelation on Mount&nbsp;Sinai, and that the bulk of that legislation had been taught to&nbsp;the people already at Marah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We can find proof of this in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Haggadah shel Pessach,</span><span class="font5"> where the author, recounting 15 stages of gifts we&nbsp;had received from G’d, states specifically that if G’d had&nbsp;given us only the Sabbath, and never added the revelation at&nbsp;Mount Sinai, this too would have been ample reason to thank&nbsp;Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the plain meaning of the words כאשר צוך is that G’d when He commanded us to observe the Sabbath by&nbsp;reminding us that we should emulate Him and rest on that&nbsp;day just as He had rested on that day. (Exodus 20 11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation: seeing that this expression also occurs in the fifth commandment, which follows&nbsp;immediately, and these two commandments comprise both&nbsp;negative and positive aspects, they are especially to be&nbsp;remembered for that feature. [This is according to the view&nbsp;that both the word זכור and the word שמור, mean: “to&nbsp;remember.” Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,15. וזכרת כי עבד היית</span><span class="font5">, “you shall remember that you used to be a slave;” the reason why this has been written&nbsp;here, i.e. that your male and female servants also have to&nbsp;rest on the Sabbath, is that we ourselves were slaves and&nbsp;did not enjoy the luxury of resting on the Sabbath. We must&nbsp;not treat our slaves as we have been treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the first version of the Ten Commandments that were given on a joyous occasion, the Torah did not want to&nbsp;dampen our sense of joy by reminding us of our low status in&nbsp;Egypt. It therefore omitted mentioning that we used to be&nbsp;slaves. [Besides, 49 days after having escaped from Egypt,&nbsp;who would need a reminder of that? Ed.] It was sufficient to&nbsp;emphasise that it was G’d Who had taken us out of Egypt,&nbsp;and that we had not staged a revolt to bring this about.&nbsp;(Exodus 20,2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: if G’d redeemed us from slavery and intolerable conditions and gave us the Sabbath&nbsp;as a reminder, our own slaves are certainly to be granted no&nbsp;less by us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי עבד היית בארץ מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “for you were a slave in the land of Egypt.” In this version of the Ten Commandments, G’d&nbsp;does not emphasise His being the Creator of the universe in&nbsp;six days, (Exodus 20,11) and this is why we mention this&nbsp;when we recite the blessing over wine when making </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kiddush,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">i.e. sanctifying the Sabbath. On other special occasions that&nbsp;do not symbolise the creation of the universe, we content&nbsp;ourselves with reminding ourselves of the making of the&nbsp;Jewish nation, i. e. זכר ליציאת מצרים, “a reminder of the&nbsp;Exodus from Egypt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על כן</span><span class="font5">, “therefore,” G’d wishes us to remember that our status in Egypt was a deplorable one, we were lowly slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולמען ייטב לך, </span><span class="font5">“and in order that it will go well with&nbsp;you;” in the first version of the commandment to honour our&nbsp;parents, this promise of a reward was absent. In other words,&nbsp;G’d promises an </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">additional</span><span class="font5"> reward for honouring our parents.&nbsp;A careful reading of the first version of the Ten&nbsp;Commandments will reveal that the letter </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ט </span><span class="font5">is the only letter&nbsp;of the Hebrew alphabet that did not appear in it. The second&nbsp;version therefore includes it, as that letter symbolises טוב&nbsp;goodness. Moses caught on to this and took it upon himself&nbsp;to make up for this deficiency by adding a line that included&nbsp;this letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עד שוא</span><span class="font5">, “a vain witness.” If someone testifies&nbsp;against someone whom he had seen perform a crime&nbsp;deliberately, but his testimony is not supported by a second&nbsp;witness without which a conviction could not be obtained, he&nbsp;is not to come forward to bring a charge that he knows the&nbsp;court cannot deal with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,18. ולא תתאוה</span><span class="font5">, “and you shall not covet.” The&nbsp;expression “to covet” is used only when it describes the&nbsp;desire of one’s heart, not when one plans to act upon that&nbsp;desire. (Ibn Ezra) As soon as someone becomes aware, that&nbsp;his neighbour, due to various kinds of pressure is known to&nbsp;consider selling it and instead of financially supporting his&nbsp;neighbour exploits his reduced circumstances, and decides&nbsp;in his mind to buy it from him, he has violated this&nbsp;commandment. When he expressed his intention by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mouth</span><span class="font5">,&nbsp;he has violated the commandment of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תחמד</span><span class="font5">, as written at&nbsp;the beginning of verse 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the last five commandments are introduced with the connective letter ו except for the first one in that string, the&nbsp;warning not to commit murder, i.e. לא תרצח. In all the Ten&nbsp;Commandments, commencing with the word: אנכי, until the&nbsp;words: ולשומרי מצותו at the end of verse 10, there is no&nbsp;difference between the wording of the first set of the Ten&nbsp;Commandments and the wording of the second set, as G’d&nbsp;repeated the wording, and therefore their meaning is&nbsp;identical in both instances. Moses had not intended to&nbsp;introduce any changes either. However, in the second&nbsp;version in our chapter, the changes that Moses did introduce&nbsp;did not change the meaning of the commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a general rule concerning when something in the Torah has been repeated, you will always find a minor&nbsp;change in the wording or spelling. The change you see was&nbsp;part of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">original</span><span class="font5"> Torah </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">scroll</span><span class="font5"> and has not been introduced&nbsp;subsequently. The Ten Commandments on the first set of the&nbsp;Tablets, which Moses had smashed and the Commandments&nbsp;on the second Tablets quoted in the Book of Deuteronomy&nbsp;are identical with the exception of that addition for the reason&nbsp;given for the commandment to honour one’s parents. What&nbsp;we see written down in the Book of Deuteronomy is the&nbsp;version of the second set of Tablets Moses received from&nbsp;G’d. Basically, the text in the Torah scroll Moses handed&nbsp;down to us is the one that represents Moses’ words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here Moses arranged the order of the examples quoted in the tenth commandment, according to how people develop&nbsp;desires as they grow older. First they desire a better house,&nbsp;one that that they could not afford previously. Next, they&nbsp;desire a woman who they feel has more to offer them than&nbsp;the one they had married when relatively young and&nbsp;inexperienced. Next they also desire such assets as make&nbsp;life more comfortable, even if they have to acquire them by&nbsp;making someone who owns them part with theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,19. קול גדול ולא יסף, </span><span class="font5">“with a strong voice that did not weaken;” according to our sages this voice continued to be&nbsp;heard during the entire forty days that Moses spent on Mount&nbsp;Sinai, immediately after the revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of that line: the words ולא יסף mean that the Israelites did not hear anything but the Ten&nbsp;Commandments, so as no to distract them. This would be in&nbsp;line with Jeremiah 45,3: כי יסף מכאוב על מכאובי,”for He had&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">added</span><span class="font5"> to my grief.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,24. ואת תדבר אלינו</span><span class="font5">, “and you shall speak to us;” Moses’ voice, a voice familiar to them and not so overpowering,&nbsp;would be easier to bear, so that they could understand it&nbsp;better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,26. מי יתן והיה לבבם </span><span class="font5">, “Oh that they had such a heart, etc.;” even though it was within G’d’s power to grant the&nbsp;people such a heart, He preferred to use a syntax familiar to&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5,28. ואתה פה עמוד עמדי</span><span class="font5">, “but as for you, stay here with Me!” G’d invites Moses to again spend time with Him by&nbsp;ascending the Mountain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועשו בארץ, </span><span class="font5">“in order that they will perform them in the land, etc.” Moses refers to what he had said in Deut. 4,14:,&nbsp;that the Lord had commanded him to teach the people His&nbsp;commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,2. *אשר אנכי מצון</span><span class="font5">, “which I am commanding you.” The letter ך at the end of the word מצוך, is “weak,” (does not have&nbsp;a dot in it).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ארץ זבת חלב ודבש</span><span class="font5">, “a land flowing with milk and&nbsp;honey.” This is an abbreviated sentence, and should read:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר דבר ה' אלוקי אבותיך לתת לך ארץ זבת חלב ודבש</span><span class="font5">, “as the Lord&nbsp;the G’d of your father said to give you a land flowing with milk&nbsp;and honey.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: there is only a letter ב missing at the beginning of the word ארץ. We have other&nbsp;such examples such as in Kings II 12,11: 'הנמצא בית ה where&nbsp;we would have expected 'הנמצא ב בית ה, “which is in the&nbsp;Temple.” The author claims that there are numerous more&nbsp;such examples that he could quote. The sentence would&nbsp;conclude by saying that “as the Israelites would greatly&nbsp;multiply, (something not surprising), seeing that the land is&nbsp;flowing with milk and honey.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שמע ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “Hear O Israel!” we have an aggadic text&nbsp;according to which the letter ע in the word שמע is supposed to&nbsp;be “hanging”, i.e. not written directly on the line with the other&nbsp;letters in that word. The reason for this is supposed to be that&nbsp;G’d created the universe by using this letter. What is meant&nbsp;by this? Israel is one amongst 70 nations, the number of&nbsp;nations are one seventieth of the number of beasts that&nbsp;populate the earth. The number of four-legged red blooded&nbsp;beasts on earth are one seventieth of the number of species&nbsp;of birds. The species of birds amount to one seventieth of the&nbsp;species of fish, which in turn are one seventieth of the&nbsp;number of different malignant forces, evil spirits, which in turn&nbsp;are one seventieth of the number of angels in heaven. The&nbsp;Lord G’d, presides over all of these creatures as the sole&nbsp;ruler. This is what the liturgist referred to when in his poem&nbsp;entitled ראשית. (No source provided)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'שמע ישראל וגו</span><span class="font5">, you are to listen in order to understand that G’d -in respect to the aggadah quoted- He is One, and&nbsp;no one preceded Him. He will remain thus, as He is eternal,&nbsp;the same G’d that existed even prior to the dawn of the&nbsp;universe. In all respects He is אחד, one, i.e. unique, not part&nbsp;of a twosome or threesome. No such self sufficient Being&nbsp;exists in His universe. Neither is there ever going to be a&nbsp;Being comparable to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of this verse: all the nations have claimed this Being as their household god. Now that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jewish people have claimed Him as theirs, it has become known throughout the world that He is our G’d, seeing that&nbsp;He communicates with us directly. If the Torah instead of&nbsp;writing as it did, had only written: ה' אלוקינו אחד, “the Lord our&nbsp;G’d is unique,” this uniqueness would have been perceived&nbsp;as restricted to His nation Israel, just like </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font5"> each worship&nbsp;their own national deity. They would have said so even more&nbsp;if the Torah had only written: שמע ישראל אלוקינו אחד, “hear&nbsp;Israel our G’d is One.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בכל לבבך</span><span class="font5">, “with all your heart;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the reason that the word is written with two successive letters&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ב </span><span class="font5">is that G’d wishes to be loved even by our “evil urge,” not&nbsp;only by our urge to do good. After all, we each only have one&nbsp;heart so it should have been spelled .לבך</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובכל מאדך</span><span class="font5">. The word מאד always describes an intensity, extremity. Moses asks us to love G’d with the utmost&nbsp;intensity we are capable of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיו הדברים האלה</span><span class="font5">, “and these words.....shall remain”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">seeing that Moses had said previously that we should love G’d, and he had not added any adjective describing the kind&nbsp;of love he had in mind, he adds additional dimensions,&nbsp;primarily the fact that this should be a steadfast, constant&nbsp;feeling of love for Him. If it is, we will doubtless get to know&nbsp;Him better. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וקשרתם לאות על ידך, </span><span class="font5">“you are to bind them (these&nbsp;words) on your hand;” in a single wrapping and a single knot.&nbsp;On the other hand, the phylacteries to be worn on your head,&nbsp;will have the shape of טוטפות, “frontlets worn between your&nbsp;eyes on your forehead,” i.e. four separate sections, as&nbsp;explained by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על ידך</span><span class="font5">, “on your hand;” all over your hand and arm. Your left hand is referred to as יד, when no adjective is added.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.9. וכתבתם על מזוזות ביתך ובשעריך, </span><span class="font5">“you shall inscribe them on the doorposts of your house and of your gates.” This&nbsp;is so that you will remember the fact that the Lord your G’d is&nbsp;One and unique, both when you enter your house and when&nbsp;you leave it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Yitzchok, in commenting on the words: “you shall affix it (some of the blood of the Passover lamb) to the two&nbsp;upright posts and the lintel of your house,” (Exodus 12,7)&nbsp;comments that from here we learn that every time the Torah&nbsp;uses the term מזוזות, it refers to either one of the side posts,&nbsp;except when the word is spelled with a second letter ו.&nbsp;(Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot</span><span class="font5"> folio 33) He views the two side-posts of the door as a simile for a human being’s two&nbsp;shoulders. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mezuzzah,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. the parchment scroll&nbsp;containing the text of the commandment, is to be affixed at&nbsp;the lower end of the upper third of that post, at shoulder&nbsp;height of a person of average height. It is affixed at an angle&nbsp;the upper part of it pointing toward the outside of the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על מזוזות ביתך</span><span class="font5">. The word ביתך, can also be a reminder of ביאתך, “where you enter.” It will be on the right side of the&nbsp;person entering the house, so that it matches the right foot&nbsp;with which one enters one’s house first. (Compare folio 34, of&nbsp;the tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot</span><span class="font5"> quoted before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובשעריך</span><span class="font5">, “and upon your gates.” This word is used as an alternate expression for “your house.” Just as your </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">house</span><span class="font5"> is a&nbsp;status symbol, so the entrance to any part of your residence&nbsp;that is a status symbol requires to have a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mezzuzah.</span><span class="font5"> This&nbsp;excludes the toilets, the bathroom, and other places which&nbsp;instead of being status symbols, are reminders of what we&nbsp;have in common with the lower forms of life, the animals.&nbsp;[When Moses was commanded to meet Pharaoh at the edge&nbsp;of the Nile, where he would excrete, unseen, as he made&nbsp;believe that being a deity he never had to excrete, G’d&nbsp;wanted to remind him that He was aware of this sham.&nbsp;(Exodus 7,15. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,12. מבית עבדים</span><span class="font5">, “out of the house of bondage.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">comments on this unusual phrase [surely the Israelites had&nbsp;not only been liberated from a house, Ed.] that the word&nbsp;“house” here is to be understood as “any place containing&nbsp;Israelites as slaves.” If you were to point out that in Exodus&nbsp;20,2 where the expression מבית עבדים occurs again, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">comments that while in Egypt the Jews were slaves of&nbsp;Pharaoh, not of every Egyptian householder, and that since&nbsp;their liberation the Israelites had become instead of slaves of&nbsp;a mortal king who himself was subject to G’d, not truly free,&nbsp;from then on they had secured for themselves to be slaves&nbsp;only to the king of Kings, the Lord G’d. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> distinguishes&nbsp;between לעבדים </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,</span><span class="font5">בית עבדים ,עבדים, and מבית עבדים.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,13. ובשמו תשבע</span><span class="font5">, “and (only) in His name may you&nbsp;pronounce any oaths.” Make sure that when you do swear,&nbsp;that everyone who hears you knows that you are using only&nbsp;His name. When others make you take an oath, do not&nbsp;violate that oath, as you have sworn in His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כאשר נסיתם במסה</span><span class="font5">, “as you have tried Him at&nbsp;Massah,” The letter ב in the word במסה, has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">under it, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Massah</span><span class="font5"> is the name of a place. At that place, the&nbsp;Israelites had questioned whether the Lord is in their midst or&nbsp;not (Exodus 17,7).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועדותיו</span><span class="font5">, “and His testimonies.” This is a reference&nbsp;not to violate negative commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,20. אשר צוה ה׳ אלוקינו אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “which the Lord our G’d commanded you.” When the Torah spoke of the questions&nbsp;raised by the intelligent son (according to the author of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Haggadah shel Pessach</span><span class="font5"> who identifies him by quoting our&nbsp;verse), he does so seeing that this son has understood that&nbsp;not all the 613 commandments belong to the same category,&nbsp;but he has subdivided them into the three categories: ,עדות&nbsp;חוקים, משפטים. When it appears at first glance as if he&nbsp;excludes himself, because he described the laws as being&nbsp;addressed to אתכם “to you,” as if he were to exclude himself,&nbsp;he hastens to say אלוקינו “our G’d,” to prevent anyone&nbsp;thinking that he excludes himself. Since he is a member of&nbsp;the second generation and had not personally heard the Ten&nbsp;Commandments at Mount Sinai, he in fact is to be&nbsp;commended for including himself, as he could have argued&nbsp;that he had not said נעשה ונשמע, “we will perform the laws as&nbsp;soon as we know what they are.” (Exodus 24.7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is in stark contrast to the “wicked son” in Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">12,26, who characterizes the laws as applying only “to you,”&nbsp;thereby excluding himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6,22. לעינינו</span><span class="font5">, “before our eyes.” We are witnesses of thi</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.24. לטוב לנו כל הימים לחיותנו כיום הזה</span><span class="font5">, “for our good, always, and to keep us alive as of this day.” In other words,&nbsp;Moses gives the Torah’s answer that we will be the ones&nbsp;inheriting כל הימים, “all the days,” i.e. also in the world of the&nbsp;future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This verse is the answer to the ridiculous philosophy of the heretics who are asking the Israelites (sarcastically) “why&nbsp;did Moses never spell out that there is such a thing as an&nbsp;afterlife, something we call: עולם הבא?” The answer to their&nbsp;question has been spelled out in our verse. The fact that in&nbsp;many other instances Moses did not spell out that this&nbsp;afterlife is the reward for living a life of Torah observance,&nbsp;and he is more concerned with their observing the&nbsp;commandments while they are alive on this earth, is because&nbsp;Moses addresses </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font5"> Jew, whether a grandfather or at the&nbsp;beginning of his adolescence. In other words, what he&nbsp;speaks about must be relevant to the nation as a whole. In&nbsp;this way he hopes to increase the awe in which each&nbsp;individual Jew relates to our G’d. For the same reason you&nbsp;have not heard him writing or speaking about </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gehinom,</span><span class="font5"> the&nbsp;domain reserved for the perpetual sinners, in which they are&nbsp;burned to a crisp, according to many other religions, and&nbsp;which will inspire them with dread of their god, not admiration&nbsp;and love, he warned them only about punishment in this life.&nbsp;(Compare the portions </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bechukotai, and ki tavo</span><span class="font5"> and a number&nbsp;of other places.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וצדקה תהיה לנו</span><span class="font5">, “and it will be a righteousness for&nbsp;us, etc;” this verse has also not been spelled out completely;&nbsp;it should have read: 'וצדקה תהיה לנו </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">לפני ה' אלוקינו</span><span class="font5"> כי נשמור וגו&nbsp;“and it will be a righteousness </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before the Lord our</span><span class="font5"> G’d, when&nbsp;we observe, etc.” in other words, Moses holds out the&nbsp;promises of a great reward for keeping the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: this sentence is an appendage to the one that commenced with the question of&nbsp;the intelligent son in verse 20. Moses assures this son that&nbsp;there will be a great reward in store for him if he observes the&nbsp;various categories of commandments in the Torah about&nbsp;which he had enquired. This reward is the encouragement to&nbsp;diligently study and observe the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תתחתן בם</span><span class="font5">, “do not intermarry with them.” The&nbsp;nations referred to are the ones mentioned in Kings I 11,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי יסיר</span><span class="font5">, “for he will turn away;” this is the son of a&nbsp;Canaanite marrying a Jewish girl, mentioned in verse three.&nbsp;The father of such a child will bring him up as a heathen,&nbsp;although legally, he is a Jew, his mother being Jewish. In the&nbsp;case of the child being a daughter, this will be even more so,&nbsp;as living as a heathen is so much easier for the children who&nbsp;do not have to observe all the commandments of the Jewish&nbsp;religion. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,7. לא מרובכם מכל העמים</span><span class="font5">, “not because you were more numerous than all the other nations;” the “other” nations&nbsp;referred to here are the seven Canaanite tribes that will be&nbsp;replaced by the Israelites shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אתם המעט מכולם</span><span class="font5">, “rather because you are the least numerous;” but it is because He loves you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.9. וידעת כי ה' אלוקין־</span><span class="font5">, “for you know that He is the Lord your G’d;” this is a continuation of the two previous verses.&nbsp;The reason why you are so certain that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> is the Lord&nbsp;your G’d is because you are aware of what He has done for&nbsp;your ancestors commencing with Avraham. He has faithfully&nbsp;kept all the promises He has given them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאלף דור</span><span class="font5">, “for up to a thousand generations.” Why did these words have to be added? Having told you that G’d&nbsp;loves you, you might think that you do not have to bother to&nbsp;keep all the commandments of His Torah, seeing that G’d is&nbsp;obligated to keep His oath to our forefathers, regardless. G’d&nbsp;is willing to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">wait</span><span class="font5"> with keeping His promises for as long as a&nbsp;thousand generations, if in the interval no generation had&nbsp;proved worthy of what He had promised to the forefathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שומר הברית</span><span class="font5">, “He keeps His covenant;” the word שומר here means: “waiting in anticipation,” as it did in Genesis&nbsp;37,11 where Yaakov was described as awaiting fulfillment of&nbsp;Joseph’s dream with the words: ואביו שמר את הדבר, “and his&nbsp;father remained in expectation of what would happen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומשלם לשונאיו אל פניו</span><span class="font5">, “and He repays them that&nbsp;hate Him to his face.” He punishes such people for their sins&nbsp;during their lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אל פניו ישלם לו</span><span class="font5">, “He pays him in his lifetime,” instead of waiting to punish his children if they continue in their father’s&nbsp;way. If they do not do so, (continue to sin) they will not be&nbsp;burdened with the sins of their fathers. This is spelled out&nbsp;clearly in Ezekiel 18,17: והוא לא ימות בעדן אביו, “but he will not&nbsp;die on account of the sin of his father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמרתם את המצוה</span><span class="font5">, “You shall therefore keep the&nbsp;commandment;” your observing His commandments will be&nbsp;appropriate as a repayment for G’d keeping His promises to&nbsp;the forefathers.”</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Eykev</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,12. והיה עקב משמעון</span><span class="font5">, “it shall come to pass as a result of your hearkening, etc;” Moses tells the people that on account&nbsp;of their observing the laws of the Torah the blessings following&nbsp;will be bestowed upon them collectively. On the other hand, if&nbsp;you do not observe His commandments He will not fulfill the&nbsp;terms of His covenant until the following generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,20. הצרעה</span><span class="font5">, “the hornet;” according to some&nbsp;interpretations this is a type of disease similar to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">afflicting the body. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7,22. לא מוכל כלומם מהר</span><span class="font5">, “you will not be able to destroy them quickly;” the word תוכל is not to be understood as an&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">inability</span><span class="font5"> on your part. It will not be in your interest to do so, as&nbsp;you would create a vacuum of not enough people in the land,&nbsp;that would encourage invasion by free roaming beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.25</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;משרפון באש</span><span class="font5">, “you are to burn them by fire.” When the&nbsp;Israelites, after seeing the golden calf, addressed it with the&nbsp;words: “these are your deities (pl) Israel!” all types of idolatries&nbsp;were included in that declaration, and there is a rule that the&nbsp;only way an idolatry practiced by a Jew can be nullified is by&nbsp;destroying the idol by burning it. (Compare Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot</span><span class="font5"> folio 53) The only other way is to reduce it to dust&nbsp;and throw the dust to the winds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פן מוקש בו</span><span class="font5">, “lest you be ensnared by it.” Sometimes one hesitates to destroy such images completely as one does not&nbsp;wish to destroy the value of the gold or silver that was part of&nbsp;it. Moses warns that by harbouring any part of it you are&nbsp;inviting disaster to befall your home and family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שקץ משקצנו</span><span class="font5">, “you are to treat it as if it were an&nbsp;abomination (regardless of its market value). The reference is&nbsp;to residual gold and silver of such deities even after they have&nbsp;been dismantled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל המצוה</span><span class="font5">, ”Every commandment,” Moses refers&nbsp;especially to the commandment not to covet the gold of the&nbsp;idolatries mentioned in verse 25 of the previous chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזכרת את כל הדרך</span><span class="font5">, “you will remember the whole trek;”&nbsp;if your heart urges you to covet the gold and silver which are&nbsp;part of the idols of these nations, I remind you of the last 40&nbsp;years in the desert when you had no need for, nor even use for&nbsp;gold and silver;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למען ענותך</span><span class="font5">, “in order to test you to see if you would revolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">התשמור מצותיו אם לא </span><span class="font5">“if you would observe His commandments or not.” Actually the term נסיין in the sense of&nbsp;a “test,” that could be passed or failed, does not exist in G’d’s&nbsp;vocabulary, seeing that He knows the result of the “test” in&nbsp;advance, being omniscient. G’d employs such “tests” in order&nbsp;to demonstrate to the attribute of justice as well as to the&nbsp;attribute of mercy the true nature of the Jewish people, as I&nbsp;have explained in my commentary on Exodus 16,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויענך </span><span class="font5">“He afflicted you,” on the way, as in Psalms&nbsp;102,24: ענה </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">בדרך</span><span class="font5"> כחי</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“He drained my strength while I was on&nbsp;the way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וירעבך</span><span class="font5">, “He starved you;” by not giving you more manna than enough for one day at a time. We have a principle that it&nbsp;is not possible to compare the state of mind of people who&nbsp;have a supply of food in their travel bag with those who, even&nbsp;though not hungry, do not have such a supply to fall back&nbsp;on.(Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma</span><span class="font5"> folio 74)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the last phrase: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וירעיבך</span><span class="font5">, if G’d would have provided you with manna while you still had&nbsp;supplies of regular food which you took out of Egypt with you,&nbsp;you would not even have bothered to taste it in order to see if&nbsp;you liked it. This is why He waited until you were hungry, after&nbsp;having exhausted your supplies. You then had no option but to&nbsp;eat what G’d had provided for you. Seeing that this was&nbsp;something totally unknown to you or to your forefathers, G’d&nbsp;had to “starve” you in order to have you accept His food. [We&nbsp;know how often the people treated the manna as something&nbsp;lacking substance, and they even dubbed it as לחם הקלקל,”&nbsp;(Numbers 21,8). Ed,]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שמלתך לא בלתה</span><span class="font5">, “your garments did not wear out;” this&nbsp;is relevant to chapter 7 verse 25, where matters you should&nbsp;not covet have been discussed. Although you have travelled a&nbsp;long distance in the desert, for almost forty years, G’d has&nbsp;made certain that your clothing did not need replacing. When&nbsp;you observe G’d’s commandments, you will not need all the&nbsp;things that ordinary people require in order to live on this earth&nbsp;comfortably. If He was able to look after you in an&nbsp;uninhabitable desert, how much more so can He look after you&nbsp;in habitable areas of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ה</span><span class="font5">' </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלוקיך מיסרך, </span><span class="font5">“the Lord your G’d chastens you. By&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font5"> providing you with a food supply sufficient for a week or&nbsp;even longer, so that you will be afraid to rebel against Him for&nbsp;fear He might withhold your food, He has succeeded in making&nbsp;you a chastened nation.” Only the feeling that one can exist&nbsp;independently of G’d results in one’s rebelling against the&nbsp;Torah laws. He has taught you to be dependent on His&nbsp;largesse daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,7</span><span class="font5">. כי ה׳ אלוקיך מביאך, “for the Lord your G’d is about to&nbsp;bring you to a good land;” seeing it provides your needs in&nbsp;abundance, there is a danger that you might forget Him and&nbsp;imagine that you can manage on your own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יוצאי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בבקעה ובהר, </span><span class="font5">“springing forth both in the valleys and in the mountainous regions.” This makes it unnecessary for the&nbsp;people dwelling in the mountainous regions to have to&nbsp;descend to the valleys in order to secure their needs, i.e. their&nbsp;water supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תחסר כל בה</span><span class="font5">, “you shall not lack for anything in it.”&nbsp;Whatever grows in that land will grow in abundance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואכלת ושבעת וגו</span><span class="font5">׳, “you will eat and be satisfied;” this&nbsp;verse is the one from which the sages derived the first three&nbsp;blessings in the prayer known as ברכת המזון, saying grace after&nbsp;meals. The three pertinent words are: ואכלת-ושבעת- וברכת “when&nbsp;you have eaten and been satisfied you are to say grace.” The&nbsp;first blessing concludes with the words: הזן את הכל. “He Who&nbsp;gives food to all.” The word את in the line: את ה׳ אלוקיך; this is a&nbsp;reference to the owner of the house in which you have&nbsp;consumed this food, i.e. your host.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על הארץ, </span><span class="font5">“for the land; this is a reference to the paragraph in our grace which commences with the words: נודה לך, “let us&nbsp;give thanks to You.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הטובה אשר נתן לך, </span><span class="font5">“the good one that He gave to you.” This is a reference to the third paragraph in which we ask G’d to&nbsp;rebuild Jerusalem, compare Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 5.&nbsp;After a person has sated himself, and is revolted by seeing&nbsp;more food, he is obligated to pronounce these benedictions. If&nbsp;this is so, it follows automatically, without having to be spelled&nbsp;out, that when he is hungry and sits down to a meal that he will&nbsp;bless the Lord Who has provided it directly or indirectly. He&nbsp;does so by reciting the line concluding with the words: המוציא&nbsp;לחם מן הארץ, “Who has caused the earth to produce “bread,”&nbsp;i.e. food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואכלת ושבעת וברכת</span><span class="font5">, “these words are also a hint that when three people share a meal, they add an additional blessing to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,.</span><span class="font5"> זימון.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">8,14. ורם לבבך ושכחת</span><span class="font5">, “and your heart feels superior, as a result of which you will forget” (the Lord and His largesse).&nbsp;Moses had warned against such a phenomenon already in&nbsp;verse 11. The phenomenon of becoming haughty is tragically&nbsp;all too common.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,1. אתה עובר היום</span><span class="font5">, “you are crossing this day;” this is not&nbsp;to be understood literally, but means: “in the immediate future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of these words: “you are being considered as if crossing the Jordan already on this day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,7. אשר הקצפת במדבר</span><span class="font5">, “how you made the Lord your G’d angry in the desert;” this occurred already immediately after&nbsp;the people had broken camp after over 11 months at Mount&nbsp;Sinai. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,9. בעלותי ההרה</span><span class="font5">, “while I ascended the Mountain.” This&nbsp;occurred on the first day of the week, immediately after the&nbsp;revelation on the Sabbath the day before, the seventh day of&nbsp;the month of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואשב בהר ארבעים וארבעים לילה</span><span class="font5">, “I remained on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,17. ואשברם לעיניכם</span><span class="font5">, “I smashed them in front of your eyes.” I did this in order not to make you guilty of transgressing&nbsp;the laws written thereon. It was written on them that you are&nbsp;not to have other deities, and you had made a golden calf for&nbsp;yourselves.</span></p><h1 dir="rtl"><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font5">!”,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואתנפל לפני ה' כראשונה ארבעים יום וארבעים לילה .9,18</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">prostrated myself before the Lord, as previously, for forty days and forty nights. This verse does not refer to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">commentary here that G’d responded to Moses with the words:&nbsp;סלחתי כדבריך, “I have forgiven, in accordance with your words,”&nbsp;alludes to Moses’ second ascent to obtain forgiveness after&nbsp;the sin of the golden calf.(Exodus 32,30.) That quote is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">own words, for on the seventeenth of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tammus</span><span class="font5"> during the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">first&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">year of the Exodus Moses returned up to the Mountain in order&nbsp;to obtain forgiveness for the sin of the golden calf. The spies&nbsp;had not been dispatched until the twenty ninth day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sivan</span><span class="font5"> in&nbsp;the second year of their wanderings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כראשונה</span><span class="font5">, “as originally;” this word does not refer to the word: “I prostrated myself;” it could not have done, as he had&nbsp;not previously asked G’d to forgive the sin of the golden calf. It&nbsp;simply refers to a period of forty days and forty nights. Moses&nbsp;makes the point that he had had to stay on the Mountain&nbsp;without food or drink twice on two separate occasions. This&nbsp;had occurred the first time when he had ascended the&nbsp;Mountain of the seventh day of Sivan in order to obtain the first&nbsp;set of commandments. The ascent in order to secure the&nbsp;forgiveness for the sin of the golden calf commenced on the&nbsp;eighteenth day of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tammus,</span><span class="font5"> a Thursday, and he returned at the&nbsp;beginning of the night of the twenty ninth day of the month of&nbsp;Av. During those 40 days he had prayed in his own tent, the&nbsp;one he had erected outside the camp, as G’d had made&nbsp;Himself inaccessible to prayer inside the confines of the camp,&nbsp;as I have explained in my commentary on Exodus 32,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9,19. גם בפעם ההיא</span><span class="font5">, “also on that occasion.” He had already prayed for them at the sea of reeds, (Exodus 14,15) at&nbsp;Marah (15,25) and at Massah.(Exodus 17,4)</span></p>

(Numbers 11,3.) Seeing that this place&nbsp;had two names, Moses mentions both of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ואתנפל לפני ה</span><span class="font5">, “I threw myself down before the&nbsp;Lord;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> these are the same forty days of&nbsp;which Moses had spoken already in verse 18. His proof is that&nbsp;he himself wrote: “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">the</span><span class="font5"> forty days and nights,” i.e. the ones&nbsp;referred to already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.26. 'ואמר ה, </span><span class="font5">Moses uses G’d’s attribute spelled with the&nbsp;letters </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aleph dalet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">9.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומשנאתו אותם</span><span class="font5">, “or because of His hatred for them;”&nbsp;the letter ו at the beginning of the word ומשנאתו is to be&nbsp;understood as if the Torah had written: או, “or.” We have&nbsp;numerous occasions where the letter ו means “or,” for instance&nbsp;in Exodus 12,5: מן הכבשים, “or from amongst the sheep;” or in&nbsp;Exodus 21,17: ומכה אביו ואמו, “or if someone strikes his father&nbsp;or his mother,” to mention just a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.1</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בעת ההיא</span><span class="font5">, “at that time;” on the night of the twenty&nbsp;ninth of Av;” this is a reference to Exodus 34,1, when G’d said&nbsp;to Moses to that he was to carve out stones for the second set&nbsp;of Tablets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארון עץ</span><span class="font5">, “an ark made of wood.” There is disagreement among the sages in the Jerusalem Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shekalim,&nbsp;chapter six halachah</span><span class="font5"> 1, if this refers to a single ark or to two.&nbsp;The latter opinion holds that one of these arks was to contain&nbsp;the Torah scroll, and the other was to contain the second set&nbsp;of Tablets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמתם בארון</span><span class="font5">, “you shall put them inside the ark.”&nbsp;You shall not carry them in your hands so that you will not&nbsp;have an opportunity to smash them in a fit of anger, as you did&nbsp;with the last ones. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואעל ההרה</span><span class="font5">, “I ascended the Mountain.” This was at&nbsp;dawn on Thursday the twenty ninth day of Av. This ascent has&nbsp;been referred to in Exodus 34,4, where the Torah reported&nbsp;Moses ascending early in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויתנם ה׳ אלי</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord handed them to me.” This&nbsp;was on the Tuesday, the tenth day of the month of Tishrey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואפן וארד מן ההר</span><span class="font5">, “I turned around and descended&nbsp;from the Mountain;” on the same day, on Tuesday, the tenth&nbsp;day of Tishrey. This is what is written in Exodus 34,29: ויהי&nbsp;ברדת משה מן ההר, “it happened while Moses was on his descent&nbsp;from the Mountain, etc.;” even though Moses had delayed&nbsp;briefly on the Mountain, he descended on that day and brought&nbsp;the second set of Tablets with him. This day is not included in&nbsp;the three times 40 days that Moses had spent on the&nbsp;Mountain. Those forty das had already been completed at&nbsp;dawn of the day that Moses descended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses’ absences from the people, and his fasting, therefore commenced on Monday, the first day of Sivan, prior&nbsp;to the revelation on the sixth day of the month, as he had to&nbsp;completely discharge any remnants of food and drink&nbsp;consumed before he ascended the Mountain where he had to&nbsp;be comparable to angels who do not eat or drink. He therefore</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">could remain in a constant state of ritual purity. He completed his fasting on Monday the ninth day of Tishrey. This is why it&nbsp;became a custom among some of our people to observe&nbsp;Mondays and Thursdays commencing with the first day of&nbsp;Sivan and concluding on the tenth day of TIishrey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,6. ובני ישראל נסעו מבארות בני יעקן</span><span class="font5">, “after Aaron had died at the beginning of the fortieth year the Children of Israel and&nbsp;journeyed from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Yaakon,</span><span class="font5"> etc;” you should not assume&nbsp;that Aaron died at the beginning of the fortieth year and that&nbsp;Moses prayer therefore did not help him at all. The fact is that&nbsp;he died nearer the end of that year at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hor hahar,</span><span class="font5"> at the time&nbsp;when the Israelites had come from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bney Yaakon,</span><span class="font5"> to which&nbsp;they had come from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mosserah,</span><span class="font5"> as we find in Numbers </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">33,30.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">From there the people proceeded to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hor Hahar.</span><span class="font5"> This is where&nbsp;Aaron died, and not at the time in the first year when the&nbsp;people had worshipped the golden calf. [The assumption that&nbsp;he died then is contradicted by the Torah so many times, that it&nbsp;is not even worth denying. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,8. בעת ההיא הבדיל ה' את שבט הלוי</span><span class="font5">, “at that time the Lord set the tribe of Levi apart;” this decree was issued while the&nbsp;people were still encamped around Mount Sinai. Moses acted&nbsp;upon that decree only after the Tabernacle had been erected,&nbsp;and it had assumed practical meaning. This would have been&nbsp;a number of months after he had received these instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,10. גם בפעם ההוא, “</span><span class="font5">also on that occasion.” He did so with a friendly mien. He did so in order that the Holy name&nbsp;should not become desecrated, as I had said in my prayer.&nbsp;(Deut. 9.28) However, once you will have defeated the thirty&nbsp;one Canaanite kings and you have taken over their land, if you&nbsp;would commence to sin again, even my prayers would not&nbsp;help, as in the meantime G’d had demonstrated that He had&nbsp;kept His part of the bargain, i.e. that He had not been too weak&nbsp;to overcome those nations. The people then would ask why&nbsp;disaster had overtaken the Jews (Compare Deut.29,23) and&nbsp;they would conclude that it had been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">their</span><span class="font5"> fault, not that of their&nbsp;G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כימים הראשונים</span><span class="font5">, “as on the first occasion;” forty days and nights on each occasion, from dawn on the twenty ninth of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Av&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">until dawn on the tenth of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tishrey</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,11. קום, לך למסע, </span><span class="font5">“arise go to make the people go;” this is a reminder of Exodus 32,34: נחה את העם, “lead the nation!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,15. ויבחר בזרעם אחריהם, בכם</span><span class="font5">, He chose their seeds after them, i.e. “whom did He choose” “you;” this is the meaning of&nbsp;the verse, as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains, based on the prefix ב in the word&nbsp;בכם. You, i.e. your generation, are the generation of the&nbsp;patriarchs’ seed that He has chosen. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> focuses on the&nbsp;words: כיום הזה, “as of now,” at the end of our verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.20. את ה' אלוקיך תירא</span><span class="font5">, “You shall fear the Lord your G’d;” This is a warning not to transgress negative&nbsp;commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אותו תעבוד</span><span class="font5">, “Him you shall serve!” This refers to observance of the positive commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובו תדבק</span><span class="font5">, “and to Him you shall cleave!” With your </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">heart</span><span class="font5">;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of this phrase: seeing that Moses had earlier told the people about some of G’d’s ways of doing&nbsp;things, he adds now that we should emulate what we have&nbsp;learned about how G’d does things. In the portion of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vaetchanan</span><span class="font5"> he had not said anything about specific ways in&nbsp;which G’d operates, (Deut. 6,13) this is why he elaborates&nbsp;here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובשמו תשבע</span><span class="font5">, “and by His name you shall swear.” This refers to your </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mouth</span><span class="font5">, as opposed to your heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask that the third commandment of the Ten Commandments had indicated that oaths should be used very&nbsp;sparingly, that is quite true; however, if the need to swear an&nbsp;oath arises you must make sure to swear only by His name.&nbsp;Such situations are primarily when you are tempted to commit&nbsp;a transgression, and you use your oath to stop yourself from&nbsp;giving in to that temptation. (Compare Ruth 3,13 where Boaz&nbsp;did so according to the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">T’murah</span><span class="font5"> folio 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הוא תהלתך</span><span class="font5">, “He is your glory;” you are to boast&nbsp;about having Him as your G’d, as will be explained forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,2. ואשר לא ראו את מוסר</span><span class="font5">, “and who have not witnessed Your chastisement;” Moses will furnish the details immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואשר עשה לחיל מצרי</span><span class="font5">ם, “and what He did to the army&nbsp;of Egypt;” Moses adds in verse 6, that G’d had killed Datan&nbsp;and Aviram. These two actions do not appear to be related to&nbsp;one another, neither in the manner in which either party met its&nbsp;death, nor in the quantity of people involved in each action.&nbsp;Why did Moses treat them in such a manner? He wished to&nbsp;demonstrate how both the earth and the ocean collaborated&nbsp;with G’d. The Egyptians did not drown in the regular manner&nbsp;but the waves piled up upon them forcing them below. In the&nbsp;case of Datan and Aviram, though they stood far away from&nbsp;Korach, they were also swallowed by the earth which strained&nbsp;to carry out what it perceived to be G’d’s will. Onkelos pays&nbsp;tribute to the astuteness with which nature cooperated with&nbsp;G’d, i.e. חכימא מיא, “the waters acted with wisdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואשר עשה לכ</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במדבר</span><span class="font5">, “and what He did for you in the&nbsp;desert;” this is a reference to the manna. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת בתיה</span><span class="font5">ם, “and their houses.” Wives, children, and&nbsp;their young infants went to their deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,8. למען תחזקו</span><span class="font5">, “in order that you will remain strong;”&nbsp;Moses does not mean that the commandments should be&nbsp;performed in order to strengthen the Israelites’ bodies; it is&nbsp;never recommended that we serve the Lord for the sake of&nbsp;reward on this earth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Avot,</span><span class="font5"> 1,3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What he meant was that performance of the commandments as a whole punctiliously, would ensure that&nbsp;their stay on the ancestral land they were about to be given&nbsp;would endure for many years. (verse 9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,10. 'כי הארץ אשר אתה בא שמה וגו </span><span class="font5">:”for the land that you are about to come to, etc.; ”the nature of that land requires that&nbsp;you observe G’d’s commandments. This land is not like Egypt&nbsp;where all the farmer had to do was to plant the seed and&nbsp;nature would take over automatically, as the Nile would irrigate&nbsp;the seedlings and the crops would grow. Therefore:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה א</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תשמעו</span><span class="font5">. “It will be as a result of your hearkening, etc, I will direct My rain to the land that needs it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא כארץ מצרי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">היא</span><span class="font5">, “it is not like the land of Egypt;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">explains as follows: Cham, Noach’s youngest son had built</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tzoan in Egypt and Chevron in Canaan. When </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">commented on Genesis 12,6, that the Canaanite was still living&nbsp;in that land, it means that the Canaanites at that time were in&nbsp;the process of capturing that land from Shem, Cham’s older&nbsp;brother. They did so by proceeding from the north of the land,&nbsp;which had been part of Shem’s ancestral land and that of his&nbsp;descendants. The lower, i.e. more southerly part of what is&nbsp;now the land of Israel had belonged to Cham. Chevron&nbsp;belonged to that part of the land of Canaan. This too has been&nbsp;explained by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ארץ הרים ובקעות</span><span class="font5">, “a land of hills and valleys.” No&nbsp;one was able to irrigate his fields by drawing on the waters&nbsp;from the rivers. Seeing that you will depend on rainfall at the&nbsp;appropriate season, you will do well to observe the&nbsp;commandments properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;דורש אותה</span><span class="font5">, “He cares for it constantly;” He&nbsp;examines the people’s morals in that land especially carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מרשית השנה, </span><span class="font5">“from the beginning of the year;” the word ראשית appears here without the customary letter .א</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועד אחרית שנה</span><span class="font5">, right until the end of the year. He is entitled to bless the fruit of the land even after it has reached their&nbsp;storage places in their homes. We know that from the promise&nbsp;in Deut. 28,8, יצו ה׳ את הברכה באסמיך, “the Lord will command&nbsp;the blessing in your barns.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,14. ואספת דגנך</span><span class="font5">, “you will gather in your grain harvest.” You have permission to go about your business in the full&nbsp;meaning of the word. [not as in the desert when your bread&nbsp;came down from heaven and you were totally free to devote&nbsp;yourselves to Torah study. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,16. פן יפתה לבבכם</span><span class="font5">, “lest your heart be fooled;” the root פתה appears in this sense in Job 5,2: “passion slays the fool.”&nbsp;Moses warns the people not to be misled by the urges of their&nbsp;heart and commit foolishness. If the root of this word would be&nbsp;פתוי, “temptation,” Moses should have written: יפותה, as in&nbsp;Proverbs 25,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועבדתם אלהים אחרים, </span><span class="font5">“you will worship other deities.” Rabbi Yossi queries why these deities are called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font5"> in the Torah&nbsp;seeing that they are idols. Our author dealt with this problem&nbsp;already in his commentary on Exodus 20,3, the main point of&nbsp;which was that the translation “other gods,” is incorrect, and it&nbsp;should be translated as: “deities” worshipped by others.”&nbsp;According to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> on the word אחרים, that word could be&nbsp;translated as “exchangeable,” if the owner of a golden idol&nbsp;finds himself hard up, he will sell the golden one and exchange&nbsp;it for something similar made of silver, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואבדתם</span><span class="font5">, “you will become lost,” the reference is to&nbsp;exile, similar to when the prophet Isaiah 27,13 refers to the&nbsp;exiles from Ashur returning to their homeland as האובדים בארץ&nbsp;אשור, “the ones who were lost in the land of Ashur.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על לבבכם</span><span class="font5">, “in your hearts;” the word על usually&nbsp;translated as “on, above, etc.,” also appears quite a few times&nbsp;as meaning “next to, beside,” the author cites Exodus 40,3 as&nbsp;an example where the Torah writes: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וסכותה על הארון</span><span class="font5">, which is&nbsp;translated as: “you shall screen the ark,” i.e. the dividing&nbsp;curtain before or beside the Holy of Holies screens the Ark&nbsp;from view. In our verse the meaning would be that G’d’s word&nbsp;shall always be close to our hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,21. למען ירבו ימיכם וימי בניכם</span><span class="font5">, “so that you will live long and your children will live long, etc..” Women are also&nbsp;obligated to put </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mezzuzot</span><span class="font5"> on their homes when no man shares&nbsp;the home they live in. This is logical, seeing that they too wish&nbsp;to enjoy long life. (Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kidushin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 31.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כ</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">י אם שמור תשמרון</span><span class="font5">, “for if you diligently keep all these commandments;” the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי </span><span class="font5">is used here instead of the word:&nbsp;אלא, “but.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואבדתם מהרה</span><span class="font5">, “if you do not keep the commandments now, you will not have to go into exile as you will not even&nbsp;enter the Holy land in the first place. The condition for entering&nbsp;is that you have a record of keeping the laws of the Torah.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Re-ay.</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11,26. ראה אנכי נותן לפניכם</span><span class="font5">, “Behold, I set before you;” up until now Moses had concentrated on the need to revere the&nbsp;Lord; from now on he concentrates on spelling out specific&nbsp;commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתתה את הברכה</span><span class="font5">, “you shall set the blessing;”&nbsp;verbally, as the author has explained in Deuteronomy 27,1114; example: Leviticus 16,21: ונתן אותם על ראש השעיר, “he will&nbsp;place them on the head of the he-goat” (the sins of Israel).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על הר גריזים</span><span class="font5">, “next to Mount Gerizim.” The word על meaning “next to,” is also used in this sense in Exodus 40, 3&nbsp;וסכות על הארון, “you shall screen the ark.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">11.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אחרי דרך מבא השמש</span><span class="font5">, “behind the way of the going&nbsp;down of the sun.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary on this phrase is that&nbsp;the people travelled a tremendous distance on that day.&nbsp;According to the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah,</span><span class="font5"> folio 36, the&nbsp;Israelites on that day, after having crossed the river Jordan,&nbsp;would have marched 60 miles both to and back to Mount&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gerizim</span><span class="font5"> and Mount </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eyval</span><span class="font5"> having performed all the&nbsp;commandments they were to perform there, also on that day.&nbsp;They would then have spent the night at Gilgal as detailed in&nbsp;Joshua 8,30-35 as well as in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah 36.</span><span class="font5"> [I am not sure if our&nbsp;author questions the literal meaning of the Talmud&nbsp;concerning this. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מול הגלגל</span><span class="font5">, “facing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gilgal;”</span><span class="font5"> The reason why Moses pinpoints the location is because the chain of mountains is&nbsp;long, and Moses wished to give precise directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,1. אלה החוקים</span><span class="font5">, “these are the statutes;” whenever the Torah commences a paragraph with the word אלה, this&nbsp;means that what follows is not a continuation in some form of&nbsp;what had preceded it. In this case too, the subject of the&nbsp;function of the two mountains </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gerizim</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eyval</span><span class="font5"> are not&nbsp;connected to what follows. The commandment to be&nbsp;performed on or near these mountains, were one time only&nbsp;commandments. The places near there on which the gentiles&nbsp;had worshipped idols had to be totally destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אבד תאבדון את כל המקומות, </span><span class="font5">“you are to utterly&nbsp;destroy all the sites, etc.; ”the Torah here speaks of vessels&nbsp;used in the worship of idols, [not the earth itself on which the&nbsp;idol stands. Ed.] Besides, it is impossible to forbid the surface&nbsp;of the earth for use, as if so, the idolaters would be able to&nbsp;turn all habitable surfaces on the globe into forbidden areas.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אלהיהם על ההרים</span><span class="font5">, “their deities on the mountains;” our sages explain that they had not turned the mountains&nbsp;themselves into deities. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri</span><span class="font5"> )</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אלהיהם</span><span class="font5">, “this word has the letter ו missing after the letter ל.” In this way it is a continuation of the line: “upon&nbsp;which the gentile nations had served their idols.” The&nbsp;paragraph is a commandment to remove and destroy all idols&nbsp;everywhere the Canaanites had worshipped such so-called&nbsp;deities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתצתם את מזבחותם</span><span class="font5">, “you shall break down all their&nbsp;altars;” the phrase is a repetition as it is needed for the other&nbsp;half, the commandment to wipe out the names of these&nbsp;deities, (at the end of the verse).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואשריהם תשרפון באש</span><span class="font5">, “and burn their </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">asherim</span><span class="font5"> by fire.” In Deuteronomy 7,5, the Torah instructed that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">asherim&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">ought to be hewn down, מגדעון. Our sages explain this&nbsp;difference by saying that if these trees had been planted&nbsp;before they had been worshipped whatever had grown after&nbsp;that has to be cut down. If they had been planted after on&nbsp;that site idolatry had already been practiced, the entire tree&nbsp;or trees have to be burned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ופסילי אלהיהם תגדעון</span><span class="font5">, “and the graven images of their deities you must cut down. In Deuteronomy 7,5, we read that&nbsp;ופסיליהם תשרפו באש, “and their carved images you must burn.”&nbsp;This refers to these images having been carved into the trunk&nbsp;of the tree while the tree was still planted in the earth. If a&nbsp;figure had been carved into the trunk after it had been cut&nbsp;down, you must burn the whole trunk of that tree. If he had&nbsp;cut down the image without burning the tree, the tree may&nbsp;remain standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the differing methods for destroying symbols of paganism: in both instances </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">either&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">cutting down such symbols or burning them is the&nbsp;appropriate method of destroying them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואשריהם תשרפון באש</span><span class="font5">, “and their existing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">asherim</span><span class="font5"> you must burn by fire.” Seeing that the Holy Land had been&nbsp;designated as belonging to Israel by G’d, and at the time&nbsp;when the Israelites had said at the time of the golden calf:&nbsp;“these are your deities O Israel,” they yearned for a&nbsp;multiplicity of deities. As a result of this outcry, all the various&nbsp;deities served in the land of Canaan became partially owned&nbsp;by the Israelites. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> folio 63) Idols&nbsp;owned by Israelites can never be utterly annulled. (Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Avodah Zarah</span><span class="font5"> folio 53) They must be destroyed&nbsp;utterly beyond any recognition physically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואבדתם את שמם</span><span class="font5">, “you must abolish their names, even.” (Compare Numbers 32,38, their names had been changed)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,4. לא תעשון כן</span><span class="font5">, “You shall not do likewise, etc.” you cannot serve the Lord your G’d and sacrifice offerings to Him&nbsp;at any place that you choose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אם אל המקום אשר יבחר</span><span class="font5">, “except at a place of Hjs choosing.” Moses did not spell out the name of that place,&nbsp;seeing that at different times G’d’s Presence decides to&nbsp;accept homage at different locations. [but never at more than&nbsp;one place at a given time. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואכלתם שם </span><span class="font5">“ you will eat there;” this is a reference&nbsp;to the priests and the Levites. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אתם ובתיכם</span><span class="font5">, “you and your household members.” The word: “and the Levite,” has not been repeated here seeing&nbsp;that this paragraph had been addressed to the Israelites&nbsp;before the land had been distributed to the other tribes, and&nbsp;the Israelites had not yet been warned to give the Levite his&nbsp;due. However, later on, in verse 10, when Moses speaks of&nbsp;the period after the distribution of the land has taken place,&nbsp;as the period in which they will enjoy peace and security, the&nbsp;Torah does warn the Israelite not to neglect the Levites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תעשון ככל אשר אנחנו עושים פה היום</span><span class="font5">, “You are not&nbsp;to act as we are in the habit of doing here at this time;” the&nbsp;Torah connects the prohibition of offering sacrifices on&nbsp;private altars to the building of a central Temple; the reason&nbsp;is that such a Temple cannot be built until all the parts of the&nbsp;country have been conquered. Until such time the people&nbsp;would be afraid to absent themselves for longer periods from&nbsp;their homes for fear of encouraging attacks by the enemy.&nbsp;The Torah therefore links worship at a central Temple to&nbsp;feeling secure from attacks by potential enemies. Such a&nbsp;situation would not arise until four hundred years after the&nbsp;wars fought by Joshua, when we read in Samuel II 7,1 that&nbsp;David told the prophet Natan, that he felt the time had come&nbsp;to provide G’d with a permanent home (in Jerusalem). [We&nbsp;are told in Kings I 6,1 that Solomon’s Temple was not built&nbsp;until four hundred and eighty years after the Exodus from&nbsp;Egypt. David had told the prophet that he felt secure enough&nbsp;to undertake the building of a permanent Temple, seeing that&nbsp;he had vanquished all the enemies surrounding the land of&nbsp;Israel. While agreeing with that statement, the actual building&nbsp;was delayed so that a king who had not had to fight </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">wars</span><span class="font5">, i.e.&nbsp;his son Solomon, would be the symbol of peace, the symbol&nbsp;of G’d’s rule on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">איש כל הישר בעיניו</span><span class="font5">, “everyone whatsoever was right in his eyes;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> is at pains to make sure that we do not&nbsp;understand these words literally, but that it refers to offering&nbsp;sacrifices in his backyard, instead of bringing the animals&nbsp;concerned to the Tabernacle or its successor, such as Shiloh&nbsp;where a permanent structure, but without a solid roof,&nbsp;functioned as the central place of worship for over three&nbsp;hundred and fifty years. The fact that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> is correct is&nbsp;proved, when in verse fourteen, Moses spells out that all&nbsp;sacrifices will have to be offered in a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">place</span><span class="font5"> designated by G’d&nbsp;Himself, or they would not be welcome, and the person doing&nbsp;so would instead be punished with the most severe&nbsp;punishment available, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">karet,</span><span class="font5"> being excised posthumously&nbsp;from membership in the Jewish people. (Leviticus 17,9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,9. אל המנוחה</span><span class="font5">, “to the rest;” you will not experience&nbsp;such a feeling until your enemies all around you have been&nbsp;thoroughly defeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואל הנחלה</span><span class="font5">, “and to the inheritance;” this will not be the case until after you have crossed the Jordan and have taken&nbsp;possession of the west bank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,13. השמר לך פן תעלה עולותיך בכל מקו</span><span class="font5">ם, “Take heed not&nbsp;to offer your burnt offerings at any place;” the reason why the&nbsp;Torah is so insistent that offerings not be brought other than&nbsp;at a central location, is that seeing the Israelites are&nbsp;supposed to make at least three pilgrimages a year to the&nbsp;Temple in Jerusalem, if they were legally able to offer the&nbsp;sacrifices that they need to offer also on private altars, many&nbsp;would use that as an excuse not to make the pilgrimages to&nbsp;Jerusalem. Once they would get into the habit to offer&nbsp;sacrifices to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> on private altars, it would be a small&nbsp;step to also offer some sacrifices, such as calves, to other&nbsp;“deities.” [As we saw once Jerobam erected these calves by&nbsp;blocking the highways to Jerusalem to pilgrims. (Compare&nbsp;Kings I chapter 12) Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,15. תזבח ואכלת בשר</span><span class="font5">, “you will slaughter and proceed to eat meat;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments on this that the Torah does&nbsp;not speak about animals raised for </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">food</span><span class="font5">, but about animals&nbsp;raised to be offered as a sacrifice on the altar. What the&nbsp;Torah actually comes to approve here is the killing for food of&nbsp;animals raised for a holy purpose. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> based&nbsp;on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri,</span><span class="font5"> the Torah speaks here of an animal that had been&nbsp;raised by its owner to be offered as a sacrifice. Before it&nbsp;could be sacrificed however, it developed a blemish that&nbsp;disqualified it as the sacrifice it had been intended for. This&nbsp;animal may now be slaughtered and its meat be eaten,&nbsp;though its wool may not be shorn nor may it not be milked for&nbsp;its milk to be drunk. The word: רק, “only, except,” is the hint of&nbsp;what is the true meaning of the verse. An animal destined&nbsp;[too son Ed.] as a sacrifice, when disqualified through a&nbsp;permanent blemish, may be used by its </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">owner</span><span class="font5"> secularly </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">as food, but not for any other mundane purpose. However, if&nbsp;it had been shorn by someone other than the owner, the&nbsp;wool is not subject to any restrictions just because it had&nbsp;originally grown on the back of an animal that had been&nbsp;sanctified. The subject and its ramifications are discussed in&nbsp;the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Me-ilah</span><span class="font5"> folio 12. [Since, unfortunately for&nbsp;the last 2000 years this subject is not of practical&nbsp;significance, I have not given some more details mentioned&nbsp;in the Talmud there. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הטמא והטהור יחדיו </span><span class="font5">“the ritually pure and the ritually impure, may eat it simultaneously.” Prior to that animal’s&nbsp;disqualification by its blemish, the ritually impure person&nbsp;would have been forbidden to eat of its meat. The penalty for&nbsp;doing so knowingly, incidentally, is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">karet,</span><span class="font5"> posthumous&nbsp;separation from the Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;רק הדם לא תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “only the blood you must not&nbsp;eat.” Even though the Torah permits the commoner to eat the&nbsp;meat through a process of redemption, i.e. paying&nbsp;compensation to the Temple treasury for the one time&nbsp;sanctified animal, plus a small premium, its blood had been&nbsp;forbidden already prior to this animal having been sanctified,&nbsp;so how could it possibly be released through redemption?&nbsp;The same rule applies to the forbidden fat parts of any&nbsp;animal slated as a sacrifice, or not. The reason why the&nbsp;Torah singled out blood as its example, is that blood of any&nbsp;animal, whether basically fit to become a sacrifice or not, is&nbsp;forbidden, whereas the fat parts of animals not ever suitable&nbsp;as sacrifices were never forbidden. (Compare Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> folio 117)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תוכל לאכול</span><span class="font5">, “you cannot eat;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> quotes&nbsp;Rabbi Joshua son of Korchah as saying that the words לא&nbsp;תוכל, do not mean that the Levites are physically unable to&nbsp;eat the tithes in their homes or towns, but that they are&nbsp;forbidden to do so. What applies to the first tithe given to the&nbsp;Levite also applies to the “second” tithe that the Israelite&nbsp;during the respective years may consume himself but only in&nbsp;Jerusalem, or other designated town housing the Tabernacle&nbsp;at the time. If such second tithe has been redeemed by the&nbsp;farmer, then the money received must be spent in Jerusalem&nbsp;or its equivalent, for food, drink or clothing and such for the&nbsp;farmer and his family. The same applies to other gifts given&nbsp;to the priests, such as the firstlings of the harvest each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “gift” known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t’rumah,</span><span class="font5"> from the grain fields, may be eaten in the priest’s home by himself and his family and&nbsp;household.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on Joshua 15,63, the words ולא יכלו בני יהודה להורישם, “and the members of the tribe of Yehudah&nbsp;were unable to dislodge the Jebusite from their city&nbsp;(Jerusalem)” are also to be understood as a prohibition. i.e.&nbsp;the covenant made between Avraham and Avimelech for four&nbsp;generations, had not yet expired, so that G’d had not yet&nbsp;given permission for the Israelites to conquer that part of the&nbsp;land of Israel. The inhabitants of that city at that time were&nbsp;not Jebusites, i.e. Canaanites, to whom that covenant did not&nbsp;apply, but were Philistines to whom it did apply.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאכול בשעריך מעשר דגנך</span><span class="font5">, “to eat in your gates tithes of your grain harvest.” Moses here addresses the Israelites, as&nbsp;distinct from the Levites, and he speaks of the second tithe,&nbsp;that must not be eaten in their homes but in Jerusalem, or its&nbsp;equivalent after having been redeemed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובכורות בקרך וצאנך, </span><span class="font5">nor the firstlings of your cattle or flocks. Seeing that the firstlings may only be eaten by the&nbsp;priests, this verse appears to present a difficulty; why would it&nbsp;be addressed to the Israelites as a whole? It could not refer&nbsp;to firstlings that had been born blemished. Apparently, the&nbsp;farmers would set aside two “firstlings.” The first would be&nbsp;given to the priest, and the second would be treated as&nbsp;sanctified also, and therefore be consumed only in&nbsp;Jerusalem, as if it were part of a second tithe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of this phrase: the verse speaks of firstling animals that had been born as females&nbsp;and thus did not have to be given to the priests. The farmers&nbsp;would eat these female firstborns in Jerusalem, voluntarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Jerusalem Talmud there is a dispute concerning the accuracy of this version. One opinion treats the verse as&nbsp;applying to a regular male firstling animal, in which case&nbsp;Moses would have been addressing only the priests,&nbsp;whereas the second opinion claims that there is no problem&nbsp;as the priests are also Israelites and Moses did not need to&nbsp;address them separately. [Seeing that this quotation from the&nbsp;Jerusalem Talmud has not been found by Rabbi Chavell on&nbsp;whose annotations I base myself, I may be forgiven for&nbsp;feeling a little confused. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לפני ה' אלוקיך, </span><span class="font5">“in the presence of the Lord your G’d, i.e. on sacred ground in the Temple precincts,” Moses addresses&nbsp;whoever this applies to, without spelling out who they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,19. כל ימיך</span><span class="font5">, “as long as you live.” This includes even&nbsp;the years of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jubilee</span><span class="font5"> years when no crops are&nbsp;harvested. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על אדמתך</span><span class="font5">, “on your soil.” Seeing that only the ordinary Israelites possess ancestral land in Israel, as distinct from&nbsp;the Levites, the Israelites are obligated to look after the&nbsp;needs of the Levites as long as they are on their </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">own</span><span class="font5"> land,&nbsp;but not when all the Jews are in exile, and the ordinary&nbsp;Israelites do not enjoy the advantage of owning ancestral&nbsp;land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ירחיב</span><span class="font5">, “when He will expand, etc.” the content&nbsp;of this paragraph has already been written in verses 15-16 of&nbsp;our chapter. Why was it repeated? The reason is verse 27, in&nbsp;which Moses emphasises that the law to offer sacrificial&nbsp;offerings only in the Temple designated by G’d, i.e.&nbsp;Jerusalem is not affected by the size of country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: seeing that the laws Moses speaks about apply daily, he repeats them so that the people&nbsp;will be thoroughly familiar with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כאשר דבר לך</span><span class="font5">, “as He has said to you (promised);” We find this promise in Exodus 23,31, 'ושתי את גבולך וגו, “I will set your&nbsp;borders, etc.;” [an area far in excess of the Israel of King&nbsp;Solomon. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואמרת אוכלה בשר</span><span class="font5">, and you say: “I wish to eat meat” (other than sacrificial meat) from this verse we see that one should&nbsp;not eat without first having prepared it. [You do not eat meat&nbsp;as you eat an apple or a pear. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי תאוה נפשך</span><span class="font5">, “when you experience a true craving for meat.” The word כי in this verse is used as an alternative for&nbsp;the word אם, “if” or “when.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ירחק ממך המקום</span><span class="font5">, “for the place (the Temple) is&nbsp;located far distant from you.” The Torah here addresses&nbsp;Israelites who dwell beyond the borders of the Holy Land. In&nbsp;spite of this, the same law applies to them as to those who&nbsp;dwell within it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הטמא והטהור יחדו, </span><span class="font5">“the ritually impure together&nbsp;with the ritually pure.” Moses does not suggest that they both&nbsp;eat from the same bowl, as that would result in the ritually&nbsp;pure person becoming contaminated with a degree of the&nbsp;impurity of the ritually impure person. But they can both eat&nbsp;meat which was duly slaughtered etc., but not offered as a&nbsp;sacrifice, at the same table. Another example of the word&nbsp;יחדו, “together,” being used in this sense is Exodus 19,8: ויענו&nbsp;כל העם יחדו, “all the people responded together.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תשא ובאת אל המקום</span><span class="font5">, “you shall take and go to the&nbsp;place;” when we pray on the festivals we say in our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">prayer: והשיאנו ה' אלוקינו את ברכת מועדיך, “cause us O Lord our&nbsp;G’d </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to take with us </span><span class="font5">the blessing of Your festivals, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ודם זבחיך</span><span class="font5">, “and the blood of your meat offerings,”&nbsp;this is a reference to the so-called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’lamim,</span><span class="font5"> “peace-offerings,” (consumed in the main by the donors)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנשר תאכל</span><span class="font5">, “and the meat you may eat;” [as opposed to the blood and the fat parts. Ed.] the meat will be consumed&nbsp;by the priest on duty at that time according to the priestly&nbsp;roster, or the common Israelite, depending on the type of&nbsp;offering and the parts of the animal designated for either&nbsp;priest or laymen. (Ibn Ezra).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,29. כי יכרית ה' אלוקיך</span><span class="font5">, “when the Lord your G’d will cut off, etc.” this paragraph has been inserted here, as unless&nbsp;G’d cuts off the gentile nations, how is He going to widen the&nbsp;boundaries of your Land?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לרשת אותם מפניך</span><span class="font5">, “and to dispossess them on your account;” the word מפניך actually is the continuation of the&nbsp;beginning of the verse, i.e. כי יכרית.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12,31. אשר שנא, </span><span class="font5">“which He hates;” He hates these rituals&nbsp;even if you employ them in order to serve </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font5">;” it would&nbsp;enrage him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.1. לא תוסף עליו</span><span class="font5">, “do not add thereto;” the letter ס here&nbsp;has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzeyre</span><span class="font5"> under it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">עליו</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">additional</span><span class="font5"> numbers of sheep, goats of bulls to the offerings. Neither must you add other categories of offerings,&nbsp;such as your sons or daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא תגרע ממנו</span><span class="font5">, “neither are you to detract from the categories of offerings” designated by the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי יקום בקרבך נביא</span><span class="font5">, “if a prophet arises in your&nbsp;midst;” this subject is introduced here as the subject of&nbsp;idolatry will follow thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובא האות והמופת</span><span class="font5">, “and the sign or wonder predicted&nbsp;will come to pass;” the letter ו in the word והמופת means: “or.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have a similar construction in Exodus 21,15, where the line: ומכה אביו ואמו, means: “anyone who strikes his father or&nbsp;his mother.” Similar constructions occur in Exodus 21,17,&nbsp;and in numerous other places in the Torah. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> quotes&nbsp;a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baraitha</span><span class="font5"> in which Rabbi Akiva is cited as saying that we&nbsp;must not be misled into believing that G’d would interfere&nbsp;with the position of sun or moon in order to comply with the&nbsp;wishes of a false prophet. What is meant in our verse is that&nbsp;a true prophet, who has in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">past</span><span class="font5"> performed miracles, and&nbsp;had thus legitimised himself by having performed such&nbsp;miracles, has become a heretic and the people now believe&nbsp;him, not knowing that he has become a heretic. If such a&nbsp;prophet would call on the people to perform acts of idolatry,&nbsp;he must not be believed, regardless of the fact that at one&nbsp;time he was a legitimate prophet. No true prophet is to be&nbsp;believed if his message entails violating laws of the Torah,&nbsp;regardless of how many times he had in the past&nbsp;demonstrated that he was a true prophet, unless when he did&nbsp;so he said that he suggested such a violation </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> as a one&nbsp;time emergency measure due to exceptional circumstances.&nbsp;If you were to ask, that seeing that G’d knew in advance that&nbsp;such a prophet would turn into a heretic, so why did He equip&nbsp;him with prophetic powers in the first place?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah answers this question by telling us that it is G’d’s way of testing our faith in Moses’ Torah being the one&nbsp;and only Torah He has given us, and that it will not undergo&nbsp;changes in the course of history. (verse 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is even more true, when the so-called prophet performs acts by a slight of hand which deceive the&nbsp;onlookers into believing that he had performed miracle. The&nbsp;same is true if such a charlatan knows how to trick you into&nbsp;believing that you had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">heard</span><span class="font5"> things in the name of the Lord,&nbsp;things which he had never heard from G’d. Do not let either&nbsp;your eyes or your ears deceive you when the subject is the&nbsp;inviolability of the laws of the Torah. You must follow only the&nbsp;revealed word of G’d as handed down by Moses in the&nbsp;Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,4. לא תשמע אל דברי הניא ההוא</span><span class="font5">, “do not listen to the words of that “prophet;” it is illogical to believe that such a&nbsp;prophet’s miracle could override My commandments to you,&nbsp;seeing that I have warned you of the possibility of such false&nbsp;prophets arising already </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> any such person did in fact&nbsp;claim to be My prophet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי מנסה </span><span class="font5">“for He is testing;” I already explained the meaning of this “test.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הישכם</span><span class="font5">, the letter י in this word has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי דבר סרה</span><span class="font5">, “for something perverse;” he falsified&nbsp;the message he claimed to have received from Me,” What he&nbsp;did was to lead you astray from revering Me. Where is the&nbsp;warning to such a false prophet not to practice his perversion&nbsp;given? It has been spelled out in the words of the Torah, with&nbsp;which he his familiar, “do not listen to him!” (Exodus 23,13)&nbsp;(Compare Torah </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’leymah</span><span class="font5"> by Rabbi Menachem Kasher&nbsp;item 182 on that verse.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אחיך בן אמך</span><span class="font5">, “your brother, the son of your mother.”&nbsp;The same applies to “your brother, the son of your father;”&nbsp;the reason why the Torah chose as its example the brother,&nbsp;son of your mother,” is that normally the bonds to one’s&nbsp;mother are closer, and one is in the same house with one’s&nbsp;mother all the time, while the father is in the field or&nbsp;elsewhere outside the house, earning his livelihood.&nbsp;Moreover, brotherly love to one another is often tainted by&nbsp;the fact that one has to share the father’s inheritance with&nbsp;one’s brother of the father, but not with a brother of the same&nbsp;mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,9. לא תאבה לו</span><span class="font5">, “you shall not consent to him (his&nbsp;suggestion) according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> the root of the word is אהב,&nbsp;Hence the meaning of the line is: “do not profess to love&nbsp;him;” we have a similar construction when the Torah asks us&nbsp;to love our fellow human beings as thyself in Leviticus 19,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא תשמע אליו</span><span class="font5">, “and to not even listen to him.” If he pleads with you to forgive him, in order not to report his&nbsp;criminal suggestions to the authorities, although as a rule the&nbsp;Torah teaches us not to abandon a person in need, (Exodus&nbsp;23,5), in this instance this rule is to be ignored. Even though&nbsp;we are not to indulge in reciprocal hatred when the hatred&nbsp;has been initiated by the other person, in this instance we&nbsp;must react differently and prevent the spread of idolatry by&nbsp;enabling such a person to convert naive people to his&nbsp;seduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,11. באבנים ומת</span><span class="font5">, “with stones so that he will die.” The stoning is to continue until the false prophet or seducer will&nbsp;die. If the first rock did not kill him then more rocks will be&nbsp;hurled at him. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span><span class="font5"> Where did the Torah issue its warning&nbsp;against such seducers who had not claimed to be prophets&nbsp;able to perform miracles? Compare verse 12 and how it is&nbsp;explained in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> folio 63.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">13,18. ולא ידבק בידך מאומה מן החרם</span><span class="font5">, “none of the loot shall cleave to your hand from this “cursed” material. If you had&nbsp;imagined that you would benefit from this kind of loot, the&nbsp;opposite is the case, it will only bring disaster upon you.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ורחמך</span><span class="font5">, “and He will have compassion on you.” The letter ר in the word ורחמך has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik,</span><span class="font5"> followed by the&nbsp;vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach</span><span class="font5"> under the letter ח, and the semi vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">under the letter .מ</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והרבך</span><span class="font5">, “and He will cause you to multiply.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,1. בנים אתם</span><span class="font5">, “you are the children, etc.;” this paragraph has been inserted </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">here</span><span class="font5"> in order to warn you not to&nbsp;observe pagan methods of expressing mourning after the&nbsp;death of close relatives. Possibly, one of the inhabitants of&nbsp;the idolatrous city discussed in the previous paragraph was a&nbsp;close relative, and you might have had to observe mourning&nbsp;rites as he or she had been put to death as a result of that&nbsp;city’s destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בנים אתם לה' אלוקיכם</span><span class="font5">, “you are children of the Lord your G’d;” it is just because you are children of Mine that you must&nbsp;understand that the death of a family member whenever and&nbsp;wherever, is not an unmitigated disaster, though it appears to&nbsp;affect you as such, but that I, in My greater wisdom, have&nbsp;decided that the deceased’s place in the universe was no&nbsp;longer on earth, for his own greater </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">benefit</span><span class="font5">. Just as small&nbsp;children sometimes, or even often, do not appreciate that&nbsp;what their father does, even if it hurts them, is for their&nbsp;benefit, the same is true in your relationship to Me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא תשימו קרחה בין עיניכם למת</span><span class="font5">, “neither are you to make bald spots between your eyes for the dead.” Even if your&nbsp;father died, you are not as bereaved as would be one of the&nbsp;gentiles who lost his father, as you have a Father in heaven&nbsp;who will never die. The pagan who looks upon his idol as his&nbsp;father image, what does he have, a piece of wood or metal?&nbsp;When he loses his biological father, he suffers a great loss&nbsp;compared to you whose father in Heaven will continue to&nbsp;provide for him. Compare Jeremiah 2,27, who describes how&nbsp;ludicrous it is for the pagans to address their man-made idols&nbsp;as “my father!” Furthermore, you are a holy nation, and as&nbsp;such are not at liberty to desecrate your bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,3. לא תאכל כל תועבה</span><span class="font5">, “you must not eat anything that is abominable.” This subject is linked here to that of&nbsp;forbidden rites of mourning, as it too is part of your being a&nbsp;holy nation, as repeated in the last verse. Holiness, i.e.&nbsp;apartness, means, among other things, that your food is&nbsp;different from that of the pagans, who are not too&nbsp;distinguishable from the creatures which they choose to&nbsp;worship. You are to eat only what is ritually pure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.5. איל</span><span class="font5">, “the hart, etc;” [our author proceeds to translate the names of these seven species into medieval&nbsp;French, something of little use my readers. Ed.] In plain&nbsp;English, permitted species of mammals are: ox, sheep, goat;&nbsp;deer, gazelle, roebuck, wild goat, ibex, antelope and&nbsp;mountain sheep plus unnamed species (if there are such)&nbsp;displaying the identification marks listed by the Torah. They&nbsp;are: bringing up the cud, true hooves cleft in two;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.6.</span><span class="font5"> Any mammal that displays some of these identifying marks but not others are forbidden. [The Torah&nbsp;proceeds to name the most popular mammals kept as&nbsp;domestic beats, such as pigs, dogs, camels, hares and&nbsp;rabbits must not be eaten. The latter, including cats, must not&nbsp;be eaten because they have no hooves at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,8. </span><span class="font5">you are not to touch their carcasses with a view to&nbsp;preparing them as food, just as the Torah forbade touching&nbsp;holy things in Leviticus 12,4 for people in a state of bodily&nbsp;ritual impurity. Touching such carcasses and eating them is&nbsp;considered pas part of the same prohibition. If touching these&nbsp;carcasses by itself were the prohibition, why would the Torah&nbsp;have to bother forbidding eating them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;טמא הוא לכם</span><span class="font5">, “it is ritually impure for you.” The&nbsp;word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">טמא </span><span class="font5">here is not to be understood in the ritual sense of&nbsp;impurity, the person having contacted such animals requiring&nbsp;to perform purification rites before handling matters that are&nbsp;holy, but is an expression for something detestable. The&nbsp;concept of ritual impurity does not exist concerning fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression טמא as clearly meaning something detestable is found in Ezekiel 4,13: “shall the Israelites eat&nbsp;their bread unclean in a disgusting unappetizing manner&nbsp;(among the nations that banish them?)”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.11</span><span class="font5">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">צפור טהורה</span><span class="font5">, “any ritually pure bird;” whenever&nbsp;the Torah uses the term צפור instead of עוף for “bird,” it is&nbsp;automatically referring to a ritually pure species of birds. The&nbsp;latter term, however, is used on different occasions for either&nbsp;category of birds. Ritually impure birds are always described&nbsp;as עוף. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזה אשר לא תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “and these are the ones of&nbsp;which you may not eat;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that the word זה is&nbsp;meant to include that the prohibition includes if these birds&nbsp;had been of the permitted kind, but were used in a procedure&nbsp;prescribed as a sin offering. They must not be eaten even&nbsp;though slaughtered in the appropriate manner. (Compare&nbsp;Leviticus 14,4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.ראה,איה דיה, דאה </span><span class="font5">“glede, falcon, buzzard and kite;”&nbsp;[none of these species can be indentified with certainty. This&nbsp;is why different translations use some of the names&nbsp;interchangeably. Ed.] According to our author, the four&nbsp;names mentioned here are really one. How is this to be&nbsp;understood? Seeing that we find the expression למינה,&nbsp;“according to its kind (species)”in the singular mode instead&nbsp;of in the plural mode at the end of this verse, they must have&nbsp;something important in common with each other. We find a&nbsp;similar verse in Leviticus 11,14, in connection with the bird&nbsp;called איה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">this proves that איה and דיה are two names for the&nbsp;same species. Similarly, ראה and דיה are also the same&nbsp;species. [I have omitted the author’s somewhat convoluted&nbsp;method of proving this point. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,16 ואת בת היענה</span><span class="font5">, “and the little owl;” the same is true of the יענה, the great owl. The Torah mentions the little owl as&nbsp;it is not fit to be eaten except as long as it is very young. Its&nbsp;flesh is hard as wood when it matures. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל עוף טהור תאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “you may eat every ritually pure&nbsp;bird.” According to the plain meaning of the text this includes&nbsp;certain species of locusts and grasshoppers not listed here&nbsp;by name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תאכלו כל נבלה</span><span class="font5">, “you must not eat the carcass of&nbsp;any animal that died of natural causes.” This includes&nbsp;carcasses of normally ritually pure mammals, free roaming&nbsp;beasts birds and ritually not pure fish. Ritually pure fish are&nbsp;permitted to be eaten </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">even</span><span class="font5"> if they died from natural causes.&nbsp;The reason why this appears to have been repeated is so&nbsp;that no one would have an excuse to say that only the&nbsp;carcasses of mammals, free roaming beasts and pure birds&nbsp;are forbidden if they died from natural causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל נבלה</span><span class="font5">, “any type of carcass that died of natural causes.” The use of the word כל to mean “any,” and not “all,”&nbsp;we have seen already in verse 3 in our chapter “כל תועבה,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">anything</span><span class="font5"> abominable, as well as in Exodus 20,10: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תעשה כל&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">מלאכה,”you must not perform </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">any</span><span class="font5"> work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">או מכור לנכרי, </span><span class="font5">or to be sold to a gentile.” The letter ל in the word לנכרי has the semi vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תבשל גדי</span><span class="font5">, “do not boil a kid;” This was repeated here to teach that (its youth notwithstanding?) it is considered as&nbsp;meat. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עשר תעשר</span><span class="font5">, “you must surely tithe, etc.;” the&nbsp;reason why this paragraph was added at this point is that&nbsp;earlier we had read about not eating anything that is ritually&nbsp;impure, followed by meat that is forbidden to eat, followed&nbsp;now by agricultural products the eating of which is restricted&nbsp;to certain holy locations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עשר תעשר</span><span class="font5">, “the command is repeated in order to also forbid trading in tithes, not only eating in the wrong location.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Tanchuma, Re-ay</span><span class="font5"> section 18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: The words </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עשר תעשר, </span><span class="font5">by themselves, could be understood as applying to anything that&nbsp;grows being subject to tithing. The fact that the Torah added&nbsp;the word: ואכלת, “and that you eat,” restricts the need to tithe&nbsp;to crops grown with the intent to serve as food. I might now&nbsp;have thought that such foods as honey and milk could be&nbsp;included also in the legislation to tithe; in order to tell us that&nbsp;this is not so, the Torah added the words: היוצא השדה, “which&nbsp;is the product of the field.” This excludes among other items&nbsp;plants that do not derive their nutrients from the moisture in&nbsp;the soil. Actually, the verse about not boiling a kid in the milk&nbsp;of its mother has been written in three separate parts of the&nbsp;Torah, and each time it has been repeated a new element&nbsp;has been added to this commandment as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> has&nbsp;explained. At this stage the new element is that of not&nbsp;desecrating the second tithe, as indicated by the need to&nbsp;convert (redeem) it if it is not capable of being transported to&nbsp;Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,23. למען תלמד ליראה, </span><span class="font5">“in order that you may learn to revere, etc.” This expression is meant to refer to reverence&nbsp;for the Lord becoming something natural, a daily occurrence,&nbsp;part of your everyday life, not something restricted to when&nbsp;one visits the synagogue and prays intently. When people&nbsp;observe the laws of the second tithe that apply to the&nbsp;average farmer being observed by huge crowds coming to&nbsp;Jerusalem and being exposed to priests in great numbers,&nbsp;this will make a deep impression upon them and be an&nbsp;unforgettable experience. Seeing the Supreme Court in&nbsp;session in Jerusalem will also be an experience that will&nbsp;increase the degree of reverence for the Lord your G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14,25. וצרת הכסף בידך</span><span class="font5">, ”and bind up the money (silver coins);” the letter ד in the word of בידך, has the semi vowel&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והלוי אשר בשעריך</span><span class="font5">, “and the Levite who is within&nbsp;your gates;” you are not to seek out Levites that do not live&nbsp;within your cities to give these tithes to. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תעזבנו</span><span class="font5">, “do not abandon him.” The Torah had already stated the same instruction in a positive formulation, i.e. to&nbsp;look after the Levites. (Deut. 12,12) Now it adds the negative&nbsp;aspect, forbidding us to abandon the Levite. The new angle&nbsp;here is that in the event that the tithes that the Levite in your&nbsp;town receives are not adequate, you must dig into your&nbsp;pocket to offer him additional support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תוציא את כל מעשר</span><span class="font5">, “you shall bring forth all the&nbsp;tithes;” there are three years in the seven year </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">cycle that the tithe instead of being deposited in your towns&nbsp;(your homes) awaiting Levites to ask for it must be brought&nbsp;out and not kept anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How does all this work? In the first and second year of the cycle the first tithe goes to a Levite, whereas the second&nbsp;tithe is taken to Jerusalem by the owner to be eaten there&nbsp;with his family. The same is true of the second year of the&nbsp;cycle. In the third year of the cycle the first tithe goes to the&nbsp;Levite, whereas the second “tithe” is to be distributed locally&nbsp;or as near as possible to the poor. The verse that is relevant&nbsp;to this is chapter Deut. 26,12. The Torah calls that year: “the&nbsp;year of the tithe,” as only the first tithe is given to the Levite in&nbsp;that year. The gifts given to the poor amounting to the same&nbsp;amount as the second tithe, is not called tithe, as it is&nbsp;designated for the poor at the full discretion of the grower of&nbsp;that produce. The second three years of the cycle are a&nbsp;repeat of the first three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנחת בשערך</span><span class="font5">, “and deposit it in your gates.” Whereas the second tithe is to be taken to Jerusalem, the tithe for the poor&nbsp;is to he kept locally, so as to be available conveniently for the&nbsp;local poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,1. מקץ שבע שנים</span><span class="font5">, “at the conclusion of seven years;” the rules governing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> year do not commence until&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">end</span><span class="font5"> of the seventh year. The reason why this paragraph&nbsp;is appended here is that in 14,29, we have read that we have&nbsp;to care for the poor, the orphans, the widows, and the&nbsp;stranger, and this is what basically the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> legislation is&nbsp;also about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזה דבר השמיטה</span><span class="font5">, “and this is the manner of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah,</span><span class="font5"> release;” this year even releases a person from&nbsp;fulfilling an undertaking confirmed by an oath. If a person had&nbsp;undertaken to do something for his fellow and confirmed it by&nbsp;an oath, the advent of the end of the last day of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">year releases him from it if he had not made good on his&nbsp;promise until then. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שמוט כל בעל משה ידו</span><span class="font5">, “every creditor shall release that which he has lent;” only loans are released, not proceeds&nbsp;from a robbery or something given to keep in trust. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא יגוש</span><span class="font5">, “he (the creditor) shall not exact it.” Why does this have to be added? The Torah has already asked the&nbsp;creditor to release the debtor from his indebtedness, if he&nbsp;had been unable to repay him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Imagine the following scenario: a debtor, who owns a field, has dutifully released the seventh year’s crop to fulfill&nbsp;G’d’s commandment, as a result of which has no crop of his&nbsp;own to sell and to use the proceeds to repay his loan to his&nbsp;creditor. During normal years he would not have had a&nbsp;problem to repay his loan. If the creditor now presses the&nbsp;debtor to repay him what he owes him, but adds that he will&nbsp;gladly wait until after next year’s crop has ripened for the&nbsp;debtor to repay him, this is forbidden. The Torah forbids the&nbsp;creditor to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">extend</span><span class="font5"> the terms of the loan. This would not be&nbsp;fulfilling the Torah’s law of: “release it!” This is the meaning of&nbsp;the term: מקרא קודש in Leviticus 23,7 and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי קרא </span><span class="font5">שמטה, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Time</span><span class="font5"> is of the essence in this legislation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את הנכרי</span><span class="font5">, “the gentile debtor, who is allowed to&nbsp;grow crops during that year and sell them, and is therefore&nbsp;able to repay his debts, him you may exact repayment from&nbsp;during that year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את אחיך תשמוט ידך, </span><span class="font5">“what is your brother’s you must not exact from him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is an exception to this rule when the creditor in question has deposited the loan agreement with a Jewish&nbsp;court, and he charges the court with collecting the debt from&nbsp;the debtor, as if the debt were owed to the court. In this way&nbsp;a debtor who is able to repay but hides behind this legislation&nbsp;to procrastinate repayment until the end of this year will not&nbsp;benefit by his insincerity. He will prefer to repay the creditor&nbsp;and not ruin his reputation as a potential borrower. This&nbsp;system known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prusbol,</span><span class="font5"> was introduced by Hillel, as&nbsp;otherwise lenders would simply not extend loans to indigent&nbsp;borrowers who did not either put up a security or pay interest,&nbsp;which it is forbidden for a Jew to charge a fellow Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,4. אפס כי לא יהיה בך אביון</span><span class="font5">, “there will be no destitute among you;” this is the Torah’s promise if the people of Israel&nbsp;will meticulously observe the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel</span><span class="font5"> year&nbsp;legislation. [The latter occurs only once in 50 years. Ed.] The&nbsp;reason that is so is that the poor who had felt forced to sell&nbsp;themselves or their daughters, will automatically regain their&nbsp;status as free men in the next </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> year, and if they still&nbsp;owe money, that debt will have been scrapped at the end of&nbsp;the most recent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> cycle. With the advent of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">year, they or their heirs will automatically regain their title to&nbsp;the ancestral heritage they might have had to sell earlier. No&nbsp;one will therefore be permanently destitute. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי ברך יברכך</span><span class="font5">, G’d will bless both the lender and the borrower (hence the repeat of the verb ברך in this verse). We&nbsp;have already explained how the borrower will become&nbsp;blessed. As a result of the lender having foregone a claim he&nbsp;had on the borrower, G’d promises him that he will not&nbsp;become poorer as a result of having done so. In practice, G’d&nbsp;will see to it that he has the opportunity to extend loans to&nbsp;gentiles who will pay him generous interest for having&nbsp;received such loans. (Verse 6) If you were to argue that you&nbsp;do not even have contact with such gentiles, the Torah&nbsp;promises that they, of themselves, will make contact with you&nbsp;for such purpose, as you will dominate their countries&nbsp;politically, i.e. ומשלת בגויים רבים, “you will rule over many&nbsp;nations,” (end of verse 6).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.6. ברכך כאשר דבר לך</span><span class="font5">, “He will bless you as He has promised you.” Where has this blessing been spelled out?&nbsp;Look at Deuteronomy 7,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא תקפץ</span><span class="font5">, “and do not shut (your hand).” This&nbsp;expression occurs in the same meaning in Psalms 107,42 as&nbsp;well as in Job 5,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;העבט תעביטנו</span><span class="font5">, “take his security pawn as a&nbsp;guarantee that he will repay you the loan.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;קרבה שנת השבע</span><span class="font5">, “the seventh year of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">is approaching; “I might not get paid back because of the law&nbsp;to remit outstanding debts.” Moreover, in the coming year&nbsp;this lender will not even be allowed to seed his field and&nbsp;harvest a crop from which to sustain </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">himself</span><span class="font5">. As a result of&nbsp;such considerations he does not wish to extend a loan to the&nbsp;needy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא ירע לבבך בתתך לו</span><span class="font5">, “not only are you not to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">refuse a loan but you must not extend a loan reluctantly;” the Torah warns you not to think that you will suffer economic&nbsp;hardship for having been good-hearted. G’d promises that&nbsp;He will bless your for your good heartedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי לא יחדל אביון</span><span class="font5">, “for there will not cease to be&nbsp;destitute people.” This sounds like a contradiction to what the&nbsp;Torah had promised in verse 4, where it stated that there&nbsp;would not be destitute people in our land. The promise in&nbsp;verse 4 had been linked to a condition. i.e. that the entire&nbsp;population observes the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">yovel</span><span class="font5"> legislation. The&nbsp;critical word there had been the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי</span><span class="font5">. In our verse here&nbsp;this word occurs again but here it means: “maybe, possibly.”&nbsp;In our paragraph the word כי occurs no fewer than four times.&nbsp;It has a different meaning each time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have a conditional word כי in כי יהיה בך אביון, “if there should be among you a destitute person;” we have a word כי&nbsp;meaning “but,” in כי פתוח תפתח, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">but</span><span class="font5"> you shall definitively open&nbsp;your hand;” we have the word כי meaning “because of” in בגלל&nbsp;הדבר הזה, “for the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">sake</span><span class="font5"> of this matter G’d will bless you;” and&nbsp;we have the word כי meaning “so that not,” in כי לא יחדל אביון&nbsp;“if perchance your actions </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were not charitable enough </span><span class="font5">to&nbsp;prevent the existence of destitute people among you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאחיך, </span><span class="font5">“to your brother, who takes precedence over your unrelated neighbour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לענייך, </span><span class="font5">“to the poor in your town,” who take precedence over the poor in neighbouring towns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאביוניך בארצך</span><span class="font5">, “to the destitute in your country,” who take precedence over the destitute people in another&nbsp;country. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,12. כי ימכר לך</span><span class="font5">, “if your brother (fellow Jew) will be sold&nbsp;to you;” the reason why this paragraph has been written here&nbsp;is because the paragraphs written immediately preceding this&nbsp;one dealt with situations in which Jews have become poor,&nbsp;and how to forestall wholesale poverty amongst Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועבדך</span><span class="font5">, “and he will serve you;” the emphasis is on the pronoun ending “you,” which precludes this Jewish servant&nbsp;from being passed on to the heir of his master, even if the&nbsp;period for which he had been indentured had not come to an&nbsp;end. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תשלחנו חפשי מעמך </span><span class="font5">“you have to release him unconditionally.” If he was released due to having fallen sick,&nbsp;and he recovered, and you felt that he should recompense&nbsp;you for the period that he was not working for you, the Torah&nbsp;writes: “in the seventh year he will go free, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">period</span><span class="font5">,”&nbsp;regardless of whether he has rendered the required number&nbsp;of years of service. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri</span><span class="font5"> on Exodus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">21,2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,14. מצאנך, מגרנך, ומיקבך</span><span class="font5">, “from your flocks, your threshing-floor or your winepress.” These terms are short for&nbsp;“bread, wine, and meat.” The verse discusses a thief who&nbsp;has been sold by the court as he did not have the means to&nbsp;repay his victim for what he had stolen from him. Seeing that&nbsp;he is penniless, how could he establish an economic footing&nbsp;and not begin to steal again unless you provided him with&nbsp;these essentials? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתת באזנו ובדלת</span><span class="font5">, “and you will thrust it (the awl)&nbsp;through his ear into the door;” the door frame is presumed to&nbsp;be made of wood and therefore can be pierced easily, as&nbsp;opposed to a door frame made of stone. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.18. לא יקשה בעיניך</span><span class="font5">, “it shall not appear an unreasonably hard rule to you;” (that you have to give him so&nbsp;much for “free”) The Torah reminds the owner that he had&nbsp;obtained far more value in labour from this “slave” than he&nbsp;would have had from an ordinary hired labourer working for&nbsp;him as he had been at his disposal not only during the&nbsp;daylight hours, etc. [Our author suggests a different&nbsp;comparison, one found in Isaiah 16,14, according to which&nbsp;fixed labour is hired only for three years and this man has&nbsp;served six years. Ed.] Different calculations are made by&nbsp;different commentators; the basic common denominator&nbsp;agreed is that the Torah reminds the employer/owner, that&nbsp;this servant/slave has done more for him than a hired hand&nbsp;would have done. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יברכך ה' אלוקיך</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord your G’d will bless you.” Whenever the Torah asks members of the Jewish people to&nbsp;give up something they considered as belonging to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">them,</span><span class="font5"> we&nbsp;find a verse where G’d promises them that they will enjoy His&nbsp;blessing, i.e. that in the end instead of becoming poorer&nbsp;through sharing material blessings with the less fortunate&nbsp;members of society, they will become wealthier. They will&nbsp;experience beyond question that G’d will make all their&nbsp;undertakings successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15,19. כל הבכור</span><span class="font5">, “all the firstling males, etc.;” this&nbsp;paragraph has been written here seeing that previously the&nbsp;Torah dealt with the rules governing the treatment of a&nbsp;Jewish “slave,” i.e. someone employed by a fellow Jew not of&nbsp;his free choice, and not free to leave such employment at&nbsp;will. Here, in verse 19, the Torah imposes restrictions on how&nbsp;the owner of an </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">animal</span><span class="font5"> is not free to treat such an animal as&nbsp;if it did not possess any rights, i.e. לא תעבוד בבכור שורך, “you&nbsp;shall not make the firstborn of your ox perform menial&nbsp;labour.” Not only that, but the Torah has repeated this&nbsp;legislation in order to teach us that a blemished firstling&nbsp;animal must not even be offered as a sacrifice to G’d. (unless&nbsp;it was not born through entering the world through its&nbsp;mother’s womb, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר יולד</span><span class="font5">) (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הזכר תקדיש, </span><span class="font5">if such a firstling animal is male, you must treat it as holy for the Lord your Gd. You must offer such an&nbsp;animal to the Lord your G’d as His, and consume the parts&nbsp;that are permitted in a location that is sacred, after having&nbsp;performed the rites pertaining to sacrificial animals. The&nbsp;rituals are fewer than normal sacrificial offerings, as there is&nbsp;no need to perform </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s’michah,</span><span class="font5"> etc. i.e. the symbolic acts&nbsp;raising this animal to the status of being holy as such, as it&nbsp;has been born holy. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menachot,</span><span class="font5"> folio 90)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כל מום רע</span><span class="font5">, “any serious blemish;” for instance the&nbsp;offering to G’d as a sacrifice of an animal born with a serious&nbsp;blemish. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תזבחנה</span><span class="font5">, “you must not sacrifice it;” the reason is clear, seeing that G’d had already declared this animal as being&nbsp;“Mine,” so how could the owner of its mother bring it as “his&nbsp;offering” (compare Exodus 12,9) From that verse I would&nbsp;have inferred that both perfect and blemished firstborn&nbsp;animals could not be offered as a sacrifice. This is why the&nbsp;Torah repeats here that we speak about a blemished&nbsp;firstborn male animal only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">15.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בשעריך תאכלנו, </span><span class="font5">”you shall eat it within your gates&nbsp;(not on sacred grounds);” the Torah here addresses the&nbsp;priest, as a commoner is not allowed to eat it anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הטמא והטהור</span><span class="font5">, “the ritually impure as well as the ritually pure.” The author already explained this term in his&nbsp;commentary on Exodus 12,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שמור</span><span class="font5">, “wait until the month of spring.” The month&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nissan</span><span class="font5"> is called the month of spring, as the spring equinox&nbsp;occurs always during that month. Crops known as אביב, ripen&nbsp;during that month in the land of Israel. They are primarily the&nbsp;barley crops. We have been told this already in connection&nbsp;with the plague of hail in Exodus 9,31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועשית פסח</span><span class="font5">, “and you must observe the Passover;”&nbsp;the Torah was forced to repeat this law as in verse 5 of this&nbsp;chapter it stipulated that once the people were in their own&nbsp;land they were forbidden to offer this offering and consume it&nbsp;in their own dwellings, outside of Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the expression: ממצרים לילה, “from Egypt, at night,” the word לילה here refers only to the eating of the Passover,&nbsp;as the Exodus did not commence until the morning of the&nbsp;fifteenth of Nissan, and they had been absolutely forbidden&nbsp;on pain of death to leave their homes already during that&nbsp;night. (Exodus 12,22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,3. לא תאכל עליו חמץ</span><span class="font5">, “you must not eat any leavened products with it.” The word עליו here means the same as the&nbsp;word: עמו, “with it,” elsewhere. Other examples where the&nbsp;word עליו is used in the same sense as here are: Exodus&nbsp;12,9: ראשו על כרעיו ועל קרבו, “its head </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> its legs, and </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">the inwards thereof.” Compare also Exodus 34,25: לא תשחוט&nbsp;על חמץ דם זבחי, “do not offer the blood of My sacrifice </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">leavened bread. “</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעת ימים תאכל עליו מצות</span><span class="font5">, “for seven consecutive days shall you eat unleavened bread with it.” In this verse we best&nbsp;translate the word: עליו as “on account of it.” Compare also&nbsp;Psalms 44,23: כי עליך הורגנו כל היום, “for on Your account we&nbsp;are being killed every day;” compare also Psalms 69,8: כי עליב&nbsp;נשאני חרפה, “for on Your account have I been reviled.” In other&nbsp;words: you are to eat unleavened bread on account of the&nbsp;Passover sacrifice which you offer as a memorial of the&nbsp;Exodus from Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לחם עוני</span><span class="font5">, “bread of affliction.” Poor people when given a small amount of flour, do not have a vessel at hand in order&nbsp;to make a proper dough. They also do not have enough time&nbsp;to spare to wait for the dough to rise before baking it.&nbsp;Therefore they throw the mixture of flour and water into the&nbsp;heated stove at once and retrieve is as soon as it is baked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי בחפזון יצאת, </span><span class="font5">“for when you departed from Egypt you were in a great hurry;” G’d could have waited until the&nbsp;Israelites had baked their dough by taking their time.&nbsp;However, He wanted them to have an eternal reminder of the&nbsp;haste in which their departure had taken place, and therefore&nbsp;He urged them to act with haste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למען תזכור את יום צאתך ממצרים, </span><span class="font5">“all this in order that you will have a visible reminder of the day that you came out of&nbsp;Egypt.” Rabbi Eleazar ben Azaryah is quoted in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Haggadah shel Pessach</span><span class="font5"> as saying that although he feels as&nbsp;if seventy years old, he had not properly understood the&nbsp;meaning of the words: “in order that you may remember the&nbsp;day you came out of Egypt aj] the days of your lives,” until&nbsp;the sage ben Zoma had explained the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל </span><span class="font5">in this verse to&nbsp;mean: “the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">whole</span><span class="font5"> days of your lives,” i.e. not only the daylight&nbsp;hours but also during the nighttime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא ילין מן הבשר</span><span class="font5">, “and no part of the meat of the&nbsp;Passover lamb is to remain uneaten until the morning of the&nbsp;15<sup>th</sup> of the month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If it were allowed to remain uneaten all night long, it would follow that this sacrifice is the only one for which no&nbsp;time-limit for eating it had been fixed by the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that this limitation actually had been decreed only for the original Passover which had been&nbsp;consumed in Egypt. This seems difficult, as we have a verse&nbsp;in Exodus 34,24 as well as in Numbers 9,12 where this&nbsp;prohibition to leave part of the Passover until the following&nbsp;morning is spelled out clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תוכל לזבוח את הפסח באחד שעריך</span><span class="font5">, “you must not&nbsp;slaughter the Passover in one of your gates;” this applies not&nbsp;only to the Passover but to all other sacrifices. The reason it&nbsp;has been repeated here is that seeing that the Torah had&nbsp;decreed that during the days of the Passover festival&nbsp;unleavened bread only must be eaten “in all your dwellings,”&nbsp;I might have concluded that seeing that at least on the first&nbsp;night when the Passover lamb is to be eaten at the same&nbsp;time as unleavened bread, someone might have erred&nbsp;believing that what applied to the eating of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Matza</span><span class="font5"> would&nbsp;apply also to the Passover lamb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: even though the Torah had already warned concerning this, it saw fit to repeat the&nbsp;warning because seeing that this was a sacrifice permitted&nbsp;(commanded) to be eaten by all the commoners, it could also&nbsp;be slaughtered everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שם תזבח את הפסח</span><span class="font5">, “there </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5">, (in the place&nbsp;decreed by the Lord) you will slaughter the Passover.”&nbsp;Seeing that the Torah, in connection with the offerings of the&nbsp;firstling male animals which could be consumed only on the&nbsp;hallowed grounds of the Temple, and seeing that the rules of&nbsp;the second Passover (for people who through no fault of their&nbsp;own had been unable to slaughter it on the fourteenth day of&nbsp;Nissan, were also written in Numbers chapter 9, and there no&nbsp;mention was made of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">where</span><span class="font5"> such a substitute Passover was&nbsp;to be slaughtered, the Torah here makes sure that we cannot&nbsp;remain in any doubt about this. Not only the date, but also&nbsp;the location are of the essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah here did not bother to mention New Year’s or the Day of Atonement, as neither of these Holy Days&nbsp;involves assemblies in Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בערב, </span><span class="font5">“in the evening;” this may be understood literally, i.e. after noon, until nightfall. In the Jewish calendar, the&nbsp;evening commences “a half hour after noon.” Since the&nbsp;Israelites did not leave until the morning of the following day,&nbsp;our verse must speak about the afternoon and evening of the&nbsp;day before. The author admits that there is nowhere a&nbsp;definite proof that the evening starts that early, he cites&nbsp;support from verses in Jeremiah 6,4,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.7.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובשלת</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">the true meaning of the word בשל is: “to&nbsp;make something ready and fit to eat.” The author cites&nbsp;Genesis 40,10, הבשילו אשכלותיה ענבים, “its grape clusters had&nbsp;become ripe,” or Exodus 23,19: גם,לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו &quot;do&nbsp;not boil the kid in the milk of its mother,” as support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ששת ימים תאכל מצות</span><span class="font5">, “for six consecutive days you&nbsp;must eat unleavened bread;” this too is basically a repetition&nbsp;as the commandment to eat unleavened bread only during all&nbsp;the days of Passover has already been spelled out, so that&nbsp;this line adds only that whereas during six of these days the&nbsp;eating of bread is optional (unleavened bread only of&nbsp;course,) on the first day, when the Passover is being eaten to&nbsp;the accompaniment of the eating of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matza,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. eating&nbsp;“bread,” is mandatory. The subject of the pilgrimage to&nbsp;Jerusalem for Passover therefore is to be understood as&nbsp;follows: you will go up to Jerusalem no later than so that you&nbsp;time your arrival to be not later than noon, and having gotten&nbsp;rid of any </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chametz,</span><span class="font5"> something leavened, you proceed to&nbsp;slaughter your Passover lamb, and prepare it for&nbsp;consumption in the evening, and in the meantime you have&nbsp;baked your </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzot</span><span class="font5"> which does not take long. When you have&nbsp;performed all the rituals on that evening, you are free to&nbsp;leave Jerusalem in the morning, [if you live within the&nbsp;distance that travel is allowed on a festival. Ed.] During the&nbsp;remaining six days, when you feel the desire to eat bread,&nbsp;you may bake fresh </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matzot</span><span class="font5"> every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וביום השביעי</span><span class="font5">, “and on the seventh day;” this is the seventh day when you started counting from the night of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Seder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עצרת</span><span class="font5">, “shall be a solemn an assembly;” on that day you will abstain from all the activities that you have abstained&nbsp;from during the preceding six days. [This translation of the&nbsp;word: עצרת is borrowed from the commentary of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,9. שבעה שבעות, </span><span class="font5">“seven weeks;” the reason why this verse too is a kind of repetition, i.e. we had already heard&nbsp;that unleavened bread was to be eaten during the festival of&nbsp;Passover, after which seven weeks were to be counted, etc.&nbsp;in Leviticus 23,14-22, is that there is a new element here, i.e.&nbsp;that the count is to begin when the first offering of the new&nbsp;barley harvest, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">omer,</span><span class="font5"> is offered to G’d in the Temple. The&nbsp;validity of this law as a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Biblical</span><span class="font5"> law is related to the Jewish&nbsp;people living on their own land at that time. (Compare verse&nbsp;11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,10. ועשית חג שבועות</span><span class="font5">, “you will keep the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">festival</span><span class="font5"> of weeks;” the author refers to his commentary on the&nbsp;significance of this festival in Leviticus chapter 23, where he&nbsp;explained why the Torah did not give us a </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">date</span><span class="font5"> for when this&nbsp;festival is to be observed, as opposed to all the other&nbsp;festivals where the month and days they are to be observed&nbsp;have been spelled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,12. וזכרת כי עבד היית במצרים, </span><span class="font5">“you are to remember that you used to be a slave in Egypt.” It is noteworthy that&nbsp;this festival, as opposed to Passover, New Year’s Day&nbsp;fasting on the day of Atonement, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot,</span><span class="font5"> is not&nbsp;accompanied by specific rituals which are to serve as such&nbsp;reminders. This is why it was necessary for the Torah here to&nbsp;tell us that we must remember the significance of this day&nbsp;without </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">visible</span><span class="font5"> reminders of its significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי עבד היית במצרים</span><span class="font5">; “the Torah reminds you that your preoccupation with bringing in the wheat harvest at this time&nbsp;is not to be considered as more important than a pilgrimage&nbsp;to Jerusalem, for if the Lord had not taken you out of&nbsp;bondage in Egypt you would not have a crop to harvest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While you had been in Egypt you did not have an opportunity to rest and enjoy a festival, so doing once you&nbsp;have taken up residence in your own country is by itself a&nbsp;fitting reminder of how your status has changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,13. חג הסוכות, </span><span class="font5">“the festival of huts;” this has also&nbsp;been repeated on account of the words: “in the place that the&nbsp;Lord will choose, i.e. Jerusalem.” (verse 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באספך מגרנך</span><span class="font5">, “when you have gathered in from your threshing grounds;” into your house;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומיקבך</span><span class="font5">, “and from your wine-press,” into the storage vats.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושמחת בחגך</span><span class="font5">, “you shall rejoice on your festival;”&nbsp;“rejoicing” has been mentioned already in connection with&nbsp;the festival of weeks (verse 11); The reason why it was&nbsp;mentioned there is that it is the period of harvesting a major&nbsp;part of the grain harvest. (Isaiah 9,2.) At the time of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">such joy is increased greatly as everything that the fields and&nbsp;orchards produce is now being gathered in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Joy is not mentioned in connection with Passover as the season of ingathering produce has not yet started.&nbsp;Furthermore” we have been taught in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Rosh&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hashanah</span><span class="font5"> 16,1 that one of the four days on which the world&nbsp;is being judged concerning the produce for the coming year&nbsp;is Passover. In other words, the fate of the harvest still hangs&nbsp;in the balance, and it would be premature to rejoice&nbsp;therefore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שבעת ימים תחוג, </span><span class="font5">“you are to celebrate for seven&nbsp;days;” seeing that in the days before Passover you have&nbsp;been very preoccupied with its preparations, as well as the&nbsp;harvesting of the barley crop, and in the days preceding&nbsp;Pentecost you have been pre-occupied with harvesting the&nbsp;wheat crop, I bothered you with an interruption of only one&nbsp;day. By the time </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot</span><span class="font5"> arrives, your harvests have all been&nbsp;brought safely under a roof so that you did not have much to&nbsp;distract you, you can afford to enjoy this festival for seven&nbsp;days without having concerns of a secular nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: seeing that you have to bring a lot from your home to Jerusalem, you had already&nbsp;gathered it all into your house in preparation for the journey.&nbsp;It will take you seven days to consume all this, as opposed to&nbsp;Passover and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot</span><span class="font5"> when you do not bring so much with&nbsp;you to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation: Seeing that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph </span><span class="font5">offerings are different each day, this festival is actually like&nbsp;seven festivals of one day each. This is why this festival is&nbsp;different from the seven days known as חג המצות, “the festival&nbsp;of unleavened breads.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שבעת ימים תחוג</span><span class="font5">, “you shall celebrate for seven days; but the eighth day is a special day, the final day; it does not need&nbsp;to be spelled out here. It is as if with the conclusion of the&nbsp;seventh day the eighth day commences automatically. [Our&nbsp;author mentions this as in Leviticus chapter 23 the eighth day&nbsp;has been given special mention as if it were part of the first&nbsp;seven days. Ed.] The fact is that that day has not been&nbsp;mentioned either in connection with the pilgrimage festivals&nbsp;in Exodus chapter 23 or in Exodus chapter 34. [The simplest&nbsp;reason is that the people observing that day have already&nbsp;been in Jerusalem for seven days and do not have to travel&nbsp;there now again. Ed.] On every occasion when the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">offerings are mentioned, the eighth day is mentioned also, as&nbsp;it has a different offering, (as in Leviticus 23,36. and&nbsp;Numbers 29,35.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיית אך שמח</span><span class="font5">, “and you shall be altogether joyful.” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> we learn from this formulation that also&nbsp;the night of the eighth day is included in the time for active&nbsp;enjoyment. In other words, although days begin at nightfall,&nbsp;in this instance the last day is perceived as an extension of&nbsp;the seven previous days. On the other hand, the period of&nbsp;such joyfulness is not part of the evening of the first day as it&nbsp;has not been preceded by an especially joyful day. This has&nbsp;been spelled out in the Talmud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The plain meaning of the text, however, is that seeing that by now all the produce produced by the fields and the&nbsp;orchards have been harvested and put into storage your joy&nbsp;is complete. This is also why in connection with Passover,&nbsp;when none of this is the case, the Torah permits the pilgrims&nbsp;to return home on the day following the first day of the&nbsp;festival, i.e. the 16<sup>th</sup> day of Nissan. This is in spite of the fact&nbsp;that the duration of that festival is seven days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">16,16. שלש פעמים בשנה</span><span class="font5">, “three times annually;” why did this have to be repeated? In order that you should not say&nbsp;that seeing that when the Torah writes about the festival of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot</span><span class="font5"> in verse 11: “you shall rejoice in the presence of the&nbsp;Lord your G’d, you, your son and your daughter, your male&nbsp;servant as well as your female servant;” that one must take&nbsp;along one’s domestic animals also, whereas on the Passover&nbsp;festival when no mention has been made of joy, the father&nbsp;need not take along his family, and the Torah had spoken of&nbsp;“all your males,” the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">sons</span><span class="font5"> have to be taken along on each of&nbsp;these festivals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the instruction had to be repeated as we might have thought that the commandment&nbsp;not to appear before G’d empty-handed which is written only&nbsp;here and in connection with Passover, also applies on the&nbsp;third pilgrimage festival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">*כל זכורן</span><span class="font5">, “all of your males;” the law applies to all those who are able to make the journey with your males, i.e. not&nbsp;including people whose vocation is such that their very&nbsp;presence is so offensive due to the way they smell, for&nbsp;instance, that they would not be allowed to present&nbsp;themselves before a temporal king either, far less before the&nbsp;King of Kings. The details of these restrictions have been&nbsp;spelled out in the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chagigah 4,1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בחג המצות ובחג השבועות, </span><span class="font5">on the festival of unleavened breads and the festival of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Shavuot;</span><span class="font5"> the Torah compares&nbsp;these two festivals to one another as both allow for offering&nbsp;the specific gift offerings at a later occasion if the party who&nbsp;has to offer it has been prevented from doing so through&nbsp;circumstances beyond his control. This period lasts for seven&nbsp;days. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah</span><span class="font5"> 4,2.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובחג הסוכות</span><span class="font5">, “and on the festival of huts;” the reason that it has been named here separately is only to show that it is&nbsp;the last of the string of festivals.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font5">Parshat Shoftim</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">16.18. שופטים ושוטרים תתן לך בכל שעריך, “Judges and policemen shall you provide for yourselves in all your gates;”&nbsp;this paragraph has been inserted in the Torah at this point in&nbsp;order to tell you that although you are obligated to travel to&nbsp;the place where the priests and Levites reside all year three&nbsp;times a year and you can submit all your legal problems to&nbsp;them on those occasions, this is not sufficient, but you must&nbsp;have judges and enforcers in all your towns (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">16.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תטה משפט ולא תקח שוחד, “do not pervert&nbsp;judgment, nor accept any bribe;” earlier in Exodus 23,6 the&nbsp;subject of not perverting judgment when destitute people are&nbsp;before the court has already been discussed; now it is&nbsp;addressed to the people as a whole. [The people addressed&nbsp;are primarily the judges. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ולא תקח שוחד, do not even accept a bribe in order to pass fair judgment. Bribing judges in order for them not to&nbsp;pervert justice has already been forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ויסלף, “nor pervert,” we find this root used in the same sense in Proverbs 11,3: וסלף בוגדים ישדם, “but the perversity of&nbsp;the treacherous will destroy them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">דברי צדיקים, “the words of the righteous.” Here the Torah refers to the litigants, not the judges. Compare Deuteronomy&nbsp;25,1: והצדיקו את הצדיק, “by justifying the righteous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">16.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;צדק צדק תרדוף, “Justice, Justice, you are to&nbsp;pursue;” here too the Torah addresses the litigants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">16.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תטע לך אשרה, “do not plant for yourself an&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">asherah;</span><span class="font5"> even if that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">asherah</span><span class="font5"> was not meant to be used as a&nbsp;place of worship. When conflicting claims face a judge, and&nbsp;he has to decide with which claims to deal with first, he is to&nbsp;deal with any matter that involves idolatry first. The term&nbsp;describes trees at the entrance to house of worship. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">understands the verse as prohibiting the planting of a tree or&nbsp;house on the Temple Mount. The words: לא תטע, would refer&nbsp;to the former, and the words: כל עץ, would refer to someone&nbsp;building a house, i.e. even from wood that is not fit to&nbsp;become a tree, having been cut and then re-assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">אצל מזבח, “next to an altar;” it was a common practice for the pagans to do this. This has been explained in Judges</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">6,25. Furthermore, the purpose of not allowing such trees in&nbsp;such locations was to prevent people seeing someone going&nbsp;there from thinking that that individual was on his way to&nbsp;worshipping an idol. Jeremiah 17,2, describes such worship&nbsp;of an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">asherah</span><span class="font5"> as a widely accepted practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תזבח, “do not slaughter as a sacrifice, etc.;”&nbsp;After having prohibited sacrificing to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">idols,</span><span class="font5"> the Torah&nbsp;proceeds to prohibit defective, blemished, animals to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Lord our</span><span class="font5"> G’d, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ימצא, “if there will be found amongst you, etc.;”&nbsp;now the Torah addresses individual Israelites who may&nbsp;become guilty of idolatry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אל שעריך, “to your gates;” according to the plain&nbsp;meaning of the text “the gates” is the place where the court&nbsp;sits in judgment. The location has been chosen as it is so&nbsp;central and public that any accused cannot avoid passing it&nbsp;for any length of time, at which time the judges will arrest the&nbsp;accused for a hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find an illustration of this in the Book of Ruth, (Ruth 4,1) when the potential redeemer of Ruth is accosted by&nbsp;Boaz in such a square.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">וסקלתם באבנים, “you shall stone them with stones;” males or females as the case may be; we find a similar&nbsp;formula when the penalty is death by burning (swallowing&nbsp;molten lead) (Leviticus 20,14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יומת המת, “he that has to die shall be executed;”&nbsp;we find similar constructions in Genesis 48,21, concerning&nbsp;Yaakov and Joseph, הנה אנכי מת, “here I am dead;” and in&nbsp;Deuteronomy 31,27, where Moses describes a situation after&nbsp;his death,ואף גם אחרי מותי, “and also after my death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">לא יומת על פי עד אחד, “he must not be executed on the basis of the testimony of only one witness.” If you were to&nbsp;ask what news this verse contains, after all a single witness&nbsp;cannot bring about a conviction even if the case involves only</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">a possible fine! [something reversible if proven to have been based on a false testimony. Ed.] How much more&nbsp;impossible is it to convict someone of a capital crime based&nbsp;on the testimony of only one witness! We would have to&nbsp;answer that seeing that the crime carrying a death penalty is&nbsp;so severe, surely the testimony of one witness is sufficient, if&nbsp;the penalty is to be a deterrent. The Torah does not accept&nbsp;this kind of reasoning and insists on at least two eye&nbsp;witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">והוגד לך ושמעת, since in verse 4 the Torah had written that the commission of the crime of idolatry had been so well&nbsp;known that you had heard about it, and it had been accepted&nbsp;as fact, the Torah insists that this is not the basis of&nbsp;convicting someone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[One of the reasons that the Torah insists on this is that even if no witnesses were prepared to testify to what they are&nbsp;known to have seen, G’d will punish the accused sinner for&nbsp;what he did, even if a panel of human judges was unable to&nbsp;do so for technical reasons. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17,8. כי יפלא ממך דבר, “if there is a matter which is too difficult for you. [a local court, Ed.] The word יפלא is similar in&nbsp;meaning to the word יתכסה, “hidden;” The word belongs to a&nbsp;category of words that can have two meanings depending on&nbsp;the context in which it appears. We find the phrase כי יפליא&nbsp;נדר, (Leviticus 27,2) “when someone </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">clearly</span><span class="font5"> utters a vow;” on&nbsp;the other hand we find כי יפליא לנדור, (Numbers 6,2) “when&nbsp;someone makes a vow to deny himself something. The&nbsp;author cites more examples.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ממך דבר, “the Torah addresses a specific judge who is unable to determine whether the accused in a capital case&nbsp;deserves the death penalty. The Torah lists three different&nbsp;categories of subjects in which the judge in question does&nbsp;not feel competent to hand down a ruling. [All three&nbsp;categories are subjects for which the priests are the proper&nbsp;address to give rulings. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17,9 ובאת אל הכהן, “and you come to the priest, etc.” This verse is a clear example to the scholars who maintain&nbsp;that the written Torah was to be interpreted literally and that&nbsp;there is no parallel oral Torah. If there were no such oral&nbsp;Torah, the most competent scholars of which reside in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jerusalem, what would be the point of travelling to Jerusalem for clarification?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17,12. העומד לשרת, (to the priest) “the one who stands to minister;” the reason the Torah adds the word: העומד, is to&nbsp;teach that service in the Temple, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ritual</span><span class="font5"> service generally,&nbsp;must be performed while standing. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שום תשים, “be sure to appoint for yourself!” Once&nbsp;the Torah mentions the authority of judges, it also describes&nbsp;the limitations imposed on the ruler, the first one being that&nbsp;he must be appointed with the approval of G’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'אשר יבחר ה, “whom the Lord will choose;” how do we know that the King has been chosen by the Lord? He will be&nbsp;chosen by the foremost prophet at that time, or in the&nbsp;absence of prophets, through consultation by the High Priest&nbsp;with G’d by means of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">urim vetumim,</span><span class="font5"> the parchment in a&nbsp;pocket beneath the High Priest’s breastplate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">לא תוכל, “you are legally forbidden, hence “unable;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">לתת עליך איש נכרי, “you may not appoint over yourself a foreigner.” The reason for this is that a foreigner may wish to&nbsp;impose his religion upon you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וה׳ אמר לכם לא תוסיפו, “seeing that the Lord has&nbsp;said to you (not to return to Egypt to reside there).” (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזהב לא ירבה לו, “and he is not to amass gold for&nbsp;himself.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> understands this imprecise instruction to&nbsp;mean that he must not amass more gold than necessary in&nbsp;order to pay the wages of his soldiers. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מלפני הכהנים, “a copy of the original retained by&nbsp;the priests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">17,20. לבלתי רום לבבו מאחיו, “so as not to lift his heart above that of his brethren.” This is the reason why the king&nbsp;must not amass material wealth mentioned in verse 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ולבלתי סור מן המצוה, “and in order not to turn aside from the commandment;” this is the reason why the King must&nbsp;always have a Torah scroll with him from which he is to read&nbsp;daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">למען יאריך ימים, “so that he may prolong his life;” it is a well known fact that the burden of high office is bound to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">shorten the life of the people charged with it. In order to counteract this, the Torah provides the King with an antidote,&nbsp;i.e. regular daily Torah study. This is also why when the King&nbsp;is crowned, the crowd welcomes him with the shout: יחי המלך.&nbsp;“long life to the King!” (Kings I 1,25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא יהיה לכהנים, “the priests (and Levites) shall not&nbsp;have (own);” after the Torah had spelled out details&nbsp;pertaining to Jewish Kings, it proceeds to do the same for the&nbsp;hereditary positions of priests and Levites. They are charged&nbsp;with teaching the people Torah, i.e. worrying about their&nbsp;spiritual welfare, whereas the King is charged with looking&nbsp;after their material well being. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why the priests and Levites will not own ancestral land in the Holy Land is that if they did they would&nbsp;neglect their primary task and tend their fields and orchards&nbsp;instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונחלה לא יהיה לו בקרב אחיו, “they shall have no&nbsp;inheritance among their brethren.” In the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> (according to&nbsp;the version at the disposal of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)</span><span class="font5"> the word נחלה is&nbsp;understood to refer to inherited land i.e. through being&nbsp;brothers only through the father’s side, whereas the words&nbsp;בקרב אחיו, would refer to brothers both from the same father&nbsp;and the same mother. [in other words the sons of Leah, Ed.]&nbsp;The Torah was forced to list these two categories separately,&nbsp;as if it had not included each category separately we might&nbsp;have thought that when their claim was based on being full&nbsp;brothers by sharing the same father and mother they would&nbsp;qualify for such an inheritance. [In order for this to make&nbsp;sense, we would have to distinguish between ancestral land&nbsp;allocations made by Moses during his lifetime, and that made&nbsp;by Joshua. Once the land had been distributed and settled&nbsp;no questions could arise, as Levites had been born to Levites&nbsp;and priests to priests, and neither had a father who had left&nbsp;him his ancestral share of the land. The versions of this </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">are confusing and who are we to determine the correct&nbsp;version? Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזה יהיה משפט הכהנים “and this will be the priests’&nbsp;due;” after denying the priests ancestral land, the Torah&nbsp;proceeds to tell us how the priests were compensated. They&nbsp;receive the foreleg as payment for performing the slaughter;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">they receive the cheekbones as payment for blessing the people, and they receive the stomach as reward for&nbsp;performing the examinations required to make sure that the&nbsp;animal was not blemished internally. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 136)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18,4. ראשית דגנך, “the first fruit of your grain harvest;” According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the average amount donated to the&nbsp;priests from this harvest was 2%. This is based on a verse&nbsp;describing how the loot from the campaign against Midian&nbsp;was shared out. (Numbers 31,47) Why was this repeated&nbsp;once more, when it had already been repeated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The donation called תרומה גדולה, to describe the first donation,” was called such called by this adjective was&nbsp;because it is the largest of the gifts the farmer has to make or&nbsp;to allow to remain in the field, uncut. How do we arrive at&nbsp;such a statement, when on the face of it the tithe of a tenth of&nbsp;the harvest appears to be much more?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After deducting the 2% set aside from the harvest before any other deductions, the remaining 49 parcels of 2%&nbsp;each have to be divided into 50 equal amounts in order to set&nbsp;aside 5 parts of each as the tithe to be given to the Levite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">וראשית גז צאנך, “and the first of the fleece of your sheep.” According to the view of Rabbi Ila-i this had to be done only&nbsp;in respect of sheep raised in the land of Israel. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Chulin</span><span class="font5"> 136)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">צאנך, “your sheep or goats;” this excludes animals which prove inedible due to faulty slaughter or diseased part&nbsp;discovered afterwards which would have led to the death of&nbsp;this animal within less than 12 months, in other words: an&nbsp;animal that was </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">treif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">תתן לו, “you are to give to him” (one or more of the priests who is on duty during that roster (usually a week,&nbsp;except during the pilgrimage festivals when all the priests we&nbsp;equally entitled to share in this). The expression תתן, i.e.&nbsp;something valuable enough to qualify for the term מתנה, “gift,”&nbsp;led to the peculiar system where if you lived in the tribal&nbsp;territory of Yehudah, you were required to give only 5 shekel&nbsp;worth, as opposed to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">galil</span><span class="font5"> (northern section of Israel) you&nbsp;had to give the priest twice as much. (as only then would&nbsp;people in that part of the country consider that amount as a&nbsp;“gift.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18,6. וכי יבא הלוי, “and if a Levite comes, etc.” the Levites are mentioned after the priests as they too have been&nbsp;charged with teaching the people the Torah, [and the fact&nbsp;that they do not have to work the land makes them free to do&nbsp;so. Ed.] Their task has been spelled out clearly in Chronicles&nbsp;II 17,7-9; in fact, we see there that they were travelling&nbsp;teachers, leaving the towns set aside for the Levites and&nbsp;visiting small communities in order to teach there. This is the&nbsp;plain meaning of the words as written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18,8. חלק כחלק יאכלו, “they shall eat (receive) equal shares, etc.” when we were told in Samuel I 2,36 that the&nbsp;sons of the High Priest Eli would have to go begging to get a&nbsp;morsel to eat, from which we see that even as priests they&nbsp;did not get their allotted shares, and from which we also&nbsp;know that allocations were based only on service actually&nbsp;performed in the Temple, we must remember that these&nbsp;offspring of Eli described there had not yet attained the age&nbsp;at which they were fit to perform such service, i.e. they were&nbsp;below thirty years of age. This is clear from what is written in&nbsp;Samuel I 2,33. [There they were destined not to die until they&nbsp;had attained full maturity, i.e. the age at which, but for the&nbsp;curse, they could have performed Temple service. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">לבד ממכריו, “beside what is due to them as a result of his having sold the house he had inherited from his parents.”&nbsp;[The fact that therefore he had independent means and did&nbsp;not need to go begging was not taken into consideration by&nbsp;the Torah when it legislated what he was entitled to due to&nbsp;having been born a Levite.]’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of this phrase: the word ממכריו is derived from מכיר, “knowing someone personally.”&nbsp;The Torah tells us if the Levite in question has friends who&nbsp;are willing to give him handouts from the goodness of their&nbsp;hearts, this does not therefore prevent him from claiming&nbsp;what is due and sharing it with his fellow Levites. This is so&nbsp;even if he does not ask for his share during the week his&nbsp;roster ids performing the service in the Temple. [This is an&nbsp;important piece of legislation, as the Rabbis stipulated that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">when someone has independent means, even minimal amounts, he is not entitled to ask for handouts. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.9. 'כי אתה בא אל הארץ וגו, “when you will come to the land, etc.” After the Torah had told you what type of authority&nbsp;the priests and the King possess, and that you must be&nbsp;obedient to them, it now tells you what kind of instructions&nbsp;you must disobey, if such are decreed by them. You are to&nbsp;record those in writing also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'לא ימצא בך מעביר בנו באש וגו, “there must not be&nbsp;found amongst you any father who makes his son pass&nbsp;through fire, etc.” Where is the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">penalty</span><span class="font5"> for such abuse of&nbsp;parental authority written? It is found in the otherwise&nbsp;superfluous words: אשר מזרעו, “from his offspring,” in Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20,2, where the same subject has been discussed already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">קוסם קסמים, “someone using divination to learn about future events;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> an example of divination&nbsp;would be if a person takes hold of his walking cane, asking it&nbsp;if it is in his interest to undertake a certain journey. The&nbsp;subject appears also in Hoseah 4,12, although no examples&nbsp;are given how the cane would give its sign. [Some&nbsp;commentators therefore do not understand the word:&nbsp;“walking cane” literally, but see it as a synonym for an idol&nbsp;made of wood. The idol would be asked and give some sign&nbsp;to the questioner. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ושואל אוב וידעוני, “or consulting a ghost or familiar&nbsp;spirit.” According to the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 65,&nbsp;the people referred to are those who pretend that they can&nbsp;produce answers by consulting carcasses or skeletons, and&nbsp;producing what sounds like responses to their questions that&nbsp;appear to emanate between the joints of the bones of the&nbsp;dead. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> quotes a different version of this kind of trickery.&nbsp;The point is that through appearing to be able to&nbsp;communicate with the dead, these people presumably make&nbsp;a good living by misleading their naive customers. All of this&nbsp;kind of necromancy is punishable by death if performed by a&nbsp;Jewish person in Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובגלל התועבות האלה מוריש אותם מפניך, “on account&nbsp;of the previous inhabitants of this land having performed all&nbsp;of these abominations the Lord is dispossessing them of this&nbsp;land.” Their expulsion is proof that their protectors were&nbsp;powerless, so why would you even think of turning to such&nbsp;means for knowing the future? As a result of this failure of&nbsp;the idols G’d suggests that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תמים תהיה עם ה' אלוקיך, “be wholehearted with the&nbsp;Lord your G’d.” The expression תמימות, means “to have an&nbsp;exclusive relationship with either man or G’d.” One does not&nbsp;flirt with any alternatives. The opposite of this occurred with&nbsp;the nations that were made to live in Israel as exchange for&nbsp;the Ten Tribes which the Assyrians had exiled. They&nbsp;professed to worship the Jewish way of life, but without&nbsp;abandoning their own religion. As a result, they became&nbsp;victims of the lions invading their part of the Land of Israel.&nbsp;(Compare Kings II 17,33)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי הגוים האלה, “for these nations, etc.” The nations&nbsp;that you are about to dispossess if they do not emigrate, or to&nbsp;kill outright, had a need to turn to all these pseudo prophets&nbsp;or healers seeing that they have no direct line of&nbsp;communication with the Lord G’d, their Creator. I have&nbsp;provided you with a prophet similar in stature to Moses, G’d&nbsp;has said. He said nothing of the kind to the Canaanites.&nbsp;(verse 15) G’d first listed the King, then the Judges, and&nbsp;finally the Prophets, as means of communicating with Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.15. מאחיך כמוני, “from amongst your brethren, someone like me;” Moses refers to Joshua in this verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">אליו משמעון, “you are to be obedient to him.” Compare what is written in Deuteronomy 34,9, “all the Israelites&nbsp;listened to him” (were obedient).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא אוסף, “I do not wish to continue, etc.” Moses&nbsp;refers to when, during the revelation at Mount Sinai 39 years&nbsp;earlier, the people who had been listening to G’d’s voice&nbsp;directly, had found that voice so frightening that they asked&nbsp;Moses to be their go-between. (Exodus 20,16)The letter ס in&nbsp;the word אוסף has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzeyreh;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18,22. ולא יהיה הדבר ולא יבא, “and that thing will not come to pass; it will not happen;” for instance, if that “prophet” had&nbsp;promised that an impending disaster will be averted, or if he&nbsp;had promised something positive, that something will not&nbsp;occur;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jonah was afraid of being labelled a false prophet when Nineveh was not destroyed as he had predicted. [He had not&nbsp;told the people that penitence was a remedy that would be&nbsp;the reason through which it could be averted. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate explanation for the apparent repetition in our verse: the prediction would not come true at the time&nbsp;promised nor would it come true sometime later. This could&nbsp;be taken as proof that it would never come true. In&nbsp;Deuteronomy 13,3, when the same subject is discussed, the&nbsp;Torah writes about the “prophet’s” prediction coming true.&nbsp;How are we to account for the difference? Here the Torah&nbsp;speaks about a charlatan, someone who had never been a&nbsp;prophet; there the Torah speaks of someone who had been&nbsp;known as a true prophet in the past but had become a&nbsp;heretic, so that what he had predicted lately had not been&nbsp;something that G’d had told him about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי יכרית, “When the Lord shall cut off, etc.” after&nbsp;Moses had dealt with the subject of impostors of different&nbsp;kinds, he now turns to the subject of cleansing the earth of&nbsp;the Holy Land of any vestiges of idolatry left behind by its&nbsp;former inhabitants. It must also be cleaned of traces of blood&nbsp;spilled that had belonged to innocent people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שלש ערים, “three cities, etc.; the people had&nbsp;already been commanded concerning these cities of refuge&nbsp;in Numbers 35,14, and the only reason this is repeated here&nbsp;again is to add the instruction to the population to erect&nbsp;signposts for the benefit of the people searching for such a&nbsp;city in order to escape the wrath of a blood avenger of the&nbsp;slain victim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תכין לך הדרך, “prepare the way for yourself;” the&nbsp;route to such cities of refuge should not be a narrow path,&nbsp;etc., but a road that is easy to travel, and has been marked&nbsp;clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Avin, son of Rabbi Yaakov, is quoted in a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> on Psalms 25,10 describing how every mile or so,&nbsp;there were markers how to get to these cities, and in every&nbsp;kiosk, there were directional signals identifying the route.&nbsp;[The purpose was not only for the killer to know how to get to&nbsp;such cities, but to remind the people at large to be careful&nbsp;never to become guilty of killing through negligence. Ed.]&nbsp;This was hinted at two verses earlier in the same chapter of&nbsp;Psalms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ושלשת את גבול ארצך, “so that you will effectively divide the borders of your country into three segments;” how did this&nbsp;work out in practice? The Land of Israel was 400 miles long&nbsp;(from south to north) It was about 100 miles from Chevron to&nbsp;Sh’chem, and from there to Kadesh another 100 miles. The&nbsp;three cities of refuge therefore symbolically divided the land&nbsp;into three sections. You will note that the center section&nbsp;therefore was shorter than the northern and southern section&nbsp;respectively. This is accounted for in the minds of the sages&nbsp;by the fact that both Chevron and Sh’chem were cities in&nbsp;which a lot of bloodshed occurred. They quote a verse in&nbsp;Hosea 6,9, as supporting their interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כל רוצח, “every murderer, regardless of intentional or unintentional.” We explained this already on Numbers 35,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19,4. את רעהו, “his neighbour;” the word את here is to be&nbsp;understood as meaning: עם, “with;” (while together with him).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">בבלי דעת, “without intent;” these words are meant to exclude someone who did intend to kill his animal, but&nbsp;instead killed a human being. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Makkot</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19,5. הוא ינוס אל אחת הערים האל וחי, “he will flee to one of these cities and live.” The population of these towns is&nbsp;deliberately limited, so that a potential blood avenger cannot&nbsp;hide in large crowds and carry out his plan undetected.&nbsp;(Talmud </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Makkot,</span><span class="font5"> folio 10) The city fathers see to it that the&nbsp;persons consigned there will have employment or work&nbsp;enabling them to make a living. If a Torah scholar has the&nbsp;misfortune to have to reside there, his teacher is brought&nbsp;there and looked after also. If he is himself a Rabbi of a&nbsp;Torah academy, his students are brought to him to live there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19,6. והכהו נפש, “and strike him fatally;” there is a word&nbsp;missing in this phrase, i.e. the word מכת “a blow;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ולו אין משפט מות, “while he was not deserving of the death penalty;” this teaches that even an intentional killer&nbsp;who has not been sentenced to death by the court (for some&nbsp;technical reason connected to the evidence presumably)&nbsp;may still be subject to death at the hands of the blood&nbsp;avenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וטוב לך, “that it may go well with you,” so that the&nbsp;number of people guilty of bloodshed may not increase in&nbsp;your land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תסיג, “do not remove, etc.;” the reason why&nbsp;this legislation has been written here [when on the face of it,&nbsp;it is not related to what preceded it. Ed.] is that most serious&nbsp;disagreements resulting in bloodshed have their origin in&nbsp;disputes over borders. This is why immediately afterwards&nbsp;we also have the line: “an eye for an eye, a life for a life etc.”&nbsp;(verse 21). We also have the warning not to convict anyone&nbsp;on the basis of the testimony of only a single witness. (Verse&nbsp;15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">אשר גבלו ראשונים, “which (the borders) have been marked by earlier generations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא יקום עד אחד באיש, “one witness shall not rise up&nbsp;against a man;” as written here it appears as if this restriction&nbsp;applies only in cases involving a possible death sentence;&nbsp;how do we know that it applies also in matters involving only&nbsp;damages of a financial nature? This is why the Torah adds:&nbsp;לכל עון, “concerning any sin;” how do I know that it applies&nbsp;even in matters involving ritual matters, sacrifices? This is&nbsp;why the Torah added: בכל חטא אשר יחטא, “concerning any sin&nbsp;that he may become guilty of,” between man and G’d or&nbsp;between man and man. How do I know it applies also&nbsp;concerning any misdemeanor? This is why the Torah had&nbsp;commenced with the comprehensive words: לכל עון.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19,19. ועשיתם לו כאשר זמם, “you will do to him in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">accordance with the penalty that he had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">planned</span><span class="font5"> for his victim to be convicted of. The Torah has taught the penalty&nbsp;here; where is the prohibition to commit such a crime&nbsp;written? See Exodus 23,1 as well as at the ninth of the Ten&nbsp;Commandments in Exodus 20,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">19,21. ולא תחוס עינך, “and your eye shall not display pity.” You shall not have pity with the guilty person; on the&nbsp;other hand, even during war time you shall display pity on&nbsp;people who are in the process of building their homes for the&nbsp;first time, be it that they are engaged to be married, that they&nbsp;are in the middle of building a house, or planting an orchard.&nbsp;The Torah teaches you a lesson here of when it is&nbsp;appropriate to display pity and concern, and when not. This&nbsp;is why these two paragraphs one dealing with expansionist&nbsp;wars, the other about people undermining faith in the Lord of&nbsp;their brethren, follow one another in the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">עין בעין, “an eye for an eye, etc.;” the Torah once more repeats that justice must be based on the punishment fitting&nbsp;the crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ה' אלוקיך עמך, “for the Lord your G’d is with you.”&nbsp;The Torah refers to the Holy Ark, and the trumpets, both of&nbsp;which are instruments representing the presence of the Lord&nbsp;among the Jewish people which will give them courage when&nbsp;fighting a war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיה כקרבכם אל המלחמה, “and it will be when you will&nbsp;be close to the battle, etc.” once the soldiers have&nbsp;approached the borders of the enemy, before actually&nbsp;engaging him in battle, Moses informs them of all the&nbsp;conditions which must be observed during active warfare.&nbsp;They are, of course, reserved for the men actually engaged&nbsp;in the fighting. This is clear from the wording in verse three,&nbsp;where only those men are being addressed. Seeing that the&nbsp;Torah speaks not of a defensive war, but of a war designed&nbsp;to enlarge the borders of Israel, -with the approval of G’d- of&nbsp;course;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ונגש הכהן ודבר אל העם, “the priest shall approach and address the people. The soldiers are being addressed&nbsp;separately by the priest, representing the spiritual voice of&nbsp;the people, and the mundane authorities, officers, charged&nbsp;with ensuring success in battle, According to the Talmud,&nbsp;what is written from the words: ונגש in verse three, until verse&nbsp;five, when the secular authorities the commander continues.&nbsp;[There are different opinions about these sequences. Seeing&nbsp;that we cannot prove which is correct, it does not pay to go&nbsp;into further details. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20,3. אל תיראו, “do not be afraid;” these words address the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ואל תחפזו, “and do not be alarmed,” resulting in fleeing;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ואל תערצו, “and do not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">display</span><span class="font5"> fear, [even if you feel it. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר בנה, “who has built;” the Torah here teaches&nbsp;the correct order in which young men are to approach the&nbsp;subject of matrimony; first they have to make a commitment&nbsp;to the woman they have chosen; then they have to provide&nbsp;for their bride a place to live in; then they have to establish a&nbsp;sound economic base, such as planting a vineyard. Having&nbsp;done so, they may proceed to complete the wedding&nbsp;ceremonies. The reason why such people are excused from&nbsp;fighting in an expansionary war, is that their worries about if&nbsp;they will be able to complete their plans for the future will&nbsp;distract them from performing their military duties to the best&nbsp;of their abilities. They will worry that in spite of promises from&nbsp;G’d they may be or have been guilty of sins which will be&nbsp;used by G’d to withdraw His protection from them when they&nbsp;are facing danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ילך וישוב לביתו פן ימות, “he would not be much use in battle if he is too preoccupied with his personal concerns.” As&nbsp;to the fainthearted soldiers, they are excused so that their&nbsp;low morale does not infect and undermine the confidence of&nbsp;their comrades in arms. Therefore they are best sent home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">יחנכנו, “will dedicate it.” The letter ח in this word has the semi vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’va</span><span class="font5"> under it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא חללו, “and has not been able to enjoy the fruit&nbsp;of it.” The word describes dancing of a kind. It was customary&nbsp;at the end of the fourth year after planting a vineyard for the&nbsp;owner to give a party seeing that up to then the fruit of that&nbsp;vineyard was not at his free disposal. (Compare Judges</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21,21, about the daughters of Shiloh.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מי האיש הירא, “who is the man who is afraid?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first part of this verse speaks about people whose fear is based on becoming the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">victim</span><span class="font5"> of painful injuries, or&nbsp;worse. The second part of the verse describing “fear,”&nbsp;speaks of someone who is uncomfortable about having to&nbsp;inflict pain, injury or worse, on opponents that have never&nbsp;done him any harm or even threatened to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such a person is described by the Torah as</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">רך הלבב, “faint hearted.” (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ילך וישוב לביתו, “let him go and return to his house.” He is not released from </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font5"> duty, but is assigned to support the&nbsp;troops in the frontline by keeping the lengthening lines of&nbsp;supply open. This is as opposed to the previous three&nbsp;categories of mobilized men, who are released from any&nbsp;participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Any war which involves defending the land of Israel against an invasion by Gentiles is to be resisted without any&nbsp;reservations such as listed above. In fact, according to the&nbsp;Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 44, even a bridegroom just&nbsp;after the vows have been completed must join his unit to&nbsp;defend the country and its people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ופקדו, “and they shall appoint, etc.” This takes&nbsp;place after all those that have been allowed to return home&nbsp;have done so. The use of the root פקד to describe making&nbsp;appointments is first found in the advice Joseph gave to&nbsp;Pharaoh in Genesis 41,34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20,11.למס ועבדוך, “shall become liable to be taxed by you and become subservient.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explained that it is&nbsp;sufficient that they make an oral declaration to do so. Seeing&nbsp;that some of their cities may be a long distance away from&nbsp;you, it is unlikely that they will teach you and your children&nbsp;their pagan culture; this is why the rule that you must not&nbsp;allow a soul to survive in the lands captured by Joshua does&nbsp;not need to be applied in such situations as described here.&nbsp;Conversion to Judaism by any of the members of the seven</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Canaanite nations whose territory would form the first Jewish state is out of the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תחיה כל נשמה, “you must not allow to remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">for anyone to be &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alive;” if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you were to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">commandment, the survivors would stir up trouble internationally, even, over having been deprived of their&nbsp;ancestral land. The validity of this commandment is limited to&nbsp;the generation Moses is addressing, i.e. the period during&nbsp;which the Israelites will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engaged in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fighting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Canaanites in order to settle in the land promised by G’d to their patriarchs, Avraham, Yitzchok, and Yaakov. If members&nbsp;of these tribes had emigrated voluntarily, and at some future&nbsp;date return individually, and even wish to convert to Judaism&nbsp;this is acceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to this interpretation,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Israelites under Joshua did not sin when they accepted the conversion of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Givonim,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even though&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">misrepresented themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20.17. כי החרם תחרימם, “but you shall utterly destroy&nbsp;them.” You might think that also their belongings would be&nbsp;out of bounds to you, (as the booty from Jericho); in order to&nbsp;assure you that this is not so, the Torah wrote in Deut. 6,11,&nbsp;that you will capture (and keep) their houses and contents&nbsp;intact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20,19. כי תצור אל עיר ימים רבים , “when you lay siege to a city for a long time;” from this we learn that one does not lay&nbsp;siege to a city for less than three days before the Sabbath. If&nbsp;the city had been encircled and the Sabbath occurs before&nbsp;the city surrenders, this is not a reason to cease military&nbsp;activity on the Sabbath. This rule is one of three that the&nbsp;sage Shammai, (contemporary of Hillel) had stated. The&nbsp;three are: one does not engage in an ocean voyage less&nbsp;than three days before the Sabbath. This rule applies when&nbsp;the destination is further way than a three day voyage. If it&nbsp;closer, under normal circumstances, it may be undertaken&nbsp;closer to the Sabbath. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the rules concerning how to conduct a siege are valid only during expansionary wars. Defensive wars when&nbsp;the land of Israel has been attacked, are not subject to any of&nbsp;these restrictions. Such defensive action may be&nbsp;commenced on any day of the week</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">לא תשחית את עצה, “You must not destroy its (fruitbearing) trees;” this applies to trees near the town under siege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כי ממנו תאכל, “for you will be able to eat their fruit once you have conquered the town.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כי האדם עץ השדה, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the word כי here means :”perhaps” used as a question, i.e. “did you think&nbsp;perhaps that rules that apply to human beings are the same&nbsp;as those applying to fruit-bearing trees?” Why should the tree&nbsp;which is giving man of its fruit suffer and endure the&nbsp;hardships of the population of the town you have laid siege&nbsp;to? Seeing that these trees are not guilty of anything why&nbsp;would you destroy them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20,20. כי לא עץ מאכל הוא, “for it is not a tree providing&nbsp;food; the Torah suggests that once a fruit-bearing tree has&nbsp;reached a stage when it no longer bears fruit, it may be&nbsp;treated as if it had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span><span class="font5"> born fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation: you must not cut down any fruitbearing tree on the field; the exception are those trees that serve as cover for your enemies and help them escape you&nbsp;and continue in their fight against you. If such trees make it&nbsp;impossible for you to reach the walls of the city which you are&nbsp;besieging, you may remove such an obstacle by cutting it&nbsp;down even if it still does bear fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'רק עץ אשר תדע כי לא עץ מאכל הוא וגו, “only a category of tree of which you know that it does not bear edible fruit, you&nbsp;may destroy even it is far from the walls of the city which you&nbsp;are besieging.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why did this line have to be written here? If it is permissible to cut down a fruit-bearing tree under certain&nbsp;conditions, is it is not simple logic that you may cut down non&nbsp;fruit bearing trees? The answer is something that we have&nbsp;come across repeatedly. Punishment for a sin committed&nbsp;may </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span><span class="font5"> be imposed based only on logic. Unless the Torah&nbsp;has specifically spelled out such punishment, it is not for us&nbsp;human beings to determine appropriate penalties for violating&nbsp;laws made by the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: The text has to be understood literally, “Jt you must not cut down.” If you wish to&nbsp;understand the rationale: for man is similar to the tree of the&nbsp;field; for just as the people who lay siege to a city and the&nbsp;living beings inside are compared here to the tree of the field.&nbsp;In order to illustrate this better, let us compare it to&nbsp;Deuteronomy 24,6, כי נפש הוא חובל, “for this would be&nbsp;equivalent to taking that person’s life;” where the Torah&nbsp;compares vital household utensils taken by a creditor to&nbsp;secure his loan as the creditor taking the debtor’s life. The&nbsp;human being owing the money can continue to exist only as&nbsp;long as he is not deprived of these vital utensils. The fruitbearing trees around a city are similarly a basic utensil&nbsp;ensuring the inhabitants’ economic survival. Since the object&nbsp;of the siege is not to kill all its inhabitants,-but to make them&nbsp;subservient to you, depriving them of their fruit bearing trees&nbsp;would be neither in your interest and certainly not in their&nbsp;interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ימצא חלל, “if someone unidentifiable is found&nbsp;slain,” after the Torah discussed certain aspects of war&nbsp;between nations, it now turns to the result of individuals who&nbsp;had apparently fought one another and the victor had&nbsp;escaped as there had not been any witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כי ימצא חלל, “he had been found dead, the killer not having buried him;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">נופל בשדה, “lying in the field;” he was not hung from a tree; it is not customary for a murderer to take the time to&nbsp;hang his victim as he is busy hiding his identity as quickly as&nbsp;he is able to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the words: נופל בשדה: not floating on the surface of a body of water. There was no&nbsp;indication of where he might have come from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומדדו, ”they (the authorities) will measure;” even if&nbsp;it clear how far he is removed from the nearest habitation,&nbsp;the act of performing the measuring will draw the attention of&nbsp;the public to what has happened in their vicinity; the people&nbsp;of the neighbouring towns or villages will institute searches&nbsp;for any resident not accounted for so that the identity of the&nbsp;slain person may be established. If someone in the&nbsp;neighbouring towns has not been accounted for, the family&nbsp;members will come to inspect the carcass to determine if he&nbsp;was related to them. Through these searches it may be&nbsp;determined who might have kept company with the slain&nbsp;man, and if there was a woman in the vicinity whose&nbsp;husband had disappeared and who was therefore an&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">agunah,</span><span class="font5"> an abandoned woman unable to remarry until proof&nbsp;would forthcoming that her husband had died, and who could&nbsp;be able to remarry once the identity of the slain main was&nbsp;determined as having been her husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיה העיר, “and it shall be that the city, etc.;” it will&nbsp;be up to the elders of inhabitants of the site closest to where&nbsp;the slain person was found will take a female heifer of the&nbsp;herd, etc.;” the inverted use of the male pronoun for a female&nbsp;i.e. עבד “he was worked,” instead of: “she was worked,” is&nbsp;also found in Genesis 24,13, with the word: הנערה.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21.4. אל נחל </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">איתן</span><span class="font5">, “to a virgin piece of land of ancient origin;” we find this same expression also in Psalms 74,15:&nbsp;אתה הובשת נהרות </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">איתן</span><span class="font5">, where the psalmist credits G’d with both&nbsp;drying up rivers, and with providing the driest parts of nature&nbsp;suddenly producing torrents of water. According to Ibn Ezra,&nbsp;איתן means: hard as rock. If we needed proof, perhaps it can&nbsp;be found in verse 6 where the elders suddenly wash their&nbsp;hands in that driest of regions. Where did they take the water&nbsp;from to do so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">אשר לא עבד בה, “which has never been made to work;” there had never been water holes in that vicinity from which it&nbsp;could have been irrigated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ולא יזרע, “it had never been sown;” nor had the adjoining soil ever been sown. We have read about similar pieces of&nbsp;land in Leviticus 16,22, ארץ גזרה, “a land completely cut off,”&nbsp;the final resting place of the scapegoat that carries the sins&nbsp;of the Jewish people on the Day of Atonement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">וערפו, “they shall break the neck;” this symbolises what had been the method by which the slain person had died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">את העגלה, “the heifer;” the entire procedure symbolises that just as the slain person had been deprived of what a&nbsp;human being can accomplish in life, so the animal that takes&nbsp;its place is one that had never been allowed to fulfill its&nbsp;function in life. It had died in a state of virginity and had been&nbsp;consigned to virgin earth that also never fulfilled its function,&nbsp;the reason for its existence, to be the source of nourishment&nbsp;for man. The simile of “virginity,” also applies to the people</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">who perform these rites and who profess to be totally innocent, (virginal) of any guilt in the death of the slain&nbsp;person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונגשו הכהנים, “and the priests will approach;” they&nbsp;as well as all the elders of the town nearest the slain person;&nbsp;the Torah resumes the narrative interrupted in verse 2. The&nbsp;priests are often identified with the judges of Israel, and have&nbsp;been referred to as such in that verse as colleagues of the&nbsp;elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">בני לוי, the Levites, who are not subject to having to have unblemished bodies in order to fulfill their normal&nbsp;functions related to the Temple. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ולברך בשם </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">הי</span><span class="font5">, ”and to pronounce the blessings using the name of The Lord;” we learn from here that the priests may&nbsp;pronounce the priestly blessings even if they have blemished&nbsp;bodies. [Although they may, of course, not perform service&nbsp;on consecrated ground. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ירחצו את ידיהם, “they shall wash their hands;” a&nbsp;symbolic gesture, as if to say: “just as our hands are clean&nbsp;from dirt, so our bodies are free from sin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וענו ואמרו, “and they shall speak and say:” this&nbsp;verse addresses the elders who are taking leave from the&nbsp;ritual;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ידינו לא שפכה את הדם הזה, “our hands have not spilled this blood;” it is unusual for the last letter in the word שפכה to be&nbsp;the letter ה instead of the appropriate letter ו, for the plural&nbsp;ending plural. According to our sages, a host is duty bound to&nbsp;provide his guest with five amenities: food, drink, accompany&nbsp;him a short distance when he leaves, provide with a bed for&nbsp;the night if he wishes to stay for the night, and to give him an&nbsp;ever so minimal gift on his departure. The letter ה would&nbsp;therefore be a veiled reference to that law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You may well ask if the Torah really thought that the priests and elders who lived many kilometers distant from&nbsp;where this murder occurred, had really been suspected of&nbsp;having had a hand in this foul deed; why should they need to&nbsp;have to declare that they were innocent of this crime?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that the declaration by the elders and priests refers to the murdered person not having been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">seen&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">by any of them and having been </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">denied</span><span class="font5"> anything he had&nbsp;asked for. The Rabbis felt also that possibly the murdered&nbsp;person, after having been denied his needs in the last city he&nbsp;visited, turned to the first person whom he encountered who&nbsp;had some food on him and snatched it, as a result of which a&nbsp;fight developed during which he was killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He may even have acted in self-defense, and have become a victim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ועינינו לא ראו, “and our eyes have not seen;” i.e. have not seen this individual while he was alive so that we could have&nbsp;become guilty of not performing our duty toward him. The&nbsp;duty hinted at, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> is to give him safe&nbsp;conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation; there is a saying in the Talmud, according to which when someone extends a loan to&nbsp;a person he has to remain where they parted until the&nbsp;borrower is no longer within his field of vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כפר לעמך ישראל, “forgive Your people Israel!” They&nbsp;ask forgiveness for not having provided adequate security on&nbsp;the streets leading to their town so that this kind of murder&nbsp;could not have occurred and the perpetrator escaping with&nbsp;impunity. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">אשר פדית, “just as You have liberated the people of Israel from Egypt in spite of their shortcomings, exonerate us&nbsp;from any responsibility in the killing of this unknown&nbsp;individual.” Do not burden Your people with the guilt of&nbsp;shedding innocent blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">21.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואתה תבער, “So You shall remove, etc;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">explains here that the reference here is that in the event that&nbsp;the murderer is found after the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eglah arufah,</span><span class="font5"> the heifer that&nbsp;was supposed to atone for the deed, had already been put to&nbsp;death, the people who had killed that beast should not be&nbsp;held responsible for wasting its life, and the murderer will be&nbsp;dealt with judicially. Although </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> says that he will be&nbsp;executed, seeing that there were neither witnesses nor&nbsp;warning how can that be? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> of course quoted the&nbsp;Talmud, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 47 to that effect. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to ask that we have learned in the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ketuvot,</span><span class="font5"> folio 37, that the meaning of the verse in&nbsp;Numbers 35,33: ולארץ לא יכופר לדם אשר שופך בה, “but no&nbsp;expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed&nbsp;therein (of innocent people)”, so why was this verse&nbsp;necessary at all? The answer is in order to give us guidance&nbsp;for the scenario described by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> as quoted in the Talmud&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why do we need the request that G’d should remove the innocent blood? It is to teach that all murderers are&nbsp;basically compared to the paragraph dealing with the heifer&nbsp;discussed in our chapter. Just as that heifer’s death is&nbsp;caused by breaking its neck, the neck of all murderers is&nbsp;broken as part of the execution, [Cutting off his neck with a&nbsp;sword. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, that leaves the problem with the sage who holds that the death penalty for murder is&nbsp;strangulation. That death penalty is rated as harsher than the&nbsp;death penalty by cutting off one’s head with the sword. [The&nbsp;reader must remember that whereas the two death penalties&nbsp;by stoning or burning have been spelled out in the Torah, the&nbsp;other two types of death penalties have not been spelled out.&nbsp;Ed.] If not for the verse in the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ketuvot</span><span class="font5"> folio&nbsp;37, we would have thought that the sin of murder warrants a&nbsp;more severe penalty that cutting off the head. Our author&nbsp;pursues these details; I have decided that they are not of&nbsp;great interest to either a potential victim or an innocent&nbsp;bystander. Ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כי תעשה הישר, “when you will do what is right in the eyes of the Lord.” The word כי in this verse is to be understood as&nbsp;if the Torah had written: אם, ”if.” or “when.” In practice the&nbsp;essential part in carrying out this commandment is the&nbsp;measuring of which is the nearest inhabited location to the&nbsp;site where the body of the slain person was discovered.&nbsp;Without determining this, the whole procedure leading to&nbsp;atonement cannot even commence. As mentioned&nbsp;previously, the “measuring” is far more than a mere&nbsp;technicality. The publicity connected to the taking of these&nbsp;measurements sets in motion a search for the killer.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Ki Teytze</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תצא</span><span class="font5">, “when you go forth;” the introductory&nbsp;words of this paragraph are intended to teach that what&nbsp;follows are rules that apply only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">outside</span><span class="font5"> the boundaries of the&nbsp;Holy Land, and that they are not comparable to those that&nbsp;apply in the Holy land. The paragraphs that we have read&nbsp;prior to this, generally applied to conduct of Israelites in the&nbsp;Land of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי תצא למלחמה</span><span class="font5">, “when you go forth to do battle;” the Torah refers only to what are known in the Talmud as&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">milchemet r’shut,</span><span class="font5"> wars that have been sanctioned by G’d&nbsp;after consultation with Him through the High Priest. The&nbsp;reason that this is clear beyond doubt is that the Torah&nbsp;permits you to take prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושבית שביו</span><span class="font5">, “and you carry away prisoners you have taken.” This includes Canaanites, who might have emigrated&nbsp;from their land during the wars conducted by Joshua. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">אשת</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> יפת תואר</span><span class="font5">, “an attractive looking woman.” The&nbsp;term includes women that are married.” If you were to ask&nbsp;where the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Midrash</span><span class="font5"> making that statement had its source, the&nbsp;fact that the word אשת instead of אשה, is in a construct mode,&nbsp;strongly suggests this. If married prisoners were excluded&nbsp;from the legislation about to follow, the Torah should have&nbsp;written: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">אשה</span><span class="font5"> יפת תואר. If you would query further by quoting&nbsp;the Talmud in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin, Tossaphot folio</span><span class="font5"> 52, that&nbsp;the term “marriage” as understood in Jewish law does not&nbsp;exist among gentiles, the Torah uses the term here only&nbsp;because you might have thought that if this woman had been&nbsp;“married,” i.e. in an exclusive sexual relationship with one&nbsp;partner, she could not be married by a Jewish soldier, at&nbsp;least not unless divorced, the Torah makes clear that this is&nbsp;not so. It is certainly remarkable that the Torah permits a&nbsp;Jewish soldier to marry such a prisoner of war even after she&nbsp;had undergone all the procedures which follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולקחת</span><span class="font5">, “you will marry,” according to the plain meaning of the text this means that you, the captor, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">intend</span><span class="font5"> to marry&nbsp;her as soon as possible. We had been told already in Deut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">20,14, that it is permissible to take women, children and&nbsp;livestock as loot in the expansionary war described in that&nbsp;paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וגלחה את ראשה</span><span class="font5">, “she is to shave off the hair of her&nbsp;head.” This is parallel to the rites observed by a person&nbsp;afflicted with the skin disease known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat</span><span class="font5"> prior to that&nbsp;person regaining a status of ritual purity. (Leviticus 14,9)&nbsp;Even Levites, prior to their appointment to their new status,&nbsp;had to do this, as it is a symbolic way of advancing to a level&nbsp;of holiness from the level of profaneness. (Numbers 8,7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whatever can be removed from that prisoner while she was still a gentile must be removed before she can become a&nbsp;member of a holy nation. Hence both hair and nails have to&nbsp;be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועשתה את צפרניה</span><span class="font5">, “she must pare her nails.” When speaking of paring nails, the Torah does not use the term:&nbsp;“shave,” but uses a term which implies that the result will be&nbsp;an improvement in one’s appearance. We are familiar with a&nbsp;parallel to this from Samuel II 19,25: לא עשה את שפמו ולא עשה&nbsp;את רגליו, “he had not trimmed his mustache or pared his toe&nbsp;nails (as a sign of mourning or distress).” This is how Rabbi&nbsp;Eliezer in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> interprets our verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והסירה את שמלת שביה</span><span class="font5">, “and she is to remove the&nbsp;outer garment she wore when taken prisoner;” this was a&nbsp;garment she wore while worshipping her idols. We have&nbsp;examples in the Bible of such garments having to be&nbsp;scrapped in Genesis 35,2, where Yaakov commands his&nbsp;family members to scrap the captured garments they were&nbsp;wearing, which had originated in the city of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sh’chem.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">Anything that she was able to remove, which was a reminder&nbsp;of when she worshipped idols, had to be removed and&nbsp;destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was no need for the Torah to add that her body too must undergo an immersion in a ritual bath, Such a rule&nbsp;had already been made plain in Numbers 31,19 where the&nbsp;Jewish soldiers returning from the penal expedition against&nbsp;Midian had to undergo bodily purification for seven days as&nbsp;they had been in contact with dead bodies of Midianites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובכתה את אביה ואת אמה</span><span class="font5">, “and she is to observe a period of weeping (mourning) for her father and mother.” Weeping&nbsp;helps a person release feelings that had been suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This will help her get over the loss of her parents. She may have assumed that her parents had died during the fighting.&nbsp;(Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואחר כן תבא אליה</span><span class="font5">, “after all this, her captor may join her and marry her.” He is not allowed to have carnal relations&nbsp;with her before this. It would be in very bad taste to indulge in&nbsp;carnal relations with such a prisoner while she was weeping&nbsp;for her parents, and you were enjoying her body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תתעמר בה</span><span class="font5">, [the Torah now addresses the&nbsp;soldier, Ed] “do not treat her as a slave;” this verb is used for&nbsp;treating merchandise. The Torah warns the husband, or ex&nbsp;husband, of this prisoner of war, not to treat that woman as if&nbsp;she were merely chattel to be sold; (verse 24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תחת אשר </span><span class="font5">עניתה, “seeing that you have already humbled her.” These words still refer to the line: ושלחתה לנפשה, “you&nbsp;shall let her go her own way;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תהיינה לאיש שתי נשים</span><span class="font5">, “If a man has two wives;”&nbsp;this paragraph is appropriate here as we have just read of a&nbsp;union that is unsatisfactory to the husband, although it had&nbsp;commenced with mutual fondness of the parties. (verses 11&nbsp;and 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וילדה לו</span><span class="font5">, “and she gives birth for him;” by any means, even by caesarean section. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את אשר יהיה לו</span><span class="font5">, “whatever he shall own.” From&nbsp;this formulation we learn that a son (not a firstborn) is entitled&nbsp;to inherit also what is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">owed</span><span class="font5"> to his father at the time of his&nbsp;death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על פני בן השנואה</span><span class="font5">, “in preference to the firstborn son of the wife he dislikes;” [if he had literally </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hated</span><span class="font5"> her, he would have&nbsp;had to divorce her. We find that our matriarch Leah also&nbsp;considered herself “hated” by her husband, clearly an&nbsp;exaggeration; otherwise Yaakov would have kicked her out&nbsp;after the wedding night. (Compare Genesis 29,33) Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We find the expression: על פני, meaning “preferable to” also in Exodus 20,3: לא יהיה לך אלוהים אחרים על פני, “you must&nbsp;not have other deities that you prefer to Me.” Compare also:&nbsp;Numbers 3,4: ויכהן אלעזר </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואיתמר </span><span class="font5">על פני אהרן אביהם, “he&nbsp;appointed Eleazar and Ittamar as priests (even) while their&nbsp;father was still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בן השנואה יכיר</span><span class="font5">, “he must recognise the son of the&nbsp;“hated” wife as his firstborn. The reason why the Torah&nbsp;chose the expression “recognise” here is that usually when&nbsp;someone wishes to deny a relative some favour that the&nbsp;latter claims he is entitled to, he behaves as if he does not&nbsp;even ”know” such a person. We find an example of this&nbsp;expression in such a situation when Joseph’s brothers came&nbsp;to Egypt to buy grain and he pretended not to know who they&nbsp;were, i.e. ויתנכר, (Genesis 42,7). The Torah there had told us&nbsp;that he had recognised them immediately. On the other&nbsp;hand, when Boaz treated Ruth, whom he had never even&nbsp;met, with kindness and consideration, (Ruth 2,10) she is so&nbsp;astounded that she asked him what prompted him to treat&nbsp;her as if he had known her for a long time, מדוע מצאתי חן&nbsp;בעיניך, “what caused me to have found favour in your eyes,&nbsp;ואני נכריה, when I am a complete stranger?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah demands of the father of his biological and chronological firstborn to introduce him as such to anyone&nbsp;who does not know him. Moreover, Jewish law decrees that&nbsp;when a father introduces his son in such a way he is&nbsp;trustworthy and does not have to provide independent proof&nbsp;for his claim. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kidushin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 74.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">פי שנים</span><span class="font5">, “a double portion,” (inheritance); I have already explained on Numbers 3,12 why this is so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ימצא לא</span><span class="font5">, “of all that he actually owns and has control over at the time of his death.” (excluding receivables)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לו משפט הבכורה</span><span class="font5">, “the rights of the firstborn are his.” (not a female firstborn.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'כי יהיה לאיש וגו</span><span class="font5">, “if a man has, etc.” the reason&nbsp;why the paragraph dealing with a wayward son is appended&nbsp;here is that if such a son is a firstborn, his rights as such are&nbsp;null and void, and the parent must deliver him to the court in&nbsp;order that he will be executed, i.e. he will inherit </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">nothing</span><span class="font5">, not&nbsp;only no double portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בן סורר ומורה</span><span class="font5">, “a son who is stubborn and rebellious.” We have learned concerning this in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 70, that such a son does not become legally guilty of&nbsp;such treatment by his parents until he has consumed a&nbsp;certain amount of meat and drunk a certain amount of wine,&nbsp;both of which he had stolen from his parents. There is some&nbsp;discussion of what precisely is the amount of meat and wine&nbsp;described there. Either way, it is a relatively insignificant&nbsp;amount. Furthermore, according to the Talmud, this theft&nbsp;must occur while the son in question is between 13 years&nbsp;and three months, but before he has become thirteen and a&nbsp;half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that the law as it stands is not only not cruel, but is designed to preserve the afterlife for such a&nbsp;wayward son, for if, at such a tender age he were allowed to&nbsp;continue in this way, most likely he would become guilty of&nbsp;the kind of crime that would lead to his forfeiting his share in&nbsp;the world to come because he would have killed an innocent&nbsp;person. If you were to ask how it is that we punish someone&nbsp;for a sin </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">never</span><span class="font5"> committed, or punishable merely by a fine,&nbsp;consider the law of the רודף, someone observed chasing a&nbsp;second person with clear intent to murder that person unless&nbsp;stopped in time. Jewish law not only permits, but expects us&nbsp;to kill this potential murderer before he can carry out his evil&nbsp;intention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do not quote me Genesis 21,17 when Yishmael is about to perish from thirst and an angel is dispatched to save&nbsp;him, (against the protestations of other angels who predict&nbsp;the harm his descendants will do to the descendants of&nbsp;Avraham), and where G’d explains that He cannot allow him&nbsp;to die now as now is not guilty. [The comparison is very&nbsp;lopsided when examined closely and with reference to a&nbsp;period when no Torah had as yet been given. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מורה</span><span class="font5">, “rebellious;” compare Genesis 26,35: מורת רוח, “of rebellious spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,22. וכי יהיה באיש חטא משפט מות</span><span class="font5">, “If someone had been guilty of a capital offense, (and had been duly executed);”&nbsp;this was added at this point as the corpse is going to be hung&nbsp;(for a few hours maximum)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על עץ</span><span class="font5">, not a tree that is still rooted in the earth, but on a wooden structure that had once been a tree. All the sinners&nbsp;guilty of death through stoning, including the rebellious son,&nbsp;will be hung afterwards as a deterrent, but must be buried&nbsp;before sunset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Compare Esther 5,14, where the gallows constructed by Haman to hang Mordechai from is called: עץ, “tree.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,23.לא תלין נבלתו על עץ </span><span class="font5">, “you must not allow his corpse to remain hanging from a tree or gallows,” but bury him on&nbsp;the same day. The reason for this is so that people will not&nbsp;confuse this corpse with the one of a blasphemer whose&nbsp;body is to be displayed by hanging, and people might believe&nbsp;that the corpse they are looking at is that of a blasphemer. It&nbsp;would be considered as an insult to a mortal king if too much&nbsp;publicity would be given to someone who had mutinied&nbsp;against him even if he had already been punished for his&nbsp;crime. Similarly, it would be an insult to the immortal King,&nbsp;our Creator, if too much publicity were to be given to&nbsp;someone who had been audacious enough to insult the&nbsp;Creator through blasphemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation for the line: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי קללת אלוקים תלוי</span><span class="font5">, people seeing the corpse of someone who had been&nbsp;executed for violating G’d’s commands would reason that the&nbsp;guilty party had already paid the price for what he had done;&nbsp;why subject him to indignities by displaying his body?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third interpretation for the above line: this line is addressed to the judges; people seeing the face of the&nbsp;corpse hanging, and knowing the judges who decreed the&nbsp;corpse’s execution might curse them for having executed him&nbsp;for a minor crime, or for not looking for a technicality to avoid&nbsp;having to convict that person of a capital crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי קבור תקברנו ביום ההוא</span><span class="font5">, “but you must inter him the day of his execution,” instead of becoming ritually contaminated&nbsp;under the same roof as the sinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.1. לא תראה את אחיך או את שיו נדחים</span><span class="font5">, “do not inactively watch the ox or sheep of your brother which has gone astray”&nbsp;(voluntarily or against its will); this law applies even in war&nbsp;time when you are on the way to the front; what applies to&nbsp;these categories of domestic animals applies to all&nbsp;categories of domestic beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והתעלמתם מהם</span><span class="font5">, “and you blithely ignore them or hide from them;” you must not ignore their plight. The examples&nbsp;chosen by the Torah are animals that are too big for you to&nbsp;be able claim that you overlooked them as their owners hid&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">השב תשיבם לאחיך</span><span class="font5">, “you must make every effort to restore these animals to your brother.” The Torah is so serious about&nbsp;this demand that it repeats it with slightly different wording in&nbsp;the verse immediately following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;או שורו נופלים בדרך</span><span class="font5">, “or his donkey or ox collapsing&nbsp;on the way,” [due to having been overloaded, Ed.] even&nbsp;though the owner is someone who hates you, you must not&nbsp;ignore this, but assist them in helping the animal to get up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא יהיה כלי גבר על אשה</span><span class="font5">, “a woman must not wear&nbsp;men’s clothing;” it is an act of disgrace and sexual&nbsp;provocation;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having taken note of this law, Yael, the Kenite woman who killed Sisera, the general who had commanded the army&nbsp;of the Canaanite King Jabin of Chatzor, did not use weapons&nbsp;used by male soldiers, such as arrows or a sword when&nbsp;doing so, but took a tent pin. (Judges, 4,21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This paragraph has been written immediately after those dealing with women and warfare, in order to remind us&nbsp;that warfare is something reserved for men, not women.&nbsp;When men go out to war they are likely to encounter&nbsp;situations making promiscuity a great temptation. They are&nbsp;therefore warned not to add to such temptation by dressing&nbsp;up as women. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי יקרא קן צפור</span><span class="font5">, “if a bird’s nest happens” (to be&nbsp;along the way you are walking,) the reason why this&nbsp;paragraph has been written here is because it also deals with&nbsp;chance encounters on the way, i.e. בדרך, “on the way,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קן צפור, </span><span class="font5">“a bird’s nest;” whenever the word צפור instead of עוף occurs in the Torah meaning bird, it refers to a ritually&nbsp;pure bird, one that Israelites are allowed to eat if slaughtered&nbsp;in the prescribed fashion. Therefore the legislation following&nbsp;next applies only to this category of birds. (Compare Rabbi&nbsp;Yitzchok in the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin</span><span class="font5"> folio 139)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תקח האם על הבנים</span><span class="font5">, “you must not take the mother bird together with its young ones;” it would be an act of cruel&nbsp;insensitivity, comparable to cooking the kid in the milk of its</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">mother, something the Torah has repeatedly forbidden. (Deut.14,21) as well as the prohibition to slaughter, even as&nbsp;a sacrifice, a mother cow together with its calf on the same&nbsp;day. (Leviticus 22,28) Our author considers the requirement&nbsp;that the fruit of one’s vineyard even after four years may be&nbsp;consumed by the owner only in Jerusalem, as also in a&nbsp;category intended to teach us how not to give in to the urge&nbsp;to indulge in drinking wine, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על הבנים</span><span class="font5">, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the young.” Other examples of the word על being used as meaning “with,” are found in Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">25,31, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על שדה הארץ יחשב, </span><span class="font5">“it will be considered as belonging&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the fields of the land.” Compare also Numbers 28,10, על&nbsp;עולת התמיד, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> the daily burnt offering, or Numbers 19,5: על&nbsp;פרשה ישרוף, “he is to burn it together </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> its excrement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת הבנים תקח לך</span><span class="font5">, “and the young ones you may&nbsp;take for yourself,” in order to eat them. We learn from here&nbsp;that the eggs may be eaten even, though they have been&nbsp;taken from a living bird. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 64,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tossaphot</span><span class="font5"> there)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והארכת ימים</span><span class="font5">, And you will enjoy long life.” The reward will be far greater than if you had ignored G’d’s law and taken&nbsp;mother bird and its young for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והארכת ימים</span><span class="font5">, the reward matches the fulfillment of the commandment. By not killing both mother bird and all its&nbsp;young, thus not making that family extinct, you will yourself&nbsp;be rewarded with additional years of healthy life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תבנה בית חדש</span><span class="font5">, “When you build a new house;” if&nbsp;the Torah had only written this line, how would I have known&nbsp;that the legislation which follows also applies to buying a new&nbsp;house, or receiving it as a gift? The Torah added the word&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בית</span><span class="font5">, i.e. if the house is yours, regardless of how you came by&nbsp;it, you must install these safeguards on your roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועשית, “</span><span class="font5">you must install a parapet for your roof.” If the old roof had collapsed, you must replace it with a new one.&nbsp;This law is introduced here to remind you that after you have&nbsp;completed the conquest of the Holy Land, and have taken&nbsp;over many houses intact from their previous owners, who&nbsp;may not have had such a protective rail or fence on their&nbsp;roof, you must now provide such a parapet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After dealing with one kind of hazard that your property may present to outsiders, the Torah warns against being the&nbsp;cause of other kinds of hazards by writing as a general rule:&nbsp;לא תשים דמים בביתיך, “do not place anything in a position in&nbsp;your house that might cause bloodshed.” This includes&nbsp;ferocious dogs and shaky ladders. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ketuvot&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 41)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תזרע כרמך כלאים</span><span class="font5">, “do not sow your vineyard with&nbsp;more than one kind of seed;” previously, in Leviticus 19,19&nbsp;we had a similar law where we were warned no to sow two&nbsp;seeds in our fields. The reason given is that the seeds might&nbsp;mingle and produce a new species, something that runs&nbsp;counter to the way G’d created the earth, where we were&nbsp;always told the word למינו, “according to its species.” An&nbsp;example of how what is considered harmless can turn into&nbsp;something extremely harmful are the words קדוש, sacred,&nbsp;holy, and קדשה, harlot, the reverse. The Creator knew why&nbsp;He warned us not to temper with nature, as He had created&nbsp;it. The harlot instead of mating with one man, does so&nbsp;indiscriminately, and we know what the results are likely to&nbsp;be. (Compare Deut.23,18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כלאים</span><span class="font5">, different kinds of seeds, that are hard to tell apart, and therefore are apt not to be recognised. In order to&nbsp;give the warning more deterrent power, the penalty for&nbsp;having grown crops based on mixing seed is not only that&nbsp;they are forbidden to be eaten, they are forbidden to make&nbsp;any kind of use of. When the mixing of species is more&nbsp;visible, such as mixing linen and wool, or mating two different&nbsp;species of animals, the penalty is less severe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תחרוש בשור וחמור</span><span class="font5">, “do not plough with an ox&nbsp;and donkey together pulling the plough.” The ox, being an&nbsp;animal that chews the cud is constantly eating, whereas the&nbsp;donkey in the meantime is being overworked. This is an&nbsp;example of inflicting pain on living creatures. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Baaley&nbsp;Tossaphot.)</span><span class="font5"> An alternate interpretation; G’d’s mercy extends&nbsp;not only to human beings but to all of His creatures.&nbsp;Therefore these two categories of beasts being mismatched&nbsp;as one is far stronger than the other, it would be causing the&nbsp;donkey pain to be part of such a team pulling the plough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יחדו</span><span class="font5">, “together;” it is forbidden only when the two animals are tied together to the ploughshare. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri).</span><span class="font5"> Our&nbsp;sages in the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Kama</span><span class="font5"> folio 54, state:&nbsp;what is stated here includes any two animals of different&nbsp;species, but excludes two human beings pulling the plough&nbsp;together, even if one is considerably stronger than the other.&nbsp;The reason why this law is written here is that we previously&nbsp;spoke about sowing, and ploughing is closely related to&nbsp;sowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;צמר ופשתים יחדו</span><span class="font5">, “wool and linen together.” The&nbsp;reason why only these two categories of yarns are forbidden&nbsp;to be mixed is that the two were involved in the first murder,&nbsp;Kayin’s offering to G’d had consisted of leftover flax that he&nbsp;had grown, while Hevel had offered sheep which grow wool.&nbsp;Seeing that these two species had been indirectly&nbsp;responsible for the first disagreement between two human&nbsp;beings ending in the death of one, we are to be forever&nbsp;mindful of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: These two fibers, the ones used in the garments worn by the priests when performing&nbsp;service in the Temple are permitted to be worn in the same&nbsp;garment by the priests on such occasion. This is why the&nbsp;affliction known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat,</span><span class="font5"> does not strike garments&nbsp;consisting of any other fibers. This is a reminder that there is&nbsp;a basic problem involving these fibers, one that is overcome&nbsp;only on holy consecrated ground when used by the priests in&nbsp;their service to G’d. The Torah teaches that the expression&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shatnes,</span><span class="font5"> means a mixture of woolen and flax (linen) fibers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גדילים</span><span class="font5">, “twisted strings;” the expression is a&nbsp;variant for קליעה, “plaited work.” This law appears here as in&nbsp;connection with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzitzit</span><span class="font5">, fringes used in a ritual context that&nbsp;must be attached to four cornered garments, the prohibition&nbsp;for plaiting wool and linen has been waived. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ארבע כנפות</span><span class="font5">, “four corners.;” only four-cornered garments (or more corners) are subject to this commandment, not&nbsp;three-cornered ones. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי יקח איש אשה, </span><span class="font5">“When a man marries a woman,&nbsp;etc.” seeing that the Torah had dealt with man’s basic&nbsp;preoccupations previously, i.e. building a house, planting and&nbsp;harvesting a field, and the rules governing his clothing, it is&nbsp;appropriate to add some aspects of marriage and its&nbsp;restrictions at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובא אליה ושנאה</span><span class="font5">, “and after having had marital relations with her he hates her;” this translation is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">inaccurate</span><span class="font5">: the&nbsp;Torah means that he had hated her already previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,14. ואקרב אליה</span><span class="font5">, “when I wanted to become intimate&nbsp;with her, etc.” an elegant expression for carnal relations.&nbsp;Compare Genesis 20,4: ואבימלך לא 2בב אליה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“and Avimelech&nbsp;had not slept with her.” Or, Isaiah 8,3: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ואקרב</span><span class="font5"> אל הנביאה, “I was&nbsp;intimate with the prophetess.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויסרו אותו</span><span class="font5">, “they will chastise him;” they will&nbsp;administer punitive lashes to his skin for having transgressed&nbsp;the positive commandment that “you shall love your&nbsp;neighbour as if he were yourself.” (Leviticus 19,18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ונתנו לאבי הנערה, “</span><span class="font5">and they (the elders of the&nbsp;town) give to the father of the girl;” all of the elders. The word&nbsp;נער is repeatedly spelled without the letter ה at the end of the&nbsp;word in this paragraph, but here it is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">read</span><span class="font5"> as if spelled with&nbsp;that letter, suggesting that harmony is being restored through&nbsp;the procedure decreed by the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא יוכל לשלחה</span><span class="font5">, “he can never divorce her at his own initiative;” this is in spite of the fact that generally, when&nbsp;husbands claim to have found that their wives had betrayed&nbsp;them they are considered as telling the truth. This type of&nbsp;individual is not believed unless he can corroborate his claim&nbsp;of her lack of virginity when she got married by eye&nbsp;witnesses. He has been proven a liar, therefore in the future&nbsp;his claims must be substantiated if he is to be taken&nbsp;seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: he is being dealt with on the basis of מדה כנגד מדה, “measure for measure,” i.e. tit for tat.&nbsp;He had tried to blacken his wife’s name so that no one would&nbsp;marry her in the future, hence he will not be able to rid&nbsp;himself of her. The Torah decreed the same penalty for&nbsp;someone who had raped (compare verse 29 this chapter).&nbsp;Seeing that he had forced himself upon his partner once, it is&nbsp;likely that sooner or later he will tire of her and try to divorce&nbsp;her. The Torah therefore prevented such a person from&nbsp;doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל ימיו</span><span class="font5">, “all his life.” The Talmud there queries why the Torah used language that implied that he had done such a&nbsp;thing as divorcing her once before, whereas he had actually&nbsp;not done any thing! The answer given by the Talmud is that&nbsp;this is the reason why that person also has not been&nbsp;punished with 39 lashes as he would have been had he&nbsp;violated a negative commandment by performing a forbidden&nbsp;act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22,22. ומתו גם שניהם</span><span class="font5">, “they will both have to die;” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi </span><span class="font5">explains the unusual wording, i.e. not “they will both be&nbsp;executed,” by saying that this includes the descendents of&nbsp;this pair of sinners. We are not to assume that as soon as&nbsp;these people have been convicted, even though not yet&nbsp;executed, any unborn children will not be affected by their&nbsp;deeds, since their parents had already been considered&nbsp;legally dead. What these people had done does not come&nbsp;under the heading of “if the parents sinned why should the&nbsp;children be punished for this? The word גם, “also,” in our&nbsp;verse is the Torah’s hint that this situation is different from&nbsp;other situations in which parents are both guilty of a serious&nbsp;sin violating the laws of chastity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate approach to our verse: the word גם does indeed refer to the descendants of this pair of adulterers.&nbsp;Even if the willing female partner is a minor, she will also be&nbsp;subject to the penalty of having committed adultery. The&nbsp;same is true for an adult married woman who committed&nbsp;adultery with a boy that had not yet reached puberty. This is&nbsp;though even though we had been told in verse 21 that the girl&nbsp;involved-who by being described as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נערה </span><span class="font5">was not yet an adult&nbsp;was alone in being stoned to death, (seeing she shamed her&nbsp;father under whose roof she had indulged in such shameless&nbsp;conduct). Furthermore, we cannot punish the person with&nbsp;whom she lost her virginity as we do not know who he was. If&nbsp;the adulterer (male) was known and there is evidence&nbsp;against both, they will both be subject to death by&nbsp;strangulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of the apparently superfluous word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גם: </span><span class="font5">even if the woman involved in this adultery is&nbsp;pregnant at the time, we do not wait with carrying out the&nbsp;death sentence until her baby is born. According to an&nbsp;interpretation in Ibn </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ezra,</span><span class="font5"> the word גם is a hint that more laws&nbsp;concerning forbidden sexual unions will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וסקלתם אותם באבנים, </span><span class="font5">“you shall stone them (to&nbsp;death) with stones. The Torah decrees a harsher mode of&nbsp;death for the woman who committed an adulteress act while&nbsp;betrothed, seeing that still having been a virgin, and not&nbsp;having tasted the physical gratification of sexual intercourse,&nbsp;she nonetheless shamed her family; this is a sin which&nbsp;reflects on her father and her family in whose house she lost&nbsp;her innocence and therefore reflects on there having been&nbsp;something wrong in her upbringing. Once she has been&nbsp;married and lived in her husband’s home, the family can&nbsp;blame her aberration as connected to her having left her&nbsp;father’s home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">על דבר אשר לא צעקה בעיר</span><span class="font5">, “because she did not loudly protest being violated,” even though in a city where help&nbsp;would have been at hand. Her silence is proof that she did&nbsp;not really object to being violated by the rapist. She had no&nbsp;reason to fear being killed as the rapist would surely have&nbsp;been found and brought to justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואם בשדה וגו, </span><span class="font5">if this rape had taken place on an&nbsp;field, far from civilization and help; you might argue that there&nbsp;is not much difference between rape in this paragraph and&nbsp;that in the previous paragraph, as the fact that the Torah&nbsp;decrees the death penalty for her attacker makes it is clear&nbsp;that witnesses must have been at hand, otherwise how could&nbsp;her attacker have been brought to justice? We have to&nbsp;answer that there is a basic difference between a rape that&nbsp;takes place in an open field, of a woman who walked there&nbsp;without a chaperone, and rape in a city where a woman feels&nbsp;safe in walking the streets alone, unaccompanied. If the&nbsp;victim did not raise her voice in the city when attacked, where&nbsp;the chances are great that her cries will be heard, we must&nbsp;interpret this as tacit consent on her part, hence the more&nbsp;severe type of the death penalty. If that woman was attacked&nbsp;while walking alone in the field, and she had raised her voice&nbsp;and by chance her rape had been observed by witnesses&nbsp;who had heard her cries, and the attacker had been caught&nbsp;then he is brought to justice; he would be brought to justice&nbsp;even if she had not cried out, as we give her credit for having&nbsp;been afraid that if she cried out her attacker would also kill&nbsp;her. She is therefore not considered as having consented to&nbsp;her violation. The Torah does not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">justify</span><span class="font5"> her tacit compliance,&nbsp;but even if she told the witnesses not to interfere, she is not&nbsp;executed, as her compliance is presumed to have been&nbsp;influenced by fear for her life. The Torah </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">even</span><span class="font5"> excuses her&nbsp;behaviour if when the witnesses arrived the rape was in full&nbsp;progress and her libido had been aroused by her attacker.&nbsp;Whenever there exists </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">doubt</span><span class="font5"> about the victim of a rape&nbsp;having consented tacitly, no court will punish her. [Public&nbsp;opinion might. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ימצא איש נער בתולה</span><span class="font5">, “if a man finds a young girl&nbsp;who is a virgin, etc.;” this paragraph is added at this point as&nbsp;other laws concerning virgins preceded it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">22.29</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא יוכל שלחה, </span><span class="font5">“he is not permitted to divorce her;”&nbsp;he cannot do so even if she was blind or lame. (Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ketuvot</span><span class="font5"> folio 39)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23. 1. לא יקח איש את אשת אביו</span><span class="font5">, “a man must not marry a woman who had been the wife of his father;” (even if she had&nbsp;only been raped by his father, and not legally married) This&nbsp;law does not come under the heading of a woman legally&nbsp;married to his father, as the offspring of such a marriage, i.e.&nbsp;the man the Torah speaks about here, would then be a&nbsp;bastard who cannot marry any Jewish woman. If he had&nbsp;done so he would be guilty of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">karet</span><span class="font5"> penalty, and would&nbsp;forfeit his share in the afterlife. Here we speak of a woman&nbsp;who had been raped by his father, and this is why this verse&nbsp;follows the last verse of the last chapter which dealt with&nbsp;rape, when the penalty had been a financial one payable to&nbsp;the girl’s father. According to the opinion of rabbi Akiva, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">karet</span><span class="font5"> penalty is sometimes also applicable to violation of&nbsp;commandments where this had not been spelled out.&nbsp;According to the other sages, our paragraph would have to&nbsp;speak of someone sleeping with his aunt while that aunt was&nbsp;awaiting completion of the process of completing the levirate&nbsp;marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא יגלה כנף אביו</span><span class="font5">, “and neither is he to uncover his father’s robe.” According to the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 49, what is meant here by the word כנף, is a robe which&nbsp;his father was in the habit of revealing, i.e. a woman with&nbsp;whom his father had indulged in extra marital relations. We&nbsp;find this word in a similar context in Ruth 3,9, where the latter&nbsp;requests that Boaz, as her late husband’s redeemer become&nbsp;her partner in a levirate marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'לא יבא פצוע דכה בקהל ה, </span><span class="font5">someone with crushed&nbsp;private parts must not marry a Jewish woman. Seeing that&nbsp;such a person cannot sire children there is no point in his&nbsp;marrying a Jewish girl who will thus be prevented from&nbsp;becoming a mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכרות שפכה</span><span class="font5">, “or maimed genitals;” this refers to a problem involving transmitting semen to the tip of the penis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'לא יבא ממזר בקהל ה</span><span class="font5">, “a bastard must not marry a&nbsp;Jewish woman;” seeing that he is a product of a union&nbsp;punishable by extinction of its seed, what point is there in&nbsp;such a male impregnating a Jewish woman with his seed?&nbsp;The definition of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mamzer</span><span class="font5"> from the root זר, alien, is someone&nbsp;whose mother was out of bounds to the male who had&nbsp;impregnated her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'לא יבא עמוני ומואבי בקהל ה</span><span class="font5">, “male members of the&nbsp;Ammonite or Moabite peoples must not marry Jewish&nbsp;women. This rule has been written here as the results of&nbsp;these marriages are similarly negative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;על דבר אשר לא קדמו אתכם, “</span><span class="font5">the reason why male&nbsp;members of the last named two nations may not marry&nbsp;Jewish women is that their forbears did not offer the&nbsp;Israelites who were coming out of Egypt either water to slake&nbsp;their thirst nor bread to still their hunger. If they had offered to&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">sell</span><span class="font5"> their water or bread, there still would not have been any&nbsp;reason to be grateful to them for this, as they would have&nbsp;done so out of greed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,7. לא תדרוש שלומם וטובתם</span><span class="font5">, “do not seek their peace nor their prosperity.” If you will be engaged in war with them&nbsp;it is a duty for you to destroy their cities and property&nbsp;including any fruit-bearing trees inside their territory. We find&nbsp;this spelled out by the prophet Elisha in Kings II 3,19 when&nbsp;the Israelites were ordered to attack Moav after the latter had&nbsp;ceased paying taxes to the Kingdom of Israel. This treatment&nbsp;of the Moabites is in direct contrast to other expansionary&nbsp;wars when felling fruit bearing trees is strictly forbidden.&nbsp;Neither were the Israelites at the time allowed to offer peace&nbsp;if the Moabites decided that they had no other option.&nbsp;(Compare Deuteronomy 20,10 and 19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תתעב אדומי ומצרי</span><span class="font5">, “do not abhor an Edomite for&nbsp;he is your brother, nor an Egyptian for you were a stranger in&nbsp;his land” [for many years when you were not slaves. Ed.]&nbsp;This verse is written here as the members of these nations&nbsp;could not convert to Judaism until the third generation after&nbsp;the Exodus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;דור שלישי</span><span class="font5">, “the third generation;” at that point the&nbsp;relationship to the original Egyptians, (also generally&nbsp;speaking) is no longer considered as meaningful in the&nbsp;character development of the great-grandson. We know this&nbsp;from Exodus 10,2 where the Torah commands us to&nbsp;familiarise our children and grandchildren with what&nbsp;happened to us in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Does Torah does not expect the third generation to relate to matters so long in the past, long before they were&nbsp;born, seriously? If so why were we commanded throughout&nbsp;our history never to forget what Amalek did to our forefathers&nbsp;100 generations ago? Ed.]. The prophet extends this by one&nbsp;more generation (Yoel 1,3.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תצא מחנה</span><span class="font5">, “when you go forth in camp, etc.;”&nbsp;this verse was written here as the punitive against Midian&nbsp;was mentioned which had been conducted on account of&nbsp;Bileam’s having caused the Israelites to be seduced into&nbsp;sinning and 24000 had died on account of that. There was a&nbsp;reference to this evil prophet in verse 6 of our chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מקרה לילה</span><span class="font5">, “due to nocturnal emission of semen&nbsp;during the night;” the letter מ in the word מקרה here is a prefix&nbsp;not part of the word itself, just as it is in the word משדה in&nbsp;Leviticus 27,16: משדה אחוזתו, “part of his ancestral field.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.14. *ויתד תהיה לך על אזנן</span><span class="font5">, ”you shall have a paddle amongst your weapons;” seeing that with a few exceptions&nbsp;most of the people going out to fight a war are males, and&nbsp;seeing that they had the Holy Ark with them and they were&nbsp;not able to build separating walls, which would have&nbsp;insulated it from exposure to contaminated air by the ritually&nbsp;impure, the people who had nocturnal seminal emissions and&nbsp;should by rights have left the camp, could not do so because&nbsp;of the danger. This is why every one had to dig his own hole&nbsp;to bury his excrement and cover it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מתהלך בקרב מחנך</span><span class="font5">, “Who walks in the midst of your&nbsp;camp;” the reference is to the Holy Ark which Moses had&nbsp;made in order for the people to have such an Ark to take with&nbsp;them when going out to war. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on Deut. 10,1)i</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תסגיר עבד אל אדניו</span><span class="font5">, “do not hand over to his&nbsp;master a slave who had escaped from him.” This verse was&nbsp;inserted here as it was the habit during wartime that many&nbsp;slaves used the confusion reigning to escape from their&nbsp;masters. They chose the land of Israel as a favourite&nbsp;destination, as they knew they would be treated there&nbsp;humanely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;במקום אשר יבחר</span><span class="font5">, “in a place of his choice;” a place&nbsp;where he could find an opportunity to earn a livelihood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תוננו</span><span class="font5">, “do not treat him unfairly.” The Torah bids us to treat him fairly, just as it had bidden us to treat all aliens&nbsp;fairly, escaped slaves or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תהיה קדשה</span><span class="font5">, “there must not be Jewish harlots;”&nbsp;the verse is appended here on account of the previous verse&nbsp;having dealt with escaped gentile slaves, many of whom&nbsp;might have been forced to be harlots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'לא תביא אתנן זונה בית ה</span><span class="font5">, “do not bring the payment&nbsp;received for practicing harlotry to the house of the Lord;” this&nbsp;verse is added here as the Torah just warned us not to&nbsp;tolerate Jewish harlots in our midst. The expression אתנן from&nbsp;the root נתן “to give,” means “gift.” It is an expression used&nbsp;exclusively in connection with payments made to harlots. The&nbsp;letter א at the beginning, which appears extraneous, is similar&nbsp;to the letter א in the word אזרוע in Jeremiah 32,21, instead of&nbsp;זרוע for “arm.” We also find such an apparently superfluous&nbsp;letter א in the word אתמול for “yesterday,” which appears&nbsp;more frequently meaning the same as תמול.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.20. לא השיך לאחיך</span><span class="font5">, “do not charge your brother interest on a loan.” (Brother=fellow Jew) In Leviticus 25,36&nbsp;we read about this subject as applying to the poor even if he&nbsp;is a resident stranger. Here it is addressed only to fellow&nbsp;Jews, but includes wealthy Jews who are short of cash but&nbsp;not short of saleable assets. The reason that this verse&nbsp;appears here is that seeing we have been warned not to&nbsp;treat escaped gentile slaves unfairly, this does not include&nbsp;that we must extend loans to such people without charging&nbsp;interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.21. לנכרי תשיר</span><span class="font5">, “you may charge interest to gentiles.”&nbsp;(According to some authorities this is even a positive&nbsp;commandment. Maimonides and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sefer Hachinuch).</span><span class="font5"> All other&nbsp;nations are called </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">gentiles</span><span class="font5"> when compared to the Israelites.&nbsp;Compare Ovadiah 11: ונכרים באו שעריו גם אתה כאחד מהם, “the&nbsp;gentile nations came to its gates, you were as one of them.”&nbsp;Compare also Judges: 19,12, and Solomon’s prayer in Kings&nbsp;I 8,41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תדור נדר</span><span class="font5">, “When you shall vow a vow, etc.” It is&nbsp;possible that this verse appears here as we read previously&nbsp;(verse 19) about a harlot not being allowed to fulfill a vow she&nbsp;had made to the Lord by using money earned from practicing&nbsp;her trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והיה בך חטא</span><span class="font5">, “and you would wind up having committed a punishable sin instead of a good deed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23,24. מוצא שפתיך תשמור</span><span class="font5">, “that which has come forth from your lips you should observe and do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כאשר נדרת</span><span class="font5">, “as you have vowed, voluntarily.” No&nbsp;one forced you to make such a vow, so that not honouring it,&nbsp;or delay in honouring it is entirely your fault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">23.25. כי תבא בכרם רעך</span><span class="font5">, “when you came into your neighbour’s vineyard, etc.” The reason why this subject is&nbsp;discussed here is to contrast it with your having vowed&nbsp;something. When you make a vow it can only be concerning&nbsp;something that you own; when you enter your neighbour’s&nbsp;private property anything you remove comes under the&nbsp;heading of “taking.” (Ibn Ezra) [Ibn Ezra assumes that you&nbsp;have business in your neighbour’s vineyard, seeing you have&nbsp;been hired to help harvest the grapes. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואכלת ענבים כנפשך, </span><span class="font5">“you may eat as many grapes as you desire;” provided the owner has not specifically forbidden you&nbsp;to do so. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Meiri</span><span class="font5"> )</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sages disagree about the significance of the sequence in which the Torah’s laws have been written, i.e. if&nbsp;the order implies a legal linkage to what preceded it.&nbsp;According to Rabbi Joseph in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">folio 4, this portion is an exception in that even the scholars&nbsp;who hold that elsewhere such a linkage does not exist,&nbsp;concerning such sequences in the Book of Deuteronomy&nbsp;they agree that the order in which these laws have been&nbsp;written are of some legal significance. He quotes as&nbsp;examples all the laws written here including even the order to&nbsp;wipe out the memory of what Amalek did to the Israelites&nbsp;when they had come out of Egypt. (Deut.25,19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24,2. והלכה והיתה לאיש אחר</span><span class="font5">, “and she goes and has become someone else’s wife;” the wording implies that even&nbsp;if she had only become betrothed to another man and had&nbsp;not yet consummated this bond, her former husband must on&nbsp;no account take her back as his wife. The sages derive this&nbsp;from the passive: והיתה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">she has become some other&nbsp;man’s.” If, after having been divorced, this woman had&nbsp;engaged in sexual relationships with another man without&nbsp;having made any kind of commitment to her partner, even if&nbsp;she had been paid as a harlot for such a relationship, her&nbsp;former husband is allowed to remarry her. If that woman had&nbsp;been divorced because she had been guilty of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">adultery</span><span class="font5">, her&nbsp;husband cannot remarry her even if she had not remarried or&nbsp;had not been intimate with any other man. The critical word&nbsp;is the word הוטמאה in verse 4, “she had been defiled.” This&nbsp;means that she had absorbed semen from her partner in sin.&nbsp;The letter מ in that word has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא יעבור עליו</span><span class="font5">, “and no summons to explain himself&nbsp;in the court applies to him;” he fill not be fined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לכל דבר</span><span class="font5">, “concerning serving in the army in any capacity;” the letter ל at the beginning of the word לכל, is&nbsp;superfluous. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נקי יהיה לביתו</span><span class="font5">, this refers to the person discussed already in Deut: 20,6 i.e. someone whose bride was betrothed to him&nbsp;but the last stage in the marriage ceremonies, i.e. the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chuppah,</span><span class="font5"> and the bride receiving her ring and a declaration&nbsp;by her groom that he married her and that the ring was the&nbsp;token of this, had not yet taken place. If he had reported for&nbsp;military duty, he is sent back home with orders to complete&nbsp;the marriage ceremonies. Once these have been completed,&nbsp;he is to devote the whole first year of his marriage to make&nbsp;life pleasant for his bride. We needed several extra words in&nbsp;the Torah to make clear that he is not subject to auxiliary&nbsp;duties not connected with actual service at the front where he&nbsp;would not be exposed to danger. For instance, he might have&nbsp;been required to repair damage to roads, etc., or to help with&nbsp;bringing food and drink to the soldiers serving at the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rules applying to this newly wed are identical to the rules applying to someone who had not yet moved into his&nbsp;new house, or had not yet harvested the first crop from his&nbsp;new vineyard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.6. לא יחבול ריחים</span><span class="font5">, “A creditor is not to take as a pledge for an overdue loan the upper millstone;” although the&nbsp;word: “creditor,” did not appear in this verse it is clear that the&nbsp;creditor is the subject in this legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: The verse addresses itself to the creditor, who normally is not even allowed into the&nbsp;house of the debtor, seeing that such pledges are taken by&nbsp;the court’s messenger in order to preserve the self respect of&nbsp;the debtor. In this instance, the creditor was allowed into the&nbsp;debtor’s house to look for a suitable pledge. The Torah&nbsp;warns him not to take something which is essential for the&nbsp;debtor to earn his livelihood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ריחים</span><span class="font5">, this is one of a number of words (nouns) that always appear in the plural mode; some others are: ,שמים&nbsp;מים, חיים, פנים, מלקחים, מעים. Seeing that the lower millstone is&nbsp;anchored to the ground, only the upper one could serve as a&nbsp;pledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ימצא איש גונב נפש</span><span class="font5">, “when a man is found having&nbsp;kidnapped a person, etc.;” why has this verse been repeated&nbsp;seeing that it has been written already in Exodus 21,16? In&nbsp;Exodus nothing is mentioned about the nationality of the&nbsp;kidnapped person. Here the circumstances are defined more&nbsp;clearly, i.e. from among his brethren, i.e. excluding gentiles&nbsp;and even Edomites, i.e. descendants of Yitzchok who&nbsp;elsewhere were addressed even by Moses as&nbsp;“brother.”(Numbers 20,14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: if we had only heard about the first verse dealing with this subject, I might have thought&nbsp;that even an eight day old baby is included in the legislation,&nbsp;i.e. if such a young baby had been kidnapped. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri,</span><span class="font5"> as&nbsp;elaborated on by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Malbim)</span><span class="font5"> The Torah in our verse therefore&nbsp;adds the word מאחיו, “from among his brethren,” meaning&nbsp;that a baby under 30 days old is not included, as we are not&nbsp;sure yet that he is healthy enough to grow up to be a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מאחיו מבני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “from among his brethren the Children of Israel.” The words: מבני ישראל, are intended to exclude a&nbsp;Jew kidnapping an Edomite. The death penalty does not&nbsp;apply in that case. Where do we find the verse in which&nbsp;kidnapping is forbidden as a crime? See Exodus 20,13 in the&nbsp;Ten Commandments, לא תגנוב, “do not steal!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;השמר בנגע הצרעת</span><span class="font5">, “be most careful with the plague&nbsp;known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tzoraat;”</span><span class="font5"> do not excuse a prominent member of&nbsp;society from submitting to the examinations prescribed for&nbsp;fear of embarrassing him by exiling him from the Jewish&nbsp;community until he has been cured. This is why the Torah&nbsp;reminds us to remember what happened to Miriam who was&nbsp;afflicted with this disease and had to remain outside the&nbsp;camp for seven days during the process of being purified.&nbsp;There was hardly a person amongst the Israelites who was&nbsp;more prominent, being the sister of the people’s leader and&nbsp;its High Priest. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam</span><span class="font5">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.10. כי תשה ברעך</span><span class="font5">, “when you lend your neighbour something;” what follows has also been written before in&nbsp;Exodus 22,24; the reason it has been repeated here is that&nbsp;Moses added the warning to the creditor that when&nbsp;requesting a pledge as security for this loan (which is&nbsp;overdue) he must not enter the home of the debtor; it also&nbsp;teaches that when the debtor is unable to repay the loan in&nbsp;cash and the debtor owns land of different qualities, the&nbsp;creditor may only demand repayment from the lowest grade&nbsp;of soil owned by the debtor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">משאת מאומה</span><span class="font5">, ”any kind of loan;” even the wages owed the debtor as day labourer, or his credit at the store where he&nbsp;buys his groceries. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">משאת</span><span class="font5">, the letter א in this word is not heard when reading the Torah in public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא תבא אל ביתו</span><span class="font5">, “you, the creditor, must not enter his (the debtor’s) house when requesting the pledge or the payment.&nbsp;The reason may be that to preserve the sense of privacy, i.e.&nbsp;chastity of the people dwelling inside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יוציא אליך </span><span class="font5">“the debtor is to bring it to you while&nbsp;you are waiting outside.” From these words we learn that the&nbsp;debtor may bring inferior items as pledge, as unless forced to&nbsp;it is natural for him to tender that which we he has the least&nbsp;need of. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 50)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">העבוט החוצה</span><span class="font5">, “the pledge to the outside.” The pledge does not have to be something portable as suggested by&nbsp;these words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואם איש עני הוא</span><span class="font5">, “and if the debtor is a poor man;”&nbsp;what follows does not only apply to a poor man, but the&nbsp;Torah used this example as it applies mostly to poor people.&nbsp;The temptation of the creditor to collect before the debtor will&nbsp;have nothing left to pledge is natural; therefore the Torah has&nbsp;to restrain his natural urge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולך יהיה צדקה</span><span class="font5">, ”and it shall be accounted as a&nbsp;righteous act for you;” if you restore the pledge to that debtor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If after thirty days of your doing this the debtor still has not paid up, the court will sell it and give the proceeds to the&nbsp;creditor. If it was sold for more than what was owed, the&nbsp;surplus is given back to the debtor. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba&nbsp;Metzia,</span><span class="font5"> folio 110-111).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תעשוק שכיר</span><span class="font5">, “do not oppress a hired hand.”&nbsp;This has also been written already in Leviticus 19,13, but has&nbsp;been repeated here to include the resident stranger.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ביומו תתן שכרו, </span><span class="font5">“you are to pay him his wages on&nbsp;the day that he has worked.” The wages become due as&nbsp;soon as he has completed the required number of hours, if&nbsp;he was hired for the night by sunrise, and if he was hired to&nbsp;perform his work during daylight hours, by sunset. The&nbsp;employer has the rest of the day to pay the wages, as we&nbsp;have learned in the Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> folio 111.&nbsp;This is based on the Torah writing here: ולא תבא עליו השמש כי&nbsp;עני הוא, “(on the same day you are to pay him;) before the&nbsp;sun sets.” We also have another verse spelling out that the&nbsp;night must not pass before the labourer receives his pay for&nbsp;the previous day’s work. (Leviticus 19 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואליו הוא נושא את נפשו</span><span class="font5">, “for he has depended on being paid on time with all his heart.” We find this expression used&nbsp;in the same sense in Psalms 25,1: אליך ה' נפשי אשא, “to You&nbsp;My Lord I hope with all my soul.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובנים לא יומתו על אבות</span><span class="font5">, “and children must not be&nbsp;executed for the sins of the fathers.” The Torah addresses&nbsp;itself to the courts. We have an example of such a dilemma&nbsp;facing a court, in Kings II 14,6. King Amazzia was tempted to&nbsp;execute the children of the assassins of his father, but the&nbsp;Bible compliments him for resisting this temptation by&nbsp;obeying the warning in our verse not to do so. While human&nbsp;courts are not permitted to do this, the Lord, Who knows&nbsp;what is in our minds at all times, is permitted to do so as&nbsp;when He does so, He does so because it is in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">best&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">interest of those who are treated thus. (Compare Exodus&nbsp;20,5) Basically, whenever G’d does so, He had waited for&nbsp;generations for the new generations to become better than&nbsp;their fathers and grandfathers. None of these children and&nbsp;grandchildren would ever have been born if G’d had&nbsp;punished their sinful parents and grandparents, instead of&nbsp;extending His mercy for two more generations. They are&nbsp;therefore being punished for their </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">own</span><span class="font5"> sins, not for the sins of&nbsp;their parents. (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sanhedrin</span><span class="font5"> 27.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא תחבול בגד אלמנה</span><span class="font5">, “and you are not to take (as&nbsp;a pledge for an overdue loan) the garment of a widow.” You&nbsp;may not even take the garment of a wealthy widow as a&nbsp;pledge, even if you give it back to her every morning, seeing&nbsp;it is (generally speaking) the only such garment she can wear&nbsp;and maintain her self respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזכרת כי עבד היית</span><span class="font5">, “you shall remember that you&nbsp;used to be a slave in Egypt.” The Lord liberated you from that&nbsp;sorry state by having mercy on you. You should have learned&nbsp;from this to have mercy on your less fortunate neighbours.&nbsp;Do not ever exploit their misfortune by treating them unfairly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.19. 'לגר, ליתו</span><span class="font5">ם</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, ולאלמנה יהיה, למען יברכך ה</span><span class="font5">, “(these sheaves the owner appears to have forgotten) are rightfully&nbsp;the stranger’s, the orphan’s and the widow’s, in order that the&nbsp;Lord will bless you (also in the future).” You will not be&nbsp;deprived of anything by not going back to pick up what you&nbsp;left behind by mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא תפאר</span><span class="font5">, “do not go over the boughs again,” (to&nbsp;look for something you had not noticed the first time.)&nbsp;(According to Ibn Ezra, we find the word פארות in Ezekiel&nbsp;17,6: where it means “branches pointing upwards” which&nbsp;would eventually bear fruit. [If so, our verse would instruct the&nbsp;owner of the orchard not to harvest every last branch so that&nbsp;in the next year the tree would have difficulty in regenerating&nbsp;itself. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">24.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תבצור כרמך</span><span class="font5">, “when you gather the grapes of&nbsp;your vineyard, etc.;” why did this verse have to be written,&nbsp;seeing that we have a similar verse already in Leviticus&nbsp;19,10? If you were to say that the word אחריך, “after you,” is&nbsp;new here, i.e. that the prohibition applies only to grapes the&nbsp;farmer has left </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">behind</span><span class="font5"> him, this is not so, as we have learned&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peah</span><span class="font5"> 7,4 that these types of grapes known&nbsp;as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ollelot,</span><span class="font5"> prematurely fallen grapes, may not be picked up&nbsp;by the farmer even if they are in front of him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">עוללות, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains that grapes known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ollelot</span><span class="font5"> have no shoulder and are not shaped like drops. [The Talmud&nbsp;goes into greater detail, explaining which kind of grapes the&nbsp;farmer must not keep for himself. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">25.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בן הכות, “deserves to be punished by physical&nbsp;lashes;” the expression is similar to בן מות, “deserving of the&nbsp;death penalty,” the word בן here with the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chirik</span><span class="font5"> under&nbsp;the latter ב, is similar to the one in the name of Joshua, i.e.&nbsp;יהושע ב! נון, “Joshua, son of Nun,” or אגור בן יקה, in Proverbs&nbsp;30,1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">והכהו לפניו, “and he has to strike him in his presence.” The man carrying out the court’s judgment must do so in the&nbsp;presence of the judge who had convicted the sinner.&nbsp;(Compare Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Makkot</span><span class="font5"> folio 22.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">כדי רשעתו, “according to the measure of his wickedness.” This sounds somewhat indefinite, as if the&nbsp;judge could impose different penalties of lashes for different&nbsp;sins. The conclusion of the Talmud is that under no&nbsp;circumstances must the number 39 be exceeded. Possibly,&nbsp;the degree of force used to apply the lashes varies with&nbsp;different sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">25.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ארבעים, “forty;” the number 40 is symbolic of the&nbsp;forty days Moses spent on Mount Sinai when he received the&nbsp;Torah, so that it takes forty lashes to cleanse the sinner of&nbsp;the guilt he had accumulated by having deliberately violated&nbsp;a negative commandment by committing an act which must&nbsp;be interpreted as rebellious. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Tanchuma Bamidbar</span><span class="font5"> section&nbsp;23.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">יכנו, “he will beat him;” on his body, not on the garment or garments he is wearing. The part of the body where these&nbsp;lashes are to be applied is between the shoulders of the&nbsp;sinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">לא יוסיף, “he must not exceed this number;” why was this repeated seeing that we read it already in Deuteronomy&nbsp;4,2, where it appeared as a general rule? According to the&nbsp;Rabbis, it means that whereas the sages do not have the&nbsp;right to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">increase</span><span class="font5"> this mode of punishment, they may impose&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">fewer</span><span class="font5"> lashes, such as when the health of the sinner is fragile,&nbsp;and similar considerations. This is also why the Rabbis&nbsp;divided the areas of the body to which these lashes are to be&nbsp;applied, to shoulder, chest, and the upper back where it joins&nbsp;the shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,4. לא תחסום שור בדשו</span><span class="font5">, “do not muzzle the ox while it is engaged in treading corn.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> claims that this wording is&nbsp;meant to exclude human beings. You may muzzle the mouth&nbsp;of a human being under such circumstances </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you were to argue that seeing that the Torah permitted human labourers engaged in assisting the owner in&nbsp;harvesting his vineyard, the Torah had made it plain that&nbsp;while so engaged the labourer could eat to his heart’s&nbsp;content, (Deut.23,25) the Rabbis stated that if the owner of&nbsp;the vineyard had muzzled his labourer to prevent him from&nbsp;eating any of his grapes, he does not have to compensate&nbsp;him for this financially, it is plain that our verse applies only to&nbsp;animals? [The Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Metzia</span><span class="font5"> folio 91, states&nbsp;that if a farmer had violated this commandment and muzzled&nbsp;his ox while it was threshing, he is assessed a certain&nbsp;amount of monetary fine depending on the size of the animal&nbsp;involved, i.e. more for an ox than for a donkey, since the&nbsp;former eats more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Torah does not excuse a human being from a trespass involving the penalty of 39 lashes, however. Had&nbsp;the Torah not written both the verse in Deut 23,25, and our&nbsp;verse here, I would have thought that the Torah excuses the&nbsp;employer of a human being </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">only</span><span class="font5"> from the penalty of being&nbsp;subjected to lashes, but not from the financial compensation&nbsp;due for being denied his rights. Therefore the Torah wrote&nbsp;both verses to make sure that we understand that only&nbsp;animals are subject to this legislation and the penalty for&nbsp;violating it. The critical words are respectively: כנפשך&nbsp;“according to your heart’s desire,” and: בדשו, “while engaged&nbsp;in threshing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash,i</span><span class="font5"> we must question why the Torah writes: בדשו, ”when he is busy threshing;” surely the rule of&nbsp;not muzzling someone’s mouth applies also </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the ox&nbsp;had started to thresh, otherwise nobody would bother to&nbsp;observe this commandment! Besides, why was the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ox&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">singled out as an example for this commandment, surely it&nbsp;applies to other animals engaged in performing work with&nbsp;food also? The example of the ox was chosen as it is the&nbsp;animal that is used for such tasks more than any other. The&nbsp;law applies, of course, also to other animals that can be used&nbsp;to do threshing, It does not apply to human beings, even if&nbsp;these were used for threshing corn, as this is not a normal&nbsp;occupation for which human beings are used. The word בדשו&nbsp;is chosen as it applies to an activity that is as yet not&nbsp;completed, you may not use the product until other&nbsp;commandments have been fulfilled, such as tithing, setting&nbsp;aside </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">challah.</span><span class="font5"> But it applies to activities </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">preparing</span><span class="font5"> nature’s&nbsp;products to serve man as food, working with dough, etc.&nbsp;These are products that are not yet even “owned” in the full&nbsp;sense of the word by the farmer himself until he has given&nbsp;the appropriate portions to the priests, the Levites, the poor,&nbsp;the orphans and the widows. Anyone engaged in such a&nbsp;process must not be denied partaking of the product while&nbsp;working with it. The exception is: milking cows and making&nbsp;cheese. [no part of those need to be shared with the poor or&nbsp;the priests. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,5. כי ישבו אחים יחדו </span><span class="font5">,“when brothers live together, etc.” the word: “together” here is not to be understood in terms of&nbsp;space but in terms of time, i.e. both are alive at the same&nbsp;time. They </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">share</span><span class="font5"> time on earth. In addition, only brothers&nbsp;who share the same father are referred to in the legislation&nbsp;about to be revealed here. [We are familiar with the basic&nbsp;principle about the levirate marriage from Tamar and the&nbsp;sons of Yehudah in Genesis chapter 38, long before the&nbsp;Torah was given to the Jewish people. Ed.] That there are&nbsp;distinctions between brothers from the father and brothers&nbsp;from the mother, we know from when Joseph’s brothers on&nbsp;their arrival in Egypt described themselves by saying that&nbsp;they were all the sons of one father. (Genesis 42,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומת אחד מהם, </span><span class="font5">“and one of them died;” the letter א, has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patach;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יבמה בא עליה ולקחה</span><span class="font5">, “her husband’s brother shall go into her and take her as a wife;” this is a positive commandment,&nbsp;whereas previously this woman had been out of bounds for&nbsp;him as a possible wife, now she is not only permitted, but it is&nbsp;considered a good deed to marry her. This is the preferable&nbsp;solution to this widow’s problem, although the Torah offers&nbsp;an alternate solution, also. This is indicated by the fact that&nbsp;the widow has not returned to her previous status before she&nbsp;had become married to her deceased husband, i.e. free to&nbsp;marry other men. Our author refers the reader to his&nbsp;commentary on Leviticus 6,9 where he compared the&nbsp;situation to the words .</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מצות תאכל</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויבמה</span><span class="font5">, “and he will perform the ritual of the levirate marriage with her.” This is one of the words which allows for&nbsp;two ways to interpret them. It is similar to Exodus 27,3, לדשנו,&nbsp;and other similar words. The meaning of the expression:&nbsp;ויבמה, therefore is: ”the period of suspended status of&nbsp;potential levirate marriage will come to an end and he will&nbsp;make her his wife” in the full sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועלתה יבמתו השערה</span><span class="font5">, “his deceased brother’s widow&nbsp;will proceed to the gate” (where the elders are in session)&nbsp;she will be walking behind her brother-in-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">השערה</span><span class="font5">, it is a rule that the place where the elders are holding their deliberations is on an elevation relative to the&nbsp;rest of the town’s streets. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">להקי</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לאחיו ש</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בישראל</span><span class="font5">, “he refuses to establish a name for his deceased brother in Israel.” The addition of the word:&nbsp;בישראל “in Israel,” prompted the sages to declare that the&nbsp;levirate marriage legislation does not apply to the families of&nbsp;converts. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span><span class="font5"> Hence the ritual described here would also&nbsp;not be necessary for the widow of such a husband to be free&nbsp;to marry any man of her choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ועמד</span><span class="font5">, “and her brother-in-law is required to stand&nbsp;up;” he is required to do this in order that all the elders&nbsp;present can hear his refusal clearly;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וחלצה נעלו</span><span class="font5">, “she will loosen his shoe;” this shoe&nbsp;must be made from leather, as we know from Ezekiel 16,10:&nbsp;ואנעלך תחש, “and I shod you in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tachash</span><span class="font5"> leather. [The skins of&nbsp;the animal from which this leather was made was used as&nbsp;the upper layer of the coverings of the Tabernacle, Exodus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">26,14. Ed] This procedure has to be performed on the right&nbsp;foot of the brother-in-law, seeing that whenever the word רגל,&nbsp;foot or leg, is used without any other adjective, the right foot&nbsp;is meant. (Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> folio 104)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחלצה נעלו</span><span class="font5">, according to the plain meaning of the text this procedure enables her to become the heir of her&nbsp;deceased husband, as her brother-in-law who would&nbsp;normally inherit his estate had refused to “inherit” the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">whole&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">estate, i.e. his widow also. The best known example in the&nbsp;Bible of the procedure is the story of Ruth and Boaz, in Ruth&nbsp;chapter 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In answer to the heretics criticising this procedure as demeaning for women, this procedure may be understood as&nbsp;follows: “if you wish to perform your duty to marry me, I will&nbsp;serve you like a maid serves her master.” When he replies&nbsp;that he is not willing to do so, she will spit out in front of him&nbsp;to signal that she thinks his refusal by rejecting her is&nbsp;disgusting. She hints by her action that as of now she&nbsp;considers him as not worth any more than the spittle she has&nbsp;ejected from her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וענתה ואמרה</span><span class="font5">, she will reply and say: she does this in order 1) to shame her brother-in-law, and b) to put her mind&nbsp;at rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשת האחד</span><span class="font5">, “the wife of the one,” (of the two men fighting one another) as opposed to the wife of the messenger from&nbsp;the court. (According to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri,</span><span class="font5"> the altercation may have&nbsp;been the result of one of the men having been convicted of&nbsp;receiving 39 lashes, and the wife attacks the messenger from&nbsp;the court who was supposed to carry out the sentence.) The&nbsp;text wants to make plain that this is not the scenario here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והחזיקה במבושיו</span><span class="font5">, “and she takes hold of his private parts;” seeing that the Torah singles out the man’s private parts I&nbsp;might have thought that the woman will be punished only for&nbsp;the fact that she chose to attack those parts; in order to show&nbsp;that this was only one example, but the same applies to other&nbsp;parts of the body, the word והחזיקה, “she takes a firm hold,”&nbsp;has been added.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,12.וקצותה את כפה</span><span class="font5">, “you shall cut off her hand;” this penalty excludes the woman who had attacked the&nbsp;messenger of the court sent to beat up her husband. If she&nbsp;defends her husband by attacking the messenger even by&nbsp;attacking his private parts she will not be convicted. (Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Baba Kamma</span><span class="font5"> folio 28) [After looking up the folio&nbsp;quoted in the Talmud, I have come to the conclusion that the&nbsp;point that the Talmud is making there is that if an authorised&nbsp;messenger from the court is attacked and forced to defend&nbsp;himself, he will not be held culpable even if he had attacked&nbsp;the other party by hurting his private parts when he had no&nbsp;other option. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,13. גדולה וקטנה</span><span class="font5">, “large or small.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments here that the Torah speaks of two stones used as weights,&nbsp;both having the same markings. The deception practiced by&nbsp;this is that when </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">selling,</span><span class="font5"> the merchant uses the smaller stone&nbsp;when weighing the goods for his customer, whereas when he&nbsp;is </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">buying</span><span class="font5"> he is using the larger stone when weighing what is&nbsp;due to him. When the Torah writes that we are not to have&nbsp;two weights, the meaning is that when these two stones we&nbsp;mentioned when both put on one side of the scale show the&nbsp;true weight; one being smaller and the other one being larger&nbsp;hides the deception when they are each used independently.&nbsp;This is what he meant when </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> wrote that “the larger&nbsp;stone contradicts the smaller stone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">בכיסך, not literally in your pocket, but in the place where weights are normally kept. (IbnEzra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,18. ויזנב בך</span><span class="font5">, “and attacked the hindmost of you.”&nbsp;Amalek chased after the Jewish people until he caught up&nbsp;with the slowest moving ones. (Ibn Ezra) [The people had not&nbsp;yet been organised into army groups, etc., as we learned in&nbsp;the Book of Numbers. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הנחשלים</span><span class="font5">, as if spelled הנחלשים, “the weakest of them.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואתה עיף ויגע</span><span class="font5">, “while you were tired and worn out.” There&nbsp;is no reason for your being surprised at his taken advantage&nbsp;of you at that time, as he exploited the fact that you were&nbsp;worn out from long marches. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mechilta)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of the words: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא ירא אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, “he displayed no fear of G’d,” these words are addressed by&nbsp;Moses to the Jewish people; he tells them that if they at the&nbsp;time had observed the commandments that they already&nbsp;knew about, Amalek could not have done them any harm&nbsp;and could not even have caught up with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">25,15. </span><span class="font5">!תמחה</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“blot out!” do so before Amalek can attack&nbsp;the Temple. When the Torah, in Exodus 17,14 had written&nbsp;that G’d had said that He would blot out Amalek, it referred to&nbsp;the period </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">after</span><span class="font5"> Amalek had successfully attacked the&nbsp;Temple. (early version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tanchuma)</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Ki Tavo</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והיה כי תבא אל הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “it will be when you come to&nbsp;the Land, etc.” seeing that Moses had told the people in&nbsp;Deut. 25,19 that the commandment to wipe out Amalek&nbsp;would apply only after </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem</span><span class="font5"> had given the people rest&nbsp;from all their enemies, he has to tell them here that what&nbsp;follows applies as soon as they enter and make their homes&nbsp;in the Holy Land. Some notable commandments that become&nbsp;due as soon as they will reap harvests in that land, are: the&nbsp;bringing to the Temple of the first ripened fruit of the seven&nbsp;species for which the land is famous, tithing the grain harvest&nbsp;by giving the Levites their share, inscribing the text of the&nbsp;Torah in the stones of the Jordan river, building the altar, as&nbsp;well as reciting the blessings and curses detailed in chapter&nbsp;27,12-26 on the two mountains designates for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.2</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולקחת מראשית פרי האדמה</span><span class="font5">, “you shall take of the first&nbsp;of all the fruit of the ground;” the reason why the Torah&nbsp;repeats this commandment which had appeared already in&nbsp;Exodus 23,19, is to list the commandments in a certain order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מראשית</span><span class="font5">, from the first,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> emphasises the importance of the letter מ i.e. “from,” as opposed to “all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not even necessary to bring the entire fruit only part of it. [My version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> does not have this, but states that&nbsp;the farmer may designate the respective fruit before it has&nbsp;fully ripened. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מראשית </span><span class="font5">does not describe a time but describes quality, i.e. the best of these&nbsp;first fruit is to be brought to the Temple. The word ראשית&nbsp;appears in this sense of quality also in Jeremiah 2,3 ראשית&nbsp;תבואתו, “the best of His harvest;” [G’d comparing other&nbsp;nations to Israel whom He had chosen. Ed] The prophet&nbsp;Amos in Amos 6,6 also uses the word ראשית in that sense&nbsp;when he said: וראשית שמנים ימשחו, “and they anoint&nbsp;themselves with the choicest oils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another interpretation: the word מראשית means from the first in their respective category that have ripened, the&nbsp;very fact that they ripened earlier making those fruit superior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כל פרי האדמה</span><span class="font5">, “you are to bring these specimens in their original state,” i. e. when whole, not the wine you made out of&nbsp;the grapes, or the oil out of the olives, for instance. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמת בטנא</span><span class="font5">, ”and you shall put it in a basket;” it should be presented in a dignified manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והלכת אל המקום</span><span class="font5">, “and you will go to the place, etc.;” the owner of the first ripened fruit is to do all this himself, not&nbsp;through someone whom he designated in his place. This&nbsp;refers both to collecting the fruit from the tree or cutting it&nbsp;from the ground. When a King employs a servant to tend to&nbsp;his fields, he also expects that tenant to bring him his share&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">personally,</span><span class="font5"> not to delegate someone else with performing&nbsp;that duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.3. אשר יהיה בימים ההם, </span><span class="font5">“who will be on duty during those days; he is not to wait until a relative of his who&nbsp;happens to be a priest is on duty and to give it to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הגדתי היום</span><span class="font5">, “I profess this day, etc.;” I give thanks today for having been privileged to come to this country [or to have&nbsp;been born in it] the land that Lord your G’d had sworn to your&nbsp;forefathers to become ours. He has kept His promise, and I&nbsp;have received my share of it. Now it is my turn to tender a gift&nbsp;from its produce in order to demonstrate that it is He Who&nbsp;has given it to our people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.4. ולקח הכהן הטנא מידך</span><span class="font5">, “the priest will accept the basket from your hands;” the priest acts as the delegate of&nbsp;the king, i.e. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> in this instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והניחו לפני מזבח ה' אלוקיך</span><span class="font5">, “he will deposit it in front of the altar of the Lord your G’d.” If there is no altar, i.e. if the&nbsp;Temple is not standing, this procedure is not valid. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ארמי אובד אבי</span><span class="font5">, “my forefather used to be a&nbsp;wandering Aramean;” this verse has been abbreviated. In&nbsp;full, it should have read: “Yaakov my forefather was a&nbsp;wandering Aramean.” While he was serving Lavan in Aram&nbsp;he was no better than a wandering Aramean, he had no&nbsp;house or land of his own; he was not even a resident in that&nbsp;country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אובד</span><span class="font5">, “poor,” compare Proverbs 31,6, תנו שכר לאובד, “give liquor to the one who is perishing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not astounding to find Yaakov referred to as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Arami, </span><span class="font5">as in Chronicles I 2,17 (יתר(ו is called Ishmaelite, although in&nbsp;Samuel II 17,24, he is clearly called Israelite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובמורא גדול</span><span class="font5">, “and with awesome power,” compare&nbsp;Deuteronomy 7,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ארץ זבת חלב ודבש</span><span class="font5">, “a land flowing with milk and&nbsp;honey.” Just as the land flowing with milk and honey refers to&nbsp;only five of the seven Canaanite tribes where it is first&nbsp;mentioned in Exodus 13,5 so here too Moses refers to the&nbsp;areas of these five tribes. This is also the source of the&nbsp;statement of Rabbi Yossi ha’glili who ruled that firstling fruit&nbsp;could not be brought from produce grown on the east Bank&nbsp;of the Jordan as the quality of the soil there did not lend itself&nbsp;to producing superior fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,10 והנחתו והשתחוית</span><span class="font5">, “and you shall set it down and worship the Lord your G’d;” the verse teaches that these fruit&nbsp;have to be deposited twice. Once at the time the recitation is&nbsp;read, and once when the donor prostrated himself in prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והשתחוית</span><span class="font5">, “you will bow down,” as people do when taking leave of a superior such as a Rabbi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי תכלה לעשר</span><span class="font5">, “when you complete tithing, etc.”&nbsp;this verse is also a repetition of Deut. 14,28; it is inserted&nbsp;here only on account of the confession as per verse 13: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בערתי&nbsp;הקודש מן הבית, </span><span class="font5">“I have removed everything that is holy&nbsp;(second tithe) from the house;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ונתתי ללוי לגר וליתום ולאלמנה</span><span class="font5">, “and I have also given to the Levite, the stranger the orphan and the widow.” This is not&nbsp;necessarily to be understood as cumulative, but you have&nbsp;given to any of the above-mentioned categories of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בערתי הקודש</span><span class="font5">, this is a reference to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bikkurim</span><span class="font5"> as&nbsp;these have to be brought to the Temple. Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mishnah&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bikkurim</span><span class="font5"> 2,2: tithing and firstling fruit rules have&nbsp;something in common with one another which they do not&nbsp;share with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">T’rumah</span><span class="font5"> (2% of the grain harvest given to the&nbsp;priest as the first type of tithe) in that they require to be&nbsp;brought to Jerusalem, and that failing this they have to be&nbsp;destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא אכלתי באוני ממנו</span><span class="font5">, “I have not eaten from it when&nbsp;it was stolen property;” the expression און occurs in this&nbsp;sense in Job 20,10: ידיו תשבנה אונו, “his own hands must&nbsp;restore his wealth” (the illegally acquired wealth).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא בערתי ממנו, “</span><span class="font5">neither I have destroyed any of it unlawfully;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בטמא, </span><span class="font5">“nor have I eaten any of it while in a state of ritual impurity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא נתתי ממנו למת</span><span class="font5">, “nor have I given any of it for the dead;” (a euphemism for given it to idols, i.e. “dead deities.”)&nbsp;I have given all of it to the living G’d, the King of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עשיתי ככל אשר צויתני, “</span><span class="font5">I have acted in accordance with all that You have commanded me.” (regarding the tithes etc., of&nbsp;all that my fields produced)”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואת האדמה</span><span class="font5">, “and the soil,” in order that You will&nbsp;provide the rain at the appropriate time so that I can continue&nbsp;to serve You with the same fervor next year, and fulfill all the&nbsp;commandments connected with ownership of this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את החוקים האלה</span><span class="font5">, “these statutes.” The ones&nbsp;pertaining to the tithes and the firstlings of the fruit,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואת המשפטים, </span><span class="font5">“and the details surrounding these laws,” a reference to the details connected with the laws of tithing,&nbsp;such as not eating from these when in a state of mourning.&nbsp;(verse 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמרת</span><span class="font5">, “you shall observe,” in your heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועשית אותם, </span><span class="font5">“and perform them, in the Holy Land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26.17. את ה׳ האמרת היום</span><span class="font5">, “you have avouched the Lord&nbsp;this day;” you have singled out the Lord today; by accepting&nbsp;G’d’s commandments you, Israel, have adopted the Lord&nbsp;your G’d as your only deity. He has reciprocated by making&nbsp;you His special people, as He demonstrated by all the&nbsp;miracles He performed for your sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">האמרת</span><span class="font5">, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam,</span><span class="font5"> “you have become as if betrothed;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: you traded, exchanged; you have abandoned all other powers in nature by accepting Me&nbsp;as comprising all those forces combined. (seeing that I&nbsp;created all these forces.) He, in turn, has abandoned all&nbsp;attempts to directly educate the other nations by&nbsp;concentrating on you as His pilot project. [Some of these&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">words</span><span class="font5"> are mine Ed.] [In order to understand this&nbsp;interpretation, the letter א in the words האמרת and האמירך have&nbsp;to be considered as non existent, something similar being the&nbsp;case in Jeremiah 32,21: ובאזרוע as well as in Kings II 4,2:&nbsp;דאסוך, and in Psalms 90,4: אתמול.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation: the word האמירך is an expression of admiration, praise, as in Psalms 94,4: יתאמת,&nbsp;”will they indulge in self-glorification? [The psalmist speaks of&nbsp;the wicked. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">26,19. ולתתן* עליון</span><span class="font5">, “and to place you supreme;” where is&nbsp;the source for G’d doing this? Compare Deut. 28,13: 'ונתנך ה&nbsp;לראש ולא לזנב, “and the Lord will make you the head and not&nbsp;the tail.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,2. והקמות לך אבנים</span><span class="font5">, “you shall set up for yourselves stones;” according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> the Torah decrees three times&nbsp;that such stones shall be set up; once in the river Jordan,&nbsp;once in Gilgal, the first stop of the Israelites after crossing&nbsp;that river; and the third time at the base of Mount Eyval. He&nbsp;bases himself on the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 35.&nbsp;[Actually, according to the Talmud there, one set of stones&nbsp;was erected in the land of Moav, another in the Jordan river&nbsp;by Joshua, and the third was erected by Joshua at Gilgal.&nbsp;The Talmud has two versions about this subject, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">apparently having preferred the other version. There is much&nbsp;discussion about this subject; seeing that we cannot resolve&nbsp;what the sages did not resolve who were chronologically&nbsp;much closer to the event, there is no sense in our pursuing&nbsp;the subject further, as it is of no consequence even after&nbsp;Moshiach will have come. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אבנים גדולות</span><span class="font5">, “large stones;” large enough to engrave the list of the commandments in the Torah as listed in the&nbsp;volume </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">halachot gedolot.</span><span class="font5"> (negative commandments) These&nbsp;stones were to be placed on one another and separated by&nbsp;some kind of mortar, just as in any normal building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,4. תקימו את האבנים האלה</span><span class="font5">, “you shall set up these stones.” This verse refers to the stones mentioned in verse&nbsp;two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בהר עיבל, </span><span class="font5">“at Mount Eyval.” In order to pacify the tribes that had been ordered to stand on Mount Eyval while&nbsp;listening to the curses, Moses ordered the building of an altar&nbsp;of stones to be built there on which burnt offerings were to be&nbsp;offered [This is the only time we hear about burnt offerings&nbsp;being offered other than on the altar at the entrance to the&nbsp;Tabernacle, inside its compound for the last 39 years. Ed.]&nbsp;Also peace offerings were to be offered there, i.e. offerings&nbsp;that in the main were eaten by the people at large, not the&nbsp;priests and their households. This would convince the tribes&nbsp;lined up there that the presence of the Lord was as much in&nbsp;evidence there as above the Tabernacle itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,5-7. לא תניף עליהם ברזל</span><span class="font5">, “you shall not lift up any iron tool over these stones in connection with building this altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אבנים שלמות תבנה</span><span class="font5">, “you are to use whole stones for building it.” (unhewn) Our sages in the Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Middot,</span><span class="font5"> folio 3, derive from this verse that if any of these&nbsp;stones had been touched by iron the altar is disqualified from&nbsp;being used. Moreover any blemish on any of the stones used&nbsp;in building it, similarly disqualifies an altar from being used.&nbsp;Having heard the commandment not to use iron, where did&nbsp;we learn about the penalty if these instructions would be&nbsp;disregarded? It is found in Exodus 20,22: כי חרבך הנפת עליה&nbsp;ותחללה, “for if you have lifted an iron tool over it you have&nbsp;desecrated it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,9. היום הזה נהיית לעם</span><span class="font5">, “on this day you have become a nation;” this is the result of having accepted the laws of the&nbsp;Torah with a solemn oath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,12</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אלה יעמדו</span><span class="font5">, “the following are to stand, etc.;” all the&nbsp;tribes that stood on the mountain listening to the blessings&nbsp;were descended from Yaakov’s principal wives Leah and&nbsp;Rachel. Seeing that Leah had so many sons, they took the&nbsp;oldest and the youngest of these and placed them with the&nbsp;four tribes that were descended from the auxiliary wives.&nbsp;Leah’s oldest son who had been under suspicion of having&nbsp;committed an inappropriate act with one of Yaakov’s auxiliary&nbsp;wives was placed there so that the curse on people sleeping&nbsp;with their neighbour’s, or their father’s wives would be&nbsp;impressed on the descendants of his who heard it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that the descendants of Reuven all stood there was to be proof that the original Reuven could not have been&nbsp;guilty of transgressing these commandments, else he would&nbsp;have been subject to his father’s curse, something that&nbsp;clearly was not the case. The youngest one of the sons of&nbsp;Leah was Zevulun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,12.לברך את העם</span><span class="font5">, “to bless the people;” the following tribes are to stand on Mount Gerizim, etc.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> -following&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Mishnah</span><span class="font5"> tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah,</span><span class="font5"> folio </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">32,</span><span class="font5"> comments that six tribes&nbsp;ascended Mount Gerizim, and 6 tribes ascended Mount&nbsp;Eyval, the priests and that the Levites were standing at the&nbsp;respective bases of these two mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, the opinion of Rabbi there, is that both the twelve tribes and the Levites stood at the base of&nbsp;the mountains as described in the Book of Joshua, the latter&nbsp;standing next to the Holy Ark. (Joshua 8,33) According to&nbsp;Rabbi, what has been described in Deuteronomy 11,29&nbsp;means that the other tribes stood near each of those two&nbsp;mountains. The word על mentioned there, means the same&nbsp;as in Exodus 40, 3: וסכות על הארון, “you will screen the Ark&nbsp;with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Eliezer, son of Yaakov, in tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> 37, claims that it is impossible that the members of the tribe&nbsp;stood at the base of these mountains as they had already&nbsp;been included as one of the tribes that stood on the mountain&nbsp;in our verse here, [which was written long before the one in&nbsp;Joshua 8,33. Ed.] At the same time, the verse in Joshua 8,33&nbsp;clearly appears to contradict this. How are we to resolve this&nbsp;apparent contradiction? According to Rabbi Yoshiah, the&nbsp;Levites who were potentially fit to carry the Holy Ark, i.e. the&nbsp;ones 30 years and older but below the age of 50, stood at&nbsp;the base of the mountain, next to the Holy Ark, whereas the&nbsp;other Levites stood on Mount Gerizim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> further comments on our verse here, that the Levites standing at the base faced the six tribes standing on&nbsp;top of Mount Gerizim commenced </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">blessing</span><span class="font5"> the six tribes,&nbsp;using the text written for the curses but inverting it by saying&nbsp;that all the people not guilty of the sins described in our&nbsp;chapter are blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,15. ושם בסתר. </span><span class="font5">“and he set it up in secret;” all the&nbsp;transgressions mentioned in this chapter deal with sins&nbsp;usually committed in the privacy of one’s house, and&nbsp;therefore it is impossible to find witnesses who had warned&nbsp;the perpetrator in a legally acceptable manner. To quote just&nbsp;one example: “who would know if someone had cursed his&nbsp;father or mother?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,17. מסיג גבול</span><span class="font5">, “who removes his neighbour’s landmark.” The perpetrator certainly would not do such a&nbsp;thing in broad daylight. Similarly, he would not deliberately&nbsp;make a blind person go astray where there were witnesses&nbsp;observing this. He knows that the blind person himself&nbsp;cannot identify him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,19. גר, יתום, ואלמנה</span><span class="font5">, “a stranger, orphan, or widow;” all these categories of people lack influential friends or&nbsp;protectors who will protest their having been maltreated to&nbsp;the authorities. People who have carnal relations with their&nbsp;closest relatives who live in the same house with them are&nbsp;not suspected of having been guilty of such behaviour,&nbsp;neither are people normally suspected of having sexual&nbsp;relations with their domestic animals. The only two sins listed&nbsp;here which are committed openly are idolatry and violent&nbsp;behaviour against one’s neighbour committed usually while&nbsp;angry and out of control. This is why the Torah adds the word&nbsp;“committed secretly,” when speaking of these two sins. When&nbsp;these two sins are committed openly there is a court which&nbsp;can take action against the perpetrator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,24. </span><span class="font5">On this verse </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> comments that there are&nbsp;eleven sins which have been introduced here with the word:&nbsp;“cursed be.” They correspond to eleven tribes. No such&nbsp;“curse” is written concerning the tribe of Shimon, as Moses&nbsp;did not have in mind to give this tribe a blessing, Zimri, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">its&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">leader, having announced </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">publicly</span><span class="font5"> that Moses had violated&nbsp;this law by marrying a Midianite woman, thus making him&nbsp;and the whole tribe guilty of “bad-mouthing” Moses. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">court had ample evidence of convicting him of that sin. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary, the last of the list,&nbsp;referring to people who do not uphold Torah law, would refer&nbsp;to people guilty of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lashon hara,</span><span class="font5"> i.e. badmouthing others.&nbsp;There is no one who is not guilty of this at one time or&nbsp;another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are scholars who claim that there are twelve sins to which the introductory word: “cursed be” applies, so that&nbsp;Moses did not make an exception concerning the tribe of&nbsp;Shimon. The </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">word:</span><span class="font5"> “cursed be,” therefore had to be used&nbsp;only eleven times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">27,26. אשר לא יקים</span><span class="font5">, “who does not accept;” this expression is used in the same sense in Deut. 29,12: למען&nbsp;הקים אותך היום לעם, “in order to accept you this day as a&nbsp;nation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,2. ובאו עליך כל הברכות האלה, </span><span class="font5">“and all these blessings will come upon you;” you will not have to strive to secure&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,3. ברוך אתה בעיר</span><span class="font5">, “you will be blessed in the city;” all kinds of merchandise will be available there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of this phrase: you will be able to bring your harvests from the field safely into your&nbsp;barns in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בשדה</span><span class="font5">, “in the field;” both at the time of seeding and of planting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,6. ברוך אתה בבואך...ובצאתך</span><span class="font5">, ”you will be blessed when you are coming in ...and when you are going out.” This refers&nbsp;to coming home from war and going out to do battle. The&nbsp;expressions </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בא </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">צאת, </span><span class="font5">are used in this sense in Numbers&nbsp;27,17: אשר יצא לפניהם ואשר יבא לפניהם , “who will go out in front&nbsp;of you when going to war and before you when returning&nbsp;from battle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יקימך</span><span class="font5">, same as יעמידך, “He will establish you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וראו כל עמי הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “and all the peoples of the earth&nbsp;will see, etc.” concerning Israel it had been said in Yoel 3,5:&nbsp;כל אשר יקרא בשם ה׳ ימלט; “but everyone who will invoke the&nbsp;name of the Lord will be saved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי שם ה׳ נקרא עליך</span><span class="font5">, “that the name of the Lord is proclaimed over you.” When G’d has blessed you visibly to&nbsp;all the nations, you are perceived as being the favorite of the&nbsp;G’d of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וראו</span><span class="font5">, “they will understand” (i.e. see with their mind’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">eye)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Compare Ecclesiastes 1,16: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ולבי</span><span class="font5"> ראה הרבה חכמה ודעת, “and my mind </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">has absorbed</span><span class="font5"> much wisdom and learning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,12. והלוית גוים רבים</span><span class="font5">, “and you will lend to many nations;” to nations who were plagued with crop failures or&nbsp;storage problems in their barns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,16. ארור</span><span class="font5">, just as the meaning of ברוך commonly&nbsp;translated as “blessed,” means enjoying the abundance of&nbsp;success and good things, so the word ארור, its opposite,&nbsp;means loss of valuable things and dearth of many essential&nbsp;things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,20. ואת המגערת</span><span class="font5">, “curse;” the root of the word is גער to&nbsp;be angry;” G’d will express His anger by letting your crops&nbsp;fail. Proof that this is the correct interpretation of the word&nbsp;מגערת, can be found in Maleachi 2,3: הנני גוער לכם את הזרע, “I&nbsp;will put your seed under a curse;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובחרב</span><span class="font5">, “and with fiery heat;” here the word חרב is&nbsp;not used in the literal sense meaning “sword,” but as&nbsp;something derived from חורב and יובש, “dried out by&nbsp;excessive heart of the sun.” (Compare Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.23.</span><span class="font5"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;נחושת, “copper;” not literally turning the sky into&nbsp;copper, but delivering moisture only like copper when its&nbsp;“sweats.” The same euphemism is used also for the word&nbsp;ברזל, “iron,” describing the earth beneath. In the commentary&nbsp;by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Torat Kohanim,</span><span class="font5"> these euphemisms are understood in the&nbsp;reverse sense, i.e. the earth being like copper and the sky&nbsp;like iron. This is the way it had been described in Leviticus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">27,19, where the chastisement has been authored by G’d&nbsp;Himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,24. אבק ועפר</span><span class="font5">, “powder and dust;” the strong winds&nbsp;which normally bring rain from the sky, will instead be&nbsp;sandstorms originating in the tops of the mountains so strong&nbsp;that they turn the trees’ roots upside down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אבק ועפר</span><span class="font5">, the letter א has the vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz</span><span class="font5"> under it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואין מחריד</span><span class="font5">, “and there is no one to frighten them&nbsp;away.” No one will bother to bury these carcasses as the&nbsp;survivors have so many other problems to deal with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: no one will chase the vultures away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ובטחורים</span><span class="font5">, and incurable hemorrhoids. Seeing that&nbsp;these ailments originate in hidden regions of the body they&nbsp;cannot be treated medically, and are described in the written&nbsp;text as עפולין, “from a dark place.” Since these ailments have&nbsp;been inflicted by G’d and are not phenomena known in&nbsp;nature, it is evident that physicians cannot deal with this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כאשר ימשש העור באפלה</span><span class="font5">, “as the blind gropes in the&nbsp;darkness.” He does so out of fear. If he felt that he was in an&nbsp;area that was lit up, there would be people who would assist&nbsp;him, or at least warn him of obstacles in his way. (Talmud&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah,24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשה תארש; </span><span class="font5">”you shall betroth a woman to&nbsp;become your wife, seeing that normal people first build&nbsp;themselves a house wherein he and his wife can live, before&nbsp;he offers to marry a woman, something we know already&nbsp;from Deuteronomy 20,5: “who is the man that has built a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">house and has not consecrated it, .... and has planted a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">vineyard,...or has become engaged to a woman?” here the Torah illustrates the foolishness of the person who did not do&nbsp;this in the accepted order, and how his plans therefore will&nbsp;not be realised. He only has his own foolishness to blame for&nbsp;this, not fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,32. בניך ובנותיך נתנים לעם אחר</span><span class="font5">, “your sons and your daughters will be given to another nation.” According to the&nbsp;Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yevamot</span><span class="font5"> folio 63, here the Torah speaks of&nbsp;the second wife of a father who maltreats his children from&nbsp;his first wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכלות</span><span class="font5">, an expression describing longing for something in vain. Compare Psalms 84,3, וגם כלתה נפשי, “and my soul&nbsp;almost perished from longing.” (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,33. יאכל עם אשר לא ידעת</span><span class="font5">, “a nation which you do not know will consume it.” They do not do you any favours as&nbsp;they do not even know you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,44. הוא יהיה לראש</span><span class="font5">, “he shall become the head;” this is based on Proverbs 22,7, עבד לוה לאיש מלוה, “the borrower is a&nbsp;slave to the lender.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.49. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כאשר יראה הנשר</span><span class="font5">, “as the eagle sweeps down,” this&nbsp;is a reference to the Babylonian Empire concerning which it&nbsp;has been written in Daniel 7,4: “like a lion with eagles’&nbsp;wings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">גוי אשר לא תשמע לשונו</span><span class="font5">, “a people whose language you do not understand.” This is why you cannot even plead with&nbsp;them and come to terms with them. Apart from that, you can&nbsp;tell from their facial expressions that they are cruel and&nbsp;tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.50. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גוי עז פנים</span><span class="font5">, “a nation of fierce countenance;” this is&nbsp;a reference to the Roman Empire, as we know from Daniel&nbsp;8,23: ובאחרית מלכותם הימים ככלות הפושעים יעמוד מלך עז פנים, “and&nbsp;at the end of their kingdom when the sinners have met their&nbsp;end, a brazen-faced king shall arise;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,54. אשר יותיב</span><span class="font5">, “whom he has remaining;” a reference to the enemy, or: the remnant in hiding. (Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28,59. והפלא</span><span class="font5">, “He will make wonderful, in the sense of the plague being extraordinary long lasting.” The last letter of&nbsp;the word is an א, (not a .(ה</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">רעים ונאמנים</span><span class="font5">, “painful and of long duration;” compare Samuel II 7,16: ונאמן ביתך וממלכתך עד עולם, “and your house&nbsp;and your dynasty will endure for a long time.” Compare also&nbsp;Isaiah 22,3 which both the Targum and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rash’bam&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">understand in the same sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.60. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את כל מדוה מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “all the diseases current in&nbsp;Egypt;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.61. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר לא כתוב</span><span class="font5">, “which have not been recorded (in&nbsp;the Torah);” the Chaldeans used to tie good looking male&nbsp;Jews to their bedposts during the time they engaged in&nbsp;sexual relations with their wives, in order that their wives at&nbsp;the time by looking at these good looking males would&nbsp;become aroused and their babies would resemble what they&nbsp;had seen at that time. It happened once that one of them told&nbsp;his colleague that this is what has been written here, i.e.&nbsp;what is meant by “perversions which have not been recorded&nbsp;in the Torah.” (Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gittin</span><span class="font5"> folio 58.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.68. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;והשיבך ה' מצרים באניות</span><span class="font5">, ”and the Lord will ship you&nbsp;back to Egypt in ships;” there is a river separating the Land&nbsp;of Canaan from Egypt as explained by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on Numbers&nbsp;34,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">באניות</span><span class="font5">, “in ships;” this is a severe punishment, as all kinds of people of both sexes and ages, sick and healthy,&nbsp;were thrown together into the holds of these boats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">28.69. אשר צוה ה' את משה</span><span class="font5">, ”that G’d had commanded Moses. This includes chastisements not told him as a form of&nbsp;revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מלבד הברית</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> explains the reference is to all the curses recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy which have&nbsp;been authored by Moses, but approved by G’d to be said to&nbsp;the people publicly. In some instances he even repeated&nbsp;commandments that had already been recorded in one of the&nbsp;other four Books of Moses. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> calls these curses as&nbsp;having been revealed to Moses already while he stood on&nbsp;Mount Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר כרת אתם</span><span class="font5">. “which He concluded as a covenant with them at Mount Chorev” (Sinai). This is a reference to chapter&nbsp;26 in the Book of Leviticus which Moses wrote down at the&nbsp;end of that Book, before the people had left for their journey&nbsp;after staying around Mount Chorev for about a year, after&nbsp;having been given the Ten Commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,3. ואזנים לשמוע עד היום הזה</span><span class="font5">, “and ears with which to hear until this day.” This day is included in that statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,5</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למען תדעו כי אני ה' אלוקיכם</span><span class="font5">, in order that you will </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">know</span><span class="font5"> that I am the Lord your G’d.” </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Moses</span><span class="font5"> had not spoken&nbsp;these words (i.e. at his own initiative), but from the words:&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואלך אתכם </span><span class="font5">at the beginning of verse 4, until the end of this&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Parshah,</span><span class="font5"> we are reading G’d’s word, as our sages have&nbsp;already explained on Exodus 32,13, in respect of the words:&nbsp;וכל הארץ הזאת אשר אמרתי, “and this whole land of which I have&nbsp;spoken;” we would actually have expected there the word:&nbsp;אמרת, “which You spoke of,” as Moses had been the speaker&nbsp;at the beginning of that verse.” The truth is that as far as&nbsp;there we read the words of the student, from there on we&nbsp;read the words of the Teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,8. ושמרתם את דברי הברית הזאת</span><span class="font5">, “observe therefore the words of this covenant;” you are obligated to do so in light of&nbsp;all the favours the Lord has done for you as recorded earlier.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Nitzavim</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אתם נצבים היום כולכם</span><span class="font5">, “you are standing this day all&nbsp;of you;” all of you regardless of your social standing in the&nbsp;community are equally standing facing the Lord, in order to&nbsp;enter into the new covenant. (see verse 11).This had already&nbsp;been announced by Moses in the verses of our chapter&nbsp;leading up to this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ראשיכם, זקניכם</span><span class="font5">, the leaders of your tribes; </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">who</span><span class="font5"> are these leaders?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">זקניכם ושוטריכם</span><span class="font5">, “your elders and your appointed officials;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מחוטב עציך, </span><span class="font5">“including the hewers of wood, i.e.&nbsp;male servants;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד שואב מימיך, </span><span class="font5">“including the drawers of your water, i.e. female servants.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לעברך</span><span class="font5">, “so that you will participate,” (note the&nbsp;singular mode) i.e. all as if you were one single person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כורת עמך היום</span><span class="font5">, “which He concludes with you this day.” No one can ever claim that he had not been present at that&nbsp;time and had confirmed accepting the covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was the last time the entire nation would be present at the same spot simultaneously, as after the land&nbsp;had been distributed to the tribes, the elderly and the&nbsp;mothers who had just given birth, as well as any sick people&nbsp;could not be expected to come to Jerusalem on the festivals&nbsp;designated for the annual pilgrimages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,15. אשר ישבו בארץ מצרים</span><span class="font5">, “who had dwelled in the land of Egypt;” </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">together</span><span class="font5"> with the ones who had still dwelled in the&nbsp;land of Egypt (who had been minors at the time of the&nbsp;Exodus) and who had experienced all that you have&nbsp;witnessed during the last forty years in the desert, etc. The&nbsp;decree to die in the desert had applied only to males who&nbsp;had been twenty years of age at the time of the Exodus, and&nbsp;had not been older than 60 years at the time when it was&nbsp;issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;פן יש בכ</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שרש פורה ראש ולענה</span><span class="font5">, “lest there be&nbsp;amongst you a root that bears gall and wormwood. “</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;את דברי האלה הזאת</span><span class="font5">, “the words of this curse.” This&nbsp;is a reference to the curses pronounced at Mount Eyval, in&nbsp;chapter 27, 15-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והתברך</span><span class="font5">, “and he blesses himself, i.e. he reassures himself; he considers himself immune from these curses (by&nbsp;interpreting them as applicable only to the community, not to&nbsp;individuals.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי בשרירות לבי אלך</span><span class="font5">, “even though I do my own thing,” i.e. I ignore rules meant for others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">למען ספות הרוה</span><span class="font5">, “the irrigated plants will be swept away with the dried out ones.” He feels that if the community has&nbsp;sinned and G’d will punish them, it makes no difference that&nbsp;he adds a few extra sins which he as an individual indulges&nbsp;in. [He denied G’d’s supervision of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">individuals</span><span class="font5"> who are sinful,&nbsp;as otherwise the community would be made to pay for the&nbsp;sins of each individual. We can perhaps understand this logic&nbsp;as the deluge swept away everyone and they could not all&nbsp;have been equally guilty. He also distinguishes between sins&nbsp;that are due to the evil urge, such as indulging in forbidden&nbsp;but tasty food, and others such as not wearing garments with&nbsp;a mixture of wool and linen, which did not require him to&nbsp;resist temptation. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the line: למען ספות הרוה את הצמאה; he cannot wait until violation of Torah laws becomes&nbsp;popular, so that he may indulge in it openly rather than&nbsp;secretly and make an outcast of himself. In the meantime he&nbsp;has to suffer like a plant suffers that is not irrigated. He may&nbsp;even have restrained himself from sinning although&nbsp;harbouring a fervent desire to do so as he is afraid of being&nbsp;caught and convicted. The Torah appears to compare the&nbsp;righteous to the well watered plant, and the sinner or&nbsp;potential sinner, to the plant that thirsts for water. (Compare&nbsp;Yehudah Halevi quoted by Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,20. והבדילו</span><span class="font5">, “and the Lord shall separate him, etc;” his&nbsp;punishment will correspond to the principle of the punishment&nbsp;matching the sin. He used his individualism as a way to&nbsp;escape punishment; as a retribution he will be singled out for&nbsp;punishment while G’d is not (yet) dealing with communally&nbsp;committed sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לרעה</span><span class="font5">, “for evil;” this had to be spelled out as G’d also singles out people “for good,” when the occasion justifies&nbsp;this. A well known example is the tribe of Levi, who, as the&nbsp;only tribe not to worship the golden calf, was rewarded by&nbsp;being singled out to become a special tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואמר הדור הארון</span><span class="font5">, “and the next generation will say,&nbsp;etc.” Moses refers to a generation that had not yet been born&nbsp;at the time when this covenant was entered into by the&nbsp;Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנכרי אשר מארץ רחוקה</span><span class="font5">, “as well as a stranger who had come from a distant land;” and had not heard about the&nbsp;solemn covenant; he will be astounded at the desolation in&nbsp;the land of Israel between the Jewish people and their G’d;&nbsp;the people around who knew about this covenant and its&nbsp;having breached by the Jewish people will not be surprised&nbsp;at all at what happened to this nation and its land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;גפרית ומלח שרפה כל ארצה</span><span class="font5">, “all of its land having&nbsp;become salt and brimstone;” what is the connection between&nbsp;salt and brimstone? Nothing can withstand fire better than&nbsp;salt, and nothing can be destroyed more totally that when it is&nbsp;treated with brimstone. The Torah means to tell you that if&nbsp;the Israelites had remained loyal to their covenant, they&nbsp;could have withstood any attempt at destruction as salt can&nbsp;withstand it; seeing that they had not, they were destroyed&nbsp;utterly as if they had been rubbed out with brimstone.&nbsp;Brimstone destroys even what the fire had not been able to&nbsp;destroy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ומלח</span><span class="font5">, “and salt;” the Torah had reported that the wife of Lot who had failed to obey the instruction of the angel not to&nbsp;look back, was turned in a pillar of salt. (Genesis 19,26(</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שרפה כל ארצה</span><span class="font5">, “its whole land is as if burned.” Is it conceivable that G’d would become so angry on account of a&nbsp;sin committed by a single individual? The fact is that the&nbsp;destruction of the area occupied by the Ten tribes and the&nbsp;population being sent into exile, had </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">nothing</span><span class="font5"> to do with an&nbsp;individual’s sins, but with erection of </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">public</span><span class="font5"> idols, two golden&nbsp;calves built to block the route to Jerusalem during the lifetime&nbsp;of Solomon’s son Rechavam, hundreds of years before the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kingdom of the Ten Tribes went into exile and the idol erected by Michah, and the appointment as Levites by&nbsp;people not born to members of that tribe. (Judges chapter&nbsp;8,33) The latter phenomena happened already prior to the&nbsp;time of the prophet Samuel and the dynasty of&nbsp;David/Solomon, long </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">before</span><span class="font5"> the Kingdom of Solomon was&nbsp;divided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29,28. הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו</span><span class="font5">, “sins committed in the privacy of one’s home, (which could not be witnessed and brought to&nbsp;court) will be taken care of by the Lord our G’d;” this had to&nbsp;be stated specifically in light of what we read in verse 18&nbsp;about individuals who feel safe from punishment for their&nbsp;personal sins in periods when the community at large is&nbsp;Torah-observant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לה׳ אלוקינו</span><span class="font5">, “it is His duty to punish sins committed in places inaccessible to witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והנגלות</span><span class="font5">, ”but the sins committed publicly, etc,” dealing with deliberate sins committed in full view of the public must&nbsp;be dealt with by the judiciary by both you and your children,&nbsp;as otherwise such phenomena cannot be eradicated from&nbsp;your midst. This law becomes effective from the moment the&nbsp;Jewish people will cross the river Jordan. From that moment&nbsp;on their acceptance of the covenant with G’d meant that&nbsp;each individual Jew shared in the responsibility for the&nbsp;conduct of each fellow Jew. From that moment on we also&nbsp;became responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order that you should not say that this approach applies forever (under all circumstances), the words והנגלות&nbsp;לנו ולבנינו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">and the publicly committed sins are also the&nbsp;responsibility of us and our children,” have been dotted, i. e.&nbsp;as long as we observe that part of the law, by letting our&nbsp;judiciary punish sinners of sins committed in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">public</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">G’d</span><span class="font5"> will&nbsp;take care of those that were committed </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">secretly</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[The dots, wherever they appear, have been added by learned scribes long after the Torah had been given, i.e.&nbsp;have been added by </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">human</span><span class="font5"> initiative. There are dots only on&nbsp;ten letters, whereas there are eleven sins that were listed in&nbsp;the list of curses as being typical of sins committed secretly&nbsp;in Deuteronomy chapter 27, commencing with verse 15. This&nbsp;is deliberate in order to avoid giving the impression that we&nbsp;are telling G’d how to administer His laws. This is also the&nbsp;reason why the dots which we would have expected over the&nbsp;words לה' אלוקינו, where they would have made more sense,&nbsp;appear instead over the words לנו ולבנינו, Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו</span><span class="font5">, when the prophet Isaiah, at the end of describing the idyllic state of mankind on earth after the&nbsp;arrival of the Messiah, states that G’d will also select priests&nbsp;and Levites from among the gentile nations,(Isaiah 66,13)&nbsp;this is also something reserved for G’d’s judgment, covered&nbsp;by the line הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו, “that there are hidden matters&nbsp;which only G’d is aware of,” not man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30.3. ושב ה' את שבותך</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord will return with you from your captivity;” in chapter29,27, G’d had been described as&nbsp;expelling His people from the Holy Land to any other land,&nbsp;now, if the people have repented their wrongdoings, He&nbsp;promises to bring them back and remain with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,9. כאשר שש על אבותיך</span><span class="font5">, ”as He used to take delight in your forefathers.” This is a reference to the generation who&nbsp;inherited the Holy Land. G’d is addressing the exiles at this&nbsp;point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,10</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי תשמע בקול...כי תשוב</span><span class="font5">, “if you will listen to the</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">that the time for the redemption from exile depends on two factors, a) penitence, b) performance of both the positive&nbsp;commandments and avoiding the transgressions listed in the&nbsp;negative commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הכתובה</span><span class="font5">, “which has been recorded in writing; we would have expected this word to be in the plural mode as it covers&nbsp;multiple laws. Instead we find a singular feminine mode. This&nbsp;is not something unique; for instance we find something&nbsp;analogous in Exodus 17,12 where Moses’ hands are&nbsp;described as remaining steady, i.e. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהי ידיו אמונה</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10,13. ולא מעבר לים היא</span><span class="font5">, “neither is it beyond the ocean;” this refers to the Mediterranean, which man cannot cross as&nbsp;even if he had a ship, the surface of the waters are dark and&nbsp;he would get lost at night.

<p><span class="font5">If you will perform the commandments in the Torah heaven and earth will testify on your behalf; if not, they will&nbsp;testify at the heavenly tribunal against you. They will do this&nbsp;by heaven denying the essential rain to make your crops&nbsp;ripen. (Deut. 11,17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30,30. כי הוא חייך</span><span class="font5">, “for He is your life;” a reference to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Vayelech</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וילך משה</span><span class="font5">, “Moses went;” from near the Tabernacle&nbsp;where he had his residence, as we know from: והחונים לפני&nbsp;משכן ה' משה אהרן ובניו, “and the ones encamped in front of the&nbsp;Tent of meeting: Moses, Aaron and his sons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He now went from each tribe to the next to advise them of his impending death. He assured them that they had&nbsp;nothing to fear from his impending death, but that they&nbsp;should take heart and support their new leader Joshua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why did Moses feel that he had to address and reassure each tribe separately? Why did he not merely use&nbsp;his trumpets and call a great assembly of the whole nation?&nbsp;According to Rabbi Joshua in the name of Rabbi Levi of&nbsp;Sakkinon, the trumpets which had been Moses’ private&nbsp;property, G’d had asked him to hide these trumpets so that&nbsp;no one else ever would blow them, not even he himself, as it&nbsp;would have been unseemly to do so on the day when he&nbsp;knew he was going to die. On that day Moses’ control over&nbsp;events had come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אמר אלי לא תעבור את הירדן הזה</span><span class="font5">, “He had said to me:&nbsp;you will not cross this river Jordan.” You, the people, will not&nbsp;lose anything by that fact, as G’d Himself will cross the river&nbsp;Jordan ahead of you, leading you. (verse 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'כאשר דבר ה</span><span class="font5">, “as the Lord had said.” This is a&nbsp;reference to Deuteronomy 18,15, where G’d had promised:&nbsp;“that He would raise a prophet amongst them, just like&nbsp;Moses.” He had also told him to take Joshua the son of Nun&nbsp;who had been filled with the spirit of G’d (Numbers 27,18).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,5. אשר צויתי אתכם</span><span class="font5">, “which I have commanded you.” This is a reference to Deut. 20,16, where G’d had&nbsp;commanded the Jewish people not to allow a single soul of&nbsp;the Canaanites to remain alive, (unless they had left that land&nbsp;of their own accord).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,7. לעיני כל ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “in the sight of all of Israel;” this was&nbsp;necessary so that none of them would ever be able to say to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Joshua that as long as Moses had been alive he had not had permission to assume the mantle of leadership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אתה תבא את העם הזה, </span><span class="font5">“for you will come </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">with</span><span class="font5"> this people;” seeing that here Moses was speaking with Joshua&nbsp;in the presence of the whole people, he honoured the Jewish&nbsp;people by not saying that Joshua would go ahead of them&nbsp;when crossing the Jordan, but that they would walk&nbsp;alongside them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.9. 'אל הכהנים בני לוי הנושאים את הארון וגו, </span><span class="font5">“to the priests the members of the tribe of Levi, who were charged with&nbsp;carrying the Holy Ark, etc.” Even though it was the Levites&nbsp;who carried the Holy Ark, and not the priests, (Numbers 7,8)&nbsp;as soon as Moses had died, the priests carried the Holy Ark&nbsp;when the Israelites were in the process of crossing the river&nbsp;Jordan. (Compare Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 33). They did&nbsp;so again when the people marched around Jericho and when&nbsp;they returned the Ark to its place in the days of King&nbsp;Solomon, when it was transferred from the Tabernacle.&nbsp;(Kings I 8,6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: seeing that it was the priests who </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">assigned</span><span class="font5"> the transportation of the Ark to the Levites, as&nbsp;spelled out in Numbers 4,5, they could have been described&nbsp;as the prime movers. They were referred to there as נושאי&nbsp;הארון, “the carriers of the Ark.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מקץ שבע שנים</span><span class="font5">, “at the end of (every) seven years;”&nbsp;at the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">beginning</span><span class="font5"> of the eight’s year. [The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> year. Ed.]&nbsp;This was in order to enable the idle farmers to devote the&nbsp;whole year to the study of the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בבא כל ישראל, </span><span class="font5">“when the whole Jewish nation would come” (on the pilgrimage for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במועד שנת השנה</span><span class="font5">, “on the feast of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sukkot;”</span><span class="font5"> seeing that this year is the first year in the new </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> cycle which&nbsp;comprises seven years, why does the Torah refer to that&nbsp;year in the singular mode, i.e. שנת השמטה, the year of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah?</span><span class="font5"> The reason is that many of the restrictions that&nbsp;applied during the previous year were still in force, such as&nbsp;the residue of the “harvest” of the previous year. (Compare&nbsp;Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rosh Hashanah</span><span class="font5"> folio 12.) It is stated there&nbsp;that any crop which had completed one third of its growth&nbsp;before the end of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sh’mittah</span><span class="font5"> year was still considered as&nbsp;subject to the regulations applicable during that year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;תקרא את התורה הזאת</span><span class="font5">, “you shall read out publicly&nbsp;this Torah;” this commandment was addressed to Joshua.&nbsp;This is why he is also referred to as the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הקהל את העם</span><span class="font5">, “assemble the nation;” they are all&nbsp;available not having chores to attend to, seeing that they are&nbsp;not at home but in Jerusalem (or wherever the Tabernacle&nbsp;stood prior to Jerusalem having been captured by David&nbsp;about 400 years later).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר הוא בא שמה בקרבו</span><span class="font5">, “to which it (the nation of&nbsp;Israel) goes to be among them.” The words: בקרב הארץ, are&nbsp;treated as in the masculine mode, just as in Genesis 13,6:&nbsp;ולא נשא אותם הארץ, “and the land could not support (both) of&nbsp;them;” or as in Isaiah 9,18: נעתם ארץ, “the earth was shaken.”&nbsp;[The word ארץ, ארצות, “land, lands,” is treated as a feminine&nbsp;noun in the vast majority of instances when it occurs. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31.17. והסתרתי פני מהם</span><span class="font5">, “I will hide My face from them.”&nbsp;This is evidence of G’d’s fondness of the Jewish people, His&nbsp;acting like a father who while forced to discipline his son&nbsp;cannot bring himself to watch the pain he is inflicting upon&nbsp;him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,19. ולמדה את בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “and teach it to the Children of Israel!” G’d is speaking in this way to Joshua. [Seeing that&nbsp;Moses will no longer be around, as he is dying on this day, it&nbsp;is clear that these words must have been addressed to his&nbsp;successor. Ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,21. וענתה השירה הזאת</span><span class="font5">, “and this song shall testify before them as a witness;” we must imagine this as if the&nbsp;“song” will reply to those who say “why have all these&nbsp;disasters befallen us?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לפניו</span><span class="font5">, “in response to this;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי לא תשכח מפי זרעו</span><span class="font5">, “it shall not be forgotten from the mouth of their offspring;” although there are many&nbsp;chastisements, eventually this will end in words of comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,23. ויצו את יהושע</span><span class="font5">, “He commanded Joshua;” The Lord commanded him (not Moses) These words refer to verse 14&nbsp;in our chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אתה תביא כי</span><span class="font5">, “for you are going to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">bring</span><span class="font5">;” seeing that the people were not present at the time when G’d said these&nbsp;words to Joshua, G’d did not have to pay them a special&nbsp;compliment, as Moses had done in verse 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,25. ויצו משה את הלוים</span><span class="font5">, “Moses ordered the Levites, etc.” these are the Levites who had been mentioned in verse&nbsp;9 as the “priests, who were the sons of the Levites;” Moses&nbsp;was not addressing the tribe of the Levites here. After all, the&nbsp;Levites at large were not charged with touching the Holy Ark,&nbsp;much less carrying it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">31,28. ואעידה בם את השמים ואת הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “and I will appoint as witnesses against them Heaven and Earth.” It is a&nbsp;historical fact that during the life time of Joshua and the&nbsp;elders of his time who survived him, the Jewish people&nbsp;remained absolutely loyal to G’d and His Torah. (Joshua&nbsp;24,31)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">21,30. את דברי השירה הזאת</span><span class="font5">, “the words of this song;” this is a reference to the next portion, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Haazinu,</span><span class="font5"> the major part of&nbsp;which consists of Moses’ parting song/poem to his nation.&nbsp;The subject is that G’d had provided for them in the desert as&nbsp;well as in the land of Israel, and how in spite of this they&nbsp;would forsake Him and be exiled, until eventually they would&nbsp;be redeemed from exile.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Ha-azinu</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,1. האזינו השמים</span><span class="font5">, “hearken o heaven, etc.;” the word האזינו is derived from אזן, “ear.” Moses asks the heavens and&nbsp;the earth to lend their ears to what he is about to say. This is&nbsp;a direct continuation of the last verse in the previous portion,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vayelech,</span><span class="font5"> in which he had announced this poem/song to the&nbsp;people. He now calls on the eternal heaven and earth to act&nbsp;as witnesses to what he had to say, seeing that he, as a&nbsp;mortal, cannot do so anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">האזינו השמים</span><span class="font5">, “you have been witnesses when I gave the Torah to this people,” as Moses quoted G’d as saying in&nbsp;Exodus 20,20: כי מן השמים דברתי עמכם, “for I have spoken with&nbsp;you from the heaven;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">האזינו, </span><span class="font5">Moses addresses the heavens in the plural mode as there are a number of different heavens making up many&nbsp;layers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותשמע הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “hear o earth,” singular mode, there being only one earth, seeing that the people were standing on it&nbsp;when they had said: נעשה ושמע, “we will carry out the laws of&nbsp;the Torah as soon as we will </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hear</span><span class="font5"> them” (Exodus 24,7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">האזינו השמים ותשמע הארץ</span><span class="font5">, the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 1,2) took his cue from Moses, when he said: שמעו שמים והאזיני ארץ,&nbsp;“hear o heavens and give ear o earth;” when Moses recited&nbsp;this poem he was far from heaven, standing on earth; this is&nbsp;why the verb to describe hearing that he used was האזינו&nbsp;when addressing the heavens. One normally addresses first&nbsp;the people most distant and asks them to pay attention to&nbsp;what one has to say. Isaiah, who spoke at the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">instruction</span><span class="font5"> of&nbsp;the Lord, felt closer to heaven at that time, so that he&nbsp;reversed the use of the terms שמע and האזין respectively.&nbsp;When speaking to someone close by, the expression !האזין is&nbsp;not appropriate. Isaiah, at the time considered himself as&nbsp;closer to heaven than to earth, seeing that he delivered a&nbsp;message from G’d in the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">heaven</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some commentators feel that exactly the opposite is true, and that the expression האזין, is the correct expression&nbsp;to be used when addressing someone close by, whereas the&nbsp;expression שמע is reserved for some further away. Moses&nbsp;who was so familiar with heaven and what goes on there,&nbsp;commenced with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">האזינו </span><span class="font5">therefore, and used the term שמע to&nbsp;call on the earth to listen, as by that time he was no longer at&nbsp;home on earth and had almost been completely absorbed by&nbsp;the heavenly regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">השמים, </span><span class="font5">with the definitive prefix ה, makes it plain that he addresses the whole range of angels who have their homes&nbsp;in heavenly regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והארץ</span><span class="font5">, and similarly, all the forces active on earth as part of what we call: “nature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,2. יערוף כמטר לקחי</span><span class="font5">, “may my discourse come down as rain;” the words that I am going to address to you are not&nbsp;meaningless, but just as the value of the rain when it comes&nbsp;down to earth is not immediately visible and felt as a benefit,&nbsp;nonetheless eventually it is responsible for the growing and&nbsp;ripening of the fruit on the trees, and its benefit becomes&nbsp;evident.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of Moses’ introductory comments: may it be the Lord’s will that my words will not&nbsp;return to me empty, but that they will grow like fruit in your&nbsp;hearts and in the hearts of all those who listen to them. May&nbsp;they act like the dew on the earth which promotes the growth&nbsp;of the grain crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses mentions four different directions on earth here, as we will see, and just as he has called heaven and earth as&nbsp;witnesses, he appeals separately to all the four winds&nbsp;blowing from the four directions on the surfaces of the earth,&nbsp;north and south, east and west. He implies that if the Jewish&nbsp;people will conduct themselves as G’d wishes them to&nbsp;conduct themselves, the winds from each of these four&nbsp;directions will blow beneficially for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יערוף כמטר</span><span class="font5">, this is a reference to west wind which originates in the neck of the world and usually brings rain in&nbsp;its wake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תזל כטל אמרתי, </span><span class="font5">“may my speech distil just as the dew.” This is a reference to the northern wind, which is pleasant&nbsp;just like the dew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כשעירים עלי דשא</span><span class="font5">, “as the small rain on the tender grass;” this is a reference to the wind blowing from the south which&nbsp;is stormy like its namesake, the billy goats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כרביבים</span><span class="font5">, “and like the showers on the herbs.” This is a reference to the east wind, which is beneficial for seedlings&nbsp;and which blows most of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the opinion of our author, the east wind blows mostly in the morning, the south wind around noon,&nbsp;the west wind at the beginning of the night, and the northern&nbsp;wind around midnight. The northern wind is prevalent during&nbsp;the summer, when it is welcome, whereas when it blows in&nbsp;the winter it is difficult to bear; the opposite is the case with&nbsp;the wind originating in the south. The western wind is difficult&nbsp;to bear at any time. [I presume the latter observations are&nbsp;meant to describe </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">human</span><span class="font5"> reactions, as opposed to the&nbsp;reactions of the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">earth</span><span class="font5">. Ed.] Eastern winds (i.e. sandstorms&nbsp;originating in the east) are never welcome from the&nbsp;perspective of human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,3</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי שם ה' אקרא</span><span class="font5">, “for I will proclaim the Holy Name of the Lord;” this refers to Moses’ previous reference to heaven&nbsp;and earth; he tells his people that at all times they need to&nbsp;proclaim the greatness of the Lord both in heaven an on&nbsp;earth; this is similar to the psalmist proclaiming in Psalms&nbsp;69,35: הללוהו שמים וארץ, “praise the heavens and the earth!”&nbsp;The psalmist also phrases this thought when he said (Psalms&nbsp;19,2) השמים מספרים כבוד א-ל, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">the heavens tell of the glory of&nbsp;G’d.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font5">do all this whenever we read the Torah in public&nbsp;and a forum of ten male adults is present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet Jeremiah, 33,25, has taught us that G’d is on record as saying that if it were not for His covenant with&nbsp;the Jewish people, He would not consider it worthwhile to&nbsp;have created the universe, i.e. day or night and all of nature&nbsp;that goes with it. The letters in the names of G’d themselves&nbsp;provide a hint, 6 letters which in addition to the four directions&nbsp;of earth point to heaven and earth themselves, i.e. the&nbsp;number 6 reminding us of the number of days G’d took to&nbsp;create our universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי שם ה' אקרא</span><span class="font5">, these words have been interpreted by the author of the Jerusalem Talmud as meaning that Moses&nbsp;prophesied: “woe to you sinful the gentiles who mention the&nbsp;Holy Name of the Lord;” Even the angels are not able to&nbsp;pronounce that holy name until after the Jewish people here&nbsp;on earth have proclaimed it in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kedushah,</span><span class="font5"> by saying: קדוש&nbsp;קדוש קדוש three times. It was Moses who here provided the&nbsp;key to praising G’d in this mode. There are 21 words from the&nbsp;beginning of our portion, containing 85 letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri,</span><span class="font5"> Moses said: “I am satisfied to be immediately behind in rank to seven angels,” i.e. to recite the&nbsp;holy Name of G’d after these twenty one words. This is the&nbsp;reason why the sages arranged for the part of our daily&nbsp;prayers known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“kedushah”</span><span class="font5"> to comprise a total of 21&nbsp;words. [The 21 words are: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נקדש את שמך בעולם כשם שמקדישים&nbsp;אותו בשמי מרום, וכן כתוב על יד נביאך וקרא זה אל זה ואמר </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">קדוש הדוש</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">קדוש</span><span class="font5">. In the corresponding morning </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kedushah</span><span class="font5"> prayer on&nbsp;Sabbath mornings, there are 85 words, beginning with: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">נקדישך&nbsp;ונעריצך כסוד שיח שרפי קודש המקדישים שמד בקודש וגו'.</span><span class="font5"> We are not&nbsp;allowed to pronounce the critical words: קדוש קדוש קדוש until&nbsp;after an introduction of 85 words. The same is true of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kedushah</span><span class="font5"> prayer in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mussaph</span><span class="font5"> service, which commences&nbsp;with words: 'כתר יתנו לך המוני מעלה וגו.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,4. הצור תמים פעליו</span><span class="font5">, “The Rock, all of whose works are perfect;” this is again a reference to the “heaven and earth,”&nbsp;and the four directions on earth, north south, east and west.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תמים פעליו</span><span class="font5">, all of G’d’s activities are performed in a perfect manner, as opposed to the works performed by man.&nbsp;When a human being constructs a building it will always be&nbsp;found that when he reviews it, that he had omitted something&nbsp;which needs replacing, adding, removing, or changing. Not&nbsp;so with anything G’d has constructed. One of the reasons&nbsp;man cannot complete something perfectly at the first try is&nbsp;that he has not created the raw materials that he uses in the&nbsp;building’s construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי כל דרכיו משפט</span><span class="font5">, “for all His ways are just;” Moses wants to tell the Jewish people that although in the limited time that&nbsp;man spends on earth he cannot always live long enough;&nbsp;however, all that G’d has planned works out perfectly in the&nbsp;end, the fact is that G’d judges His people first for their wrong&nbsp;doings, (something that results in their repentance and&nbsp;rehabilitation) whereas He deals with the gentile nations later&nbsp;but they will not then have a chance to rehabilitate&nbsp;themselves.) The details of how this works will be spelled out&nbsp;in the verses following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שחת לו לא בניו</span><span class="font5">, “Is corruption </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">His?</span><span class="font5"> No His children’s&nbsp;is the blemish.” Did G’d cause them to become corrupted, so&nbsp;that they would no longer be His children? Compare Hoseah&nbsp;2,1: !לא עמי אתם, “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">You</span><span class="font5"> are not My people!” Rather it was your&nbsp;sins which have made you corrupt, so that you are no longer&nbsp;fit to be identified with your “father” in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בניו מומם</span><span class="font5">, “His children have become blemished, have caused it themselves;” Compare Leviticus 22,25, (according&nbsp;to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Seforno)</span><span class="font5"> כי משחתם בהם מום בם, “for their corruption is within&nbsp;them, not only external.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?הלה' תגמלו זאת</span><span class="font5">, ”is this how you requite the Lord?”&nbsp;Do you repay His favours to you by worshipping other&nbsp;deities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולא חכם</span><span class="font5">, ”you surely are most unwise!” You have not acquired any wisdom. The word is a verb, i.e. החכים, “he&nbsp;became wise.” The reason why we have two vowels </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">here is on account of the phrase here terminating with the&nbsp;dividing cantillation sign </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">etnachta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">קנך</span><span class="font5">, from תקון, healthy, in good condition. Compare Psalms 78,54: הר זה קנתה ימינו, “His right hand had acquired&nbsp;this mountain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.7</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;זכור ימות עולם</span><span class="font5">, “remember the days of old;” Moses&nbsp;now proceeds to remind the people of a whole list of acts of&nbsp;loving kindness G’d had performed for them </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בינו שנות דור ודור</span><span class="font5">, “consider the years of many generations.” G’d had prepared a specific land on earth for&nbsp;the Jewish people already long before they had come into&nbsp;existence. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בהנחל עליון גוים</span><span class="font5">, “When the Most High gave to the&nbsp;gentile nations, etc.;” He allocated to each nation its territory&nbsp;on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בהפרידו בני אדם, </span><span class="font5">“at the time when He separated the children of man,” i.e. after the destruction of the Tower they&nbsp;had built. (Genesis chapter 11, 1-9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יצב גבולות עמים למספר בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “He set the borders of the peoples according to the number of the Children of Israel.”&nbsp;He set aside 12 portions of land for the as yet unborn 12&nbsp;founding fathers of the Jewish nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a tradition that the twelve sons of Canaan (listed in Genesis chapter 10, where eleven have been&nbsp;named) who used to be slaves of the descendants of Shem,&nbsp;son of Noach, as per the curse of their grandfather Noach,&nbsp;received the lands which in due course were taken over from&nbsp;them by the 12 tribes of Israel under the leadership of&nbsp;Joshua. When the Israelites took over, the former inhabitants&nbsp;had no legal claim against the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">at all</span><span class="font5">, as whatever slaves&nbsp;“own,” is really the property of their masters, and seeing that&nbsp;the Israelites were descendants of Shem, the Canaanites’&nbsp;master, they had not had any title to that land </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ever</span><span class="font5">. It is not&nbsp;surprising that one these tribes of Canaan split into two,&nbsp;during the approximately 300 years between the end of the&nbsp;deluge and the time of Avraham. The author has mentioned&nbsp;this tradition already in his commentary on Leviticus 20,24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,9. כי חלק ה׳ עמו</span><span class="font5">, “for the portion of the Lord is His people.” He took His own share just as all the nations of the&nbsp;earth took a share each. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יעקב חבל נחלתו</span><span class="font5">, “Yaakov the lot of His inheritance;” there is a repetition here as the word חבל is understood as meaning&nbsp;the same as the word חלק. We find this word used in this&nbsp;sense in Psalms 16.6: חבלים נפלו לי</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">“tracts of land have fallen&nbsp;to my lot;” the same word is also used as meaning:&nbsp;“inheritance,” as one measures land by using a חבל, “rope.”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בדד ינחנו</span><span class="font5">, “the Lord all by Himself did lead him;” in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri,</span><span class="font5"> the word ינחנו is perceived as derived from מנוחה&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“</span><span class="font5">rest</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">;” </span><span class="font5">G’d is understood by Moses as promising that in the&nbsp;future the Jewish people will experience rest and&nbsp;contentment in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ירכיבהו על במותי ארץ</span><span class="font5">, “He would make him ride on&nbsp;the high places on the earth;” we have a parallel of this&nbsp;promise in Isaiah 58,14: והרכבתיך על במותיך תדרוך</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">I’ll set you&nbsp;astride the heights of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">במותי ארץ</span><span class="font5">, “the princes of the earth;” as in Deuteronomy 33 29: ואתה על במותימו תדרוך, “and you shall tread on their high&nbsp;places.” The letter ו is extraneous, and the letter מ should&nbsp;have a short vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kametz, chataf kametz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויניקהו דבש מסלע</span><span class="font5">, “He made him suck honey from a rock;” this is a reference to the honey from dates which grows on&nbsp;palm trees between rocks and in the mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: the honey found in the crags of rocks is bee honey, as the bees hide it there. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">This would be in accordance with Rabbi Joseph quoted in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Targum</span><span class="font5"> when interpreting the line; כאשר תעשינה הדבורים,&nbsp;“as the bees produce”</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">on Deuteronomy 1,44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושמן מחלמיש צור</span><span class="font5">, “and oil out of a flinty rock.” It is the habit of olive trees to grow in areas surrounded by rocky&nbsp;earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עם חלב כליות חטה</span><span class="font5">, “with the kidney fat of wheat.”&nbsp;With the fat from the best grades of wheat, i.e. this kind of&nbsp;wheat is likened to the fat surrounding the kidneys. The&nbsp;kernels of such wheat are described as big as a kidney.&nbsp;These kernels have an indentation and a shape similar to&nbsp;kernels of wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עשהו</span><span class="font5">, “Who made him;” the word: עשה here is a&nbsp;simile for wealth, עושר, as in Numbers 24,18: וישראל עושה חיל,&nbsp;where it means that Israel is abandoning the G’d who has&nbsp;made it wealthy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[This editor admits that he has not understood the interpretation nor its comparison to Numbers 24,18.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,17. לשדים</span><span class="font5">, “to demons;” the word is derived from the&nbsp;root </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שדד</span><span class="font5">, “to ruin, lay waste.” Demons have that effect on the&nbsp;brains of human beings. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא ידעום</span><span class="font5">, “that they have not known;” the brain of human beings is described as not possessing knowledge, as&nbsp;opposed to G’d Who is always described as “knowing,” i.e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וידע אלוקים</span><span class="font5">, (Exodus 2,25) or כי ידעתי את מכאוביו, ”for I have&nbsp;known its pains;” (Exodus 3, 7) The so-called “deities” which&nbsp;idolaters worship have absolutely no knowledge of the&nbsp;emotions of the people who worship them. As to the reason&nbsp;why such “deities” cannot help their worshippers, this is&nbsp;because they are new, often even of more recent origin than&nbsp;their worshippers, .חדשים מקרוב באו</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לא שערום אבותיכם</span><span class="font5">, “your fathers had not been in dread of them.” (their hairs, שער, did not stand on edge in fear of&nbsp;them.) Seeing that they did not punish your forefathers, פקד,&nbsp;you had no reason to fear them and sinned relentlessly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,18. צור ילדך</span><span class="font5">, “of the Rock that begot you,” the word is&nbsp;used in the conjugation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kal,</span><span class="font5"> actively, although its meaning is&nbsp;causative; we find an example of this mode in Genesis&nbsp;10,24: וארפכשד ילד את שלח, “and Arpachshad sired Shalach,”&nbsp;instead of הוליד. Similarly, in the same verse: ושלח ילד את עבר,&nbsp;“and Shalach sired Ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">תשי</span><span class="font5">, “was unmindful;” the letter י in this word, is just like the letter י in Jeremiah 18,23: אל-תמחי, where it is also&nbsp;superfluous and the prophet could have written: אל תמח, “do&nbsp;not wipe out!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מחוללך</span><span class="font5">, “that bore you;” a reminder how when you were (brought out of Egypt you danced for joy and sang songs;&nbsp;מחולות, dances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.20. אסתירה פני מהם, </span><span class="font5">“I will hide My face from them;” by&nbsp;doing so I will await what awaits them when I do not&nbsp;supervise their fate every minute. We will see how useful the&nbsp;stars will be which they worship instead of Me. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי דור תהפוכות המה</span><span class="font5">, “for they are a perverse generation;” only yesterday they said: “we will carry out everything the&nbsp;Lord bids us to do as soon as we will hear the details;”&nbsp;(Exodus 24,7) today they say to a golden calf: “you have&nbsp;taken us out of Egypt.” (Exodus 32,4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בלא עם</span><span class="font5">, “with a vile nation.” (literally, a no-nation).&nbsp;Compare Isaiah 23,13: &quot;זה העם לא היה&quot; “this nation never&nbsp;existed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי אש קדחה באפי</span><span class="font5">, “for a fire is kindled in My&nbsp;nostril;” the jealousy kindled that fire in G’d’s nostril.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of this simile: though written in the active mode, this word is to be understood as if it had&nbsp;been written in the passive mode, i.e. נקדחה. We have other&nbsp;examples of words written in the active mode actually&nbsp;portraying something that has happened, i.e. passive; one&nbsp;such example is found in Genesis 14,3: כל אלה חברו, “all these&nbsp;(kings) came together,” whereas we would have expected&nbsp;the reflexive/passive mode נתחברו. (Compare Ibn Ezra)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותאכל ארץ ויבולה</span><span class="font5">, “ it has consumed the earth and its produce.” This happened in order to starve your people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ותלהט מוסדי הרים</span><span class="font5">, “and sets ablaze the foundations of the mountains.” Anyone hiding beneath the mountains will be&nbsp;forced to flee from fear of the approaching enemies. As an&nbsp;example, we may recall Judges 6,2, when the Israelites had&nbsp;dug tunnels to hide in caves from their adversaries under the&nbsp;mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of this simile: “setting the base of mountains ablaze,” means that they could not flee&nbsp;there on account of the fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אספה</span><span class="font5">, “I will heap;” from the word אסיפה,&nbsp;collecting. The root is used also in Numbers 32,14: לספות עוד&nbsp;על חרון אף ה', “to augment still further G’d’s anger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מזי רעב</span><span class="font5">, “the wasting due to famine;” burned by&nbsp;hunger; compare Daniel 3,19, למזי לאתונא, “to heat up the&nbsp;kiln;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ולחמי רשף</span><span class="font5">, “their flesh consumed by the vultures;” compare Proverbs 9,5: לכו לחמו בלחמי, “come and eat my&nbsp;bread;” (compare the commentaries on that phrase there.)&nbsp;Compare also Job 5,7: ובני רשף יגביהו עוף</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">as the sparks fly&nbsp;upwards.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אמרתי אפאיהם</span><span class="font5">, “I said I would make an end of&nbsp;them;” the word is related to פיאה, “corner, remnant,” I would&nbsp;not even leave a remnant of them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(B’chor shor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ולא ה' פעל כל זאת</span><span class="font5">, “and that not the Lord had&nbsp;brought all this about.” [Moses is quoting the enemies of the&nbsp;Jewish people. Ed.] They deny that our misfortune was G’d’s&nbsp;way of chastising His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי גוי אובד עצות המה </span><span class="font5">, “for they are a people void of&nbsp;counsel;” There are two opposing interpretations in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">concerning who are the subject in this phrase; according to&nbsp;Rabbi Yehudah, the subject are the Jewish people;&nbsp;according to Rabbi Nechemyah, the subject are the gentile&nbsp;nations, who have no concept of how G’d’s ways of&nbsp;educational punishment works. According to Rabbi</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nechemyah the words refer to what the gentile nations were quoted as saying in verse 27. According to Rabbi Yehudah,&nbsp;the Jewish people had rejected all the sound advice G’d had&nbsp;given them about how to live their lives by following the rules&nbsp;of the Torah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לו חכמו</span><span class="font5">, “if they (the Israelites) had been wise;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ישכילו זאת</span><span class="font5">, “they would understand this;” Moses will</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">elaborate on what the “this” is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יבינו לאחריתם</span><span class="font5">, “they would understand that what has happened to them lately had been the natural result of their&nbsp;disloyalty to the covenant they had entered into with&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem.</span><span class="font5"> What should have made them realise all this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'איכה ירדוף וג</span><span class="font5">ו, “how could </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">one</span><span class="font5"> chase a thousand?&nbsp;How could a situation have changed so radically that&nbsp;whereas previously one Israelite could put 1000 gentiles to&nbsp;flight, and two Israelites could put ten thousand adversaries&nbsp;to flight, whereas now one gentile can put one thousand&nbsp;Israelites to flight, whereas by now the situation is reversed?&nbsp;Not only must we marvel at this fact but we must ask&nbsp;ourselves </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">why</span><span class="font5"> something like this could have happened? Is it&nbsp;not obvious that this could only have happened because our&nbsp;“Rock” has abandoned us? Our author sites as proof that&nbsp;Moses was not exaggerating (Judges 20,10).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">רבבה</span><span class="font5">, “ten thousand;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ושנים יניסו רבבה </span><span class="font5">“and two men can put ten thousand of their adversaries to flight;” in other words, one can even put&nbsp;five thousand of the enemy to flight. When the Israelites were&nbsp;loyal to the Torah, the Torah described Leviticus 26,8, five as&nbsp;putting one hundred of the enemy to flight. When they were&nbsp;disloyal to the Torah the ratio of their enemies putting them&nbsp;to flight is multiplied; in fact when the Israelites pursue their&nbsp;enemies they catch them so fast that no astronomical figures&nbsp;have to be mentioned. The enemies fall before them like&nbsp;flies, do not need to be pursued for any great distance. When&nbsp;the Torah speaks of us fleeing, it does not mention being&nbsp;killed, rather it mentions that we will be so nervous that even&nbsp;when no pursuer is in sight we will flee. (Leviticus 26,17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי לא כצורנו צורם</span><span class="font5">, “for not like our Rock, is their&nbsp;“rock;” this is still part of the rhetorical question asked by&nbsp;Moses in verse 30: “how can one man pursue one&nbsp;thousand?” In spite of all this, our enemies still insist on&nbsp;sitting in judgment of us! Our erstwhile success and present&nbsp;failure can only be ascribed to Divine interference both then&nbsp;and now. It is due to their Rock having sold them because of&nbsp;their sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי מגפן סדום גפנם</span><span class="font5">, “for is then their vine of the vine&nbsp;of Sodom, and are then their grapes those that originate in&nbsp;Amora? (sister city of Sodom of old) Are all their thoughts&nbsp;sinful as the ones from those two cities, and is there nothing&nbsp;remotely sacred left in their philosophies? Did I not plant&nbsp;them as noble vines, etc.? (Jeremiah 2,21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.34. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;הלא הוא כמוס עמדי</span><span class="font5">, “is this not laid up in store with&nbsp;Me?” Moses refers to the day when retribution for all their&nbsp;sins will come, as will be explained forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.35</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> לי נקם ושלם</span><span class="font5">, “vengeance is Mine and recompense;” G’d will be paid back by the Jewish people for&nbsp;the sins that He had to watch them indulge in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחש עתידות למו</span><span class="font5">, “and the things that are to come will make haste in arriving. This is one of the examples of&nbsp;masculine and feminine modes being used apparently&nbsp;indiscriminately. [The word עתידות is in the feminine mode,&nbsp;whereas the word למו, is an adjective in the masculine&nbsp;mode. Ed.] Other examples of such inconsistent grammatical&nbsp;combinations are found in: Deut, 22,23: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יהיה נערה בתולה</span><span class="font5">,&nbsp;when there is (masculine pronoun) “when there is a young&nbsp;virgin;” or in Deut. 21,3: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">והיה</span><span class="font5"> העיר הקרובה, “and the nearest city&nbsp;will be etc.; the word עיר is feminine, where as the pronoun&nbsp;והיה is in the masculine mode. The author quotes more such&nbsp;examples. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ידין</span><span class="font5">, “for He will judge, etc.” this kind of&nbsp;judgment involves the sinner having to endure painful&nbsp;experiences on his body. An example of this is found in Job&nbsp;36,31: בם ידין עמים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">by means of these things He controls&nbsp;people” (judges people), giving or denying them their food&nbsp;supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ועל עבדיו יתנחם</span><span class="font5">, “and He will repent Himself for His servants.” When His erstwhile servants who had become&nbsp;disloyal but had subsequently done penitence, He will repent&nbsp;His harsh decrees. We find confirmation of this in Jeremiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">18,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יראה כי אזלת יד</span><span class="font5">, “when He sees that its strength is spent;” compare Isaiah 51,21: ושכורת ולא מיין, “and drunk but&nbsp;not from wine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.37. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ואמר אי אלהימו</span><span class="font5">, and it is said: “where are their&nbsp;deities?” (a mocking question by Israel’s enemies) It makes&nbsp;fun of the people whom G’d had spent so much effort to&nbsp;redeem from Egypt, and who by now have fallen so low. All&nbsp;the deities they worship now in lieu of their G’d do not have&nbsp;the power between them to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.38. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר חלב זבחימו יאכלו</span><span class="font5">, “who did eat the fat of their&nbsp;sacrifices;” the sacrifices offered by the gentile nations to&nbsp;their respective deities. The fact is that the gentiles&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">themselves</span><span class="font5"> consume the “offerings” they present to their&nbsp;inert deities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יקומו ויעזרכם, </span><span class="font5">“let them arise now and help you!” The Israelites will say this about the deities of the gentiles when&nbsp;the time for their own salvation has come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ראו עתה כי אני אני הוא</span><span class="font5">, “See now that I, even I am&nbsp;He;” thus says the Lord to the nations that had enslave&nbsp;Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי אני אני הוא</span><span class="font5">, “I am the One Who will not change, always remain the same;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אני אמית ואחיה</span><span class="font5">, “I kill and I resurrect;” about Him it has been said: ובלע המות לנצח</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">He will do away with death&nbsp;forever;” (Isaiah 25,8) now the time has come that I will bring&nbsp;to life</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מחצתי</span><span class="font5">, “I have wounded;” a reference to what He did to the Israelites in the not too distant past;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואני ארפה</span><span class="font5">, “and I heal;” from now on I will heal them to remain well permanently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,40 כי אשא אל שמים ידי</span><span class="font5">, “for I lift up my hand to heaven;” as do human beings in order to ensure that the&nbsp;people present will listen to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.41. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ותאחז ידי</span><span class="font5">, and My hand will hold on to judgment;”&nbsp;holding on to the sword with one’s hand, in order to&nbsp;administer justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.42. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשכיר חצי מדם</span><span class="font5">, “I will make My arrows drunk with&nbsp;blood.” Concerning this we read in Ezekiel 21,12: הנה באה&nbsp;ונהיתה נאם ה', “Behold!, it comes and has happened.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשכיר חצי מדם</span><span class="font5">, “how is it possible for arrows to become drunk with blood? The meaning is that G’d will make others&nbsp;drunk when they see what His arrows have accomplished.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וחרבי תאכל בשר</span><span class="font5">, “and My sword shall devour flesh.” How is it possible for a sword to devour flesh? It means that G’d&nbsp;will arrange for others to be fed with meat as a result of what&nbsp;My sword has accomplished. This can be compared to what&nbsp;Ezekiel wrote in Ezekiel 39,17: בן אדם אמור לצפור כל כנף ולכל&nbsp;חית השדה האספו מסביב על זבחי, “Now you, Ben Adam, says My&nbsp;Lord, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hashem,</span><span class="font5"> say to every winged bird and to the beasts in&nbsp;the field: ‘gather around Me, and take part in My feast,’ etc.”&nbsp;Our author quotes several more verses from Scripture&nbsp;containing a similar message; (Ezekiel 39,18, 39,19,&nbsp;including the use of the word “becoming drunk.”) This is the&nbsp;interpretation given by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מדם חלל ושביה</span><span class="font5">, “from the blood of the slain and the captives (wounded?)” from what My arrows have done to the&nbsp;slain and the wounded of My people</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מראש פרעות אויב</span><span class="font5">, “from the long-haired head of the enemy.” This verse has been truncated; it should read:&nbsp;מפרעות ראש אויב, “from the long haired enemy chiefs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rabbi Nechemyah interprets the whole sequence commencing with verse 27: דינו רמה וגו' פן יאמרו, completely&nbsp;differently, understanding it as being addressed to the&nbsp;nations of the world</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,28 כי גוי אובד עצות המה</span><span class="font5">, “for any of the gentile nations are each a nation completely deprived of counsel, seeing&nbsp;that they do not even observe the seven basic laws given by&nbsp;the Lord to all of mankind, and they do not practice them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לו חכמו, </span><span class="font5">“had they possessed any wisdom;” if&nbsp;they had possessed any wisdom they would have&nbsp;understood that if one man could have put a thousand of the&nbsp;enemy to flight, this could never have been possible by&nbsp;natural means, but only because this one man had been&nbsp;supported by a superior heavenly force, i.e. the G’d Who had&nbsp;taken the Jewish people out of Egypt. Similarly, if now one of&nbsp;their enemies could frighten a thousand of them, this could&nbsp;also only have been possible because their G’d had&nbsp;abandoned them at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יבינו לאחריתם</span><span class="font5">, they would have realised that something similar or worse would happen to them for having enslaved&nbsp;the Jewish people, G’d’s people, as we know from verse 35&nbsp;וחש עתידות למו, “this will come to pass speedily.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.30. אם לא כי צורם מכרם</span><span class="font5">, “unless their Rock had sold them.” This is the only reason why a single gentile had been&nbsp;able to put a thousand of them to flight. All of this the gentile&nbsp;nations should have understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי לא כצורנו צורם</span><span class="font5">, “for their Rock is not like our&nbsp;rock, i.e. weak.” This is also why our enemies the Jewish&nbsp;people, in the past had been able to lord it over us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.32. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי מגפן סדום גפנם</span><span class="font5">, “why did their Rock sell them?&nbsp;Because they acted as if their origin had been the vines of&nbsp;Sodom, and because they behaved at if they had been&nbsp;planted in Amorah. We have proof of this from the writings of&nbsp;Isaiah 3,9: “they avow their sins like Sodom and they do not&nbsp;conceal them.” None of them are good, they have all become&nbsp;confirmed sinners, but for the longest time due to their G’d’s&nbsp;patience he had not demanded an accounting from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,34. הלא הוא כמוס עמדי</span><span class="font5">, “what the gentile nations have been saying about them, i.e. that they originated in Sodom&nbsp;and Amorah, is quite untrue; in fact I, the Lord have planted&nbsp;them as a noble plant.” (Jeremiah 2,21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.35. לי נקם ושלם</span><span class="font5">, “vengeance is Mine and the right to&nbsp;pay back the gentile nations;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעת תמוט רגלם</span><span class="font5">, “at the time when their feet shall slip.” (that of the gentile nations)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי קרוב ים אידם</span><span class="font5">, “for the day of their calamity is near.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;כי ידין</span><span class="font5">, “for He will judge (those nations);”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי יראה</span><span class="font5">, “when He sees;” Why will He choose that time</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to exact vengeance? because these nations had taken advantage of the Jewish people when these had been at a&nbsp;point in their fortunes. The gentile nations had called out with&nbsp;glee: “where is their famous G’d now?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.38. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר חלב זבחימו יאכלו, “</span><span class="font5">the G’d of Israel will&nbsp;consume the fate of its offerings;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יקומו ויעזרכם</span><span class="font5">, “may they (these deities) arise and help you.” Seeing that the gentiles have blasphemed in such a&nbsp;manner the G’d of Israel will duly punish them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ראו עתה כי אני הוא</span><span class="font5">, the reader is referred to the&nbsp;author’s commentary on this verse on page 1213.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ואין מידי מציל</span><span class="font5">, “and no one can save them from My hand.” This is G’d’s reply to the sarcastic words of the&nbsp;gentiles in verse 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,43. הרנינו גוים עמו </span><span class="font5">“sing aloud o you nations!” this is not a song of joy but a lament, similar to what we read in&nbsp;Lamentations 2,19: קומי רני בלילה, “arise cry out in the night!”&nbsp;These words are addressed to the nations which have&nbsp;enslaved the Jewish people. Why are these nations now to&nbsp;sing songs of mourning? Because G’d is avenging the&nbsp;innocent blood of Jews that has been spilled by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation of the words הרניו, etc.; “sing a song of praise nations, before the Lord!” Who are the&nbsp;“nations” that are supposed to sing this song of praise? The&nbsp;Israelites His people, seeing that He has avenged their&nbsp;blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A third interpretation of this line: all the nations are urged to sing of praise of G’d’s people, the Jewish people.&nbsp;He has avenged their oppressors, i.e. the blood of His&nbsp;servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וכפר</span><span class="font5">, “and make expiation;” the word is used as one indicating pacification, appeasement. Compare Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">32,21, when Yaakov sends costly gifts to his brother Esau in&nbsp;order to make him forget that he had once taken his blessing&nbsp;The word by which he described this was אכפרה פניו</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">I wish&nbsp;to appease him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אדמתו עמו, </span><span class="font5">“for the land of His people.” In classical Hebrew we find words where the letter ו is missing at the&nbsp;beginning of the word, such as Leviticus 21,14 וחללה זונה&nbsp;where we would have expected a connective letter ו at the&nbsp;beginning of the word זונה. Another example of that letter&nbsp;being missing is found in Chabakuk 3,11: ,שמש ירח עמד זבולה,&nbsp;“sun (and) moon stand still on high,” where the connective&nbsp;letter ו is missing before the word ירח, “moon.” In our verse&nbsp;also the letter ו is missing at the beginning of the word עמו,&nbsp;His people. G’d wishes to appease the earth of the Holy&nbsp;Land for having burdened it with absorbing blood shed of&nbsp;innocent Jews, by taking His revenge from the antisemites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,44. ויבא משה וידבר, “</span><span class="font5">Moses came and spoke, etc.” this is a reference to what we read in Deut: 31,30: “Moses&nbsp;spoke in the ears of the people, etc.;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הוא והושע בן נון</span><span class="font5">, “he and Joshua son of Nun;” They had both been commanded by G’d in chapter 31,14: “present&nbsp;yourselves in the Tent of Meeting and I will issue a&nbsp;command.” There is also another occasion when G’d&nbsp;commands Moses and Joshua </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">simultaneously,</span><span class="font5"> to write down&nbsp;Moses’ parting song/poem for the people (in verse 19&nbsp;chapter 31.) It is the custom of kings to instruct their servants&nbsp;in this manner Compare Joseph in Genesis 41,45, or Daniel&nbsp;and Chananiah, Mishael, and Azaryah being commanded by&nbsp;the king to change their Hebrew names (Daniel1,7).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this instance, now that Joshua has become the King of the Israelites, he is addressed again by his </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">original</span><span class="font5"> name&nbsp;of Hosea. Nonetheless, seeing the people had been used to&nbsp;his name Joshua already, this name is used in Scripture in&nbsp;most instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32,47. כי לא דבר רק הוא מכם</span><span class="font5">, “for it is no vain thing for you;” You will not perform all these commandments without&nbsp;compensation. If you do not study the Torah you will not</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">know when you transgress its laws and will die on account of not having studied them. (A reference to actively&nbsp;transgressing negative commandments) By the same token&nbsp;you will not know which commandments to fulfill in order to&nbsp;qualify for the rewards in store for you, and you will miss out&nbsp;on that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.48. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בעצם היום הזה</span><span class="font5">, “on this very day,” when he&nbsp;composed the song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">32.49. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;אשר על פני יריחו</span><span class="font5">, “facing Jericho, with only the river&nbsp;Jordan intervening in between.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parshat Vezot ha’brachah</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,1. וזאת הברכה, “</span><span class="font5">and this was the blessing, etc.” the letter ו at the beginning of the word וזאת, indicates that the&nbsp;paragraph following is a continuation of what we have read&nbsp;immediately before. Whereas up to now Moses had&nbsp;admonished the people, he now switched to blessing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,12. ה' מסיני בא</span><span class="font5">, “The Lord had come from Sinai;” some commentators understand this phrase as meaning:&nbsp;“the Lord, Whose glorious presence, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">shechinah,</span><span class="font5"> emanates&nbsp;fro Sinai, etc;” we find an example of such a construction in&nbsp;Psalms 134,3: יברכך ה׳ מסיני, “may the Lord Whose glorious&nbsp;presence emanates from Sinai, bless you;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וזרח משעיר למו</span><span class="font5">, “and He shone forth from Seir, to them;” the sunrise is witnessed each morning from the East of the&nbsp;land of Israel, the sun breaking forth from behind the&nbsp;mountains of Seir. It appears as if lightning suddenly&nbsp;illuminated the earth. [According to our author, these&nbsp;mountains are situated to the east of Mount Sinai. On our&nbsp;maps this is not quite so, as these mountains are more&nbsp;northern than easterly from Mount Sinai. Ed. ]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הופיע מהר פארן</span><span class="font5">, “He manifested Himself from the mountain of Paran. [This mountain is also assumed to be&nbsp;situated to the east of Mount Sinai. Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The concept of G’d making His appearance from an easterly direction of the universe is seen as a tribute to the&nbsp;people of Israel, meaning that the Lord came forward toward&nbsp;them. According to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> on Numbers 34,3, on the words:&nbsp;ממדבר צין, where he elaborates in an unusually lengthy&nbsp;manner on the geography of that region, this is to be&nbsp;understood as a sign of His fondness of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מימינו אש דת למו</span><span class="font5">, “at His right hand was a fiery law unto them.” That the right side is one which symbolises fondness&nbsp;we know from Song of Songs 2,6: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וימינו תחבקני</span><span class="font5">, “and His right&nbsp;hand embraces me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשדת</span><span class="font5">, spelled in the text as a single word, but read as if it had been written: אש דת.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,3. אף חובב עמי</span><span class="font5">ם, “Lover, indeed of the peoples;” (the twelve tribes of Israel are termed “peoples). We know that&nbsp;the Israelites were viewed as “special” by G’d when He said&nbsp;to us in Exodus 19,5: והייתם לי סגולה, “you will be for Me a&nbsp;treasure;” Why is this so? It is because all of His holy beings&nbsp;are under His direct supervision. How does this work in&nbsp;practice? “והם תוכו לרגליו, “they are sitting between His feet;”&nbsp;Compare Exodus 19,17: ויתיצבו בתחתית ההר, “they had taken&nbsp;up their positions at the base of the Mountain.” (Sinai).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: even at times when G’d is fond of the gentile nations and delivers the sinful Israelites&nbsp;into their hands, they still remain under His direct&nbsp;supervision, (though they may not be aware of it.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והם</span><span class="font5">, “and they are;” Israel, תוכו לרגלך; after all when the gentiles persecute them it is only </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">because</span><span class="font5"> they are G’d’s&nbsp;people, having entered into a covenant with Him to observe&nbsp;His commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">לרגלך, this expression, presuming that G’d has physical dimensions, is also used in Genesis 30,30 where even the&nbsp;pagan Lavan acknowledges the existence and personal&nbsp;providence of Yaakov by his G’d when he enriched Lavan in&nbsp;order that the latter treat Yaakov fairly. This is why Yaakov&nbsp;could say to him there: ‘ויברך ה׳ אותך </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">לרגלי</span><span class="font5">, “He has blessed&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">you</span><span class="font5"> at my foot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of the words: והם תוכו לרגלך, “in the Holy Temple.” The Temple is perceived as G’d’s footstool&nbsp;on earth. His presence manifests itself in and around the&nbsp;Temple. This is where most Israelites are found three times a&nbsp;year at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ישא מדברותיך</span><span class="font5">, “receiving part of Your words.” This was a reference to the first two of the Ten Commandments during&nbsp;the revelation at Mount Sinai which the whole people heard&nbsp;directly from the mouth of G’d before having asked Moses to&nbsp;become their interpreter. (Deuteronomy, 5,21-26)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,4. תורה צוה לנו משה</span><span class="font5">, “Moses commanded the Torah to us;” whereas G’d had commanded them the first two&nbsp;commandments, Moses commanded them the remaining&nbsp;611 commandments. (This is why the numerical value of the&nbsp;letters in the word תורה total 611) In spite of the extraordinary&nbsp;spiritual high level the whole people had attained at that time,&nbsp;i.e. they were able to “see” thunder not just hear it, they could&nbsp;not listen to the voice of the Lord any longer and had feared&nbsp;they would die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'תורה צוה לנו משה וגו</span><span class="font5">, this verse appears in a truncated mode and should by rights read: תורה צוה לנו משה להיותה מורשה&nbsp;לנו קהלת יעקב, ”Moses commanded us this Torah in order for it&nbsp;to become a heritage to the congregation of Yaakov.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויהי, </span><span class="font5">“he became,” i.e. Moses;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בישורון מלך בהתאסף ראשי עם</span><span class="font5">, “King in Yeshurun, when the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">leaders of the people assembled.” This was recorded in Deuteronomy 4,10: באמור ה' אלי הקהל את העם ואשמיעם את דברי,&nbsp;when the Lord said to me: “assemble the people so that I can&nbsp;let them hear My words.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is up to us to keep the Torah which He commanded us, and after having accepted it, it became a source of&nbsp;blessing for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יחי ראובן ואל ימות</span><span class="font5">, “may Reuven live and not die;”&nbsp;Moses refers to the period when the members of that tribe&nbsp;would be in the vanguard of crossing the Jordan and battling&nbsp;the Canaanites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויהי מתיו מספר</span><span class="font5">, “let the number of his men of military age that had been counted not decline.” (Let them not suffer&nbsp;casualties)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וזאת ליהודה</span><span class="font5">, “and this for Yehudah;” he meant that&nbsp;his blessing that Reuven should not suffer casualties in&nbsp;battle, should also apply to the men of military age of the&nbsp;tribe of Yehudah;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this point </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> said (based on the Talmud tractate Sotah folio 7) that Moses gave the credit for Reuven’s having&nbsp;done penitence to how Yehudah had demeaned himself&nbsp;publicly when admitting that his daughter-in-law had become&nbsp;pregnant by him. (Genesis 38,26) In Genesis 37,29, we read&nbsp;about Reuven being mortified when Joseph was no longer in&nbsp;the pit the brothers had thrown him into. Although he had not&nbsp;even been present when Joseph was sold, he held himself&nbsp;responsible for not staying around at that time. Yehudah,&nbsp;though admitting his paternity of his daughter-in-law’s&nbsp;Tamar’s babies did not do so until challenged. Until Yehudah&nbsp;admitted his guilt publicly, Reuven had done so only&nbsp;privately; (Genesis 37,29). After hearing of Yehudah’s&nbsp;confession, he too admitted his defiling his father’s couch&nbsp;openly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">שמע ה׳ קול יהודה</span><span class="font5">, “hear o Lord the voice of Yehudah!” Whenever Yehudah finds himself in difficulties and appeals&nbsp;to You for help on behalf of his people, grant his plea! He is&nbsp;singled out for this as he normally leads the rest of the tribes&nbsp;in warfare. (Compare Judges 1,2) The same applied to&nbsp;Reuven, as he had been the first tribe to cross the Jordan&nbsp;and face the enemy. Compare Joshua 6,7.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shimon did not </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">need</span><span class="font5"> to be mentioned separately as that tribe always made common cause with Yehudah as reported&nbsp;in the Book of Judges. [His territory was an enclave within&nbsp;the territory of Yehudah. Ed.] (Compare Judges 1,3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different interpretation of Moses’s pleading: יחי ראובן, “may Reuven live!” Seeing that the founding father of the&nbsp;tribe of Reuven had committed a serious offense against his&nbsp;father Yaakov, and the commandment of honouring father&nbsp;and mother is accompanied by the promise that people doing&nbsp;so would enjoy long life, (Exodus 20,12) it could be inferred&nbsp;that people failing to do so would have their lives cut short,&nbsp;Moses blesses the tribe, emphasising that the descendants&nbsp;of Reuven should not be affected by something their&nbsp;founding father had done wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וזאת ליהודה</span><span class="font5">, “the following is the blessing for Yehudah, as distinct from </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">praise</span><span class="font5"> for its founding father. Its founding&nbsp;father had also caused his father grief due to Joseph’s&nbsp;having been sold at the time was due to his suggestion.&nbsp;(Genesis 37,27)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses was not willing to mention the name of the tribe of Shimon as Moses held him responsible in his heart for&nbsp;being the one who had first suggested that Joseph be killed.&nbsp;(Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi’s</span><span class="font5"> commentary on Genesis 42,24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,8. וללוי אמר וגו</span><span class="font5">׳, “and of Levi he said, etc.” Moses referred to the Levite (singular) who had been chosen to&nbsp;wear the breastplate with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Urim</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tumim,</span><span class="font5"> (the High&nbsp;Priest of the people) evidence that he was considered a&nbsp;pious individual, and whom G’d had put to a test repeatedly,&nbsp;although he had failed a test by the Lord at Massah/</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Merivah,&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">he had nevertheless qualified to become so holy that he was&nbsp;not allowed to defile himself even if it had been to bury his&nbsp;father or mother. [The High Priest in any generation is not&nbsp;allowed to cause himself to become ritually defiled except&nbsp;when a corpse has no one else who could bury him without&nbsp;delay; Leviticus 21,11) Ed.], כי שמרו אמרתיך, “for the Levites&nbsp;observed Your commandments not to defile the sanctity of&nbsp;the Tabernacle/Temple.” (Leviticus 21,12) None of the&nbsp;Levites committed the error of worshipping the golden calf,&nbsp;and they were prepared to execute family members whom&nbsp;they found doing so. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Sifri</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובריתך ינצורו</span><span class="font5">, “and they kept Your covenant.” The covenant G’d made with the priests whose status became&nbsp;hereditary from father to son. (Numbers 25,13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יורו משפטיך ליעקב</span><span class="font5">, “They will teach Your&nbsp;ordinances to Yaakov;” seeing that they are impartial people&nbsp;not showing undue favours to anyone, they are qualified to&nbsp;teach and help enforce Your laws. (Compare Ezekiel 44,23:&nbsp;ואת עמי יורו,”and My people they will instruct.) It is also written&nbsp;in Deut: 17,9: ובאת אל הכהנים הלוים והגידו לך את דבר המשפט,&nbsp;“when you will come to the priests, who are members of the&nbsp;tribe of the Levites, and they will tell you matters concerning&nbsp;the ordinances.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: “they will teach you the laws of the Torah, since they do not have to earn their living from&nbsp;farming, etc., they have the time to study and teach all these&nbsp;laws.” The reason they did not receive any share of the land&nbsp;of Israel was to enable them to do just that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ופועל ידיו תרצה</span><span class="font5">, “and may the work of his hands&nbsp;be welcomed by You;” the “work” Moses speaks of are the&nbsp;sacrifices of the priests who are members of this tribe. The&nbsp;expression נרצה is especially appropriate for the expiation for&nbsp;sins most sacrifices are meant to achieve. If anyone who is&nbsp;not a member of that tribe, i.e. a priest, offers such sacrifices&nbsp;they will not achieve this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">מן יקומון</span><span class="font5">, “from anyone rising up against the Israelites.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לבנימין אמר, </span><span class="font5">“to Binyamin he had said: Binyamin is&nbsp;m entioned by Moses im mediately after the tribe of Levi,&nbsp;seeing that the major part of the Temple building was&nbsp;situated on its ancestral land, and the Levites and priests&nbsp;therefore were moving on that soil when they performed their&nbsp;priestly duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'ידיד ה</span><span class="font5">, “the beloved one of the Lord;” he is called the beloved one because </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ישכון לבטח עליו</span><span class="font5">, “seeing that the&nbsp;protective Presence of the Lord which resides in the Temple&nbsp;is constantly manifest on his ancestral land.” The term: עליו,&nbsp;in the sense of “by Him,” is also found in Numbers 2,20, ועליו&nbsp;מנשה, where it describes the location of the tribe of Menashe&nbsp;as next to Ephrayim, both parts of the tribe of Joseph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">חופף עליו כל היום</span><span class="font5">, “G’d’s manifestation covers him (Binyamin) all day long;” it saves him from potential&nbsp;attackers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ובין כתפיו </span><span class="font5">שכן, ”and He dwells between his shoulders.” The word כתף</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, “</span><span class="font5">shoulder,” is used by Moses as a metaphor,&nbsp;similar to Numbers 34,11, where it describes the slopes&nbsp;leading to the sea of Galilee as “shoulder.” The reason why&nbsp;this tribe received such a complimentary title is that its&nbsp;founding father was the only son of Yaakov who had not&nbsp;been involved in the sale of their brother Joseph. This is why&nbsp;G’d’s Presence could feel so at home on its territory that the&nbsp;Temple was located on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וליוסף אמר מבורכת ה' ארצו</span><span class="font5">, “and of Joseph he said:&nbsp;“blessed by the Lord be his land;” When Adam, the first&nbsp;human being, had sinned by allowing himself to be seduced&nbsp;by his wife, the land on which he lived afterwards was cursed&nbsp;as a result, and his livelihood became one that required hard&nbsp;toil. Joseph, who had withstood the deduction by the wife of&nbsp;Potiphar, was rewarded (his tribe) in that the land his&nbsp;descendants dwelled on was especially blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וממגד גרש </span><span class="font5">ירחים, “and from the precious things due&nbsp;to the moons.” The fruit of the trees emanate from the earth,&nbsp;and the trees start growing at the beginning of the month. On&nbsp;each new moon a different category of fruit tree commences&nbsp;the cycle of growing and subsequently ripening. Our author&nbsp;quotes four examples of this as an illustration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ומראש הררי קדם</span><span class="font5">; “and from the top of the ancient&nbsp;mountains.” This is an expression of praise, as for instance in&nbsp;Jeremiah 2,3: ראשית תבואתה, “the first fruit of its harvest, or</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Amos 6,6: וראשית שמנים, “with the choicest oils.” Moses refers to the choicest mountains that were created during the first&nbsp;six days of creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הררי קדם</span><span class="font5">, the mountains of Ephrayim; the land allocated to the tribe of Joseph’s descendant Ephrayim, son of Joseph&nbsp;was especially mountainous. Compare Samuel I 1,1, צופים&nbsp;מהר אפרים, “from the district of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tzofim</span><span class="font5"> in the mountains of&nbsp;Ephrayim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ורצון שוכני סנה</span><span class="font5">, “and the goodwill of Him that&nbsp;dwells in the bush. May it enjoy the good will of Him (G’d)&nbsp;that dwells in the (burning) bush.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">נזיר אחיו</span><span class="font5">, (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi)</span><span class="font5"> ‘the one who had been separated from his brothers.” According to other&nbsp;commentators this ought to be translated as: “the prince&nbsp;among his brothers.” Use of the expression נזיר as meaning&nbsp;“prince” is found in Lamentations 4,7: זכו נזירה משלג, “her&nbsp;princes were purer than snow.” Joseph had clearly been at&nbsp;least a prince among his brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;בכור שורו</span><span class="font5">, “His firstling bullock;” Joshua was the&nbsp;first king chosen by G’d from the descendants of Joseph.&nbsp;This is why he is referred to by Moses here as בכור,&nbsp;“firstborn.” The reason why Moses compares a king to an ox&nbsp;is because the ox or bullock is the king amongst the&nbsp;domesticated four legged mammals. (Talmud tractate&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chagigah</span><span class="font5"> folio 13.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והם רבבות אפרים</span><span class="font5">, “and they (the horns) are tens of thousands of the warriors of Ephrayim.” Seeing that Joshua&nbsp;was from the tribe of Ephrayim, the soldiers of that tribe&nbsp;would be the first to rally around him when war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">והם אלפי מנשה</span><span class="font5">, the Israelites had a great leader from the tribe of Menashe also, by the name of Gideon, who was&nbsp;known for fighting with far fewer soldiers, i.e.,אלפי מנשה, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">thousands</span><span class="font5"> of Menashe. Yaakov when on his deathbed, had&nbsp;insisted on placing his right hand on Ephrayim, the younger&nbsp;of the two brothers. This is reflected in Moses’ blessing here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שמח זבולון</span><span class="font5">, “rejoice Zevulun;” he had complained&nbsp;about the portions of ancestral land he had drawn in the&nbsp;Talmud tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Megillah,</span><span class="font5"> folio 6 as having received&nbsp;mountainous territory and sandy territory alongside the&nbsp;ocean, compared to Naftaly who had been given apparently&nbsp;fruitful earth in the mountainous regions, as had most other&nbsp;tribes. Deborah praised this tribe in her victory song in&nbsp;Judges 5,18 as literally having mocked death in the constant&nbsp;danger as a seafaring tribe. When Zevulun had seen Naftaly&nbsp;completely exposed, as the other tribes simply failed to&nbsp;respond to Deborah’s call to arms, he responded without&nbsp;hesitation. Foreseeing all this in a prophetic vision, Moses is&nbsp;trying to calm Zevulun for having received his share near the&nbsp;beaches of the ocean where they would be far less exposed&nbsp;than Naftaly; would he have preferred to have been exposed&nbsp;to the dangers Naftaly faced? It will be explained soon how&nbsp;Zevulun in fact benefited by his territory facing the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בצאתך</span><span class="font5">, “when you are setting out;” Moses blesses each tribe according to what he foresees will be its special needs.&nbsp;Zevulun as a seafarer, who derives his livelihood from&nbsp;maritime trade, will require a special blessing to keep his&nbsp;ships safe when they are on the high seas, so that his&nbsp;merchandise will not be lost at sea. Compare Yaakov’s&nbsp;blessing for him in Genesis 49,13, where reference is made&nbsp;to the beaches of the sea in connection with him. Moses&nbsp;blesses him in wishing him that instead of being fearful when&nbsp;setting out on each voyage, he should be joyful, confident of&nbsp;G’d’s help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויששכר באהליך</span><span class="font5">, whereas he blesses Yissochor by wishing him similar confidence seeing that his fertile soil may become&nbsp;the envy of his neighbours, so that he is forced to stand&nbsp;guard watching against potential robbers. Moses wishes him&nbsp;success in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yaakov had already hinted at this in his blessing for this son when he said in Genesis 49,14: רובץ בין המשפתים</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;“</span><span class="font5">crouching among the sheepfolds</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,19. ושפני טמוני חול</span><span class="font5">, “and the hidden treasures of the sand.” Sometimes when ships break up when at harbour and&nbsp;are buried deep in the sand; when the waters of the sea&nbsp;retreat, it is revealed that this sand which buried their ships&nbsp;had also hidden treasures which would have remained&nbsp;undiscovered if the ship had not broken up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;מרחיב גד</span><span class="font5">, “Who enlarges Gad; Moses blesses him&nbsp;to whom G’d had given a large territory, suitable for raising&nbsp;sheep and cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">וטרף זרוע אף קדקוד</span><span class="font5">, “to tear off arm and scalp;” seeing that the scalp is mentioned last, it is clear that he disabled his&nbsp;opponent first by disabling his arm which carries his weapon.&nbsp;He does so by taking aim at the sword raised against him. By&nbsp;doing so he succeeds in not only disabling his opponent’s&nbsp;arm but decapitating him at the same time with one stroke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;וירא ראשית לו</span><span class="font5">, “he chose a first part for himself.”&nbsp;Even though the Ammonites and Moabites dispute his&nbsp;territorial claims to its land, as is evident from Judges 11,13&nbsp;and Yiftach rebutting their arguments. (Compare </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi</span><span class="font5"> there)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another interpretation of this line: What is the meaning of the phrase: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">כי שם חלקת מחוקק צפון</span><span class="font5">, “for in part of that land&nbsp;the grave of the Israelites’ lawgiver (Moses would be&nbsp;hidden)&quot; Alternately, Reuven has been referred to as the&nbsp;lawgiver; in Judges 5,15, when Deborah describes him as&nbsp;such with the words: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">בפלגות ראובן גדולים חקקי לב</span><span class="font5">, “among the&nbsp;clans of Reuven who were debating great decisions of the&nbsp;heart.” The Reuvenites had long been entrenched in these&nbsp;lands already, (at the time of Yiftach, 300 years after Moses&nbsp;had died).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to yet another interpretation the whole line speaks about both Reuven </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">Gad, the two tribes who had&nbsp;decided to settle on the east bank of the Jordan river. Since&nbsp;both of these tribes had proven outstandingly strong, Moses&nbsp;accords them recognition already in his parting words to the&nbsp;people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;יזנק מן הבשן</span><span class="font5">, “he leaps forth from the region of&nbsp;Bashan.” He (Dan) conquers in that region, although it is well&nbsp;known as the habitat of lions and other ferocious beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;שבע רצון</span><span class="font5">, Naftaly is satisfied, aware of having&nbsp;been favoured;” the fruit of his orchards is not only of the&nbsp;highest quality, but also ripens ahead of those in other&nbsp;regions of the land. Whenever he tastes them he is gratefully&nbsp;conscious of his good fortune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'ומלא ברכת ה</span><span class="font5">, “and filled with G’d’s blessing.” Whoever visits his part the land of Israel is amazed at how blessed this&nbsp;tribe is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ברך מבני</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר</span><span class="font5">, “Asher be blessed more than the&nbsp;other sons (of Yaakov). He receives these blessings from the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">other</span><span class="font5"> tribes, as proved from the end of this verse, where&nbsp;Moses concludes with יהי רצוי אחיו, “let him be the most&nbsp;favoured among his brothers.” What is the reason why all the&nbsp;other tribes bless Asher? He is able to bathe his feet in oil,&nbsp;i.e. this tribe enjoys an abundance of oil harvested from the&nbsp;olive trees on his territory. All its members can anoint&nbsp;themselves with this oil at minimal cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ברוך מבני</span><span class="font5">ם </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר, </span><span class="font5">according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rashi,</span><span class="font5"> the interpretation of this line is that there is no other tribe that has enjoyed being&nbsp;as fruitful, having so many children. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rashi</span><span class="font5"> quotes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sifri</span><span class="font5"> as his&nbsp;source, adding that he does not know the reason for this.) If&nbsp;we consider the numbers of the tribes’ male children&nbsp;provided by the Torah, Menashe appears to have been&nbsp;equally blessed if not more so. The latter, of course was not&nbsp;a son but a grandson of Yaakov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">יהי רצוי אחיו</span><span class="font5">, according to tradition, when Reuven had defiled the couch of his father, it was Asher who told his&nbsp;other brothers about this. When hearing this, the brothers&nbsp;chided him for badmouthing their oldest brother. They&nbsp;ostracised him forthwith. Moses now revoked this ostracism.&nbsp;Seeing that when someone is ostracised this is introduced by&nbsp;the word: “be cursed,” Moses reversed this by now&nbsp;introducing his blessing of this tribe with an additional word of&nbsp;blessing, i.e. ברוך. When someone has been officially&nbsp;ostracised he is not allowed to engage in marital intercourse.&nbsp;He is also not allowed to anoint his skin with oil, nor to wear&nbsp;normal shoes; hence Moses refers to this tribe’s feet being&nbsp;shod with exceptionally string shoes, i.e. his shoes are as&nbsp;strong as iron. [According to Rabbi Chavell, this&nbsp;interpretation is found in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tossaphot.</span><span class="font5"> Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.25. ברזל ונחושת מנעליך</span><span class="font5">, “may your bars (locks) be constructed of iron or copper;” poor people cannot afford to&nbsp;construct the bars to their doors of metal but have to use&nbsp;wood. Moses blesses Asher that it will be wealthy enough to&nbsp;construct these bars of either iron or copper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33,25. דבאך</span><span class="font5">, “your old age.” The expression is one of&nbsp;דאבה, “old age;” it is one of the words in which the sequence&nbsp;of two letters have been reversed, such as in כשבים and כשבים&nbsp;sheep, or שמלה and שלמה, both meaning: dress, or garment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moses refers to the days of old age which often are days of anxiety and depression, i.e. דאבה. Moses blesses&nbsp;Asher in that even in his old age he would be full of vigour&nbsp;and enjoy the golden age. Compare a statement to this effect&nbsp;in the Talmud, tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chulin,</span><span class="font5"> folio 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.27. ומתחת זרועות עולם</span><span class="font5">, “and underneath are the everlasting arms;” Asher is perceived riding on the globe&nbsp;which is seen as beneath the rider. The “arms” are seen as&nbsp;supporting the universe, carrying its weight. The One Who&nbsp;rules both the upper regions of the universe and its lower&nbsp;regions is seen as supporting Asher also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ויגרש מפניך אויב</span><span class="font5">, “He thrusts out the enemy from before you. They are specifically: Amalek, Sichon and Og.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">,ויאמר: השמד, and Who said: “destroy,” i.e. תמחה את זכר </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עמלק </span><span class="font5">“wipe out the memory of Amalek</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">” (</span><span class="font5">Deut 25</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">,</span><span class="font5">19</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font5">and לא&nbsp;תחיה כל נשמה “do not allow a single soul to survive” (in the&nbsp;land of Canaan).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עין יעקב</span><span class="font5">, “the fountain of Yaakov;” a metaphor for&nbsp;the descendants of Yaakov, as in Isaiah 48,1: וממי יהודה יצאו,&nbsp;“and who came forth from the waters of Yehudah.” (metaphor&nbsp;for “from the loins of”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">33.29</span><span class="font5">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויכחשו </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אויביך לך, </span><span class="font5">“and when your enemies will try&nbsp;to deceive you, etc.;” your enemies will sometimes pretend to&nbsp;be your friends in order to lull you into a sense of security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,1 ויעל משה</span><span class="font5">, “Moses ascended;” G’d had told him to ascend Mount Nebo already in Numbers ,27,12; at that time&nbsp;the Mountain was called: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הר העברים</span><span class="font5">. Nonetheless, Moses had&nbsp;waited with doing this until he had blessed his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הר נבו</span><span class="font5">, “Mount Nebo.” This mountain is identical with the one called: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">הר העברים </span><span class="font5">in Numbers chapter 27. The name in&nbsp;this verse appears to relate to the summit of that range of&nbsp;mountains which was situated on the territory of Reuven, as&nbsp;pointed out in Numbers 32,37 where the members of the&nbsp;tribe of Reuven are described as having built Nebo, etc.;&nbsp;when it is written concerning the territory of the tribe of Gad:&nbsp;“for that is where the grave of the lawgiver is situated,” (Deut.&nbsp;33,21) it appears that this must have been at the boundary&nbsp;between the territories of Reuven and Gad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את כל הארץ</span><span class="font5">, “the whole land;” Moses saw the entire land of Canaan with his physical eyes, more than what Joshua&nbsp;would step on with his feet during his wars of conquest.&nbsp;(Joshua 18, 2-10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">את הגלעד, </span><span class="font5">“the region known as Gilead;” Moses at the time when looking at the West Bank of the river Jordan was&nbsp;standing in that region, looking as far north as Dan, the&nbsp;northern boundary of the land of Israel. (Compare what is&nbsp;written in Samuel I 3,20, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עד הים האחרון</span><span class="font5">, “as far as the western boundary of&nbsp;the land of Israel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;עיר התמרים, </span><span class="font5">“the city of date palms;” so called as it&nbsp;was exceptionally excellent as mentioned specifically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.6</span><span class="font5">.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ויקבר אותו בגיא</span><span class="font5">, “He was buried in the valley;” we&nbsp;have been given three points as to where Moses grave was&nbsp;situated. A) in the valley; B) in which valley? “in the land of&nbsp;Moav;” C) at what location? opposite Beyt Peor. Even after&nbsp;having been given these three details still no one ever&nbsp;located the precise point where Moses is buried. (Talmud&nbsp;tractate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sotah</span><span class="font5"> folio 13) This proves that he was not buried by&nbsp;a human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">עד היום הזה, </span><span class="font5">“until this day.” The principal reason for this is to make it impossible for anyone to be buried next to him.&nbsp;This was in order to prevent necromancers from using this&nbsp;site for their purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;לא כהתה עינו</span><span class="font5">, “his eye had not become dim;” he&nbsp;had exuded light until the end of his days, as he had when he&nbsp;had returned to earth from Mount Sinai on the last occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,8. ויבכו בני ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “The Children of Israel wept, etc.” when Aaron had died the Torah describes “the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">whole</span><span class="font5"> house&nbsp;of Israel</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">” </span><span class="font5">as having mourned his passing.(Number 20,29)&nbsp;The reason for the difference was that at that time anyone&nbsp;seeing Moses cry at the death of his brother could not help&nbsp;crying also. When Moses died there was no one left of such&nbsp;a stature that it would cause him to cry also. Alternately, the&nbsp;women did not weep at Moses’ passing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,10. ולא קם נביא עוד בישראל כמשה</span><span class="font5">, “there never again arose in Israel a prophet of the stature of Moses;” the reason&nbsp;the word בישראל, “in Israel,” has been added here is to tell the&nbsp;reader that we do not need to be told that no such prophet&nbsp;arose amongst the gentiles, but that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">even</span><span class="font5"> among the&nbsp;Israelites there never arose a prophet to equal Moses in his&nbsp;stature. We had been given proof of this in Exodus 33,16,&nbsp;when the Torah wrote: נפלינו אני ועמך מכל העם אשר על פני האדמה,&nbsp;“and so that we are distinguished, I and Your people from all&nbsp;the people that are on the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">אשר ידעו ה' פנים אל פנים, </span><span class="font5">“who knew the Lord face to face.” This has been recorded in Numbers 12,8: פה אל פה&nbsp;אדבר בו ומראה לא בחידות ותמונת ה' יביט, “with him I speak mouth&nbsp;to mouth, even manifestly and not in dark speeches and he&nbsp;beholds a visual image of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An alternate interpretation: “G’d did know Moses face to face, but Moses did not know G’d face to face, for G’d&nbsp;Himself is on record as saying: כי לא יראני האדם וחי, “for no&nbsp;human being can see Me while he is still alive.” (Exodus&nbsp;33,20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34,12. ולכל המורא</span><span class="font5">, “and in all the awe-inspiring manifestations;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">לעיני כל ישראל</span><span class="font5">, “in the sight of all of Israel.”</span></p>
