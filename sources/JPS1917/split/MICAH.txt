MICAH 

 

The word of the LORD that came 
to Micah the Morashtite in the 
days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, 
kings of Judah, which he saw 
concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. 

 

2Hear, ye peoples, all of you; 

Hearken, O earth, and all that 
therein is; 

And let the Lord GOD be witness 
against you, 

The Lord from His holy temple. 

3For, behold, the LORD cometh forth 
out of His place, 

And will come down, and tread 
upon the high places of the earth. 

4And the mountains shall be molten 
under Him, 

And the valleys shall be cleft, 

As wax before the fire, 

As waters that are poured down a 
steep place. 

 

5For the transgression of Jacob is all 
this, 

And for the sins of the house of 
Israel. 

What is the transgression of Jacob? 
Is it not Samaria? 

And what are the high places of 
Judah? are they not Jerusalem? 

 

6Therefore I will make Samaria a 
heap in the field, 

A place for the planting of 
vineyards; 
1 




And I will pour down the stones 
thereof into the valley, 

And I will uncover the foundations 
thereof. 

7And all her graven images shall be 
beaten to pieces, 

And all her hires shall be burned 
with fire, 

And all her idols will I lay desolate; 

For of the hire of a harlot hath she 
gathered them, 

And unto the hire of a harlot shall 
they return. 

 

8For this will I wail and howl, 

I will go stripped and naked; 

I will make a wailing like the 
jackals, 

And a mourning like the ostriches. 

9For her wound is incurable; 

For it is come even unto Judah; 

It reacheth unto the gate of my 
people, even to Jerusalem. 

10Tell it not in Gath, 

Weep not at all; 

At Beth-le-aphrah roll thyself in the 
dust. 

11Pass ye away, O inhabitant of 
Saphir, in nakedness and shame; 

The inhabitant of Zaanan is not 
come forth; 

The wailing of Beth-ezel shall take 
from you the standing-place 
thereof. 

12For the inhabitant of Maroth 
waiteth anxiously for good; 

Because evil is come down from the 
LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem. 

13Bind the chariots to the swift 
steeds, O inhabitant of Lachish; 

She was the beginning of sin to the 
daughter of Zion; 

For the transgressions of Israel are 
found in thee. 

14Therefore shalt thou give a parting 
gift to Moresheth-gath; 

The houses of Achzib shall be a 
deceitful thing unto the kings of 
Israel. 

15I will yet bring unto thee, O 
inhabitant of Mareshah, him that 
shall possess thee; 

The glory of Israel shall come even 
unto Adullam. 

16Make thee bald, and poll thee for 
the children of thy delight; 

Enlarge thy baldness as the vulture; 

For they are gone into captivity 
from thee. 

 

Woe to them that devise iniquity 

And work evil upon their beds! 

When the morning is light, they 
execute it, 

Because it is in the power of their 
hand. 

2And they covet fields, and seize 
them; 

And houses, and take them away; 

Thus they oppress a man and his 
house, 

Even a man and his heritage. 

3Therefore thus saith the LORD: 

Behold, against this family do I 
devise an evil, 

From which ye shall not remove 
your necks, 
2 




Neither shall ye walk upright; for it 
shall be an evil time. 

4In that day shall they take up a 
parable against you, 

And lament with a doleful 
lamentation, and say: 

‘We are utterly ruined; 

He changeth the portion of my 
people; 

How doth he remove it from me! 

Instead of restoring our fields, he 
divideth them.’ 

5Therefore thou shalt have none that 
shall cast the line by lot 

In the congregation of the LORD. 

6’Preach ye not’, they preach; 

‘They shall not preach of these 
things, 

That they shall not take shame.’ 

7Do I change, O house of Jacob? 

Is the spirit of the LORD straitened? 

Are these His doings? 

Do not My words do good to him 
that walketh uprightly? 

 

8But of late My people is risen up as 
an enemy; 

With the garment ye strip also the 
mantle 

From them that pass by securely, so 
that they are as men returning 
from war. 

9The women of My people ye cast 
out from their pleasant houses; 

From their young children ye take 
away My glory for ever. 

10Arise ye, and depart; for this is not 
your resting-place; 

Because of the uncleanness thereof, 
it shall destroy you, even with a 
sore destruction. 

 

11If a man walking in wind and 
falsehood do lie: 

‘I will preach unto thee of wine and 
of strong drink’; 

He shall even be the preacher of this 
people. 

 

12I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all 
of thee; 

I will surely gather the remnant of 
Israel; 

I will render them all as sheep in a 
fold; 

As a flock in the midst of their 
pasture; 

They shall make great noise by 
reason of the multitude of men. 

13The breaker is gone up before 
them; 

They have broken forth and passed 
on, 

By the gate, and are gone out 
thereat; 

And their king is passed on before 
them, 

And the LORD at the head of them. 

 

And I said: 

Hear, I pray you, ye heads of 
Jacob, 

And rulers of the house of Israel: 

Is it not for you to know justice? 

2Who hate the good, and love the 
evil; 

Who rob their skin from off them, 
3 




And their flesh from off their bones; 

3Who also eat the flesh of my 
people, 

And flay their skin from off them, 

And break their bones; 

Yea, they chop them in pieces, as 
that which is in the pot, 

And as flesh within the caldron. 

4Then shall they cry unto the LORD, 

But He will not answer them; 

Yea, He will hide His face from 
them at that time, 

According as they have wrought 
evil in their doings. 

 

5Thus saith the LORD concerning the 
prophets that make my people to 
err; 

That cry: ‘Peace’, when their teeth 
have any thing to bite; 

And whoso putteth not into their 
mouths, 

They even prepare war against him: 

6Therefore it shall be night unto 
you, that ye shall have no vision; 

And it shall be dark unto you, that 
ye shall not divine; 

And the sun shall go down upon the 
prophets, 

And the day shall be black over 
them. 

7And the seers shall be put to shame, 
and the diviners confounded; 

Yea, they shall all cover their upper 
lips; 

For there shall be no answer of God. 

8But I truly am full of power by the 
spirit of the LORD, 

And of justice, and of might, to 
declare unto Jacob his 
transgression, 

And to Israel his sin. 

 

9Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of 
the house of Jacob, 

And rulers of the house of Israel, 

That abhor justice, and pervert all 
equity; 

10That build up Zion with blood, 

And Jerusalem with iniquity. 

11The heads thereof judge for 
reward, 

And the priests thereof teach for 
hire, 

And the prophets thereof divine for 
money; 

Yet will they lean upon the LORD, 
and say: 

‘Is not the LORD in the midst of us? 

No evil shall come upon us’? 

12Therefore shall Zion for your sake 
be plowed as a field, 

And Jerusalem shall become heaps, 

And the mountain of the house as 
the high places of a forest. 

 

But in the end of days it shall 
come to pass, 

That the mountain of the LORD’S 
house shall be established as the 
top of the mountains, 

And it shall be exalted above the 
hills; 

And peoples shall flow unto it. 

2And many nations shall go and say: 

‘Come ye, and let us go up to the 
mountain of the LORD, 
4 




And to the house of the God of 
Jacob; 

And He will teach us of His ways, 

And we will walk in His paths’; 

For out of Zion shall go forth the 
law, 

And the word of the LORD from 
Jerusalem. 

3And He shall judge between many 
peoples, 

And shall decide concerning mighty 
nations afar off; 

And they shall beat their swords into 
plowshares, 

And their spears into pruninghooks; 

Nation shall not lift up sword 
against nation, 

Neither shall they learn war any 
more. 

4But they shall sit every man under 
his vine and under his fig-tree; 

And none shall make them afraid; 

For the mouth of the LORD of hosts 
hath spoken. 

 

5For let all the peoples walk each 
one in the name of its god, 

But we will walk in the name of the 
LORD our God for ever and ever. 

 

6In that day, saith the LORD, will I 
assemble her that halteth, 

And I will gather her that is driven 
away, 

And her that I have afflicted; 

7And I will make her that halted a 
remnant, 

And her that was cast far off a 
mighty nation; 

And the LORD shall reign over them 
in mount Zion from thenceforth 
even for ever. 

 

8And thou, Migdal-eder, the hill of 
the daughter of Zion, 

Unto thee shall it come; 

Yea, the former dominion shall 
come, 

The kingdom of the daughter of 
Jerusalem. 

9Now why dost thou cry out aloud? 
Is there no King in thee, 

Is thy Counsellor perished, 

That pangs have taken hold of thee 
as of a woman in travail? 

10Be in pain, and labour to bring 
forth, O daughter of Zion, 

Like a woman in travail; 

For now shalt thou go forth out of 
the city, 

And shalt dwell in the field, 

And shalt come even unto Babylon; 

There shalt thou be rescued; 

There shall the LORD redeem thee 
from the hand of thine enemies. 

 

11And now many nations are 
assembled against thee, 

That say: ‘Let her be defiled, and let 
our eye gaze upon Zion.’ 

12But they know not the thoughts of 
the LORD, 

Neither understand they His 
counsel; 

For He hath gathered them as the 
sheaves to the threshing-floor. 

13Arise and thresh, O daughter of 
Zion; 


For I will make thy horn iron, 

And I will make thy hoofs brass; 

And thou shalt beat in pieces many 
peoples; 

And thou shalt devote their gain 
unto the LORD, 

And their substance unto the Lord of 
the whole earth. 

 

14Now shalt thou gather thyself in 
troops, O daughter of troops; 

They have laid siege against us; 

They smite the judge of Israel with a 
rod upon the cheek. 

 

But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, 
Which art little to be among the 
thousands of Judah, 

Out of thee shall one come forth 
unto Me that is to be ruler in 
Israel; 

Whose goings forth are from of old, 
from ancient days. 

2Therefore will He give them up, 

Until the time that she who 
travaileth hath brought forth; 

Then the residue of his brethren 
shall return with the children of 
Israel. 

3And he shall stand, and shall feed 
his flock in the strength of the 
LORD, 

In the majesty of the name of the 
LORD his God; 

And they shall abide, for then shall 
he be great unto the ends of the 
earth. 

4And this shall be peace: 

When the Assyrian shall come into 
our land, 

And when he shall tread in our 
palaces, 

Then shall we raise against him 
seven shepherds, 

And eight princes among men. 

5And they shall waste the land of 
Assyria with the sword, 

And the land of Nimrod with the 
keen-edged sword; 

And he shall deliver us from the 
Assyrian, when he cometh into 
our land, 

And when he treadeth within our 
border. 

 

6And the remnant of Jacob shall be 
in the midst of many peoples, 

As dew from the LORD, as showers 
upon the grass, 

That are not looked for from man, 

Nor awaited at the hands of the sons 
of men. 

7And the remnant of Jacob shall be 
among the nations, in the midst of 
many peoples, 

As a lion among the beasts of the 
forest, 

As a young lion among the flocks of 
sheep, 

Who, if he go through, treadeth 
down and teareth in pieces, 

And there is none to deliver. 

8Let Thy hand be lifted up above 
Thine adversaries, 

And let all Thine enemies be cut off. 

 
5 




9And it shall come to pass in that 
day, saith the LORD, 

That I will cut off thy horses out of 
the midst of thee, 

And will destroy thy chariots; 

10And I will cut off the cities of thy 
land, 

And will throw down all thy 
strongholds; 

11And I will cut off witchcrafts out 
of thy hand; 

And thou shalt have no more 
soothsayers; 

12And I will cut off thy graven 
images and thy pillars out of the 
midst of thee; 

And thou shalt no more worship the 
work of thy hands. 

13 And I will pluck up thy Asherim 
out of the midst of thee; 

And I will destroy thine enemies. 

14And I will execute vengeance in 
anger and fury upon the nations, 

Because they hearkened not. 

 

Hear ye now what the LORD saith: 
Arise, contend thou before the 
mountains, 

And let the hills hear thy voice. 

2Hear, O ye mountains, the LORD’S 
controversy, 

And ye enduring rocks, the 
foundations of the earth; 

For the LORD hath a controversy 
with His people, 

And He will plead with Israel. 

3O My people, what have I done 
unto thee? 

And wherein have I wearied thee? 

Testify against Me. 

4For I brought thee up out of the 
land of Egypt, 

And redeemed thee out of the house 
of bondage, 

And I sent before thee Moses, 
Aaron, and Miriam. 

5O My people, remember now what 
Balak king of Moab devised, 

And what Balaam the son of Beor 
answered him; 

From Shittim unto Gilgal, 

That ye may know the righteous acts 
of the LORD. 

6’Wherewith shall I come before the 
LORD, 

And bow myself before God on 
high? 

Shall I come before Him with burnt-
offerings, 

With calves of a year old? 

7Will the LORD be pleased with 
thousands of rams, 

With ten thousands of rivers of oil? 

Shall I give my first-born for my 
transgression, 

The fruit of my body for the sin of 
my soul?’ 

8It hath been told thee, O man, what 
is good, 

And what the LORD doth require of 
thee: 

Only to do justly, and to love mercy, 
and to walk humbly with thy 
God. 

 

9Hark! the LORD crieth unto the 
city— 
6 




And it is wisdom to have regard for 
Thy name— 

Hear ye the rod, and who hath 
appointed it. 

10Are there yet the treasures of 
wickedness in the house of the 
wicked, 

And the scant measure that is 
abominable? 

11’Shall I be pure with wicked 
balances, 

And with a bag of deceitful 
weights?’ 

12For the rich men thereof are full of 
violence, 

And the inhabitants thereof have 
spoken lies, 

And their tongue is deceitful in their 
mouth. 

13Therefore I also do smite thee with 
a grievous wound; 

I do make thee desolate because of 
thy sins. 

14Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; 

And thy sickness shall be in thine 
inward parts; 

And thou shalt conceive, but shalt 
not bring forth; 

And whomsoever thou bringest 
forth will I give up to the sword. 

15Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; 

Thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt 
not anoint thee with oil; 

And the vintage, but shalt not drink 
wine. 

16For the statutes of Omri are kept, 

And all the works of the house of 
Ahab, 

And ye walk in their counsels; 

That I may make thee an 
astonishment, 

And the inhabitants thereof a 
hissing; 

And ye shall bear the reproach of 
My people. 

 

Woe is me! for I am as the last of 
the summer fruits, 

As the grape gleanings of the 
vintage; 

There is no cluster to eat; 

Nor first-ripe fig which my soul 
desireth. 

2The godly man is perished out of 
the earth, 

And the upright among men is no 
more; 

They all lie in wait for blood; 

They hunt every man his brother 
with a net. 

3Their hands are upon that which is 
evil to do it diligently; 

The prince asketh, and the judge is 
ready for a reward; 

And the great man, he uttereth the 
evil desire of his soul; 

Thus they weave it together. 

4The best of them is as a brier; 

The most upright is worse than a 
thorn hedge; 

The day of thy watchmen, even thy 
visitation, is come; 

Now shall be their perplexity. 

5Trust ye not in a friend, 

Put ye not confidence in a familiar 
friend; 

Keep the doors of thy mouth from 
her that lieth in thy bosom. 
7 




6For the son dishonoureth the father, 

The daughter riseth up against her 
mother, 

The daughter-in-law against her 
mother-in-law; 

A man’s enemies are the men of his 
own house. 

 

7’But as for me, I will look unto the 
LORD; 

I will wait for the God of my 
salvation; 

My God will hear me. 

8Rejoice not against me, O mine 
enemy; 

Though I am fallen, I shall arise; 

Though I sit in darkness, the LORD is 
a light unto me. 

9I will bear the indignation of the 
LORD, 

Because I have sinned against Him; 

Until He plead my cause, and 
execute judgment for me; 

He will bring me forth to the light, 

And I shall behold His 
righteousness. 

10Then mine enemy shall see it, and 
shame shall cover her; 

Who said unto me: Where is the 
LORD thy God? 

Mine eyes shall gaze upon her; 

Now shall she be trodden down as 
the mire of the streets.’ 

11’The day for building thy walls, 
even that day, shall be far 
removed.’ 

12There shall be a day when they 
shall come unto thee, 

From Assyria even to the cities of 
Egypt, 

And from Egypt even to the River, 

And from sea to sea, and from 
mountain to mountain. 

13And the land shall be desolate for 
them that dwell therein, 

Because of the fruit of their doings. 

 

14Tend Thy people with Thy staff, 
the flock of Thy heritage, 

That dwell solitarily, as a forest in 
the midst of the fruitful field; 

Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, 
as in the days of old. 

15’As in the days of thy coming forth 
out of the land of Egypt 

Will I show unto him marvellous 
things.’ 

16The nations shall see and be put to 
shame for all their might; 

They shall lay their hand upon their 
mouth, 

Their ears shall be deaf. 

17They shall lick the dust like a 
serpent; 

Like crawling things of the earth 
they shall come trembling out of 
their close places; 

They shall come with fear unto the 
LORD our God, 

And shall be afraid because of Thee. 

18Who is a God like unto Thee, that 
pardoneth the iniquity, 

And passeth by the transgression of 
the remnant of His heritage? 

He retaineth not His anger for ever, 

Because He delighteth in mercy. 


19He will again have compassion 
upon us; 

He will subdue our iniquities; 

And Thou wilt cast all their sins into 
the depths of the sea. 

20Thou wilt show faithfulness to 
Jacob, mercy to Abraham, 

As Thou hast sworn unto our fathers 
from the days of old.
