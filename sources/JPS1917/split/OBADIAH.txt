OBADIAH 

 

The vision of Obadiah. 

Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning 
Edom: 

We have heard a message from the 
LORD, 

And an ambassador is sent among 
the nations: 

‘Arise ye, and let us rise up against 
her in battle.’ 

2Behold, I make thee small among 
the nations; 

Thou art greatly despised. 

3The pride of thy heart hath beguiled 
thee, 

O thou that dwellest in the clefts of 
the rock, 

Thy habitation on high; 

That sayest in thy heart: 

‘Who shall bring me down to the 
ground?’ 

4Though thou make thy nest as high 
as the eagle, 

And though thou set it among the 
stars, 
1 




I will bring thee down from thence, 
saith the LORD. 

5If thieves came to thee, if robbers 
by night— 

How art thou cut off!— 

Would they not steal till they had 
enough? 

If grape-gatherers came to thee, 

Would they not leave some gleaning 
grapes? 

6How is Esau searched out! 

How are his hidden places sought 
out! 

7All the men of thy confederacy 

Have conducted thee to the border; 

The men that were at peace with 
thee 

Have beguiled thee, and prevailed 
against thee; 

They that eat thy bread lay a snare 
under thee, 

In whom there is no discernment. 

8Shall I not in that day, saith the 
LORD, 

Destroy the wise men out of Edom, 

And discernment out of the mount 
of Esau? 

9And thy mighty men, O Teman, 
shall be dismayed, 

To the end that every one may be 
cut off from the mount of Esau by 
slaughter. 

10For the violence done to thy 
brother Jacob shame shall cover 
thee, 

And thou shalt be cut off for ever. 

11In the day that thou didst stand 
aloof, 

In the day that strangers carried 
away his substance, 

And foreigners entered into his 
gates, 

And cast lots upon Jerusalem, 

Even thou wast as one of them. 

12But thou shouldest not have gazed 
on the day of thy brother 

In the day of his disaster, 

Neither shouldest thou have rejoiced 
over the children of Judah 

In the day of their destruction; 

Neither shouldest thou have spoken 
proudly 

In the day of distress. 

13Thou shouldest not have entered 
into the gate of My people 

In the day of their calamity; 

Yea, thou shouldest not have gazed 
on their affliction 

In the day of their calamity, 

Nor have laid hands on their 
substance 

In the day of their calamity. 

14Neither shouldest thou have stood 
in the crossway, 

To cut off those of his that escape; 

Neither shouldest thou have 
delivered up those of his 

That did remain in the day of 
distress. 

 

15For the day of the LORD is near 
upon all the nations; 

As thou hast done, it shall be done 
unto thee; 

Thy dealing shall return upon thine 
own head. 


16For as ye have drunk upon My 
holy mountain, 

So shall all the nations drink 
continually, 

Yea, they shall drink, and swallow 
down, 

And shall be as though they had not 
been. 

17But in mount Zion there shall be 
those that escape, 

And it shall be holy; 

And the house of Jacob shall 
possess their possessions. 

18And the house of Jacob shall be a 
fire, 

And the house of Joseph a flame, 

And the house of Esau for stubble, 

And they shall kindle in them, and 
devour them; 

And there shall not be any 
remaining of the house of Esau; 

For the LORD hath spoken. 

19And they of the South shall 
possess the mount of Esau, 

And they of the Lowland the 
Philistines; 

And they shall possess the field of 
Ephraim, 

And the field of Samaria; 

And Benjamin shall possess Gilead. 

20And the captivity of this host of 
the children of Israel, 

That are among the Canaanites, 
even unto Zarephath, 

And the captivity of Jerusalem, that 
is in Sepharad, 

Shall possess the cities of the South. 

21And saviours shall come up on 
mount Zion 

To judge the mount of Esau; 

And the kingdom shall be the 
LORD’S.
