LEVITICUS 

 

And tHE LORD called unto Moses, 
and spoke unto him out of the tent 
of meeting, saying: 2Speak unto the 
children of Israel, and say unto them: 

When any man of you bringeth an 
offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring 
your offering of the cattle, even of the 
herd or of the flock. 

3If his offering be a burnt-offering 
of the herd, he shall offer it a male 
without blemish; he shall bring it to 
the door of the tent of meeting, that he 
may be accepted before the LORD. 
4And he shall lay his hand upon the 
head of the burnt-offering; and it shall 
be accepted for him to make 
atonement for him. 5And he shall kill 
the bullock before the LORD; and 
Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present 
the blood, and dash the blood round 
about against the altar that is at the 
door of the tent of meeting. 6And he 
shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it 
into its pieces. 7And the sons of Aaron 
the priest shall put fire upon the altar, 
and lay wood in order upon the fire. 
8And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall 
lay the pieces, and the head, and the 
suet, in order upon the wood that is on 
the fire which is upon the altar; 9but its 
inwards and its legs shall he wash with 
water; and the priest shall make the 
whole smoke on the altar, for a burnt-
offering, an offering made by fire, of a 
sweet savour unto the LORD. 

10And if his offering be of the flock, 
whether of the sheep, or of the goats, 
for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a 
male without blemish. 11And he shall 
kill it on the side of the altar northward 
before the LORD; and Aaron’s sons, the 
priests, shall dash its blood against the 
altar round about. 12And he shall cut it 
into its pieces; and the priest shall lay 
them, with its head and its suet, in 
order on the wood that is on the fire 
which is upon the altar. 13But the 
inwards and the legs shall he wash 
with water; and the priest shall offer 
the whole, and make it smoke upon the 
altar; it is a burnt-offering, an offering 
made by fire, of a sweet savour unto 
the LORD. 

14And if his offering to the LORD be 
a burnt-offering of fowls, then he shall 
bring his offering of turtle-doves, or of 
young pigeons. 15And the priest shall 
bring it unto the altar, and pinch off its 
head, and make it smoke on the altar; 
and the blood thereof shall be drained 
out on the side of the altar. 16And he 
shall take away its crop with the 
feathers thereof, and cast it beside the 
altar on the east part, in the place of 
the ashes. 17And he shall rend it by the 
wings thereof, but shall not divide it 
asunder; and the priest shall make it 
1 




smoke upon the altar, upon the wood 
that is upon the fire; it is a burnt-
offering, an offering made by fire, of a 
sweet savour unto the LORD. 

And when any one bringeth a 
meal-offering unto the LORD, his 
offering shall be of fine flour; and he 
shall pour oil upon it, and put 
frankincense thereon. 2And he shall 
bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; 
and he shall take thereout his handful 
of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil 
thereof, together with all the 
frankincense thereof; and the priest 
shall make the memorial-part thereof 
smoke upon the altar, an offering made 
by fire, of a sweet savour unto the 
LORD. 3But that which is left of the 
meal-offering shall be Aaron’s and his 
sons’; it is a thing most holy of the 
offerings of the LORD made by fire. 

4And when thou bringest a meal-
offering baked in the oven, it shall be 
unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled 
with oil, or unleavened wafers spread 
with oil. 

5And if thy offering be a meal-
offering baked on a griddle, it shall be 
of fine flour unleavened, mingled with 
oil. 6Thou shalt break it in pieces, and 
pour oil thereon; it is a meal-offering. 

7And if thy offering be a meal-
offering of the stewing-pan, it shall be 
made of fine flour with oil. 8And thou 
shalt bring the meal-offering that is 
made of these things unto the LORD; 
and it shall be presented unto the 
priest, and he shall bring it unto the 
altar. 9And the priest shall take off 
from the meal-offering the memorial-
part thereof, and shall make it smoke 
upon the altar—an offering made by 
fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
10But that which is left of the meal-
offering shall be Aaron’s and his 
sons’; it is a thing most holy of the 
offerings of the LORD made by fire. 
11No meal-offering, which ye shall 
bring unto the LORD, shall be made 
with leaven; for ye shall make no 
leaven, nor any honey, smoke as an 
offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
12As an offering of first-fruits ye may 
bring them unto the LORD; but they 
shall not come up for a sweet savour 
on the altar. 13And every meal-offering 
of thine shalt thou season with salt; 
neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the 
covenant of thy God to be lacking 
from thy meal-offering; with all thy 
offerings thou shalt offer salt. 

14And if thou bring a meal-offering 
of first-fruits unto the LORD, thou shalt 
bring for the meal-offering of thy first-
fruits corn in the ear parched with fire, 
even groats of the fresh ear. 15And 
thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay 
frankincense thereon; it is a meal-
offering. 16And the priest shall make 
the memorial-part of it smoke, even of 
the groats thereof, and of the oil 
thereof, with all the frankincense 
thereof; it is an offering made by fire 
unto the LORD. 

And if his offering be a sacrifice 
of peace-offerings: if he offer of 
the herd, whether male or female, he 
shall offer it without blemish before 
2 

3 




the LORD. 2And he shall lay his hand 
upon the head of his offering, and kill 
it at the door of the tent of meeting; 
and Aaron’s sons the priests shall dash 
the blood against the altar round about. 
3And he shall present of the sacrifice 
of peace-offerings an offering made by 
fire unto the LORD: the fat that covereth 
the inwards, and all the fat that is upon 
the inwards, 4and the two kidneys, and 
the fat that is on them, which is by the 
loins, and the lobe above the liver, 
which he shall take away hard by the 
kidneys. 5And Aaron’s sons shall make 
it smoke on the altar upon the burnt-
offering, which is upon the wood that 
is on the fire; it is an offering made by 
fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 

6And if his offering for a sacrifice of 
peace-offerings unto the LORD be of 
the flock, male or female, he shall 
offer it without blemish. 7If he bring a 
lamb for his offering, then shall he 
present it before the LORD. 8And he 
shall lay his hand upon the head of his 
offering, and kill it before the tent of 
meeting; and Aaron’s sons shall dash 
the blood thereof against the altar 
round about. 9And he shall present of 
the sacrifice of peace-offerings an 
offering made by fire unto the LORD: 
the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, which 
he shall take away hard by the rump-
bone; and the fat that covereth the 
inwards, and all the fat that is upon the 
inwards, 10and the two kidneys, and 
the fat that is upon them, which is by 
the loins, and the lobe above the liver, 
which he shall take away by the 
kidneys. 11And the priest shall make it 
smoke upon the altar; it is the food of 
the offering made by fire unto the 
LORD. 

12And if his offering be a goat, then 
he shall present it before the LORD. 
13And he shall lay his hand upon the 
head of it, and kill it before the tent of 
meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall 
dash the blood thereof against the altar 
round about. 14And he shall present 
thereof his offering, even an offering 
made by fire unto the LORD: the fat that 
covereth the inwards, and all the fat 
that is upon the inwards, 15and the two 
kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, 
which is by the loins, and the lobe 
above the liver, which he shall take 
away by the kidneys. 16And the priest 
shall make them smoke upon the altar; 
it is the food of the offering made by 
fire, for a sweet savour; all the fat is 
the LORD’S. 17It shall be a perpetual 
statute throughout your generations in 
all your dwellings, that ye shall eat 
neither fat nor blood. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 2Speak unto the children 
of Israel, saying: 

If any one shall sin through error, in 
any of the things which the LORD hath 
commanded not to be done, and shall 
do any one of them: 3if the anointed 
priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on 
the people, then let him offer for his 
sin, which he hath sinned, a young 
bullock without blemish unto the LORD 
for a sin-offering. 4And he shall bring 
4 




the bullock unto the door of the tent of 
meeting before the LORD; and he shall 
lay his hand upon the head of the 
bullock, and kill the bullock before the 
LORD. 5And the anointed priest shall 
take of the blood of the bullock, and 
bring it to the tent of meeting. 6And 
the priest shall dip his finger in the 
blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven 
times before the LORD, in front of the 
veil of the sanctuary. 7And the priest 
shall put of the blood upon the horns 
of the altar of sweet incense before the 
LORD, which is in the tent of meeting; 
and all the remaining blood of the 
bullock shall he pour out at the base of 
the altar of burnt-offering, which is at 
the door of the tent of meeting. 8And 
all the fat of the bullock of the sin-
offering he shall take off from it; the 
fat that covereth the inwards, and all 
the fat that is upon the inwards, 9and 
the two kidneys, and the fat that is 
upon them, which is by the loins, and 
the lobe above the liver, which he shall 
take away by kidneys, 10as it is taken 
off from the ox of the sacrifice of 
peace-offerings; and the priest shall 
make them smoke upon the altar of 
burnt-offering. 11But the skin of the 
bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, 
and with its legs, and its inwards, and 
its dung, 12even the whole bullock 
shall he carry forth without the camp 
unto a clean place, where the ashes are 
poured out, and burn it on wood with 
fire; where the ashes are poured out 
shall it be burnt. 

13And if the whole congregation of 
Israel shall err, the thing being hid 
from the eyes of the assembly, and do 
any of the things which the LORD hath 
commanded not to be done, and are 
guilty: 14when the sin wherein they 
have sinned is known, then the 
assembly shall offer a young bullock 
for a sin-offering, and bring it before 
the tent of meeting. 15And the elders of 
the congregation shall lay their hands 
upon the head of the bullock before the 
LORD; and the bullock shall be killed 
before the LORD. 16And the anointed 
priest shall bring of the blood of the 
bullock to the tent of meeting. 17And 
the priest shall dip his finger in the 
blood, and sprinkle it seven times 
before the LORD, in front of the veil. 
18And he shall put of the blood upon 
the horns of the altar which is before 
the LORD, that is in the tent of meeting, 
and all the remaining blood shall he 
pour out at the base of the altar of 
burnt-offering, which is at the door of 
the tent of meeting. 19And all the fat 
thereof shall he take off from it, and 
make it smoke upon the altar. 20Thus 
shall he do with the bullock; as he did 
with the bullock of the sin-offering, so 
shall he do with this; and the priest 
shall make atonement for them, and 
they shall be forgiven. 21And he shall 
carry forth the bullock without the 
camp, and burn it as he burned the first 
bullock; it is the sin-offering for the 
assembly. 

22When a ruler sinneth, and doeth 
through error any one of all the things 


which the LORD his God hath 
commanded not to be done, and is 
guilty: 23if his sin, wherein he hath 
sinned, be known to him, he shall 
bring for his offering a goat, a male 
without blemish. 24And he shall lay his 
hand upon the head of the goat, and 
kill it in the place where they kill the 
burnt-offering before the LORD; it is a 
sin-offering. 25And the priest shall take 
of the blood of the sin-offering with 
his finger, and put it upon the horns of 
the altar of burnt-offering, and the 
remaining blood thereof shall he pour 
out at the base of the altar of burnt-
offering. 26And all the fat thereof shall 
he make smoke upon the altar, as the 
fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; 
and the priest shall make atonement 
for him as concerning his sin, and he 
shall be forgiven. 

27And if any one of the common 
people sin through error, in doing any 
of the things which the LORD hath 
commanded not to be done, and be 
guilty: 28if his sin, which he hath 
sinned, be known to him, then he shall 
bring for his offering a goat, a female 
without blemish, for his sin which he 
hath sinned. 29And he shall lay his 
hand upon the head of the sin-offering, 
and kill the sin-offering in the place of 
burnt-offering. 30And the priest shall 
take of the blood thereof with his 
finger, and put it upon the horns of the 
altar of burnt-offering, and all the 
remaining blood thereof shall he pour 
out at the base of the altar. 31And all 
the fat thereof shall he take away, as 
the fat is taken away from off the 
sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the 
priest shall make it smoke upon the 
altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; 
and the priest shall make atonement 
for him, and he shall be forgiven. 

32And if he bring a lamb as his 
offering for a sin-offering, he shall 
bring it a female without blemish. 
33And he shall lay his hand upon the 
head of the sin-offering, and kill it for 
a sin-offering in the place where they 
kill the burnt-offering. 34And the priest 
shall take of the blood of the sin-
offering with his finger, and put it 
upon the horns of the altar of burnt-
offering, and all the remaining blood 
thereof shall he pour out at the base of 
the altar. 35And all the fat thereof shall 
he take away, as the fat of the lamb is 
taken away from the sacrifice of 
peace-offerings; and the priest shall 
make them smoke on the altar, upon 
the offerings of the LORD made by fire; 
and the priest shall make atonement 
for him as touching his sin that he hath 
sinned, and he shall be forgiven. 

And if any one sin, in that he 
heareth the voice of adjuration, he 
being a witness, whether he hath seen 
or known, if he do not utter it, then he 
shall bear his iniquity; 2or if any one 
touch any unclean thing, whether it be 
the carcass of an unclean beast, or the 
carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass 
of unclean swarming things, and be 
guilty, it being hidden from him that 
he is unclean; 3or if he touch the 
uncleanness of man, whatsoever his 
5 




uncleanness be wherewith he is 
unclean, and it be hid from him; and, 
when he knoweth of it, be guilty; 4or if 
any one swear clearly with his lips to 
do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be 
that a man shall utter clearly with an 
oath, and it be hid from him; and, 
when he knoweth of it, be guilty in one 
of these things; 5and it shall be, when 
he shall be guilty in one of these 
things, that he shall confess that 
wherein he hath sinned; 6and he shall 
bring his forfeit unto the LORD for his 
sin which he hath sinned, a female 
from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a 
sin-offering; and the priest shall make 
atonement for him as concerning his 
sin. 7And if his means suffice not for a 
lamb, then he shall bring his forfeit for 
that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-
doves, or two young pigeons, unto the 
LORD: one for a sin-offering, and the 
other for a burnt-offering. 8And he 
shall bring them unto the priest, who 
shall offer that which is for the sin-
offering first, and pinch off its head 
close by its neck, but shall not divide it 
asunder. 9And he shall sprinkle of the 
blood of the sin-offering upon the side 
of the altar; and the rest of the blood 
shall be drained out at the base of the 
altar; it is a sin-offering. 10And he shall 
prepare the second for a burnt-
offering, according to the ordinance; 
and the priest shall make atonement 
for him as concerning his sin which he 
hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven. 

11But if his means suffice not for 
two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, 
then he shall bring his offering for that 
wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part 
of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-
offering; he shall put no oil upon it, 
neither shall he put any frankincense 
thereon; for it is a sin-offering. 12And 
he shall bring it to the priest, and the 
priest shall take his handful of it as the 
memorial-part thereof, and make it 
smoke on the altar, upon the offerings 
of the LORD made by fire; it is a sin-
offering. 13And the priest shall make 
atonement for him as touching his sin 
that he hath sinned in any of these 
things, and he shall be forgiven; and 
the remnant shall be the priest’s, as the 
meal-offering. 

14And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 15If any one commit a trespass, 
and sin through error, in the holy 
things of the LORD, then he shall bring 
his forfeit unto the LORD, a ram 
without blemish out of the flock, 
according to thy valuation in silver by 
shekels, after the shekel of the 
sanctuary, for a guilt-offering. 16And 
he shall make restitution for that which 
he hath done amiss in the holy thing, 
and shall add the fifth part thereto, and 
give it unto the priest; and the priest 
shall make atonement for him with the 
ram of the guilt-offering, and he shall 
be forgiven. 

17And if any one sin, and do any of 
the things which the LORD hath 
commanded not to be done, though he 
know it not, yet is he guilty, and shall 
bear his iniquity. 18And he shall bring 
a ram without blemish out of the flock, 


according to thy valuation, for a guilt-
offering, unto the priest; and the priest 
shall make atonement for him 
concerning the error which he 
committed, though he knew it not, and 
he shall be forgiven. 19It is a guilt-
offering—he is certainly guilty before 
the LORD. 

20And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 21If any one sin, and commit a 
trespass against the LORD, and deal 
falsely with his neighbour in a matter 
of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, 
or have oppressed his neighbour; 22or 
have found that which was lost, and 
deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; 
in any of all these that a man doeth, 
sinning therein; 23then it shall be, if he 
hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall 
restore that which he took by robbery, 
or the thing which he hath gotten by 
oppression, or the deposit which was 
deposited with him, or the lost thing 
which he found, 24or any thing about 
which he hath sworn falsely, he shall 
even restore it in full, and shall add the 
fifth part more thereto; unto him to 
whom it appertaineth shall he give it, 
in the day of his being guilty. 25And he 
shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD, a 
ram without blemish out of the flock, 
according to thy valuation, for a guilt-
offering, unto the priest. 26And the 
priest shall make atonement for him 
before the LORD, and he shall be 
forgiven, concerning whatsoever he 
doeth so as to be guilty thereby. 

 


And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 2 Command Aaron and his 
sons, saying: 

This is the law of the burnt-offering: 
it is that which goeth up on its 
firewood upon the altar all night unto 
the morning; and the fire of the altar 
shall be kept burning thereby. 3And the 
priest shall put on his linen garment, 
and his linen breeches shall he put 
upon his flesh; and he shall take up the 
ashes whereto the fire hath consumed 
the burnt-offering on the altar, and he 
shall put them beside the altar. 4And he 
shall put off his garments, and put on 
other garments, and carry forth the 
ashes without the camp unto a clean 
place. 5And the fire upon the altar shall 
be kept burning thereby, it shall not go 
out; and the priest shall kindle wood 
on it every morning; and he shall lay 
the burnt-offering in order upon it, and 
shall make smoke thereon the fat of 
the peace-offerings. 6Fire shall be kept 
burning upon the altar continually; it 
shall not go out. 

7And this is the law of the meal-
offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer 
it before the LORD, in front of the altar. 
8And he shall take up therefrom his 
handful, of the fine flour of the meal-
offering, and of the oil thereof, and all 
the frankincense which is upon the 
meal-offering, and shall make the 
memorial-part thereof smoke upon the 
altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
9And that which is left thereof shall 
Aaron and his sons eat; it shall be 
eaten without leaven in a holy place; in 
6 




the court of the tent of meeting they 
shall eat it. 10It shall not be baked with 
leaven. I have given it as their portion 
of My offerings made by fire; it is 
most holy, as the sin-offering, and as 
the guilt-offering. 11Every male among 
the children of Aaron may eat of it, as 
a due for ever throughout your 
generations, from the offerings of the 
LORD made by fire; whatsoever 
toucheth them shall be holy. 

12And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 13This is the offering of Aaron 
and of his sons, which they shall offer 
unto the LORD in the day when he is 
anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of 
fine flour for a meal-offering 
perpetually, half of it in the morning, 
and half thereof in the evening. 14On a 
griddle it shall be made with oil; when 
it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in; in 
broken pieces shalt thou offer the 
meal-offering for a sweet savour unto 
the LORD. 15And the anointed priest 
that shall be in his stead from among 
his sons shall offer it, it is a due for 
ever; it shall be wholly made to smoke 
unto the LORD. 16And every meal-
offering of the priest shall be wholly 
made to smoke; it shall not be eaten. 

17And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 18Speak unto Aaron and to his 
sons, saying: 

This is the law of the sin-offering: in 
the place where the burnt-offering is 
killed shall the sin-offering be killed 
before the LORD; it is most holy. 19The 
priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it; 
in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the 
court of the tent of meeting. 
20Whatsoever shall touch the flesh 
thereof shall be holy; and when there 
is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon 
any garment, thou shalt wash that 
whereon it was sprinkled in a holy 
place. 21But the earthen vessel wherein 
it is sodden shall be broken; and if it 
be sodden in a brazen vessel, it shall 
be scoured, and rinsed in water. 
22Every male among the priests may 
eat thereof; it is most holy. 23And no 
sin-offering, whereof any of the blood 
is brought into the tent of meeting to 
make atonement in the holy place, 
shall be eaten; it shall be burnt with 
fire. 

And this is the law of the guilt-
offering: it is most holy. 2In the 
place where they kill the burnt-
offering shall they kill the guilt-
offering: and the blood thereof shall be 
dashed against the altar round about. 
3And he shall offer of it all the fat 
thereof: the fat tail, and the fat that 
covereth the inwards, 4and the two 
kidneys, and the fat that is on them, 
which is by the loins, and the lobe 
above the liver, which he shall take 
away by the kidneys. 5And the priest 
shall make them smoke upon the altar 
for an offering made by fire unto the 
LORD; it is a guilt-offering. 6Every 
male among the priests may eat 
thereof; it shall be eaten in a holy 
place; it is most holy. 7As is the sin-
offering, so is the guilt-offering; there 
is one law for them; the priest that 
maketh atonement therewith, he shall 
7 




have it. 8And the priest that offereth 
any man’s burnt-offering, even the 
priest shall have to himself the skin of 
the burnt-offering which he hath 
offered. 9And every meal-offering that 
is baked in the oven, and all that is 
dressed in the stewing-pan, and on the 
griddle, shall be the priest’s that 
offereth it. 10And every meal-offering, 
mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the 
sons of Aaron have, one as well as 
another. 

11And this is the law of the sacrifice 
of peace-offerings, which one may 
offer unto the LORD. 12If he offer it for 
a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with 
the sacrifice of thanksgiving 
unleavened cakes mingled with oil, 
and unleavened wafers spread with oil, 
and cakes mingled with oil, of fine 
flour soaked. 13With cakes of leavened 
bread he shall present his offering with 
the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for 
thanksgiving. 14And of it he shall 
present one out of each offering for a 
gift unto the LORD; it shall be the 
priest’s that dasheth the blood of the 
peace-offerings against the altar. 15And 
the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-
offerings for thanksgiving shall be 
eaten on the day of his offering; he 
shall not leave any of it until the 
morning. 16But if the sacrifice of his 
offering be a vow, or a freewill-
offering, it shall be eaten on the day 
that he offereth his sacrifice; and on 
the morrow that which remaineth of it 
may be eaten. 17But that which 
remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice 
on the third day shall be burnt with 
fire. 18And if any of the flesh of the 
sacrifice of his peace-offerings be at 
all eaten on the third day, it shall not 
be accepted, neither shall it be imputed 
unto him that offereth it; it shall be an 
abhorred thing, and the soul that eateth 
of it shall bear his iniquity. 19And the 
flesh that toucheth any unclean thing 
shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt 
with fire. And as for the flesh, every 
one that is clean may eat thereof. 20But 
the soul that eateth of the flesh of the 
sacrifice of peace-offerings, that 
pertain unto the LORD, having his 
uncleanness upon him, that soul shall 
be cut off from his people. 21And when 
any one shall touch any unclean thing, 
whether it be the uncleanness of man, 
or an unclean beast, or any unclean 
detestable thing, and eat of the flesh of 
the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which 
pertain unto the LORD, that soul shall 
be cut off from his people. 

22And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 23Speak unto the children of 
Israel, saying: 

Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, 
or goat. 24And the fat of that which 
dieth of itself, and the fat of that which 
is torn of beasts, may be used for any 
other service; but ye shall in no wise 
eat of it. 25For whosoever eateth the fat 
of the beast, of which men present an 
offering made by fire unto the LORD, 
even the soul that eateth it shall be cut 
off from his people. 26And ye shall eat 
no manner of blood, whether it be of 
fowl or of beast, in any of your 


dwellings. 27Whosoever it be that 
eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut 
off from his people. 

28And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 29Speak unto the children of 
Israel, saying: 

He that offereth his sacrifice of 
peace-offerings unto the LORD shall 
bring his offering unto the LORD out of 
his sacrifice of peace-offerings. 30His 
own hands shall bring the offerings of 
the LORD made by fire: the fat with the 
breast shall he bring, that the breast 
may be waved for a wave-offering 
before the LORD. 31And the priest shall 
make the fat smoke upon the altar; but 
the breast shall be Aaron’s and his 
sons’. 32And the right thigh shall ye 
give unto the priest for a heave-
offering out of your sacrifices of 
peace-offerings. 33He among the sons 
of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the 
peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have 
the right thigh for a portion. 34For the 
breast of waving and the thigh of 
heaving have I taken of the children of 
Israel out of their sacrifices of peace-
offerings, and have given them unto 
Aaron the priest and unto his sons as a 
due for ever from the children of 
Israel. 

35This is the consecrated portion of 
Aaron, and the consecrated portion of 
his sons, out of the offerings of the 
LORD made by fire, in the day when 
they were presented to minister unto 
the LORD in the priest’s office; 36which 
the LORD commanded to be given them 
of the children of Israel, in the day that 
they were anointed. It is a due for ever 
throughout their generations. 

37This is the law of the burnt-
offering, of the meal-offering, and of 
the sin-offering, and of the guilt-
offering, and of the consecration-
offering, and of the sacrifice of peace-
offerings; 38which the LORD 
commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in 
the day that he commanded the 
children of Israel to present their 
offerings unto the LORD, in the 
wilderness of Sinai. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 2’Take Aaron and his sons 
with him, and the garments, and the 
anointing oil, and the bullock of the 
sin-offering, and the two rams, and the 
basket of unleavened bread; 3and 
assemble thou all the congregation at 
the door of the tent of meeting.’ 4And 
Moses did as the LORD commanded 
him; and the congregation was 
assembled at the door of the tent of 
meeting. 5And Moses said unto the 
congregation: ‘This is the thing which 
the LORD hath commanded to be done.’ 
6And Moses brought Aaron and his 
sons, and washed them with water. 
7And he put upon him the tunic, and 
girded him with the girdle, and clothed 
him with the robe, and put the ephod 
upon him, and he girded him with the 
skilfully woven band of the ephod, and 
bound it unto him therewith. 8And he 
placed the breastplate upon him; and 
in the breastplate he put the Urim and 
the Thummim. 9And he set the mitre 
8 




upon his head; and upon the mitre, in 
front, did he set the golden plate, the 
holy crown; as the LORD commanded 
Moses. 10And Moses took the 
anointing oil, and anointed the 
tabernacle and all that was therein, and 
sanctified them. 11And he sprinkled 
thereof upon the altar seven times, and 
anointed the altar and all its vessels, 
and the laver and its base, to sanctify 
them. 12And he poured of the anointing 
oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed 
him, to sanctify him. 13And Moses 
brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed 
them with tunics, and girded them with 
girdles, and bound head-tires upon 
them; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
14And the bullock of the sin-offering 
was brought; and Aaron and his sons 
laid their hands upon the head of the 
bullock of the sin-offering. 15And 
when it was slain, Moses took the 
blood, and put it upon the horns of the 
altar round about with his finger, and 
purified the altar, and poured out the 
remaining blood at the base of the 
altar, and sanctified it, to make 
atonement for it. 16And he took all the 
fat that was upon the inwards, and the 
lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, 
and their fat, and Moses made it 
smoke upon the altar. 17But the 
bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and 
its dung, were burnt with fire without 
the camp; as the LORD commanded 
Moses. 18And the ram of the burnt-
offering was presented; and Aaron and 
his sons laid their hands upon the head 
of the ram. 19And when it was killed, 
Moses dashed the blood against the 
altar round about. 20And when the ram 
was cut into its pieces, Moses made 
the head, and the pieces, and the suet 
smoke. 21And when the inwards and 
the legs were washed with water, 
Moses made the whole ram smoke 
upon the altar; it was a burnt-offering 
for a sweet savour; it was an offering 
made by fire unto the LORD; as the 
LORD commanded Moses. 22And the 
other ram was presented, the ram of 
consecration, and Aaron and his sons 
laid their hands upon the head of the 
ram. 23And when it was slain, Moses 
took of the blood thereof, and put it 
upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and 
upon the thumb of his right hand, and 
upon the great toe of his right foot. 
24And Aaron’s sons were brought, and 
Moses put of the blood upon the tip of 
their right ear, and upon the thumb of 
their right hand, and upon the great toe 
of their right foot; and Moses dashed 
the blood against the altar round about. 
25And he took the fat, and the fat tail, 
and all the fat that was upon the 
inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and 
the two kidneys, and their fat, and the 
right thigh. 26And out of the basket of 
unleavened bread, that was before the 
LORD, he took one unleavened cake, 
and one cake of oiled bread, and one 
wafer, and placed them on the fat, and 
upon the right thigh. 27And he put the 
whole upon the hands of Aaron, and 
upon the hands of his sons, and waved 
them for a wave-offering before the 
LORD. 28And Moses took them from off 


their hands, and made them smoke on 
the altar upon the burnt-offering; they 
were a consecration-offering for a 
sweet savour; it was an offering made 
by fire unto the LORD. 29And Moses 
took the breast, and waved it for a 
wave-offering before the LORD; it was 
Moses’portion of the ram of 
consecration; as the LORD commanded 
Moses. 30And Moses took of the 
anointing oil, and of the blood which 
was upon the altar, and sprinkled it 
upon Aaron, and upon his garments, 
and upon his sons, and upon his 
sons’garments with him, and sanctified 
Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, 
and his sons’garments with him. 31And 
Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons: 
‘Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of 
meeting; and there eat it and the bread 
that is in the basket of consecration, as 
I commanded, saying: Aaron and his 
sons shall eat it. 32And that which 
remaineth of the flesh and of the bread 
shall ye burn with fire. 33And ye shall 
not go out from the door of the tent of 
meeting seven days, until the days of 
your consecration be fulfilled; for He 
shall consecrate you seven days. 34As 
hath been done this day, so the LORD 
hath commanded to do, to make 
atonement for you. 35And at the door 
of the tent of meeting shall ye abide 
day and night seven days, and keep the 
charge of the LORD, that ye die not; for 
so I am commanded. 36And Aaron and 
his sons did all the things which the 
LORD commanded by the hand of 
Moses. 

 

 


And it came to pass on the eighth 
day, that Moses called Aaron and 
his sons, and the elders of Israel; 2and 
he said unto Aaron: ‘Take thee a bull-
calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a 
burnt-offering, without blemish, and 
offer them before the LORD. 3And unto 
the children of Israel thou shalt speak, 
saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin-
offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of 
the first year, without blemish, for a 
burnt-offering; 4and an ox and a ram 
for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before 
the LORD; and a meal-offering mingled 
with oil; for to-day the LORD appeareth 
unto you.’ 5And they brought that 
which Moses commanded before the 
tent of meeting; and all the 
congregation drew near and stood 
before the LORD. 6And Moses said: 
‘This is the thing which the LORD 
commanded that ye should do; that the 
glory of the LORD may appear unto 
you.’ 7And Moses said unto Aaron: 
‘Draw near unto the altar, and offer 
thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-
offering, and make atonement for 
thyself, and for the people; and present 
the offering of the people, and make 
atonement for them; as the LORD 
commanded.’ 8So Aaron drew near 
unto the altar, and slew the calf of the 
sin-offering, which was for himself. 
9And the sons of Aaron presented the 
blood unto him; and he dipped his 
finger in the blood, and put it upon the 
9 




horns of the altar, and poured out the 
blood at the base of the altar. 10But the 
fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of 
the liver of the sin-offering, he made 
smoke upon the altar; as the LORD 
commanded Moses. 11And the flesh 
and the skin were burnt with fire 
without the camp. 12And he slew the 
burnt-offering; and Aaron’s sons 
delivered unto him the blood, and he 
dashed it against the altar round about. 
13And they delivered the burnt-offering 
unto him, piece by piece, and the head; 
and he made them smoke upon the 
altar. 14And he washed the inwards and 
the legs, and made them smoke upon 
the burnt-offering on the altar. 15And 
the people’s offering was presented; 
and he took the goat of the sin-offering 
which was for the people, and slew it, 
and offered it for sin, as the first. 
16And the burnt-offering was 
presented; and he offered it according 
to the ordinance. 17And the meal-
offering was presented; and he filled 
his hand therefrom, and made it smoke 
upon the altar, besides the burnt-
offering of the morning. 18He slew also 
the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of 
peace-offerings, which was for the 
people; and Aaron’s sons delivered 
unto him the blood, and he dashed it 
against the altar round about, 19and the 
fat of the ox, and of the ram, the fat 
tail, and that which covereth the 
inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe 
of the liver. 20And they put the fat 
upon the breasts, and he made the fat 
smoke upon the altar. 21And the 
breasts and the right thigh Aaron 
waved for a wave-offering before the 
LORD; as Moses commanded. 22And 
Aaron lifted up his hands toward the 
people, and blessed them; and he came 
down from offering the sin-offering, 
and the burnt-offering, and the peace-
offerings. 23And Moses and Aaron 
went into the tent of meeting, and 
came out, and blessed the people; and 
the glory of the LORD appeared unto all 
the people. 24And there came forth fire 
from before the LORD, and consumed 
upon the altar the burnt-offering and 
the fat; and when all the people saw it, 
they shouted, and fell on their faces. 

And Nadab and Abihu, the 
sons of Aaron, took each of 
them his censer, and put fire therein, 
and laid incense thereon, and offered 
strange fire before the LORD, which He 
had not commanded them. 2And there 
came forth fire from before the LORD, 
and devoured them, and they died 
before the LORD. 3Then Moses said 
unto Aaron: ‘This is it that the LORD 
spoke, saying: Through them that are 
nigh unto Me I will be sanctified, and 
before all the people I will be 
glorified.’ And Aaron held his peace. 
4And Moses called Mishael and 
Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle 
of Aaron, and said unto them: ‘Draw 
near, carry your brethren from before 
the sanctuary out of the camp.’ 5So 
they drew near, and carried them in 
their tunics out of the camp, as Moses 
had said. 6And Moses said unto Aaron, 
and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his 
10 




sons: ‘Let not the hair of your heads 
go loose, neither tend your clothes, 
that ye die not, and that He be not 
wroth with all the congregation; but let 
your brethren, the whole house of 
Israel, bewail the burning which the 
LORD hath kindled. 7And ye shall not 
go out from the door of the tent of 
meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing 
oil of the LORD is upon you.’ And they 
did according to the word of Moses. 

 

8And the LORD spoke unto Aaron, 
saying: 9’Drink no wine nor strong 
drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, 
when ye go into the tent of meeting, 
that ye die not; it shall be a statute 
forever throughout your generations. 
10And that ye may put difference 
between the holy and the common, and 
between the unclean and the clean; 
11and that ye may teach the children of 
Israel all the statutes which the LORD 
hath spoken unto them by the hand of 
Moses.’ 

12And Moses spoke unto Aaron, and 
unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his 
sons that were left: ‘Take the meal-
offering that remaineth of the offerings 
of the LORD made by fire, and eat it 
without leaven beside the altar; for it is 
most holy. 13And ye shall eat it in a 
holy place, because it is thy due, and 
thy sons’due, of the offerings of the 
LORD made by fire; for so I am 
commanded. 14And the breast of 
waving and the thigh of heaving shall 
ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy 
sons, and thy daughters with thee; for 
they are given as thy due, and thy 
sons’due, out of the sacrifices of the 
peace-offerings of the children of 
Israel. 15The thigh of heaving and the 
breast of waving shall they bring with 
the offerings of the fat made by fire, to 
wave it for a wave-offering before the 
LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy 
sons’with thee, as a due for ever; as 
the LORD hath commanded.’ 

16And Moses diligently inquired for 
the goat of the sin-offering, and, 
behold, it was burnt; and he was angry 
with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the 
sons of Aaron that were left, saying: 
17’Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-
offering in the place of the sanctuary, 
seeing it is most holy, and He hath 
given it you to bear the iniquity of the 
congregation, to make atonement for 
them before the LORD? 18Behold, the 
blood of it was not brought into the 
sanctuary within; ye should certainly 
have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I 
commanded.’ 19And Aaron spoke unto 
Moses: ‘Behold, this day have they 
offered their sin-offering and their 
burnt-offering before the LORD, and 
there have befallen me such things as 
these; and if I had eaten the sin-
offering to-day, would it have been 
well-pleasing in the sight of the LORD? 
20And when Moses heard that, it was 
well-pleasing in his sight. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses and to Aaron, saying 
unto them: 2Speak unto the children of 
Israel, saying: 
11 




These are the living things which ye 
may eat among all the beasts that are 
on the earth. 3Whatsoever parteth the 
hoof, and is wholly cloven-footed, and 
cheweth the cud, among the beasts, 
that may ye eat. 4Nevertheless these 
shall ye not eat of them that only chew 
the cud, or of them that only part the 
hoof: the camel, because he cheweth 
the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is 
unclean unto you. 5And the rock-
badger, because he cheweth the cud 
but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean 
unto you. 6And the hare, because she 
cheweth the cud but parteth not the 
hoof, she is unclean unto you 7And the 
swine, because he parteth the hoof, 
and is cloven-footed, but cheweth not 
the cud, he is unclean unto you. 8Of 
their flesh ye shall not eat, and their 
carcasses ye shall not touch; they are 
unclean unto you. 

9These may ye eat of all that are in 
the waters: whatsoever hath fins and 
scales in the waters, in the seas, and in 
the rivers, them may ye eat. 10And all 
that have not fins and scales in the 
seas, and in the rivers, of all that 
swarm in the waters, and of all the 
living creatures that are in the waters, 
they are a detestable thing unto you, 
11and they shall be a detestable thing 
unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, 
and their carcasses ye shall have in 
detestation. 12Whatsoever hath no fins 
nor scales in the waters, that is a 
detestable thing unto you. 

13And these ye shall have in 
detestation among the fowls; they shall 
not be eaten, they are a detestable 
thing: the great vulture, and the 
bearded vulture, and the ospray; 14and 
the kite, and the falcon after its kinds; 
15every raven after its kinds; 16and the 
ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the 
sea-mew, and the hawk after its kinds; 
17and the little owl, and the cormorant, 
and the great owl; 18and the horned 
owl, and the pelican, and the carrion-
vulture; 19and the stork, and the heron 
after its kinds, and the hoopoe, and the 
bat. 

20All winged swarming things that 
go upon all fours are a detestable thing 
unto you. 21Yet these may ye eat of all 
winged swarming things that go upon 
all fours, which have jointed legs 
above their feet, wherewith to leap 
upon the earth; 22even these of them ye 
may eat: the locust after its kinds, and 
the bald locust after its kinds, and the 
cricket after its kinds, and the 
grasshopper after its kinds. 23But all 
winged swarming things, which have 
four feet, are a detestable thing unto 
you. 

24And by these ye shall become 
unclean; whosoever toucheth the 
carcass of them shall be unclean until 
even. 25And whosoever beareth aught 
of the carcass of them shall wash his 
clothes, and be unclean until the even. 
26Every beast which parteth the hoof, 
but is not cloven footed, nor cheweth 
the cud, is unclean unto you; every one 
that to toucheth them shall be unclean. 
27And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, 
among all beasts that go on all fours, 


they are unclean unto you; whoso 
toucheth their carcass shall be unclean 
until the even. 28And he that beareth 
the carcass of them shall wash his 
clothes, and be unclean until the even; 
they are unclean unto you. 

29And these are they which are 
unclean unto you among the swarming 
things that swarm upon the earth: the 
weasel, and the mouse, and the great 
lizard after its kinds, 30and the gecko, 
and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, 
and the sand-lizard, and the 
chameleon. 31These are they which are 
unclean to you among all that swarm; 
whosoever doth touch them, when 
they are dead, shall be unclean until 
the even. 32And upon whatsoever any 
of them, when they are dead, doth fall, 
it shall be unclean; whether it be any 
vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or 
sack, whatsoever vessel it be, 
wherewith any work is done, it must 
be put into water, and it shall be 
unclean until the even; then shall it be 
clean. 33And every earthen vessel 
whereinto any of them falleth, 
whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, 
and it ye shall break. 34All food therein 
which may be eaten, that on which 
water cometh, shall be unclean; and all 
drink in every such vessel that may be 
drunk shall be unclean. 35And every 
thing whereupon any part of their 
carcass falleth shall be unclean; 
whether oven, or range for pots, it 
shall be broken in pieces; they are 
unclean, and shall be unclean unto 
you. 36Nevertheless a fountain or a 
cistern wherein is a gathering of water 
shall be clean; but he who toucheth 
their carcass shall be unclean. 37And if 
aught of their carcass fall upon any 
sowing seed which is to be sown, it is 
clean. 38But if water be put upon the 
seed, and aught of their carcass fall 
thereon, it is unclean unto you. 

39And if any beast, of which ye may 
eat, die, he that toucheth the carcass 
thereof shall be unclean until the even. 
40And he that eateth of the carcass of it 
shall wash his clothes, and be unclean 
until the even; he also that beareth the 
carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and 
be unclean until the even. 

41And every swarming thing that 
swarmeth upon the earth is a 
detestable thing; it shall not be eaten. 
42Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, 
and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, 
or whatsoever hath many feet, even all 
swarming things that swarm upon the 
earth, them ye shall not eat; for they 
are a detestable thing. 43Ye shall not 
make yourselves detestable with any 
swarming thing that swarmeth, neither 
shall ye make yourselves unclean with 
them, that ye should be defiled 
thereby. 44For I am the LORD your God; 
sanctify yourselves therefore, and be 
ye holy; for I am holy; neither shall ye 
defile yourselves with any manner of 
swarming thing that moveth upon the 
earth. 45For I am the LORD that brought 
you up out of the land of Egypt, to be 
your God; ye shall therefore be holy, 
for I am holy. 


46This is the law of the beast, and of 
the fowl, and of every living creature 
that moveth in the waters, and of every 
creature that swarmeth upon the earth; 
47to make a difference between the 
unclean and the clean, and between the 
living thing that may be eaten and the 
living thing that may not be eaten. 


And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2Speak unto 
the children of Israel, saying: 

If a woman be delivered, and bear a 
man-child, then she shall be unclean 
seven days; as in the days of the 
impurity of her sickness shall she be 
unclean. 3And in the eighth day the 
flesh of his foreskin shall be 
circumcised. 4And she shall continue 
in the blood of purification three and 
thirty days; she shall touch no 
hallowed thing, nor come into the 
sanctuary, until the days of her 
purification be fulfilled. 5But if she 
bear a maid-child, then she shall be 
unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; 
and she shall continue in the blood of 
purification threescore and six days. 
6And when the days of her purification 
are fulfilled, for a son, or for a 
daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the 
first year for a burnt-offering, and a 
young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a 
sin-offering, unto the door of the tent 
of meeting, unto the priest. 7And he 
shall offer it before the LORD, and 
make atonement for her; and she shall 
be cleansed from the fountain of her 
blood. This is the law for her that 
beareth, whether a male or a female. 
8And if her means suffice not for a 
lamb, then she shall take two turtle-
doves, or two young pigeons: the one 
for a burnt-offering, and the other for a 
sin-offering; and the priest shall make 
atonement for her, and she shall be 
clean. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses and unto Aaron, 
saying: 

2When a man shall have in the skin 
of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a 
bright spot, and it become in the skin 
of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then 
he shall be brought unto Aaron the 
priest, or unto one of his sons the 
priests. 3And the priest shall look upon 
the plague in the skin of the flesh; and 
if the hair in the plague be turned 
white, and the appearance of the 
plague be deeper than the skin of his 
flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and 
the priest shall look on him, and 
pronounce him unclean. 4And if the 
bright spot be white in the skin of his 
flesh, and the appearance thereof be 
not deeper than the skin, and the hair 
thereof be not turned white, then the 
priest shall shut up him that hath the 
plague seven days. 5And the priest 
shall look on him the seventh day; and, 
behold, if the plague stay in its 
appearance, and the plague be not 
spread in the skin, then the priest shall 
shut him up seven days more. 6And the 
priest shall look on him again the 
seventh day; and, behold, if the plague 
12 

13 




be dim, and the plague be not spread in 
the skin, then the priest shall 
pronounce him clean: it is a scab; and 
he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 
7But if the scab spread abroad in the 
skin, after that he hath shown himself 
to the priest for his cleansing, he shall 
show himself to the priest again. 8And 
the priest shall look, and, behold, if the 
scab be spread in the skin, then the 
priest shall pronounce him unclean: it 
is leprosy. 

9When the plague of leprosy is in a 
man, then he shall be brought unto the 
priest. 10And the priest shall look, and, 
behold, if there be a white rising in the 
skin, and it have turned the hair white, 
and there be quick raw flesh in the 
rising, 11it is an old leprosy in the skin 
of his flesh, and the priest shall 
pronounce him unclean; he shall not 
shut him up; for he is unclean. 12And if 
the leprosy break out abroad in the 
skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin 
of him that hath the plague from his 
head even to his feet, as far as 
appeareth to the priest; 13then the priest 
shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy 
have covered all his flesh, he shall 
pronounce him clean that hath the 
plague; it is all turned white: he is 
clean. 14But whensoever raw flesh 
appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. 
15And the priest shall look on the raw 
flesh, and pronounce him unclean; the 
raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy. 
16But if the raw flesh again be turned 
into white, then he shall come unto the 
priest; 17and the priest shall look on 
him; and, behold, if the plague be 
turned into white, then the priest shall 
pronounce him clean that hath the 
plague: he is clean. 

18And when the flesh hath in the 
skin thereof a boil, and it is healed, 
19and in the place of the boil there is a 
white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-
white, then it shall be shown to the 
priest. 20And the priest shall look; and, 
behold, if the appearance thereof be 
lower than the skin, and the hair 
thereof be turned white, then the priest 
shall pronounce him unclean: it is the 
plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in 
the boil. 21But if the priest look on it, 
and, behold, there be no white hairs 
therein, and it be not lower than the 
skin, but be dim, then the priest shall 
shut him up seven days. 22And if it 
spread abroad in the skin, then the 
priest shall pronounce him unclean: it 
is a plague. 23But if the bright spot stay 
in its place, and be not spread, it is the 
scar of the boil; and the priest shall 
pronounce him clean. 

24Or when the flesh hath in the skin 
thereof a burning by fire, and the quick 
flesh of the burning become a bright 
spot, reddish-white, or white; 25then 
the priest shall look upon it; and, 
behold, if the hair in the bright spot be 
turned white, and the appearance 
thereof be deeper than the skin, it is 
leprosy, it hath broken out in the 
burning; and the priest shall pronounce 
him unclean: it is the plague of 
leprosy. 26But if the priest look on it, 
and, behold, there be no white hair in 


the bright spot, and it be no lower than 
the skin, but be dim; then the priest 
shall shut him up seven days. 27And 
the priest shall look upon him the 
seventh day; if it spread abroad in the 
skin, then the priest shall pronounce 
him unclean: it is the plague of 
leprosy. 28And if the bright spot stay in 
its place, and be not spread in the skin, 
but be dim, it is the rising of the 
burning, and the priest shall pronounce 
him clean; for it is the scar of the 
burning. 

29And when a man or woman hath a 
plague upon the head or upon the 
beard, 30then the priest shall look on 
the plague; and, behold, if the 
appearance thereof be deeper than the 
skin, and there be in it yellow thin 
hair, then the priest shall pronounce 
him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy 
of the head or of the beard. 31And if 
the priest look on the plague of the 
scall, and, behold, the appearance 
thereof be not deeper than the skin, 
and there be no black hair in it, then 
the priest shall shut up him that hath 
the plague of the scall seven days. 
32And in the seventh day the priest 
shall look on the plague; and, behold, 
if the scall be not spread, and there be 
in it no yellow hair, and the 
appearance of the scall be not deeper 
than the skin, 33then he shall be 
shaven, but the scall shall he not 
shave; and the priest shall shut up him 
that hath the scall seven days more. 
34And in the seventh day the priest 
shall look on the scall; and, behold, if 
the scall be not spread in the skin, and 
the appearance thereof be not deeper 
than the skin, then the priest shall 
pronounce him clean; and he shall 
wash his clothes, and be clean. 35But if 
the scall spread abroad in the skin after 
his cleansing, 36then the priest shall 
look on him; and, behold, if the scall 
be spread in the skin, the priest shall 
not seek for the yellow hair: he is 
unclean. 37But if the scall stay in its 
appearance, and black hair be grown 
up therein; the scall is healed, he is 
clean; and the priest shall pronounce 
him clean. 

38And if a man or a woman have in 
the skin of their flesh bright spots, 
even white bright spots; 39then the 
priest shall look; and, behold, if the 
bright spots in the skin of their flesh be 
of a dull white, it is a tetter, it hath 
broken out in the skin: he is clean. 

40And if a man’s hair be fallen off 
his head, he is bald; yet is he clean. 
41And if his hair be fallen off from the 
front part of his head, he is forehead-
bald; yet is he clean. 42But if there be 
in the bald head, or the bald forehead, 
a reddish-white plague, it is leprosy 
breaking out in his bald head, or his 
bald forehead. 43Then the priest shall 
look upon him; and, behold, if the 
rising of the plague be reddish-white 
in his bald head, or in his bald 
forehead, as the appearance of leprosy 
in the skin of the flesh, 44he is a 
leprous man, he is unclean; the priest 
shall surely pronounce him unclean: 
his plague is in his head. 


45And the leper in whom the plague 
is, his clothes shall be rent, and the 
hair of his head shall go loose, and he 
shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry: 
‘Unclean, unclean.’ 46All the days 
wherein the plague is in him he shall 
be unclean; he is unclean; he shall 
dwell alone; without the camp shall his 
dwelling be. 

47And when the plague of leprosy is 
in a garment, whether it be a woolen 
garment, or a linen garment; 48or in the 
warp, or in the woof, whether they be 
of linen, or of wool; or in a skin, or in 
any thing made of skin. 49If the plague 
be greenish or reddish in the garment, 
or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the 
woof, or in any thing of skin, it is the 
plague of leprosy, and shall be shown 
unto the priest. 50And the priest shall 
look upon the plague, and shut up that 
which hath the plague seven days. 
51And he shall look on the plague on 
the seventh day: if the plague be 
spread in the garment, or in the warp, 
or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever 
service skin is used for, the plague is a 
malignant leprosy: it is unclean. 52And 
he shall burn the garment, or the warp, 
or the woof, whether it be of wool or 
of linen, or any thing of skin, wherein 
the plague is; for it is a malignant 
leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. 
53And if the priest shall look, and, 
behold, the plague be not spread in the 
garment, or in the warp, or in the 
woof, or in any thing of skin; 54then 
the priest shall command that they 
wash the thing wherein the plague is, 
and he shall shut it up seven days 
more. 55And the priest shall look, after 
that the plague is washed; and, behold, 
if the plague have not changed its 
colour, and the plague be not spread, it 
is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the 
fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness 
be within or without. 56And if the 
priest look, and, behold, the plague be 
dim after the washing thereof, then he 
shall rend it out of the garment, or out 
of the skin, or out of the warp, or out 
of the woof. 57And if it appear still in 
the garment, or in the warp, or in the 
woof, or in any thing of skin, it is 
breaking out, thou shalt burn that 
wherein the plague is with fire. 58And 
the garment, or the warp, or the woof, 
or whatsoever thing of skin it be, 
which thou shalt wash, if the plague be 
departed from them, then it shall be 
washed the second time, and shall be 
clean. 59This is the law of the plague of 
leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, 
or in the warp, or in the woof, or in 
any thing of skin, to pronounce it 
clean, or to pronounce it unclean. 

 


And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 

2This shall be the law of the leper in 
the day of his cleansing: he shall be 
brought unto the priest. 3And the priest 
shall go forth out of the camp; and the 
priest shall look, and, behold, if the 
plague of leprosy be healed in the 
leper; 4then shall the priest command 
to take for him that is to be cleansed 
14 




two living clean birds, and cedar-
wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. 5And 
the priest shall command to kill one of 
the birds in an earthen vessel over 
running water. 6As for the living bird, 
he shall take it, and the cedar-wood, 
and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and 
shall dip them and the living bird in 
the blood of the bird that was killed 
over the running water. 7And he shall 
sprinkle upon him that is to be 
cleansed from the leprosy seven times, 
and shall pronounce him clean, and 
shall let go the living bird into the 
open field. 8And he that is to be 
cleansed shall wash his clothes, and 
shave off all his hair, and bathe 
himself in water, and he shall be clean; 
and after that he may come into the 
camp, but shall dwell outside his tent 
seven days. 9And it shall be on the 
seventh day, that he shall shave all his 
hair off his head and his beard and his 
eyebrows, even all his hair he shall 
shave off; and he shall wash his 
clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in 
water, and he shall be clean. 10And on 
the eighth day he shall take two he-
lambs without blemish, and one ewe-
lamb of the first year without blemish, 
and three tenth parts of an ephah of 
fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled 
with oil, and one log of oil. 11And the 
priest that cleanseth him shall set the 
man that is to be cleansed, and those 
things, before the LORD, at the door of 
the tent of meeting. 12And the priest 
shall take one of the he-lambs, and 
offer him for a guilt-offering, and the 
log of oil, and wave them for a wave-
offering before the LORD. 13And he 
shall kill the he-lamb in the place 
where they kill the sin-offering and the 
burnt-offering, in the place of the 
sanctuary; for as the sin-offering is the 
priest’s, so is the guilt-offering; it is 
most holy. 14And the priest shall take 
of the blood of the guilt-offering, and 
the priest shall put it upon the tip of 
the right ear of him that is to be 
cleansed, and upon the thumb of his 
right hand, and upon the great toe of 
his right foot. 15And the priest shall 
take of the log of oil, and pour it into 
the palm of his own left hand. 16And 
the priest shall dip his right finger in 
the oil that is in his left hand, and shall 
sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven 
times before the LORD. 17And of the 
rest of the oil that is in his hand shall 
the priest put upon the tip of the right 
ear of him that is to be cleansed, and 
upon the thumb of his right hand, and 
upon the great toe of his right foot, 
upon the blood of the guilt-offering. 
18And the rest of the oil that is in the 
priest’s hand he shall put upon the 
head of him that is to be cleansed; and 
the priest shall make atonement for 
him before the LORD. 19And the priest 
shall offer the sin-offering, and make 
atonement for him that is to be 
cleansed because of his uncleanness; 
and afterward he shall kill the burnt-
offering. 20And the priest shall offer 
the burnt-offering and the meal-
offering upon the altar; and the priest 


shall make atonement for him, and he 
shall be clean. 

21And if he be poor, and his means 
suffice not, then he shall take one he-
lamb for a guilt-offering to be waved, 
to make atonement for him, and one 
tenth part of an ephah of fine flour 
mingled with oil for a meal-offering, 
and a log of oil; 22and two turtle-doves, 
or two young pigeons, such as his 
means suffice for; and the one shall be 
a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-
offering. 23And on the eighth day he 
shall bring them for his cleansing unto 
the priest, unto the door of the tent of 
meeting, before the LORD. 24And the 
priest shall take the lamb of the guilt-
offering, and the log of oil, and the 
priest shall wave them for a wave-
offering before the LORD. 25And he 
shall kill the lamb of the guilt-offering, 
and the priest shall take of the blood of 
the guilt-offering, and put it upon the 
tip of the right ear of him that is to be 
cleansed, and upon the thumb of his 
right hand, and upon the great toe of 
his right foot. 26And the priest shall 
pour of the oil into the palm of his own 
left hand. 27And the priest shall 
sprinkle with his right finger some of 
the oil that is in his left hand seven 
times before the LORD. 28And the priest 
shall put of the oil that is in his hand 
upon the tip of the right ear of him that 
is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb 
of his right hand, and upon the great 
toe of his right foot, upon the place of 
the blood of the guilt-offering. 29And 
the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s 
hand he shall put upon the head of him 
that is to be cleansed, to make 
atonement for him before the LORD. 
30And he shall offer one of the turtle-
doves, or of the young pigeons, such 
as his means suffice for; 31even such as 
his means suffice for, the one for a sin-
offering, and the other for a burnt-
offering, with the meal-offering; and 
the priest shall make atonement for 
him that is to be cleansed before the 
LORD. 32This is the law of him in whom 
is the plague of leprosy, whose means 
suffice not for that which pertaineth to 
his cleansing. 

33And the LORD spoke unto Moses 
and unto Aaron, saying: 

34When ye are come into the land of 
Canaan, which I give to you for a 
possession, and I put the plague of 
leprosy in a house of the land of your 
possession; 35then he that owneth the 
house shall come and tell the priest, 
saying: ‘There seemeth to me to be as 
it were a plague in the house.’ 36And 
the priest shall command that they 
empty the house, before the priest go 
in to see the plague, that all that is in 
the house be not made unclean; and 
afterward the priest shall go in to see 
the house. 37And he shall look on the 
plague, and, behold, if the plague be in 
the walls of the house with hollow 
streaks, greenish or reddish, and the 
appearance thereof be lower than the 
wall; 38then the priest shall go out of 
the house to the door of the house, and 
shut up the house seven days. 39And 
the priest shall come again the seventh 


day, and shall look; and, behold, if the 
plague be spread in the walls of the 
house; 40then the priest shall command 
that they take out the stones in which 
the plague is, and cast them into an 
unclean place without the city. 41And 
he shall cause the house to be scraped 
within round about, and they shall 
pour out the mortar that they scrape off 
without the city into an unclean place. 
42And they shall take other stones, and 
put them in the place of those stones; 
and he shall take other mortar, and 
shall plaster the house. 43And if the 
plague come again, and break out in 
the house, after that the stones have 
been taken out, and after the house 
hath been scraped, and after it is 
plastered; 44then the priest shall come 
in and look; and, behold, if the plague 
be spread in the house, it is a 
malignant leprosy in the house: it is 
unclean. 45And he shall break down 
the house, the stones of it, and the 
timber thereof, and all the mortar of 
the house; and he shall carry them 
forth out of the city into an unclean 
place. 46Moreover he that goeth into 
the house all the while that it is shut up 
shall be unclean until the even. 47And 
he that lieth in the house shall wash his 
clothes; and he that eateth in the house 
shall wash his clothes. 48And if the 
priest shall come in, and look, and, 
behold, the plague hath not spread in 
the house, after the house was 
plastered; then the priest shall 
pronounce the house clean, because 
the plague is healed. 49And he shall 
take to cleanse the house two birds, 
and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and 
hyssop. 50And he shall kill one of the 
birds in an earthen vessel over running 
water. 51And he shall take the cedar-
wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, 
and the living bird, and dip them in the 
blood of the slain bird, and in the 
running water, and sprinkle the house 
seven times. 52And he shall cleanse the 
house with the blood of the bird, and 
with the running water, and with the 
living bird, and with the cedar-wood, 
and with the hyssop, and with the 
scarlet. 53But he shall let go the living 
bird out of the city into the open field; 
so shall he make atonement for the 
house; and it shall be clean. 

54This is the law for all manner of 
plague of leprosy, and for a scall; 55and 
for the leprosy of a garment, and for a 
house; 56and for a rising, and for a 
scab, and for a bright spot; 57to teach 
when it is unclean, and when it is 
clean; this is the law of leprosy. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses and to Aaron, saying: 
2Speak unto the children of Israel, and 
say unto them: 

When any man hath an issue out of 
his flesh, his issue is unclean. 3And 
this shall be his uncleanness in his 
issue: whether his flesh run with his 
issue, or his flesh be stopped from his 
issue, it is his uncleanness. 4Every bed 
whereon he that hath the issue lieth 
shall be unclean; and every thing 
whereon he sitteth shall be unclean. 
15 




5And whosoever toucheth his bed shall 
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in 
water, and be unclean until the even. 
6And he that sitteth on any thing 
whereon he that hath the issue sat shall 
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in 
water, and be unclean until the even. 
7And he that toucheth the flesh of him 
that hath the issue shall wash his 
clothes, and bathe himself in water, 
and be unclean until the even. 8And if 
he that hath the issue spit upon him 
that is clean, then he shall wash his 
clothes, and bathe himself in water, 
and be unclean until the even. 9And 
what saddle soever he that hath the 
issue rideth upon shall be unclean. 
10And whosoever toucheth any thing 
that was under him shall be unclean 
until the even; and he that beareth 
those things shall wash his clothes, and 
bathe himself in water, and be unclean 
until the even. 11And whomsoever he 
that hath the issue toucheth, without 
having rinsed his hands in water, he 
shall wash his clothes, and bathe 
himself in water, and be unclean until 
the even. 12And the earthen vessel, 
which he that hath the issue toucheth, 
shall be broken; and every vessel of 
wood shall be rinsed in water. 13And 
when he that hath an issue is cleansed 
of his issue, then he shall number to 
himself seven days for his cleansing, 
and wash his clothes; and he shall 
bathe his flesh in running water, and 
shall be clean. 14And on the eighth day 
he shall take to him two turtle-doves, 
or two young pigeons, and come 
before the LORD unto the door of the 
tent of meeting, and give them unto 
the priest. 15And the priest shall offer 
them, the one for a sin-offering, and 
the other for a burnt-offering; and the 
priest shall make atonement for him 
before the LORD for his issue. 

16And if the flow of seed go out 
from a man, then he shall bathe all his 
flesh in water, and be unclean until the 
even. 17And every garment, and every 
skin, whereon is the flow of seed, shall 
be washed with water, and be unclean 
until the even. 18The woman also with 
whom a man shall lie carnally, they 
shall both bathe themselves in water, 
and be unclean until the even. 

19And if a woman have an issue, and 
her issue in her flesh be blood, she 
shall be in her impurity seven days; 
and whosoever toucheth her shall be 
unclean until the even. 20And every 
thing that she lieth upon in her 
impurity shall be unclean; every thing 
also that she sitteth upon shall be 
unclean. 21And whosoever toucheth 
her bed shall wash his clothes, and 
bathe himself in water, and be unclean 
until the even. 22And whosoever 
toucheth any thing that she sitteth 
upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe 
himself in water, and be unclean until 
the even. 23And if he be on the bed, or 
on any thing whereon she sitteth, when 
he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until 
the even. 24And if any man lie with 
her, and her impurity be upon him, he 
shall be unclean seven days; and every 
bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean. 


25And if a woman have an issue of 
her blood many days not in the time of 
her impurity, or if she have an issue 
beyond the time of her impurity; all 
the days of the issue of her 
uncleanness she shall be as in the days 
of her impurity: she is unclean. 
26Every bed whereon she lieth all the 
days of her issue shall be unto her as 
the bed of her impurity; and every 
thing whereon she sitteth shall be 
unclean, as the uncleanness of her 
impurity. 27And whosoever toucheth 
those things shall be unclean, and shall 
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in 
water, and be unclean until the even. 
28But if she be cleansed of her issue, 
then she shall number to herself seven 
days, and after that she shall be clean. 
29And on the eighth day she shall take 
unto her two turtle-doves, or two 
young pigeons, and bring them unto 
the priest, to the door of the tent of 
meeting. 30And the priest shall offer 
the one for a sin-offering, and the 
other for a burnt-offering; and the 
priest shall make atonement for her 
before the LORD for the issue of her 
uncleanness. 

31Thus shall ye separate the children 
of Israel from their uncleanness; that 
they die not in their uncleanness, when 
they defile My tabernacle that is in the 
midst of them. 

32This is the law of him that hath an 
issue, and of him from whom the flow 
of seed goeth out, so that he is unclean 
thereby; 33and of her that is sick with 
her impurity, and of them that have an 
issue, whether it be a man, or a 
woman; and of him that lieth with her 
that is unclean. 

 


And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, after the death of the 
two sons of Aaron, when they drew 
near before the LORD, and died; 2and 
the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Speak unto 
Aaron thy brother, that he come not at 
all times into the holy place within the 
veil, before the ark-cover which is 
upon the ark; that he die not; for I 
appear in the cloud upon the ark-cover. 
3Herewith shall Aaron come into the 
holy place: with a young bullock for a 
sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-
offering. 4He shall put on the holy 
linen tunic, and he shall have the linen 
breeches upon his flesh, and shall be 
girded with the linen girdle, and with 
the linen mitre shall he be attired; they 
are the holy garments; and he shall 
bathe his flesh in water, and put them 
on. 5And he shall take of the 
congregation of the children of Israel 
two he-goats for a sin-offering, and 
one ram for a burnt-offering. 6And 
Aaron shall present the bullock of the 
sin-offering, which is for himself, and 
make atonement for himself, and for 
his house. 7And he shall take the two 
goats, and set them before the LORD at 
the door of the tent of meeting. 8And 
Aaron shall cast lots upon the two 
goats: one lot for the LORD, and the 
other lot for Azazel. 9And Aaron shall 
present the goat upon which the lot fell 
16 




for the LORD, and offer him for a sin-
offering. 10But the goat, on which the 
lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive 
before the LORD, to make atonement 
over him, to send him away for Azazel 
into the wilderness. 11And Aaron shall 
present the bullock of the sin-offering, 
which is for himself, and shall make 
atonement for himself, and for his 
house, and shall kill the bullock of the 
sin-offering which is for himself. 
12And he shall take a censer full of 
coals of fire from off the altar before 
the LORD, and his hands full of sweet 
incense beaten small, and bring it 
within the veil. 13And he shall put the 
incense upon the fire before the LORD, 
that the cloud of the incense may cover 
the ark-cover that is upon the 
testimony, that he die not. 14And he 
shall take of the blood of the bullock, 
and sprinkle it with his finger upon the 
ark-cover on the east; and before the 
ark-cover shall he sprinkle of the 
blood with his finger seven times. 
15Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-
offering, that is for the people, and 
bring his blood within the veil, and do 
with his blood as he did with the blood 
of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the 
ark-cover, and before the ark-cover. 
16And he shall make atonement for the 
holy place, because of the 
uncleannesses of the children of Israel, 
and because of their transgressions, 
even all their sins; and so shall he do 
for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth 
with them in the midst of their 
uncleannesses. 17And there shall be no 
man in the tent of meeting when he 
goeth in to make atonement in the holy 
place, until he come out, and have 
made atonement for himself, and for 
his household, and for all the assembly 
of Israel. 18And he shall go out unto 
the altar that is before the LORD, and 
make atonement for it; and shall take 
of the blood of the bullock, and of the 
blood of the goat, and put it upon the 
horns of the altar round about. 19And 
he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it 
with his finger seven times, and 
cleanse it, and hallow it from the 
uncleannesses of the children of Israel. 
20And when he hath made an end of 
atoning for the holy place, and the tent 
of meeting, and the altar, he shall 
present the live goat. 21And Aaron 
shall lay both his hands upon the head 
of the live goat, and confess over him 
all the iniquities of the children of 
Israel, and all their transgressions, 
even all their sins; and he shall put 
them upon the head of the goat, and 
shall send him away by the hand of an 
appointed man into the wilderness. 
22And the goat shall bear upon him all 
their iniquities unto a land which is cut 
off; and he shall let go the goat in the 
wilderness. 23And Aaron shall come 
into the tent of meeting, and shall put 
off the linen garments, which he put 
on when he went into the holy place, 
and shall leave them there. 24And he 
shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy 
place and put on his other vestments, 
and come forth, and offer his burnt-
offering and the burnt-offering of the 


people, and make atonement for 
himself and for the people. 25And the 
fat of the sin-offering shall he make 
smoke upon the altar. 26And he that 
letteth go the goat for Azazel shall 
wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in 
water, and afterward he may come into 
the camp. 27And the bullock of the sin-
offering, and the goat of the sin-
offering, whose blood was brought in 
to make atonement in the holy place, 
shall be carried forth without the 
camp; and they shall burn in the fire 
their skins, and their flesh, and their 
dung. 28And he that burneth them shall 
wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in 
water, and afterward he may come into 
the camp. 

29And it shall be a statute for ever unto 
you: in the seventh month, on the tenth 
day of the month, ye shall afflict your 
souls, and shall do no manner of work, 
the home-born, or the stranger that 
sojourneth among you. 30For on this 
day shall atonement be made for you, 
to cleanse you; from all your sins shall 
ye be clean before the LORD. 31It is a 
sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and 
ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute 
for ever. 32And the priest, who shall be 
anointed and who shall be consecrated 
to be priest in his father’s stead, shall 
make the atonement, and shall put on 
the linen garments, even the holy 
garments. 33And he shall make 
atonement for the most holy place, and 
he shall make atonement for the tent of 
meeting and for the altar; and he shall 
make atonement for the priests and for 
all the people of the assembly. 34And 
this shall be an everlasting statute unto 
you, to make atonement for the 
children of Israel because of all their 
sins once in the year.’ And he did as 
the LORD commanded Moses. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2Speak unto 
Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all 
the children of Israel, and say unto 
them: This is the thing which the LORD 
hath commanded, saying: 

3What man soever there be of the 
house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or 
lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that 
killeth it without the camp, 4and hath 
not brought it unto the door of the tent 
of meeting, to present it as an offering 
unto the LORD before the tabernacle of 
the LORD, blood shall be imputed unto 
that man; he hath shed blood; and that 
man shall be cut off from among his 
people. 5To the end that the children of 
Israel may bring their sacrifices, which 
they sacrifice in the open field, even 
that they may bring them unto the 
LORD, unto the door of the tent of 
meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice 
them for sacrifices of peace-offerings 
unto the LORD. 6And the priest shall 
dash the blood against the altar of the 
LORD at the door of the tent of meeting, 
and make the fat smoke for a sweet 
savour unto the LORD. 7And they shall 
no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto 
the satyrs, after whom they go astray. 
This shall be a statute for ever unto 
them throughout their generations. 
17 




8And thou shalt say unto them: 
Whatsoever man there be of the house 
of Israel, or of the strangers that 
sojourn among them, that offereth a 
burnt-offering or sacrifice, 9and 
bringeth it not unto the door of the tent 
of meeting, to sacrifice it unto the 
LORD, even that man shall be cut off 
from his people. 

10And whatsoever man there be of 
the house of Israel, or of the strangers 
that sojourn among them, that eateth 
any manner of blood, I will set My 
face against that soul that eateth blood, 
and will cut him off from among his 
people. 11For the life of the flesh is in 
the blood; and I have given it to you 
upon the altar to make atonement for 
your souls; for it is the blood that 
maketh atonement by reason of the 
life. 12Therefore I said unto the 
children of Israel: No soul of you shall 
eat blood, neither shall any stranger 
that sojourneth among you eat blood. 
13And whatsoever man there be of the 
children of Israel, or of the strangers 
that sojourn among them, that taketh in 
hunting any beast or fowl that may be 
eaten, he shall pour out the blood 
thereof, and cover it with dust. 14For as 
to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof 
is all one with the life thereof; 
therefore I said unto the children of 
Israel: Ye shall eat the blood of no 
manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh 
is the blood thereof; whosoever eateth 
it shall be cut off. 15And every soul 
that eateth that which dieth of itself, or 
that which is torn of beasts, whether he 
be home-born or a stranger, he shall 
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in 
water, and be unclean until the even; 
then shall he be clean. 16But if he wash 
them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he 
shall bear his iniquity. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2Speak unto 
the children of Israel, and say unto 
them: 

I am the LORD your God. 3After the 
doings of the land of Egypt, wherein 
ye dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the 
doings of the land of Canaan, whither I 
bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall 
ye walk in their statutes. 4Mine 
ordinances shall ye do, and My 
statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: 
I am the LORD your God. 5Ye shall 
therefore keep My statutes, and Mine 
ordinances, which if a man do, he shall 
live by them: I am the LORD. 

6None of you shall approach to any 
that is near of kin to him, to uncover 
their nakedness. I am the LORD. 

7The nakedness of thy father, and 
the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou 
not uncover: she is thy mother; thou 
shalt not uncover her nakedness. 

8The nakedness of thy father’s wife 
shalt thou not uncover: it is thy 
father’s nakedness. 

9The nakedness of thy sister, the 
daughter of thy father, or the daughter 
of thy mother, whether born at home, 
or born abroad, even their nakedness 
thou shalt not uncover. 
18 




10The nakedness of thy son’s 
daughter, or of thy daughter’s 
daughter, even their nakedness thou 
shalt not uncover; for theirs is thine 
own nakedness. 

11The nakedness of thy father’s 
wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father, 
she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover 
her nakedness. 

12Thou shalt not uncover the 
nakedness of thy father’s sister: she is 
thy father’s near kinswoman. 

13Thou shalt not uncover the 
nakedness of thy mother’s sister; for 
she is thy mother’s near kinswoman. 

14Thou shalt not uncover the 
nakedness of thy fathers brother, thou 
shalt not approach to his wife: she is 
thine aunt. 

15Thou shalt not uncover the 
nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she 
is thy son’wife; thou shalt not uncover 
her nakedness. 

16Thou shalt not uncover the 
nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it is 
thy brother’s nakedness. 17Thou shalt 
not uncover the nakedness of a woman 
and her daughter; thou shalt not take 
her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s 
daughter, to uncover her nakedness: 
they are near kinswomen; it is 
lewdness. 18And thou shalt not take a 
woman to her sister, to be a rival to 
her, to uncover her nakedness, beside 
the other in her lifetime. 19And thou 
shalt not approach unto a woman to 
uncover her nakedness, as long as she 
is impure by her uncleanness. 20And 
thou shalt not lie carnally with thy 
neighbour’s wife, to defile thyself with 
her. 21And thou shalt not give any of 
thy seed to set them apart to Molech, 
neither shalt thou profane the name of 
thy God: I am the LORD. 22Thou shalt 
not lie with mankind, as with 
womankind; it is abomination. 23And 
thou shalt not lie with any beast to 
defile thyself therewith; neither shall 
any woman stand before a beast, to lie 
down thereto; it is perversion. 

24Defile not ye yourselves in any of 
these things; for in all these the nations 
are defiled, which I cast out from 
before you. 25And the land was defiled, 
therefore I did visit the iniquity thereof 
upon it, and the land vomited out her 
inhabitants. 26Ye therefore shall keep 
My statutes and Mine ordinances, and 
shall not do any of these abominations; 
neither the home-born, nor the stranger 
that sojourneth among you— 27for all 
these abominations have the men of 
the land done, that were before you, 
and the land is defiled— 28that the land 
vomit not you out also, when ye defile 
it, as it vomited out the nation that was 
before you. 29For whosoever shall do 
any of these abominations, even the 
souls that do them shall be cut off 
from among their people. 30Therefore 
shall ye keep My charge, that ye do 
not any of these abominable customs, 
which were done before you, and that 
ye defile not yourselves therein: I am 
the LORD your God. 


And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2Speak unto all 19 




the congregation of the children of 
Israel, and say unto them: 

Ye shall be holy; for I the LORD your 
God am holy. 3Ye shall fear every man 
his mother, and his father, and ye shall 
keep My sabbaths: I am the LORD your 
God. 4Turn ye not unto the idols, nor 
make to yourselves molten gods: I am 
the LORD your God. 

5And when ye offer a sacrifice of 
peace-offerings unto the LORD, ye shall 
offer it that ye may be accepted. 6It 
shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, 
and on the morrow; and if aught 
remain until the third day, it shall be 
burnt with fire. 7And if it be eaten at 
all on the third day, it is a vile thing; it 
shall not be accepted. 8But every one 
that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, 
because he hath profaned the holy 
thing of the LORD; and that soul shall 
be cut off from his people. 

9And when ye reap the harvest of 
your land, thou shalt not wholly reap 
the corner of thy field, neither shalt 
thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest. 
10And thou shalt not glean thy 
vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the 
fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt 
leave them for the poor and for the 
stranger: I am the LORD your God. 11Ye 
shall not steal; neither shall ye deal 
falsely, nor lie one to another. 12And 
ye shall not swear by My name falsely, 
so that thou profane the name of thy 
God: I am the LORD. 13Thou shalt not 
oppress thy neighbour, nor rob him; 
the wages of a hired servant shall not 
abide with thee all night until the 
morning. 14Thou shalt not curse the 
deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before 
the blind, but thou shalt fear thy God: I 
am the LORD. 15Ye shall do no 
unrighteousness in judgment; thou 
shalt not respect the person of the 
poor, nor favour the person of the 
mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou 
judge thy neighbour. 16Thou shalt not 
go up and down as a talebearer among 
thy people; neither shalt thou stand 
idly by the blood of thy neighbour: I 
am the LORD. 17Thou shalt not hate thy 
brother in thy heart; thou shalt surely 
rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin 
because of him. 18Thou shalt not take 
vengeance, nor bear any grudge 
against the children of thy people, but 
thou shalt love thy neighbour as 
thyself: I am the LORD. 19Ye shall keep 
My statutes. Thou shalt not let thy 
cattle gender with a diverse kind; thou 
shalt not sow thy field with two kinds 
of seed; neither shall there come upon 
thee a garment of two kinds of stuff 
mingled together. 20And whosoever 
lieth carnally with a woman, that is a 
bondmaid, designated for a man, and 
not at all redeemed, nor was freedom 
given her; there shall be inquisition; 
they shall not be put to death, because 
she was not free. 21And he shall bring 
his forfeit unto the LORD, unto the door 
of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a 
guilt-offering. 22And the priest shall 
make atonement for him with the ram 
of the guilt-offering before the LORD 
for his sin which he hath sinned; and 


he shall be forgiven for his sin which 
he hath sinned. 

23And when ye shall come into the 
land, and shall have planted all manner 
of trees for food, then ye shall count 
the fruit thereof as forbidden; three 
years shall it be as forbidden unto you; 
it shall not be eaten. 24And in the 
fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be 
holy, for giving praise unto the LORD. 
25But in the fifth year may ye eat of the 
fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you 
more richly the increase thereof: I am 
the LORD your God. 26Ye shall not eat 
with the blood; neither shall ye 
practise divination nor soothsaying. 
27Ye shall not round the corners of 
your heads, neither shalt thou mar the 
corners of thy beard. 28Ye shall not 
make any cuttings in your flesh for the 
dead, nor imprint any marks upon you: 
I am the LORD. 29Profane not thy 
daughter, to make her a harlot, lest the 
land fall into harlotry, and the land 
become full of lewdness. 30Ye shall 
keep My sabbaths, and reverence My 
sanctuary: I am the LORD. 31Turn ye 
not unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar 
spirits; seek them not out, to be defiled 
by them: I am the LORD your God. 
32Thou shalt rise up before the hoary 
head, and honour the face of the old 
man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am 
the LORD. 33And if a stranger sojourn 
with thee in your land, ye shall not do 
him wrong. 34The stranger that 
sojourneth with you shall be unto you 
as the home-born among you, and thou 
shalt love him as thyself; for ye were 
strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the 
LORD your God. 35Ye shall do no 
unrighteousness in judgment, in 
meteyard, in weight, or in measure. 
36Just balances, just weights, a just 
ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I 
am the LORD your God, who brought 
you out of the land of Egypt. 37And ye 
shall observe all My statutes, and all 
Mine ordinances, and do them: I am 
the LORD. 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2Moreover, 
thou shalt say to the children of Israel: 

Whosoever he be of the children of 
Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn 
in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto 
Molech; he shall surely be put to 
death; the people of the land shall 
stone him with stones. 3I also will set 
My face against that man, and will cut 
him off from among his people, 
because he hath given of his seed unto 
Molech, to defile My sanctuary, and to 
profane My holy name. 4And if the 
people of the land do at all hide their 
eyes from that man, when he giveth of 
his seed unto Molech, and put him not 
to death; 5then I will set My face 
against that man, and against his 
family, and will cut him off, and all 
that go astray after him, to go astray 
after Molech, from among their 
people. 6And the soul that turneth unto 
the ghosts, and unto the familiar 
spirits, to go astray after them, I will 
even set My face against that soul, and 
will cut him off from among his 
people. 7Sanctify yourselves therefore, 
20 




and be ye holy; for I am the LORD your 
God. 8And keep ye My statutes, and do 
them: I am the LORD who sanctify you. 
9For whatsoever man there be that 
curseth his father or his mother shall 
surely be put to death; he hath cursed 
his father or his mother; his blood shall 
be upon him. 10And the man that 
committeth adultery with another 
man’s wife, even he that committeth 
adultery with his neighbour’s wife, 
both the adulterer and the adulteress 
shall surely be put to death. 11And the 
man that lieth with his father’s wife—
he hath uncovered his father’s 
nakedness—both of them shall surely 
be put to death; their blood shall be 
upon them. 12And if a man lie with his 
daughter-in-law, both of them shall 
surely be put to death; they have 
wrought corruption; their blood shall 
be upon them. 13And if a man lie with 
mankind, as with womankind, both of 
them have committed abomination: 
they shall surely be put to death; their 
blood shall be upon them. 14And if a 
man take with his wife also her 
mother, it is wickedness: they shall be 
burnt with fire, both he and they; that 
there be no wickedness among you. 
15And if a man lie with a beast, he 
shall surely be put to death; and ye 
shall slay the beast. 16And if a woman 
approach unto any beast, and lie down 
thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and 
the beast: they shall surely be put to 
death; their blood shall be upon them. 
17And if a man shall take his sister, his 
father’s daughter, or his mother’s 
daughter, and see her nakedness, and 
she see his nakedness: it is a shameful 
thing; and they shall be cut off in the 
sight of the children of their people: he 
hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; 
he shall bear his iniquity. 18And if a 
man shall lie with a woman having her 
sickness, and shall uncover her 
nakedness—he hath made naked her 
fountain, and she hath uncovered the 
fountain of her blood—both of them 
shall be cut off from among their 
people. 19And thou shalt not uncover 
the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, 
nor of thy father’s sister; for he hath 
made naked his near kin; they shall 
bear their iniquity. 20And if a man shall 
lie with his uncle’s wife—he hath 
uncovered his uncle’s nakedness—
they shall bear their sin; they shall die 
childless. 21And if a man shall take his 
brother’s wife, it is impurity: he hath 
uncovered his brother’s nakedness; 
they shall be childless. 

22Ye shall therefore keep all My 
statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and 
do them, that the land, whither I bring 
you to dwell therein, vomit you not 
out. 23And ye shall not walk in the 
customs of the nation, which I am 
casting out before you; for they did all 
these things, and therefore I abhorred 
them. 24But I have said unto you: ‘Ye 
shall inherit their land, and I will give 
it unto you to possess it, a land flowing 
with milk and honey.’ I am the LORD 
your God, who have set you apart 
from the peoples. 25Ye shall therefore 
separate between the clean beast and 


the unclean, and between the unclean 
fowl and the clean; and ye shall not 
make your souls detestable by beast, or 
by fowl, or by any thing wherewith the 
ground teemeth, which I have set apart 
for you to hold unclean. 26And ye shall 
be holy unto Me; for I the LORD am 
holy, and have set you apart from the 
peoples, that ye should be Mine. 

27A man also or a woman that 
divineth by a ghost or a familiar spirit, 
shall surely be put to death; they shall 
stone them with stones; their blood 
shall be upon them. 

 


And the LORD said unto 
Moses: Speak unto the priests 
the sons of Aaron, and say unto them: 

There shall none defile himself for 
the dead among his people; 2except for 
his kin, that is near unto him, for his 
mother, and for his father, and for his 
son, and for his daughter, and for his 
brother; 3and for his sister a virgin, that 
is near unto him, that hath had no 
husband, for her may he defile 
himself. 4He shall not defile himself, 
being a chief man among his people, 
to profane himself. 5They shall not 
make baldness upon their head, neither 
shall they shave off the corners of their 
beard, nor make any cuttings in their 
flesh. 6They shall be holy unto their 
God, and not profane the name of their 
God; for the offerings of the LORD 
made by fire, the bread of their God, 
they do offer; therefore they shall be 
holy. 7They shall not take a woman 
that is a harlot, or profaned; neither 
shall they take a woman put away 
from her husband; for he is holy unto 
his God. 8Thou shalt sanctify him 
therefore; for he offereth the bread of 
thy God; he shall be holy unto thee; 
for I the LORD, who sanctify you, am 
holy. 9And the daughter of any priest, 
if she profane herself by playing the 
harlot, she profaneth her father: she 
shall be burnt with fire. 

10And the priest that is highest 
among his brethren, upon whose head 
the anointing oil is poured, and that is 
consecrated to put on the garments, 
shall not let the hair of his head go 
loose, nor rend his clothes; 11neither 
shall he go in to any dead body, nor 
defile himself for his father, or for his 
mother; 12neither shall he go out of the 
sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of 
his God; for the consecration of the 
anointing oil of his God is upon him: I 
am the LORD. 13And he shall take a 
wife in her virginity. 14A widow, or 
one divorced, or a profaned woman, or 
a harlot, these shall he not take; but a 
virgin of his own people shall he take 
to wife. 15And he shall not profane his 
seed among his people; for I am the 
LORD who sanctify him. 

16And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 17Speak unto Aaron, saying: 

Whosoever he be of thy seed 
throughout their generations that hath 
a blemish, let him not approach to 
offer the bread of his God. 18For 
whatsoever man he be that hath a 
blemish, he shall not approach: a blind 
21 




man, or a lame, or he that hath any 
thing maimed, or anything too long, 
19or a man that is broken-footed, or 
broken-handed, 20or crook-backed, or a 
dwarf, or that hath his eye overspread, 
or is scabbed, or scurvy, or hath his 
stones crushed; 21no man of the seed of 
Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, 
shall come nigh to offer the offerings 
of the LORD made by fire; he hath a 
blemish; he shall not come nigh to 
offer the bread of his God. 22He may 
eat the bread of his God, both of the 
most holy, and of the holy. 23Only he 
shall not go in unto the veil, nor come 
nigh unto the altar, because he hath a 
blemish; that he profane not My holy 
places; for I am the LORD who sanctify 
them. 

24So Moses spoke unto Aaron, and 
to his sons, and unto all the children of 
Israel. 

22 



And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2Speak unto 
Aaron and to his sons, that they 
separate themselves from the holy 
things of the children of Israel, which 
they hallow unto Me, and that they 
profane not My holy name: I am the 
LORD. 3Say unto them: 

Whosoever he be of all your seed 
throughout your generations, that 
approacheth unto the holy things, 
which the children of Israel hallow 
unto the LORD, having his uncleanness 
upon him, that soul shall be cut off 
from before Me: I am the LORD. 4What 
man soever of the seed of Aaron is a 
leper, or hath an issue, he shall not eat 
of the holy things, until he be clean. 
And whoso toucheth any one that is 
unclean by the dead; or from 
whomsoever the flow of seed goeth 
out; 5or whosoever toucheth any 
swarming thing, whereby he may be 
made unclean, or a man of whom he 
may take uncleanness, whatsoever 
uncleanness he hath; 6the soul that 
toucheth any such shall be unclean 
until the even, and shall not eat of the 
holy things, unless he bathe his flesh 
in water. 7And when the sun is down, 
he shall be clean; and afterward he 
may eat of the holy things, because it 
is his bread. 8That which dieth of 
itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not 
eat to defile himself therewith: I am 
the LORD. 9They shall therefore keep 
My charge, lest they bear sin for it, 
and die therein, if they profane it: I am 
the LORD who sanctify them. 10There 
shall no acommon man eat of the holy 
thing; a tenant of a priest, or a hired 
servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. 
11But if a priest buy any soul, the 
purchase of his money, he may eat of 
it; and such as are born in his house, 
they may eat of his bread. 12And if a 
priest’s daughter be married unto a 
common man, she shall not eat of that 
which is set apart from the holy things. 
13But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, 
or divorced, and have no child, and is 
returned unto her father’s house, as in 
her youth, she may eat of her father’s 
bread; but there shall no common man 

a That is, one who is not a priest. 


eat thereof. 14And if a man eat of the 
holy thing through error, then he shall 
put the fifth part thereof unto it, and 
shall give unto the priest the holy 
thing. 15And they shall not profane the 
holy things of the children of Israel, 
which they set apart unto the LORD; 
16and so cause them to bear the 
iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they 
eat their holy things; for I am the LORD 
who sanctify them. 

17And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 18Speak unto Aaron, and to his 
sons, and unto all the children of 
Israel, and say unto them: 

Whosoever he be of the house of 
Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that 
bringeth his offering, whether it be any 
of their vows, or any of their free-will-
offerings, which are brought unto the 
LORD for a burnt-offering; 19that ye 
may be accepted, ye shall offer a male 
without blemish, of the beeves, of the 
sheep, or of the goats. 20But 
whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall 
ye not bring; for it shall not be 
acceptable for you. 21And whosoever 
bringeth a sacrifice of peace-offerings 
unto the LORD in fulfilment of a vow 
clearly uttered, or for a freewill-
offering, of the herd or of the flock, it 
shall be perfect to be accepted; there 
shall be no blemish therein. 22Blind, or 
broken, or maimed, or having a wen, 
or scabbed, or scurvy, ye shall not 
offer these unto the LORD, nor make an 
offering by fire of them upon the altar 
unto the LORD. 23Either a bullock or a 
lamb that hath any thing too long or 
too short, that mayest thou offer for a 
freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall 
not be accepted. 24That which hath its 
stones bruised, or crushed, or torn, or 
cut, ye shall not offer unto the LORD; 
neither shall ye do thus in your land. 
25Neither from the hand of a foreigner 
shall ye offer the bread of your God of 
any of these, because their corruption 
is in them, there is a blemish in them; 
they shall not be accepted for you. 

26And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 

27When a bullock, or a sheep, or a 
goat, is brought forth, then it shall be 
seven days under the dam; but from 
the eighth day and thenceforth it may 
be accepted for an offering made by 
fire unto the LORD. 28And whether it be 
cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its 
young both in one day. 29And when ye 
sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving 
unto the LORD, ye shall sacrifice it that 
ye may be accepted. 30On the same day 
it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of 
it until the morning: I am the LORD. 
31And ye shall keep My 
commandments, and do them: I am the 
LORD. 32And ye shall not profane My 
holy name; but I will be hallowed 
among the children of Israel: I am the 
LORD who hallow you, 33that brought 
you out of the land of Egypt, to be 
your God: I am the LORD. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2Speak unto 
the children of Israel, and say unto 
them: 
23 




The appointed seasons of the LORD, 
which ye shall proclaim to be holy 
convocations, even these are My 
appointed seasons. 3Six days shall 
work be done; but on the seventh day 
is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy 
convocation; ye shall do no manner of 
work; it is a sabbath unto the LORD in 
all your dwellings. 

4These are the appointed seasons of 
the LORD, even holy convocations, 
which ye shall proclaim in their 
appointed season. 5In the first month, 
on the fourteenth day of the month at 
dusk, is the LORD’S passover. 6And on 
the fifteenth day of the same month is 
the feast of unleavened bread unto the 
LORD; seven days ye shall eat 
unleavened bread. 7In the first day ye 
shall have a holy convocation; ye shall 
do no manner of servile work. 8And ye 
shall bring an offering made by fire 
unto the LORD seven days; in the 
seventh day is a holy convocation; ye 
shall do no manner of servile work. 

9And the LORD spoke unto Moses 
saying: 10Speak unto the children of 
Israel, and say unto them: 

When ye are come into the land 
which I give unto you, and shall reap 
the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring 
the sheaf of the first-fruits of your 
harvest unto the priest. 11And he shall 
wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be 
accepted for you; on the morrow after 
the sabbath the priest shall wave it. 
12And in the day when ye wave the 
sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without 
blemish of the first year for a burnt-
offering unto the LORD. 13And the 
meal-offering thereof shall be two 
tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour 
mingled with oil, an offering made by 
fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour; 
and the drink-offering thereof shall be 
of wine, the fourth part of a hin. 14And 
ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched 
corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame 
day, until ye have brought the offering 
of your God; it is a statute for ever 
throughout your generations in all your 
dwellings. 

15And ye shall count unto you from 
the morrow after the aday of rest, from 
the day that ye brought the sheaf of the 
waving; seven weeks shall there be 
complete; 16even unto the morrow 
after the seventh week shall ye number 
fifty days; and ye shall present a new 
meal-offering unto the LORD. 17Ye 
shall bring out of your dwellings two 
wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an 
ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they 
shall be baked with leaven, for first-
fruits unto the LORD. 18And ye shall 
present with the bread seven lambs 
without blemish of the first year, and 
one young bullock, and two rams; they 
shall be a burnt-offering unto the 
LORD, with their meal-offering, and 
their drink-offerings, even an offering 
made by fire, of a sweet savour unto 
the LORD. 19And ye shall offer one he-
goat for a sin-offering, and two he-
lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of 
peace-offerings. 20And the priest shall 

a Heb. sabbath. 


wave them with the bread of the first-
fruits for a wave-offering before the 
LORD, with the two lambs; they shall 
be holy to the LORD for the priest. 
21And ye shall make proclamation on 
the selfsame day; there shall be a holy 
convocation unto you; ye shall do no 
manner of servile work; it is a statute 
for ever in all your dwellings 
throughout your generations. 

22And when ye reap the harvest of 
your land, thou shalt not wholly reap 
the corner of thy field, neither shalt 
thou gather the gleaning of thy 
harvest; thou shalt leave them for the 
poor, and for the stranger: I am the 
LORD your God. 

23And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 24Speak unto the children of 
Israel, saying: 

In the seventh month, in the first day 
of the month, shall be a solemn rest 
unto you, a memorial proclaimed with 
the blast of horns, a holy convocation. 
25Ye shall do no manner of servile 
work; and ye shall bring an offering 
made by fire unto the LORD. 

26And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 

27Howbeit on the tenth day of this 
seventh month is the day of 
atonement; there shall be a holy 
convocation unto you, and ye shall 
afflict your souls; and ye shall bring an 
offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
28And ye shall do no manner of work 
in that same day; for it is a day of 
atonement, to make atonement for you 
before the LORD your God. 29For 
whatsoever soul it be that shall not be 
afflicted in that same day, he shall be 
cut off from his people. 30And 
whatsoever soul it be that doeth any 
manner of work in that same day, that 
soul will I destroy from among his 
people. 31Ye shall do no manner of 
work; it is a statute for ever throughout 
your generations in all your dwellings. 
32It shall be unto you a sabbath of 
solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your 
souls; in the ninth day of the month at 
even, from even unto even, shall ye 
keep your sabbath. 

33And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 34Speak unto the children of 
Israel, saying: 

On the fifteenth day of this seventh 
month is the feast of tabernacles for 
seven days unto the LORD. 35On the 
first day shall be a holy convocation; 
ye shall do no manner of servile work. 
36Seven days ye shall bring an offering 
made by fire unto the LORD; on the 
eighth day shall be a holy convocation 
unto you; and ye shall bring an 
offering made by fire unto the LORD; it 
is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall 
do no manner of servile work. 

37These are the appointed seasons of 
the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to 
be holy convocations, to bring an 
offering made by fire unto the LORD, a 
burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a 
sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on 
its own day; 38beside the sabbaths of 
the LORD, and beside your gifts, and 
beside all your vows, and beside all 


your freewill-offerings, which ye give 
unto the LORD. 

39Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the 
seventh month, when ye have gathered 
in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep 
the feast of the LORD seven days; on 
the first day shall be a solemn rest, and 
on the eighth day shall be a solemn 
rest. 40And ye shall take you on the 
first day the fruit of goodly trees, 
branches of palm-trees, and boughs of 
thick trees, and willows of the brook, 
and ye shall rejoice before the LORD 
your God seven days. 41And ye shall 
keep it a feast unto the LORD seven 
days in the year; it is a statute for ever 
in your generations; ye shall keep it in 
the seventh month. 42Ye shall dwell in 
booths seven days; all that are home-
born in Israel shall dwell in booths; 
43that your generations may know that 
I made the children of Israel to dwell 
in booths, when I brought them out of 
the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your 
God. 

44And Moses declared unto the 
children of Israel the appointed 
seasons of the LORD. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2’Command 
the children of Israel, that they bring 
unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the 
light, to cause a lamp to burn 
continually. 3Without the veil of the 
testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall 
Aaron order it from evening to 
morning before the LORD continually; 
it shall be a statute for ever throughout 
your generations. 4He shall order the 
lamps upon the pure candlestick before 
the LORD continually. 

5And thou shalt take fine flour, and 
bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth 
parts of an ephah shall be in one cake. 
6And thou shalt set them in two rows, 
six in a row, upon the pure table before 
the LORD. 7And thou shalt put pure 
frankincense with each row, that it 
may be to the bread for a memorial-
part, even an offering made by fire 
unto the LORD. 8Every sabbath day he 
shall set it in order before the LORD 
continually; it is from the children of 
Israel, an everlasting covenant. 9And it 
shall be for Aaron and his sons; and 
they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is 
most holy unto him of the offerings of 
the LORD made by fire, a perpetual 
due.’ 

 

10And the son of an Israelitish 
woman, whose father was an Egyptian, 
went out among the children of Israel; 
and the son of the Israelitish woman 
and a man of Israel strove together in 
the camp. 11And the son of the 
Israelitish woman blasphemed the 
Name, and cursed; and they brought 
him unto Moses. And his mother’s 
name was Shelomith, the daughter of 
Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. 12And they 
put him in ward, that it might be 
declared unto them at the mouth of the 
LORD. 

13And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 14’Bring forth him that hath 
cursed without the camp; and let all 
24 




that heard him lay their hands upon his 
head, and let all the congregation stone 
him. 15And thou shalt speak unto the 
children of Israel, saying: Whosoever 
curseth his God shall bear his sin. 
16And he that blasphemeth the name of 
the LORD, he shall surely be put to 
death; all the congregation shall 
certainly stone him; as well the 
stranger, as the home-born, when he 
blasphemeth the Name, shall be put to 
death. 17And he that smiteth any man 
mortally shall surely be put to death. 
18And he that smiteth a beast mortally 
shall make it good: life for life. 19And 
if a man maim his neighbour; as he 
hath done, so shall it be done to him: 
20breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth 
for tooth; as he hath maimed a man, so 
shall it be rendered unto him. 21And he 
that killeth a beast shall make it good; 
and he that killeth a man shall be put 
to death. 22Ye shall have one manner 
of law, as well for the stranger, as for 
the home-born; for I am the LORD your 
God.’ 23And Moses spoke to the 
children of Israel, and they brought 
forth him that had cursed out of the 
camp, and stoned him with stones. 
And the children of Israel did as the 
LORD commanded Moses. 

 


And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses in mount Sinai, saying: 
2Speak unto the children of Israel, and 
say unto them: 

When ye come into the land which I 
give you, then shall the land keep a 
sabbath unto the LORD. 3Six years thou 
shalt sow thy field, and six years thou 
shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in 
the produce thereof. 4But in the 
seventh year shall be a sabbath of 
solemn rest for the land, a sabbath 
unto the LORD; thou shalt neither sow 
thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. 5That 
which groweth of itself of thy harvest 
thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of 
thy undressed vine thou shalt not 
gather; it shall be a year of solemn rest 
for the land. 6And the sabbath-produce 
of the land shall be for food for you: 
for thee, and for thy servant and for 
thy maid, and for thy hired servant and 
for the settler by thy side that sojourn 
with thee; 7and for thy cattle, and for 
the beasts that are in thy land, shall all 
the increase thereof be for food. 

8And thou shalt number seven 
sabbaths of years unto thee, seven 
times seven years; and there shall be 
unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of 
years, even forty and nine years. 9Then 
shalt thou make proclamation with the 
blast of the horn on the tenth day of 
the seventh month; in the day of 
atonement shall ye make proclamation 
with the horn throughout all your land. 
10And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, 
and proclaim liberty throughout the 
land unto all the inhabitants thereof; it 
shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye 
shall return every man unto his 
possession, and ye shall return every 
man unto his family. 11A jubilee shall 
that fiftieth year be unto you; ye shall 
not sow, neither reap that which 
25 




groweth of itself in it, nor gather the 
grapes in it of the undressed vines. 
12For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy 
unto you; ye shall eat the increase 
thereof out of the field. 13In this year 
of jubilee ye shall return every man 
unto his possession. 14And if thou sell 
aught unto thy neighbour, or buy of 
thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not 
wrong one another. 15According to the 
number of years after the jubilee thou 
shalt buy of thy neighbour, and 
according unto the number of years of 
the crops he shall sell unto thee. 
16According to the multitude of the 
years thou shalt increase the price 
thereof, and according to the fewness 
of the years thou shalt diminish the 
price of it; for the number of crops 
doth he sell unto thee. 17And ye shall 
not wrong one another; but thou shalt 
fear thy God; for I am the LORD your 
God. 18Wherefore ye shall do My 
statutes, and keep Mine ordinances 
and do them; and ye shall dwell in the 
land in safety. 19And the land shall 
yield her fruit, and ye shall eat until ye 
have enough, and dwell therein in 
safety. 20And if ye shall say: ‘What 
shall we eat the seventh year? behold, 
we may not sow, nor gather in our 
increase’; 21then I will command My 
blessing upon you in the sixth year, 
and it shall bring forth produce for the 
three years. 22And ye shall sow the 
eighth year, and eat of the produce, the 
old store; until the ninth year, until her 
produce come in, ye shall eat the old 
store. 23And the land shall not be sold 
in perpetuity; for the land is Mine; for 
ye are strangers and settlers with Me. 
24And in all the land of your 
possession ye shall grant a redemption 
for the land. 

25If thy brother be waxen poor, and 
sell some of his possession, then shall 
his kinsman that is next unto him 
come, and shall redeem that which his 
brother hath sold. 26And if a man have 
no one to redeem it, and he be waxen 
rich and find sufficient means to 
redeem it; 27then let him count the 
years of the sale thereof, and restore 
the overplus unto the man to whom he 
sold it; and he shall return unto his 
possession. 28But if he have not 
sufficient means to get it back for 
himself, then that which he hath sold 
shall remain in the hand of him that 
hath bought it until the year of jubilee; 
and in the jubilee it shall go out, and 
he shall return unto his possession. 

29And if a man sell a dwelling-house 
in a walled city, then he may redeem it 
within a whole year after it is sold; for 
a full year shall he have the right of 
redemption. 30And if it be not 
redeemed within the space of a full 
year, then the house that is in the 
walled city shall be made sure in 
perpetuity to him that bought it, 
throughout his generations; it shall not 
go out in the jubilee. 31But the houses 
of the villages which have no wall 
round about them shall be reckoned 
with the fields of the country; they 
may be redeemed, and they shall go 
out in the jubilee. 32But as for the cities 


of the Levites, the houses of the cities 
of their possession, the Levites shall 
have a perpetual right of redemption. 
33And if a man purchase of the Levites, 
then the house that was sold in the city 
of his possession, shall go out in the 
jubilee; for the houses of the cities of 
the Levites are their possession among 
the children of Israel. 34But the fields 
of the open land about their cities may 
not be sold; for that is their perpetual 
possession. 

35And if thy brother be waxen poor, 
and his means fail with thee; then thou 
shalt uphold him: as a stranger and a 
settler shall he live with thee. 36Take 
thou no interest of him or increase; but 
fear thy God; that thy brother may live 
with thee. 37Thou shalt not give him 
thy money upon interest, nor give him 
thy victuals for increase. 38I am the 
LORD your God, who brought you forth 
out of the land of Egypt, to give you 
the land of Canaan, to be your God. 

39And if thy brother be waxen poor 
with thee, and sell himself unto thee, 
thou shalt not make him to serve as a 
bondservant. 40As a hired servant, and 
as a settler, he shall be with thee; he 
shall serve with thee unto the year of 
jubilee. 41Then shall he go out from 
thee, he and his children with him, and 
shall return unto his own family, and 
unto the possession of his fathers shall 
he return. 42For they are My servants, 
whom I brought forth out of the land 
of Egypt; they shall not be sold as 
bondmen. 43Thou shalt not rule over 
him with rigour; but shalt fear thy 
God. 44And as for thy bondmen, and 
thy bondmaids, whom thou mayest 
have: of the nations that are round 
about you, of them shall ye buy 
bondmen and bondmaids. 45Moreover 
of the children of the strangers that do 
sojourn among you, of them may ye 
buy, and of their families that are with 
you, which they have begotten in your 
land; and they may be your possession. 
46And ye may make them an 
inheritance for your children after you, 
to hold for a possession: of them may 
ye take your bondmen for ever; but 
over your brethren the children of 
Israel ye shall not rule, one over 
another, with rigour. 

47And if a stranger who is a settler 
with thee be waxen rich, and thy 
brother be waxen poor beside him, and 
sell himself unto the stranger who is a 
settler with thee, or to the offshoot of a 
stranger’s family, 48after that he is sold 
he may be redeemed; one of his 
brethren may redeem him; 49or his 
uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem 
him, or any that is nigh of kin unto 
him of his family may redeem him; or 
if he be waxen rich, he may redeem 
himself. 50And he shall reckon with 
him that bought him from the year that 
he sold himself to him unto the year of 
jubilee; and the price of his sale shall 
be according unto the number of years; 
according to the time of a hired servant 
shall he be with him. 51If there be yet 
many years, according unto them he 
shall give back the price of his 
redemption out of the money that he 


was bought for. 52And if there remain 
but few years unto the year of jubilee, 
then he shall reckon with him; 
according unto his years shall he give 
back the price of his redemption. 53As 
a servant hired year by year shall he be 
with him; he shall not rule with rigour 
over him in thy sight. 54And if he be 
not redeemed by any of these means, 
then he shall go out in the year of 
jubilee, he, and his children with him. 
55For unto Me the children of Israel are 
servants; they are My servants whom I 
brought forth out of the land of Egypt: 
I am the LORD your God. 

Ye shall make you no idols, 
neither shall ye rear you up a 
graven image, or a pillar, neither shall 
ye place any figured stone in your 
land, to bow down unto it; for I am the 
LORD your God. 2Ye shall keep My 
sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: 
I am the LORD. 

 


3If ye walk in My statutes, and keep 
My commandments, and do them; 
4then I will give your rains in their 
season, and the land shall yield her 
produce, and the trees of the field shall 
yield their fruit. 5And your threshing 
shall reach unto the vintage, and the 
vintage shall reach unto the sowing 
time; and ye shall eat your bread until 
ye have enough, and dwell in your 
land safely. 6And I will give peace in 
the land, and ye shall lie down, and 
none shall make you afraid; and I will 
cause evil beasts to cease out of the 
land, neither shall the sword go 
through your land. 7And ye shall chase 
your enemies, and they shall fall 
before you by the sword. 8And five of 
you shall chase a hundred, and a 
hundred of you shall chase ten 
thousand; and your enemies shall fall 
before you by the sword. 9And I will 
have respect unto you, and make you 
fruitful, and multiply you; and will 
establish My covenant with you. 10And 
ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye 
shall bring forth the old from before 
the new. 11And I will set My 
tabernacle among you, and My soul 
shall not abhor you. 12And I will walk 
among you, and will be your God, and 
ye shall be My people. 13I am the LORD 
your God, who brought you forth out 
of the land of Egypt, that ye should not 
be their bondmen; and I have broken 
the bars of your yoke, and made you 
go upright. 

 

14But if ye will not hearken unto 
Me, and will not do all these 
commandments; 15and if ye shall reject 
My statutes, and if your soul abhor 
Mine ordinances, so that ye will not do 
all My commandments, but break My 
covenant; 16I also will do this unto 
you: I will appoint terror over you, 
even consumption and fever, that shall 
make the eyes to fail, and the soul to 
languish; and ye shall sow your seed in 
vain, for your enemies shall eat it. 
17And I will set My face against you, 
and ye shall be smitten before your 
enemies; they that hate you shall rule 
26 




over you; and ye shall flee when none 
pursueth you. 18And if ye will not yet 
for these things hearken unto Me, then 
I will chastise you seven times more 
for your sins. 19And I will break the 
pride of your power; and I will make 
your heaven as iron, and your earth as 
brass. 20And your strength shall be 
spent in vain; for your land shall not 
yield her produce, neither shall the 
trees of the land yield their fruit. 21And 
if ye walk contrary unto Me, and will 
not hearken unto Me; I will bring 
seven times more plagues upon you 
according to your sins. 22And I will 
send the beast of the field among you, 
which shall rob you of your children, 
and destroy your cattle, and make you 
few in number; and your ways shall 
become desolate. 23And if in spite of 
these things ye will not be corrected 
unto Me, but will walk contrary unto 
Me; 24then will I also walk contrary 
unto you; and I will smite you, even I, 
seven times for your sins. 25And I will 
bring a sword upon you, that shall 
execute the vengeance of the covenant; 
and ye shall be gathered together 
within your cities; and I will send the 
pestilence among you; and ye shall be 
delivered into the hand of the enemy. 
26When I break your staff of bread, ten 
women shall bake your bread in one 
oven, and they shall deliver your bread 
again by weight; and ye shall eat, and 
not be satisfied. 

27And if ye will not for all this 
hearken unto Me, but walk contrary 
unto Me; 28then I will walk contrary 
unto you in fury; and I also will 
chastise you seven times for your sins. 
29And ye shall eat the flesh of your 
sons, and the flesh of your daughters 
shall ye eat. 30And I will destroy your 
high places, and cut down your sun-
pillars, and cast your carcasses upon 
the carcasses of your idols; and My 
soul shall abhor you. 31And I will 
make your cities a waste, and will 
bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, 
and I will not smell the savour of your 
sweet odours. 32And I will bring the 
land into desolation; and your enemies 
that dwell therein shall be astonished 
at it. 33And you will I scatter among 
the nations, and I will draw out the 
sword after you; and your land shall be 
a desolation, and your cities shall be a 
waste. 34Then shall the land be paid 
her sabbaths, as long as it lieth 
desolate, and ye are in your 
enemies’land; even then shall the land 
rest, and repay her sabbaths. 35As long 
as it lieth desolate it shall have rest; 
even the rest which it had not in your 
sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 36And 
as for them that are left of you, I will 
send a faintness into their heart in the 
lands of their enemies; and the sound 
of a driven leaf shall chase them; and 
they shall flee, as one fleeth from the 
sword; and they shall fall when none 
pursueth. 37And they shall stumble one 
upon another, as it were before the 
sword, when none pursueth; and ye 
shall have no power to stand before 
your enemies. 38And ye shall perish 
among the nations, and the land of 


your enemies shall eat you up. 39And 
they that are left of you shall pine 
away in their iniquity in your 
enemies’lands; and also in the 
iniquities of their fathers shall they 
pine away with them. 40And they shall 
confess their iniquity, and the iniquity 
of their fathers, in their treachery 
which they committed against Me, and 
also that they have walked contrary 
unto Me. 41I also will walk contrary 
unto them, and bring them into the 
land of their enemies; if then 
perchance their uncircumcised heart be 
humbled, and they then be paid the 
punishment of their iniquity; 42then 
will I remember My covenant with 
Jacob, and also My covenant with 
Isaac, and also My covenant with 
Abraham will I remember; and I will 
remember the land. 43For the land shall 
lie forsaken without them, and shall be 
paid her sabbaths, while she lieth 
desolate without them; and they shall 
be paid the punishment of their 
iniquity; because, even because they 
rejected Mine ordinances, and their 
soul abhorred My statutes. 44And yet 
for all that, when they are in the land 
of their enemies, I will not reject them, 
neither will I abhor them, to destroy 
them utterly, and to break My 
covenant with them; for I am the LORD 
their God. 45But I will for their sakes 
remember the covenant of their 
ancestors, whom I brought forth out of 
the land of Egypt in the sight of the 
nations, that I might be their God: I am 
the LORD. 

46These are the statutes and 
ordinances and laws, which the LORD 
made between Him and the children of 
Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of 
Moses. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2Speak unto 
the children of Israel, and say unto 
them: 

When a man shall clearly utter a 
vow of persons unto the LORD, 
according to thy valuation, 3then thy 
valuation shall be for the male from 
twenty years old even unto sixty years 
old, even thy valuation shall be fifty 
shekels of silver, after the shekel of the 
sanctuary. 4And if it be a female, then 
thy valuation shall be thirty shekels. 
5And if it be from five years old even 
unto twenty years old, then thy 
valuation shall be for the male twenty 
shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
6And if it be from a month old even 
unto five years old, then thy valuation 
shall be for the male five shekels of 
silver, and for the female thy valuation 
shall be three shekels of silver. 7And if 
it be from sixty years old and upward: 
if it be a male, then thy valuation shall 
be fifteen shekels, and for the female 
ten shekels. 8But if he be too poor for 
thy valuation, then he shall be set 
before the priest, and the priest shall 
value him; according to the means of 
him that vowed shall the priest value 
him. 

9And if it be a beast, whereof men 
bring an offering unto the LORD, all 
27 




that any man giveth of such unto the 
LORD shall be holy. 10He shall not alter 
it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a 
bad for a good; and if he shall at all 
change beast for beast, then both it and 
that for which it is changed shall be 
holy. 11And if it be any unclean beast, 
of which they may not bring an 
offering unto the LORD, then he shall 
set the beast before the priest. 12And 
the priest shall value it, whether it be 
good or bad; as thou the priest valuest 
it, so shall it be. 13But if he will indeed 
redeem it, then he shall add the fifth 
part thereof unto thy valuation. 

14And when a man shall sanctify his 
house to be holy unto the LORD, then 
the priest shall value it, whether it be 
good or bad; as the priest shall value it, 
so shall it stand. 15And if he that 
sanctified it will redeem his house, 
then he shall add the fifth part of the 
money of thy valuation unto it, and it 
shall be his. 

16And if a man shall sanctify unto 
the LORD part of the field of his 
possession, then thy valuation shall be 
according to the sowing thereof; the 
sowing of a homer of barley shall be 
valued at fifty shekels of silver. 17If he 
sanctify his field from the year of 
jubilee, according to thy valuation it 
shall stand. 18But if he sanctify his 
field after the jubilee, then the priest 
shall reckon unto him the money 
according to the years that remain unto 
the year of jubilee, and an abatement 
shall be made from thy valuation. 
19And if he that sanctified the field will 
indeed redeem it, then he shall add the 
fifth part of the money of thy valuation 
unto it, and it shall be assured to him. 
20And if he will not redeem the field, 
or if he have sold the field to another 
man, it shall not be redeemed any 
more. 21But the field, when it goeth out 
in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the 
LORD, as a field devoted; the 
possession thereof shall be the priest’s. 
22And if he sanctify unto the LORD a 
field which he hath bought, which is 
not of the field of his possession; 
23then the priest shall reckon unto him 
the worth of thy valuation unto the 
year of jubilee; and he shall give thy 
valuation in that day, as a holy thing 
unto the LORD. 24In the year of jubilee 
the field shall return unto him of 
whom it was bought, even to him to 
whom the possession of the land 
belongeth. 25And all thy valuations 
shall be according to the shekel of the 
sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the 
shekel. 

26Howbeit the firstling among 
beasts, which is born as a firstling to 
the LORD, no man shall sanctify it; 
whether it be ox or sheep, it is the 
LORD’S. 27And if it be of an unclean 
beast, then he shall ransom it 
according to thy valuation, and shall 
add unto it the fifth part thereof; or if it 
be not redeemed, then it shall be sold 
according to thy valuation. 

28Notwithstanding, no devoted 
thing, that a man may devote unto the 
LORD of all that he hath, whether of 
man or beast, or of the field of his 


possession, shall be sold or redeemed; 
every devoted thing is most holy unto 
the LORD. 29None devoted, that may be 
devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he 
shall surely be put to death. 

30And all the tithe of the land, 
whether of the seed of the land, or of 
the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’S; it is 
holy unto the LORD. 31And if a man 
will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall 
add unto it the fifth part thereof. 32And 
all the tithe of the herd or the flock, 
whatsoever passeth under the rod, the 
tenth shall be holy unto the LORD. 33He 
shall not inquire whether it be good or 
bad, neither shall he change it; and if 
he change it at all, then both it and that 
for which it is changed shall be holy; it 
shall not be redeemed. 

34These are the commandments, 
which the LORD commanded Moses for 
the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
