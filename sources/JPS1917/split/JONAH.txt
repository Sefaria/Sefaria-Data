JONAH 

 

Now the word of the LORD came 
unto Jonah the son of Amittai, 
saying: 2’Arise, go to Nineveh, that 
great city, and proclaim against it; for 
their wickedness is come up before 
Me.’ 3But Jonah rose up to flee unto 
Tarshish from the presence of the 
LORD; and he went down to Joppa, and 
found a ship going to Tarshish; so he 
paid the fare thereof, and went down 
into it, to go with them unto Tarshish, 
from the presence of the LORD. 

4But the LORD hurled a great wind 
into the sea, and there was a mighty 
tempest in the sea, so that the ship was 
like to be broken. 5And the mariners 
were afraid, and cried every man unto 
his god; and they cast forth the wares 
that were in the ship into the sea, to 
lighten it unto them. But Jonah was 
gone down into the innermost parts of 
1 




the ship; and he lay, and was fast 
asleep. 6So the shipmaster came to 
him, and said unto him: ‘What 
meanest thou that thou sleepest? arise, 
call upon thy God, if so be that God 
will think upon us, that we perish not.’ 

7And they said every one to his 
fellow: ‘Come, and let us cast lots, that 
we may know for whose cause this 
evil is upon us.’ So they cast lots, and 
the lot fell upon Jonah. 8Then said they 
unto him: ‘Tell us, we pray thee, for 
whose cause this evil is upon us: what 
is thine occupation? and whence 
comest thou? what is thy country? and 
of what people art thou?’ 9And he said 
unto them: ‘I am an Hebrew; and I fear 
the LORD, the God of heaven, who hath 
made the sea and the dry land.’ 10Then 
were the men exceedingly afraid, and 
said unto him: ‘What is this that thou 
hast done?’ For the men knew that he 
fled from the presence of the LORD, 
because he had told them. 

11Then said they unto him: ‘What 
shall we do unto thee, that the sea may 
be calm unto us?’ for the sea grew 
more and more tempestuous. 12And he 
said unto them: ‘Take me up, and cast 
me forth into the sea; so shall the sea 
be calm unto you; for I know that for 
my sake this great tempest is upon 
you.’ 13Nevertheless the men rowed 
hard to bring it to the land; but they 
could not; for the sea grew more and 
more tempestuous against them. 
14Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, 
and said: ‘We beseech Thee, O LORD, 
we beseech Thee, let us not perish for 
this man’s life, and lay not upon us 
innocent blood; for Thou, O LORD, hast 
done as it pleased Thee.’ 15So they 
took up Jonah, and cast him forth into 
the sea; and the sea ceased from its 
raging. 16Then the men feared the LORD 
exceedingly; and they offered a 
sacrifice unto the LORD, and made 
vows. 

And the LORD prepared a great 
fish to swallow up Jonah; and 
Jonah was in the belly of the fish three 
days and three nights. 2Then Jonah 
prayed unto the LORD his God out of 
the fish’s belly. 3And he said: 

I called out of mine affliction 

Unto the LORD, and He answered 
me; 

Out of the belly of the nether-world 
cried I, 

And Thou heardest my voice. 

4For Thou didst cast me into the 
depth, 

In the heart of the seas, 

And the flood was round about me; 

All Thy waves and Thy billows 

Passed over me. 

5And I said: ‘I am cast out 

From before Thine eyes’; 

Yet I will look again 

Toward Thy holy temple. 

6The waters compassed me about, 
even to the soul; 

The deep was round about me; 

The weeds were wrapped about my 
head. 

7I went down to the bottoms of the 
mountains; 
2 




The earth with her bars closed upon 
me for ever; 

Yet hast Thou brought up my life 
from the pit, 

O LORD my God. 

8When my soul fainted within me, 

I remembered the LORD; 

And my prayer came in unto Thee, 

Into Thy holy temple. 

9They that regard lying vanities 

Forsake their own mercy. 

10But I will sacrifice unto Thee 

With the voice of thanksgiving; 

That which I have vowed I will pay. 

Salvation is of the LORD. 

11And the LORD spoke unto the fish, 
and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry 
land. 

And the word of the LORD came 
unto Jonah the second time, 
saying: 2’Arise, go unto Nineveh, that 
great city, and make unto it the 
proclamation that I bid thee.’ 3So 
Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, 
according to the word of the LORD. 
Now Nineveh was an exceeding great 
city, of three days’journey. 4And Jonah 
began to enter into the city a day’s 
journey, and he proclaimed, and said: 
‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be 
overthrown.’ 

5And the people of Nineveh 
believed God; and they proclaimed a 
fast, and put on sackcloth, from the 
greatest of them even to the least of 
them. 6And the tidings reached the 
king of Nineveh, and he arose from his 
throne, and laid his robe from him, and 
covered him with sackcloth, and sat in 
ashes. 7And he caused it to be 
proclaimed and published through 
Nineveh by the decree of the king and 
his nobles, saying: ‘Let neither man 
nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any 
thing; let them not feed, nor drink 
water; 8but let them be covered with 
sackcloth, both man and beast, and let 
them cry mightily unto God; yea, let 
them turn every one from his evil way, 
and from the violence that is in their 
hands. 9Who knoweth whether God 
will not turn and repent, and turn away 
from His fierce anger, that we perish 
not?’ 

10And God saw their works, that 
they turned from their evil way; and 
God repented of the evil, which He 
said He would do unto them; and He 

did it not. 1But it displeased Jonah 
exceedingly, and he was angry. 
2And he prayed unto the LORD, and 
said: ‘I pray Thee, O LORD, was not 
this my saying, when I was yet in mine 
own country? Therefore I fled 
beforehand unto Tarshish; for I knew 
that Thou art a gracious God, and 
compassionate, long-suffering, and 
abundant in mercy, and repentest Thee 
of the evil. 3Therefore now, O LORD, 
take, I beseech Thee, my life from me; 
for it is better for me to die than to 
live.’ 4And the LORD said: ‘Art thou 
greatly angry?’ 

5Then Jonah went out of the city, 
and sat on the east side of the city, and 
there made him a booth, and sat under 
it in the shadow, till he might see what 
would become of the city. 6And the 
3 

4 




LORD God prepared a gourd, and made 
it to come up over Jonah, that it might 
be a shadow over his head, to deliver 
him from his evil. So Jonah was 
exceeding glad because of the gourd. 
7But God prepared a worm when the 
morning rose the next day, and it 
smote the gourd, that it withered. 8And 
it came to pass, when the sun arose, 
that God prepared a vehement east 
wind; and the sun beat upon the head 
of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested 
for himself that he might die, and said: 
‘It is better for me to die than to live.’ 
9And God said to Jonah: ‘Art thou 
greatly angry for the gourd?’ And he 
said: ‘I am greatly angry, even unto 
death.’ 10And the LORD said: ‘Thou 
hast had pity on the gourd, for which 
thou hast not laboured, neither madest 
it grow, which came up in a night, and 
perished in a night; 11and should not I 
have pity on Nineveh, that great city, 
wherein are more than sixscore 
thousand persons that cannot discern 
between their right hand and their left 
hand, and also much cattle?’
