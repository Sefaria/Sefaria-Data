AMOS 

 

The words of Amos, who was 
among the herdmen of Tekoa, 
which he saw concerning Israel in the 
days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in 
the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash 
king of Israel, two years before the 
earthquake. 

 

2And he said: 

The LORD roareth from Zion, 

And uttereth His voice from 
Jerusalem; and the pastures of the 
shepherds shall mourn, and the 
top of Carmel shall wither. 

 

3For thus saith the LORD: For three 
transgressions of Damascus, yea, 
for four, I will not reverse it: 
because they have threshed 
Gilead with sledges of iron. 

4So will I send a fire into the house 
of Hazael, and it shall devour the 
palaces of Ben-hadad; 

5And I will break the bar of 
Damascus, and cut off the 
inhabitant from Bikath-Aven, and 
him that holdeth the sceptre from 
Beth-eden; and the people of 
Aram shall go into captivity unto 
Kir, saith the LORD. 

 

6Thus saith the LORD: For three 
transgressions of Gaza, yea, for 
four, I will not reverse it: because 
they carried away captive a whole 
captivity, to deliver them up to 
Edom. 

7So will I send a fire on the wall of 
Gaza, and it shall devour the 
palaces thereof; 

8And I will cut off the inhabitant 
from Ashdod, and him that 
holdeth the sceptre from 
Ashkelon; and I will turn My 
hand against Ekron, and the 
remnant of the Philistines shall 
perish, saith the Lord GOD. 

 

9Thus saith the LORD: For three 
transgressions of Tyre, yea, for 
four, I will not reverse it: because 
they delivered up a whole 
1 




captivity to Edom, and 
remembered not the brotherly 
covenant. 

10So will I send a fire on the wall of 
Tyre, and it shall devour the 
palaces thereof. 

 

11Thus saith the LORD: For three 
transgressions of Edom, yea, for 
four, I will not reverse it: because 
he did pursue his brother with the 
sword, and did cast off all pity, 
and his anger did tear perpetually, 
and he kept his wrath for ever. 

12So will I send a fire upon Teman, 
and it shall devour the palaces of 
Bozrah. 

 

13Thus saith the LORD: For three 
transgressions of the children of 
Ammon, yea, for four, I will not 
reverse it: because they have 
ripped up the women with child 
of Gilead, that they might enlarge 
their border. 

14So will I kindle a fire in the wall of 
Rabbah, and it shall devour the 
palaces thereof, with shouting in 
the day of battle, with a tempest 
in the day of the whirlwind; 

15And their king shall go into 
captivity, he and his princes 
together, saith the LORD. 

 

Thus saith the LORD: 

For three transgressions of Moab, 

Yea, for four, I will not reverse it: 

Because he burned the bones of the 
king of Edom into lime. 

2So will I send a fire upon Moab, 

And it shall devour the palaces of 
Kerioth; 

And Moab shall die with tumult, 

With shouting, and with the sound 
of the horn; 

3And I will cut off the judge from 
the midst thereof, 

And will slay all the princes thereof 
with him, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

4Thus saith the LORD: 

For three transgressions of Judah, 

Yea, for four, I will not reverse it: 

Because they have rejected the law 
of the LORD, 

And have not kept His statutes, 

And their lies have caused them to 
err, 

After which their fathers did walk. 

5So will I send a fire upon Judah, 

And it shall devour the palaces of 
Jerusalem. 

 

6Thus saith the LORD: 

For three transgressions of Israel, 

Yea, for four, I will not reverse it: 

Because they sell the righteous for 
silver, 

And the needy for a pair of shoes; 

7That pant after the dust of the earth 
on the head of the poor, 

And turn aside the way of the 
humble; 

And a man and his father go unto 
the same maid, 

To profane My holy name; 
2 




8And they lay themselves down 
beside every altar 

Upon clothes taken in pledge, 

And in the house of their God they 
drink 

The wine of them that have been 
fined. 

9Yet destroyed I the Amorite before 
them, 

Whose height was like the height of 
the cedars, 

And he was strong as the oaks; 

Yet I destroyed his fruit from above, 

And his roots from beneath. 

10Also I brought you up out of the 
land of Egypt, 

And led you forty years in the 
wilderness, 

To possess the land of the Amorites. 

11And I raised up of your sons for 
prophets, 

And of your young men for 
Nazirites. 

Is it not even thus, O ye children of 
Israel? 

Saith the LORD. 

12But ye gave the Nazirites wine to 
drink; 

And commanded the prophets, 
saying: ‘Prophesy not.’ 

13Behold, I will make it creak under 
you, 

As a cart creaketh that is full of 
sheaves. 

14And flight shall fail the swift, 

And the strong shall not exert his 
strength, 

Neither shall the mighty deliver 
himself; 

15Neither shall he stand that 
handleth the bow; 

And he that is swift of foot shall not 
deliver himself; 

Neither shall he that rideth the horse 
deliver himself; 

16And he that is courageous among 
the mighty 

Shall flee away naked in that day, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

Hear this word that the LORD hath 
spoken against you, O children of 
Israel, against the whole family which 
I brought up out of the land of Egypt, 
saying: 

2You only have I known of all the 
families of the earth; 

Therefore I will visit upon you all 
your iniquities. 

 

3Will two walk together, 

Except they have agreed? 

4Will a lion roar in the forest, 

When he hath no prey? 

Will a young lion give forth his 
voice out of his den, 

If he have taken nothing? 

5Will a bird fall in a snare upon the 
earth, 

Where there is no lure for it? 

Will a snare spring up from the 
ground, 

And have taken nothing at all? 

6Shall the horn be blown in a city, 

And the people not tremble? 

Shall evil befall a city, 

And the LORD hath not done it? 

7For the Lord GOD will do nothing, 
3 




But He revealeth His counsel unto 
His servants the prophets. 

8The lion hath roared, 

Who will not fear? 

The Lord GOD hath spoken, 

Who can but prophesy? 

 

9Proclaim it upon the palaces at 
Ashdod, 

And upon the palaces in the land of 
Egypt, 

And say: ‘Assemble yourselves 
upon the mountains of Samaria, 

And behold the great confusions 
therein, 

And the oppressions in the midst 
thereof.’ 

10For they know not to do right, 
saith the LORD, 

Who store up violence and robbery 
in their palaces. 

11Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 

An adversary, even round about the 
land! 

And he shall bring down thy 
strength from thee, 

And thy palaces shall be spoiled. 

12Thus saith the LORD: 

As the shepherd rescueth out of the 
mouth of the lion 

Two legs, or a piece of an ear, 

So shall the children of Israel that 
dwell in Samaria 

Escape with the corner of a couch, 
and the leg of a bed. 

 

13Hear ye, and testify against the 
house of Jacob, 

Saith the Lord GOD, the God of 
hosts. 

14For in the day that I shall visit the 
transgressions of Israel upon him, 

I will also punish the altars of Beth-
el, 

And the horns of the altar shall be 
cut off, 

And fall to the ground. 

15And I will smite the winter-house 
with the summer-house; 

And the houses of ivory shall perish, 

And the great houses shall have an 
end, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

Hear this word, ye kine of 
Bashan, That are in the mountain 
of Samaria, 

That oppress the poor, that crush the 
needy, 

That say unto their lords: ‘Bring, 
that we may feast.’ 

2The Lord GOD hath sworn by His 
holiness: 

Lo, surely the days shall come upon 
you, 

That ye shall be taken away with 
hooks, 

And your residue with fish-hooks. 

3And ye shall go out at the breaches, 
every one straight before her; 

And ye shall be cast into Harmon, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

4Come to Beth-el, and transgress, 

To Gilgal, and multiply 
transgression; 
4 




And bring your sacrifices in the 
morning, 

And your tithes after three days; 

5And offer a sacrifice of 
thanksgiving of that which is 
leavened, 

And proclaim freewill-offerings and 
publish them; 

For so ye love to do, O ye children 
of Israel, 

Saith the Lord GOD. 

 

6And I also have given you 

Cleanness of teeth in all your cities, 

And want of bread in all your 
places; 

Yet have ye not returned unto Me, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

7And I also have withholden the rain 
from you, 

When there were yet three months 
to the harvest; 

And I caused it to rain upon one 
city, 

And caused it not to rain upon 
another city; 

One piece was rained upon, 

And the piece whereupon it rained 
not withered. 

8So two or three cities wandered 
unto one city 

To drink water, and were not 
satisfied; 

Yet have ye not returned unto Me, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

9I have smitten you with blasting 
and mildew; 

The multitude of your gardens and 
your vineyards 

And your fig-trees and your olive-
trees 

Hath the palmer-worm devoured; 

Yet have ye not returned unto Me, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

10I have sent among you the 
pestilence in the way of Egypt; 

Your young men have I slain with 
the sword, 

And have carried away your horses; 

And I have made the stench of your 
camp to come up even into your 
nostrils; 

Yet have ye not returned unto Me, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

11I have overthrown some of you, 

As God overthrew Sodom and 
Gomorrah, 

And ye were as a brand plucked out 
of the burning; 

Yet have ye not returned unto Me, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

12Therefore thus will I do unto thee, 
O Israel; 

Because I will do this unto thee, 

Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. 

13For, lo, He that formeth the 
mountains, and createth the wind, 

And declareth unto man what is his 
thought, 

That maketh the morning darkness, 

And treadeth upon the high places 
of the earth; 


The LORD, the God of hosts, is His 
name. 

 

Hear ye this word which I take up 
for a lamentation over you, O 
house of Israel: 

2The virgin of Israel is fallen, 

She shall no more rise; 

She is cast down upon her land, 

There is none to raise her up. 

3For thus saith the Lord GOD: The city 
that went forth a thousand shall have a 
hundred left, and that which went forth 
a hundred shall have ten left, of the 
house of Israel. 

 

4For thus saith the LORD unto the 
house of Israel: 

Seek ye Me, and live; 

5But seek not Beth-el, 

Nor enter into Gilgal, 

And pass not to Beer-sheba; 

For Gilgal shall surely go into 
captivity, 

And Beth-el shall come to nought. 

6Seek the LORD, and live— 

Lest He break out like fire in the 
house of Joseph, 

And it devour, and there be none to 
quench it in Bethel— 

7Ye who turn judgment to 
wormwood, 

And cast righteousness to the 
ground; 

8Him that maketh the Pleiades and 
Orion, 

And bringeth on the shadow of 
death in the morning, 

And darkeneth the day into night; 

That calleth for the waters of the 
sea, 

And poureth them out upon the face 
of the earth; 

The LORD is His name; 

9That causeth destruction to flash 
upon the strong, 

So that destruction cometh upon the 
fortress. 

 

10They hate him that reproveth in 
the gate, 

And they abhor him that speaketh 
uprightly. 

11Therefore, because ye trample 
upon the poor, 

And take from him exactions of 
wheat; 

Ye have built houses of hewn stone, 

But ye shall not dwell in them, 

Ye have planted pleasant vineyards, 

But ye shall not drink wine thereof. 

12For I know how manifold are your 
transgressions, 

And how mighty are your sins; 

Ye that afflict the just, that take a 
ransom, 

And that turn aside the needy in the 
gate. 

13Therefore the prudent doth keep 
silence in such a time; 

For it is an evil time. 

 

14Seek good, and not evil, that ye 
may live; 

And so the LORD, the God of hosts, 
will be with you, as ye say. 

15Hate the evil, and love the good, 

And establish justice in the gate; 
5 




It may be that the LORD, the God of 
hosts, 

Will be gracious unto the remnant of 
Joseph. 

 

16Therefore thus saith the LORD, 

The God of hosts, the Lord: 

Lamentation shall be in all the broad 
places, 

And they shall say in all the streets: 
‘Alas! alas! ’ 

And they shall call the husbandman 
to mourning, 

And proclaim lamentation to such as 
are skilful of wailing. 

17And in all vineyards shall be 
lamentation; 

For I will pass through the midst of 
thee, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

18Woe unto you that desire the day 
of the LORD! 

Wherefore would ye have the day of 
the LORD? 

It is darkness, and not light. 

19As if a man did flee from a lion, 

And a bear met him; 

And went into the house and leaned 
his hand on the wall, 

And a serpent bit him. 

20Shall not the day of the LORD be 
darkness, and not light? 

Even very dark, and no brightness in 
it? 

21I hate, I despise your feasts, 

And I will take no delight in your 
solemn assemblies. 

22Yea, though ye offer me burnt-
offerings and your meal-
offerings, 

I will not accept them; 

Neither will I regard the peace-
offerings of your fat beasts. 

23Take thou away from Me the noise 
of thy songs; 

And let Me not hear the melody of 
thy psalteries. 

24But let justice well up as waters, 

And righteousness as a mighty 
stream. 

25Did ye bring unto Me sacrifices and 
offerings in the wilderness forty years, 
O house of Israel? 26So shall ye take 
up Siccuth your king and Chiun your 
images, the star of your god, which ye 
made to yourselves. 27Therefore will I 
cause you to go into captivity beyond 
Damascus, saith He, whose name is 
the LORD God of hosts. 

 

Woe to them that are at ease in 
Zion, 

And to them that are secure in the 
mountain of Samaria, 

The notable men of the first of the 
nations, 

To whom the house of Israel come! 

2Pass ye unto Calneh, and see, 

And from thence go ye to Hamath 
the great; 

Then go down to Gath of the 
Philistines; 

Are they better than these 
kingdoms? 

Or is their border greater than your 
border? 
6 




3Ye that put far away the evil day, 

And cause the seat of violence to 
come near; 

4That lie upon beds of ivory, 

And stretch themselves upon their 
couches, 

And eat the lambs out of the flock, 

And the calves out of the midst of 
the stall; 

5That thrum on the psaltery, 

That devise for themselves 
instruments of music, like David; 

6That drink wine in bowls, 

And anoint themselves with the 
chief ointments; 

But they are not grieved for the hurt 
of Joseph. 

7Therefore now shall they go 
captive at the head of them that 
go captive, 

And the revelry of them that 
stretched themselves shall pass 
away. 

8The Lord GOD hath sworn by 
Himself, 

Saith the LORD, the God of hosts: 

I abhor the pride of Jacob, 

And hate his palaces; 

And I will deliver up the city with 
all that is therein. 

9And it shall come to pass, if there 
remain ten men in one house, that they 
shall die. 10And when a man’s uncle 
shall take him up, even he that burneth 
him, to bring out the bones out of the 
house, and shall say unto him that is in 
the innermost parts of the house: ‘Is 
there yet any with thee?’ and he shall 
say: ‘No’; then shall he say: ‘Hold thy 
peace; for we must not make mention 
of the name of the LORD.’ 

 

11For, behold, the LORD 
commandeth, 

And the great house shall be smitten 
into splinters, 

And the little house into chips. 

12Do horses run upon the rocks? 

Doth one plow there with oxen? 

That ye have turned justice into gall, 

And the fruit of righteousness into 
wormwood; 

13Ye that rejoice in a thing of 
nought, 

That say: ‘Have we not taken to us 
horns by our own strength?’ 

14For, behold, I will raise up against 
you a nation, O house of Israel, saith 
the LORD, the God of hosts; and they 
shall afflict you from the entrance of 
Hamath unto the Brook of the Arabah. 

 

Thus the Lord GOD showed me; 
and, behold, He formed locusts in 
the beginning of the shooting up of the 
latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter 
growth after the king’s mowings. 2And 
if it had come to pass, that when they 
had made an end of eating the grass of 
the land—so I said: 

O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech 
Thee; 

How shall Jacob stand? for he is 
small. 

3The LORD repented concerning this; ‘It 
shall not be’, saith the LORD. 

 
7 




4Thus the Lord GOD showed me; 
and, behold, the Lord GOD called to 
contend by fire; and it devoured the 
great deep, and would have eaten up 
the land. 5Then said I: 

O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech Thee; 

How shall Jacob stand? for he is 
small. 

6The LORD repented concerning this; 
‘This also shall not be’, saith the Lord 
GOD. 

 

7Thus He showed me; and, behold, 
the Lord stood beside a wall made by a 
plumbline, with a plumbline in His 
hand. 8And the LORD said unto me: 
‘Amos, what seest thou?’ And I said: 
‘A plumbline.’ Then said the Lord: 

Behold, I will set a plumbline in the 
midst of My people Israel; 

I will not again pardon them any 
more; 

9And the high places of Isaac shall 
be desolate, 

And the sanctuaries of Israel shall 
be laid waste; 

And I will rise against the house of 
Jeroboam with the sword. 

 

 10Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-
el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, 
saying: ‘Amos hath conspired against 
thee in the midst of the house of Israel; 
the land is not able to bear all his 
words. 11For thus Amos saith: 

Jeroboam shall die by the sword, 

And Israel shall surely be led away 
captive out of his land.’ 

12Also Amaziah said unto Amos: ‘O 
thou seer, go, flee thee away into the 
land of Judah, and there eat bread, and 
prophesy there; 13but prophesy not 
again any more at Beth-el, for it is the 
king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal 
house.’ 14Then answered Amos, and 
said to Amaziah: ‘I was no prophet, 
neither was I a prophet’s son; but I 
was a herdman, and a dresser of 
sycamore-trees; 15and the LORD took 
me from following the flock, and the 
LORD said unto me: Go, prophesy unto 
My people Israel. 16Now therefore hear 
thou the word of the LORD: 

Thou sayest: Prophesy not against 
Israel, 

And preach not against the house of 
Isaac; 

17Therefore thus saith the LORD: 

Thy wife shall be a harlot in the 
city, 

And thy sons and thy daughters 
shall fall by the sword, 

And thy land shall be divided by 
line; 

And thou thyself shalt die in an 
unclean land, 

And Israel shall surely be led away 
captive out of his land.’ 

 

8 



Thus the Lord GOD showed me; 
and behold a basket of summer 
fruit. 2And He said: ‘Amos, what seest 
thou?’ And I said: ‘A basket of 
asummer fruit.’ Then said the LORD 
unto me: 

a Heb. kaiz 


The aend is come upon My people 
Israel; 

a Heb. kez 

I will not again pardon them any 
more. 

3And the songs of the palace shall 
be wailings in that day, 

Saith the Lord GOD; 

The dead bodies shall be many; 

In every place silence shall be cast. 

 

4Hear this, O ye that would swallow 
the needy, 

And destroy the poor of the land, 

5Saying: ‘When will the new moon 
be gone, that we may sell grain? 

And the sabbath, that we may set 
forth corn? 

Making the ephah small, and the 
shekel great, 

And falsifying the balances of 
deceit; 

6That we may buy the poor for 
silver, 

And the needy for a pair of shoes, 

And sell the refuse of the corn?’ 

7The LORD hath sworn by the pride 
of Jacob: 

Surely I will never forget any of 
their works. 

8Shall not the land tremble for this, 

And every one mourn that dwelleth 
therein? 

Yea, it shall rise up wholly like the 
River; 

And it shall be troubled and sink 
again, like the River of Egypt. 

9And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 

Saith the Lord GOD, 

That I will cause the sun to go down 
at noon, 

And I will darken the earth in the 
clear day. 

10And I will turn your feasts into 
mourning, 

And all your songs into lamentation; 

And I will bring up sackcloth upon 
all loins, 

And baldness upon every head; 

And I will make it as the mourning 
for an only son, 

And the end thereof as a bitter day. 

 

11Behold, the days come, saith the 
Lord GOD, 

That I will send a famine in the 
land, 

Not a famine of bread, nor a thirst 
for water, 

But of hearing the words of the 
LORD. 

12And they shall wander from sea to 
sea, 

And from the north even to the east; 

They shall run to and fro to seek the 
word of the LORD, 

And shall not find it. 

13In that day shall the fair virgins 

And the young men faint for thirst. 

14They that swear by the sin of 
Samaria, 

And say: ‘As thy God, O Dan, 
liveth’; 

And: ‘As the way of Beer-sheba 
liveth’; 


Even they shall fall, and never rise 
up again. 

 

I saw the Lord standing beside the 
altar; and He said: 

Smite the capitals, that the posts 
may shake; 

And break them in pieces on the 
head of all of them; 

And I will slay the residue of them 
with the sword; 

There shall not one of them flee 
away, 

And there shall not one of them 
escape. 

2Though they dig into the nether-
world, 

Thence shall My hand take them; 

And though they climb up to 
heaven, 

Thence will I bring them down. 

3And though they hide themselves 
in the top of Carmel, 

I will search and take them out 
thence; 

And though they be hid from My 
sight in the bottom of the sea, 

Thence will I command the serpent, 
and he shall bite them. 

4And though they go into captivity 
before their enemies, 

Thence will I command the sword, 
and it shall slay them; 

And I will set Mine eyes upon them 

For evil, and not for good. 

 

5For the Lord, the GOD of hosts, 

Is He that toucheth the land and it 
melteth, 

And all that dwell therein mourn; 

And it riseth up wholly like the 
River, 

And sinketh again, like the River of 
Egypt; 

6It is He that buildeth His upper 
chambers in the heaven, 

And hath founded His vault upon 
the earth; 

He that calleth for the waters of the 
sea, 

And poureth them out upon the face 
of the earth; 

The LORD is His name. 

7Are ye not as the children of the 
Ethiopians unto Me, 

O children of Israel? saith the LORD. 

Have not I brought up Israel out of 
the land of Egypt, 

And the Philistines from Caphtor, 

And Aram from Kir? 

8Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD 

Are upon the sinful kingdom, 

And I will destroy it from off the 
face of the earth; 

Saving that I will not utterly destroy 
the house of Jacob, 

Saith the LORD. 

9For, lo, I will command, and I will 
sift the house of Israel among all 
the nations, 

Like as corn is sifted in a sieve, 

Yet shall not the least grain fall 
upon the earth. 

10All the sinners of My people shall 
die by the sword, 

That say: ‘The evil shall not 
overtake nor confront us.’ 

 
9 




11In that day will I raise up 

The tabernacle of David that is 
fallen, 

And close up the breaches thereof, 

And I will raise up his ruins, 

And I will build it as in the days of 
old; 

12That they may possess the remnant 
of Edom, 

And all the nations, upon whom My 
name is called, 

Saith the LORD that doeth this. 

 

13Behold, the days come, saith the 
LORD, 

That the plowman shall overtake the 
reaper, 

And the treader of grapes him that 
soweth seed; 

And the mountains shall drop sweet 
wine, 

And all the hills shall melt. 

14And I will turn the captivity of My 
people Israel, 

And they shall build the waste 
cities, and inhabit them; 

And they shall plant vineyards, and 
drink the wine thereof; 

They shall also make gardens, and 
eat the fruit of them. 

15And I will plant them upon their 
land, 

And they shall no more be plucked 
up 

Out of their land which I have given 
them, 

Saith the LORD thy God.
