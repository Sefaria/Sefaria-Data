SECOND KINGS 

 

AND Moab rebelled against Israel 
after the death of Ahab. 

2And Ahaziah fell down through the 
lattice in his upper chamber that was in 
Samaria, and was sick; and he sent 
messengers, and said unto them: ‘Go, 
inquire of Baal-zebub the god of 
Ekron whether I shall recover of this 
sickness.’ 3But an angel of the LORD 
said to Elijah the Tishbite: ‘Arise, go 
up to meet the messengers of the king 
of Samaria, and say unto them: Is it 
because there is no God in Israel, that 
ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god 
of Ekron? 4Now therefore thus saith 
the LORD: Thou shalt not come down 
from the bed whither thou art gone up, 
but shalt surely die.’ And Elijah 
departed. 5And the messengers 
returned unto him, and he said unto 
them: ‘Why is it that ye are returned?’ 
6And they said unto him: ‘There came 
up a man to meet us, and said unto us: 
Go, return unto the king that sent you, 
and say unto him: Thus saith the LORD: 
Is it because there is no God in Israel, 
that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-
zebub the god of Ekron? therefore 
thou shalt not come down from the bed 
whither thou art gone up, but shalt 
surely die.’ 7And he said unto them: 
‘What manner of man was he that 
came up to meet you, and told you 
these words?’ 8And they answered 
him: ‘He was a hairy man, and girt 
with a girdle of leather about his 
loins.’ And he said: ‘It is Elijah the 
Tishbite.’ 

9Then the king sent unto him a 
captain of fifty with his fifty. And he 
went up to him; and, behold, he sat on 
the top of the hill. And he spoke unto 
him: ‘O man of God, the king hath 
said: Come down.’ 10And Elijah 
answered and said to the captain of 
fifty: ‘If I be a man of God, let fire 
come down from heaven, and consume 
thee and thy fifty.’ And there came 
down fire from heaven, and consumed 
him and his fifty. 11And again he sent 
unto him another captain of fifty with 
his fifty. And he answered and said 
unto him: ‘O man of God, thus hath 
the king said: Come down quickly.’ 
12And Elijah answered and said unto 
them: ‘If I be a man of God, let fire 
come down from heaven, and consume 
thee and thy fifty.’ And the fire of God 
came down from heaven, and 
consumed him and his fifty. 13And 
again he sent the captain of a third 
fifty with his fifty. And the third 
captain of fifty went up, and came and 
fell on his knees before Elijah, and 
besought him, and said unto him: ‘O 
man of God, I pray thee, let my life, 
and the life of these fifty thy servants, 
be precious in thy sight. 14Behold, 
1 




there came fire down from heaven, and 
consumed the two former captains of 
fifty with their fifties; but now let my 
life be precious in thy sight’15And the 
angel of the LORD said unto Elijah: ‘Go 
down with him; be not afraid of him.’ 
And he arose, and went down with 
him unto the king. 16And he said unto 
him: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Forasmuch 
as thou hast sent messengers to inquire 
of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it 
because there is no God in Israel to 
inquire of His word? therefore thou 
shalt not come down from the bed 
whether thou art gone up, but shalt 
surely die.’ 

17So he died according to the word 
of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. 
And Jehoram began to reign in his 
stead in the second year of Jehoram 
the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; 
because he had no son. 18Now the rest 
of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, 
are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Israel? 

 

And it came to pass, when the 
LORD would take up Elijah by a 
whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah 
went with Elisha from Gilgal. 2And 
Elijah said unto Elisha: ‘Tarry here, I 
pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me as 
far as Beth-el.’ And Elisha said: ‘As 
the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, 
I will not leave thee.’ So they went 
down to Beth-el.— 3And the sons of 
the prophets that were at Beth-el came 
forth to Elisha, and said unto him: 
‘Knowest thou that the LORD will take 
away thy master from thy head to-
day?’ And he said: ‘Yea, I know it; 
hold ye your peace.’— 4And Elijah 
said unto him: ‘Elisha, tarry here, I 
pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to 
Jericho.’ And he said: ‘As the LORD 
liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not 
leave thee.’ So they came to Jericho.— 
5And the sons of the prophets that 
were at Jericho came near to Elisha, 
and said unto him: ‘Knowest thou that 
the LORD will take away thy master 
from thy head to-day?’ And he 
answered: ‘Yea, I know it; hold ye 
your peace.’— 6And Elijah said unto 
him: ‘Tarry here, I pray thee; for the 
LORD hath sent me to the Jordan.’ And 
he said: ‘As the LORD liveth, and as thy 
soul liveth, I will not leave thee.’ And 
they two went on. 

7And fifty men of the sons of the 
prophets went, and stood over against 
them afar off; and they two stood by 
the Jordan. 8And Elijah took his 
mantle, and wrapped it together, and 
smote the waters, and they were 
divided hither and thither, so that they 
two went over on dry ground. 9And it 
came to pass, when they were gone 
over, that Elijah said unto Elisha: ‘Ask 
what I shall do for thee, before I am 
taken from thee.’ And Elisha said: ‘I 
pray thee, let a double portion of thy 
spirit be upon me.’ 10And he said: 
‘Thou hast asked a hard thing; 
nevertheless, if thou see me when I am 
taken from thee, it shall be so unto 
thee; but if not, it shall not be so.’ 
11And it came to pass, as they still 
2 




went on, and talked, that, behold, there 
appeared a chariot of fire, and horses 
of fire, which parted them both 
assunder; and Elijah went up by a 
whirlwind into heaven. 

12And Elisha saw it, and he cried: 
‘My father, my father, the chariots of 
Israel and the horsemen thereof! ’ And 
he saw him no more; and he took hold 
of his own clothes, and rent them in 
two pieces. 13He took up also the 
mantle of Elijah that fell from him, 
and went back, and stood by the bank 
of the Jordan. 14And he took the 
mantle of Elijah that fell from him, 
and smote the waters, and said: 
‘Where is the LORD, the God of 
Elijah?’ and when he also had smitten 
the waters, they were divided hither 
and thither; and Elisha went over. 

15And when the sons of the prophets 
that were at Jericho some way off saw 
him, they said: ‘The spirit of Elijah 
doth rest on Elisha.’ And they came to 
meet him, and bowed down to the 
ground before him. 16And they said 
unto him: ‘Behold now, there are with 
thy servants fifty strong men; let them 
go, we pray thee, and seek thy master; 
lest peradventure the spirit of the LORD 
hath taken him up, and cast him upon 
some mountain, or into some valley.’ 
And he said: ‘Ye shall not send.’ 
17And when they urged him till he was 
ashamed, he said: ‘Send.’ They sent 
therefore fifty men; and they sought 
three days, but found him not. 18And 
they came back to him, while he 
tarried at Jericho; and he said unto 
them: ‘Did I not say unto you: Go 
not?’ 

19And the men of the city said unto 
Elisha: ‘Behold, we pray thee, the 
situation of this city is pleasant, as my 
lord seeth; but the water is bad, and the 
land miscarrieth. 20And he said: ‘Bring 
me a new cruse, and put salt therein.’ 
And they brought it to him. 21And he 
went forth unto the spring of the 
waters, and cast salt therein, and said: 
‘Thus saith the LORD: I have healed 
these waters; there shall not be from 
thence any more death or 
miscarrying.’ 22So the waters were 
healed unto this day, according to the 
word of Elisha which he spoke. 

23And he went up from thence unto 
Beth-el; and as he was going up by the 
way, there came forth little children 
out of the city, and mocked him, and 
said unto him: ‘Go up, thou baldhead; 
go up, thou baldhead.’ 24And he 
looked behind him and saw them, and 
cursed them in the name of the LORD. 
And there came forth two she-bears 
out of the wood, and tore forty and two 
children of them. 25And he went from 
thence to mount Carmel, and from 
thence he returned to Samaria. 

Now Jehoram the son of Ahab 
began to reign over Israel in 
Samaria in the eighteenth year of 
Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and 
reigned twelve years. 2And he did that 
which was evil in the sight of the 
LORD; but not like his father, and like 
his mother; for he put away the pillar 
of Baal that his father had made. 
3 




3Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins 
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
wherewith he made Israel to sin; he 
departed not therefrom. 

4Now Mesha king of Moab was a 
sheep-master; and he rendered unto the 
king of Israel the wool of a hundred 
thousand lambs, and of a hundred 
thousand rams. 5But it came to pass, 
when Ahab was dead, that the king of 
Moab rebelled against the king of 
Israel. 6And king Jehoram went out of 
Samaria at that time, and mustered all 
Israel. 7And he went and sent to 
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying: 
‘The king of Moab hath rebelled 
against me; wilt thou go with me 
against Moab to battle?’ And he said: 
‘I will go up; I am as thou art, my 
people as thy people, my horses as thy 
horses.’ 8And he said: ‘Which way 
shall we go up?’ And he answered: 
‘The way of the wilderness of Edom.’ 
9So the king of Israel went, and the 
king of Judah, and the king of Edom; 
and they made a circuit of seven 
days’journey; and there was no water 
for the host, nor for the beasts that 
followed them. 10And the king of 
Israel said: ‘Alas! for the LORD hath 
called these three kings together to 
deliver them into the hand of Moab.’ 
11But Jehoshaphat said: ‘Is there not 
here a prophet of the LORD, that we 
may inquire of the LORD by him?’ And 
one of the king of Israel’s servants 
answered and said: ‘Elisha the son of 
Shaphat is here, who poured water on 
the hands of Elijah.’ 12And 
Jehoshaphat said: ‘The word of the 
LORD is with him.’ So the king of 
Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of 
Edom went down to him. 

13And Elisha said unto the king of 
Israel: ‘What have I to do with thee? 
get thee to the prophets of thy father, 
and to the prophets of thy mother.’ 
And the king of Israel said unto him: 
‘Nay; for the LORD hath called these 
three kings together to deliver them 
into the hand of Moab.’ 14And Elisha 
said: ‘As the LORD of hosts liveth, 
before whom I stand, surely, were it 
not that I regard the presence of 
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would 
not look toward thee, nor see thee. 
15But now bring me a minstrel.’ And it 
came to pass, when the minstrel 
played, that the hand of the LORD came 
upon him. 16And he said: ‘Thus saith 
the LORD: Make this valley full of 
trenches. 17For thus saith the LORD: Ye 
shall not see wind, neither shall ye see 
rain, yet that valley shall be filled with 
water; and ye shall drink, both ye and 
your cattle and your beasts. 18And this 
is but a light thing in the sight of the 
LORD; He will also deliver the 
Moabites into your hand. 19And ye 
shall smite every fortified city, and 
every choice city, and shall fell every 
good tree, and stop all fountains of 
water, and mar every good piece of 
land with stones.’ 20And it came to 
pass in the morning, about the time of 
making the offering, that, behold, there 
came water by the way of Edom, and 
the country was filled with water. 


21Now when all the Moabites heard 
that the kings were come up to fight 
against them, they gathered themselves 
together, all that were able to put on 
armour, and upward, and stood on the 
border. 22And they rose up early in the 
morning, and the sun shone upon the 
water, and the Moabites saw the water 
some way off as red as blood; 23and 
they said: ‘This is blood: the kings 
have surely fought together, and they 
have smitten each man his fellow; now 
therefore, Moab, to the spoil.’ 24And 
when they came to the camp of Israel, 
the Israelites rose up and smote the 
Moabites, so that they fled before 
them. And they smote the land, even 
Moab, mightily. 25And they beat down 
the cities; and on every good piece of 
land they cast every man his stone, and 
filled it; and they stopped all the 
fountains of water, and felled all the 
good trees; until there was left only 
Kir-hareseth with the stones of the 
wall thereof; so the slingers 
encompassed it, and smote it. 26And 
when the king of Moab saw that the 
battle was too sore for him, he took 
with him seven hundred men that drew 
sword, to break through unto the king 
of Edom; but they could not. 27Then he 
took his eldest son that should have 
reigned in his stead, and offered him 
for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And 
there came great wrath upon Israel; 
and they departed from him, and 
returned to their own land. 

Now there cried a certain woman 
of the wives of the sons of the 
prophets unto Elisha, saying: ‘Thy 
servant my husband is dead; and thou 
knowest that thy servant did fear the 
LORD; and the creditor is come to take 
unto him my two children to be 
bondmen.’ 2And Elisha said unto her: 
‘What shall I do for thee? tell me; 
what hast thou in the house?’ And she 
said: ‘Thy handmaid hath not any 
thing in the house, save a pot of oil.’ 
3Then he said: ‘Go, borrow thee 
vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, 
even empty vessels; borrow not a few. 
4And thou shalt go in, and shut the 
door upon thee and upon thy sons, and 
pour out into all those vessels; and 
thou shalt set aside that which is full.’ 
5So she went from him, and shut the 
door upon her and upon her sons; they 
brought the vessels to her, and she 
poured out. 6And it came to pass, when 
the vessels were full, that she said unto 
her son: ‘Bring me yet a vessel.’ And 
he said unto her: ‘There is not a vessel 
more.’ And the oil stayed. 7Then she 
came and told the man of God. And he 
said: ‘Go, sell the oil, and pay thy 
debt, and live thou and thy sons of the 
rest.’ 

8And it fell on a day, that Elisha 
passed to Shunem, where was a great 
woman; and she constrained him to eat 
bread. And so it was, that as oft as he 
passed by, he turned in thither to eat 
bread. 9And she said unto her husband: 
‘Behold now, I perceive that this is a 
holy man of God, that passeth by us 
continually. 10Let us make, I pray thee, 
a little chamber on the roof; and let us 4 




set for him there a bed, and a table, 
and a stool, and a candlestick; and it 
shall be, when he cometh to us, that he 
shall turn in thither.’ 11And it fell on a 
day, that he came thither, and he 
turned into the upper chamber and lay 
there. 12And he said to Gehazi his 
servant: ‘Call this Shunammite.’ And 
when he had called her, she stood 
before him. 13And he said unto him: 
‘Say now unto her: Behold, thou hast 
been careful for us with all this care; 
what is to be done for thee? wouldest 
thou be spoken for to the king, or to 
the captain of the host?’ And she 
answered: ‘I dwell among mine own 
people.’ 14And he said: ‘What then is 
to be done for her?’ And Gehazi 
answered: ‘Verily she hath no son, and 
her husband is old.’ 15And he said: 
‘Call her.’ And when he had called 
her, she stood in the door. 16And he 
said: ‘At this season, when the time 
cometh round, thou shalt embrace a 
son.’ And she said: ‘Nay, my lord, 
thou man of God, do not lie unto thy 
handmaid.’ 17And the woman 
conceived, and bore a son at that 
season, when the time came round, as 
Elisha had said unto her. 

18And when the child was grown, it 
fell on a day, that he went out to his 
father to the reapers. 19And he said 
unto his father: ‘My head, my head.’ 
And he said to his servant: ‘Carry him 
to his mother.’ 20And when he had 
taken him, and brought him to his 
mother, he sat on her knees till noon, 
and then died. 21And she went up, and 
laid him on the bed of the man of God, 
and shut the door upon him, and went 
out. 22And she called unto her 
husband, and said: ‘Send me, I pray 
thee, one of the servants, and one of 
the asses, that I may run to the man of 
God, and come back.’ 23And he said: 
Wherefore wilt thou go to him today? 
it is neither new moon nor sabbath.’ 
And she said: ‘It shall be well.’ 24Then 
she saddled an ass, and said to her 
servant: ‘Drive, and go forward; 
slacken me not the riding, except I bid 
thee.’ 25So she went, and came unto 
the man of God to mount Carmel. 

And it came to pass, when the man 
of God saw her afar off, that he said to 
Gehazi his servant: ‘Behold, yonder is 
that Shunammite. 26Run, I pray thee, 
now to meet her, and say unto her: Is it 
well with thee? is it well with thy 
husband? is it well with the child?’ 
And she answered: ‘It is well.’ 27And 
when she came to the man of God to 
the hill, she caught hold of his feet. 
And Gehazi came near to thrust her 
away; but the man of God said: ‘Let 
her alone; for her soul is bitter within 
her; and the LORD hath hid it from me, 
and hath not told Me.’ 28Then she said: 
‘Did I desire a son of my lord? did I 
not say: Do not deceive me?’ 29Then 
he said to Gehazi: ‘Gird up thy loins, 
and take my staff in thy hand, and go 
thy way; if thou meet any man, salute 
him not; and if any salute thee, answer 
him not; and lay my staff upon the 
face of the child.’ 30And the mother of 
the child said: ‘As the LORD liveth, and 


as thy soul liveth, I will not leave 
thee.’ And he arose, and followed her. 
31And Gehazi passed on before them, 
and laid the staff upon the face of the 
child; but there was neither voice, nor 
hearing. Wherefore he returned to 
meet him, and told him, saying: ‘The 
child is not awaked.’ 

32And when Elisha was come into 
the house, behold, the child was dead, 
and laid upon his bed. 33He went in 
therefore, and shut the door upon them 
twain, and prayed unto the LORD. 
34And he went up, and lay upon the 
child, and put his mouth upon his 
mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and 
his hands upon his hands; and he 
stretched himself upon him; and the 
flesh of the child waxed warm. 35Then 
he returned, and walked in the house 
once to and fro; and went up, and 
stretched himself upon him; and the 
child sneezed seven times, and the 
child opened his eyes. 36And he called 
Gehazi, and said: ‘Call this 
Shunammite.’ So he called her. And 
when she was come in unto him, he 
said: ‘Take up thy son.’ 37Then she 
went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed 
down to the ground; and she took up 
her son, and went out. 

38And Elisha came again to Gilgal; 
and there was a dearth in the land; and 
the sons of the prophets were sitting 
before him; and he said unto his 
servant: ‘Set on the great pot, and 
seethe pottage for the sons of the 
prophets.’ 39And one went out into the 
field to gather herbs, and found a wild 
vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds 
his lap full, and came and shred them 
into the pot of pottage; for they knew 
them not. 40So they poured out for the 
men to eat. And it came to pass, as 
they were eating of the pottage, that 
they cried out, and said: ‘O man of 
God, there is death in the pot.’ And 
they could not eat thereof. 41But he 
said: ‘Then bring meal.’ And he cast it 
into the pot; and he said: ‘Pour out for 
the people, that they may eat.’ And 
there was no harm in the pot. 

42And there came a man from Baal-
shalishah, and brought the man of God 
bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves 
of barley, and fresh ears of corn in his 
sack. And he said: ‘Give unto the 
people, that they may eat.’ 43And his 
servant said: ‘How should I set this 
before a hundred men?’ But he said: 
‘Give the people, that they may eat; 
for thus saith the LORD: They shall eat, 
and shall leave thereof.’ 44So he set it 
before them, and they did eat, and left 
thereof, according to the word of the 
LORD. 

Now Naaman, captain of the host 
of the king of Aram, was a great 
man with his master, and held in 
esteem, because by him the LORD had 
given victory unto Aram; he was also a 
mighty man of valour, but he was a 
leper. 2And the Arameans had gone 
out in bands, and had brought away 
captive out of the land of Israel a little 
maid; and she waited on Naaman’s 
wife. 3And she said unto her mistress: 
‘Would that my lord were with the 
5 




prophet that is in Samaria! then would 
he recover him of his leprosy.’ 4And 
he went in, and told his lord, saying: 
‘Thus and thus said the maid that is of 
the land of Israel.’ 5And the king of 
Aram said: ‘Go now, and I will send a 
letter unto the king of Israel.’ And he 
departed, and took with him ten talents 
of silver, and six thousand pieces of 
gold, and ten changes of raiment. 6And 
he brought the letter to the king of 
Israel, saying: ‘And now when this 
letter is come unto thee, behold, I have 
sent Naaman my servant to thee, that 
thou mayest recover him of his 
leprosy.’ 7And it came to pass, when 
the king of Israel had read the letter, 
that he rent his clothes, and said: ‘Am 
I God, to kill and to make alive, that 
this man doth send unto me to recover 
a man of his leprosy? but consider, I 
pray you, and see how he seeketh an 
occasion against me.’ 

8And it was so, when Elisha the man 
of God heard that the king of Israel 
had rent his clothes, that he sent to the 
king, saying: ‘Wherefore hast thou 
rent thy clothes? let him come now to 
me, and he shall know that there is a 
prophet in Israel.’ 9So Naaman came 
with his horses and with his chariots, 
and stood at the door of the house of 
Elisha. 10And Elisha sent a messenger 
unto him, saying: ‘Go and wash in the 
Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall 
come back to thee, and thou shalt be 
clean.’ 11But Naaman was wroth, and 
went away, and said: ‘Behold, I 
thought: He will surely come out to 
me, and stand, and call on the name of 
the LORD his God, and wave his hand 
over the place, and recover the leper. 
12Are not Amanah and Pharpar, the 
rivers of Damascus, better than all the 
waters of Israel? may I not wash in 
them, and be clean?’ So he turned, and 
went away in a rage. 13And his 
servants came near, and spoke unto 
him, and said: ‘My father, if the 
prophet had bid thee do some great 
thing, wouldest thou not have done it? 
how much rather then, when he saith 
to thee: Wash, and be clean?’ 14Then 
went he down, and dipped himself 
seven times in the Jordan, according to 
the saying of the man of God; and his 
flesh came back like unto the flesh of a 
little child, and he was clean. 

15And he returned to the man of 
God, he and all his company, and 
came, and stood before him; and he 
said: ‘Behold now, I know that there is 
no God in all the earth, but in Israel; 
now therefore, I pray thee, take a 
present of thy servant.’ 16But he said: 
‘As the LORD liveth, before whom I 
stand, I will receive none.’ And he 
urged him to take it; but he refused. 
17And Naaman said: ‘If not, yet I pray 
thee let there be given to thy servant 
two mules’burden of earth; for thy 
servant will henceforth offer neither 
burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other 
gods, but unto the LORD. 18In this thing 
the LORD pardon thy servant: when my 
master goeth into the house of 
Rimmon to worship there, and he 
leaneth on my hand, and I prostrate 


myself in the house of Rimmon, when 
I prostrate myself in the house of 
Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant 
in this thing.’ 19And he said unto him: 
‘Go in peace.’ So he departed from 
him some way. 

20But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha 
the man of God, said: ‘Behold, my 
master hath spared this Naaman the 
Aramean, in not receiving at his hands 
that which he brought; as the LORD 
liveth, I will surely run after him, and 
take somewhat of him.’ 21So Gehazi 
followed after Naaman. And when 
Naaman saw one running after him, he 
alighted from the chariot to meet him, 
and said: ‘Is all well?’ 22And he said: 
‘All is well. My master hath sent me, 
saying: Behold, even now there are 
come to me from the hill-country of 
Ephraim two young men of the sons of 
the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a 
talent of silver, and two changes of 
raiment.’ 23And Naaman said: ‘Be 
content, take two talents.’ And he 
urged him, and bound two talents of 
silver in two bags, with two changes of 
raiment, and laid them upon two of his 
servants; and they bore them before 
him. 24And when he came to the hill, 
he took them from their hand, and 
deposited them in the house; and he let 
the men go, and they departed. 25But 
he went in, and stood before his 
master. And Elisha said unto him: 
‘Whence comest thou, Gehazi?’ And 
he said: ‘Thy servant went no 
whither.’ 26And he said unto him: 
‘Went not my heart [with thee], when 
the man turned back from his chariot 
to meet thee? Is it a time to receive 
money, and to receive garments, and 
oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep 
and oxen, and men-servants and maid-
servants? 27The leprosy therefore of 
Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and 
unto thy seed for ever.’ And he went 
out from his presence a leper as white 
as snow. 

And the sons of the prophets said 
unto Elisha: ‘Behold now, the 
place where we dwell before thee is 
too strait for us. 2Let us go, we pray 
thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence 
every man a beam, and let us make us 
a place there, where we may dwell.’ 
And he answered: ‘Go ye.’ 3And one 
said: ‘Be content, I pray thee, and go 
with thy servants.’ And he answered: 
‘I will go.’ 4So he went with them. 
And when they came to the Jordan, 
they cut down wood. 5But as one was 
felling a beam, the axe-head fell into 
the water; and he cried, and said: 
‘Alas, my master! for it was 
borrowed.’ 6And the man of God said: 
‘Where fell it?’ And he showed him 
the place. And he cut down a stick, 
and cast it in thither, and made the iron 
to swim. 7And he said: ‘Take it up to 
thee.’ So he put out his hand, and took 
it. 

8Now the king of Aram warred 
against Israel; and he took counsel 
with his servants, saying: ‘In such and 
such a place shall be my camp.’ 9And 
the man of God sent unto the king of 
Israel, saying: ‘Beware that thou pass 
6 




not such a place; for thither the 
Arameans are coming down.’ 10And 
the king of Israel sent to the place 
which the man of God told him and 
warned him of; and he guarded 
himself there, not once nor twice. 
11And the heart of the king of Aram 
was sore troubled for this thing; and he 
called his servants, and said unto them: 
‘Will ye not tell me which of us is for 
the king of Israel?’ 12And one of his 
servants said: ‘Nay, my lord, O king; 
but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, 
telleth the king of Israel the words that 
thou speakest in thy bed-chamber.’ 
13And he said: ‘Go and see where he 
is, that I may send and fetch him.’ And 
it was told him, saying: ‘Behold, he is 
in Dothan.’ 

14Therefore sent he thither horses, 
and chariots, and a great host; and they 
came by night, and compassed the city 
about. 15And when the servant of the 
man of God was risen early, and gone 
forth, behold, a host with horses and 
chariots was round about the city. And 
his servant said unto him: ‘Alas, my 
master! how shall we do?’ 16And he 
answered: ‘Fear not: for they that are 
with us are more than they that are 
with them.’ 17And Elisha prayed, and 
said: ‘LORD, I pray Thee, open his 
eyes, that he may see.’ And the LORD 
opened the eyes of the young man; and 
he saw; and, behold, the mountain was 
full of horses and chariots of fire round 
about Elisha. 18And when they came 
down to him, Elisha prayed unto the 
LORD, and said: ‘Smite this people, I 
pray Thee, with blindness.’ And He 
smote them with blindness according 
to the word of Elisha. 19And Elisha 
said unto them: ‘This is not the way, 
neither is this the city; follow me, and 
I will bring you to the man whom ye 
seek.’ And he led them to Samaria. 

20And it came to pass, when they 
were come into Samaria, that Elisha 
said: ‘LORD, open the eyes of these 
men, that they may see.’ And the LORD 
opened their eyes, and they saw; and, 
behold, they were in the midst of 
Samaria. 21And the king of Israel said 
unto Elisha, when he saw them: ‘My 
father, shall I smite them? shall I smite 
them?’ 22And he answered: ‘Thou 
shalt not smite them; hast thou taken 
captive with thy sword and with thy 
bow those whom thou wouldest smite? 
set bread and water before them, that 
they may eat and drink, and go to their 
master.’ 23And he prepared great 
provision for them; and when they had 
eaten and drunk, he sent them away, 
and they went to their master. And the 
bands of Aram came no more into the 
land of Israel. 

24And it came to pass after this, that 
Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all 
his host, and went up, and besieged 
Samaria. 25And there was a great 
famine in Samaria; and, behold, they 
besieged it, until an ass’s head was 
sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and 
the fourth part of a kab of dove’s dung 
for five pieces of silver. 26And as the 
king of Israel was passing by upon the 
wall, there cried a woman unto him, 


saying: ‘Help, my lord, O king.’ 27And 
he said: ‘If the LORD do not help thee, 
whence shall I help thee? out of the 
threshingfloor, or out of the 
winepress?’ 28And the king said unto 
her: ‘What aileth thee?’ And she 
answered: ‘This woman said unto me: 
Give thy son, that we may eat him to-
day, and we will eat my son to-
morrow. 29So we boiled my son, and 
did eat him; and I said unto her on the 
next day: Give thy son, that we may 
eat him; and she hath hid her son.’ 
30And it came to pass, when the king 
heard the words of the woman, that he 
rent his clothes—now he was passing 
by upon the wall—and the people 
looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth 
within upon his flesh. 31Then he said: 
‘God do so to me, and more also, if the 
head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall 
stand on him this day.’ 

32But Elisha sat in his house, and the 
elders sat with him; and the king sent a 
man from before him; but ere the 
messenger came to him, he said to the 
elders: ‘See ye how this son of a 
murderer hath sent to take away my 
head? look, when the messenger 
cometh, shut the door, and hold the 
door fast against him; is not the sound 
of his master’s feet behind him?’ 
33And while he yet talked with them, 
behold, the messenger came down 
unto him; and [the king] said: ‘Behold, 
this evil is of the LORD; why should I 
wait for the LORD any longer?’ 

And Elisha said: ‘Hear ye the 
word of the LORD; thus saith the 
LORD: To-morrow about this time shall 
a measure of fine flour be sold for a 
shekel, and two measures of barley for 
a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.’ 
2Then the captain on whose hand the 
king leaned answered the man of God, 
and said: ‘Behold, if the LORD should 
make windows in heaven, might this 
thing be?’ And he said: ‘Behold, thou 
shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt 
not eat thereof.’ 

3Now there were four leprous men 
at the entrance of the gate; and they 
said one to another: ‘Why sit we here 
until we die? 4If we say: We will enter 
into the city, then the famine is in the 
city, and we shall die there; and if we 
sit still here, we die also. Now 
therefore come, and let us fall unto the 
host of the Arameans; if they save us 
alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, 
we shall but die.’ 5And they rose up in 
the twilight, to go unto the camp of the 
Arameans; and when they were come 
to the outermost part of the camp of 
the Arameans, behold, there was no 
man there. 6For the Lord had made the 
host of the Arameans to hear a noise of 
chariots, and a noise of horses, even 
the noise of a great host; and they said 
one to another: ‘Lo, the king of Israel 
hath hired against us the kings of the 
Hittites, and the kings of the 
Egyptians, to come upon us.’ 
7Wherefore they arose and fled in the 
twilight, and left their tents, and their 
horses, and their asses, even the camp 
as it was, and fled for their life. 8And 
when these lepers came to the 7 




outermost part of the camp, they went 
into one tent, and did eat and drink, 
and carried thence silver, and gold, 
and raiment, and went and hid it; and 
they came back, and entered into 
another tent, and carried thence also, 
and went and hid it. 

9Then they said one to another: ‘We 
do not well; this day is a day of good 
tidings, and we hold our peace; if we 
tarry till the morning light, punishment 
will overtake us; now therefore come, 
let us go and tell the king’s 
household.’ 10So they came and called 
unto the porters of the city; and they 
told them, saying.’ We came to the 
camp of the Arameans, and, behold, 
there was no man there, neither voice 
of man, but the horses tied, and the 
asses tied, and the tents as they were.’ 
11And the porters called, and they told 
it to the king’s household within. 
12And the king arose in the night, and 
said unto his servants: ‘I will now tell 
you what the Arameans have done to 
us. They know that we are hungry; 
therefore are they gone out of the 
camp to hide themselves in the field, 
saying: When they come out of the 
city, we shall take them alive, and get 
into the city.’ 13And one of his servants 
answered and said: ‘Let some take, I 
pray thee, five of the horses that 
remain, which are left in the city— 
behold, they are as all the multitude of 
Israel that are left in it; behold, they 
are as all the multitude of Israel that 
are consumed—and let us send and 
see.’ 14They took therefore two 
chariots with horses; and the king sent 
after the host of the Arameans, saying: 
‘Go and see.’ 15And they went after 
them unto the Jordan; and, lo, all the 
way was full of garments and vessels, 
which the Arameans had cast away in 
their haste. And the messengers 
returned, and told the king. 

16And the people went out, and 
spoiled the camp of the Arameans. So 
a measure of fine flour was sold for a 
shekel, and two measures of barley for 
a shekel, according to the word of the 
LORD. 17And the king appointed the 
captain on whose hand he leaned to 
have the charge of the gate; and the 
people trod upon him in the gate, and 
he died as the man of God had said, 
who spoke when the king came down 
to him. 18And it came to pass, as the 
man of God had spoken to the king, 
saying: ‘Two measures of barley for a 
shekel, and a measure of fine flour for 
a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this 
time in the gate of Samaria’; 19and that 
captain answered the man of God, and 
said: ‘Now, behold, if the LORD should 
make windows in heaven, might such 
a thing be?’ and he said: ‘Behold, thou 
shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt 
not eat thereof’; 20it came to pass even 
so unto him; for the people trod upon 
him in the gate, and he died. 

Now Elisha had spoken unto the 
woman, whose son he had 
restored to life, saying: ‘Arise, and go 
thou and thy household, and sojourn 
wheresoever thou canst sojourn; for 
the LORD hath called for a famine; and 
8 




it shall also come upon the land seven 
years.’ 2And the woman arose, and did 
according to the word of the man of 
God; and she went with her household, 
and sojourned in the land of the 
Philistines seven years. 3And it came 
to pass at the seven years’end, that the 
woman returned out of the land of the 
Philistines; and she went forth to cry 
unto the king for her house and for her 
land. 4Now the king was talking with 
Gehazi the servant of the man of God, 
saying: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, all the 
great things that Elisha hath done.’ 
5And it came to pass, as he was telling 
the king how he had restored to life 
him that was dead, that, behold, the 
woman, whose son he had restored to 
life, cried to the king for her house and 
for her land. And Gehazi said: ‘My 
lord, O king, this is the woman, and 
this is her son, whom Elisha restored 
to life.’ 6And when the king asked the 
woman, she told him. So the king 
appointed unto her a certain officer, 
saying: ‘Restore all that was hers, and 
all the fruits of the field since the day 
that she left the land, even until now.’ 

7And Elisha came to Damascus; and 
Ben-hadad the king of Aram was sick; 
and it was told him, saying.’ The man 
of God is come hither.’ 8And the king 
said unto Hazael: ‘Take a present in 
thy hand, and go meet the man of God, 
and inquire of the LORD by him, 
saying: Shall I recover of this 
sickness?’ 9So Hazael went to meet 
him, and took a present with him, even 
of every good thing of Damascus, 
forty camels’burden, and came and 
stood before him, and said: ‘Thy son 
Ben-hadad king of Aram hath sent me 
to thee, saying: Shall I recover of this 
sickness?’ 10And Elisha said unto him: 
‘Go, say unto him: Thou shalt surely 
recover; howbeit the LORD hath shown 
me that he shall surely die.’ 11And he 
settled his countenance stedfastly upon 
him, until he was ashamed; and the 
man of God wept. 12And Hazael said: 
‘Why weepeth my lord?’ And he 
answered: ‘Because I know the evil 
that thou wilt do unto the children of 
Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set 
on fire, and their young men wilt thou 
slay with the sword, and wilt dash in 
pieces their little ones, and rip up their 
women with child.’ 13And Hazael said: 
‘But what is thy servant, who is but a 
dog, that he should do this great 
thing?’ And Elisha answered: ‘The 
LORD hath shown me that thou shalt be 
king over Aram.’ 14Then he departed 
from Elisha, and came to his master, 
who said to him: ‘What said Elisha to 
thee?’ And he answered: ‘He told me 
that thou wouldest surely recover.’ 
15And it came to pass on the morrow, 
that he took the coverlet, and dipped it 
in water, and spread it on his face, so 
that he died; and Hazael reigned in his 
stead. 

16And in the fifth year of Joram the 
son of Ahab king of Israel, 
Jehoshaphat being the king of Judah, 
Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king 
of Judah began to reign. 17Thirty and 
two years old was he when he began to 


reign; and he reigned eight years in 
Jerusalem. 18And he walked in the way 
of the kings of Israel, as did the house 
of Ahab; for he had the daughter of 
Ahab to wife; and he did that which 
was evil in the sight of the LORD. 
19Howbeit the LORD would not destroy 
Judah, for David His servant’s sake, as 
He promised him to give unto him a 
lamp and to his children alway. 

20In his days Edom revolted from 
under the hand of Judah, and made a 
king over themselves. 21Then Joram 
passed over to Zair, and all his chariots 
with him; and he rose up by night, and 
smote the Edomites that compassed 
him about, and the captains of the 
chariots; and the people fled to their 
tents. 22Yet Edom revolted from under 
the hand of Judah, unto this day. Then 
did Libnah revolt at the same time. 
23And the rest of the acts of Joram, and 
all that he did, are they not written in 
the book of the chronicles of the kings 
of Judah? 24And Joram slept with his 
fathers, and was buried with his fathers 
in the city of David; and Ahaziah his 
son reigned in his stead. 

25In the twelfth year of Joram the 
son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah 
the son of Jehoram king of Judah 
begin to reign. 26Two and twenty years 
old was Ahaziah when he began to 
reign; and he reigned one year in 
Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was 
Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of 
Israel. 27And he walked in the way of 
the house of Ahab, and did that which 
was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did 
the house of Ahab; for he was the son-
in-law of the house of Ahab. 28And he 
went with Joram the son of Ahab to 
war against Hazael king of Aram at 
Ramoth-gilead; and the Arameans 
wounded Joram. 29And king Joram 
returned to be healed in Jezreel of the 
wounds which the Arameans had 
given him at Ramah, when he fought 
against Hazael king of Aram. And 
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of 
Judah went down to see Joram the son 
of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was 
sick. 

 

And Elisha the prophet called one 
of the sons of the prophets, and 
said unto him: ‘Gird up thy loins, and 
take this vial of oil in thy hand, and go 
to Ramoth-gilead. 2And when thou 
comest thither, look out there Jehu the 
son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, 
and go in, and make him arise up from 
among his brethren, and carry him to 
an inner chamber. 3Then take the vial 
of oil, and pour it on his head, and say: 
Thus saith the LORD: I have anointed 
thee king over Israel. Then open the 
door, and flee, and tarry not.’ 4So the 
young man, even the young man the 
prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. 5And 
when he came, behold, the captains of 
the host were sitting; and he said: ‘I 
have an errand to thee, O captain.’ 
And Jehu said: ‘Unto which of us all?’ 
And he said: ‘To thee, O captain.’ 
6And he arose, and went into the 
house; and he poured the oil on his 
head, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith 
9 




the LORD, the God of Israel: I have 
anointed thee king over the people of 
the LORD, even over Israel. 7And thou 
shalt smite the house of Ahab thy 
master, that I may avenge the blood of 
My servants the prophets, and the 
blood of all the servants of the LORD, at 
the hand of Jezebel. 8For the whole 
house of Ahab shall perish; and I will 
cut off from Ahab every man-child, 
and him that is shut up and him that is 
left at large in Israel. 9And I will make 
the house of Ahab like the house of 
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like 
the house of Baasa the son of Ahijah. 
10And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the 
portion of Jezreel, and there shall be 
none to bury her.’ And he opened the 
door, and fled. 

11Then Jehu came forth to the 
servants of his lord; and one said unto 
him: ‘Is all well? wherefore came this 
mad fellow to thee?’ And he said unto 
them: ‘Ye know the man and what his 
talk was.’ 12And they said: ‘It is false; 
tell us now.’ And he said: ‘Thus and 
thus spoke he to me, saying: Thus 
saith the LORD: I have anointed thee 
king over Israel.’ 13Then they 
hastened, and took every man his 
garment, and put it under him on the 
top of the stairs, and blew the horn, 
saying: ‘Jehu is king.’ 

14So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the 
son of Nimshi conspired against 
Joram.—Now Joram had been 
guarding Ramoth-gilead, he and all 
Israel, because of Hazael king of 
Aram; 15but king aJoram was returned 
to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds 
which the Arameans had given him, 
when he fought with Hazael king of 
Aram.—And Jehu said: ‘If this be your 
mind, then let none escape and go 
forth out of the city, to go to tell it in 
Jezreel.’ 16So Jehu rode in a chariot, 
and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay 
there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was 
come down to see Joram. 

a Heb. Jehoram, and in verses 17, 21, 
22, 23, 24. 

17Now the watchman stood on the 
tower in Jezreel, and he spied the 
company of Jehu as he came, and said: 
‘I see a company.’ And Joram said: 
‘Take a horseman, and send to meet 
them, and let him say: Is it peace?’ 
18So there went one on horseback to 
meet him, and said: ‘Thus saith the 
king: Is it peace?’ And Jehu said: 
‘What hast thou to do with peace? turn 
thee behind me.’ And the watchman 
told, saying: ‘The messenger came to 
them, but he cometh not back.’ 19Then 
he sent out a second on horseback, 
who came to them, and said: ‘Thus 
saith the king: Is it peace?’ And Jehu 
answered: ‘What hast thou to do with 
peace? turn thee behind me.’ 20And the 
watchman told, saying: ‘He came even 
unto them, and cometh not back; and 
the driving is like the driving of Jehu 
the son of Nimshi; for he driveth 
furiously.’ 

21And Joram said: ‘Make ready.’ 
And they made ready his chariot. And 


Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king 
of Judah went out, each in his chariot, 
and they went out to meet Jehu, and 
found him in the portion of Naboth the 
Jezreelite. 22And it came to pass, when 
Joram saw Jehu, that he said: ‘Is it 
peace, Jehu?’ And he answered: ‘What 
peace, so long as the harlotries of thy 
mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are 
so many?’ 23And Joram turned his 
hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah: 
‘There is treachery, O Ahaziah.’ 24And 
Jehu drew his bow with his full 
strength, and smote Joram between his 
arms, and the arrow went out at his 
heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. 
25Then said [Jehu] to Bidkar his 
captain: ‘Take up, and cast him in the 
portion of the field of Naboth the 
Jezreelite; for remember how that, 
when I and thou rode together after 
Ahab his father, the LORD pronounced 
this burden against him: 26Surely I 
have seen yesterday the blood of 
Naboth, and the blood of his sons, 
saith the LORD; and I will requite thee 
in this plot, saith the LORD. Now 
therefore take and cast him into the 
plot of ground, according to the word 
of the LORD.’ 

27But when Ahaziah the king of 
Judah saw this, he fled by the way of 
the garden-house. And Jehu followed 
after him, and said: ‘Smite him also in 
the chariot’; [and they smote him] at 
the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. 
And he fled to Megiddo, and died 
there. 28And his servants carried him in 
a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him 
in his sepulchre with his fathers in the 
city of David. 

29And in the eleventh year of Joram 
the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to 
reign over Judah. 

30And when Jehu was come to 
Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she 
painted her eyes, and attired her head, 
and looked out at the window. 31And 
as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said: 
‘Is it peace, thou Zimri, thy master’s 
murderer?’ 32And he lifted up his face 
to the window, and said: ‘Who is on 
my side? who?’ And there looked out 
to him two or three officers. 33And he 
said: ‘Throw her down.’ So they threw 
her down; and some of her blood was 
sprinkled on the wall, and on the 
horses; and she was trodden under 
foot. 34And when he was come in, he 
did eat and drink; and he said: ‘Look 
now after this cursed woman, and bury 
her; for she is a king’s daughter.’ 
35And they went to bury her; but they 
found no more of her than the skull, 
and the feet, and the palms of her 
hands. 36Wherefore they came back, 
and told him. And he said: ‘This is the 
word of the LORD, which He spoke by 
His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 
In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs 
eat the flesh of Jezebel; 37and the 
carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung 
upon the face of the field in the portion 
of Jezreel; so that they shall not say: 
This is Jezebel.’ 

Now Ahab had seventy sons in 
Samaria. And Jehu wrote 
letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the 
10 




rulers of Jezreel, even the elders, and 
unto them that brought up [the sons 
of]Ahab, saying: 2’And now as soon as 
this letter cometh to you, seeing your 
master’s sons are with you, and there 
are with you chariots and horses, 
fortified cities also, and armour; 3look 
ye out the best and meetest of your 
master’s sons, and set him on his 
father’s throne, and fight for your 
master’s house.’ 4But they were 
exceedingly afraid, and said: ‘Behold, 
the two kings stood not before him; 
how then shall we stand?’ 5And he that 
was over the household, and he that 
was over the city, the elders also, and 
they that brought up the children, sent 
to Jehu, saying: ‘We are thy servants, 
and will do all that thou shalt bid us; 
we will not make any man king; do 
thou that which is good in thine eyes.’ 
6Then he wrote a letter the second time 
to them, saying: ‘If ye be on my side, 
and if ye will hearken unto my voice, 
take ye the heads of the men your 
master’s sons, and come to me to 
Jezreel by to-morrow this time.’ Now 
the king’s sons, being seventy persons, 
were with the great men of the city, 
who brought them up. 7And it came to 
pass, when the letter came to them, 
that they took the king’s sons, and 
slew them, even seventy persons, and 
put their heads in baskets, and sent 
them unto him to Jezreel. 8And there 
came a messenger, and told him, 
saying: ‘They have brought the heads 
of the king’s sons.’ And he said: ‘Lay 
ye them in two heaps at the entrance of 
the gate until the morning.’ 9And it 
came to pass in the morning, that he 
went out, and stood, and said to all the 
people: ‘Ye are righteous; behold, I 
conspired against my master, and slew 
him; but who smote all these? 10Know 
now that there shall fall unto the earth 
nothing of the word of the LORD, which 
the LORD spoke concerning the house 
of Ahab; for the LORD hath done that 
which He spoke by His servant Elijah.’ 
11So Jehu smote all that remained of 
the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all 
his great men, and his familiar friends, 
and his priests, until there was left him 
none remaining. 

12And he arose and departed, and 
went to Samaria. And as he was at the 
shearing-house of the shepherds in the 
way, 13Jehu met with the brethren of 
Ahaziah king of Judah, and said: ‘Who 
are ye?’ And they answered: ‘We are 
the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go 
down to salute the children of the king 
and the children of the queen.’ 14And 
he said: ‘Take them alive.’ And they 
took them alive, and slew them at the 
pit of the shearing-house, even two 
and forty men; neither left he any of 
them. 

15And when he was departed thence, 
he lighted on Jehonadab the son of 
Rechab coming to meet him; and he 
saluted him, and said to him: ‘Is thy 
heart right, as my heart is with thy 
heart?’ And Jehonadab answered: ‘It 
is.’ ’If it be, [said Jehu,] give me thy 
hand.’ And he gave him his hand; and 
he took him up to him into the chariot. 


16And he said: ‘Come with me, and see 
my zeal for the LORD.’ So they made 
him ride in his chariot. 17And when he 
came to Samaria, he smote all that 
remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he 
had destroyed him, according to the 
word of the LORD, which He spoke to 
Elijah. 

18And Jehu gathered all the people 
together, and said unto them: ‘Ahab 
served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve 
him much. 19Now therefore call unto 
me all the prophets of Baal, all his 
worshippers, and all his priests, let 
none be wanting; for I have a great 
sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever 
shall be wanting, he shall not live.’ But 
Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that 
he might destroy the worshippers of 
Baal. 20And Jehu said: ‘Sanctify a 
solemn assembly for Baal.’ And they 
proclaimed it. 21And Jehu sent through 
all Israel; and all the worshippers of 
Baal came, so that there was not a man 
left that came not. And they came into 
the house of Baal; and the house of 
Baal was filled from one end to 
another. 22And he said unto him that 
was over the vestry: ‘Bring forth 
vestments for all the worshippers of 
Baal.’ And he brought them forth 
vestments. 23And Jehu went, and 
Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the 
house of Baal; and he said unto the 
worshippers of Baal: ‘Search, and look 
that there be here with you none of the 
servants of the LORD, but the 
worshippers of Baal only.’ 24And they 
went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-
offerings. Now Jehu had appointed 
him fourscore men without, and said: 
‘If any of the men whom I bring into 
your hands escape, his life shall be for 
the life of him.’ 

25And it came to pass, as soon as he 
had made an end of offering the burnt-
offering, that Jehu said to the guard 
and to the captains: ‘Go in, and slay 
them; let none come forth.’ And they 
smote them with the edge of the 
sword; and the guard and the captains 
cast them out, and went to the city of 
the house of Baal. 26And they brought 
forth the pillars that were in the house 
of Baal, and burned them. 27And they 
broke down the pillar of Baal, and 
broke down the house of Baal, and 
made it a draught-house, unto this day. 

28Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of 
Israel. 29Howbeit from the sins of 
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith 
he made Israel to sin, Jehu departed 
not from after them, the golden calves 
that were in Beth-el, and that were in 
Dan. 30And the LORD said unto Jehu: 
‘Because thou hast done well in 
executing that which is right in Mine 
eyes, and hast done unto the house of 
Ahab according to all that was in My 
heart, thy sons of the fourth generation 
shall sit on the throne of Israel.’ 31But 
Jehu took no heed to walk in the law 
of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all 
his heart; he departed not from the sins 
of Jeroboam, wherewith he made 
Israel to sin. 

32In those days the LORD began to 
cut Israel short; and Hazael smote 


them in all the borders of Israel: 33from 
the Jordan eastward, all the land of 
Gilead, the Gadites, and the 
Reubenites, and the Manassites, from 
Aroer, which is by the valley of 
Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. 
34Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and 
all that he did, and all his might, are 
they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Israel? 35And 
Jehu slept with his fathers; and they 
buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz 
his son reigned in his stead. 36And the 
time that Jehu reigned over Israel in 
Samaria was twenty and eight years. 

Now when Athaliah the 
mother of Ahaziah saw that 
her son was dead, she arose and 
destroyed all the seed royal. 2But 
Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, 
sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son 
of Ahaziah, and stole him away from 
among the king’s sons that were slain, 
even him and his nurse, and put them 
in the bed-chamber; and they hid him 
from Athaliah, so that he was not slain. 
3And he was with her hid in the house 
of the LORD six years; and Athaliah 
reigned over the land. 

4And in the seventh year Jehoiada 
sent and fetched the captains over 
hundreds, of the Carites and of the 
guard, and brought them to him into 
the house of the LORD; and he made a 
covenant with them, and took an oath 
of them in the house of the LORD, and 
showed them the king’s son. 5And he 
commanded them, saying: ‘This is the 
thing that ye shall do: a third part of 
you, that come in on the sabbath, and 
that keep the watch of the king’s 
house— 6now another third part was at 
the gate Sur, and another third part at 
the gate behind the guard—shall keep 
the watch of the house, and be a 
barrier. 7And the other two parts of 
you, even all that go forth on the 
sabbath, shall keep the watch of the 
house of the LORD about the king. 8And 
ye shall compass the king round about, 
every man with his weapons in his 
hand; and he that cometh within the 
ranks, let him be slain; and be ye with 
the king when he goeth out, and when 
he cometh in.’ 

9And the captains over hundreds did 
according to all that Jehoiada the priest 
commanded; and they took every man 
his men, those that were to come in on 
the sabbath, with those that were to go 
out on the sabbath, and came to 
Jehoiada the priest. 10And the priest 
delivered to the captains over hundreds 
the spear and shields that had been 
king David’s, which were in the house 
of the LORD. 11And the guard stood, 
every man with his weapons in his 
hand, from the right side of the house 
to the left side of the house, along by 
the altar and the house, by the king 
round about. 12Then he brought out the 
king’s son, and put upon him the 
crown and the insignia; and they made 
him king, and anointed him; and they 
clapped their hands, and said: ‘Long 
live the king.’ 

13And when Athaliah heard the 
noise of the guard and of the people, 
11 




she came to the people into the house 
of the LORD. 14And she looked, and, 
behold, the king stood on the platform, 
as the manner was, and the captains 
and the trumpets by the king; and all 
the people of the land rejoiced, and 
blew with trumpets. Then Athaliah 
rent her clothes, and cried: ‘Treason, 
treason.’ 15And Jehoiada the priest 
commanded the captains of hundreds, 
the officers of the host, and said unto 
them: ‘Have her forth between the 
ranks; and him that followeth her slay 
with the sword’; for the priest said: 
‘Let her not be slain in the house of the 
LORD.’ 16So they made way for her; 
and she went by the way of the 
horses’entry to the king’s house; and 
there was she slain. 

17And Jehoiada made a covenant 
between the LORD and the king and the 
people, that they should be the LORD’S 
people; between the king also and the 
people. 18And all the people of the land 
went to the house of Baal, and broke it 
down; his altars and his images broke 
they in pieces thoroughly, and slew 
Mattan the priest of Baal before the 
altars. And the priest appointed 
officers over the house of the LORD. 
19And he took the captains over 
hundreds, and the Carites, and the 
guard, and all the people of the land; 
and they brought down the king from 
the house of the LORD, and came by the 
way of the gate of the guard unto the 
king’s house. And he sat on the throne 
of the kings. 20So all the people of the 
land rejoiced, and the city was quiet; 
and they slew Athaliah with the sword 
at the king’s house. 

Jehoash was seven years old 
when he began to reign. 2In the 
seventh year of Jehu began Jehoash to 
reign; and he reigned forty years in 
Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was 
Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 3And Jehoash 
did that which was right in the eyes of 
the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada 
the priest instructed him. 4Howbeit the 
high places were not taken away; the 
people still sacrificed and offered in 
the high places. 

5And Jehoash said to the priests: 
‘All the money of the hallowed things 
that is brought into the house of the 
LORD, in current money, the money of 
the persons for whom each man is 
rated, all the money that cometh into 
any man’s heart to bring into the house 
of the LORD, 6let the priests take it to 
them, every man from him that 
bestoweth it upon him; and they shall 
repair the breaches of the house, 
wheresoever any breach shall be 
found.’ 7But it was so, that in the three 
and twentieth year of king Jehoash the 
priests had not repaired the breaches of 
the house. 8Then king Jehoash called 
for Jehoiada the priest, and for the 
other priests, and said unto them: 
‘Why repair ye not the breaches of the 
house? now therefore take no longer 
money from them that bestow it upon 
you, but deliver it for the breaches of 
the house.’ 9And the priests consented 
that they should take no longer money 
12 




from the people, neither repair the 
breaches of the house. 

10And Jehoiada the priest took a 
chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, 
and set it beside the altar, on the right 
side as one cometh into the house of 
the LORD; and the priests that kept the 
threshold put therein all the money 
that was brought into the house of the 
LORD. 11And it was so, when they saw 
that there was much money in the 
chest, that the king’s scribe and the 
high priest came up, and they put up in 
bags and counted the money that was 
found in the house of the LORD. 12And 
they gave the money that was weighed 
out into the hands of them that did the 
work, that had the oversight of the 
house of the LORD; and they paid it out 
to the carpenters and the builders, that 
wrought upon the house of the LORD, 
13and to the masons and the hewers of 
stone, and for buying timber and hewn 
stone to repair the breaches of the 
house of the LORD, and for all that was 
laid out for the house to repair it. 14But 
there were not made for the house of 
the LORD cups of silver, snuffers, 
basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, 
or vessels of silver, of the money that 
was brought into the house of the 
LORD; 15for they gave that to them that 
did the work, and repaired therewith 
the house of the LORD. 16Moreover they 
reckoned not with the men, into whose 
hand they delivered the money to give 
to them that did the work; for they 
dealt faithfully. 17The forfeit money, 
and the sin money, was not brought 
into the house of the LORD; it was the 
priests. 

18Then Hazael king of Aram went 
up, and fought against Gath, and took 
it; and Hazael set his face to go up to 
Jerusalem. 19And Jehoash king Judah 
took all the hallowed things that 
Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and 
Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, 
had dedicated, and his own hallowed 
things, and all the gold that was found 
in the treasures of the house of the 
LORD, and of the king’s house, and sent 
it to Hazael king of Aram; and he went 
away from Jerusalem. 

20Now the rest of the acts of Joash, 
and all that he did, are they not written 
in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of Judah? 21And his servants 
arose, and made a conspiracy, and 
smote Joash at Beth-millo, on the way 
that goeth down to Silla. 22 For Jozacar 
the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad 
the son of Shomer, his servants, smote 
him, and he died; and they buried him 
with his fathers in the city of David; 
and Amaziah his son reigned in his 
stead. 

In the three and twentieth year 
of Joash the son of Ahaziah, 
king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of 
Jehu began to reign over Israel in 
Samaria, and reigned seventeen years. 
2And he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the LORD, and followed the 
sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
wherewith he made Israel to sin; he 
departed not therefrom. 3And the anger 
of the LORD was kindled against Israel, 
13 




and He delivered them into the hand of 
Hazael king of Aram, and into the 
hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, 
continually. 4And Jehoahaz besought 
the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto 
him; for He saw the oppression of 
Israel, how that the king of Aram 
oppressed them.— 5And the LORD gave 
Israel a deliverer, so that they went out 
from under the hand of the Arameans; 
and the children of Israel dwelt in their 
tents, as beforetime. 6Nevertheless 
they departed not from the sins of the 
house of Jeroboam, wherewith he 
made Israel to sin, but walked therein; 
and there remained the Asherah also in 
Samaria.— 7For there was not left to 
Jehoahaz of the people save fifty 
horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten 
thousand footmen; for the king of 
Aram destroyed them, and made them 
like the dust in threshing. 8Now the 
rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all 
that he did, and his might, are they not 
written in the book of the chronicles of 
the kings of Israel? 9And Jehoahaz 
slept with his fathers; and they buried 
him in Samaria; and Joash his son 
reigned in his stead. 

10In the thirty and seventh year of 
Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the 
son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in 
Samaria, and reigned sixteen years. 
11And he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the LORD; he departed not from 
all the sins of Jeroboam the son of 
Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to 
sin; but he walked therein. 12Now the 
rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he 
did, and his might wherewith he 
fought against Amaziah king of Judah, 
are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Israel? 13And 
Joash slept with his fathers; and 
Jeroboam sat upon his throne; and 
Joash was buried in Samaria with the 
kings of Israel. 

14Now Elisha was fallen sick of his 
sickness whereof he was to die; and 
Joash the king of Israel came down 
unto him, and wept over him, and said: 
‘My father, my father, the chariots of 
Israel and the horsemen thereof! ’ 
15And Elisha said unto him: ‘Take bow 
and arrows’; and he took unto him 
bow and arrows. 16And he said to the 
king of Israel: ‘Put thy hand upon the 
bow’; and he put his hand upon it. And 
Elisha laid his hands upon the king’s 
hands. 17And he said: ‘Open the 
window eastward’; and he opened it. 
Then Elisha said: ‘Shoot’; and he shot. 
And he said: ‘The LORD’S arrow of 
victory, even the arrow of victory 
against Aram; for thou shalt smite the 
Arameans in Aphek, till thou have 
consumed them.’ 18And he said: ‘Take 
the arrows’; and he took them. And he 
said unto the king of Israel: ‘Smite 
upon the ground’; and he smote thrice, 
and stayed. 19And the man of God was 
wroth with him, and said: ‘Thou 
shouldest have smitten five or six 
times; then hadst thou smitten Aram 
till thou hadst consumed it; whereas 
now thou shalt smite Aram but thrice.’ 

20And Elisha died, and they buried 
him. Now the bands of the Moabites 


used to invade the land at the coming 
in of the year. 21And it came to pass, as 
they were burying a man, that, behold, 
they spied a band; and they cast the 
man into the sepulchre of Elisha; and 
as soon as the man touched the bones 
of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on 
his feet. 

22And Hazael king of Aram 
oppressed Israel all the days of 
Jehoahaz. 23But the LORD was gracious 
unto them, and had compassion on 
them, and had respect unto them, 
because of His covenant with 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would 
not destroy them, neither hath He cast 
them from His presence until now. 
24And Hazael king of Aram died; and 
Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead. 
25And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz 
took again out of the hand of Ben-
hadad the son of Hazael the cities 
which he had taken out of the hand of 
Jehoahaz his father by war. Three 
times did Joash smite him, and 
recovered the cities of Israel. 

In the second year of Joash 
son of Joahaz king of Israel 
began Amaziah the son of Joash king 
of Judah to reign. 2He was twenty and 
five years old when he began to reign; 
and he reigned twenty and nine years 
in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name 
was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 3And he 
did that which was right in the eyes of 
the LORD, yet not like David his father; 
he did according to all that Joash his 
father had done. 4Howbeit the high 
places were not taken away; the people 
still sacrificed and offered in the high 
places. 5And it came to pass, as soon 
as the kingdom was established in his 
hand, that he slew his servants who 
had slain the king his father; 6but the 
children of the murderers he put not to 
death; according to that which is 
written in the book of the law of 
Moses, as the LORD commanded 
saying: ‘The fathers shall not be put to 
death for the children, nor the children 
be put to death for the fathers; but 
every man shall be put to death for his 
own sin.’ 7He slew of Edom in the 
Valley of Salt ten thousand, and took 
Sela by war, and called the name of it 
Joktheel, unto this day. 

8Then Amaziah sent messengers to 
Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of 
Jehu, king of Israel, saying: ‘Come, let 
us look one another in the face.’ 9And 
Jehoash the king of Israel sent to 
Amaziah king of Judah, saying: ‘The 
thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the 
cedar that was in Lebanon, saying: 
Give thy daughter to my son to wife; 
and there passed by the wild beasts 
that were in Lebanon, and trod down 
the thistle. 10Thou hast indeed smitten 
Edom, and will thy heart lift thee up? 
glory therein, and remain at home; for 
why shouldest thou meddle with evil, 
that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and 
Judah with thee? 11But Amaziah would 
not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel 
went up; and he and Amaziah king of 
Judah looked one another in the face at 
Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to 
Judah. 12And Judah was put to the 
14 




worse before Israel; and they fled 
every man to his tent. 13And Jehoash 
king of Israel took Amaziah king of 
Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of 
Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came 
to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall 
of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim 
unto the corner gate, four hundred 
cubits. 14And he took all the gold and 
silver, and all the vessels that were 
found in the house of the LORD, and in 
the treasures of the king’s house, the 
hostages also, and returned to Samaria. 

15Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash 
which he did, and his might, and how 
he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, 
are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Israel? 16And 
Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was 
buried in Samaria with the kings of 
Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in 
his stead. 

17And Amaziah the son of Joash 
king of Judah lived after the death of 
Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel 
fifteen years. 18Now the rest of the acts 
of Amaziah, are they not written in the 
book of the chronicles of the kings of 
Judah? 19And they made a conspiracy 
against him in Jerusalem; and he fled 
to Lachish; but they sent after him to 
Lachish, and slew him there. 20And 
they brought him upon horses; and he 
was buried at Jerusalem with his 
fathers in the city of David. 21And all 
the people of Judah took Azariah, who 
was sixteen years old, and made him 
king in the room of his father 
Amaziah. 22He built Elath, and 
restored it to Judah, after that the king 
slept with his fathers. 

23In the fifteenth year of Amaziah 
the son of Joash king of Judah 
Jeroboam the son of Joash king of 
Israel began to reign in Samaria, and 
reigned forty and one years. 24And he 
did that which was evil in the sight of 
the LORD; he departed not from all the 
sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
wherewith he made Israel to sin. 25He 
restored the border of Israel from the 
entrance of Hamath unto the sea of the 
Arabah, according to the word of the 
LORD, the God of Israel, which He 
spoke by the hand of His servant Jonah 
the son of Amittai, the prophet, who 
was of Gath-hepher. 26For the LORD 
saw the affliction of Israel, that it was 
very bitter; for there was none shut up 
nor left at large, neither was there any 
helper for Israel. 27And the LORD said 
not that He would blot out the name of 
Israel from under heaven; but He 
saved them by the hand of Jeroboam 
the son of Joash. 

28Now the rest of the acts of 
Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his 
might, how he warred, and how he 
recovered Damascus, and Hamath, for 
Judah in Israel, are they not written in 
the book of the chronicles of the kings 
of Israel? 29And Jeroboam slept with 
his fathers, even with the kings of 
Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned 
in his stead. 

In the twenty and seventh year 
of Jeroboam king of Israel 15 




began aAzariah son of Amaziah king 
of Judah to reign. 2Sixteen years old 
was he when he began to reign; and he 
reigned two and fifty years in 
Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was 
Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 3And he did that 
which was right in the eyes of the 
LORD, according to all that his father 
Amaziah had done. 4Howbeit the high 
places were not taken away; the people 
still sacrificed and offered in the high 
places. 5And the LORD smote the king, 
so that he was a leper unto the day of 
his death, and dwelt in a house set 
apart. And Jotham the king’s son was 
over the household, judging the people 
of the land. 6Now the rest of the acts of 
Azariah, and all that he did, are they 
not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Judah? 7And 
Azariah slept with his fathers; and they 
buried him with his fathers in the city 
of David; and Jotham his son reigned 
in his stead. 

a In verses 13, 30, &c., Uzziah. 

8In the thirty and eighth year of 
Azariah king of Judah did Zechariah 
the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel 
in Samaria six months. 9And he did 
that which was evil in the sight of the 
LORD, as his fathers had done; he 
departed not from the sins of Jeroboam 
the son of Nebat, wherewith he made 
Israel to sin. 10And Shallum the son of 
Jabesh conspired against him, and 
smote him before the people, and slew 
him, and reigned in his stead. 11Now 
the rest of the acts of Zechariah, 

behold, they are written in the book of 
the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
12This was the word of the LORD which 
He spoke unto Jehu, saying: ‘Thy sons 
to the fourth generation shall sit upon 
the throne of Israel.’ And so it came to 
pass. 

13Shallum the son of Jabesh began 
to reign in the nine and thirtieth year 
of Uzziah king of Judah; and he 
reigned the space of a month in 
Samaria. 14And Menahem the son of 
Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came 
to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son 
of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, 
and reigned in his stead. 15Now the rest 
of the acts of Shallum, and his 
conspiracy which he made, behold, 
they are written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
16Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and 
all that were therein, and the borders 
thereof, from Tirzah; because they 
opened not to him, therefore he smote 
it; and all the women therein that were 
with child he ripped up. 

17In the nine and thirtieth year of 
Azariah king of Judah began 
Menahem the son of Gadi to reign 
over Israel, and reigned ten years in 
Samaria. 18And he did that which was 
evil in the sight of the LORD; he 
departed not all his days from the sins 
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
wherewith he made Israel to sin. 
19There came against the land Pul the 
king of Assyria; and Menahem gave 
Pul a thousand talents of silver, that 
his hand might be with him to confirm 


the kingdom in his hand. 20And 
Menahem exacted the money of Israel, 
even of all the mighty men of wealth, 
of each man fifty shekels of silver, to 
give to the king of Assyria. So the king 
of Assyria turned back, and stayed not 
there in the land. 21Now the rest of the 
acts of Menahem, and all that he did, 
are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Israel? 22And 
Menahem slept with his fathers; and 
Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead. 

23In the fiftieth year of Azariah king 
of Judah Pekahiah the son of 
Menahem began to reign over Israel in 
Samaria, and reigned two years. 24And 
he did that which was evil in the sight 
of the LORD; he departed not from the 
sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
wherewith he made Israel to sin. 25And 
Pekah the son of Remaliah, his 
captain, conspired against him, and 
smote him in Samaria, in the castle of 
the king’s house, by Argob and by 
Arieh; and with him were fifty men of 
the Gileadites; and he slew him, and 
reigned in his stead. 26Now the rest of 
the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he 
did, behold, they are written in the 
book of the chronicles of the kings of 
Israel. 27In the two and fiftieth year of 
Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son 
of Remaliah began to reign over Israel 
in Samaria, and reigned twenty years. 
28And he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the LORD; he departed not from 
the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
wherewith he made Israel to sin. 29In 
the days of Pekah king of Israel came 
Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and 
took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maacah, and 
Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and 
Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of 
Naphtali; and he carried them captive 
to Assyria. 30And Hoshea the son of 
Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah 
the son of Remaliah, and smote him, 
and slew him, and reigned in his stead, 
in the twentieth year of Jotham the son 
of Uzziah. 31Now the rest of the acts of 
Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they 
are written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Israel. 

32In the second year of Pekah the 
son of Remaliah king of Israel began 
Jotham the son of Uzziah king of 
Judah to reign. 33Five and twenty years 
old was he when he began to reign; 
and he reigned sixteen years in 
Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was 
Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. 34And 
he did that which was right in the eyes 
of the LORD; he did according to all 
that his father Uzziah had done. 
35Howbeit the high places were not 
taken away; the people still sacrificed 
and offered in the high places. He built 
the upper gate of the house of the 
LORD. 36Now the rest of the acts of 
Jotham, and all that he did, are they 
not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Judah? 37In 
those days the LORD began to send 
against Judah Rezin the king of Aram, 
and Pekah the son of Remaliah. 38And 
Jotham slept with his fathers, and was 
buried with his fathers in the city of 


David his father; and Ahaz his son 
reigned in his stead. 

In the seventeenth year of 
Pekah the son of Remaliah 
Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah 
began to reign. 2Twenty years old was 
Ahaz when he began to reign; and he 
reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and 
he did not that which was right in the 
eyes of the LORD his God, like David 
his father. 3But he walked in the way 
of the kings of Israel, yea, and made 
his son to pass through the fire, 
according to the abominations of the 
heathen, whom the LORD cast out from 
before the children of Israel. 4And he 
sacrificed and offered in the high 
places, and on the hills, and under 
every leafy tree. 

5Then Rezin king of Aram and 
Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel 
came up to Jerusalem to war; and they 
besieged Ahaz, but could not 
overcome him. 6At that time Rezin 
king of Aram recovered Elath to 
Aram, and drove the Jews from aElath; 
and the Edomites came to Elath, and 
dwelt there, unto this day. 

a Heb. Eloth. 

7So Ahaz sent messengers to 
Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying: 
‘I am thy servant and thy son; come 
up, and save me out of the hand of the 
king of Aram, and out of the hand of 
the king of Israel, who rise up against 
me.’ 8And Ahaz took the silver and 
gold that was found in the house of the 
LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s 

house, and sent it for a present to the 
king of Assyria. 9And the king of 
Assyria hearkened unto him; and the 
king of Assyria went up against 
Damascus, and took it, and carried the 
people of it captive to Kir, and slew 
Rezin. 

10And king Ahaz went to Damascus 
to meet Tiglath-pileser king of 
Assyria, and saw the altar that was at 
Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to 
Urijah the priest the fashion of the 
altar, and the pattern of it, according to 
all the workmanship thereof. 11And 
Urijah the priest built an altar; 
according to all that king Ahaz had 
sent from Damascus, so did Urijah the 
priest make it against the coming of 
king Ahaz from Damascus. 12And 
when the king was come from 
Damascus, the king saw the altar; and 
the king drew near unto the altar, and 
offered thereon. 13And he offered his 
burnt-offering and his meal-offering, 
and poured his drink-offering, and 
dashed the blood of his peace-
offerings against the altar. 14And the 
brazen altar, which was before the 
LORD, he brought from the forefront of 
the house, from between his altar and 
the house of the LORD, and put it on the 
north side of his altar. 15And king 
Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, 
saying: ‘Upon the great altar offer the 
morning burnt-offering, and the 
evening meal-offering, and the king’s 
burnt-offering, and his meal-offering, 
with the burnt-offering of all the 
people of the land, and their meal-
16 




offering, and their drink-offerings; and 
dash against it all the blood of the 
burnt-offering, and all the blood of the 
sacrifice; but the brazen altar shall be 
for me to look to.’ 16Thus did Urijah 
the priest, according to all that king 
Ahaz commanded. 

17And king Ahaz cut off the borders 
of the bases, and removed the laver 
from off them; and took down the sea 
from off the brazen oxen that were 
under it, and put it upon a pavement of 
stone. 18And the covered place for the 
sabbath that they had built in the 
house, and the king’s entry without, 
turned he unto the house of the LORD, 
because of the king of Assyria. 19Now 
the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he 
did, are they not written in the book of 
the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
20And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and 
was buried with his fathers in the city 
of David; and Hezekiah his son 
reigned in his stead. 

In the twelfth year of Ahaz 
king of Judah began Hoshea 
the son of Elah to reign in Samaria 
over Israel, and reigned nine years. 
2And he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the LORD, yet not as the kings 
of Israel that were before him. 
3Against him came up Shalmaneser 
king of Assyria; and Hoshea became 
his servant, and brought him presents. 
4And the king of Assyria found 
conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent 
messengers to So king of Egypt, and 
offered no present to the king of 
Assyria, as he had done year by year; 
therefore the king of Assyria shut him 
up, and bound him in prison. 5Then the 
king of Assyria came up throughout all 
the land, and went up to Samaria, and 
besieged it three years. 6In the ninth 
year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria 
took Samaria, and carried Israel away 
unto Assyria, and placed them in 
Halah, and in Habor, on the river of 
Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. 

7And it was so, because the children 
of Israel had sinned against the LORD 
their God, who brought them up out of 
the land of Egypt from under the hand 
of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had 
feared other gods, 8and walked in the 
statutes of the nations, whom the LORD 
cast out from before the children of 
Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which 
they practised; 9and the children of 
Israel did impute things that were not 
right unto the LORD their God, and they 
built them high places in all their 
cities, from the tower of the watchmen 
to the fortified city; 10and they set 
them up pillars and Asherim upon 
every high hill, and under every leafy 
tree; 11and there they offered in all the 
high places, as did the nations whom 
the LORD carried away before them; 
and wrought wicked things to provoke 
the LORD; 12and they served idols, 
whereof the LORD had said unto them: 
‘Ye shall not do this thing’; 13yet the 
LORD forewarned Israel, and Judah, by 
the hand of every prophet, and of 
every seer, saying: ‘Turn ye from your 
evil ways, and keep My 
commandments and My statutes, 
17 




according to all the law which I 
commanded your fathers, and which I 
sent to you by the hand of My servants 
the prophets’; 14notwithstanding they 
would not hear, but hardened their 
neck, like to the neck of their fathers, 
who believed not in the LORD their 
God; 15and they rejected His statutes, 
and His covenant that He made with 
their fathers, and His testimonies 
wherewith He testified against them; 
and they went after things of nought, 
and became nought, and after the 
nations that were round about them, 
concerning whom the LORD had 
charged them that they should not do 
like them; 16and they forsook all the 
commandments of the LORD their God, 
and made them molten images, even 
two calves, and made an Asherah, and 
worshipped all the host of heaven, and 
served Baal; 17and they caused their 
sons and their daughters to pass 
through the fire, and used divination 
and enchantments, and gave 
themselves over to do that which was 
evil in the sight of the LORD, to 
provoke Him; 18that the LORD was very 
angry with Israel, and removed them 
out of His sight; there was none left 
but the tribe of Judah only. 19Also 
Judah kept not the commandments of 
the LORD their God, but walked in the 
statutes of Israel which they practised. 
20And the LORD rejected all the seed of 
Israel, and afflicted them, and 
delivered them into the hand of 
spoilers, until He had cast them out of 
His sight. 21For He rent Israel from the 
house of David; and they made 
Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and 
Jeroboam drew Israel away from 
following the LORD, and made them sin 
a great sin. 22And the children of Israel 
walked in all the sins of Jeroboam 
which he did; they departed not from 
them; 23until the LORD removed Israel 
out of His sight, as He spoke by the 
hand of all His servants the prophets. 
So Israel was carried away out of their 
own land to Assyria, unto this day. 

24And the king of Assyria brought 
men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, 
and from Avva, and from Hamath and 
Sepharvaim, and placed them in the 
cities of Samaria instead of the 
children of Israel; and they possessed 
Samaria, and dwelt in the cities 
thereof. 25And so it was, at the 
beginning of their dwelling there, that 
they feared not the LORD; therefore the 
LORD sent lions among them, which 
killed some of them. 26Wherefore they 
spoke to the king of Assyria, saying: 
‘The nations which thou hast carried 
away, and placed in the cities of 
Samaria, know not the manner of the 
God of the land; therefore He hath sent 
lions among them, and, behold, they 
slay them, because they know not the 
manner of the God of the land.’ 

27Then the king of Assyria 
commanded, saying: ‘Carry thither one 
of the priests whom ye brought from 
thence; and let them go and dwell 
there, and let him teach them the 
manner of the God of the land.’ 28So 
one of the priests whom they had 


carried away from Samaria came and 
dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how 
they should fear the LORD. 29Howbeit 
every nation made gods of their own, 
and put them in the houses of the high 
places which the Samaritans had 
made, every nation in their cities 
wherein they dwelt. 30And the men of 
Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and 
the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the 
men of Hamath made Ashima, 31and 
the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, 
and the Sepharvites burnt their 
children in the fire to Adrammelech 
and Anammelech, the gods of 
Sepharvaim. 32So they feared the LORD, 
and made unto them from among 
themselves priests of the high places, 
who sacrificed for them in the houses 
of the high places. 33They feared the 
LORD, and served their own gods, after 
the manner of the nations from among 
whom they had been carried away. 

34Unto this day they do after the 
former manners: they fear not the 
LORD, neither do they after their 
statutes, or after their ordinances, or 
after the law or after the 
commandment which the LORD 
commanded the children of Jacob, 
whom He named Israel; 35with whom 
the LORD had made a covenant, and 
charged them, saying: ‘Ye shall not 
fear other gods, nor bow down to 
them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to 
them; 36but the LORD, who brought you 
up out of the land of Egypt with great 
power and with an outstretched arm, 
Him shall ye fear, and Him shall ye 
worship, and to Him shall ye sacrifice; 
37and the statutes and the ordinances, 
and the law and the commandment, 
which He wrote for you, ye shall 
observe to do for evermore; and ye 
shall not fear other gods; 38and the 
covenant that I have made with you ye 
shall not forget; neither shall ye fear 
other gods; 39but the LORD your God 
shall ye fear; and He will deliver you 
out of the hand of all your enemies.’ 
40Howbeit they did not hearken, but 
they did after their former manner. 
41So these nations feared the LORD, and 
served their graven images; their 
children likewise, and their children’s 
children, as did their fathers, so do 
they unto this day. 

18 



Now it came to pass in the 
third year of Hoshea son of 
Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the 
son of Ahaz king of Judah began to 
reign. 2Twenty and five years old was 
he when he began to reign; and he 
reigned twenty and nine years in 
Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was 
Abi the daughter of Zechariah. 3And 
he did that which was right in the eyes 
of the LORD, according to all that 
David his father had done. 4He 
removed the high places, and broke the 
pillars, and cut down the Asherah; and 
he broke in pieces the brazen serpent 
that Moses had made; for unto those 
days the children of Israel did offer to 
it; and it was called aNehushtan. 5He 
trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel; 

a That is, A thing of brass. 


so that after him was none like him 
among all the kings of Judah, nor 
among them that were before him. 
6For he cleaved to the LORD, he 
departed not from following Him, but 
kept His commandments, which the 
LORD commanded Moses. 7And the 
LORD was with him: whithersoever he 
went forth he prospered; and he 
rebelled against the king of Assyria, 
and served him not. 8He smote the 
Philistines unto Gaza and the borders 
thereof, from the tower of the 
watchmen to the fortified city. 9And it 
came to pass in the fourth year of king 
Hezekiah, which was the seventh year 
of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, 
that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came 
up against Samaria, and besieged it. 
10And at the end of three years they 
took it; even in the sixth year of 
Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of 
Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was 
taken. 11And the king of Assyria 
carried Israel away unto Assyria, and 
put them in Halah, and in Habor, on 
the river of Gozan, and in the cities of 
the Medes; 12because they hearkened 
not to the voice of the LORD their God, 
but transgressed His covenant, even all 
that Moses the servant of the LORD 
commanded, and would not hear it, 
nor do it. 

13Now in the fourteenth year of king 
Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of 
Assyria come up against all the 
fortified cities of Judah, and took 
them. 14And Hezekiah king of Judah 
sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, 
saying: ‘I have offended; return from 
me; that which thou puttest on me will 
I bear.’ And the king of Assyria 
appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah 
three hundred talents of silver and 
thirty talents of gold. 15And Hezekiah 
gave him all the silver that was found 
in the house of the LORD, and in the 
treasures of the king’s house. 16At that 
time did Hezekiah cut off the gold 
from the doors of the temple of the 
LORD, and from the door-posts which 
Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, 
and gave it to the king of Assyria. 

17And the king of Assyria sent 
aTartan and bRab-saris and cRab-
shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah 
with a great army unto Jerusalem. And 
they went up and came to Jerusalem. 
And when they were come up, they 
came and stood by the conduit of the 
upper pool, which is in the highway of 
the fullers’field. 18And when they had 
called to the king, there came out to 
them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who 
was over the household, and Shebnah 
the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph 
the recorder. 

a That is, commander-in-chief. 

b That is, chief of the eunuchs. 

c That is, chief butler. 

19And Rab-shakeh said unto them: 
‘Say ye now to Hezekiah: Thus saith 
the great king, the king of Assyria: 
What confidence is this wherein thou 
trustest? 20Sayest thou that a mere 
word of the lips is counsel and strength 
for the war? Now on whom dost thou 


trust, that thou hast rebelled against 
me? 21Now, behold, thou trustest upon 
the staff of this bruised reed, even 
upon Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it 
will go into his hand, and pierce it; so 
is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that 
trust on him. 22But if ye say unto me: 
We trust in the LORD our God; is not 
that He, whose high places and whose 
altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and 
hath said to Judah and to Jerusalem: 
Ye shall worship before this altar in 
Jerusalem? 23Now therefore, I pray 
thee, make a wager with my master the 
king of Assyria, and I will give thee 
two thousand horses, if thou be able on 
thy part to set riders upon them. 24How 
then canst thou turn away the face of 
one captain, even of the least of my 
masters servants? and yet thou puttest 
thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for 
horsemen! 25Am I now come up 
without the LORD against this place to 
destroy it? The LORD said unto me: Go 
up against this land, destroy it.’ 

26Then said Eliakim the son of 
Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, unto 
Rab-shakeh: ‘Speak, I pray thee, to thy 
servants in the Aramean language; for 
we understand it; and speak not with 
us in the Jews’language, in the ears of 
the people that are on the wall.’ 27But 
Rab-shakeh said unto them: ‘Hath my 
master sent me to thy master, and to 
thee, to speak these words? hath he not 
sent me to the men that sit on the wall, 
to eat their own dung, and to drink 
their own water with you?’ 28Then 
Rab-shakeh stood, and cried with a 
loud voice in the Jews’language, and 
spoke, saying: ‘Hear ye the word of 
the great king, the king of Assyria. 
29Thus saith the king: Let not Hezekiah 
beguile you; for he will not be able to 
deliver you out of his hand; 30neither 
let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
LORD, saying: The LORD will surely 
deliver us, and this city shall not be 
given into the hand of the king of 
Assyria. 31Hearken not to Hezekiah; 
for thus saith the king of Assyria: 
Make your peace with me, and come 
out to me; and eat ye every one of his 
vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and 
drink ye every one the waters of his 
own cistern; 32until I come and take 
you away to a land like your own land, 
a land of corn and wine, a land of 
bread and vineyards, a land of olive-
trees and of honey, that ye may live, 
and not die; and hearken not unto 
Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, 
saying: The LORD will deliver us. 
33Hath any of the gods of the nations 
ever delivered his land out of the hand 
of the king of Assyria? 34Where are the 
gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where 
are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, 
and Ivvah? have they delivered 
Samaria out of my hand? 35Who are 
they among all the gods of the 
countries, that have delivered their 
country out of my hand, that the LORD 
should deliver Jerusalem out of my 
hand?’ 

36But the people held their peace, 
and answered him not a word; for the 
king’s commandment was, saying: 


‘Answer him not.’ 37Then came 
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was 
over the household, and Shebna the 
scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the 
recorder, to Hezekiah with their 
clothes rent, and told him the words of 
Rab-shakeh. 

And it came to pass, when 
king Hezekiah heard it, that he 
rent his clothes, and covered himself 
with sackcloth, and went into the 
house of the LORD. 2And he sent 
Eliakim, who was over the household, 
and Shebna the scribe, and the elders 
of the priests, covered with sackcloth, 
unto Isaiah the prophet the son of 
Amoz. 3And they said unto him: ‘Thus 
saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of 
trouble, and of rebuke, and of 
contumely; for the children are come 
to the birth, and there is not strength to 
bring forth. 4It may be the LORD thy 
God will hear all the words of Rab-
shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his 
master hath sent to taunt the living 
God, and will rebuke the words which 
the LORD thy God hath heard; 
wherefore make prayer for the remnant 
that is left.’ 5So the servants of king 
Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 6And Isaiah 
said unto them: ‘Thus shall ye say to 
your master: Thus saith the LORD: Be 
not afraid of the words that thou hast 
heard, wherewith the servants of the 
king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. 
7Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and 
he shall hear a rumour, and shall return 
to his own land; and I will cause him 
to fall by the sword in his own land.’ 

8So Rab-shakeh returned, and found 
the king of Assyria warring against 
Libnah; for he had heard that he was 
departed from Lachish. 9And when he 
heard say of Tirhakah king of 
Ethiopia: ‘Behold, he is come out to 
fight against thee’; he sent messengers 
again unto Hezekiah, saying: 10’Thus 
shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of 
Judah, saying: Let not thy God in 
whom thou trustest beguile thee, 
saying: Jerusalem shall not be given 
into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
11Behold, thou hast heard what the 
kings of Assyria have done to all 
lands, by destroying them utterly; and 
shalt thou be delivered? 12Have the 
gods of the nations delivered them, 
which my fathers have destroyed, 
Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and 
the children of Eden that were in 
Telassar? 13Where is the king of 
Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and 
the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of 
Hena, and Ivvah?’ 

14And Hezekiah received the letter 
from the hand of the messengers, and 
read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the 
house of the LORD, and spread it before 
the LORD. 15And Hezekiah prayed 
before the LORD, and said: ‘O LORD, the 
God of Israel, that sittest upon the 
cherubim, Thou art the God, even 
Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the 
earth; Thou hast made heaven and 
earth. 16Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and 
hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and 
see; and hear the words of 
Sennacherib, wherewith he hath sent 
19 




him to taunt the living God. 17Of a 
truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have 
laid waste the nations and their lands, 
18and have cast their gods into the fire; 
for they were no gods, but the work of 
men’s hands, wood and stone; 
therefore they have destroyed them. 
19Now therefore, O LORD our God, 
save Thou us, I beseech Thee, out of 
his hand, that all the kingdoms of the 
earth may know that Thou art the LORD 
God, even Thou only.’ 

20Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent 
to Hezekiah, saying: ‘Thus saith the 
LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou 
hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib 
king of Assyria, I have heard thee. 
21This is the word that the LORD hath 
spoken concerning him: 

The virgin daughter of Zion 

Hath despised thee and laughed thee 
to scorn; 

The daughter of Jerusalem 

Hath shaken her head at thee. 

22Whom hast thou taunted and 

Blasphemed? 

And against whom hast thou exalted 
thy voice? 

Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes 
on high, 

Even against the Holy One of Israel! 

23By the messengers thou hast 
taunted the Lord, 

And hast said: With the multitude of 
my chariots 

Am I come up to the height of the 
mountains, 

To the innermost parts of Lebanon; 

And I have cut down the tall cedars 

 thereof, 

And the choice cypresses thereof; 
and I have entered into his 
farthest lodge, 

The forest of his fruitful field. 

24I have digged and drunk 

Strange waters, 

And with the sole of my feet have I 
dried up 

All the rivers of Egypt. 

 

25Hast thou not heard? 

Long ago I made it, 

In ancient times I fashioned it; 

Now have I brought it to pass, 

Yea, it is done; that fortified cities 

Should be laid waste into ruinous 
heaps. 

26Therefore their inhabitants were of 
small power, 

They were dismayed and 
confounded; 

They were as the grass of the field, 

And as the green herb, 

As the grass on the housetops, 

And as corn blasted before it is 
grown up. 

 

27But I know thy sitting down, and 
thy going out, and thy coming in, 

And thy raging against Me. 

28Because of thy raging against Me, 

And for that thy tumult is come up 
into 

Mine ears, 

Therefore will I put My hook in thy 
nose, 

And My bridle in thy lips, 

And I will turn thee back by the way 


By which thou camest. 

29And this shall be the sign unto 
thee: ye shall eat this year that which 
groweth of itself, and in the second 
year that which springeth of the same; 
and in the third year sow ye, and reap, 
and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit 
thereof. 30And the remnant that is 
escaped of the house of Judah shall 
again take root downward, and bear 
fruit upward. 31For out of Jerusalem 
shall go forth a remnant, and out of 
mount Zion they that shall escape; the 
zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform 
this. 32Therefore thus saith the LORD 
concerning the king of Assyria: He 
shall not come unto this city, nor shoot 
an arrow there, neither shall he come 
before it with shield, nor cast a mound 
against it. 33By the way that he came, 
by the same shall he return, and he 
shall not come unto this city, saith the 
LORD. 34For I will defend this city to 
save it, for Mine own sake, and for My 
servant David’s sake.’ 

35And it came to pass that night, that 
the angel of the LORD went forth, and 
smote in the camp of the Assyrians a 
hundred fourscore and five thousand; 
and when men arose early in the 
morning, behold, they were all dead 
corpses. 36So Sennacherib king of 
Assyria departed, and went and 
returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 37And 
it came to pass, as he was worshipping 
in the house of Nisroch his god, that 
Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons 
smote him with the sword; and they 
escaped into the land of Ararat. And 
Esarhaddon his son reigned in his 
stead. 

In those days was Hezekiah 
sick unto death. And Isaiah the 
prophet the son of Amoz came to him, 
and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the 
LORD: Set thy house in order; for thou 
shalt die, and not live.’ 2Then he 
turned his face to the wall, and prayed 
unto the LORD, saying: 3’Remember 
now, O LORD, I beseech Thee, how I 
have walked before Thee in truth and 
with a whole heart, and have done that 
which is good in Thy sight.’ And 
Hezekiah wept sore. 4And it came to 
pass, before Isaiah was gone out of the 
inner court of the city, that the word of 
the LORD came to him, saying: 
5’Return, and say to Hezekiah the 
prince of My people: Thus saith the 
LORD, the God of David thy father: I 
have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy 
tears; behold, I will heal thee; on the 
third day thou shalt go up unto the 
house of the LORD. 6And I will add 
unto thy days fifteen years; and I will 
deliver thee and this city out of the 
hand of the king of Assyria; and I will 
defend this city for Mine own sake, 
and for My servant David’s sake.’ 
7And Isaiah said: ‘Take a cake of figs.’ 
And they took and laid it on the boil, 
and he recovered. 

8And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah: 
‘What shall be the sign that the LORD 
will heal me, and that I shall go up 
unto the house of the LORD the third 
day?’ 9And Isaiah said: ‘This shall be 
the sign unto thee from the LORD, that 
20 




the LORD will do the thing that He hath 
spoken: shall the shadow go forward 
ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? 
10And Hezekiah answered: ‘It is a light 
thing for the shadow to decline ten 
degrees; nay, but let the shadow return 
backward ten degrees.’ 11And Isaiah 
the prophet cried unto the LORD; and 
he brought the shadow ten degrees 
backward, by which it had gone down 
on the dial of Ahaz. 

12At that time Berodach-baladan the 
son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent 
a letter and a present unto Hezekiah; 
for he had heard that Hezekiah had 
been sick. 13And Hezekiah hearkened 
unto them, and showed them all his 
treasure-house, the silver, and the 
gold, and the spices, and the precious 
oil, and the house of his armour, and 
all that was found in his treasures; 
there was nothing in his house, nor in 
all his dominion, that Hezekiah 
showed them not. 14Then came Isaiah 
the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and 
said unto him: ‘What said these men? 
and from whence came they unto 
thee?’ And Hezekiah said: ‘They are 
come from a far country, even from 
Babylon.’ 15And he said: ‘What have 
they seen in thy house?’ And Hezekiah 
answered: ‘All that is in my house 
have they seen; there is nothing among 
my treasures that I have not shown 
them.’ 

16And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah: 
‘Hear the word of the LORD. 17Behold, 
the days come, that all that is in thy 
house, and that which thy fathers have 
laid up in store unto this day, shall be 
carried to Babylon; nothing shall be 
left, saith the LORD. 18And of thy sons 
that shall issue from thee, whom thou 
shalt beget, shall they take away; and 
they shall be officers in the palace of 
the king of Babylon.’ 19Then said 
Hezekiah unto Isaiah: ‘Good is the 
word of the LORD which thou hast 
spoken.’ He said moreover: ‘Is it not 
so, if peace and truth shall be in my 
days?’ 

20Now the rest of the acts of 
Hezekiah, and all his might, and how 
he made the pool, and the conduit, and 
brought water into the city, are they 
not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
21And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; 
and Manasseh his son reigned in his 
stead. 

 

Manasseh was twelve years 
old when he began to reign; 
and he reigned five and fifty years in 
Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was 
Hephzi-bah. 2And he did that which 
was evil in the sight of the LORD, after 
the abominations of the nations, whom 
the LORD cast out before the children 
of Israel. 3For he built again the high 
places which Hezekiah his father had 
destroyed; and he reared up altars for 
Baal, and made an Asherah, as did 
Ahab king of Israel, and worshipped 
all the host of heaven, and served 
them. 4And he built altars in the house 
of the LORD, whereof the LORD said: ‘In 
Jerusalem will I put My name.’ 5And 
21 




he built altars for all the host of heaven 
in the two courts of the house of the 
LORD. 6And he made his son to pass 
through the fire, and practised 
soothsaying, and used enchantments, 
and appointed them that divined by a 
ghost or a familiar spirit: he wrought 
much evil in the sight of the LORD, to 
provoke Him. 7And he set the graven 
image of Asherah, that he had made, in 
the house of which the LORD said to 
David and to Solomon his son: ‘In this 
house, and in Jerusalem, which I have 
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, 
will I put My name for ever; 8neither 
will I cause the feet of Israel to wander 
any more out of the land which I gave 
their fathers; if only they will observe 
to do according to all that I have 
commanded them, and according to all 
the law that My servant Moses 
commanded them.’ 9But they 
hearkened not; and Manasseh seduced 
them to do that which is evil more than 
did the nations, whom the LORD 
destroyed before the children of Israel. 

10And the LORD spoke by His 
servants the prophets, saying: 
11’Because Manasseh king of Judah 
hath done these abominations, and 
hath done wickedly above all that the 
Amorites did, that were before him, 
and hath made Judah also to sin with 
his idols; 12therefore thus saith the 
LORD, the God of Israel: Behold, I 
bring such evil upon Jerusalem and 
Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, 
both his ears shall tingle. 13And I will 
stretch over Jerusalem the line of 
Samaria, and the plummet of the house 
of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as 
a man wipeth a dish, wiping it and 
turning it upside down. 14And I will 
cast off the remnant of Mine 
inheritance, and deliver them into the 
hand of their enemies; and they shall 
become a prey and a spoil to all their 
enemies; 15because they have done that 
which is evil in My sight, and have 
provoked Me, since the day their 
fathers came forth out of Egypt, even 
unto this day.’ 

16Moreover Manasseh shed innocent 
blood very much, till he had filled 
Jerusalem from one end to another; 
beside his sin wherewith he made 
Judah to sin, in doing that which was 
evil in the sight of the LORD. 17Now the 
rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all 
that he did, and his sin that he sinned, 
are they not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
18And Manasseh slept with his fathers, 
and was buried in the garden of his 
own house, in the garden of Uzza; and 
Amon his son reigned in his stead. 

19Amon was twenty and two years 
old when he began to reign; and he 
reigned two years in Jerusalem; and 
his mother’s name was Meshullemeth 
the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 20And 
he did that which was evil in the sight 
of the LORD, as did Manasseh his 
father. 21And he walked in all the way 
that his father walked in, and served 
the idols that his father served, and 
worshipped them. 22And he forsook 
the LORD, the God of his fathers, and 


walked not in the way of the LORD. 
23And the servants of Amon conspired 
against him, and put the king to death 
in his own house. 24But the people of 
the land slew all them that had 
conspired against king Amon; and the 
people of the land made Josiah his son 
king in his stead. 25Now the rest of the 
acts of Amon which he did, are they 
not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
26And he was buried in his sepulchre 
in the garden of Uzza; and Josiah his 
son reigned in his stead. 

Josiah was eight years old 
when he began to reign; and 
he reigned thirty and one years in 
Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was 
Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of 
Bozkath. 2And he did that which was 
right in the eyes of the LORD, and 
walked in all the way of David his 
father, and turned not aside to the right 
hand or to the left. 

3And it came to pass in the 
eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the 
king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, 
the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to 
the house of the LORD, saying. 4’Go up 
to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may 
sum the money which is brought into 
the house of the LORD, which the 
keepers of the door have gathered of 
the people; 5and let them deliver it into 
the hand of the workmen that have the 
oversight of the house of the LORD; and 
let them give it to the workmen that 
are in the house of the LORD, to repair 
the breaches of the house; 6unto the 
carpenters, and to the builders, and to 
the masons; and for buying timber and 
hewn stone to repair the house.’— 
7Howbeit there was no reckoning 
made with them of the money that was 
delivered into their hand; for they dealt 
faithfully. 

8And Hilkiah the high priest said 
unto Shaphan the scribe: ‘I have found 
the book of the Law in the house of the 
LORD.’ And Hilkiah delivered the book 
to Shaphan, and he read it. 9And 
Shaphan the scribe came to the king, 
and brought back word unto the king, 
and said: ‘Thy servants have poured 
out the money that was found in the 
house, and have delivered it into the 
hand of the workmen that have the 
oversight of the house of the LORD.’ 
10And Shaphan the scribe told the 
king, saying: ‘Hilkiah the priest hath 
delivered me a book.’ And Shaphan 
read it before the king. 11And it came 
to pass, when the king had heard the 
words of the book of the Law, that he 
rent his clothes. 12And the king 
commanded Hilkiah the priest, and 
Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and 
Achbor the son of Micaiah, and 
Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the 
king’s servant, saying: 13’Go ye, 
inquire of the LORD for me, and for the 
people, and for all Judah, concerning 
the words of this book that is found; 
for great is the wrath of the LORD that 
is kindled against us, because our 
fathers have not hearkened unto the 
words of this book, to do according 
22 




unto all that which is written 
concerning us.’ 

14So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, 
and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, 
went unto Huldah the prophetess, the 
wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the 
son of Harhas, keeper of the 
wardrobe—now she dwelt in 
Jerusalem in the second quarter—and 
they spoke with her. 15And she said 
unto them: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the 
God of Israel: Tell ye the man that sent 
you unto me: 16Thus saith the LORD: 
Behold, I will bring evil upon this 
place, and upon the inhabitants 
thereof, even all the words of the book 
which the king of Judah hath read; 
17because they have forsaken Me, and 
have offered unto other gods, that they 
might provoke Me with all the work of 
their hands; therefore My wrath shall 
be kindled against this place, and it 
shall not be quenched. 18But unto the 
king of Judah, who sent you to inquire 
of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him: 
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: 
As touching the words which thou hast 
heard, 19because thy heart was tender, 
and thou didst humble thyself before 
the LORD, when thou heardest what I 
spoke against this place, and against 
the inhabitants thereof, that they 
should become an astonishment and a 
curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and 
wept before Me, I also have heard 
thee, saith the LORD. 20Therefore, 
behold, I will gather thee to thy 
fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to 
thy grave in peace, neither shall thine 
eyes see all the evil which I will bring 
upon this place.’ And they brought 
back word unto the king. 

And the king sent, and they 
gathered unto him all the 
elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. 2And 
the king went up to the house of the 
LORD, and all the men of Judah and all 
the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, 
and the priests, and the prophets, and 
all the people, both small and great; 
and he read in their ears all the words 
of the book of the covenant which was 
found in the house of the LORD. 3And 
the king stood on the platform, and 
made a covenant before the LORD, to 
walk after the LORD, and to keep His 
commandments, and His testimonies, 
and His statutes, with all his heart, and 
all his soul, to confirm the words of 
this covenant that were written in this 
book; and all the people stood to the 
covenant. 

4And the king commanded Hilkiah 
the high priest, and the priests of the 
second order, and the keepers of the 
door, to bring forth out of the temple 
of the LORD all the vessels that were 
made for Baal, and for the Asherah, 
and for all the host of heaven; and he 
burned them without Jerusalem in the 
fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes 
of them unto Beth-el. 5And he put 
down the idolatrous priests, whom the 
kings of Judah had ordained to offer in 
the high places in the cities of Judah, 
and in the places round about 
Jerusalem; them also that offered unto 
Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and 
23 




to the constellations, and to all the host 
of heaven. 6And he brought out the 
Asherah from the house of the LORD, 
without Jerusalem, unto the brook 
Kidron, and burned it at the brook 
Kidron, and stamped it small to 
powder, and cast the powder thereof 
upon the graves of the common 
people. 7And he broke down the 
houses of the sodomites, that were in 
the house of the LORD, where the 
women wove coverings for the 
Asherah. 8And he brought all the 
priests out of the cities of Judah, and 
defiled the high places where the 
priests had made offerings, from Geba 
to Beer-sheba; and he broke down the 
high places of the gates that were at 
the entrance of the gate of Joshua the 
governor of the city, which were on a 
man’s left hand as he entered the gate 
of the city. 9Nevertheless the priests of 
the high places came not up to the altar 
of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did 
eat unleavened bread among their 
brethren. 10And he defiled Topheth, 
which is in the valley of the son of 
Hinnom, that no man might make his 
son or his daughter to pass through the 
fire to Molech. 11And he took away the 
horses that the kings of Judah had 
given to the sun, at the entrance of the 
house of the LORD, by the chamber of 
Nethan-melech the officer, which was 
in the precincts; and he burned the 
chariots of the sun with fire. 12And the 
altars that were on the roof of the 
upper chamber of Ahaz, which the 
kings of Judah had made, and the 
altars which Manasseh had made in 
the two courts of the house of the 
LORD, did the king break down, and 
beat them down from thence, and cast 
the dust of them into the brook Kidron. 
13And the high places that were before 
Jerusalem, which were on the right 
hand of the mount of corruption, 
which Solomon the king of Israel had 
builded for Ashtoreth the detestation 
of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the 
detestation of Moab, and for Milcom 
the abomination of the children of 
Ammon, did the king defile. 14And he 
broke in pieces the pillars, and cut 
down the Asherim, and filled their 
places with the bones of men. 

15Moreover the altar that was at 
Beth-el, and the high place which 
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made 
Israel to sin, had made, even that altar 
and the high place he broke down; and 
he burned the high place and stamped 
it small to powder, and burned the 
Asherah. 16And as Josiah turned 
himself, he spied the sepulchres that 
were there in the mount; and he sent, 
and took the bones out of the 
sepulchres, and burned them upon the 
altar, and defiled it, according to the 
word of the LORD which the man of 
God proclaimed, who proclaimed 
these things. 17Then he said: ‘What 
monument is that which I see’And the 
men of the city told him: ‘It is the 
sepulchre of the man of God, who 
came from Judah, and proclaimed 
these things that thou hast done against 
the altar of Beth-el.’ 18And he said: 


‘Let him be; let no man move his 
bones.’ So they let his bones alone, 
with the bones of the prophet that 
came out of Samaria. 19And all the 
houses also of the high places that 
were in the cities of Samaria, which 
the kings of Israel had made to 
provoke [the LORD], Josiah took away, 
and did to them according to all the 
acts that he had done in Beth-el. 20And 
he slew all the priests of the high 
places that were there, upon the altars, 
and burned men’s bones upon them; 
and he returned to Jerusalem. 

21And the king commanded all the 
people, saying: ‘Keep the passover 
unto the LORD your God, as it is 
written in this book of the covenant.’ 
22For there was not kept such a 
passover from the days of the judges 
that judged Israel, nor in all the days of 
the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of 
Judah; 23but in the eighteenth year of 
king Josiah was this passover kept to 
the LORD in Jerusalem. 24Moreover 
them that divined by a ghost or a 
familiar spirit, and the teraphim, and 
the idols, and all the detestable things 
that were spied in the land of Judah 
and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, 
that he might confirm the words of the 
law which were written in the book 
that Hilkiah the priest found in the 
house of the LORD. 25And like unto him 
was there no king before him, that 
turned to the LORD with all his heart, 
and with all his soul, and with all his 
might, according to all the law of 
Moses; neither after him arose there 
any like him. 

26Notwithstanding the LORD turned 
not from the fierceness of His great 
wrath, wherewith His anger was 
kindled against Judah, because of all 
the provocations wherewith Manasseh 
had provoked Him. 27And the LORD 
said: ‘I will remove Judah also out of 
My sight, as I have removed Israel, 
and I will cast off this city which I 
have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the 
house of which I said: My name shall 
be there.’ 

28Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, 
and all that he did, are they not written 
in the book of the chronicles of the 
kings of Judah? 29In his days Pharaoh-
necoh king of Egypt went up against 
the king of Assyria to the river 
Euphrates; and king Josiah went 
against him; and he slew him at 
Megiddo, when he had seen him. 
30And his servants carried him in a 
chariot dead from Megiddo, and 
brought him to Jerusalem, and buried 
him in his own sepulchre. And the 
people of the land took Jehoahaz the 
son of Josiah, and anointed him, and 
made him king in his father’s stead. 

31Jehoahaz was twenty and three 
years old when he began to reign; and 
he reigned three months in Jerusalem; 
and his mother’s name was Hamutal 
the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
32And he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the LORD, according to all that 
his fathers had done. 33And Pharaoh-
necoh put him in bands at Riblah in 


the land of Hamath, that he might not 
reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to 
a fine of a hundred talents of silver, 
and a talent of gold. 34And Pharaoh-
necoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah 
king in the room of Josiah his father, 
and changed his name to Jehoiakim; 
but he took Jehoahaz away; and he 
came to Egypt, and died there. 35And 
Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold 
to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to 
give the money according to the 
commandment of Pharaoh; he exacted 
the silver and the gold of the people of 
the land, of every one according to his 
taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-
necoh. 

36Jehoiakim was twenty and five 
years old when he began to reign; and 
he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; 
and his mother’s name was Zebudah 
the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
37And he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the LORD, according to all that 
his fathers had done. 

In his days Nebuchadnezzar 
king of Babylon came up, and 
Jehoiakim became his servant three 
years; then he turned and rebelled 
against him. 2And the LORD sent 
against him bands of the Chaldeans, 
and bands of the Arameans, and bands 
of the Moabites, and bands of the 
children of Ammon, and sent them 
against Judah to destroy it, according 
to the word of the LORD, which He 
spoke by the hand of His servants the 
prophets. 3Surely at the commandment 
of the LORD came this upon Judah, to 
remove them out of His sight, for the 
sins of Manasseh, according to all that 
he did; 4and also for the innocent 
blood that he shed; for he filled 
Jerusalem with innocent blood; and the 
LORD would not pardon. 

5Now the rest of the acts of 
Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they 
not written in the book of the 
chronicles of the kings of Judah? 6So 
Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and 
Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 
7And the king of Egypt came not again 
any more out of his land; for the king 
of Babylon had taken, from the Brook 
of Egypt unto the river Euphrates, all 
that pertained to the king of Egypt. 

8Jehoiachin was eighteen years old 
when he began to reign; and he 
reigned in Jerusalem three months; and 
his mother’s name was Nehushta the 
daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 
9And he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the LORD, according to all that 
his father had done. 10At that time the 
servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of 
Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the 
city was besieged. 11And 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon 
came unto the city, while his servants 
were besieging it. 12And Jehoiachin the 
king of Judah went out to the king of 
Babylon, he, and his mother, and his 
servants, and his princes, and his 
officers; and the king of Babylon took 
him in the eighth year of his reign. 
13And he carried out thence all the 
treasures of the house of the LORD, and 
the treasures of the king’s house, and 
24 




cut in pieces all the vessels of gold 
which Solomon king of Israel had 
made in the temple of the LORD, as the 
LORD had said. 14And he carried away 
all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and 
all the mighty men of valour, even ten 
thousand captives, and all the 
craftsmen and the smiths; none 
remained, save the poorest sort of the 
people of the land. 15And he carried 
away Jehoiachin to Babylon; and the 
king’s mother, and the king’s wives, 
and his officers, and the chief men of 
the land, carried he into captivity from 
Jerusalem to Babylon. 16And all the 
men of might, even seven thousand, 
and the craftsmen and the smiths a 
thousand, all of them strong and apt 
for war, even them the king of 
Babylon brought captive to Babylon. 
17And the king of Babylon made 
Mattaniah his father’s brother king in 
his stead, and changed his name to 
Zedekiah. 

18Zedekiah was twenty and one 
years old when he began to reign; and 
he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; 
and his mother’s name was Hamutal 
the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
19And he did that which was evil in the 
sight of the LORD, according to all that 
Jehoiakim had done. 20For through the 
anger of the LORD did it come to pass 
in Jerusalem and Judah, until He had 
cast them out from His presence. 
And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 



And it came 
to pass in the ninth year of his 
reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth 
day of the month, that 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon 
came, he and all his army, against 
Jerusalem, and encamped against it; 
and they built forts against it round 
about. 2So the city was besieged unto 
the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
3On the ninth day of the [fourth] 
month the famine was sore in the city, 
so that there was no bread for the 
people of the land. 4Then a breach was 
made in the city, and all the men of 
war [fled] by night by the way of the 
gate between the two walls, which was 
by the king’s garden—now the 
Chaldeans were against the city round 
about—and the king went by the way 
of the Arabah. 5But the army of the 
Chaldeans pursued after the king, and 
overtook him in the plains of Jericho; 
and all his army was scattered from 
him. 6Then they took the king, and 
carried him up unto the king of 
Babylon to Riblah; and they gave 
judgment upon him. 7And they slew 
the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, 
and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and 
bound him in fetters, and carried him 
to Babylon. 

8Now in the fifth month, on the 
seventh day of the month, which was 
the nineteenth year of king 
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, 
came Nebuzaradan the captain of the 
guard, a servant of the king of 
Babylon, unto Jerusalem. 9And he 
burnt the house of the LORD, and the 
king’s house; and all the houses of 
Jerusalem, even every great man’s 
25 




house, burnt he with fire. 10And all the 
army of the Chaldeans, that were with 
the captain of the guard, broke down 
the walls of Jerusalem round about. 
11And the residue of the people that 
were left in the city, and those that fell 
away, that fell to the king of Babylon, 
and the residue of the multitude, did 
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard 
carry away captive. 12But the captain 
of the guard left of the poorest of the 
land to be vinedressers and 
husbandmen. 

13And the pillars of brass that were 
in the house of the LORD, and the bases 
and the brazen sea that were in the 
house of the LORD, did the Chaldeans 
break in pieces, and carried the brass 
of them to Babylon. 14And the pots, 
and the shovels, and the snuffers, and 
the pans, and all the vessels of brass 
wherewith they ministered, took they 
away. 15And the fire-pans, and the 
basins, that which was of gold, in gold, 
and that which was of silver, in silver, 
the captain of the guard took away. 
16The two pillars, the one sea, and the 
bases, which Solomon had made for 
the house of the LORD; the brass of all 
these vessels was without weight. 
17The height of the one pillar was 
eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass 
was upon it; and the height of the 
capital was three cubits; with network 
and pomegranates upon the capital 
round about, all of brass; and like unto 
these had the second pillar with 
network. 

18And the captain of the guard took 
Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah 
the second priest, and the three keepers 
of the door; 19and out of the city he 
took an officer that was set over the 
men of war; and five men of them that 
saw the king’s face, who were found 
in the city; and the scribe of the 
captain of the host, who mustered the 
people of the land; and threescore men 
of the people of the land, that were 
found in the city. 20And Nebuzaradan 
the captain of the guard took them, and 
brought them to the king of Babylon to 
Riblah. 21And the king of Babylon 
smote them, and put them to death at 
Riblah in the land of Hamath. So 
Judah was carried away captive out of 
his land. 22And as for the people that 
were left in the land of Judah, whom 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had 
left, even over them he made Gedaliah 
the son of Ahikam, the son of 
Shaphan, governor. 

23Now when all the captains of the 
forces, they and their men, heard that 
the king of Babylon had made 
Gedaliah governor, they came to 
Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the 
son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son 
of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of 
Tanhumeth the Netophathite and 
Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, 
they and their men. 24And Gedaliah 
swore to them and to their men, and 
said unto them: ‘Fear not because of 
the servants of the Chaldeans; dwell in 
the land, and serve the king of 
Babylon, and it shall be well with 


you.’ 25But it came to pass in the 
seventh month, that Ishmael the son of 
Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the 
seed royal, came, and ten men with 
him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, 
and the Jews and the Chaldeans that 
were with him at Mizpah. 26And all the 
people, both small and great, and the 
captains of the forces, arose, and came 
to Egypt; for they were afraid of the 
Chaldeans. 

27And it came to pass in the seven 
and thirtieth year of the captivity of 
Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the 
twelfth month, on the seven and 
twentieth day of the month, that Evil-
merodach king of Babylon, in the year 
that he began to reign, did lift up the 
head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out 
of prison. 28And he spoke kindly to 
him, and set his throne above the 
throne of the kings that were with him 
in Babylon. 29And he changed his 
prison garments, and did eat bread 
before him continually all the days of 
his life. 30And for his allowance, there 
was a continual allowance given him 
of the king, every day a portion, all the 
days of his life.
