GENESIS 

 

In the beginning God created the 
heaven and the earth. 2Now the 
earth was unformed and void, and 
darkness was upon the face of the 
deep; and the spirit of God hovered 
over the face of the waters. 3And God 
said: ‘Let there be light.’ And there 
was light. 4And God saw the light, that 
it was good; and God divided the light 
from the darkness. 5And God called 
the light Day, and the darkness He 
called Night. And there was evening 
and there was morning, one day. 

6And God said: ‘Let there be a 
firmament in the midst of the waters, 
and let it divide the waters from the 
waters.’ 7And God made the 
firmament, and divided the waters 
which were under the firmament from 
the waters which were above the 
firmament; and it was so. 8And God 
called the firmament Heaven. And 
there was evening and there was 
morning, a second day. 

9And God said: ‘Let the waters 
under the heaven be gathered together 
unto one place, and let the dry land 
appear.’ And it was so. 10And God 
called the dry land Earth, and the 
gathering together of the waters called 
He Seas; and God saw that it was 
good. 11And God said: ‘Let the earth 
put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and 
fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind, 
wherein is the seed thereof, upon the 
earth.’ And it was so. 12And the earth 
brought forth grass, herb yielding seed 
after its kind, and tree bearing fruit, 
wherein is the seed thereof, after its 
kind; and God saw that it was good. 
13And there was evening and there was 
morning, a third day. 

14And God said: ‘Let there be lights 
in the firmament of the heaven to 
divide the day from the night; and let 
them be for signs, and for seasons, and 
for days and years; 15and let them be 
for lights in the firmament of the 
heaven to give light upon the earth.’ 
And it was so. 16And God made the 
two great lights: the greater light to 
rule the day, and the lesser light to rule 
the night; and the stars. 17And God set 
them in the firmament of the heaven to 
give light upon the earth, 18and to rule 
over the day and over the night, and to 
divide the light from the darkness; and 
God saw that it was good. 19And there 
was evening and there was morning, a 
fourth day. 

20And God said: ‘Let the waters 
swarm with swarms of living 
creatures, and let fowl fly above the 
earth in the open firmament of 
heaven.’ 21And God created the great 
sea-monsters, and every living creature 
that creepeth, wherewith the waters 
swarmed, after its kind, and every 
winged fowl after its kind; and God 
saw that it was good. 22And God 
1 




blessed them, saying: ‘Be fruitful, and 
multiply, and fill the waters in the 
seas, and let fowl multiply in the 
earth.’ 23And there was evening and 
there was morning, a fifth day. 

24And God said: ‘Let the earth bring 
forth the living creature after its kind, 
cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of 
the earth after its kind.’ And it was so. 
25And God made the beast of the earth 
after its kind, and the cattle after their 
kind, and every thing that creepeth 
upon the ground after its kind; and 
God saw that it was good. 26And God 
said: ‘Let us make man in our image, 
after our likeness; and let them have 
dominion over the fish of the sea, and 
over the fowl of the air, and over the 
cattle, and over all the earth, and over 
every creeping thing that creepeth 
upon the earth.’ 27And God created 
man in His own image, in the image of 
God created He him; male and female 
created He them. 28And God blessed 
them; and God said unto them: ‘Be 
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish 
the earth, and subdue it; and have 
dominion over the fish of the sea, and 
over the fowl of the air, and over every 
living thing that creepeth upon the 
earth.’ 29And God said: ‘Behold, I 
have given you every herb yielding 
seed, which is upon the face of all the 
earth, and every tree, in which is the 
fruit of a tree yielding seed—to you it 
shall be for food; 30and to every beast 
of the earth, and to every fowl of the 
air, and to every thing that creepeth 
upon the earth, wherein there is a 
living soul, [I have given] every green 
herb for food.’ And it was so. 31And 
God saw every thing that He had 
made, and, behold, it was very good. 
And there was evening and there was 
morning, the sixth day. 

And the heaven and the earth 
were finished, and all the host of 
them. 2And on the seventh day God 
finished His work which He had made; 
and He rested on the seventh day from 
all His work which He had made. 3And 
God blessed the seventh day, and 
hallowed it; because that in it He 
rested from all His work which God in 
creating had made. 

4These are the generations of the 
heaven and of the earth when they 
were created, in the day that the LORD 
God made earth and heaven. 

5No shrub of the field was yet in the 
earth, and no herb of the field had yet 
sprung up; for the LORD God had not 
caused it to rain upon the earth, and 
there was not a man to till the ground; 
6but there went up a mist from the 
earth, and watered the whole face of 
the ground. 7Then the LORD God 
formed man of the dust of the ground, 
and breathed into his nostrils the 
breath of life; and man became a living 
soul. 8And the LORD God planted a 
garden eastward, in Eden; and there 
He put the man whom He had formed. 
9And out of the ground made the LORD 
God to grow every tree that is pleasant 
to the sight, and good for food; the tree 
of life also in the midst of the garden, 
and the tree of the knowledge of good 
2 




and evil. 10And a river went out of 
Eden to water the garden; and from 
thence it was parted, and became four 
heads. 11The name of the first is 
Pishon; that is it which compasseth the 
whole land of Havilah, where there is 
gold; 12and the gold of that land is 
good; there is bdellium and the onyx 
stone. 13And the name of the second 
river is Gihon; the same is it that 
compasseth the whole land of Cush. 
14And the name of the third river is 
aTigris; that is it which goeth toward 
the east of Asshur. And the fourth 
river is the Euphrates. 15And the LORD 
God took the man, and put him into 
the garden of Eden to dress it and to 
keep it. 16And the LORD God 
commanded the man, saying: ‘Of 
every tree of the garden thou mayest 
freely eat; 17but of the tree of the 
knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt 
not eat of it; for in the day that thou 
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.’ 

a Heb. Hiddekel. 

18And the LORD God said: ‘It is not 
good that the man should be alone; I 
will make him a help meet for him.’ 
19And out of the ground the LORD God 
formed every beast of the field, and 
every fowl of the air; and brought 
them unto the man to see what he 
would call them; and whatsoever the 
man would call every living creature, 
that was to be the name thereof. 20And 
the man gave names to all cattle, and 
to the fowl of the air, and to every 
beast of the field; but for Adam there 

was not found a help meet for him. 
21And the LORD God caused a deep 
sleep to fall upon the man, and he 
slept; and He took one of his ribs, and 
closed up the place with flesh instead 
thereof. 22And the rib, which the LORD 
God had taken from the man, made He 
a woman, and brought her unto the 
man. 23And the man said: ‘This is now 
bone of my bones, and flesh of my 
flesh; she shall be called bWoman, 
because she was taken out of cMan.’ 
24Therefore shall a man leave his 
father and his mother, and shall cleave 
unto his wife, and they shall be one 
flesh. 25And they were both naked, the 
man and his wife, and were not 
ashamed. 

b Heb. Issahah. 

c Heb. Ish.

Now the serpent was more subtle 
than any beast of the field which 
the LORD God had made. And he said 
unto the woman: ‘Yea, hath God said: 
Ye shall not eat of any tree of the 
garden?’ 2And the woman said unto 
the serpent: ‘Of the fruit of the trees of 
the garden we may eat; 3but of the fruit 
of the tree which is in the midst of the 
garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat 
of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye 
die.’ 4And the serpent said unto the 
woman: ‘Ye shall not surely die; 5for 
God doth know that in the day ye eat 
thereof, then your eyes shall be 
opened, and ye shall be as God, 
knowing good and evil.’ 6And when 
the woman saw that the tree was good 


for food, and that it was a delight to 
the eyes, and that the tree was to be 
desired to make one wise, she took of 
the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she 
gave also unto her husband with her, 
and he did eat. 7And the eyes of them 
both were opened, and they knew that 
they were naked; and they sewed fig-
leaves together, and made themselves 
girdles. 8And they heard the voice of 
the LORD God walking in the garden 
toward the cool of the day; and the 
man and his wife hid themselves from 
the presence of the LORD God amongst 
the trees of the garden. 9And the LORD 
God called unto the man, and said unto 
him: ‘Where art thou?’ 10And he said: 
‘I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I 
was afraid, because I was naked; and I 
hid myself.’ 11And He said: ‘Who told 
thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou 
eaten of the tree, whereof I 
commanded thee that thou shouldest 
not eat?’ 12And the man said: ‘The 
woman whom Thou gavest to be with 
me, she gave me of the tree, and I did 
eat.’ 13And the LORD God said unto the 
woman: ‘What is this thou hast done?’ 
And the woman said: ‘The serpent 
beguiled me, and I did eat.’ 14And the 
LORD God said unto the serpent: 
‘Because thou hast done this, cursed 
art thou from among all cattle, and 
from among all beasts of the field; 
upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust 
shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. 
15And I will put enmity between thee 
and the woman, and between thy seed 
and her seed; they shall bruise thy 
head, and thou shalt bruise their heel.’ 

16Unto the woman He said: ‘I will 
greatly multiply thy pain and thy 
travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth 
children; and thy desire shall be to thy 
husband, and he shall rule over thee.’ 

17And unto Adam He said: ‘Because 
thou hast hearkened unto the voice of 
thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of 
which I commanded thee, saying: 
Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the 
ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou 
eat of it all the days of thy life. 
18Thorns also and thistles shall it bring 
forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the 
herb of the field. 19In the sweat of thy 
face shalt thou eat bread, till thou 
return unto the ground; for out of it 
wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and 
unto dust shalt thou return.’ 20And the 
man called his wife’s name aEve; 
because she was the mother of all 
living. 21And the LORD God made for 
Adam and for his wife garments of 
skins, and clothed them. 

a Heb. Havvah, that is, Life. 

22And the LORD God said: ‘Behold, 
the man is become as one of us, to 
know good and evil; and now, lest he 
put forth his hand, and take also of the 
tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.’ 
23Therefore the LORD God sent him 
forth from the garden of Eden, to till 
the ground from whence he was taken. 
24So He drove out the man; and He 
placed at the east of the garden of 
Eden the cherubim, and the flaming 


sword which turned every way, to 
keep the way to the tree of life. 

4 



And the man knew Eve his wife; 
and she conceived and bore Cain, 
and said: ‘I have agotten a man with 
the help of the LORD.’ 2And again she 
bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a 
keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller 
of the ground. 3And in process of time 
it came to pass, that Cain brought of 
the fruit of the ground an offering unto 
the LORD. 4And Abel, he also brought 
of the firstlings of his flock and of the 
fat thereof. And the LORD had respect 
unto Abel and to his offering; 5but 
unto Cain and to his offering He had 
not respect. And Cain was very wroth, 
and his countenance fell. 6And the 
LORD said unto Cain: ‘Why art thou 
wroth? and why is thy countenance 
fallen? 7If thou doest well, shall it not 
be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, 
sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee 
is its desire, but thou mayest rule over 
it.’ 8And Cain spoke unto Abel his 
brother. And it came to pass, when 
they were in the field, that Cain rose 
up against Abel his brother, and slew 
him. 

a Heb. Kanah, to get. 

9And the LORD said unto Cain: 
‘Where is Abel thy brother?’ And he 
said: ‘I know not; am I my brother’s 
keeper?’ 10And He said: ‘What hast 
thou done? the voice of thy brother’s 
blood crieth unto Me from the ground. 
11And now cursed art thou from the 
ground, which hath opened her mouth 

to receive thy brother’s blood from thy 
hand. 12When thou tillest the ground, it 
shall not henceforth yield unto thee her 
strength; a fugitive and a wanderer 
shalt thou be in the earth.’ 13And Cain 
said unto the LORD: ‘My punishment is 
greater than I can bear. 14Behold, Thou 
hast driven me out this day from the 
face of the land; and from Thy face 
shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive 
and a wanderer in the earth; and it will 
come to pass, that whosoever findeth 
me will slay me.’ 15And the LORD said 
unto him: ‘Therefore whosoever 
slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken 
on him sevenfold.’ And the LORD set a 
sign for Cain, lest any finding him 
should smite him. 

16And Cain went out from the 
presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the 
land of bNod, on the east of Eden. 
17And Cain knew his wife; and she 
conceived, and bore Enoch; and he 
builded a city, and called the name of 
the city after the name of his son 
Enoch. 18And unto Enoch was born 
Irad; and Irad begot cMehujael; and 
Mehujael begot Methushael; and 
Methushael begot Lamech. 19And 
Lamech took unto him two wives; the 
name of one was Adah, and the name 
of the other Zillah. 20And Adah bore 
Jabal; he was the father of such as 
dwell in tents and have cattle. 21And 
his brother’s name was Jubal; he was 
the father of all such as handle the 

b That is, Wandering. 

c Heb. Mehijael. 


harp and pipe. 22And Zillah, she also 
bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every 
cutting instrument of brass and iron; 
and the sister of Tubal-cain was 
Naamah. 23And Lamech said unto his 
wives: 

Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; 

Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto 
my speech; 

For I have slain a man for wounding 
me, 

And a young man for bruising me; 

24If Cain shall be avenged 
sevenfold, 

Truly Lamech seventy and 
sevenfold. 

25And Adam knew his wife again; 
and she bore a son, and called his 
name aSeth: ‘for God bhath appointed 
me another seed instead of Abel; for 
Cain slew him.’ 26And to Seth, to him 
also there was born a son; and he 
called his name Enosh; then began 
men to call upon the name of the LORD. 

a Heb. Sheth. 

b Heb. Shath. 

This is the book of the 
generations of Adam. In the day 
that God created man, in the likeness 
of God made He him; 2male and 
female created He them, and blessed 
them, and called their name Adam, in 
the day when they were created. 3And 
Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, 
and begot a son in his own likeness, 
after his image; and called his name 
Seth. 4And the days of Adam after he 
begot Seth were eight hundred years; 

and he begot sons and daughters. 5And 
all the days that Adam lived were nine 
hundred and thirty years; and he died. 

6And Seth lived a hundred and five 
years, and begot Enosh. 7And Seth 
lived after he begot Enosh eight 
hundred and seven years, and begot 
sons and daughters. 8And all the days 
of Seth were nine hundred and twelve 
years; and he died. 

9And Enosh lived ninety years, and 
begot Kenan. 10And Enosh lived after 
he begot Kenan eight hundred and 
fifteen years, and begot sons and 
daughters. 11And all the days of Enosh 
were nine hundred and five years; and 
he died. 

12And Kenan lived seventy years, 
and begot Mahalalel. 13And Kenan 
lived after he begot Mahalalel eight 
hundred and forty years, and begot 
sons and daughters. 14And all the days 
of Kenan were nine hundred and ten 
years; and he died. 

15And Mahalalel lived sixty and five 
years, and begot Jared. 16And 
Mahalalel lived after he begot Jared 
eight hundred and thirty years, and 
begot sons and daughters. 17And all the 
days of Mahalalel were eight hundred 
ninety and five years; and he died. 

18And Jared lived a hundred sixty 
and two years, and begot Enoch. 19And 
Jared lived after he begot Enoch eight 
hundred years, and begot sons and 
daughters. 20And all the days of Jared 
were nine hundred sixty and two 
years; and he died. 
5 




21And Enoch lived sixty and five 
years, and begot Methuselah. 22And 
Enoch walked with God after he begot 
Methuselah three hundred years, and 
begot sons and daughters. 23And all the 
days of Enoch were three hundred 
sixty and five years. 24And Enoch 
walked with God, and he was not; for 
God took him. 

25And Methuselah lived a hundred 
eighty and seven years, and begot 
Lamech. 26And Methuselah lived after 
he begot Lamech seven hundred eighty 
and two years, and begot sons and 
daughters. 27And all the days of 
Methuselah were nine hundred sixty 
and nine years; and he died. 

28And Lamech lived a hundred 
eighty and two years, and begot a son. 
29And he called his name Noah, 
saying: ‘This same shall acomfort us in 
our work and in the toil of our hands, 
which cometh from the ground which 
the LORD hath cursed.’ 30And Lamech 
lived after he begot Noah five hundred 
ninety and five years, and begot sons 
and daughters. 31And all the days of 
Lamech were seven hundred seventy 
and seven years; and he died. 

a Heb. nahem, to comfort. 

32And Noah was five hundred years 
old; and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and 
Japheth. 

And it came to pass, when men 
began to multiply on the face of 
the earth, and daughters were born 
unto them, 2that the sons of God saw 
the daughters of men that they were 

fair; and they took them wives, 
whomsoever they chose. 3And the 
LORD said: ‘My spirit shall not abide in 
man for ever, for that he also is flesh; 
therefore shall his days be a hundred 
and twenty years.’ 4The Nephilim were 
in the earth in those days, and also 
after that, when the sons of God came 
in unto the daughters of men, and they 
bore children to them; the same were 
the mighty men that were of old, the 
men of renown. 

5And the LORD saw that the 
wickedness of man was great in the 
earth, and that every imagination of 
the thoughts of his heart was only evil 
continually. 6And it repented the LORD 
that He had made man on the earth, 
and it grieved Him at His heart. 7And 
the LORD said: ‘I will blot out man 
whom I have created from the face of 
the earth; both man, and beast, and 
creeping thing, and fowl of the air; for 
it repenteth Me that I have made 
them.’ 8But Noah found grace in the 
eyes of the LORD. 


9These are the generations of Noah. 
Noah was in his generations a man 
righteous and wholehearted; Noah 
walked with God. 10And Noah begot 
three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
11And the earth was corrupt before 
God, and the earth was filled with 
violence. 12And God saw the earth, 
and, behold, it was corrupt; for all 
flesh had corrupted their way upon the 
earth. 
6 




13And God said unto Noah: ‘The 
end of all flesh is come before Me; for 
the earth is filled with violence 
through them; and, behold, I will 
destroy them with the earth. 14Make 
thee an ark of gopher wood; with 
rooms shalt thou make the ark, and 
shalt pitch it within and without with 
pitch. 15And this is how thou shalt 
make it: the length of the ark three 
hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty 
cubits, and the height of it thirty 
cubits. 16A light shalt thou make to the 
ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it 
upward; and the door of the ark shalt 
thou set in the side thereof; with lower, 
second, and third stories shalt thou 
make it. 17And I, behold, I do bring the 
flood of waters upon the earth, to 
destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath 
of life, from under heaven; every thing 
that is in the earth shall perish. 18But I 
will establish My covenant with thee; 
and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, 
and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy 
sons’wives with thee. 19And of every 
living thing of all flesh, two of every 
sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to 
keep them alive with thee; they shall 
be male and female. 20Of the fowl after 
their kind, and of the cattle after their 
kind, of every creeping thing of the 
ground after its kind, two of every sort 
shall come unto thee, to keep them 
alive. 21And take thou unto thee of all 
food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; 
and it shall be for food for thee, and 
for them.’ 22Thus did Noah; according 
to all that God commanded him, so did 
he. 

And the LORD said unto Noah: 
‘Come thou and all thy house into 
the ark; for thee have I seen righteous 
before Me in this generation. 2Of every 
clean beast thou shalt take to thee 
seven and seven, each with his mate; 
and of the beasts that are not clean two 
[and two], each with his mate; 3of the 
fowl also of the air, seven and seven, 
male and female; to keep seed alive 
upon the face of all the earth. 4For yet 
seven days, and I will cause it to rain 
upon the earth forty days and forty 
nights; and every living substance that 
I have made will I blot out from off the 
face of the earth.’ 5And Noah did 
according unto all that the LORD 
commanded him. 

6And Noah was six hundred years old 
when the flood of waters was upon the 
earth. 7And Noah went in, and his 
sons, and his wife, and his sons’wives 
with him, into the ark, because of the 
waters of the flood. 8Of clean beasts, 
and of beasts that are not clean, and of 
fowls, and of every thing that creepeth 
upon the ground, 9there went in two 
and two unto Noah into the ark, male 
and female, as God commanded Noah. 
10And it came to pass after the seven 
days, that the waters of the flood were 
upon the earth. 11In the six hundredth 
year of Noah’s life, in the second 
month, on the seventeenth day of the 
month, on the same day were all the 
fountains of the great deep broken up, 
and the windows of heaven were 
7 




opened. 12And the rain was upon the 
earth forty days and forty nights. 

13In the selfsame day entered Noah, 
and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the 
sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and 
the three wives of his sons with them, 
into the ark; 14they, and every beast 
after its kind, and all the cattle after 
their kind, and every creeping thing 
that creepeth upon the earth after its 
kind, and every fowl after its kind, 
every bird of every sort. 15And they 
went in unto Noah into the ark, two 
and two of all flesh wherein is the 
breath of life. 16And they that went in, 
went in male and female of all flesh, as 
God commanded him; and the LORD 
shut him in. 17And the flood was forty 
days upon the earth; and the waters 
increased, and bore up the ark, and it 
was lifted up above the earth. 18And 
the waters prevailed, and increased 
greatly upon the earth; and the ark 
went upon the face of the waters. 
19And the waters prevailed 
exceedingly upon the earth; and all the 
high mountains that were under the 
whole heaven were covered. 20Fifteen 
cubits upward did the waters prevail; 
and the mountains were covered. 
21And all flesh perished that moved 
upon the earth, both fowl, and cattle, 
and beast, and every swarming thing 
that swarmeth upon the earth, and 
every man; 22all in whose nostrils was 
the breath of the spirit of life, 
whatsoever was in the dry land, died. 
23And He blotted out every living 
substance which was upon the face of 
the ground, both man, and cattle, and 
creeping thing, and fowl of the heaven; 
and they were blotted out from the 
earth; and Noah only was left, and 
they that were with him in the ark. 
24And the waters prevailed upon the 
earth a hundred and fifty days. 

And God remembered Noah, and 
every living thing, and all the 
cattle that were with him in the ark; 
and God made a wind to pass over the 
earth, and the waters assuaged; 2the 
fountains also of the deep and the 
windows of heaven were stopped, and 
the rain from heaven was restrained. 
3And the waters returned from off the 
earth continually; and after the end of 
a hundred and fifty days the waters 
decreased. 4And the ark rested in the 
seventh month, on the seventeenth day 
of the month, upon the mountains of 
Ararat. 5And the waters decreased 
continually until the tenth month; in 
the tenth month, on the first day of the 
month, were the tops of the mountains 
seen. 

6And it came to pass at the end of 
forty days, that Noah opened the 
window of the ark which he had made. 
7And he sent forth a raven, and it went 
forth to and fro, until the waters were 
dried up from off the earth. 8And he 
sent forth a dove from him, to see if 
the waters were abated from off the 
face of the ground. 9But the dove 
found no rest for the sole of her foot, 
and she returned unto him to the ark, 
for the waters were on the face of the 
whole earth; and he put forth his hand, 
8 




and took her, and brought her in unto 
him into the ark. 10And he stayed yet 
other seven days; and again he sent 
forth the dove out of the ark. 11And the 
dove came in to him at eventide; and 
lo in her mouth an olive-leaf freshly 
plucked; so Noah knew that the waters 
were abated from off the earth. 12And 
he stayed yet other seven days; and 
sent forth the dove; and she returned 
not again unto him any more. 

13And it came to pass in the six 
hundred and first year, in the first 
month, the first day of the month, the 
waters were dried up from off the 
earth; and Noah removed the covering 
of the ark, and looked, and behold, the 
face of the ground was dried. 14And in 
the second month, on the seven and 
twentieth day of the month, was the 
earth dry. 

15And God spoke unto Noah, 
saying: 16’Go forth from the ark, thou, 
and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy 
sons’wives with thee. 17Bring forth 
with thee every living thing that is 
with thee of all flesh, both fowl, and 
cattle, and every creeping thing that 
creepeth upon the earth; that they may 
swarm in the earth, and be fruitful, and 
multiply upon the earth.’ 18And Noah 
went forth, and his sons, and his wife, 
and his sons’wives with him; 19every 
beast, every creeping thing, and every 
fowl, whatsoever moveth upon the 
earth, after their families; went forth 
out of the ark. 

20And Noah builded an altar unto 
the LORD; and took of every clean 
beast, and of every clean fowl, and 
offered burnt-offerings on the altar. 
21And the LORD smelled the sweet 
savour; and the LORD said in His heart: 
‘I will not again curse the ground any 
more for man’s sake; for the 
imagination of man’s heart is evil from 
his youth; neither will I again smite 
any more every thing living, as I have 
done. 22While the earth remaineth, 
seedtime and harvest, and cold and 
heat, and summer and winter, and day 
and night shall not cease.’ 

And God blessed Noah and his 
sons, and said unto them: ‘Be 
fruitful and multiply, and replenish the 
earth. 2And the fear of you and the 
dread of you shall be upon every beast 
of the earth, and upon every fowl of 
the air, and upon all wherewith the 
ground teemeth, and upon all the 
fishes of the sea: into your hand are 
they delivered. 3Every moving thing 
that liveth shall be for food for you; as 
the green herb have I given you all. 
4Only flesh with the life thereof, which 
is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 
5And surely your blood of your lives 
will I require; at the hand of every 
beast will I require it; and at the hand 
of man, even at the hand of every 
man’s brother, will I require the life of 
man. 6Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, 
by man shall his blood be shed; for in 
the image of God made He man. 7And 
you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; 
swarm in the earth, and multiply 
therein.’ 
9 




8And God spoke unto Noah, and to 
his sons with him, saying: 9’As for Me, 
behold, I establish My covenant with 
you, and with your seed after you; 
10and with every living creature that is 
with you, the fowl, the cattle, and 
every beast of the earth with you; of 
all that go out of the ark, even every 
beast of the earth. 11And I will 
establish My covenant with you; 
neither shall all flesh be cut off any 
more by the waters of the flood; 
neither shall there any more be a flood 
to destroy the earth.’ 12And God said: 
‘This is the token of the covenant 
which I make between Me and you 
and every living creature that is with 
you, for perpetual generations: 13I have 
set My bow in the cloud, and it shall 
be for a token of a covenant between 
Me and the earth. 14And it shall come 
to pass, when I bring clouds over the 
earth, and the bow is seen in the cloud, 
15that I will remember My covenant, 
which is between Me and you and 
every living creature of all flesh; and 
the waters shall no more become a 
flood to destroy all flesh. 16And the 
bow shall be in the cloud; and I will 
look upon it, that I may remember the 
everlasting covenant between God and 
every living creature of all flesh that is 
upon the earth.’ 17And God said unto 
Noah: ‘This is the token of the 
covenant which I have established 
between Me and all flesh that is upon 
the earth.’ 

18And the sons of Noah, that went 
forth from the ark, were Shem, and 
Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the 
father of Canaan. 19These three were 
the sons of Noah, and of these was the 
whole earth overspread. 

20And Noah the husbandman began, 
and planted a vineyard. 21And he drank 
of the wine, and was drunken; and he 
was uncovered within his tent. 22And 
Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the 
nakedness of his father, and told his 
two brethren without. 23And Shem and 
Japheth took a garment, and laid it 
upon both their shoulders, and went 
backward, and covered the nakedness 
of their father; and their faces were 
backward, and they saw not their 
father’s nakedness. 24And Noah awoke 
from his wine, and knew what his 
youngest son had done unto him. 
25And he said: 

Cursed be Canaan; a servant of 
servants shall he be unto his 
brethren. 

26And he said: 

Blessed be the LORD, the God of 
Shem; 

And let Canaan be their servant. 

27God aenlarge Japheth, and he shall 
dwell in the tents of Shem; 

a Heb. Japhth. 

And let Canaan be their servant. 

28And Noah lived after the flood 
three hundred and fifty years. 29And all 
the days of Noah were nine hundred 
and fifty years; and he died. 

 

10 



Now these are the generations 
of the sons of Noah: Shem, 


Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were 
sons born after the flood. 2The sons of 
Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and 
Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and 
Meshech, and Tiras. 3And the sons of 
Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and 
Togarmah. 4And the sons of Javan: 
Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and 
Dodanim. 5Of these were the isles of 
the nations divided in their lands, 
every one after his tongue, after their 
families, in their nations. 

6And the sons of Ham: Cush, and 
Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. 7And 
the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, 
and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; 
and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and 
Dedan. 8And Cush begot Nimrod; he 
began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
9He was a mighty hunter before the 
LORD; wherefore it is said: ‘Like 
Nimrod a mighty hunter before the 
LORD.’ 10And the beginning of his 
kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and 
Accad, and Calneh, in the land of 
Shinar. 11Out of that land went forth 
Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and 
Rehoboth-ir, and Calah, 12and Resen 
between Nineveh and Calah—the 
same is the great city. 13And Mizraim 
begot Ludim, and Anamim, and 
Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 14and 
Pathrusim, and Casluhim—whence 
went forth the Philistines—and 
Caphtorim. 

15And Canaan begot Zidon his 
firstborn, and Heth; 16and the Jebusite, 
and the Amorite, and the Girgashite; 
17and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and 
the Sinite; 18and the Arvadite, and the 
Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and 
afterward were the families of the 
Canaanite spread abroad. 19And the 
border of the Canaanite was from 
Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, 
unto Gaza; as thou goest toward 
Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and 
Zeboiim, unto Lasha. 20These are the 
sons of Ham, after their families, after 
their tongues, in their lands, in their 
nations. 

21And unto Shem, the father of all 
the children of Eber, the elder brother 
of Japheth, to him also were children 
born. 22The sons of Shem: Elam, and 
Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and 
Aram. 23And the sons of Aram: Uz, 
and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 24And 
Arpachshad begot Shelah; and Shelah 
begot Eber. 25And unto Eber were born 
two sons; the name of the one was 
aPeleg; for in his days was the earth 
divided; and his brother’s name was 
Joktan. 26And Joktan begot Almodad, 
and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and 
Jerah; 27and Hadoram, and Uzal, and 
Diklah; 28and Obal, and Abimael, and 
Sheba; 29and Ophir, and Havilah, and 
Jobab; all these were the sons of 
Joktan. 30And their dwelling was from 
Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, 
unto the mountain of the east. 31These 
are the sons of Shem, after their 
families, after their tongues, in their 
lands, after their nations. 

a That is, Division. 


32These are the families of the sons 
of Noah, after their generations, in 
their nations; and of these were the 
nations divided in the earth after the 
flood. 

And the whole earth was of 
one language and of one 
speech. 2And it came to pass, as they 
journeyed east, that they found a plain 
in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt 
there. 3And they said one to another: 
‘Come, let us make brick, and burn 
them thoroughly.’ And they had brick 
for stone, and slime had they for 
mortar. 4And they said: ‘Come, let us 
build us a city, and a tower, with its 
top in heaven, and let us make us a 
name; lest we be scattered abroad 
upon the face of the whole earth.’ 
5And the LORD came down to see the 
city and the tower, which the children 
of men builded. 6And the LORD said: 
‘Behold, they are one people, and they 
have all one language; and this is what 
they begin to do; and now nothing will 
be withholden from them, which they 
purpose to do. 7Come, let us go down, 
and there confound their language, that 
they may not understand one another’s 
speech.’ 8So the LORD scattered them 
abroad from thence upon the face of 
all the earth; and they left off to build 
the city. 9Therefore was the name of it 
called Babel; because the LORD did 
there aconfound the language of all the 
earth; and from thence did the LORD 

a Heb. Balal, to confound. 

scatter them abroad upon the face of 
all the earth. 

 

10These are the generations of Shem. 
Shem was a hundred years old, and 
begot Arpachshad two years after the 
flood. 11And Shem lived after he begot 
Arpachshad five hundred years, and 
begot sons and daughters. 

12And Arpachshad lived five and 
thirty years, and begot Shelah. 13And 
Arpachshad lived after he begot 
Shelah four hundred and three years, 
and begot sons and daughters. 

14And Shelah lived thirty years, and 
begot Eber. 15And Shelah lived after 
he begot Eber four hundred and three 
years, and begot sons and daughters. 

16And Eber lived four and thirty 
years, and begot Peleg. 17And Eber 
lived after he begot Peleg four hundred 
and thirty years, and begot sons and 
daughters. 

18And Peleg lived thirty years, and 
begot Reu. 19And Peleg lived after he 
begot Reu two hundred and nine years, 
and begot sons and daughters. 

20And Reu lived two and thirty 
years, and begot Serug. 21And Reu 
lived after he begot Serug two hundred 
and seven years, and begot sons and 
daughters. 

22And Serug lived thirty years, and 
begot Nahor. 23And Serug lived after 
he begot Nahor two hundred years, 
and begot sons and daughters. 

24And Nahor lived nine and twenty 
years, and begot Terah. 25And Nahor 
lived after he begot Terah a hundred 
11 




and nineteen years, and begot sons and 
daughters. 

26And Terah lived seventy years, 
and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 
27Now these are the generations of 
Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and 
Haran; and Haran begot Lot. 28And 
Haran died in the presence of his 
father Terah in the land of his nativity, 
in Ur of the Chaldees. 29And Abram 
and Nahor took them wives: the name 
of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the 
name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the 
daughter of Haran, the father of 
Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 30And 
Sarai was barren; she had no child. 
31And Terah took Abram his son, and 
Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, 
and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son 
Abram’s wife; and they went forth 
with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to 
go into the land of Canaan; and they 
came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 
32And the days of Terah were two 
hundred and five years; and Terah died 
in Haran. 


Now the LORD said unto 
Abram: ‘Get thee out of thy 
country, and from thy kindred, and 
from thy father’s house, unto the land 
that I will show thee. 2And I will make 
of thee a great nation, and I will bless 
thee, and make thy name great; and be 
thou a blessing. 3And I will bless them 
that bless thee, and him that curseth 
thee will I curse; and in thee shall all 
the families of the earth be blessed.’ 
4So Abram went, as the LORD had 
spoken unto him; and Lot went with 
him; and Abram was seventy and five 
years old when he departed out of 
Haran. 5And Abram took Sarai his 
wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all 
their substance that they had gathered, 
and the souls that they had gotten in 
Haran; and they went forth to go into 
the land of Canaan; and into the land 
of Canaan they came. 6And Abram 
passed through the land unto the place 
of Shechem, unto the terebinth of 
Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in 
the land. 7And the LORD appeared unto 
Abram, and said: ‘Unto thy seed will I 
give this land’; and he builded there an 
altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto 
him. 8And he removed from thence 
unto the mountain on the east of Beth-
el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el 
on the west, and Ai on the east; and he 
builded there an altar unto the LORD, 
and called upon the name of the LORD. 
9And Abram journeyed, going on still 
toward the South. 

10And there was a famine in the 
land; and Abram went down into 
Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine 
was sore in the land. 11And it came to 
pass, when he was come near to enter 
into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his 
wife: ‘Behold now, I know that thou 
art a fair woman to look upon. 12And it 
will come to pass, when the Egyptians 
shall see thee, that they will say: This 
is his wife; and they will kill me, but 
thee they will keep alive. 13Say, I pray 
thee, thou art my sister; that it may be 
well with me for thy sake, and that my 
12 




soul may live because of thee.’ 14And 
it came to pass, that, when Abram was 
come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld 
the woman that she was very fair. 
15And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, 
and praised her to Pharaoh; and the 
woman was taken into Pharaoh’s 
house. 16And he dealt well with Abram 
for her sake; and he had sheep, and 
oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, 
and maid-servants, and she-asses, and 
camels. 17And the LORD plagued 
Pharaoh and his house with great 
plagues because of Sarai Abram’s 
wife. 18And Pharaoh called Abram, 
and said: ‘What is this that thou hast 
done unto me? why didst thou not tell 
me that she was thy wife? 19Why 
saidst thou: She is my sister? so that I 
took her to be my wife; now therefore 
behold thy wife, take her, and go thy 
way.’ 20And Pharaoh gave men charge 
concerning him; and they brought him 
on the way, and his wife, and all that 
he had. 

And Abram went up out of 
Egypt, he, and his wife, and all 
that he had, and Lot with him, into the 
South. 2And Abram was very rich in 
cattle, in silver, and in gold. 3And he 
went on his journeys from the South 
even to Beth-el, unto the place where 
his tent had been at the beginning, 
between Beth-el and Ai; 4unto the 
place of the altar, which he had made 
there at the first; and Abram called 
there on the name of the LORD. 5And 
Lot also, who went with Abram, had 
flocks, and herds, and tents. 6And the 
land was not able to bear them, that 
they might dwell together; for their 
substance was great, so that they could 
not dwell together. 7And there was a 
strife between the herdmen of Abram’s 
cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle. 
And the Canaanite and the Perizzite 
dwelt then in the land. 8And Abram 
said unto Lot: ‘Let there be no strife, I 
pray thee, between me and thee, and 
between my herdmen and thy 
herdmen; for we are brethren. 9Is not 
the whole land before thee? separate 
thyself, I pray thee, from me; if thou 
wilt take the left hand, then I will go to 
the right; or if thou take the right hand, 
then I will go to the left.’ 10And Lot 
lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the 
plain of the Jordan, that it was well 
watered every where, before the LORD 
destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like 
the garden of the LORD, like the land of 
Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar. 11So 
Lot chose him all the plain of the 
Jordan; and Lot journeyed east; and 
they separated themselves the one 
from the other. 12Abram dwelt in the 
land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the 
cities of the Plain, and moved his tent 
as far as Sodom. 13Now the men of 
Sodom were wicked and sinners 
against the LORD exceedingly. 14And 
the LORD said unto Abram, after that 
Lot was separated from him: ‘Lift up 
now thine eyes, and look from the 
place where thou art, northward and 
southward and eastward and 
westward; 15for all the land which thou 
seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy 
13 




seed for ever. 16And I will make thy 
seed as the dust of the earth; so that if 
a man can number the dust of the 
earth, then shall thy seed also be 
numbered. 17Arise, walk through the 
land in the length of it and in the 
breadth of it; for unto thee will I give 
it.’ 18And Abram moved his tent, and 
came and dwelt by the terebinths of 
Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built 
there an altar unto the LORD. 

And it came to pass in the 
days of Amraphel king of 
Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, 
Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal 
king of Goiim, 2that they made war 
with Bera king of Sodom, and with 
Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king 
of Admah, and Shemeber king of 
Zeboiim, and the king of Bela—the 
same is Zoar. 3All these came as allies 
unto the vale of Siddim—the same is 
the Salt Sea. 4Twelve years they 
served Chedorlaomer, and in the 
thirteenth year they rebelled. 5And in 
the fourteenth year came 
Chedorlaomer and the kings that were 
with him, and smote the Rephaim in 
Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in 
Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-
kiriathaim, 6and the Horites in their 
mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by 
the wilderness. 7And they turned back, 
and came to En-mishpat—the same is 
Kadesh—and smote all the country of 
the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, 
that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. 8And 
there went out the king of Sodom, and 
the king of Gomorrah, and the king of 
Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and 
the king of Bela—the same is Zoar; 
and they set the battle in array against 
them in the vale of Siddim; 9against 
Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal 
king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of 
Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; 
four kings against the five. 10Now the 
vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; 
and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah 
fled, and they fell there, and they that 
remained fled to the mountain. 11And 
they took all the goods of Sodom and 
Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and 
went their way. 12And they took Lot, 
Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in 
Sodom, and his goods, and departed. 
13And there came one that had 
escaped, and told Abram the 
Hebrew—now he dwelt by the 
terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, 
brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; 
and these were confederate with 
Abram. 14And when Abram heard that 
his brother was taken captive, he led 
forth his trained men, born in his 
house, three hundred and eighteen, and 
pursued as far as Dan. 15And he 
divided himself against them by night, 
he and his servants, and smote them, 
and pursued them unto Hobah, which 
is on the left hand of Damascus. 16And 
he brought back all the goods, and also 
brought back his brother Lot, and his 
goods, and the women also, and the 
people. 17And the king of Sodom went 
out to meet him, after his return from 
the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the 
kings that were with him, at the vale of 
14 




Shaveh—the same is the King’s Vale. 
18And Melchizedek king of Salem 
brought forth bread and wine; and he 
was priest of God the Most High. 
19And he blessed him, and said: 
‘Blessed be Abram of God Most High, 
Maker of heaven and earth; 20and 
blessed be God the Most High, who 
hath delivered thine enemies into thy 
hand.’ And he gave him a tenth of all. 
21And the king of Sodom said unto 
Abram: ‘Give me the persons, and take 
the goods to thyself.’ 22And Abram 
said to the king of Sodom: ‘I have 
lifted up my hand unto the LORD, God 
Most High, Maker of heaven and 
earth, 23that I will not take a thread nor 
a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, 
lest thou shouldest say: I have made 
Abram rich; 24save only that which the 
young men have eaten, and the portion 
of the men which went with me, Aner, 
Eshcol, and Mamre, let them take their 
portion.’ 

After these things the word of 
the LORD came unto Abram in 
a vision, saying: ‘Fear not, Abram, I 
am thy shield, thy reward shall be 
exceeding great.’ 2And Abram said: ‘O 
Lord GOD, what wilt Thou give me, 
seeing I go hence childless, and he that 
shall be possessor of my house is 
Eliezer of Damascus?’ 3And Abram 
said: ‘Behold, to me Thou hast given 
no seed, and, lo, one born in my house 
is to be mine heir.’ 4And, behold, the 
word of the LORD came unto him, 
saying: ‘This man shall not be thine 
heir; but he that shall come forth out of 
thine own bowels shall be thine heir.’ 
5And He brought him forth abroad, 
and said: ‘Look now toward heaven, 
and count the stars, if thou be able to 
count them’; and He said unto him: 
‘So shall thy seed be.’ 6And he 
believed in the LORD; and He counted 
it to him for righteousness. 7And He 
said unto him: ‘I am the LORD that 
brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, 
to give thee this land to inherit it.’ 
8And he said: ‘O Lord GOD, whereby 
shall I know that I shall inherit it?’ 
9And He said unto him: ‘Take Me a 
heifer of three years old, and a she-
goat of three years old, and a ram of 
three years old, and a turtle-dove, and 
a young pigeon.’ 10And he took him all 
these, and divided them in the midst, 
and laid each half over against the 
other; but the birds divided he not. 
11And the birds of prey came down 
upon the carcasses, and Abram drove 
them away. 12And it came to pass, that, 
when the sun was going down, a deep 
sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a 
dread, even a great darkness, fell upon 
him. 13And He said unto Abram: 
‘Know of a surety that thy seed shall 
be a stranger in a land that is not 
theirs, and shall serve them; and they 
shall afflict them four hundred years; 
14and also that nation, whom they shall 
serve, will I judge; and afterward shall 
they come out with great substance. 
15But thou shalt go to thy fathers in 
peace; thou shalt be buried in a good 
old age. 16And in the fourth generation 
they shall come back hither; for the 
15 




iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.’ 
17And it came to pass, that, when the 
sun went down, and there was thick 
darkness, behold a smoking furnace, 
and a flaming torch that passed 
between these pieces. 18In that day the 
LORD made a covenant with Abram, 
saying: ‘Unto thy seed have I given 
this land, from the river of Egypt unto 
the great river, the river Euphrates; 
19the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the 
Kadmonite, 20and the Hittite, and the 
Perizzite, and the Rephaim, 21and the 
Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the 
Girgashite, and the Jebusite.’ 

16 



Now Sarai Abram’s wife bore 
him no children; and she had a 
handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name 
was Hagar. 2And Sarai said unto 
Abram: ‘Behold now, the LORD hath 
restrained me from bearing; go in, I 
pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may 
be that I shall be builded up through 
her.’ And Abram hearkened to the 
voice of Sarai. 3And Sarai Abram’s 
wife took Hagar the Egyptian, her 
handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten 
years in the land of Canaan, and gave 
her to Abram her husband to be his 
wife. 4And he went in unto Hagar, and 
she conceived; and when she saw that 
she had conceived, her mistress was 
despised in her eyes. 5And Sarai said 
unto Abram: ‘My wrong be upon thee: 
I gave my handmaid into thy bosom; 
and when she saw that she had 
conceived, I was despised in her eyes: 
the LORD judge between me and thee.’ 
6But Abram said unto Sarai: ‘Behold, 
thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that 
which is good in thine eyes.’ And 
Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she 
fled from her face. 7And the angel of 
the LORD found her by a fountain of 
water in the wilderness, by the 
fountain in the way to Shur. 8And he 
said: ‘Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid, 
whence camest thou? and whither 
goest thou?’ And she said: ‘I flee from 
the face of my mistress Sarai.’ 9And 
the angel of the LORD said unto her: 
‘Return to thy mistress, and submit 
thyself under her hands.’ 10And the 
angel of the LORD said unto her: ‘I will 
greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall 
not be numbered for multitude. 11And 
the angel of the LORD said unto her: 
‘Behold, thou art with child, and shalt 
bear a son; and thou shalt call his 
name aIshmael, because the LORD hath 
heard thy affliction. 12And he shall be 
a wild ass of a man: his hand shall be 
against every man, and every man’s 
hand against him; and he shall dwell in 
the face of all his brethren.’ 13And she 
called the name of the LORD that spoke 
unto her, Thou art ba God of seeing; 
for she said: ‘Have I even here seen 
Him that seeth Me?’ 14Wherefore the 
well was called cBeer-lahai-roi; 
behold, it is between Kadesh and 
Bered. 15And Hagar bore Abram a son; 
and Abram called the name of his son, 

a That is, God heareth. 

b Heb. El roi. 

c That is, The well of the Living One 
who seeth me. 


whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 16And 
Abram was fourscore and six years 
old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to 
Abram. 

17 



And when Abram was ninety 
years old and nine, the LORD 
appeared to Abram, and said unto him: 
‘I am God Almighty; walk before Me, 
and be thou wholehearted. 2And I will 
make My covenant between Me and 
thee, and will multiply thee 
exceedingly.’ 3And Abram fell on his 
face; and God talked with him, saying: 
4’As for Me, behold, My covenant is 
with thee, and thou shalt be athe father 
of a multitude of nations. 5Neither 
shall thy name any more be called 
Abram, but thy name shall be 
Abraham; for the father of a multitude 
of nations have I made thee. 6And I 
will make thee exceeding fruitful, and 
I will make nations of thee, and kings 
shall come out of thee. 7And I will 
establish My covenant between Me 
and thee and thy seed after thee 
throughout their generations for an 
everlasting covenant, to be a God unto 
thee and to thy seed after thee. 8And I 
will give unto thee, and to thy seed 
after thee, the land of thy sojournings, 
all the land of Canaan, for an 
everlasting possession; and I will be 
their God.’ 9And God said unto 
Abraham: ‘And as for thee, thou shalt 
keep My covenant, thou, and thy seed 
after thee throughout their generations. 
10This is My covenant, which ye shall 

a Heb. Ab hamon. 

keep, between Me and you and thy 
seed after thee: every male among you 
shall be circumcised. 11And ye shall be 
circumcised in the flesh of your 
foreskin; and it shall be a token of a 
covenant betwixt Me and you. 12And 
he that is eight days old shall be 
circumcised among you, every male 
throughout your generations, he that is 
born in the house, or bought with 
money of any foreigner, that is not of 
thy seed. 13He that is born in thy 
house, and he that is bought with thy 
money, must needs be circumcised; 
and My covenant shall be in your flesh 
for an everlasting covenant. 14And the 
uncircumcised male who is not 
circumcised in the flesh of his 
foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from 
his people; he hath broken My 
covenant.’ 

15And God said unto Abraham: ‘As 
for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call 
her name Sarai, but bSarah shall her 
name be. 16And I will bless her, and 
moreover I will give thee a son of her; 
yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a 
mother of nations; kings of peoples 
shall be of her.’ 17Then Abraham fell 
upon his face, and laughed, and said in 
his heart: ‘Shall a child be born unto 
him that is a hundred years old? and 
shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, 
bear?’ 18And Abraham said unto God: 
‘Oh that Ishmael might live before 
Thee! ’ 19And God said: ‘‘Nay, but 
Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; 

b That is, Princess. 


and thou shalt call his name aIsaac; and 
I will establish My covenant with him 
for an everlasting covenant for his 
seed after him. 20And as for Ishmael, I 
have heard thee; behold, I have blessed 
him, and will make him fruitful, and 
will multiply him exceedingly; twelve 
princes shall he beget, and I will make 
him a great nation. 21But My covenant 
will I establish with Isaac, whom 
Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set 
time in the next year.’ 22And He left 
off talking with him, and God went up 
from Abraham. 23And Abraham took 
Ishmael his son, and all that were born 
in his house, and all that were bought 
with his money, every male among the 
men of Abraham’s house, and 
circumcised the flesh of their foreskin 
in the selfsame day, as God had said 
unto him. 24And Abraham was ninety 
years old and nine, when he was 
circumcised in the flesh of his 
foreskin. 25And Ishmael his son was 
thirteen years old, when he was 
circumcised in the flesh of his 
foreskin. 26In the selfsame day was 
Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his 
son. 27And all the men of his house, 
those born in the house, and those 
bought with money of a foreigner, 
were circumcised with him.

laugh. 

 


And the LORD appeared unto 
him by the terebinths of 

Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the 
heat of the day; 2and he lifted up his 
eyes and looked, and, lo, three men 
stood over against him; and when he 
saw them, he ran to meet them from 
the tent door, and bowed down to the 
earth, 3and said: ‘My lord, if now I 
have found favour in thy sight, pass 
not away, I pray thee, from thy 
servant. 4Let now a little water be 
fetched, and wash your feet, and 
recline yourselves under the tree. 5And 
I will fetch a morsel of bread, and stay 
ye your heart; after that ye shall pass 
on; forasmuch as ye are come to your 
servant.’ And they said: ‘So do, as 
thou hast said.’ 6And Abraham 
hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and 
said: ‘Make ready quickly three 
measures of fine meal, knead it, and 
make cakes.’ 7And Abraham ran unto 
the herd, and fetched a calf tender and 
good, and gave it unto the servant; and 
he hastened to dress it. 8And he took 
curd, and milk, and the calf which he 
had dressed, and set it before them; 
and he stood by them under the tree, 
and they did eat. 9And they said unto 
him: ‘Where is Sarah thy wife?’ And 
he said: ‘Behold, in the tent.’ 10And He 
said: ‘I will certainly return unto thee 
when the season cometh round; and, 
lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.’ 
And Sarah heard in the tent door, 
which was behind him.—11Now 
Abraham and Sarah were old, and well 
stricken in age; it had ceased to be 
with Sarah after the manner of 
women.—12And Sarah laughed within 
18 




herself, saying: ‘After I am waxed old 
shall I have pleasure, my lord being 
old also?’ 13And the LORD said unto 
Abraham: ‘Wherefore did Sarah laugh, 
saying: Shall I of a surety bear a child, 
who am old? 14Is any thing too hard 
for the LORD. At the set time I will 
return unto thee, when the season 
cometh round, and Sarah shall have a 
son.’ 15Then Sarah denied, saying: ‘I 
laughed not’; for she was afraid. And 
He said: ‘Nay; but thou didst laugh.’ 

16And the men rose up from thence, 
and looked out toward Sodom; and 
Abraham went with them to bring 
them on the way. 17And the LORD said: 
‘Shall I hide from Abraham that which 
I am doing; 18seeing that Abraham 
shall surely become a great and mighty 
nation, and all the nations of the earth 
shall be blessed in him? 19For I have 
known him, to the end that he may 
command his children and his 
household after him, that they may 
keep the way of the LORD, to do 
righteousness and justice; to the end 
that the LORD may bring upon 
Abraham that which He hath spoken 
of him.’ 20And the LORD said: ‘Verily, 
the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is 
great, and, verily, their sin is 
exceeding grievous. 21I will go down 
now, and see whether they have done 
altogether according to the cry of it, 
which is come unto Me; and if not, I 
will know.’ 22And the men turned from 
thence, and went toward Sodom; but 
Abraham stood yet before the LORD. 
23And Abraham drew near, and said: 
‘Wilt Thou indeed sweep away the 
righteous with the wicked? 
24Peradventure there are fifty righteous 
within the city; wilt Thou indeed 
sweep away and not forgive the place 
for the fifty righteous that are therein? 
25That be far from Thee to do after this 
manner, to slay the righteous with the 
wicked, that so the righteous should be 
as the wicked; that be far from Thee; 
shall not the judge of all the earth do 
justly?’ 26And the LORD said: ‘If I find 
in Sodom fifty righteous within the 
city, then I will forgive all the place 
for their sake.’ 27And Abraham 
answered and said: ‘Behold now, I 
have taken upon me to speak unto the 
Lord, who am but dust and ashes. 
28Peradventure there shall lack five of 
the fifty righteous; wilt Thou destroy 
all the city for lack of five?’ And He 
said: ‘I will not destroy it, if I find 
there forty and five.’ 29And he spoke 
unto Him yet again, and said: 
‘Peradventure there shall be forty 
found there.’ And He said: ‘I will not 
do it for the forty’s sake.’ 30And he 
said: ‘Oh, let not the Lord be angry, 
and I will speak. Peradventure there 
shall thirty be found there.’ And He 
said: ‘I will not do it, if I find thirty 
there.’ 31And he said: ‘Behold now, I 
have taken upon me to speak unto the 
Lord. Peradventure there shall be 
twenty found there.’ And He said: ‘I 
will not destroy it for the twenty’s 
sake.’ 32And he said: ‘Oh, let not the 
Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but 
this once. Peradventure ten shall be 


found there.’ And He said: ‘I will not 
destroy it for the ten’s sake.’ 33And the 
LORD went His way, as soon as He had 
left off speaking to Abraham; and 
Abraham returned unto his place. 

And the two angels came to 
Sodom at even; and Lot sat in 
the gate of Sodom; and Lot saw them, 
and rose up to meet them; and he fell 
down on his face to the earth; 2and he 
said: ‘Behold now, my lords, turn 
aside, I pray you, into your servant’s 
house, and tarry all night, and wash 
your feet, and ye shall rise up early, 
and go on your way.’ And they said: 
‘Nay; but we will abide in the broad 
place all night.’ 3And he urged them 
greatly; and they turned in unto him, 
and entered into his house; and he 
made them a feast, and did bake 
unleavened bread, and they did eat. 
4But before they lay down, the men of 
the city, even the men of Sodom, 
compassed the house round, both 
young and old, all the people from 
every quarter. 5And they called unto 
Lot, and said unto him: ‘Where are the 
men that came in to thee this night? 
bring them out unto us, that we may 
know them.’ 6And Lot went out unto 
them to the door, and shut the door 
after him. 7And he said: ‘I pray you, 
my brethren, do not so wickedly. 
8Behold now, I have two daughters 
that have not known man; let me, I 
pray you, bring them out unto you, and 
do ye to them as is good in your eyes; 
only unto these men do nothing; 
forasmuch as they are come under the 
shadow of my roof.’ 9And they said: 
‘Stand back.’ And they said: ‘This one 
fellow came in to sojourn, and he will 
needs play the judge; now will we deal 
worse with thee, than with them.’ And 
they pressed sore upon the man, even 
Lot, and drew near to break the door. 
10But the men put forth their hand, and 
brought Lot into the house to them, 
and the door they shut. 11And they 
smote the men that were at the door of 
the house with blindness, both small 
and great; so that they wearied 
themselves to find the door. 12And the 
men said unto Lot: ‘Hast thou here any 
besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and 
thy daughters, and whomsoever thou 
hast in the city; bring them out of the 
place; 13for we will destroy this place, 
because the cry of them is waxed great 
before the LORD; and the LORD hath 
sent us to destroy it.’ 14And Lot went 
out, and spoke unto his sons-in-law, 
who married his daughters, and said: 
‘Up, get you out of this place; for the 
LORD will destroy the city.’ But he 
seemed unto his sons-in-law as one 
that jested. 15And when the morning 
arose, then the angels hastened Lot, 
saying: ‘Arise, take thy wife, and thy 
two daughters that are here; lest thou 
be swept away in the iniquity of the 
city.’ 16But he lingered; and the men 
laid hold upon his hand, and upon the 
hand of his wife, and upon the hand of 
his two daughters; the LORD being 
merciful unto him. And they brought 
him forth, and set him without the city. 
17And it came to pass, when they had 
19 




brought them forth abroad, that he 
said: ‘Escape for thy life; look not 
behind thee, neither stay thou in all the 
Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou 
be swept away.’ 18And Lot said unto 
them: ‘Oh, not so, my lord; 19behold 
now, thy servant hath found grace in 
thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy 
mercy, which thou hast shown unto me 
in saving my life; and I cannot escape 
to the mountain, lest the evil overtake 
me, and I die. 20Behold now, this city 
is near to flee unto, and it is a little 
one; oh, let me escape thither—is it 
not a little one?—and my soul shall 
live.’ 21And he said unto him: ‘See, I 
have accepted thee concerning this 
thing also, that I will not overthrow the 
city of which thou hast spoken. 
22Hasten thou, escape thither; for I 
cannot do any thing till thou be come 
thither.’—Therefore the name of the 
city was called aZoar.— 23The sun was 
risen upon the earth when Lot came 
unto Zoar. 24Then the LORD caused to 
rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah 
brimstone and fire from the LORD out 
of heaven; 25and He overthrow those 
cities, and all the Plain, and all the 
inhabitants of the cities, and that which 
grew upon the ground. 26But his wife 
looked back from behind him, and she 
became a pillar of salt. 27And Abraham 
got up early in the morning to the 
place where he had stood before the 
LORD. 28And he looked out toward 
Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all 

a That is, Little, see verse 20. 

the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, 
lo, the smoke of the land went up as 
the smoke of a furnace. 

29And it came to pass, when God 
destroyed the cities of the Plain, that 
God remembered Abraham, and sent 
Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, 
when He overthrew the cities in which 
Lot dwelt. 

30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and 
dwelt in the mountain, and his two 
daughters with him; for he feared to 
dwell in Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, 
he and his two daughters. 31And the 
first-born said unto the younger: ‘Our 
father is old, and there is not a man in 
the earth to come in unto us after the 
manner of all the earth. 32Come, let us 
make our father drink wine, and we 
will lie with him, that we may preserve 
seed of our father.’ 33And they made 
their father drink wine that night. And 
the first-born went in, and lay with her 
father; and he knew not when she lay 
down, nor when she arose. 34And it 
came to pass on the morrow, that the 
first-born said unto the younger: 
‘Behold, I lay yesternight with my 
father. Let us make him drink wine 
this night also; and go thou in, and lie 
with him, that we may preserve seed 
of our father.’ 35And they made their 
father drink wine that night also. And 
the younger arose, and lay with him; 
and he knew not when she lay down, 
nor when she arose. 36Thus were both 
the daughters of Lot with child by their 
father. 37And the first-born bore a son, 
and called his name Moab—the same 


is the father of the Moabites unto this 
day. 38And the younger, she also bore 
a son, and called his name Ben-
ammi—the same is the father of the 
children of Ammon unto this day. 

And Abraham journeyed from 
thence toward the land of the 
South, and dwelt between Kadesh and 
Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. 2And 
Abraham said of Sarah his wife: ‘She 
is my sister.’ And Abimelech king of 
Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 3But God 
came to Abimelech in a dream of the 
night, and said to him: ‘Behold, thou 
shalt die, because of the woman whom 
thou hast taken; for she is a man’s 
wife.’ 4Now Abimelech had not come 
near her; and he said: ‘Lord, wilt Thou 
slay even a righteous nation? 5Said he 
not himself unto me: She is my sister? 
and she, even she herself said: He is 
my brother. In the simplicity of my 
heart and the innocency of my hands 
have I done this.’ 6And God said unto 
him in the dream: ‘Yea, I know that in 
the simplicity of thy heart thou hast 
done this, and I also withheld thee 
from sinning against Me. Therefore 
suffered I thee not to touch her. 7Now 
therefore restore the man’s wife; for he 
is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, 
and thou shalt live; and if thou restore 
her not, know thou that thou shalt 
surely die, thou, and all that are thine.’ 
8And Abimelech rose early in the 
morning, and called all his servants, 
and told all these things in their ears; 
and the men were sore afraid. 9Then 
Abimelech called Abraham, and said 
unto him: ‘What hast thou done unto 
us? and wherein have I sinned against 
thee, that thou hast brought on me and 
on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast 
done deeds unto me that ought not to 
be done.’ 10And Abimelech said unto 
Abraham: ‘What sawest thou, that 
thou hast done this thing?’ 11And 
Abraham said: ‘Because I thought: 
Surely the fear of God is not in this 
place; and they will slay me for my 
wife’s sake. 12And moreover she is 
indeed my sister, the daughter of my 
father, but not the daughter of my 
mother; and so she became my wife. 
13And it came to pass, when God 
caused me to wander from my father’s 
house, that I said unto her: This is thy 
kindness which thou shalt show unto 
me; at every place whither we shall 
come, say of me: He is my brother.’ 
14And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, 
and men-servants and women-
servants, and gave them unto 
Abraham, and restored him Sarah his 
wife. 15And Abimelech said: ‘Behold, 
my land is before thee: dwell where it 
pleaseth thee.’ 16And unto Sarah he 
said: ‘Behold, I have given thy brother 
a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it 
is for thee a covering of the eyes to all 
that are with thee; and before all men 
thou art righted.’ 17And Abraham 
prayed unto God; and God healed 
Abimelech, and his wife, and his 
maid-servants; and they bore children. 
18For the LORD had fast closed up all 
the wombs of the house of Abimelech, 
because of Sarah Abraham’s wife. 
20 






And the LORD remembered 
Sarah as He had said, and the 
LORD did unto Sarah as He had spoken. 
2And Sarah conceived, and bore 
Abraham a son in his old age, at the 
set time of which God had spoken to 
him. 3And Abraham called the name of 
his son that was born unto him, whom 
Sarah bore to him, Isaac. 4And 
Abraham circumcised his son Isaac 
when he was eight days old, as God 
had commanded him. 5And Abraham 
was a hundred years old, when his son 
Isaac was born unto him. 6And Sarah 
said: ‘God hath made laughter for me; 
every one that heareth will laugh on 
account of me.’ 7And she said: ‘Who 
would have said unto Abraham, that 
Sarah should give children suck? for I 
have borne him a son in his old age.’ 

8And the child grew, and was 
weaned. And Abraham made a great 
feast on the day that Isaac was 
weaned. 9And Sarah saw the son of 
Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had 
borne unto Abraham, making sport. 
10Wherefore she said unto Abraham: 
‘Cast out this bondwoman and her son; 
for the son of this bondwoman shall 
not be heir with my son, even with 
Isaac.’ 11And the thing was very 
grievous in Abraham’s sight on 
account of his son. 12And God said 
unto Abraham: ‘Let it not be grievous 
in thy sight because of the lad, and 
because of thy bondwoman; in all that 
Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her 
voice; for in Isaac shall seed be called 
to thee. 13And also of the son of the 
bondwoman will I make a nation, 
because he is thy seed.’ 14And 
Abraham arose up early in the 
morning, and took bread and a bottle 
of water, and gave it unto Hagar, 
putting it on her shoulder, and the 
child, and sent her away; and she 
departed, and strayed in the wilderness 
of Beer-sheba. 15And the water in the 
bottle was spent, and she cast the child 
under one of the shrubs. 16And she 
went, and sat her down over against 
him a good way off, as it were a bow-
shot; for she said: ‘Let me not look 
upon the death of the child.’ And she 
sat over against him, and lifted up her 
voice, and wept. 17And God heard the 
voice of the lad; and the angel of God 
called to Hagar out of heaven, and said 
unto her: ‘What aileth thee, Hagar? 
fear not; for God hath heard the voice 
of the lad where he is. 18Arise, lift up 
the lad, and hold him fast by thy hand; 
for I will make him a great nation.’ 
19And God opened her eyes, and she 
saw a well of water; and she went, and 
filled the bottle with water, and gave 
the lad drink. 20And God was with the 
lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the 
wilderness, and became an archer. 
21And he dwelt in the wilderness of 
Paran; and his mother took him a wife 
out of the land of Egypt. 

22And it came to pass at that time, 
that Abimelech and Phicol the captain 
of his host spoke unto Abraham, 
saying: ‘God is with thee in all that 
thou doest. 23Now therefore swear unto 
me here by God that thou wilt not deal 
21 




falsely with me, nor with my son, nor 
with my son’s son; but according to 
the kindness that I have done unto 
thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the 
land wherein thou hast sojourned.’ 
24And Abraham said: ‘I will swear.’ 
25And Abraham reproved Abimelech 
because of the well of water, which 
Abimelech’s servants had violently 
taken away. 26And Abimelech said: ‘I 
know not who hath done this thing; 
neither didst thou tell me, neither yet 
heard I of it, but to-day.’ 27And 
Abraham took sheep and oxen, and 
gave them unto Abimelech; and they 
two made a covenant. 28And Abraham 
set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by 
themselves. 29And Abimelech said 
unto Abraham: ‘What mean these 
seven ewe-lambs which thou hast set 
by themselves?’ 30And he said: 
‘Verily, these seven ewe-lambs shalt 
thou take of my hand, that it may be a 
witness unto me, that I have digged 
this well.’ 31Wherefore that place was 
called Beer-sheba; because there they 
swore both of them. 32So they made a 
covenant at Beer-sheba; and 
Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the 
captain of his host, and they returned 
into the land of the Philistines. 33And 
Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in 
Beer-sheba, and called there on the 
name of the LORD, the Everlasting 
God. 34And Abraham sojourned in the 
land of the Philistines many days. 

22 



And it came to pass after these 
things, that God did prove 
Abraham, and said unto him: 
‘Abraham’; and he said: ‘Here am I.’ 
2And He said: ‘Take now thy son, 
thine only son, whom thou lovest, 
even Isaac, and get thee into the land 
of Moriah; and offer him there for a 
burnt-offering upon one of the 
mountains which I will tell thee of.’ 
3And Abraham rose early in the 
morning, and saddled his ass, and took 
two of his young men with him, and 
Isaac his son; and he cleaved the wood 
for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and 
went unto the place of which God had 
told him. 4On the third day Abraham 
lifted up his eyes, and saw the place 
afar off. 5And Abraham said unto his 
young men: ‘Abide ye here with the 
ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; 
and we will worship, and come back to 
you.’ 6And Abraham took the wood of 
the burnt-offering, and laid it upon 
Isaac his son; and he took in his hand 
the fire and the knife; and they went 
both of them together. 7And Isaac 
spoke unto Abraham his father, and 
said: ‘My father.’ And he said: ‘Here 
am I, my son.’ And he said: ‘Behold 
the fire and the wood; but where is the 
lamb for a burnt-offering?’ 8And 
Abraham said: ‘God will aprovide 
Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, 
my son.’ So they went both of them 
together. 9And they came to the place 
which God had told him of; and 
Abraham built the altar there, and laid 
the wood in order, and bound Isaac his 
son, and laid him on the altar, upon the 

a Heb jireh, that is, see for Himself. 


wood. 10And Abraham stretched forth 
his hand, and took the knife to slay his 
son. 11And the angel of the LORD called 
unto him out of heaven, and said: 
‘Abraham, Abraham.’ And he said: 
‘Here am I.’ 12And he said: ‘Lay not 
thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou 
any thing unto him; for now I know 
that thou art a God-fearing man, seeing 
thou hast not withheld thy son, thine 
only son, from Me.’ 13And Abraham 
lifted up his eyes, and looked, and 
behold behind him a ram caught in the 
thicket by his horns. And Abraham 
went and took the ram, and offered 
him up for a burnt-offering in the stead 
of his son. 14And Abraham called the 
name of that place aAdonai-jireh; as it 
is said to this day: ‘In the mount where 
the LORD is seen.’ 15And the angel of 
the LORD called unto Abraham a 
second time out of heaven, 16and said: 
‘By Myself have I sworn, saith the 
LORD, because thou hast done this 
thing, and hast not withheld thy son, 
thine only son, 17that in blessing I will 
bless thee, and in multiplying I will 
multiply thy seed as the stars of the 
heaven, and as the sand which is upon 
the seashore; and thy seed shall 
possess the gate of his enemies; 18and 
in thy seed shall all the nations of the 
earth be blessed; because thou hast 
hearkened to My voice.’ 19So Abraham 
returned unto his young men, and they 
rose up and went together to Beer-

a That is, The LORD seeth. 

sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-
sheba. 

20And it came to pass after these 
things, that it was told Abraham, 
saying: ‘Behold, Milcah, she also hath 
borne children unto thy brother Nahor: 
21Uz his first-born, and Buz his 
brother, and Kemuel the father of 
Aram; 22and Chesed, and Hazo, and 
Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.’ 
23And Bethuel begot Rebekah; these 
eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, 
Abraham’s brother. 24And his 
concubine, whose name was Reumah, 
she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and 
Tahash, and Maacah. 


And the life of Sarah was a 
hundred and seven and twenty 
years; these were the years of the life 
of Sarah. 2And Sarah died in 
Kiriatharba—the same is Hebron—in 
the land of Canaan; and Abraham 
came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep 
for her. 3And Abraham rose up from 
before his dead, and spoke unto the 
children of Heth, saying: 4’I am a 
stranger and a sojourner with you: give 
me a possession of a burying-place 
with you, that I may bury my dead out 
of my sight.’ 5And the children of Heth 
answered Abraham, saying unto him: 
6’Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty 
prince among us; in the choice of our 
sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us 
shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, 
but that thou mayest bury thy dead.’ 
7And Abraham rose up, and bowed 
down to the people of the land, even to 
23 




the children of Heth. 8And he spoke 
with them, saying: ‘If it be your mind 
that I should bury my dead out of my 
sight, hear me, and entreat for me to 
Ephron the son of Zohar, 9that he may 
give me the cave of Machpelah, which 
he hath, which is in the end of his 
field; for the full price let him give it 
to me in the midst of you for a 
possession of a burying-place.’ 10Now 
Ephron was sitting in the midst of the 
children of Heth; and Ephron the 
Hittite answered Abraham in the 
hearing of the children of Heth, even 
of all that went in at the gate of his 
city, saying: 11’Nay, my lord, hear me: 
the field give I thee, and the cave that 
is therein, I give it thee; in the 
presence of the sons of my people give 
I it thee; bury thy dead.’ 12And 
Abraham bowed down before the 
people of the land. 13And he spoke 
unto Ephron in the hearing of the 
people of the land, saying: ‘But if thou 
wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give 
the price of the field; take it of me, and 
I will bury my dead there.’ 14And 
Ephron answered Abraham, saying 
unto him: 15’My lord, hearken unto 
me: a piece of land worth four hundred 
shekels of silver, what is that betwixt 
me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.’ 
16And Abraham hearkened unto 
Ephron; and Abraham weighed to 
Ephron the silver, which he had named 
in the hearing of the children of Heth, 
four hundred shekels of silver, current 
money with the merchant. 17So the 
field of Ephron, which was in 
Machpelah, which was before Mamre, 
the field, and the cave which was 
therein, and all the trees that were in 
the field, that were in all the border 
thereof round about, were made 
sure18unto Abraham for a possession 
in the presence of the children of Heth, 
before all that went in at the gate of his 
city. 19And after this, Abraham buried 
Sarah his wife in the cave of the field 
of Machpelah before Mamre—the 
same is Hebron—in the land of 
Canaan. 20And the field, and the cave 
that is therein, were made sure unto 
Abraham for a possession of a 
burying-place by the children of Heth. 

And Abraham was old, well 
stricken in age; and the LORD 
had blessed Abraham in all things. 
2And Abraham said unto his servant, 
the elder of his house, that ruled over 
all that he had: ‘Put, I pray thee, thy 
hand under my thigh. 3And I will make 
thee swear by the LORD, the God of 
heaven and the God of the earth, that 
thou shalt not take a wife for my son 
of the daughters of the Canaanites, 
among whom I dwell. 4But thou shalt 
go unto my country, and to my 
kindred, and take a wife for my son, 
even for Isaac.’ 5And the servant said 
unto him: ‘Peradventure the woman 
will not be willing to follow me unto 
this land; must I needs bring thy son 
back unto the land from whence thou 
camest?’ 6And Abraham said unto 
him: ‘Beware thou that thou bring not 
my son back thither. 7The LORD, the 
God of heaven, who took me from my 
24 




father’s house, and from the land of 
my nativity, and who spoke unto me, 
and who swore unto me, saying: Unto 
thy seed will I give this land; He will 
send His angel before thee, and thou 
shalt take a wife for my son from 
thence. 8And if the woman be not 
willing to follow thee, then thou shalt 
be clear from this my oath; only thou 
shalt not bring my son back thither.’ 
9And the servant put his hand under 
the thigh of Abraham his master, and 
swore to him concerning this matter. 
10And the servant took ten camels, of 
the camels of his master, and departed; 
having all goodly things of his 
master’s in his hand; and he arose, and 
went to aAram-naharaim, unto the city 
of Nahor. 11And he made the camels to 
kneel down without the city by the 
well of water at the time of evening, 
the time that women go out to draw 
water. 12And he said: ‘O LORD, the God 
of my master Abraham, send me, I 
pray Thee, good speed this day, and 
show kindness unto my master 
Abraham. 13Behold, I stand by the 
fountain of water; and the daughters of 
the men of the city come out to draw 
water. 14So let it come to pass, that the 
damsel to whom I shall say: Let down 
thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may 
drink; and she shall say: Drink, and I 
will give thy camels drink also; let the 
same be she that Thou hast appointed 
for Thy servant, even for Isaac; and 
thereby shall I know that Thou hast 

a That is, Mesopotamia. 

shown kindness unto my master.’ 
15And it came to pass, before he had 
done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah 
came out, who was born to Bethuel the 
son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, 
Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher 
upon her shoulder. 16And the damsel 
was very fair to look upon, a virgin, 
neither had any man known her; and 
she went down to the fountain, and 
filled her pitcher, and came up. 17And 
the servant ran to meet her, and said: 
‘Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little 
water of thy pitcher.’ 18And she said: 
‘Drink, my lord’; and she hastened, 
and let down her pitcher upon her 
hand, and gave him drink. 19And when 
she had done giving him drink, she 
said: ‘I will draw for thy camels also, 
until they have done drinking.’ 20And 
she hastened, and emptied her pitcher 
into the trough, and ran again unto the 
well to draw, and drew for all his 
camels. 21And the man looked 
stedfastly on her; holding his peace, to 
know whether the LORD had made his 
journey prosperous or not. 22And it 
came to pass, as the camels had done 
drinking, that the man took a golden 
ring of half a shekel weight, and two 
bracelets for her hands of ten shekels 
weight of gold; 23and said: ‘Whose 
daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. 
Is there room in thy father’s house for 
us to lodge in?’ 24And she said unto 
him: ‘I am the daughter of Bethuel the 
son of Milcah, whom she bore unto 
Nahor.’ 25She said moreover unto him: 
‘We have both straw and provender 


enough, and room to lodge in.’ 26And 
the man bowed his head, and 
prostrated himself before the LORD. 
27And he said: ‘Blessed be the LORD, 
the God of my master Abraham, who 
hath not forsaken His mercy and His 
truth toward my master; as for me, the 
LORD hath led me in the way to the 
house of my master’s brethren.’ 28And 
the damsel ran, and told her mother’s 
house according to these words. 29And 
Rebekah had a brother, and his name 
was Laban; and Laban ran out unto the 
man, unto the fountain. 30And it came 
to pass, when he saw the ring, and the 
bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and 
when he heard the words of Rebekah 
his sister, saying: ‘Thus spoke the man 
unto me, ‘that he came unto the man; 
and, behold, he stood by the camels at 
the fountain. 31And he said: ‘Come in, 
thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore 
standest thou without? for I have 
cleared the house, and made room for 
the camels.’ 32And the man came into 
the house, and he ungirded the camels; 
and he gave straw and provender for 
the camels, and water to wash his feet 
and the feet of the men that were with 
him. 33And there was set food before 
him to eat; but he said: ‘I will not eat, 
until I have told mine errand.’ And he 
said: ‘Speak on.’ 34And he said: ‘I am 
Abraham’s servant. 35And the LORD 
hath blessed my master greatly; and he 
is become great; and He hath given 
him flocks and herds, and silver and 
gold, and men-servants and maid-
servants, and camels and asses. 36And 
Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to 
my master when she was old; and unto 
him hath he given all that he hath. 
37And my master made me swear, 
saying: Thou shalt not take a wife for 
my son of the daughters of the 
Canaanites, in whose land I dwell. 
38But thou shalt go unto my father’s 
house, and to my kindred, and take a 
wife for my son. 39And I said unto my 
master: Peradventure the woman will 
not follow me. 40And he said unto me: 
The LORD, before whom I walk, will 
send His angel with thee, and prosper 
thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for 
my son of my kindred, and of my 
father’s house; 41then shalt thou be 
clear from my oath, when thou comest 
to my kindred; and if they give her not 
to thee, thou shalt be clear from my 
oath. 42And I came this day unto the 
fountain, and said: O LORD, the God of 
my master Abraham, if now Thou do 
prosper my way which I go: 43behold, I 
stand by the fountain of water; and let 
it come to pass, that the maiden that 
cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall 
say: Give me, I pray thee, a little water 
from thy pitcher to drink; 44and she 
shall say to me: Both drink thou, and I 
will also draw for thy camels; let the 
same be the woman whom the LORD 
hath appointed for my master’s son. 
45And before I had done speaking to 
my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth 
with her pitcher on her shoulder; and 
she went down unto the fountain, and 
drew. And I said unto her: Let me 
drink, I pray thee. 46And she made 


haste, and let down her pitcher from 
her shoulder, and said: Drink, and I 
will give thy camels drink also. So I 
drank, and she made the camels drink 
also. 47And I asked her, and said: 
Whose daughter art thou? And she 
said: The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s 
son, whom Milcah bore unto him. And 
I put the ring upon her nose, and the 
bracelets upon her hands. 48And I 
bowed my head, and prostrated myself 
before the LORD, and blessed the LORD, 
the God of my master Abraham, who 
had led me in the right way to take my 
master’s brother’s daughter for his 
son. 49And now if ye will deal kindly 
and truly with my master, tell me; and 
if not, tell me; that I may turn to the 
right hand, or to the left.’ 50Then 
Laban and Bethuel answered and said: 
‘The thing proceedeth from the LORD; 
we cannot speak unto thee bad or 
good. 51Behold, Rebekah is before 
thee, take her, and go, and let her be 
thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD 
hath spoken.’ 52And it came to pass, 
that, when Abraham’s servant heard 
their words, he bowed himself down to 
the earth unto the LORD. 53And the 
servant brought forth jewels of silver, 
and jewels of gold, and raiment, and 
gave them to Rebekah; he gave also to 
her brother and to her mother precious 
things. 54And they did eat and drink, 
he and the men that were with him, 
and tarried all night; and they rose up 
in the morning, and he said: ‘Send me 
away unto my master.’ 55And her 
brother and her mother said: ‘Let the 
damsel abide with us a few days, at the 
least ten; after that she shall go.’ 56And 
he said unto them: ‘Delay me not, 
seeing the LORD hath prospered my 
way; send me away that I may go to 
my master.’ 57And they said: ‘We will 
call the damsel, and inquire at her 
mouth.’ 58And they called Rebekah, 
and said unto her: ‘Wilt thou go with 
this man?’ And she said: ‘I will go.’ 
59And they sent away Rebekah their 
sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s 
servant, and his men. 60And they 
blessed Rebekah, and said unto her: 
‘Our sister, be thou the mother of 
thousands of ten thousands, and let thy 
seed possess the gate of those that hate 
them.’ 61And Rebekah arose, and her 
damsels, and they rode upon the 
camels, and followed the man. And the 
servant took Rebekah, and went his 
way. 62And Isaac came from the way 
of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the 
land of the South. 63And Isaac went 
out to meditate in the field at the 
eventide; and he lifted up his eyes, and 
saw, and, behold, there were camels 
coming. 64And Rebekah lifted up her 
eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she 
alighted from the camel. 65And she 
said unto the servant: ‘What man is 
this that walketh in the field to meet 
us?’ And the servant said: ‘It is my 
master.’ And she took her veil, and 
covered herself. 66And the servant told 
Isaac all the things that he had done. 
67And Isaac brought her into his 
mother Sarah’s tent, and took 
Rebekah, and she became his wife; 


and he loved her. And Isaac was 
comforted for his mother. 

And Abraham took another 
wife, and her name was 
Keturah. 2And she bore him Zimran, 
and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, 
and Ishbak, and Shuah. 3And Jokshan 
begot Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons 
of Dedan were Asshurim, and 
Letushim, and Leummim. 4And the 
sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and 
Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All 
these were the children of Keturah. 
5And Abraham gave all that he had 
unto Isaac. 6But unto the sons of the 
concubines, that Abraham had, 
Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them 
away from Isaac his son, while he yet 
lived, eastward, unto the east country. 
7And these are the days of the years of 
Abraham’s life which he lived, a 
hundred threescore and fifteen years. 
8And Abraham expired, and died in a 
good old age, an old man, and full of 
years; and was gathered to his people. 
9And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried 
him in the cave of Machpelah, in the 
field of Ephron the son of Zohar the 
Hittite, which is before Mamre; 10the 
field which Abraham purchased of the 
children of Heth; there was Abraham 
buried, and Sarah his wife. 11And it 
came to pass after the death of 
Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his 
son; and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi. 

12Now these are the generations of 
Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar 
the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore 
unto Abraham. 13And these are the 
names of the sons of Ishmael, by their 
names, according to their generations: 
the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; 
and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 
14and Mishma, and Dumah, and 
Massa; 15Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, 
Naphish, and Kedem; 16these are the 
sons of Ishmael, and these are their 
names, by their villages, and by their 
encampments; twelve princes 
according to their nations. 17And these 
are the years of the life of Ishmael, a 
hundred and thirty and seven years; 
and he expired and died; and was 
gathered unto his people. 18And they 
dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is 
before Egypt, as thou goest toward 
Asshur: over against all his brethren he 
did settle. 


19And these are the generations of 
Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begot 
Isaac. 20And Isaac was forty years old 
when he took Rebekah, the daughter of 
Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, 
the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be 
his wife. 21And Isaac entreated the 
LORD for his wife, because she was 
barren; and the LORD let Himself be 
entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife 
conceived. 22And the children 
struggled together within her; and she 
said: ‘If it be so, wherefore do I live?’ 
And she went to inquire of the LORD. 
23And the LORD said unto her: 

Two nations are in thy womb, 

And two peoples shall be separated 
from thy bowels; 
25 




And the one people shall be stronger 
than the other people; 

And the elder shall serve the 
younger. 

24And when her days to be delivered 
were fulfilled, behold, there were 
twins in her womb. 25And the first 
came forth ruddy, all over like a hairy 
mantle; and they called his name Esau. 
26And after that came forth his brother, 
and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel; 
and his name was called aJacob. And 
Isaac was threescore years old when 
she bore them. 27And the boys grew; 
and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man 
of the field; and Jacob was a quiet 
man, dwelling in tents. 28Now Isaac 
loved Esau, because he did eat of his 
venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob. 
29And Jacob sod pottage; and Esau 
came in from the field, and he was 
faint. 30And Esau said to Jacob: ‘Let 
me swallow, I pray thee, some of this 
red, red pottage; for I am faint.’ 
Therefore was his name called bEdom. 
31And Jacob said: ‘Sell me first thy 
birth right.’ 32And Esau said: ‘Behold, 
I am at the point to die; and what profit 
shall the birthright do to me?’ 33And 
Jacob said: ‘Swear to me first’; and he 
swore unto him; and he sold his 
birthright unto Jacob. 34And Jacob 
gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; 
and he did eat and drink, and rose up, 

a That is, One that takes by the heel, 
or, supplants. 

b That is, Red. 

and went his way. So Esau despised 
his birthright. 

And there was a famine in the 
land, beside the first famine 
that was in the days of Abraham. And 
Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the 
Philistines unto Gerar. 2And the LORD 
appeared unto him, and said: ‘Go not 
down unto Egypt; dwell in the land 
which I shall tell thee of. 3Sojourn in 
this land, and I will be with thee, and 
will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto 
thy seed, I will give all these lands, 
and I will establish the oath which I 
swore unto Abraham thy father; 4and I 
will multiply thy seed as the stars of 
heaven, and will give unto thy seed all 
these lands; and by thy seed shall all 
the nations of the earth bless 
themselves; 5because that Abraham 
hearkened to My voice, and kept My 
charge, My commandments, My 
statutes, and My laws.’ 6And Isaac 
dwelt in Gerar. 7And the men of the 
place asked him of his wife; and he 
said: ‘She is my sister’; for he feared 
to say: ‘My wife’; ‘lest the men of the 
place should kill me for Rebekah, 
because she is fair to look upon.’ 8And 
it came to pass, when he had been 
there a long time, that Abimelech king 
of the Philistines looked out at a 
window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac 
was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 
9And Abimelech called Isaac, and said: 
‘Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; 
and how saidst thou: She is my sister?’ 
And Isaac said unto him: ‘Because I 
said: Lest I die because of her.’ 10And 
26 




Abimelech said: ‘What is this thou 
hast done unto us? one of the people 
might easily have lain with thy wife, 
and thou wouldest have brought 
guiltiness upon us.’ 11And Abimelech 
charged all the people, saying: ‘He that 
toucheth this man or his wife shall 
surely be put to death.’ 12And Isaac 
sowed in that land, and found in the 
same year a hundred-fold; and the 
LORD blessed him. 13And the man 
waxed great, and grew more and more 
until he became very great. 14And he 
had possessions of flocks, and 
possessions of herds, and a great 
household; and the Philistines envied 
him. 15Now all the wells which his 
father’s servants had digged in the 
days of Abraham his father, the 
Philistines had stopped them, and 
filled them with earth. 16And 
Abimelech said unto Isaac: ‘Go from 
us; for thou art much mightier than 
we.’ 17And Isaac departed thence, and 
encamped in the valley of Gerar, and 
dwelt there. 18And Isaac digged again 
the wells of water, which they had 
digged in the days of Abraham his 
father; for the Philistines had stopped 
them after the death of Abraham; and 
he called their names after the names 
by which his father had called them. 
19And Isaac’s servants digged in the 
valley, and found there a well of living 
water. 20And the herdmen of Gerar 
strove with Isaac’s herdmen, saying: 
‘The water is ours.’ And he called the 
name of the well aEsek; because they 
contended with him. 21And they 
digged another well, and they strove 
for that also. And he called the name 
of it bSitnah. 22And he removed from 
thence, and digged another well; and 
for that they strove not. And he called 
the name of it cRehoboth; and he said: 
‘For now the LORD hath made room for 
us, and we shall be fruitful in the 
land.’ 23And he went up from thence to 
Beer-sheba. 24And the LORD appeared 
unto him the same night, and said: ‘I 
am the God of Abraham thy father. 
Fear not, for I am with thee, and will 
bless thee, and multiply thy seed for 
My servant Abraham’s sake.’ 25And he 
builded an altar there, and called upon 
the name of the LORD, and pitched his 
tent there; and there Isaac’s servants 
digged a well. 26Then Abimelech went 
to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his 
friend, and Phicol the captain of his 
host. 27And Isaac said unto them: 
‘Wherefore are ye come unto me, 
seeing ye hate me, and have sent me 
away from you?’ 28And they said: ‘We 
saw plainly that the LORD was with 
thee; and we said: Let there now be an 
oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and 
thee, and let us make a covenant with 
thee; 29that thou wilt do us no hurt, as 
we have not touched thee, and as we 
have done unto thee nothing but good, 
and have sent thee away in peace; thou 

a That is, Contention. 

b That is, Enmity. 

c That is, Room. 


art now the blessed of the LORD.’ 
30And he made them a feast, and they 
did eat and drink. 31And they rose up 
betimes in the morning, and swore one 
to another; and Isaac sent them away, 
and they departed from him in peace. 
32And it came to pass the same day, 
that Isaac’s servants came, and told 
him concerning the well which they 
had digged, and said unto him: ‘We 
have found water.’ 33And he called it 
Shibah. Therefore the name of the city 
is Beer-sheba unto this day. 

34And when Esau was forty years 
old, he took to wife Judith the 
daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and 
Basemath the daughter of Elon the 
Hittite. 35And they were a bitterness of 
spirit unto Isaac and to Rebekah. 

And it came to pass, that when 
Isaac was old, and his eyes 
were dim, so that he could not see, he 
called Esau his elder son, and said 
unto him: ‘My son’; and he said unto 
him: ‘Here am I.’ 2And he said: 
‘Behold now, I am old, I know not the 
day of my death. 3Now therefore take, 
I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver 
and thy bow, and go out to the field, 
and take me venison; 4and make me 
savoury food, such as I love, and bring 
it to me, that I may eat; that my soul 
may bless thee before I die.’ 5And 
Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to 
Esau his son. And Esau went to the 
field to hunt for venison, and to bring 
it. 6And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her 
son, saying: ‘Behold, I heard thy father 
speak unto Esau thy brother, saying: 
7Bring me venison, and make me 
savoury food, that I may eat, and bless 
thee before the LORD before my death. 
8Now therefore, my son, hearken to 
my voice according to that which I 
command thee. 9Go now to the flock, 
and fetch me from thence two good 
kids of the goats; and I will make them 
savoury food for thy father, such as he 
loveth; 10and thou shalt bring it to thy 
father, that he may eat, so that he may 
bless thee before his death.’ 11And 
Jacob said to Rebekah his mother: 
‘Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy 
man, and I am a smooth man. 12My 
father peradventure will feel me, and I 
shall seem to him as a mocker; and I 
shall bring a curse upon me, and not a 
blessing.’ 13And his mother said unto 
him: ‘Upon me be thy curse, my son; 
only hearken to my voice, and go fetch 
me them.’ 14And he went, and fetched, 
and brought them to his mother; and 
his mother made savoury food, such as 
his father loved. 15And Rebekah took 
the choicest garments of Esau her 
elder son, which were with her in the 
house, and put them upon Jacob her 
younger son. 16And she put the skins 
of the kids of the goats upon his hands, 
and upon the smooth of his neck. 
17And she gave the savoury food and 
the bread, which she had prepared, 
into the hand of her son Jacob. 18And 
he came unto his father, and said: ‘My 
father’; and he said: ‘Here am I; who 
art thou, my son?’ 19And Jacob said 
unto his father: ‘I am Esau thy first-
born; I have done according as thou 
27 




badest me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and 
eat of my venison, that thy soul may 
bless me.’ 20And Isaac said unto his 
son: ‘How is it that thou hast found it 
so quickly, my son?’ And he said: 
‘Because the LORD thy God sent me 
good speed.’ 21And Isaac said unto 
Jacob: ‘Come near, I pray thee, that I 
may feel thee, my son, whether thou 
be my very son Esau or not.’ 22And 
Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; 
and he felt him, and said: ‘The voice is 
the voice of Jacob, but the hands are 
the hands of Esau.’ 23And he discerned 
him not, because his hands were hairy, 
as his brother Esau’s hands; so he 
blessed him. 24And he said: ‘Art thou 
my very son Esau?’ And he said: ‘I 
am.’ 25And he said: ‘Bring it near to 
me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, 
that my soul may bless thee.’ And he 
brought it near to him, and he did eat; 
and he brought him wine, and he 
drank. 26And his father Isaac said unto 
him: ‘Come near now, and kiss me, 
my son.’ 27And he came near, and 
kissed him. And he smelled the smell 
of his raiment, and blessed him, and 
said: 

See, the smell of my son 

Is as the smell of a field which the 
LORD hath blessed. 

28So God give thee of the dew of 
heaven, 

And of the fat places of the earth, 

And plenty of corn and wine. 

29Let peoples serve thee, 

And nations bow down to thee. 

Be lord over thy brethren, 

And let thy mother’s sons bow 
down to thee. 

Cursed be every one that curseth 
thee, 

And blessed be every one that 
blesseth thee. 

30And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac 
had made an end of blessing Jacob, 
and Jacob was yet scarce gone out 
from the presence of Isaac his father, 
that Esau his brother came in from his 
hunting. 31And he also made savoury 
food, and brought it unto his father; 
and he said unto his father: ‘Let my 
father arise, and eat of his son’s 
venison, that thy soul may bless me.’ 
32And Isaac his father said unto him: 
‘Who art thou?’ And he said: ‘I am thy 
son, thy first-born, Esau.’ 33And Isaac 
trembled very exceedingly, and said: 
‘Who then is he that hath taken 
venison, and brought it me, and I have 
eaten of all before thou camest, and 
have blessed him? yea, and he shall be 
blessed.’ 34When Esau heard the words 
of his father, he cried with an 
exceeding great and bitter cry, and said 
unto his father: ‘Bless me, even me 
also, O my father.’ 35And he said: ‘Thy 
brother came with guile, and hath 
taken away thy blessing.’ 36And he 
said: ‘Is not he rightly named Jacob? 
for he hath supplanted me these two 
times: he took away my birthright; 
and, behold, now he hath taken away 
my blessing.’ And he said: ‘Hast thou 
not reserved a blessing for me?’ 37And 
Isaac answered and said unto Esau: 
‘Behold, I have made him thy lord, 


and all his brethren have I given to 
him for servants; and with corn and 
wine have I sustained him; and what 
then shall I do for thee, my son?’ 
38And Esau said unto his father: ‘Hast 
thou but one blessing, my father? bless 
me, even me also, O my father.’ And 
Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 
39And Isaac his father answered and 
said unto him: 

Behold, of the fat places of the earth 
shall be thy dwelling, 

And of the dew of heaven from 
above; 

40And by thy sword shalt thou live, 

And thou shalt serve thy brother; 

And it shall come to pass when thou 
shalt break loose, 

That thou shalt shake his yoke from 
off thy neck. 

41And Esau hated Jacob because of the 
blessing wherewith his father blessed 
him. And Esau said in his heart: ‘Let 
the days of mourning for my father be 
at hand; then will I slay my brother 
Jacob.’ 42And the words of Esau her 
elder son were told to Rebekah; and 
she sent and called Jacob her younger 
son, and said unto him: ‘Behold, thy 
brother Esau, as touching thee, doth 
comfort himself, purposing to kill thee. 
43Now therefore, my son, hearken to 
my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban 
my brother to Haran; 44and tarry with 
him a few days, until thy brother’s 
fury turn away; 45until thy brother’s 
anger turn away from thee, and he 
forget that which thou hast done to 
him; then I will send, and fetch thee 
from thence; why should I be bereaved 
of you both in one day?’ 

46And Rebekah said to Isaac: ‘I am 
weary of my life because of the 
daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife 
of the daughters of Heth, such as these, 
of the daughters of the land, what good 
shall my life do me?’ 

And Isaac called Jacob, and 
blessed him, and charged him, 
and said unto him: ‘Thou shalt not take 
a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 
2Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the 
house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; 
and take thee a wife from thence of the 
daughters of Laban thy mother’s 
brother. 3And God Almighty bless 
thee, and make thee fruitful, and 
multiply thee, that thou mayest be a 
congregation of peoples; 4and give 
thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, 
and to thy seed with thee; that thou 
mayest inherit the land of thy 
sojournings, which God gave unto 
Abraham.’ 5And Isaac sent away 
Jacob; and he went to Paddan-aram 
unto Laban, son of Bethuel the 
Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, 
Jacob’s and Esau’s mother. 6Now Esau 
saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and 
sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take 
him a wife from thence; and that as he 
blessed him he gave him a charge, 
saying: ‘Thou shalt not take a wife of 
the daughters of Canaan’; 7and that 
Jacob hearkened to his father and his 
mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram; 
8and Esau saw that the daughters of 
Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 
28 




9so Esau went unto Ishmael, and took 
unto the wives that he had Mahalath 
the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s 
son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his 
wife. 


10And Jacob went out from Beer-
sheba, and went toward Haran. 11And 
he lighted upon the place, and tarried 
there all night, because the sun was 
set; and he took one of the stones of 
the place, and put it under his head, 
and lay down in that place to sleep. 
12And he dreamed, and behold a ladder 
set up on the earth, and the top of it 
reached to heaven; and behold the 
angels of God ascending and 
descending on it. 13And, behold, the 
LORD stood beside him, and said: ‘I am 
the LORD, the God of Abraham thy 
father, and the God of Isaac. The land 
whereon thou liest, to thee will I give 
it, and to thy seed. 14And thy seed shall 
be as the dust of the earth, and thou 
shalt spread abroad to the west, and to 
the east, and to the north, and to the 
south. And in thee and in thy seed 
shall all the families of the earth be 
blessed. 15And, behold, I am with thee, 
and will keep thee whithersoever thou 
goest, and will bring thee back into 
this land; for I will not leave thee, until 
I have done that which I have spoken 
to thee of.’ 16And Jacob awaked out of 
his sleep, and he said: ‘Surely the LORD 
is in this place; and I knew it not.’ 
17And he was afraid, and said: ‘How 
full of awe is this place! this is none 
other than the house of God, and this is 
the gate of heaven.’ 18And Jacob rose 
up early in the morning, and took the 
stone that he had put under his head, 
and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil 
upon the top of it. 19And he called the 
name of that place aBeth-el, but the 
name of the city was Luz at the first. 
20And Jacob vowed a vow, saying: ‘If 
God will be with me, and will keep me 
in this way that I go, and will give me 
bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 
21so that I come back to my father’s 
house in peace, then shall the LORD be 
my God, 22and this stone, which I have 
set up for a pillar, shall be God’s 
house; and of all that Thou shalt give 
me I will surely give the tenth unto 
Thee.’ 

a That is, The house of God. 

29 



Then Jacob went on his 
journey, and came to the land 
of the children of the east. 2And he 
looked, and behold a well in the field, 
and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying 
there by it.—For out of that well they 
watered the flocks. And the stone upon 
the well’s mouth was great. 3And 
thither were all the flocks gathered; 
and they rolled the stone from the 
well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, 
and put the stone back upon the well’s 
mouth in its place.— 4And Jacob said 
unto them: ‘My brethren, whence are 
ye?’ And they said: ‘Of Haran are we.’ 
5And he said unto them: ‘Know ye 
Laban the son of Nahor?’ And they 
said: ‘We know him.’ 6And he said 
unto them: ‘Is it well with him?’ And 


they said: ‘It is well; and, behold, 
Rachel his daughter cometh with the 
sheep.’ 7And he said: ‘Lo, it is yet high 
day, neither is it time that the cattle 
should be gathered together; water ye 
the sheep, and go and feed them.’ 
8And they said: ‘We cannot, until all 
the flocks be gathered together, and 
they roll the stone from the well’s 
mouth; then we water the sheep.’ 
9While he was yet speaking with them, 
Rachel came with her father’s sheep; 
for she tended them. 10And it came to 
pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the 
daughter of Laban his mother’s 
brother, and the sheep of Laban his 
mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, 
and rolled the stone from the well’s 
mouth, and watered the flock of Laban 
his mother’s brother. 11And Jacob 
kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, 
and wept. 12And Jacob told Rachel that 
he was her father’s brother, and that he 
was Rebekah’s son; and she ran and 
told her father. 13And it came to pass, 
when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob 
his sister’s son, that he ran to meet 
him, and embraced him, and kissed 
him, and brought him to his house. 
And he told Laban all these things. 
14And Laban said to him: ‘Surely thou 
art my bone and my flesh.’ And he 
abode with him the space of a month. 
15And Laban said unto Jacob: 
‘Because thou art my brother, 
shouldest thou therefore serve me for 
nought? tell me, what shall thy wages 
be?’ 16Now Laban had two daughters: 
the name of the elder was Leah, and 
the name of the younger was Rachel. 
17And Leah’s eyes were weak; but 
Rachel was of beautiful form and fair 
to look upon. 18And Jacob loved 
Rachel; and he said: ‘I will serve thee 
seven years for Rachel thy younger 
daughter.’ 19And Laban said: ‘It is 
better that I give her to thee, than that I 
should give her to another man; abide 
with me.’ 20And Jacob served seven 
years for Rachel; and they seemed 
unto him but a few days, for the love 
he had to her. 21And Jacob said unto 
Laban: ‘Give me my wife, for my days 
are filled, that I may go in unto her.’ 
22And Laban gathered together all the 
men of the place, and made a feast. 
23And it came to pass in the evening, 
that he took Leah his daughter, and 
brought her to him; and he went in 
unto her. 24And Laban gave Zilpah his 
handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a 
handmaid. 25And it came to pass in the 
morning that, behold, it was Leah; and 
he said to Laban: ‘What is this thou 
hast done unto me? did not I serve 
with thee for Rachel? wherefore then 
hast thou beguiled me?’ 26And Laban 
said: ‘It is not so done in our place, to 
give the younger before the first-born. 
27Fulfil the week of this one, and we 
will give thee the other also for the 
service which thou shalt serve with me 
yet seven other years.’ 28And Jacob did 
so, and fulfilled her week; and he gave 
him Rachel his daughter to wife. 29And 
Laban gave to Rachel his daughter 
Bilhah his handmaid to be her 
handmaid. 30And he went in also unto 


Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than 
Leah, and served with him yet seven 
other years. 

31And the LORD saw that Leah was 
hated, and he opened her womb; but 
Rachel was barren. 32And Leah 
conceived, and bore a son, and she 
called his name Reuben; for she said: 
‘Because the LORD ahath looked upon 
my affliction; for now my husband 
will love me.’ 33And she conceived 
again, and bore a son; and said: 
‘Because the LORD bhath heard that I 
am hated, He hath therefore given me 
this son also.’ And she called his name 
cSimeon. 34And she conceived again, 
and bore a son; and said: ‘Now this 
time will my husband be djoined unto 
me, because I have borne him three 
sons.’ Therefore was his name called 
Levi. 35And she conceived again, and 
bore a son; and she said: ‘This time 
will I epraise the LORD.’ Therefore she 
called his name fJudah; and she left off 
bearing.

30 



And when Rachel saw that she 
bore Jacob no children, Rachel 
envied her sister; and she said unto 
Jacob: ‘Give me children, or else I 
die.’ 2And Jacob’s anger was kindled 
against Rachel; and he said: ‘Am I in 
God’s stead, who hath withheld from 

thee the fruit of the womb?’ 3And she 
said: ‘Behold my maid Bilhah, go in 
unto her; that she may bear upon my 
knees, and I also may be builded up 
through her.’ 4And she gave him 
Bilhah her handmaid to wife; and 
Jacob went in unto her. 5And Bilhah 
conceived, and bore Jacob a son. 6And 
Rachel said: ‘God hath gjudged me, 
and hath also heard my voice, and hath 
given me a son.’ Therefore called she 
his name Dan. 7And Bilhah Rachel’s 
handmaid conceived again, and bore 
Jacob a second son. 8And Rachel said: 
‘With mighty wrestlings have I 
hwrestled with my sister, and have 
prevailed.’ And she called his name 
Naphtali. 9When Leah saw that she 
had left off bearing, she took Zilpah 
her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to 
wife. 10And Zilpah Leah’s handmaid 
bore Jacob a son. 11And Leah said: 
‘Fortune is come! ’ And she called his 
name iGad. 12And Zilpah Leah’s 
handmaid bore Jacob a second son. 
13And Leah said: ‘Happy am I! for the 
daughters will call me happy.’ And she 
called his name jAsher. 14And Reuben 
went in the days of wheat harvest, and 
found mandrakes in the field, and 
brought them unto his mother Leah. 
Then Rachel said to Leah: ‘Give me, I 
pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.’ 
15And she said unto her: ‘Is it a small 

g Heb. dan, he judged. 

h Heb. niphtal, he wrestled. 

i That is, Fortune. 

j That is, Happy. 


matter that thou hast taken away my 
husband? and wouldest thou take away 
my son’s mandrakes also?’ And 
Rachel said: ‘Therefore he shall lie 
with thee to-night for thy son’s 
mandrakes.’ 16And Jacob came from 
the field in the evening, and Leah went 
out to meet him, and said: ‘Thou must 
come in unto me; for I have surely 
hired thee with my son’s mandrakes.’ 
And he lay with her that night. 17And 
God hearkened unto Leah, and she 
conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
18And Leah said: ‘God hath given me 
my ahire, because I gave my handmaid 
to my husband. And she called his 
name Issachar. 19And Leah conceived 
again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob. 
20And Leah said: ‘God hath endowed 
me with a good dowry; now will my 
husband bdwell with me, because I 
have borne him six sons.’ And she 
called his name Zebulun. 21And 
afterwards she bore a daughter, and 
called her name Dinah. 22And God 
remembered Rachel, and God 
hearkened to her, and opened her 
womb. 23And she conceived, and bore 
a son, and said: ‘God chath taken away 
my reproach.’ 24And she called his 
name Joseph, saying: ‘The LORD dadd 
to me another son.’ 

a Heb. sachar. 

b Heb. sabal, he dwelt. 

c Heb. asaph. 

d Heb. joseph. 

25And it came to pass, when Rachel 
had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto 

Laban: ‘Send me away, that I may go 
unto mine own place, and to my 
country. 26Give me my wives and my 
children for whom I have served thee, 
and let me go; for thou knowest my 
service wherewith I have served thee.’ 
27And Laban said unto him: ‘If now I 
have found favour in thine eyes—I 
have observed the signs, and the LORD 
hath blessed me for thy sake.’ 28And 
he said: ‘Appoint me thy wages, and I 
will give it.’ 29And he said unto him: 
‘Thou knowest how I have served 
thee, and how thy cattle have fared 
with me. 30For it was little which thou 
hadst before I came, and it hath 
increased abundantly; and the LORD 
hath blessed thee whithersoever I 
turned. And now when shall I provide 
for mine own house also?’ 31And he 
said: ‘What shall I give thee?’ And 
Jacob said: ‘Thou shalt not give me 
aught; if thou wilt do this thing for me, 
I will again feed thy flock and keep it. 
32I will pass through all thy flock to-
day, removing from thence every 
speckled and spotted one, and every 
dark one among the sheep, and the 
spotted and speckled among the goats; 
and of such shall be my hire. 33So shall 
my righteousness witness against me 
hereafter, when thou shalt come to 
look over my hire that is before thee: 
every one that is not speckled and 
spotted among the goats, and dark 
among the sheep, that if found with me 
shall be counted stolen.’ 34And Laban 
said: ‘Behold, would it might be 
according to thy word.’ 35And he 


removed that day the he-goats that 
were streaked and spotted, and all the 
she-goats that were speckled and 
spotted, every one that had white in it, 
and all the dark ones among the sheep, 
and gave them into the hand of his 
sons. 36And he set three days’journey 
betwixt himself and Jacob. And Jacob 
fed the rest of Laban’s flocks. 37And 
Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, 
and of the almond and of the plane-
tree; and peeled white streaks in them, 
making the white appear which was in 
the rods. 38And he set the rods which 
he had peeled over against the flocks 
in the gutters in the watering-troughs 
where the flocks came to drink; and 
they conceived when they came to 
drink. 39And the flocks conceived at 
the sight of the rods, and the flocks 
brought forth streaked, speckled, and 
spotted. 40And Jacob separated the 
lambs—he also set the faces of the 
flocks toward the streaked and all the 
dark in the flock of Laban— and put 
his own droves apart, and put them not 
unto Laban’s flock. 41And it came to 
pass, whensoever the stronger of the 
flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the 
rods before the eyes of the flock in the 
gutters, that they might conceive 
among the rods; 42but when the flock 
were feeble, he put them not in; so the 
feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger 
Jacob’s. 43And the man increased 
exceedingly, and had large flocks, and 
maid-servants and men-servants, and 
camels and asses. 

And he heard the words of 
Laban’s sons, saying: ‘Jacob hath 
taken away all that was our father’s; 
and of that which was our father’s hath 
he gotten all this wealth.’ 2And Jacob 
beheld the countenance of Laban, and, 
behold, it was not toward him as 
beforetime. 3And the LORD said unto 
Jacob: ‘Return unto the land of thy 
fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will 
be with thee.’ 4And Jacob sent and 
called Rachel and Leah to the field 
unto his flock, 5and said unto them: ‘I 
see your father’s countenance, that it is 
not toward me as beforetime; but the 
God of my father hath been with me. 
6And ye know that with all my power I 
have served your father. 7And your 
father hath mocked me, and changed 
my wages ten times; but God suffered 
him not to hurt me. 8If he said thus: 
The speckled shall be thy wages; then 
all the flock bore speckled; and if he 
said thus: The streaked shall be thy 
wages; then bore all the flock streaked. 
9Thus God hath taken away the cattle 
of your father, and given them to me. 
10And it came to pass at the time that 
the flock conceived, that I lifted up 
mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, 
behold, the he-goats which leaped 
upon the flock were streaked, 
speckled, and grizzled. 11And the angel 
of God said unto me in the dream: 
Jacob; and I said: Here am I. 12And he 
said: Lift up now thine eyes, and see, 
all the he-goats which leap upon the 
flock are streaked, speckled, and 
grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban 
doeth unto thee. 13I am the God of 31 




Beth-el, where thou didst anoint a 
pillar, where thou didst vow a vow 
unto Me. Now arise, get thee out from 
this land, and return unto the land of 
thy nativity.’ 14And Rachel and Leah 
answered and said unto him: ‘Is there 
yet any portion or inheritance for us in 
our father’s house? 15Are we not 
accounted by him strangers? for he 
hath sold us, and hath also quite 
devoured our price. 16For all the riches 
which God hath taken away from our 
father, that is ours and our children’s. 
Now then, whatsoever God hath said 
unto thee, do.’ 17Then Jacob rose up, 
and set his sons and his wives upon the 
camels; 18and he carried away all his 
cattle, and all his substance which he 
had gathered, the cattle of his getting, 
which he had gathered in Paddan-
aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the 
land of Canaan. 19Now Laban was 
gone to shear his sheep. And Rachel 
stole the teraphim that were her 
father’s. 20And Jacob outwitted Laban 
the Aramean, in that he told him not 
that he fled. 21So he fled with all that 
he had; and he rose up, and passed 
over athe River, and set his face toward 
the mountain of Gilead. 

a That is the Euphrates. 

22And it was told Laban on the third 
day that Jacob was fled. 23And he took 
his brethren with him, and pursued 
after him seven days’journey; and he 
overtook him in the mountain of 
Gilead. 24And God came to Laban the 
Aramean in a dream of the night, and 

said unto him: ‘Take heed to thyself 
that thou speak not to Jacob either 
good or bad.’ 25And Laban came up 
with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his 
tent in the mountain; and Laban with 
his brethren pitched in the mountain of 
Gilead. 26And Laban said to Jacob: 
‘What hast thou done, that thou hast 
outwitted me, and carried away my 
daughters as though captives of the 
sword? 27Wherefore didst thou flee 
secretly, and outwit me; and didst not 
tell me, that I might have sent thee 
away with mirth and with songs, with 
tabret and with harp; 28and didst not 
suffer me to kiss my sons and my 
daughters? now hast thou done 
foolishly. 29It is in the power of my 
hand to do you hurt; but the God of 
your father spoke unto me yesternight, 
saying: Take heed to thyself that thou 
speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 
30And now that thou art surely gone, 
because thou sore longest after thy 
father’s house, wherefore hast thou 
stolen my gods?’ 31And Jacob 
answered and said to Laban: ‘Because 
I was afraid; for I said: Lest thou 
shouldest take thy daughters from me 
by force. 32With whomsoever thou 
findest thy gods, he shall not live; 
before our brethren discern thou what 
is thine with me, and take it to thee.’—
For Jacob knew not that Rachel had 
stolen them.— 33And Laban went into 
Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and 
into the tent of the two maid-servants; 
but he found them not. And he went 
out of Leah’s tent, and entered into 


Rachel’s tent. 34Now Rachel had taken 
the teraphim, and put them in the 
saddle of the camel, and sat upon 
them. And Laban felt about all the 
tent, but found them not. 35And she 
said to her father: ‘Let not my lord be 
angry that I cannot rise up before thee; 
for the manner of women is upon me.’ 
And he searched, but found not the 
teraphim. 36And Jacob was wroth, and 
strove with Laban. And Jacob 
answered and said to Laban: ‘What is 
my trespass? what is my sin, that thou 
hast hotly pursued after me? 
37Whereas thou hast felt about all my 
stuff, what hast thou found of all thy 
household stuff? Set it here before my 
brethren and thy brethren, that they 
may judge betwixt us two. 38These 
twenty years have I been with thee; thy 
ewes and thy she-goats have not cast 
their young, and the rams of thy flocks 
have I not eaten. 39That which was torn 
of beasts I brought not unto thee; I 
bore the loss of it; of my hand didst 
thou require it, whether stolen by day 
or stolen by night. 40Thus I was: in the 
day the drought consumed me, and the 
frost by night; and my sleep fled from 
mine eyes. 41These twenty years have I 
been in thy house: I served thee 
fourteen years for thy two daughters, 
and six years for thy flock; and thou 
hast changed my wages ten times. 
42Except the God of my father, the 
God of Abraham, and the Fear of 
Isaac, had been on my side, surely now 
hadst thou sent me away empty. God 
hath seen mine affliction and the 
labour of my hands, and gave 
judgment yesternight.’ 43And Laban 
answered and said unto Jacob: ‘The 
daughters are my daughters, and the 
children are my children, and the 
flocks are my flocks, and all that thou 
seest is mine; and what can I do this 
day for these my daughters, or for their 
children whom they have borne? 
44And now come, let us make a 
covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a 
witness between me and thee.’ 45And 
Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a 
pillar. 46And Jacob said unto his 
brethren: ‘Gather stones’; and they 
took stones, and made a heap. And 
they did eat there by the heap. 47And 
Laban called it aJegar-sahadutha; but 
Jacob called it bGaleed. 48And Laban 
said: ‘This heap is witness between me 
and thee this day.’ Therefore was the 
name of it called Galeed; 49and 
cMizpah, for he said: ‘The LORD watch 
between me and thee, when we are 
absent one from another. 50If thou shalt 
afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt 
take wives beside my daughters, no 
man being with us; see, God is witness 
betwixt me and thee.’ 51And Laban 
said to Jacob: ‘Behold this heap, and 
behold the pillar, which I have set up 
betwixt me and thee. 52This heap be 
witness, and the pillar be witness, that 

a That is, The heap of witness in 
Aramaic. 

b That is, The heap of witness in 
Hebrew. 

c That is, The watch-post. 


I will not pass over this heap to thee, 
and that thou shalt not pass over this 
heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 
53The God of Abraham, and the God of 
Nahor, the God of their father, judge 
betwixt us.’ And Jacob swore by the 
Fear of his father Isaac. 54And Jacob 
offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and 
called his brethren to eat bread; and 
they did eat bread, and tarried all night 
in the mountain. 

And early in the morning 
Laban rose up, and kissed his 
sons and his daughters, and blessed 
them. And Laban departed, and 
returned unto his place. 2And Jacob 
went on his way, and the angels of 
God met him. 3And Jacob said when 
he saw them: ‘This is God’s camp.’ 
And he called the name of that place 
aMahanaim. 

a That is, Two Camps. 


4And Jacob sent messengers before 
him to Esau his brother unto the land 
of Seir, the field of Edom. 5And he 
commanded them, saying: ‘Thus shall 
ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith 
thy servant Jacob: I have sojourned 
with Laban, and stayed until now. 
6And I have oxen, and asses and 
flocks, and men-servants and maid-
servants; and I have sent to tell my 
lord, that I may find favour in thy 
sight.’ 7And the messengers returned 
to Jacob, saying: ‘We came to thy 
brother Esau, and moreover he cometh 
to meet thee, and four hundred men 

with him.’ 8Then Jacob was greatly 
afraid and was distressed. And he 
divided the people that was with him, 
and the flocks, and the herds, and the 
camels, into two camps. 9And he said: 
‘If Esau come to the one camp, and 
smite it, then the camp which is left 
shall escape.’ 10And Jacob said: ‘O 
God of my father Abraham, and God 
of my father Isaac, O LORD, who saidst 
unto me: Return unto thy country, and 
to thy kindred, and I will do thee good; 
11I am not worthy of all the mercies, 
and of all the truth, which Thou hast 
shown unto Thy servant; for with my 
staff I passed over this Jordan; and 
now I am become two camps. 
12Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the 
hand of my brother, from the hand of 
Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and 
smite me, the mother with the 
children. 13And Thou saidst: I will 
surely do thee good, and make thy 
seed as the sand of the sea, which 
cannot be numbered for multitude.’ 
14And he lodged there that night; and 
took of that which he had with him a 
present for Esau his brother: 15two 
hundred she-goats and twenty he-
goats, two hundred ewes and twenty 
rams, 16thirty milch camels and their 
colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty 
she-asses and ten foals. 17And he 
delivered them into the hand of his 
servants, every drove by itself; and 
said unto his servants: ‘Pass over 
before me, and put a space betwixt 
drove and drove.’ 18And he 
commanded the foremost, saying: 
32 




‘When Esau my brother meeteth thee, 
and asketh thee, saying: Whose art 
thou? and whither goest thou? and 
whose are these before thee? 19then 
thou shalt say: They are thy servant 
Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my 
lord, even unto Esau; and, behold, he 
also is behind us.’ 20And he 
commanded also the second, and the 
third, and all that followed the droves, 
saying: ‘In this manner shall ye speak 
unto Esau, when ye find him; 21and ye 
shall say: Moreover, behold, thy 
servant Jacob is behind us.’ For he 
said: ‘I will appease him with the 
present that goeth before me, and 
afterward I will see his face; 
peradventure he will accept me.’ 22So 
the present passed over before him; 
and he himself lodged that night in the 
camp. 

23And he rose up that night, and 
took his two wives, and his two 
handmaids, and his eleven children, 
and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. 
24And he took them, and sent them 
over the stream, and sent over that 
which he had. 25And Jacob was left 
alone; and there wrestled a man with 
him until the breaking of the day. 
26And when he saw that he prevailed 
not against him, he touched the hollow 
of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s 
thigh was strained, as he wrestled with 
him. 27And he said: ‘Let me go, for the 
day breaketh.’ And he said: ‘I will not 
let thee go, except thou bless me.’ 
28And he said unto him: ‘What is thy 
name?’ And be said: ‘Jacob.’ 29And he 
said: ‘Thy name shall be called no 
more Jacob, but aIsrael; for thou hast 
striven with God and with men, and 
hast prevailed.’ 30And Jacob asked 
him, and said: ‘Tell me, I pray thee, 
thy name.’ And he said: ‘Wherefore is 
it that thou dost ask after my name?’ 
And he blessed him there. 31And Jacob 
called the name of the place bPeniel: 
‘for I have seen God face to face, and 
my life is preserved.’ 32And the sun 
rose upon him as he passed over 
cPeniel, and he limped upon his thigh. 
33Therefore the children of Israel eat 
not the sinew of the thigh-vein which 
is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto 
this day; because he touched the 
hollow of Jacob’s thigh, even in the 
sinew of the thigh-vein. 

a That is, He who striveth with God. 

b That is, The face of God. 

c Heb. Penuel. 

 

33 



And Jacob lifted up his eyes 
and looked, and, behold, Esau 
came, and with him four hundred men. 
And he divided the children unto Leah, 
and unto Rachel, and unto the two 
handmaids. 2And he put the handmaids 
and their children foremost, and Leah 
and her children after, and Rachel and 
Joseph hindermost. 3And he himself 
passed over before them, and bowed 
himself to the ground seven times, 
until he came near to his brother. 4And 
Esau ran to meet him, and embraced 
him, and fell on his neck, and kissed 
him; and they wept. 5And he lifted up 


his eyes, and saw the women and the 
children; and said: ‘Who are these 
with thee?’ And he said: ‘The children 
whom God hath graciously given thy 
servant.’ 6Then the handmaids came 
near, they and their children, and they 
bowed down. 7And Leah also and her 
children came near, and bowed down; 
and after came Joseph near and 
Rachel, and they bowed down. 8And 
he said: ‘What meanest thou by all this 
camp which I met?’ And he said: ‘To 
find favour in the sight of my lord.’ 
9And Esau said: ‘I have enough; my 
brother, let that which thou hast be 
thine.’ 10And Jacob said: ‘Nay, I pray 
thee, if now I have found favour in thy 
sight, then receive my present at my 
hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy 
face, as one seeth the face of God, and 
thou wast pleased with me. 11Take, I 
pray thee, my gift that is brought to 
thee; because God hath dealt 
graciously with me, and because I 
have enough.’ And he urged him, and 
he took it. 12And he said: ‘Let us take 
our journey, and let us go, and I will 
go before thee.’ 13And he said unto 
him: ‘My lord knoweth that the 
children are tender, and that the flocks 
and herds giving suck are a care to me; 
and if they overdrive them one day, all 
the flocks will die. 14Let my lord, I 
pray thee, pass over before his servant; 
and I will journey on gently, according 
to the pace of the cattle that are before 
me and according to the pace of the 
children, until I come unto my lord 
unto Seir.’ 15And Esau said: ‘Let me 
now leave with thee some of the folk 
that are with me.’ And he said: ‘What 
needeth it? let me find favour in the 
sight of my lord.’ 16So Esau returned 
that day on his way unto Seir. 17And 
Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built 
him a house, and made booths for his 
cattle. Therefore the name of the place 
is called aSuccoth. 

a That is, Booths. 

b That is, God, the God of Israel. 

18And Jacob came in peace to the 
city of Shechem, which is in the land 
of Canaan, when he came from 
Paddan-aram; and encamped before 
the city. 19And he bought the parcel of 
ground, where he had spread his tent, 
at the hand of the children of Hamor, 
Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces 
of money. 20And he erected there an 
altar, and called it bEl-elohe-Israel. 

34 



And Dinah the daughter of 
Leah, whom she had borne 
unto Jacob, went out to see the 
daughters of the land. 2And Shechem 
the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince 
of the land, saw her; and he took her, 
and lay with her, and humbled her. 
3And his soul did cleave unto Dinah 
the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the 
damsel, and spoke comfortingly unto 
the damsel. 4And Shechem spoke unto 
his father Hamor, saying: ‘Get me this 
damsel to wife.’ 5Now Jacob heard 
that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; 
and his sons were with his cattle in the 
field; and Jacob held his peace until 
they came. 6And Hamor the father of 


Shechem went out unto Jacob to speak 
with him. 7And the sons of Jacob came 
in from the field when they heard it; 
and the men were grieved, and they 
were very wroth, because he had 
wrought a vile deed in Israel in lying 
with Jacob’s daughter; which thing 
ought not to be done. 8And Hamor 
spoke with them, saying ‘The soul of 
my son Shechem longeth for your 
daughter. I pray you give her unto him 
to wife. 9And make ye marriages with 
us; give your daughters unto us, and 
take our daughters unto you. 10And ye 
shall dwell with us; and the land shall 
be before you; dwell and trade ye 
therein, and get you possessions 
therein.’ 11And Shechem said unto her 
father and unto her brethren: ‘Let me 
find favour in your eyes, and what ye 
shall say unto me I will give. 12Ask me 
never so much dowry and gift, and I 
will give according as ye shall say 
unto me; but give me the damsel to 
wife.’ 13And the sons of Jacob 
answered Shechem and Hamor his 
father with guile, and spoke, because 
he had defiled Dinah their sister, 14and 
said unto them: ‘We cannot do this 
thing, to give our sister to one that is 
uncircumcised; for that were a 
reproach unto us. 15Only on this 
condition will we consent unto you: if 
ye will be as we are, that every male of 
you be circumcised; 16then will we 
give our daughters unto you, and we 
will take your daughters to us, and we 
will dwell with you, and we will 
become one people. 17But if ye will not 
hearken unto us, to be circumcised; 
then will we take our daughter, and we 
will be gone.’ 18And their words 
pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s 
son. 19And the young man deferred not 
to do the thing, because he had delight 
in Jacob’s daughter. And he was 
honoured above all the house of his 
father. 20And Hamor and Shechem his 
son came unto the gate of their city, 
and spoke with the men of their city, 
saying: 21’These men are peaceable 
with us; therefore let them dwell in the 
land, and trade therein; for, behold, the 
land is large enough for them; let us 
take their daughters to us for wives, 
and let us give them our daughters. 
22Only on this condition will the men 
consent unto us to dwell with us, to 
become one people, if every male 
among us be circumcised, as they are 
circumcised. 23Shall not their cattle 
and their substance and all their beasts 
be ours? only let us consent unto them, 
and they will dwell with us.’ 24And 
unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son 
hearkened all that went out of the gate 
of his city; and every male was 
circumcised, all that went out of the 
gate of his city. 25And it came to pass 
on the third day, when they were in 
pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, 
Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, 
took each man his sword, and came 
upon the city unawares, and slew all 
the males. 26And they slew Hamor and 
Shechem his son with the edge of the 
sword, and took Dinah out of 
Shechem’s house, and went forth. 


27The sons of Jacob came upon the 
slain, and spoiled the city, because 
they had defiled their sister. 28They 
took their flocks and their herds and 
their asses, and that which was in the 
city and that which was in the field; 
29and all their wealth, and all their little 
ones and their wives, took they captive 
and spoiled, even all that was in the 
house. 30And Jacob said to Simeon and 
Levi: ‘Ye have troubled me, to make 
me odious unto the inhabitants of the 
land, even unto the Canaanites and the 
Perizzites; and, I being few in number, 
they will gather themselves together 
against me and smite me; and I shall 
be destroyed, I and my house.’ 31And 
they said: ‘Should one deal with our 
sister as with a harlot?’ 

35 



And God said unto Jacob: 
‘Arise, go up to Beth-el, and 
dwell there; and make there an altar 
unto God, who appeared unto thee 
when thou didst flee from the face of 
Esau thy brother.’ 2Then Jacob said 
unto his household, and to all that 
were with him: ‘Put away the strange 
gods that are among you, and purify 
yourselves, and change your garments; 
3and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; 
and I will make there an altar unto 
God, who answered me in the day of 
my distress, and was with me in the 
way which I went.’ 4And they gave 
unto Jacob all the foreign gods which 
were in their hand, and the rings which 
were in their ears; and Jacob hid them 
under the terebinth which was by 
Shechem. 5And they journeyed; and a 
terror of God was upon the cities that 
were round about them, and they did 
not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 6So 
Jacob came to Luz, which is in the 
land of Canaan—the same is Beth-el—
he and all the people that were with 
him. 7And he built there an altar, and 
called the place aEl-beth-el, because 
there God was revealed unto him, 
when he fled from the face of his 
brother. 8And Deborah Rebekah’s 
nurse died, and she was buried below 
Beth-el under the oak; and the name of 
it was called bAllon-bacuth. 

a That is, The God of Beth-el. 

b That is, The oak of weeping. 

9And God appeared unto Jacob 
again, when he came from Paddan-
aram, and blessed him. 10And God said 
unto him: ‘Thy name is Jacob: thy 
name shall not be called any more 
Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name’; 
and He called his name Israel. 11And 
God said unto him: ‘I am God 
Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a 
nation and a company of nations shall 
be of thee, and kings shall come out of 
thy loins; 12and the land which I gave 
unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will 
give it, and to thy seed after thee will I 
give the land.’ 13And God went up 
from him in the place where He spoke 
with him. 14And Jacob set up a pillar in 
the place where He spoke with him, a 
pillar of stone, and he poured out a 
drink-offering thereon, and poured oil 
thereon. 15And Jacob called the name 
of the place where God spoke with 


him, Beth-el. 16And they journeyed 
from Beth-el; and there was still some 
way to come to Ephrath; and Rachel 
travailed, and she had hard labour. 
17And it came to pass, when she was in 
hard labour, that the mid-wife said 
unto her: ‘Fear not; for this also is a 
son for thee.’ 18And it came to pass, as 
her soul was in departing—for she 
died—that she called his name aBen-
oni; but his father called him 
bBenjamin. 19And Rachel died, and 
was buried in the way to Ephrath—the 
same is Beth-lehem. 20And Jacob set 
up a pillar upon her grave; the same is 
the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this 
day. 21And Israel journeyed, and 
spread his tent beyond Migdal-eder. 
22And it came to pass, while Israel 
dwelt in that land, that Reuben went 
and lay with Bilhah his father’s 
concubine; and Israel heard of it. 

a That is, The son of my sorrow. 

b That is, The son of the right hand. 

Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
23the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s 
first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and 
Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun; 
24the sons of Rachel: Joseph and 
Benjamin; 25and the sons of Bilhah, 
Rachel’s handmaid: Dan and Naphtali; 
26and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s 
handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are 
the sons of Jacob, that were born to 
him in Paddan-aram. 27And Jacob 
came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, 
to Kiriatharba—the same is Hebron—
where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. 

28And the days of Isaac were a 
hundred and fourscore years. 29And 
Isaac expired, and died, and was 
gathered unto his people, old and full 
of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons 
buried him. 

36 



Now these are the generations 
of Esau—the same is Edom. 
2Esau took his wives of the daughters 
of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon 
the Hittite, and Oholibamah the 
daughter of Anah, the daughter of 
Zibeon the Hivite, 3and Basemath 
Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 
4And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; and 
Basemath bore Reuel; 5and 
Oholibamah bore Jeush, and Jalam, 
and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, 
that were born unto him in the land of 
Canaan. 6And Esau took his wives, and 
his sons, and his daughters, and all the 
souls of his house, and his cattle, and 
all his beasts, and all his possessions, 
which he had gathered in the land of 
Canaan; and went into a land away 
from his brother Jacob. 7For their 
substance was too great for them to 
dwell together; and the land of their 
sojournings could not bear them 
because of their cattle. 8And Esau 
dwelt in the mountain-land of Seir—
Esau is Edom. 9And these are the 
generations of Esau the father of a cthe 
Edomites in the mountain-land of Seir. 
10These are the names of Esau’s sons: 
Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of 
Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the 

c Heb. Edom. 


wife of Esau. 11And the sons of 
Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, 
and Gatam, and Kenaz. 12And Timna 
was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son; 
and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These 
are the sons of Adah Esau’s wife. 
13And these are the sons of Reuel: 
Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and 
Mizzah. These were the sons of 
Basemath Esau’s wife. 14And these 
were the sons of Oholibamah the 
daughter of Anah, the daughter of 
Zibeon, Esau’s wife; and she bore to 
Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. 
15These are the chiefs of the sons of 
Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born 
of Esau: the chief of Teman, the chief 
of Omar, the chief of Zepho, the chief 
of Kenaz, 16the chief of Korah, the 
chief of Gatam, the chief of Amalek. 
These are the chiefs that came of 
Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These are 
the sons of Adah. 17And these are the 
sons of Reuel Esau’s son: the chief of 
Nahath, the chief of Zerah, the chief of 
Shammah, the chief of Mizzah. These 
are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the 
land of Edom. These are the sons of 
Basemath Esau’s wife. 18And these are 
the sons of Oholibamah Esau’s wife: 
the chief of Jeush, the chief of Jalam, 
the chief of Korah. These are the 
chiefs that came of Oholibamah the 
daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife. 
19These are the sons of Esau, and these 
are their chiefs; the same is Edom. 

20These are the sons of Seir the 
Horite, the inhabitants of the land: 
Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and 
Anah, 21and Dishon and Ezer and 
Dishan. These are the chiefs that came 
of the Horites, the children of Seir in 
the land of Edom. 22And the children 
of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and 
Lotan’s sister was Timna. 23And these 
are the children of Shobal: Alvan and 
Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and 
Onam. 24And these are the children of 
Zibeon: Aiah and Anah—this is Anah 
who found the hot springs in the 
wilderness, as he fed the asses of 
Zibeon his father. 25And these are the 
children of Anah: Dishon and 
Oholibamah the daughter of Anah. 
26And these are the children of 
aDishon: Hemdan and Eshban and 
Ithran and Cheran. 27These are the 
children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan 
and Akan. 28These are the children of 
Dishan: Uz and Aran. 29These are the 
chiefs that came of the Horites: the 
chief of Lotan, the chief of Shobal, the 
chief of Zibeon, the chief of Anah, 
30the chief of Dishon, the chief of 
Ezer, the chief of Dishan. These are 
the chiefs that came of the Horites, 
according to their chiefs in the land of 
Seir. 

a Heb. Dishan. 

31And these are the kings that 
reigned in the land of Edom, before 
there reigned any king over the 
children of Israel. 32And Bela the son 
of Beor reigned in Edom; and the 
name of his city was Dinhabah. 33And 
Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah 
of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 34And 


Jobab died, and Husham of the land of 
the Temanites reigned in his stead. 
35And Husham died, and Hadad the 
son of Bedad, who smote Midian in 
the field of Moab, reigned in his stead; 
and the name of his city was Avith. 
36And Hadad died, and Samlah of 
Masrekah reigned in his stead. 37And 
Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth 
by the River reigned in his stead. 
38And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the 
son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 
39And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor 
died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; 
and the name of the city was Pau; and 
his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the 
daughter of Matred, the daughter of 
Me-zahab. 40And these are the names 
of the chiefs that came of Esau, 
according to their families, after their 
places, by their names: the chief of 
Timna, the chief of Alvah, the chief of 
Jetheth; 41the chief of Oholibamah, the 
chief of Elah, the chief of Pinon; 42the 
chief of Kenaz, the chief of Teman, the 
chief of Mibzar; 43the chief of 
Magdiel, the chief of Iram. These are 
the chiefs of Edom, according to their 
habitations in the land of their 
possession. This is Esau the father of 
the Edomites. 


And Jacob dwelt in the land of 
his father’s sojournings, in the 
land of Canaan. 2These are the 
generations of Jacob. Joseph, being 
seventeen years old, was feeding the 
flock with his brethren, being still a 
lad even with the sons of Bilhah, and 
with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s 
wives; and Joseph brought evil report 
of them unto their father. 3Now Israel 
loved Joseph more than all his 
children, because he was the son of his 
old age; and he made him a coat of 
many colours. 4And when his brethren 
saw that their father loved him more 
than all his brethren, they hated him, 
and could not speak peaceably unto 
him. 5And Joseph dreamed a dream, 
and he told it to his brethren; and they 
hated him yet the more. 6And he said 
unto them: ‘Hear, I pray you, this 
dream which I have dreamed: 7for, 
behold, we were binding sheaves in 
the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and 
also stood upright; and, behold, your 
sheaves came round about, and bowed 
down to my sheaf.’ 8And his brethren 
said to him: ‘Shalt thou indeed reign 
over us? or shalt thou indeed have 
dominion over us?’ And they hated 
him yet the more for his dreams, and 
for his words. 9And he dreamed yet 
another dream, and told it to his 
brethren, and said: ‘Behold, I have 
dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the 
sun and the moon and eleven stars 
bowed down to me.’ 10And he told it to 
his father, and to his brethren; and his 
father rebuked him, and said unto him: 
‘What is this dream that thou hast 
dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and 
thy brethren indeed come to bow down 
to thee to the earth?’ 11And his 
brethren envied him; but his father 
kept the saying in mind. 
37 




12And his brethren went to feed their 
father’s flock in Shechem. 13And Israel 
said unto Joseph: ‘Do not thy brethren 
feed the flock in Shechem? come, and 
I will send thee unto them.’ And he 
said to him: ‘Here am I.’ 14And he said 
to him: ‘Go now, see whether it is well 
with thy brethren, and well with the 
flock; and bring me back word.’ So he 
sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and 
he came to Shechem. 15And a certain 
man found him, and, behold, he was 
wandering in the field. And the man 
asked him, saying: ‘What seekest 
thou?’ 16And he said: ‘I seek my 
brethren. Tell me, I pray thee, where 
they are feeding the flock.’ 17And the 
man said: ‘They are departed hence; 
for I heard them say: Let us go to 
Dothan.’ And Joseph went after his 
brethren, and found them in Dothan. 
18And they saw him afar off, and 
before he came near unto them, they 
conspired against him to slay him. 
19And they said one to another: 
‘Behold, this dreamer cometh. 20Come 
now therefore, and let us slay him, and 
cast him into one of the pits, and we 
will say: An evil beast hath devoured 
him; and we shall see what will 
become of his dreams.’ 21And Reuben 
heard it, and delivered him out of their 
hand; and said: ‘Let us not take his 
life.’ 22And Reuben said unto them: 
‘Shed no blood; cast him into this pit 
that is in the wilderness, but lay no 
hand upon him’—that he might deliver 
him out of their hand, to restore him to 
his father. 23And it came to pass, when 
Joseph was come unto his brethren, 
that they stripped Joseph of his coat, 
the coat of many colours that was on 
him; 24and they took him, and cast him 
into the pit—and the pit was empty, 
there was no water in it. 25And they sat 
down to eat bread; and they lifted up 
their eyes and looked, and, behold, a 
caravan of Ishmaelites came from 
Gilead, with their camels bearing 
spicery and balm and ladanum, going 
to carry it down to Egypt. 26And Judah 
said unto his brethren: ‘What profit is 
it if we slay our brother and conceal 
his blood? 27Come, and let us sell him 
to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand 
be upon him; for he is our brother, our 
flesh.’ And his brethren hearkened 
unto him. 28And there passed by 
Midianites, merchantmen; and they 
drew and lifted up Joseph out of the 
pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites 
for twenty shekels of silver. And they 
brought Joseph into Egypt. 29And 
Reuben returned unto the pit; and, 
behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and 
he rent his clothes. 30And he returned 
unto his brethren, and said: ‘The child 
is not; and as for me, whither shall I 
go?’ 31And they took Joseph’s coat, 
and killed a he-goat, and dipped the 
coat in the blood; 32and they sent the 
coat of many colours, and they brought 
it to their father; and said: ‘This have 
we found. Know now whether it is thy 
son’s coat or not.’ 33And he knew it, 
and said: ‘It is my son’s coat; an evil 
beast hath devoured him; Joseph is 
without doubt torn in pieces.’ 34And 


Jacob rent his garments, and put 
sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned 
for his son many days. 35And all his 
sons and all his daughters rose up to 
comfort him; but he refused to be 
comforted; and he said: ‘Nay, but I 
will go down to the grave to my son 
mourning.’ And his father wept for 
him. 36And the aMidianites sold him 
into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of 
Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard. 

a Heb. Medanites. 

And it came to pass at that 
time, that Judah went down 
from his brethren, and turned in to a 
certain Adullamite, whose name was 
Hirah. 2And Judah saw there a 
daughter of a certain Canaanite whose 
name was Shua; and he took her, and 
went in unto her. 3And she conceived, 
and bore a son; and he called his name 
Er. 4And she conceived again, and 
bore a son; and she called his name 
Onan. 5And she yet again bore a son, 
and called his name Shelah; and he 
was at Chezib, when she bore him. 
6And Judah took a wife for Er his first-
born, and her name was Tamar. 7And 
Er, Judah’s first-born, was wicked in 
the sight of the LORD; and the LORD 
slew him. 8And Judah said unto Onan: 
‘Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and 
perform the duty of a husband’s 
brother unto her, and raise up seed to 
thy brother.’ 9And Onan knew that the 
seed would not be his; and it came to 
pass when he went in unto his 
brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the 

ground, lest he should give seed to his 
brother. 10And the thing which he did 
was evil in the sight of the LORD; and 
He slew him also. 11Then said Judah to 
Tamar his daughter-in-law: ‘Remain a 
widow in thy father’s house, till 
Shelah my son be grown up’; for he 
said: ‘Lest he also die, like his 
brethren.’ And Tamar went and dwelt 
in her father’s house. 12And in process 
of time Shua’s daughter, the wife of 
Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, 
and went up unto his sheep-shearers to 
Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the 
Adullamite. 13And it was told Tamar, 
saying: ‘Behold, thy father-in-law 
goeth up to Timnah to shear his 
sheep.’ 14And she put off from her the 
garments of her widowhood, and 
covered herself with her veil, and 
wrapped herself, and sat in the 
entrance of Enaim, which is by the 
way to Timnah; for she saw that 
Shelah was grown up, and she was not 
given unto him to wife. 15When Judah 
saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; 
for she had covered her face. 16And he 
turned unto her by the way, and said: 
‘Come, I pray thee, let me come in 
unto thee’; for he knew not that she 
was his daughter-in-law. And she said: 
‘What wilt thou give me, that thou 
mayest come in unto me?’ 17And he 
said: ‘I will send thee a kid of the 
goats from the flock.’ And she said: 
‘Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou 
send it?’ 18And he said: ‘What pledge 
shall I give thee?’ And she said: ‘Thy 
signet and thy cord, and thy staff that 
38 




is in thy hand.’ And he gave them to 
her, and came in unto her, and she 
conceived by him. 19And she arose, 
and went away, and put off her veil 
from her, and put on the garments of 
her widowhood. 20And Judah sent the 
kid of the goats by the hand of his 
friend the Adullamite, to receive the 
pledge from the woman’s hand; but he 
found her not. 21Then he asked the 
men of her place, saying: ‘Where is 
the harlot, that was at Enaim by the 
wayside?’ And they said: ‘There hath 
been no harlot here.’ 22And he returned 
to Judah, and said: ‘I have not found 
her; and also the men of the place said: 
There hath been no harlot here.’ 23And 
Judah said: ‘Let her take it, lest we be 
put to shame; behold, I sent this kid, 
and thou hast not found her.’ 24And it 
came to pass about three months after, 
that it was told Judah, saying: ‘Tamar 
thy daughter-in-law hath played the 
harlot; and moreover, behold, she is 
with child by harlotry.’ And Judah 
said: ‘Bring her forth, and let her be 
burnt.’ 25When she was brought forth, 
she sent to her father-in-law, saying: 
‘By the man, whose these are, am I 
with child’; and she said: ‘Discern, I 
pray thee, whose are these, the signet, 
and the cords, and the staff.’ 26And 
Judah acknowledged them, and said: 
‘She is more righteous than I; 
forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah 
my son.’ And he knew her again no 
more. 27And it came to pass in the time 
of her travail, that, behold, twins were 
in her womb. 28And it came to pass, 
when she travailed, that one put out a 
hand; and the midwife took and bound 
upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying: 
‘This came out first.’ 29And it came to 
pass, as he drew back his hand, that, 
behold his brother came out; and she 
said: ‘Wherefore hast thou made a 
breach for thyself?’ Therefore his 
name was called aPerez. 30And 
afterward came out his brother, that 
had the scarlet thread upon his hand; 
and his name was called Zerah. 

a That is, A breach. 

39 



And Joseph was brought down 
to Egypt; and Potiphar, an 
officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the 
guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the 
hand of the Ishmaelites, that had 
brought him down thither. 2And the 
LORD was with Joseph, and he was a 
prosperous man; and he was in the 
house of his master the Egyptian. 3And 
his master saw that the LORD was with 
him, and that the LORD made all that he 
did to prosper in his hand. 4And Joseph 
found favour in his sight, and he 
ministered unto him. And he appointed 
him overseer over his house, and all 
that he had he put into his hand. 5And 
it came to pass from the time that he 
appointed him overseer in his house, 
and over all that he had, that the LORD 
blessed the Egyptian’s house for 
Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the 
LORD was upon all that he had, in the 
house and in the field. 6And he left all 
that he had in Joseph’s hand; and, 
having him, he knew not aught save 


the bread which he did eat. And 
Joseph was of beautiful form, and fair 
to look upon. 

7And it came to pass after these 
things, that his master’s wife cast her 
eyes upon Joseph; and she said: ‘Lie 
with me.’ 8But he refused, and said 
unto his master’s wife: ‘Behold, my 
master, having me, knoweth not what 
is in the house, and he hath put all that 
he hath into my hand; 9he is not greater 
in this house than I; neither hath he 
kept back any thing from me but thee, 
because thou art his wife. How then 
can I do this great wickedness, and sin 
against God?’ 10And it came to pass, as 
she spoke to Joseph day by day, that 
he hearkened not unto her, to lie by 
her, or to be with her. 11And it came to 
pass on a certain day, when he went 
into the house to do his work, and 
there was none of the men of the house 
there within, 12that she caught him by 
his garment, saying: ‘Lie with me.’ 
And he left his garment in her hand, 
and fled, and got him out. 13And it 
came to pass, when she saw that he 
had left his garment in her hand, and 
was fled forth, 14that she called unto 
the men of her house, and spoke unto 
them, saying: ‘See, he hath brought in 
a Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came 
in unto me to lie with me, and I cried 
with a loud voice. 15And it came to 
pass, when he heard that I lifted up my 
voice and cried, that he left his 
garment by me, and fled, and got him 
out.’ 16And she laid up his garment by 
her, until his master came home. 17And 
she spoke unto him according to these 
words, saying: ‘The Hebrew servant, 
whom thou hast brought unto us, came 
in unto me to mock me. 18And it came 
to pass, as I lifted up my voice and 
cried, that he left his garment by me, 
and fled out.’ 19And it came to pass, 
when his master heard the words of his 
wife, which she spoke unto him, 
saying: ‘After this manner did thy 
servant to me’; that his wrath was 
kindled. 20And Joseph’s master took 
him, and put him into the prison, the 
place where the king’s prisoners were 
bound; and he was there in the prison. 
21But the LORD was with Joseph, and 
showed kindness unto him, and gave 
him favour in the sight of the keeper of 
the prison. 22And the keeper of the 
prison committed to Joseph’s hand all 
the prisoners that were in the prison; 
and whatsoever they did there, he was 
the doer of it. 23The keeper of the 
prison looked not to any thing that was 
under his hand, because the LORD was 
with him; and that which he did, the 
LORD made it to prosper. 

And it came to pass after these 
things, that the butler of the 
king of Egypt and his baker offended 
their lord the king of Egypt. 2And 
Pharaoh was wroth against his two 
officers, against the chief of the 
butlers, and against the chief of the 
bakers. 3And he put them in ward in 
the house of the captain of the guard, 
into the prison, the place where Joseph 
was bound. 4And the captain of the 
guard charged Joseph to be with them, 
40 




and he ministered unto them; and they 
continued a season in ward. 5And they 
dreamed a dream both of them, each 
man his dream, in one night, each man 
according to the interpretation of his 
dream, the butler and the baker of the 
king of Egypt, who were bound in the 
prison. 6And Joseph came in unto them 
in the morning, and saw them, and, 
behold, they were sad. 7And he asked 
Pharaoh’s officers that were with him 
in the ward of his master’s house, 
saying: ‘Wherefore look ye so sad to-
day?’ 8And they said unto him: ‘We 
have dreamed a dream, and there is 
none that can interpret it.’ And Joseph 
said unto them: ‘Do not interpretations 
belong to God? tell it me, I pray you.’ 
9And the chief butler told his dream to 
Joseph, and said to him: ‘In my dream, 
behold, a vine was before me; 10and in 
the vine were three branches; and as it 
was budding, its blossoms shot forth, 
and the clusters thereof brought forth 
ripe grapes, 11and Pharaoh’s cup was 
in my hand; and I took the grapes, and 
pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I 
gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.’ 
12And Joseph said unto him: ‘This is 
the interpretation of it: the three 
branches are three days; 13within yet 
three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy 
head, and restore thee unto thine 
office; and thou shalt give Pharaoh’s 
cup into his hand, after the former 
manner when thou wast his butler. 
14But have me in thy remembrance 
when it shall be well with thee, and 
show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, 
and make mention of me unto 
Pharaoh, and bring me out of this 
house. 15For indeed I was stolen away 
out of the land of the Hebrews; and 
here also have I done nothing that they 
should put me into the dungeon.’ 
16When the chief baker saw that the 
interpretation was good, he said unto 
Joseph: ‘I also saw in my dream, and, 
behold, three baskets of white bread 
were on my head; 17and in the 
uppermost basket there was of all 
manner of baked food for Pharaoh; 
and the birds did eat them out of the 
basket upon my head.’ 18And Joseph 
answered and said: ‘This is the 
interpretation thereof: the three baskets 
are three days; 19within yet three days 
shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off 
thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and 
the birds shall eat thy flesh from off 
thee.’ 20And it came to pass the third 
day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, 
that he made a feast unto all his 
servants; and he lifted up the head of 
the chief butler and the head of the 
chief baker among his servants. 21And 
he restored the chief butler back unto 
his butlership; and he gave the cup into 
Pharaoh’s hand. 22But he hanged the 
chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted 
to them. 23Yet did not the chief butler 
remember Joseph, but forgot him. 

 


And it came to pass at the end 
of two full years, that Pharaoh 41 




dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the 
ariver. 2And, behold, there came up out 
of the river seven kine, well-favoured 
and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the 
reed-grass. 3And, behold, seven other 
kine came up after them out of the 
river, ill favoured and lean-fleshed; 
and stood by the other kine upon the 
brink of the river. 4And the ill-
favoured and lean-fleshed kine did eat 
up the seven well-favoured and fat 
kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 5And he slept 
and dreamed a second time: and, 
behold, seven ears of corn came up 
upon one stalk, rank and good. 6And, 
behold, seven ears, thin and blasted 
with the east wind, sprung up after 
them. 7And the thin ears swallowed up 
the seven rank and full ears. And 
Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a 
dream. 8And it came to pass in the 
morning that his spirit was troubled; 
and he sent and called for all the 
magicians of Egypt, and all the wise 
men thereof; and Pharaoh told them 
his dream; but there was none that 
could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 
9Then spoke the chief butler unto 
Pharaoh, saying: ‘I make mention of 
my faults this day: 10Pharaoh was 
wroth with his servants, and put me in 
the ward of the house of the captain of 
the guard, me and the chief baker. 
11And we dreamed a dream in one 
night, I and he; we dreamed each man 
according to the interpretation of his 
dream. 12And there was with us there a 

a That is, the Nile. 

young man, a Hebrew, servant to the 
captain of the guard; and we told him, 
and he interpreted to us our dreams; to 
each man according to his dream he 
did interpret. 13And it came to pass, as 
he interpreted to us, so it was: I was 
restored unto mine office, and he was 
hanged.’ 14Then Pharaoh sent and 
called Joseph, and they brought him 
hastily out of the dungeon. And he 
shaved himself, and changed his 
raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 
15And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: ‘I 
have dreamed a dream, and there is 
none that can interpret it; and I have 
heard say of thee, that when thou 
hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.’ 
16And Joseph answered Pharaoh, 
saying: ‘It is not in me; God will give 
Pharaoh an answer of peace.’ 17And 
Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph: ‘In my 
dream, behold, I stood upon the brink 
of the river. 18And, behold, there came 
up out of the river seven kine, fat-
fleshed and well-favoured; and they 
fed in the reedgrass. 19And, behold, 
seven other kine came up after them, 
poor and very ill-favoured and lean-
fleshed, such as I never saw in all the 
land of Egypt for badness. 20And the 
lean and ill-favoured kine did eat up 
the first seven fat kine. 21And when 
they had eaten them up, it could not be 
known that they had eaten them; but 
they were still ill-favoured as at the 
beginning. So I awoke. 22And I saw in 
my dream, and, behold, seven ears 
came up upon one stalk, full and good. 
23And, behold, seven ears, withered, 


thin, and blasted with the east wind, 
sprung up after them. 24And the thin 
ears swallowed up the seven good 
ears. And I told it unto the magicians; 
but there was none that could declare it 
to me.’ 25And Joseph said unto 
Pharaoh: ‘The dream of Pharaoh is 
one; what God is about to do He hath 
declared unto Pharaoh. 26The seven 
good kine are seven years; and the 
seven good ears are seven years: the 
dream is one. 27And the seven lean and 
ill-favoured kine that came up after 
them are seven years, and also the 
seven empty ears blasted with the east 
wind; they shall be seven years of 
famine. 28That is the thing which I 
spoke unto Pharaoh: what God is 
about to do He hath shown unto 
Pharaoh. 29Behold, there come seven 
years of great plenty throughout all the 
land of Egypt. 30And there shall arise 
after them seven years of famine; and 
all the plenty shall be forgotten in the 
land of Egypt; and the famine shall 
consume the land; 31and the plenty 
shall not be known in the land by 
reason of that famine which followeth; 
for it shall be very grievous. 32And for 
that the dream was doubled unto 
Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing 
is established by God, and God will 
shortly bring it to pass. 33Now 
therefore let Pharaoh look out a man 
discreet and wise, and set him over the 
land of Egypt. 34Let Pharaoh do this, 
and let him appoint overseers over the 
land, and take up the fifth part of the 
land of Egypt in the seven years of 
plenty. 35And let them gather all the 
food of these good years that come, 
and lay up corn under the hand of 
Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let 
them keep it. 36And the food shall be 
for a store to the land against the seven 
years of famine, which shall be in the 
land of Egypt; that the land perish not 
through the famine.’ 37And the thing 
was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and 
in the eyes of all his servants. 38And 
Pharaoh said unto his servants: ‘Can 
we find such a one as this, a man in 
whom the spirit of God is?’ 39And 
Pharaoh said unto Joseph: ‘Forasmuch 
as God hath shown thee all this, there 
is none so discreet and wise as thou. 
40Thou shalt be over my house, and 
according unto thy word shall all my 
people be ruled; only in the throne will 
I be greater than thou.’ 41And Pharaoh 
said unto Joseph: ‘See, I have set thee 
over all the land of Egypt.’ 42And 
Pharaoh took off his signet ring from 
his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s 
hand, and arrayed him in vestures of 
fine linen, and put a gold chain about 
his neck. 43And he made him to ride in 
the second chariot which he had; and 
they cried before him: ‘Abrech’; and 
he set him over all the land of Egypt. 
44And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: ‘I am 
Pharaoh, and without thee shall no 
man lift up his hand or his foot in all 
the land of Egypt.’ 45And Pharaoh 
called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-
paneah; and he gave him to wife 
Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera 
priest of On. And Joseph went out 


over the land of Egypt.— 46And Joseph 
was thirty years old when he stood 
before Pharaoh king of Egypt.—And 
Joseph went out from the presence of 
Pharaoh, and went throughout all the 
land of Egypt. 47And in the seven years 
of plenty the earth brought forth in 
heaps. 48And he gathered up all the 
food of the seven years which were in 
the land of Egypt, and laid up the food 
in the cities; the food of the field, 
which was round about every city, laid 
he up in the same. 49And Joseph laid 
up corn as the sand of the sea, very 
much, until they left off numbering; 
for it was without number. 50And unto 
Joseph were born two sons before the 
year of famine came, whom Asenath 
the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On 
bore unto him. 51And Joseph called the 
name of the first-born aManasseh: ‘for 
God hath made me forget all my toil, 
and all my father’s house.’ 52And the 
name of the second called he 
bEphraim: ‘for God hath made me 
fruitful in the land of my affliction.’ 
53And the seven years of plenty, that 
was in the land of Egypt, came to an 
end. 54And the seven years of famine 
began to come, according as Joseph 
had said; and there was famine in all 
lands; but in all the land of Egypt there 
was bread. 55And when all the land of 
Egypt was famished, the people cried 
to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said 

a That is, Making to forget. 

b From a Hebrew word signifying to 
be fruitful, 

unto all the Egyptians: ‘Go unto 
Joseph; what he saith to you, do.’ 
56And the famine was over all the face 
of the earth; and Joseph opened all the 
storehouses, and sold unto the 
Egyptians; and the famine was sore in 
the land of Egypt. 57And all countries 
came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn; 
because the famine was sore in all the 
earth. 

Now Jacob saw that there was 
corn in Egypt, and Jacob said 
unto his sons: ‘Why do ye look one 
upon another?’ 2And he said: ‘Behold, 
I have heard that there is corn in 
Egypt. Get you down thither, and buy 
for us from thence; that we may live, 
and not die.’ 3And Joseph’s ten 
brethren went down to buy corn from 
Egypt. 4But Benjamin, Joseph’s 
brother, Jacob sent not with his 
brethren; for he said: ‘Lest 
peradventure harm befall him.’ 5And 
the sons of Israel came to buy among 
those that came; for the famine was in 
the land of Caanan. 6And Joseph was 
the governor over the land; he it was 
that sold to all the people of the land. 
And Joseph’s brethren came, and 
bowed down to him with their faces to 
the earth. 7And Joseph saw his 
brethren, and he knew them, but made 
himself strange unto them, and spoke 
roughly with them; and he said unto 
them: ‘Whence come ye?’ And they 
said: ‘From the land of Canaan to buy 
food.’ 8And Joseph knew his brethren, 
but they knew him not. 9And Joseph 
remembered the dreams which he 
42 




dreamed of them, and said unto them: 
‘Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of 
the land ye are come.’ 10And they said 
unto him: ‘Nay, my lord, but to buy 
food are thy servants come. 11We are 
all one man’s sons; we are upright 
men, thy servants are no spies.’ 12And 
he said unto them: ‘Nay, but to see the 
nakedness of the land ye are come.’ 
13And they said: ‘We thy servants are 
twelve brethren, the sons of one man 
in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the 
youngest is this day with our father, 
and one is not.’ 14And Joseph said unto 
them: ‘That is it that I spoke unto you, 
saying: Ye are spies. 15Hereby ye shall 
be proved, as Pharaoh liveth, ye shall 
not go forth hence, except your 
youngest brother come hither. 16Send 
one of you, and let him fetch your 
brother, and ye shall be bound, that 
your words may be proved, whether 
there be truth in you; or else, as 
Pharaoh liveth, surely ye are spies.’ 
17And he put them all together into 
ward three days. 18And Joseph said 
unto them the third day.’ This do, and 
live; for I fear God: 19if ye be upright 
men, let one of your brethren be bound 
in your prison-house; but go ye, carry 
corn for the famine of your houses; 
20and bring your youngest brother unto 
me; so shall your words be verified, 
and ye shall not die.’ And they did so. 
21And they said one to another: ‘We 
are verily guilty concerning our 
brother, in that we saw the distress of 
his soul, when he besought us, and we 
would not hear; therefore is this 
distress come upon us.’ 22And Reuben 
answered them, saying: ‘Spoke I not 
unto you, saying: Do not sin against 
the child; and ye would not hear? 
therefore also, behold, his blood is 
required.’ 23And they knew not that 
Joseph understood them; for the 
interpreter was between them. 24And 
he turned himself about from them, 
and wept; and he returned to them, and 
spoke to them, and took Simeon from 
among them, and bound him before 
their eyes. 25Then Joseph commanded 
to fill their vessels with corn, and to 
restore every man’s money into his 
sack, and to give them provision for 
the way; and thus was it done unto 
them. 26And they laded their asses with 
their corn, and departed thence. 27And 
as one of them opened his sack to give 
his ass provender in the lodging-place, 
he espied his money; and, behold, it 
was in the mouth of his sack. 28And he 
said unto his brethren: ‘My money is 
restored; and, lo, it is even in my 
sack.’ And their heart failed them, and 
they turned trembling one to another, 
saying: ‘What is this that God hath 
done unto us?’ 29And they came unto 
Jacob their father unto the land of 
Canaan, and told him all that had 
befallen them, saying: 30’The man, the 
lord of the land, spoke roughly with 
us, and took us for spies of the 
country. 31And we said unto him: We 
are upright men; we are no spies. 32We 
are twelve brethren, sons of our father; 
one is not, and the youngest is this day 
with our father in the land of Canaan. 


33And the man, the lord of the land, 
said unto us: Hereby shall I know that 
ye are upright men: leave one of your 
brethren with me, and take corn for the 
famine of your houses, and go your 
way. 34And bring your youngest 
brother unto me; then shall I know that 
ye are no spies, but that ye are upright 
men; so will I deliver you your 
brother, and ye shall traffic in the 
land.’ 35And it came to pass as they 
emptied their sacks, that, behold, every 
man’s bundle of money was in his 
sack; and when they and their father 
saw their bundles of money, they were 
afraid. 36And Jacob their father said 
unto them: ‘Me have ye bereaved of 
my children: Joseph is not, and 
Simeon is not, and ye will take 
Benjamin away; upon me are all these 
things come.’ 37And Reuben spoke 
unto his father, saying: ‘Thou shalt 
slay my two sons, if I bring him not to 
thee; deliver him into my hand, and I 
will bring him back to thee.’ 38And he 
said: ‘My son shall not go down with 
you; for his brother is dead, and he 
only is left; if harm befall him by the 
way in which ye go, then will ye bring 
down my gray hairs with sorrow to the 
grave. 

And the famine was sore in the 
land. 2And it came to pass, 
when they had eaten up the corn which 
they had brought out of Egypt, that 
their father said unto them: ‘Go again, 
buy us a little food.’ 3And Judah spoke 
unto him, saying: ‘The man did 
earnestly forewarn us, saying: Ye shall 
not see my face, except your brother 
be with you. 4If thou wilt send our 
brother with us, we will go down and 
buy thee food; 5but if thou wilt not 
send him, we will not go down, for the 
man said unto us: Ye shall not see my 
face, except your brother be with you.’ 
6And Israel said: ‘Wherefore dealt ye 
so ill with me, as to tell the man 
whether ye had yet a brother?’ 7And 
they said: ‘The man asked straitly 
concerning ourselves, and concerning 
our kindred, saying: Is your father yet 
alive? have ye another brother? and we 
told him according to the tenor of 
these words; could we in any wise 
know that he would say: Bring your 
brother down?’ 8And Judah said unto 
Israel his father: ‘Send the lad with 
me, and we will arise and go, that we 
may live, and not die, both we, and 
thou, and also our little ones. 9I will be 
surety for him; of my hand shalt thou 
require him; if I bring him not unto 
thee, and set him before thee, then let 
me bear the blame for ever. 10For 
except we had lingered, surely we had 
now returned a second time.’ 11And 
their father Israel said unto them: ‘If it 
be so now, do this: take of the choice 
fruits of the land in your vessels, and 
carry down the man a present, a little 
balm, and a little honey, spicery and 
ladanum, nuts, and almonds; 12and 
take double money in your hand; and 
the money that was returned in the 
mouth of your sacks carry back in your 
hand; peradventure it was an 
oversight; 13take also your brother, and 
43 




arise, go again unto the man; 14and 
God Almighty give you mercy before 
the man, that he may release unto you 
your other brother and Benjamin. And 
as for me, if I be bereaved of my 
children, I am bereaved.’ 

15And the men took that present, and 
they took double money in their hand, 
and Benjamin; and rose up, and went 
down to Egypt, and stood before 
Joseph. 16And when Joseph saw 
Benjamin with them, he said to the 
steward of his house: ‘Bring the men 
into the house, and kill the beasts, and 
prepare the meat; for the men shall 
dine with me at noon.’ 17And the man 
did as Joseph bade; and the man 
brought the men into Joseph’s house. 
18And the men were afraid, because 
they were brought into Joseph’s house; 
and they said: ‘Because of the money 
that was returned in our sacks at the 
first time are we brought in; that he 
may seek occasion against us, and fall 
upon us, and take us for bondmen, and 
our asses.’ 19And they came near to the 
steward of Joseph’s house, and they 
spoke unto him at the door of the 
house, 20and said: ‘Oh my lord, we 
came indeed down at the first time to 
buy food. 21And it came to pass, when 
we came to the lodging-place, that we 
opened our sacks, and, behold, every 
man’s money was in the mouth of his 
sack, our money in full weight; and we 
have brought it back in our hand. 
22And other money have we brought 
down in our hand to buy food. We 
know not who put our money in our 
sacks.’ 23And he said: ‘Peace be to 
you, fear not; your God, and the God 
of your father, hath given you treasure 
in your sacks; I had your money.’ And 
he brought Simeon out unto them. 
24And the man brought the men into 
Joseph’s house, and gave them water, 
and they washed their feet; and he 
gave their asses provender. 25And they 
made ready the present against 
Joseph’s coming at noon; for they 
heard that they should eat bread there. 
26And when Joseph came home, they 
brought him the present which was in 
their hand into the house, and bowed 
down to him to the earth. 27And he 
asked them of their welfare, and said: 
‘Is your father well, the old man of 
whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?’ 
28And they said: ‘Thy servant our 
father is well, he is yet alive.’ And 
they bowed the head, and made 
obeisance. 29And he lifted up his eyes, 
and saw Benjamin his brother, his 
mother’s son, and said: ‘Is this your 
youngest brother of whom ye spoke 
unto me?’ And he said: ‘God be 
gracious unto thee, my son.’ 30And 
Joseph made haste; for his heart 
yearned toward his brother; and he 
sought where to weep; and he entered 
into his chamber, and wept there. 
31And he washed his face, and came 
out; and he refrained himself, and said: 
‘Set on bread.’ 32And they set on for 
him by himself, and for them by 
themselves, and for the Egyptians, that 
did eat with him, by themselves; 
because the Egyptians might not eat 


bread with the Hebrews; for that is an 
abomination unto the Egyptians. 33And 
they sat before him, the firstborn 
according to his birthright, and the 
youngest according to his youth; and 
the men marvelled one with another. 
34And portions were taken unto them 
from before him; but Benjamin’s 
portion was five times so much as any 
of theirs. And they drank, and were 
merry with him. 

And he commanded the 
steward of his house, saying: 
‘Fill the men’s sacks with food, as 
much as they can carry, and put every 
man’s money in his sack’s mouth. 
2And put my goblet, the silver goblet, 
in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, 
and his corn money.’ And he did 
according to the word that Joseph had 
spoken. 3As soon as the morning was 
light, the men were sent away, they 
and their asses. 4And when they were 
gone out of the city, and were not yet 
far off, Joseph said unto his steward: 
‘Up, follow after the men; and when 
thou dost overtake them, say unto 
them: Wherefore have ye rewarded 
evil for good? 5Is not this it in which 
my lord drinketh, and whereby he 
indeed divineth? ye have done evil in 
so doing.’ 6And he overtook them, and 
he spoke unto them these words. 7And 
they said unto him: ‘Wherefore 
speaketh my lord such words as these? 
Far be it from thy servants that they 
should do such a thing. 8Behold, the 
money, which we found in our 
sacks’mouths, we brought back unto 
thee out of the land of Canaan; how 
then should we steal out of thy lord’s 
house silver or gold? 9With 
whomsoever of thy servants it be 
found, let him die, and we also will be 
my lord’s bondmen.’ 10And he said: 
‘Now also let it be according unto your 
words: he with whom it is found shall 
be my bondman; and ye shall be 
blameless.’ 11Then they hastened, and 
took down every man his sack to the 
ground, and opened every man his 
sack. 12And he searched, beginning at 
the eldest, and leaving off at the 
youngest; and the goblet was found in 
Benjamin’s sack. 13And they rent their 
clothes, and laded every man his ass, 
and returned to the city. 14And Judah 
and his brethren came to Joseph’s 
house, and he was yet there; and they 
fell before him on the ground. 15And 
Joseph said unto them: ‘What deed is 
this that ye have done? know ye not 
that such a man as I will indeed 
divine?’ 16And Judah said: ‘What shall 
we say unto my lord? what shall we 
speak? or how shall we clear 
ourselves? God hath found out the 
iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are 
my lord’s bondmen, both we, and he 
also in whose hand the cup is found.’ 
17And he said: ‘Far be it from me that I 
should do so; the man in whose hand 
the goblet is found, he shall be my 
bondman; but as for you, get you up in 
peace unto your father.’ 

 

 

 

 
44 





 

18Then Judah came near unto him, 
and said: ‘Oh my lord, let thy servant, 
I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s 
ears, and let not thine anger burn 
against thy servant; for thou art even 
as Pharaoh. 19My lord asked his 
servants, saying: Have ye a father, or a 
brother? 20And we said unto my lord: 
We have a father, an old man, and a 
child of his old age, a little one; and 
his brother is dead, and he alone is left 
of his mother, and his father loveth 
him. 21And thou saidst unto thy 
servants: Bring him down unto me, 
that I may set mine eyes upon him. 
22And we said unto my lord: The lad 
cannot leave his father; for if he should 
leave his father, his father would die. 
23And thou saidst unto thy servants: 
Except your youngest brother come 
down with you, ye shall see my face 
no more. 24And it came to pass when 
we came up unto thy servant my 
father, we told him the words of my 
lord. 25And our father said: Go again, 
buy us a little food. 26And we said: We 
cannot go down; if our youngest 
brother be with us, then will we go 
down; for we may not see the man’s 
face, except our youngest brother be 
with us. 27And thy servant my father 
said unto us: Ye know that my wife 
bore me two sons; 28and the one went 
out from me, and I said: Surely he is 
torn in pieces; and I have not seen him 
since; 29and if ye take this one also 
from me, and harm befall him, ye will 
bring down my gray hairs with sorrow 
to the grave. 30Now therefore when I 
come to thy servant my father, and the 
lad is not with us; seeing that his soul 
is bound up with the lad’s soul; 31it 
will come to pass, when he seeth that 
the lad is not with us, that he will die; 
and thy servants will bring down the 
gray hairs of thy servant our father 
with sorrow to the grave. 32For thy 
servant became surety for the lad unto 
my father, saying: If I bring him not 
unto thee, then shall I bear the blame 
to my father for ever. 33Now therefore, 
let thy servant, I pray thee, abide 
instead of the lad a bondman to my 
lord; and let the lad go up with his 
brethren. 34For how shall I go up to my 
father, if the lad be not with me? lest I 
look upon the evil that shall come on 
my father.’ 

Then Joseph could not refrain 
himself before all them that 
stood by him; and he cried: ‘Cause 
every man to go out from me.’ And 
there stood no man with him, while 
Joseph made himself known unto his 
brethren. 2And he wept aloud; and the 
Egyptians heard, and the house of 
Pharaoh heard. 3And Joseph said unto 
his brethren: ‘I am Joseph; doth my 
father yet live?’ And his brethren 
could not answer him; for they were 
affrighted at his presence. 4And Joseph 
said unto his brethren: ‘Come near to 
me, I pray you.’ And they came near. 
And he said: ‘I am Joseph your 
brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. 
5And now be not grieved, nor angry 
45 




with yourselves, that ye sold me 
hither; for God did send me before you 
to preserve life. 6For these two years 
hath the famine been in the land; and 
there are yet five years, in which there 
shall be neither plowing nor harvest. 
7And God sent me before you to give 
you a remnant on the earth, and to save 
you alive for a great deliverance. 8So 
now it was not you that sent me hither, 
but God; and He hath made me a 
father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his 
house, and ruler over all the land of 
Egypt. 9Hasten ye, and go up to my 
father, and say unto him: Thus saith 
thy son Joseph: God hath made me 
lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, 
tarry not. 10And thou shalt dwell in the 
land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near 
unto me, thou, and thy children, and 
thy children’s children, and thy flocks, 
and thy herds, and all that thou hast; 
11and there will I sustain thee; for there 
are yet five years of famine; lest thou 
come to poverty, thou, and thy 
household, and all that thou hast. 
12And, behold, your eyes see, and the 
eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is 
my mouth that speaketh unto you. 
13And ye shall tell my father of all my 
glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have 
seen; and ye shall hasten and bring 
down my father hither.’ 14And he fell 
upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and 
wept; and Benjamin wept upon his 
neck. 15And he kissed all his brethren, 
and wept upon them; and after that his 
brethren talked with him. 

16And the report thereof was heard 
in Pharaoh’s house, saying: ‘Joseph’s 
brethren are come’; and it pleased 
Pharaoh well, and his servants. 17And 
Pharaoh said unto Joseph: ‘Say unto 
thy brethren: This do ye: lade your 
beasts, and go, get you unto the land of 
Canaan; 18and take your father and 
your households, and come unto me; 
and I will give you the good of the 
land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat 
of the land. 19Now thou art 
commanded, this do ye: take you 
wagons out of the land of Egypt for 
your little ones, and for your wives, 
and bring your father, and come. 
20Also regard not your stuff; for the 
good things of all the land of Egypt are 
yours.’ 21And the sons of Israel did so; 
and Joseph gave them wagons, 
according to the commandment of 
Pharaoh, and gave them provision for 
the way. 22To all of them he gave each 
man changes of raiment; but to 
Benjamin he gave three hundred 
shekels of silver, and five changes of 
raiment. 23And to his father he sent in 
like manner ten asses laden with the 
good things of Egypt, and ten she-
asses laden with corn and bread and 
victual for his father by the way. 24So 
he sent his brethren away, and they 
departed; and he said unto them: ‘See 
that ye fall not out by the way.’ 25And 
they went up out of Egypt, and came 
into the land of Canaan unto Jacob 
their father. 26And they told him, 
saying: ‘Joseph is yet alive, and he is 
ruler over all the land of Egypt.’ And 


his heart fainted, for he believed them 
not. 27And they told him all the words 
of Joseph, which he had said unto 
them; and when he saw the wagons 
which Joseph had sent to carry him, 
the spirit of Jacob their father revived. 
28And Israel said: ‘It is enough; Joseph 
my son is yet alive; I will go and see 
him before I die.’ 

And Israel took his journey 
with all that he had, and came 
to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices 
unto the God of his father Isaac. 2And 
God spoke unto Israel in the visions of 
the night, and said: ‘Jacob, Jacob.’ 
And he said: ‘Here am I.’ 3And He 
said: ‘I am God, the God of thy father; 
fear not to go down into Egypt; for I 
will there make of thee a great nation. 
4I will go down with thee into Egypt; 
and I will also surely bring thee up 
again; and Joseph shall put his hand 
upon thine eyes.’ 5And Jacob rose up 
from Beer-sheba; and the sons of 
Israel carried Jacob their father, and 
their little ones, and their wives, in the 
wagons which Pharaoh had sent to 
carry him. 6And they took their cattle, 
and their goods, which they had gotten 
in the land of Canaan, and came into 
Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with 
him; 7his sons, and his sons’sons with 
him, his daughters, and his 
sons’daughters, and all his seed 
brought he with him into Egypt. 

8And these are the names of the 
children of Israel, who came into 
Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, 
Jacob’s first-born. 9And the sons of 
Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and 
Hezron, and Carmi. 10And the sons of 
Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, 
and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the 
son of a Canaanitish woman. 11And the 
sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and 
Merari. 12And the sons of Judah: Er, 
and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and 
Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the 
land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez 
were Hezron and Hamul. 13And the 
sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and 
Iob, and Shimron. 14And the sons of 
Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. 
15These are the sons of Leah, whom 
she bore unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, 
with his daughter Dinah; all the souls 
of his sons and his daughters were 
thirty and three. 16And the sons of 
Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and 
Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 
17And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and 
Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and 
Serah their sister; and the sons of 
Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel. 18These 
are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban 
gave to Leah his daughter, and these 
she bore unto Jacob, even sixteen 
souls. 19The sons of Rachel Jacob’s 
wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 20And 
unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were 
born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom 
Asenath the daughter of Poti-phera 
priest of On bore unto him. 21And the 
sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, 
and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, 
and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and 
Ard. 22These are the sons of Rachel, 
who were born to Jacob; all the souls 
46 




were fourteen. 23And the sons of Dan: 
Hushim. 24And the sons of Naphtali: 
Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and 
Shillem. 25These are the sons of 
Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel 
his daughter, and these she bore unto 
Jacob; all the souls were seven. 26All 
the souls belonging to Jacob that came 
into Egypt, that came out of his loins, 
besides Jacob’s sons’wives, all the 
souls were threescore and six. 27And 
the sons of Joseph, who were born to 
him in Egypt, were two souls; all the 
souls of the house of Jacob, that came 
into Egypt, were threescore and ten. 

28And he sent Judah before him unto 
Joseph, to show the way before him 
unto Goshen; and they came into the 
land of Goshen. 29And Joseph made 
ready his chariot, and went up to meet 
Israel his father, to Goshen; and he 
presented himself unto him, and fell on 
his neck, and wept on his neck a good 
while. 30And Israel said unto Joseph: 
‘Now let me die, since I have seen thy 
face, that thou art yet alive.’ 31And 
Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto 
his father’s house: ‘I will go up, and 
tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him: 
My brethren, and my father’s house, 
who were in the land of Canaan, are 
come unto me; 32and the men are 
shepherds, for they have been keepers 
of cattle; and they have brought their 
flocks, and their herds, and all that 
they have. 33And it shall come to pass, 
when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall 
say: What is your occupation? 34that ye 
shall say: Thy servants have been 
keepers of cattle from our youth even 
until now, both we, and our fathers; 
that ye may dwell in the land of 
Goshen; for every shepherd is an 
abomination unto the Egyptians.’ 

Then Joseph went in and told 
Pharaoh, and said: ‘My father 
and my brethren, and their flocks, and 
their herds, and all that they have, are 
come out of the land of Canaan; and, 
behold, they are in the land of 
Goshen.’ 2And from among his 
brethren he took five men, and 
presented them unto Pharaoh. 3And 
Pharaoh said unto his brethren: ‘What 
is your occupation?’ And they said 
unto Pharaoh: ‘Thy servants are 
shepherds, both we, and our fathers.’ 
4And they said unto Pharaoh: ‘To 
sojourn in the land are we come; for 
there is no pasture for thy 
servants’flocks; for the famine is sore 
in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, 
we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in 
the land of Goshen.’ 5And Pharaoh 
spoke unto Joseph, saying: ‘Thy father 
and thy brethren are come unto thee; 
6the land of Egypt is before thee; in the 
best of the land make thy father and 
thy brethren to dwell; in the land of 
Goshen let them dwell. And if thou 
knowest any able men among them, 
then make them rulers over my cattle.’ 
7And Joseph brought in Jacob his 
father, and set him before Pharaoh. 
And Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 8And 
Pharaoh said unto Jacob: ‘How many 
are the days of the years of thy life?’ 
9And Jacob said unto Pharaoh: ‘The 
47 




days of the years of my sojournings 
are a hundred and thirty years; few and 
evil have been the days of the years of 
my life, and they have not attained 
unto the days of the years of the life of 
my fathers in the days of their 
sojournings.’ 10And Jacob blessed 
Pharaoh, and went out from the 
presence of Pharaoh. 11And Joseph 
placed his father and his brethren, and 
gave them a possession in the land of 
Egypt, in the best of the land, in the 
land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had 
commanded. 12And Joseph sustained 
his father, and his brethren, and all his 
father’s household, with bread, 
according to the want of their little 
ones. 

13And there was no bread in all the 
land; for the famine was very sore, so 
that the land of Egypt and the land of 
Canaan languished by reason of the 
famine. 14And Joseph gathered up all 
the money that was found in the land 
of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, 
for the corn which they bought; and 
Joseph brought the money into 
Pharaoh’s house. 15And when the 
money was all spent in the land of 
Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all 
the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and 
said: ‘Give us bread; for why should 
we die in thy presence? for our money 
faileth.’ 16And Joseph said: ‘Give your 
cattle, and I will give you [bread] for 
your cattle, if money fail.’ 17And they 
brought their cattle unto Joseph. And 
Joseph gave them bread in exchange 
for the horses, and for the flocks, and 
for the herds, and for the asses; and he 
fed them with bread in exchange for 
all their cattle for that year. 18And 
when that year was ended, they came 
unto him the second year, and said 
unto him: ‘We will not hide from my 
lord, how that our money is all spent; 
and the herds of cattle are my lord’s; 
there is nought left in the sight of my 
lord, but our bodies, and our lands. 
19Wherefore should we die before 
thine eyes, both we and our land? buy 
us and our land for bread, and we and 
our land will be bondmen unto 
Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we 
may live, and not die, and that the land 
be not desolate.’ 20So Joseph bought 
all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for 
the Egyptians sold every man his field, 
because the famine was sore upon 
them; and the land became Pharaoh’s. 
21And as for the people, he removed 
them city by city, from one end of the 
border of Egypt even to the other end 
thereof. 22Only the land of the priests 
bought he not, for the priests had a 
portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their 
portion which Pharaoh gave them; 
wherefore they sold not their land. 
23Then Joseph said unto the people: 
‘Behold, I have bought you this day 
and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is 
seed for you, and ye shall sow the 
land. 24And it shall come to pass at the 
ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth 
unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be 
your own, for seed of the field, and for 
your food, and for them of your 
households, and for food for your little 


ones.’ 25And they said: ‘Thou hast 
saved our lives. Let us find favour in 
the sight of my lord, and we will be 
Pharaoh’s bondmen.’ 26And Joseph 
made it a statute concerning the land 
of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh 
should have the fifth; only the land of 
the priests alone became not 
Pharaoh’s. 27And Israel dwelt in the 
land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; 
and they got them possessions therein, 
and were fruitful, and multiplied 
exceedingly. 


28And Jacob lived in the land of 
Egypt seventeen years; so the days of 
Jacob, the years of his life, were a 
hundred forty and seven years. 29And 
the time drew near that Israel must die; 
and he called his son Joseph, and said 
unto him: ‘If now I have found favour 
in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand 
under my thigh, and deal kindly and 
truly with me; bury me not, I pray 
thee, in Egypt. 30But when I sleep with 
my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of 
Egypt, and bury me in their burying-
place.’ And he said: ‘I will do as thou 
hast said.’ 31And he said: ‘Swear unto 
me.’ And he swore unto him. And 
Israel bowed down upon the bed’s 
head. 

And it came to pass after these 
things, that one said to Joseph: 
‘Behold, thy father is sick.’ And he 
took with him his two sons, Manasseh 
and Ephraim. 2And one told Jacob, and 
said: ‘Behold, thy son Joseph cometh 
unto thee.’ And Israel strengthened 
himself, and sat upon the bed. 3And 
Jacob said unto Joseph: ‘God 
Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in 
the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
4and said unto me: Behold, I will make 
thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I 
will make of thee a company of 
peoples; and will give this land to thy 
seed after thee for an everlasting 
possession. 5And now thy two sons, 
who were born unto thee in the land of 
Egypt before I came unto thee into 
Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and 
Manasseh, even as Reuben and 
Simeon, shall be mine. 6And thy issue, 
that thou begettest after them, shall be 
thine; they shall be called after the 
name of their brethren in their 
inheritance. 7And as for me, when I 
came from Paddan, Rachel died unto 
me in the land of Canaan in the way, 
when there was still some way to come 
unto Ephrath; and I buried her there in 
the way to Ephrath—the same is Beth-
lehem.’ 8And Israel beheld Joseph’s 
sons, and said: ‘Who are these?’ 9And 
Joseph said unto his father: ‘They are 
my sons, whom God hath given me 
here.’ And he said: ‘Bring them, I pray 
thee, unto me, and I will bless them.’ 
10Now the eyes of Israel were dim for 
age, so that he could not see. And he 
brought them near unto him; and he 
kissed them, and embraced them. 
11And Israel said unto Joseph: ‘I had 
not thought to see thy face; and, lo, 
God hath let me see thy seed also.’ 
12And Joseph brought them out from 
between his knees; and he fell down 
48 




on his face to the earth. 13And Joseph 
took them both, Ephraim in his right 
hand toward Israel’s left hand, and 
Manasseh in his left hand toward 
Israel’s right hand, and brought them 
near unto him. 14And Israel stretched 
out his right hand, and laid it upon 
Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, 
and his left hand upon Manasseh’s 
head, guiding his hands wittingly; for 
Manasseh was the first-born. 15And he 
blessed Joseph, and said: ‘The God 
before whom my fathers Abraham and 
Isaac did walk, the God who hath been 
my shepherd all my life long unto this 
day, 16the angel who hath redeemed 
me from all evil, bless the lads; and let 
my name be named in them, and the 
name of my fathers Abraham and 
Isaac; and let them grow into a 
multitude in the midst of the earth.’ 
17And when Joseph saw that his father 
was laying his right hand upon the 
head of Ephraim, it displeased him, 
and he held up his father’s hand, to 
remove it from Ephraim’s head unto 
Manasseh’s head. 18And Joseph said 
unto his father: ‘Not so, my father, for 
this is the first-born; put thy right hand 
upon his head.’ 19And his father 
refused, and said: ‘I know it, my son, I 
know it; he also shall become a 
people, and he also shall be great; 
howbeit his younger brother shall be 
greater than he, and his seed shall 
become a multitude of nations.’ 20And 
he blessed them that day, saying: ‘By 
thee shall Israel bless, saying: God 
make thee as Ephraim and as 
Manasseh.’ And he set Ephraim before 
Manasseh. 21And Israel said unto 
Joseph: ‘Behold, I die; but God will be 
with you, and bring you back unto the 
land of your fathers. 22Moreover I have 
given to thee one aportion above thy 
brethren, which I took out of the hand 
of the Amorite with my sword and 
with my bow.’

49 



And Jacob called unto his 
sons, and said: ‘Gather 
yourselves together, that I may tell you 
that which shall befall you in the end 
of days. 

2Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye 
sons of Jacob; 

And hearken unto Israel your father. 

3Reuben, thou art my first-born, 

My might, and the first-fruits of my 
strength; 

The excellency of dignity, and the 
excellency of power. 

4Unstable as water, have not thou 
the excellency; 

Because thou wentest up to thy 
father’s bed; 

Then defiledst thou it—he went up 
to my couch. 

 

5Simeon and Levi are brethren; 

Weapons of violence their kinship. 

6Let my soul not come into their 
council; 

Unto their assembly let my glory not 
be not united; 

For in their anger they slew men, 


And in their self-will they houghed 
oxen. 

7Cursed be their anger, for it was 
fierce, 

And their wrath, for it was cruel; 

I will divide them in Jacob, 

And scatter them in Israel 

 

8Judah, thee shall thy brethren 
praise; 

Thy hand shall be on the neck of 
thine enemies; 

Thy father’s sons shall bow down 
before thee. 

9Judah is a lion’s whelp; 

From the prey, my son, thou art 
gone up. 

He stooped down, he couched as a 
lion, 

And as a lioness; who shall rouse 
him up? 

10The sceptre shall not depart from 
Judah, 

Nor the ruler’s staff from between 
his feet, 

As long as men come to Shiloh; 

And unto him shall the obedience of 
the peoples be. 

11Binding his foal unto the vine, 

And his ass’s colt unto the choice 
vine; 

He washeth his garments in wine, 

And his vesture in the blood of 
grapes; 

12His eyes shall be red with wine, 

And his teeth white with milk. 

 

13Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of 
the sea, 

And he shall be a shore for ships, 

And his flank shall be upon Zidon. 

 

14Issachar is a large-boned ass, 

Couching down between the sheep-
folds. 

15For he saw a resting-place that it 
was good, 

And the land that it was pleasant; 

And he bowed his shoulder to bear, 

And became a servant under task-
work 

 

16Dan shall judge his people,

17Dan shall be a serpent in the way,

So that his rider falleth backward.

22Joseph is a fruitful vine, 

A fruitful vine by a fountain; 

Its branches run over the wall. 


23The archers have dealt bitterly 
with him, 

And shot at him, and hated him; 

24But his bow abode firm, 

And the arms of his hands were 
made supple, 

By the hands of the Mighty One of 
Jacob, 

From thence, from the Shepherd, the 
Stone of Israel, 

25Even by the God of thy father, 
who shall help thee, 

And by the Almighty, who shall 
bless thee, 

With blessings of heaven above, 

Blessings of the deep that coucheth 
beneath, 

Blessings of the breasts, and of the 
womb. 

26The blessings of thy father 

Are mighty beyond the blessings of 
my progenitors 

Unto the utmost bound of the 
everlasting hills; 

They shall be on the head of Joseph, 

And on the crown of the head of the 
prince among his brethren. 

 

27Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth; 

In the morning he devoureth the 
prey, 

And at even he divideth the spoil.’ 

 

28All these are the twelve tribes of 
Israel, and this is it that their father 
spoke unto them and blessed them; 
every one according to his blessing he 
blessed them. 29And be charged them, 
and said unto them: ‘I am to be 
gathered unto my people; bury me 
with my fathers in the cave that is in 
the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30in the 
cave that is in the field of Machpelah, 
which is before Mamre, in the land of 
Canaan, which Abraham bought with 
the field from Ephron the Hittite for a 
possession of a burying-place. 31There 
they buried Abraham and Sarah his 
wife; there they buried Isaac and 
Rebekah his wife; and there I buried 
Leah. 32The field and the cave that is 
therein, which was purchased from the 
children of Heth.’ 33And when Jacob 
made an end of charging his sons, he 
gathered up his feet into the bed, and 
expired, and was gathered unto his 
people. 

And Joseph fell upon his 
father’s face, and wept upon 
him, and kissed him. 2And Joseph 
commanded his servants the 
physicians to embalm his father. And 
the physicians embalmed Israel. 3And 
forty days were fulfilled for him; for 
so are fulfilled the days of embalming. 
And the Egyptians wept for him 
threescore and ten days. 

4And when the days of weeping for 
him were past, Joseph spoke unto the 
house of Pharaoh, saying: ‘If now I 
have found favour in your eyes, speak, 
I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, 
saying: 5My father made me swear, 
saying: Lo, I die; in my grave which I 
have digged for me in the land of 
Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now 
therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and 
bury my father, and I will come back.’ 
50 




6And Pharaoh said: ‘Go up, and bury 
thy father, according as he made thee 
swear.’ 7And Joseph went up to bury 
his father; and with him went up all 
the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of 
his house, and all the elders of the land 
of Egypt, 8and all the house of Joseph, 
and his brethren, and his father’s 
house; only their little ones, and their 
flocks, and their herds, they left in the 
land of Goshen. 9And there went up 
with him both chariots and horsemen; 
and it was a very great company. 
10And they came to the threshing-floor 
of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, 
and there they wailed with a very great 
and sore wailing; and he made a 
mourning for his father seven days. 
11And when the inhabitants of the land, 
the Canaanites, saw the mourning in 
the floor of Atad, they said: ‘This is a 
grievous amourning to the Egyptians.’ 
Wherefore the name of it was called 
Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the 
Jordan. 12And his sons did unto him 
according as he commanded them. 
13For his sons carried him into the land 
of Canaan, and buried him in the cave 
of the field of Machpelah, which 
Abraham bought with the field, for a 
possession of a burying-place, of 
Ephron the Hittite, in front of Mamre. 

a Heb. ebel. 

14And Joseph returned into Egypt, 
he, and his brethren, and all that went 
up with him to bury his father, after he 
had buried his father. 15And when 
Joseph’s brethren saw that their father 

was dead, they said: ‘It may be that 
Joseph will hate us, and will fully 
requite us all the evil which we did 
unto him.’ 16And they sent a message 
unto Joseph, saying: ‘Thy father did 
command before he died, saying: 17So 
shall ye say unto Joseph: Forgive, I 
pray thee now, the transgression of thy 
brethren, and their sin, for that they did 
unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, 
forgive the transgression of the 
servants of the God of thy father.’ And 
Joseph wept when they spoke unto 
him. 18And his brethren also went and 
fell down before his face; and they 
said: ‘Behold, we are thy bondmen.’ 
19And Joseph said unto them: ‘Fear 
not; for am I in the place of God? 
20And as for you, ye meant evil against 
me; but God meant it for good, to 
bring to pass, as it is this day, to save 
much people alive. 21Now therefore 
fear ye not; I will sustain you, and 
your little ones.’ And he comforted 
them, and spoke kindly unto them. 

22And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, 
and his father’s house; and Joseph 
lived a hundred and ten years. 23And 
Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the 
third generation; the children also of 
Machir the son of Manasseh were born 
upon Joseph’s knees. 24And Joseph 
said unto his brethren: ‘I die; but God 
will surely remember you, and bring 
you up out of this land unto the land 
which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, 
and to Jacob.’ 25And Joseph took an 
oath of the children of Israel, saying: 
‘God will surely remember you, and 


ye shall carry up my bones from 
hence.’ 26So Joseph died, being a 
hundred and ten years old. And they 
embalmed him, and he was put in a 
coffin in Egypt.
