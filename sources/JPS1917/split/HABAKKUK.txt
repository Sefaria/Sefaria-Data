HABAKKUK 

 

THE burden which Habakkuk the 
prophet did see. 

 

2How long, O LORD, shall I cry, 

And Thou wilt not hear? 

I cry out unto Thee of violence, 

And Thou wilt not save. 

3Why dost Thou show me iniquity, 

And beholdest mischief? 

And why are spoiling and violence 
before me? 

So that there is strife, and contention 
ariseth. 

4Therefore the law is slacked, 

And right doth never go forth; 

For the wicked doth beset the 
righteous; 

Therefore right goeth forth 
perverted. 

 

5Look ye among the nations, and 
behold, 

And wonder marvellously; 

For, behold, a work shall be 
wrought in your days, 

Which ye will not believe though it 
be told you. 

6For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, 

That bitter and impetuous nation, 

That march through the breadth of 
the earth, 

To possess dwelling-places that are 
not theirs. 

7They are terrible and dreadful; 

Their law and their majesty proceed 
from themselves. 

8Their horses also are swifter than 
leopards, 

And are more fierce than the wolves 
of the desert; 

And their horsemen spread 
themselves; 

Yea, their horsemen come from far, 

They fly as a vulture that hasteth to 
devour. 

9They come all of them for violence; 

Their faces are set eagerly as the 
east wind; 

And they gather captives as the 
sand. 

10And they scoff at kings, 

And princes are a derision unto 
them; 

They deride every stronghold, 

For they heap up earth, and take it. 

11Then their spirit doth pass over 
and transgress, 

And they become guilty: 

Even they who impute their might 
unto their god. 

 

12Art not Thou from everlasting, 

O LORD my God, my Holy One? 

We shall not die. 

O LORD, Thou hast ordained them 
for judgment, 

And Thou, O Rock, hast established 
them for correction. 
1 




13Thou that art of eyes too pure to 
behold evil, 

And that canst not look on mischief, 

Wherefore lookest Thou, when they 
deal treacherously, 

And holdest Thy peace, when the 
wicked swalloweth up 

The man that is more righteous than 
he; 

14And makest men as the fishes of 
the sea, 

As the creeping things, that have no 
ruler over them? 

15They take up all of them with the 
angle, 

They catch them in their net, 

And gather them in their drag; 

Therefore they rejoice and exult. 

16Therefore they sacrifice unto their 
net, 

And offer unto their drag; 

Because by them their portion is fat, 

And their food plenteous. 

17Shall they therefore empty their 
net, 

And not spare to slay the nations 
continually? 

 

I will stand upon my watch, 

And set me upon the tower, 

And will look out to see what He 
will speak by me, 

And what I shall answer when I am 
reproved. 

2And the LORD answered me, and 
said: 

‘Write the vision, and make it plain 
upon tables, 

That a man may read it swiftly. 

3For the vision is yet for the 
appointed time, 

And it declareth of the end, and doth 
not lie; 

Though it tarry, wait for it; 

Because it will surely come, it will 
not delay.’ 

 

4Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is 
not upright in him; 

But the righteous shall live by his 
faith. 

5Yea, moreover, wine is a 
treacherous dealer; 

The haughty man abideth not; 

He who enlargeth his desire as the 
nether-world, 

And is as death, and cannot be 
satisfied, 

But gathereth unto him all nations, 

And heapeth unto him all peoples. 

6Shall not all these take up a parable 
against him, 

And a taunting riddle against him, 

And say: ‘Woe to him that 
increaseth that which is not his! 

How long? and that ladeth himself 
with many pledges! ’ 

7Shall they not rise up suddenly that 
shall exact interest of thee, 

And awake that shall violently 
shake thee, 

And thou shalt be for booties unto 
them? 

8Because thou hast spoiled many 
nations, 

All the remnant of the peoples shall 
spoil thee; 
2 




Because of men’s blood, and for the 
violence done to the land, 

To the city and to all that dwell 
therein. 

 

9Woe to him that gaineth evil gains 
for his house, 

That he may set his nest on high, 

That he may be delivered from the 
power of evil! 

10Thou hast devised shame to thy 
house, 

By cutting off many peoples, 

And hast forfeited thy life. 

11For the stone shall cry out of the 
wall, 

And the beam out of the timber shall 
answer it. 

 

12Woe to him that buildeth a town 
with blood, 

And establisheth a city by iniquity! 

13Behold, is it not of the LORD of 
hosts 

That the peoples labour for the fire, 

And the nations weary themselves 
for vanity? 

14For the earth shall be filled 

With the knowledge of the glory of 
the LORD, 

As the waters cover the sea. 

 

15Woe unto him that giveth his 
neighbour drink, 

That puttest thy venom thereto, and 
makest him drunken also, 

That thou mayest look on their 
nakedness! 

16Thou art filled with shame instead 
of glory, 

Drink thou also, and be uncovered; 

The cup of the LORD’S right hand 
shall be turned unto thee, 

And filthiness shall be upon thy 
glory. 

17For the violence done to Lebanon 
shall cover thee, 

And the destruction of the beasts, 
which made them afraid; 

Because of men’s blood, and for the 
violence done to the land, 

To the city and to all that dwell 
therein. 

 

18What profiteth the graven image, 

That the maker thereof hath graven 
it, 

Even the molten image, and the 
teacher of lies; 

That the maker of his work trusteth 
therein, 

To make dumb idols? 

19Woe unto him that saith to the 
wood: ‘Awake’, 

To the dumb stone: ‘Arise! ’ 

Can this teach? 

Behold, it is overlaid with gold and 
silver, 

And there is no breath at all in the 
midst of it. 

20But the LORD is in His holy temple; 

Let all the earth keep silence before 
Him. 

 

A prayer of Habakkuk the 
prophet. Upon Shigionoth. 

 
3 




2O LORD, I have heard the report of 
Thee, and am afraid; 

O LORD, revive Thy work in the 
midst of the years, 

In the midst of the years make it 
known; 

In wrath remember compassion. 

3God cometh from Teman, 

And the Holy One from mount 
Paran. Selah 

His glory covereth the heavens, 

And the earth is full of His praise. 

4And a brightness appeareth as the 
light; 

Rays hath He at His side; 

And there is the hiding of His 
power. 

5Before him goeth the pestilence, 

And fiery bolts go forth at His feet. 

6He standeth, and shaketh the earth, 

He beholdeth, and maketh the 
nations to tremble; 

And the everlasting mountains are 
dashed in pieces, 

The ancient hills do bow; 

His goings are as of old. 

7I see the tents of Cushan in 
affliction; 

The curtains of the land of Midian 
do tremble. 

8Is it, O LORD, that against the rivers, 

Is it that Thine anger is kindled 
against the rivers, 

Or Thy wrath against the sea? 

That Thou dost ride upon Thy 
horses, 

Upon Thy chariots of victory? 

9Thy bow is made quite bare; 

Sworn are the rods of the word. 

Selah. 

Thou dost cleave the earth with 
rivers. 

10The mountains have seen Thee, 
and they tremble; 

The tempest of waters floweth over; 
the deep uttereth its voice, 

And lifteth up its hands on high. 

11The sun and moon stand still in 
their habitation; 

At the light of Thine arrows as they 
go, 

At the shining of Thy glittering 
spear. 

12Thou marchest through the earth in 
indignation, 

Thou threshest the nations in anger. 

13Thou art come forth for the 
deliverance of Thy people, 

For the deliverance of Thine 
anointed; 

Thou woundest the head out of the 
house of the wicked, 

Uncovering the foundation even 

unto the neck. Selah 

14Thou hast stricken through with 
his own rods the head of his 
rulers, 

That come as a whirlwind to scatter 
me; 

Whose rejoicing is as to devour the 
poor secretly. 

15Thou hast trodden the sea with 
Thy horses, 

The foaming of mighty waters. 

16When I heard, mine inward parts 
trembled, 

My lips quivered at the voice; 

Rottenness entereth into my bones, 


And I tremble where I stand; 

That I should wait for the day of 
trouble, 

When he cometh up against the 
people that he invadeth. 

17For though the fig-tree shall not 
blossom, 

Neither shall fruit be in the vines; 

The labour of the olive shall fail, 

And the fields shall yield no food; 

The flock shall be cut off from the 
fold, 

And there shall be no herd in the 
stalls; 

18Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, 

I will exult in the God of my 
salvation. 

19God, the Lord, is my strength, 

And He maketh my feet like 
hinds’feet, 

And He maketh me to walk upon 
my high places. 

 

For the Leader. With my string-
music.
