NAHUM 

 

The burden of Nineveh. The book 
of the vision of Nahum the 
Elkoshite. 

2The LORD is a jealous and avenging 
God, 

The LORD avengeth and is full of 
wrath; 

The LORD taketh vengeance on His 
adversaries, 

And He reserveth wrath for His 
enemies. 

3The LORD is long-suffering, and 
great in power, 

And will by no means clear the 
guilty; 

The LORD, in the whirlwind and in 
the storm is His way, 

And the clouds are the dust of His 
feet. 

4He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it 
dry, 

And drieth up all the rivers; 

Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, 

And the flower of Lebanon 
languisheth. 

5The mountains quake at Him, 

And the hills melt; 

And the earth is upheaved at His 
presence, 

Yea, the world, and all that dwell 
therein. 

6Who can stand before His 
indignation? 

And who can abide in the fierceness 
of His anger? 

His fury is poured out like fire, 

And the rocks are broken asunder 
before Him. 

7The LORD is good, 

A stronghold in the day of trouble; 

And He knoweth them that take 
refuge in Him. 

8But with an overrunning flood 

He will make a full end of the place 
thereof, 

And darkness shall pursue His 
enemies. 

9What do ye devise against the 
LORD? 

He will make a full end; 

Trouble shall not rise up the second 
time. 
1 




10For though they be like tangled 
thorns, 

And be drunken according to their 
drink, 

They shall be devoured as stubble 
fully dry. 

11Out of thee came he forth, 

That deviseth evil against the LORD, 

That counselleth wickedness. 

12Thus saith the LORD: 

Though they be in full strength, and 
likewise many, 

Even so shall they be cut down, and 
he shall pass away; 

And though I have afflicted thee, I 
will afflict thee no more. 

13And now will I break his yoke 
from off thee, 

And will burst thy bonds in sunder. 

14And the LORD hath given 
commandment concerning thee, 

That no more of thy name be sown; 

Out of the house of thy god will I 
cut off 

The graven image and the molten 
image; 

I will make thy grave; for thou art 
become worthless. 

 

Behold upon the mountains the 
feet of him 

That bringeth good tidings, that 
announceth peace! 

Keep thy feasts, O Judah, 

Perform thy vows; 

For the wicked one shall no more 
pass through thee; 

He is utterly cut off. 

 

2A maul is come up before thy face; 

Guard the defences, 

Watch the way, make thy loins 
strong, 

Fortify thy power mightily!— 

3For the LORD restoreth the pride of 
Jacob, 

As the pride of Israel; 

For the emptiers have emptied them 
out, 

And marred their vine-branches.— 

4The shield of his mighty men is 
made red, 

The valiant men are in scarlet; 

The chariots are fire of steel in the 
day of his preparation, 

And the cypress spears are made to 
quiver. 

5The chariots rush madly in the 
streets, 

They jostle one against another in 
the broad places; 

The appearance of them is like 
torches, 

They run to and fro like the 
lightnings. 

 

6He bethinketh himself of his 
worthies; 

They stumble in their march; 

They make haste to the wall thereof, 

And the mantelet is prepared. 

7The gates of the rivers are opened, 

And the palace is dissolved. 

8And the queen is uncovered, she is 
carried away, 

And her handmaids moan as with 
the voice of doves, 

Tabering upon their breasts. 
2 




 

9But Nineveh hath been from of old 
like a pool of water; 

Yet they flee away; 

‘Stand, stand’; 

But none looketh back. 

10Take ye the spoil of silver, take the 
spoil of gold; 

For there is no end of the store, 

Rich with all precious vessels. 

11She is empty, and void, and waste; 

And the heart melteth, and the knees 
smite together, 

And convulsion is in all loins, 

And the faces of them all have 
gathered blackness. 

 

12Where is the den of the lions, 

Which was the feeding-place of the 
young lions, 

Where the lion and the lioness 
walked, and the lion’s whelp, 

And none made them afraid? 

13The lion did tear in pieces enough 
for his whelps, 

And strangled for his lionesses, 

And filled his caves with prey, 

And his dens with ravin. 

14Behold, I am against thee, saith the 
LORD of hosts, 

And I will burn her chariots in the 
smoke, 

And the sword shall devour thy 
young lions; 

And I will cut off thy prey from the 
earth, 

And the voice of thy messengers 
shall no more be heard. 

 

Woe to the bloody city! 

It is all full of lies and rapine; 

The prey departeth not. 

2Hark! the whip, and hark! the 
rattling of the wheels; 

And prancing horses, and bounding 
chariots; 

3The horseman charging, 

And the flashing sword, and the 
glittering spear; 

And a multitude of slain, and a heap 
of carcases; 

And there is no end of the corpses, 
and they stumble upon their 
corpses; 

4Because of the multitude of the 
harlotries of the well-favoured 
harlot, 

The mistress of witchcrafts, 

That selleth nations through her 
harlotries, 

And families through her 
witchcrafts. 

5Behold, I am against thee, saith the 
LORD of hosts, 

And I will uncover thy skirts upon 
thy face, 

And I will shew the nations thy 
nakedness, 

And the kingdoms thy shame. 

6And I will cast detestable things 
upon thee, and make thee vile, 

And will make thee as dung. 

7And it shall come to pass, that all 
they that look upon thee 

Shall flee from thee, 

And say: ‘Nineveh is laid waste; 

Who will bemoan her? 
3 




Whence shall I seek comforters for 
thee?’ 

8Art thou better than No-amon, 

That was situate among the rivers, 

That had the waters round about her; 

Whose rampart was the sea, and of 
the sea her wall? 

9Ethiopia and Egypt were thy 
strength, and it was infinite; 

Put and Lubim were thy helpers. 

10Yet was she carried away, 

She went into captivity; 

Her young children also were 
dashed in pieces 

At the head of all the streets; 

And they cast lots for her 
honourable men, 

And all her great men were bound in 
chains. 

11Thou also shalt be drunken, 

Thou shalt swoon; 

Thou also shalt seek a refuge 

Because of the enemy. 

 

12All thy fortresses shall be like fig-
trees with the first-ripe figs: 

If they be shaken, they fall into the 
mouth of the eater. 

13Behold, thy people in the midst of 
thee are women; 

The gates of thy land are set wide 
open unto thine enemies; 

The fire hath devoured thy bars. 

14Draw thee water for the siege, 

Strengthen thy fortresses; 

Go into the clay, and tread the 
mortar, 

Lay hold of the brickmould. 

15There shall the fire devour thee; 

The sword shall cut thee off, 

It shall devour thee like the canker-
worm; 

Make thyself many as the canker-
worm, 

Make thyself many as the locusts. 

16Thou hast multiplied thy 
merchants 

Above the stars of heaven; 

The canker-worm spreadeth itself, 
and flieth away. 

17Thy crowned are as the locusts, 

And thy marshals as the swarms of 
grasshoppers, 

Which camp in the walls in the cold 
day, 

But when the sun ariseth they flee 
away, 

And their place is not known where 
they are. 

18Thy shepherds slumber, O king of 
Assyria, 

Thy worthies are at rest; 

Thy people are scattered upon the 
mountains, 

And there is none to gather them. 

19There is no assuaging of thy hurt, 

Thy wound is grievous; 

All that hear the report of thee 

Clap the hands over thee; 

For upon whom hath not thy 
wickedness passed continually?
