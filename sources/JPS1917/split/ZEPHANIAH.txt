ZEPHANIAH 

 

The word of the LORD which came 
unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, 
the son of Gedaliah, the son of 
Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the 
days of Josiah the son of Amon, king 
of Judah. 

 

2I will utterly consume all things 
from off the face of the earth, 

Saith the LORD. 

3I will consume man and beast, 

I will consume the fowls of the 
heaven, and the fishes of the sea, 

And the stumblingblocks with the 
wicked; 

And I will cut off man from off the 
face of the earth, 

Saith the LORD. 

4And I will stretch out My hand 
upon Judah, 

And upon all the inhabitants of 
Jerusalem; 

And I will cut off the remnant of 
Baal from this place, 

And the name of the idolatrous 
priests with the priests; 

5And them that worship the host of 
heaven upon the housetops; 

And them that worship, that swear 
to the LORD 

And swear by Malcam; 

6Them also that are turned back 
from following the LORD; 

And those that have not sought the 
LORD, nor inquired after Him. 

 
1 




7Hold thy peace at the presence of 
the Lord GOD; 

For the day of the LORD is at hand, 

For the LORD hath prepared a 
sacrifice, 

He hath consecrated His guests. 

8And it shall come to pass in the day 
of the LORD’S sacrifice, 

That I will punish the princes, and 
the king’s sons, 

And all such as are clothed with 
foreign apparel. 

9In the same day also will I punish 
all those that leap over the 
threshold, 

That fill their master’s house with 
violence and deceit. 

 

10And in that day, saith the LORD, 
Hark! a cry from the fish gate, 

And a wailing from the second 
quarter, 

And a great crashing from the hills. 

11Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, 

For all the merchant people are 
undone; 

All they that were laden with silver 
are cut off. 

12And it shall come to pass at that 
time, 

That I will search Jerusalem with 
lamps; 

And I will punish the men that are 
settled on their lees, 

That say in their heart: 

‘The LORD will not do good, neither 
will He do evil.’ 

13Therefore their wealth shall 
become a booty, 

And their houses a desolation; 

Yea, they shall build houses, but 
shall not inhabit them, 

And they shall plant vineyards, but 
shall not drink the wine thereof. 

14The great day of the LORD is near, 

It is near and hasteth greatly, 

Even the voice of the day of the 
LORD, 

Wherein the mighty man crieth 
bitterly. 

15That day is a day of wrath, 

A day of trouble and distress, 

A day of wasteness and desolation, 

A day of darkness and gloominess, 

A day of clouds and thick darkness, 

16A day of the horn and alarm, 

Against the fortified cities, and 
against the high towers. 

17And I will bring distress upon 
men, 

That they shall walk like the blind, 

Because they have sinned against 
the LORD; 

And their blood shall be poured out 
as dust, 

And their flesh as dung. 

18Neither their silver nor their gold 

Shall be able to deliver them 

In the day of the LORD’S wrath; 

But the whole earth shall be 
devoured by the fire of His 
jealousy; 

For He will make and end, yea, a 
terrible end, 

Of all them that dwell in the earth. 

 

Gather yourselves together, yea, 
gather together, 2 




O shameless nation; 

2Before the decree bring forth 

The day when one passeth as the 
chaff, 

Before the fierce anger of the LORD 
come upon you, 

Before the day of the LORD’S anger 
come upon you. 

3Seek ye the LORD, all ye humble of 
the earth, 

That have executed His ordinance; 

Seek righteousness, seek humility. 

It may be ye shall be hid in the day 
of the LORD’S anger. 

4For Gaza shall be forsaken, 

And Ashkelon a desolation; 

They shall drive out Ashdod at the 
noonday, 

And Ekron shall be rooted up. 

5Woe unto the inhabitants of the 
sea-coast, 

The nation of the Cherethites! 

The word of the LORD is against you, 

O Canaan, the land of the 
Philistines; 

I will even destroy thee, that there 
shall be no inhabitant. 

6And the sea-coast shall be pastures, 

Even meadows for shepherds, and 
folds for flocks. 

7And it shall be a portion for the 
remnant of the house of Judah, 

Whereon they shall feed; 

In the houses of Ashkelon shall they 
lie down in the evening; 

For the LORD their God will 
remember them, 

And turn their captivity. 

 

8I have heard the taunt of Moab, 

And the revilings of the children of 
Ammon, 

Wherewith they have taunted My 
people, 

And spoken boastfully concerning 
their border. 

9Therefore as I live, 

Saith the LORD of hosts, the God of 
Israel: 

Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, 

And the children of Ammon as 
Gomorrah, 

Even the breeding-place of nettles, 
and saltpits, 

And a desolation, for ever; 

The residue of My people shall spoil 
them, 

And the remnant of My nation shall 
inherit them. 

10This shall they have for their pride, 

Because they have taunted and 
spoken boastfully 

Against the people of the LORD of 
hosts. 

11The LORD will be terrible unto 
them; 

For He will famish all the gods of 
the earth; 

Then shall all the isles of the nations 
worship Him, 

Every one from its place. 

12Ye Ethiopians also, 

Ye shall be slain by My sword. 

 

13And He will stretch out His hand 
against the north, 

And destroy Assyria; 


And will make Nineveh a 
desolation, 

And dry like the wilderness. 

14And all beasts of every kind 

Shall lie down in the midst of her in 
herds; 

Both the pelican and the bittern 

Shall lodge in the capitals thereof; 

Voices shall sing in the windows; 

Desolation shall be in the posts; 

For the cedar-work thereof shall be 
uncovered. 

15This is the joyous city 

That dwelt without care, 

That said in her heart: 

‘I am, and there is none else beside 
me’; 

How is she become a desolation, 

A place for beasts to lie down in! 

Every one that passeth by her 

Shall hiss, and wag his hand. 

 

Woe to her that is filthy and 
polluted, 

To the oppressing city! 

2She hearkened not the voice, 

She received not correction; 

She trusted not in the LORD, 

She drew not near to her God. 

3Her princes in the midst of her are 
roaring lions; 

Her judges are wolves of the desert, 

They leave not a bone for the 
morrow. 

4Her prophets are wanton 

And treacherous persons; 

Her priests have profaned that 
which is holy, 

They have done violence to the law. 

5The LORD who is righteous is in the 
midst of her, 

He will not do unrighteousness; 

Every morning doth He bring His 
right to light, 

It faileth not; 

But the unrighteous knoweth no 
shame. 

6I have cut off nations, 

Their corners are desolate; 

I have made their streets waste, 

So that none passeth by; 

Their cities are destroyed, so that 
there is no man, 

So that there is no inhabitant. 

7I said: ‘Surely thou wilt fear Me, 

Thou wilt receive correction; 

So her dwelling shall not be cut off, 

Despite all that I have visited upon 
her’; 

But they betimes corrupted all their 
doings. 

 

8Therefore wait ye for Me, saith the 
LORD, 

Until the day that I rise up to the 
prey; 

For My determination is to gather 
the nations, 

That I may assemble the kingdoms, 

To pour upon them Mine 
indignation, 

Even all My fierce anger; 

For all the earth shall be devoured 

With the fire of My jealousy. 

9For then will I turn to the peoples 

A pure language, 

That they may all call upon the 
name of the LORD, 
3 




To serve Him with one consent. 

10From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia 

Shall they bring My suppliants, 

Even the daughter of My dispersed, 

As Mine offering. 

11In that day shalt thou not be 
ashamed for all thy doings, 

Wherein thou hast transgressed 
against Me; 

For then I will take away out of the 
midst of thee 

Thy proudly exulting ones, 

And thou shalt no more be haughty 

In My holy mountain. 

12And I will leave in the midst of 
thee 

An afflicted and poor people, 

And they shall take refuge in the 
name of the LORD. 

13The remnant of Israel shall not do 
iniquity, 

Nor speak lies, 

Neither shall a deceitful tongue be 
found in their mouth; 

For they shall feed and lie down, 

And none shall make them afraid. 

 

14Sing, O daughter of Zion, 

Shout, O Israel; 

Be glad and rejoice with all the 
heart, 

O daughter of Jerusalem. 

15The LORD hath taken away thy 
judgments, 

He hath cast out thine enemy; 

The King of Israel, even the LORD, is 
in the midst of thee; 

Thou shalt not fear evil any more. 

16In that day it shall be said to 
Jerusalem: 

‘Fear thou not; 

O Zion, let not thy hands be slack. 

17The LORD thy God is in the midst 
of thee, 

A Mighty One who will save; 

He will rejoice over thee with joy, 

He will be silent in His love, 

He will joy over thee with singing.’ 

18I will gather them that are far from 
the appointed season, who are of 
thee, 

That hast borne the burden of 
reproach. 

19Behold, at that time 

I will deal with all them that afflict 
thee; 

And I will save her that is lame, 

And gather her that was driven 
away; 

And I will make them to be a praise 
and a name, 

Whose shame hath been in all the 
earth. 

20At that time will I bring you in, 

And at that time will I gather you; 

For I will make you to be a name 
and a praise 

Among all the peoples of the earth, 

When I turn your captivity before 
your eyes, 

Saith the LORD.
