JOB 

 

THERE was a man in the land of 
Uz, whose name was Job; and 
that man was whole-hearted and 
upright, and one that feared God, and 
shunned evil. 2And there were born 
unto him seven sons and three 
daughters. 3His possessions also were 
seven thousand sheep, and three 
thousand camels, and five hundred 
yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-
asses, and a very great household; so 
that this man was the greatest of all the 
children of the east. 4And his sons used 
to go and hold a feast in the house of 
each one upon his day; and they would 
send and invite their three sisters to eat 
and to drink with them. 5And it was so, 
when the days of their feasting were 
gone about, that Job sent and 
sanctified them, and rose up early in 
the morning, and offered burnt-
offerings according to the number of 
them all; for Job said: ‘It may be that 
my sons have sinned, and blasphemed 
God in their hearts.’ Thus did Job 
continually. 

6Now it fell upon a day, that the 
sons of God came to present 
themselves before the LORD, and aSatan 
came also among them. 7And the LORD 
said unto Satan: ‘Whence comest 
thou?’ Then Satan answered the LORD, 

a That is, the Adversary. 

and said: ‘From going to and fro in the 
earth, and from walking up and down 
in it.’ 8And the LORD said unto Satan: 
‘Hast thou considered My servant Job, 
that there is none like him in the earth, 
a whole-hearted and an upright man, 
one that feareth God, and shunneth 
evil?’ 9Then Satan answered the LORD, 
and said: ‘Doth Job fear God for 
nought? 10Hast not Thou made a hedge 
about him, and about his house, and 
about all that he hath, on every side? 
Thou hast blessed the work of his 
hands, and his possessions are 
increased in the land. 11But put forth 
Thy hand now, and touch all that he 
hath, surely he will blaspheme Thee to 
Thy face.’ 12And the LORD said unto 
Satan: ‘Behold, all that he hath is in 
thy power; only upon himself put not 
forth thy hand.’ So Satan went forth 
from the presence of the LORD. 

13And it fell on a day when his sons 
and his daughters were eating and 
drinking wine in their eldest brother’s 
house, 14that there came a messenger 
unto Job, and said: ‘The oxen were 
plowing, and the asses feeding beside 
them; 15and the Sabeans made a raid, 
and took them away; yea, they have 
slain the servants with the edge of the 
sword; and I only am escaped alone to 
tell thee.’ 16While he was yet speaking, 
there came also another, and said: ‘A 
1 




fire of God is fallen from heaven, and 
hath burned up the sheep, and the 
servants, and consumed them; and I 
only am escaped alone to tell thee.’ 
17While he was yet speaking, there 
came also another, and said: ‘The 
Chaldeans set themselves in three 
bands, and fell upon the camels, and 
have taken them away, yea, and slain 
the servants with the edge of the 
sword; and I only am escaped alone to 
tell thee.’ 18While he was yet speaking, 
there came also another, and said: 
‘Thy sons and thy daughters were 
eating and drinking wine in their eldest 
brother’s house; 19And, behold, there 
came a great wind from across the 
wilderness, and smote the four corners 
of the house, and it fell upon the young 
people, and they are dead; and I only 
am escaped alone to tell thee.’ 

20Then Job arose, and rent his 
mantle, and shaved his head, and fell 
down upon the ground, and 
worshipped; 21And he said; 

Naked came I out of my mother’s 
womb, 

And naked shall I return thither; 

The LORD gave, and the LORD hath 
taken away; 

Blessed be the name of the LORD. 

22For all this Job sinned not, nor 
ascribed aught unseemly to God. 

Again it fell upon a day, that the 
sons of God came to present 
themselves before the LORD, and Satan 
came also among them to present 
himself before the LORD. 2And the 
LORD said unto Satan: ‘From whence 
comest thou?’ And Satan answered the 
LORD, and said: ‘From going to and fro 
in the earth, and from walking up and 
down in it.’ 3And the LORD said unto 
Satan: ‘Hast thou considered my 
servant Job, that there is none like him 
in the earth, a whole-hearted and an 
upright man, one that feareth God, and 
shunneth evil? and he still holdeth fast 
his integrity, although thou didst move 
Me against him, to destroy him 
without cause.’ 4And Satan answered 
the LORD, and said: ‘Skin for skin, yea, 
all that a man hath will he give for his 
life. 5But put forth Thy hand now, and 
touch his bone and his flesh, surely he 
will blaspheme Thee to Thy face.’ 
6And the LORD said unto Satan: 
‘Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare 
his life.’ 

7So Satan went forth from the 
presence of the LORD, and smote Job 
with sore boils from the sole of his 
foot even unto his crown. 8And he took 
him a potsherd to scrape himself 
therewith; and he sat among the ashes. 
9Then said his wife unto him: ‘Dost 
thou still hold fast thine integrity? 
blaspheme God, and die.’ 10But he said 
unto her: ‘Thou speakest as one of the 
impious women speaketh. What? shall 
we receive good at the hand of God, 
and shall we not receive evil?’ For all 
this did not Job sin with his lips. 

11Now when Job’s three friends 
heard of all this evil that was come 
upon him, they came every one from 
his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, 
and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the 
2 




Naamathite; and they made an 
appointment together to come to 
bemoan him and to comfort him. 
12And when they lifted up their eyes 
afar off, and knew him not, they lifted 
up their voice, and wept; and they rent 
every one his mantle, and threw dust 
upon their heads toward heaven. 13So 
they sat down with him upon the 
ground seven days and seven nights, 
and none spoke a word unto him; for 
they saw that his grief was very great. 

 

After this opened Job his mouth, 
and cursed his day. 2And Job 
spoke, and said: 

3Let the day perish wherein I was 
born, 

And the night wherein it was said: 
‘A man-child is brought forth.’ 

4Let that day be darkness; 

Let not God inquire after it from 
above, 

Neither let the light shine upon it. 

5Let darkness and the shadow of 
death claim it for their own; 

Let a cloud dwell upon it; 

Let all that maketh black the day 
terrify it. 

6As for that night, let thick darkness 
seize upon it; 

Let it not rejoice among the days of 
the year; 

Let it not come into the number of 
the months. 

7Lo, let that night be desolate; 

Let no joyful voice come therein. 

8Let them curse it that curse the day, 

Who are ready to rouse up 
leviathan. 

9Let the stars of the twilight thereof 
be dark; 

Let it look for light, but have none; 

Neither let it behold the eyelids of 
the morning; 

10Because it shut not up the doors of 
my [mother’s] womb, 

Nor hid trouble from mine eyes. 

 

11Why died I not from the womb? 

Why did I not perish at birth? 

12Why did the knees receive me? 

And wherefore the breasts, that I 
should suck? 

13For now should I have lain still 
and been quiet; 

I should have slept; then had I been 
at rest— 

14With kings and counsellors of the 
earth, 

Who built up waste places for 
themselves; 

15Or with princes that had gold, 

Who filled their houses with silver; 

16Or as a hidden untimely birth I had 
not been; 

As infants that never saw light. 

17There the wicked cease from 
troubling; 

And there the weary are at rest. 

18There the prisoners are at ease 
together; 

They hear not the voice of the 
taskmaster. 

19The small and great are there 
alike; 
3 




And the servant is free from his 
master. 

 

20Wherewith is light given to him 
that is in misery, 

And life unto the bitter in soul— 

21Who long for death, but it cometh 
not; 

And dig for it more than for hid 
treasures; 

22Who rejoice unto exultation, 

And are glad, when they can find 
the grave?— 

23To a man whose way is hid, 

And whom God hath hedged in? 

24For my sighing cometh instead of 
my food, 

And my roarings are poured out like 
water. 

25For the thing which I did fear is 
come upon me, 

And that which I was afraid of hath 
overtaken me. 

26I was not at ease, neither was I 
quiet, 
Neither had I rest; but trouble came. 

 

Then answered Eliphaz the 
Temanite, and said: 

2If one venture a word unto thee, 
wilt thou be weary? 

But who can withhold himself from 
speaking? 

3Behold, thou hast instructed many, 

And thou hast strengthened the 
weak hands. 

4Thy words have upholden him that 
was falling, 

And thou hast strengthened the 
feeble knees. 

5But now it is come upon thee, and 
thou art weary; 

It toucheth thee, and thou art 
affrighted. 

6Is not thy fear of God thy 
confidence, 

And thy hope the integrity of thy 
ways? 

7Remember, I pray thee, who ever 
perished, being innocent? 

Or where were the upright cut off? 

8According as I have seen, they that 
plow iniquity, 

And sow mischief, reap the same. 

9By the breath of God they perish, 

And by the blast of His anger are 
they consumed. 

10The lion roareth, and the fierce 
lion howleth— 

Yet the teeth of the young lions are 
broken. 

11The old lion perisheth for lack of 
prey, 

And the whelps of the lioness are 
scattered abroad. 

 

12Now a word was secretly brought 
to me, 

And mine ear received a whisper 
thereof. 

13In thoughts from the visions of the 
night, 

When deep sleep falleth on men, 

14Fear came upon me, and 
trembling, 

And all my bones were made to 
shake. 
4 




15Then a spirit passed before my 
face, 

That made the hair of my flesh to 
stand up. 

16It stood still, but I could not 
discern the appearance thereof; 

A form was before mine eyes; I 
heard a still voice: 

17’Shall mortal man be just before 
God? 

Shall a man be pure before his 
Maker? 

18Behold, He putteth no trust in His 
servants, 

And His angels He chargeth with 
folly; 

19How much more them that dwell 
in houses of clay, 

Whose foundation is in the dust, 
who are crushed before the moth! 

20Betwixt morning and evening they 
are shattered; 

They perish for ever without any 
regarding it. 

21Is not their tent-cord plucked up 
within them? 

They die, and that without wisdom.’ 

 

Call now; is there any that will 
answer thee? 

And to which of the holy ones wilt 
thou turn? 

2For anger killeth the foolish man, 

And envy slayeth the silly one. 

3I have seen the foolish taking root; 

But suddenly I beheld his habitation 
cursed. 

4His children are far from safety, 

And are crushed in the gate, with 
none to deliver them. 

5Whose harvest the hungry eateth 
up, 

And taketh it even out of the thorns, 
and the snare gapeth for their 
substance. 

6For affliction cometh not forth 
from the dust, 

Neither doth trouble spring out of 
the ground; 

7But man is born unto trouble, 

As the sparks fly upward. 

 

8But as for me, I would seek unto 
God, 

And unto God would I commit my 
cause; 

9Who doeth great things and 
unsearchable, 

Marvellous things without number; 

10Who giveth rain upon the earth, 

And sendeth waters upon the fields; 

11So that He setteth up on high those 
that are low, 

And those that mourn are exalted to 
safety. 

12He frustrateth the devices of the 
crafty, 

So that their hands can perform 
nothing substantial. 

13He taketh the wise in their own 
craftiness; 

And the counsel of the wily is 
carried headlong. 

14They meet with darkness in the 
day-time, 

And grope at noonday as in the 
night. 
5 




15But He saveth from the sword of 
their mouth, 

Even the needy from the hand of the 
mighty. 

16So the poor hath hope, 

And iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 

 

17Behold, happy is the man whom 
God correcteth; 

Therefore despise not thou the 
chastening of the Almighty. 

18For He maketh sore, and bindeth 
up; 

He woundeth, and His hands make 
whole. 

19He will deliver thee in six 
troubles; 

Yea, in seven there shall no evil 
touch thee. 

20In famine He will redeem thee 
from death; 

And in war from the power of the 
sword. 

21Thou shalt be hid from the scourge 
of the tongue; 

Neither shalt thou be afraid of 
destruction when it cometh. 

22At destruction and famine thou 
shalt laugh; 

Neither shalt thou be afraid of the 
beasts of the earth. 

23For thou shalt be in league with 
the stones of the field; 

And the beasts of the field shall be 
at peace with thee. 

24And thou shalt know that thy tent 
is in peace; 

And thou shalt visit thy habitation, 
and shalt miss nothing. 

25Thou shalt know also that thy seed 
shall be great, 

And thine offspring as the grass of 
the earth. 

26Thou shalt come to thy grave in a 
ripe age, 

Like as a shock of corn cometh in in 
its season. 

27Lo this, we have searched it, 

So it is; hear it, and know thou it for 
thy good. 

 

Then Job answered and said: 

2Oh that my vexation were but 
weighed, 

And my calamity laid in the 
balances altogether! 

3For now it would be heavier than 
the sand of the seas; t 

Herefore are my words broken. 

4For the arrows of the Almighty are 
within me, 

The poison whereof my spirit 
drinketh up; 

The terrors of God do set 
themselves in array against me. 

5Doth the wild ass bray when he 
hath grass? 

Or loweth the ox over his fodder? 

6Can that which hath no savour be 
eaten without salt? 

Or is there any taste in the juice of 
mallows? 

7My soul refuseth to touch them; 

They are as the sickness of my flesh. 

 

8Oh that I might have my request, 

And that God would grant me the 
thing that I long for! 
6 




9Even that it would please God to 
crush me; 

That He would let loose His hand, 
and cut me off! 

10Then should I yet have comfort; 

Yea, I would exult in pain, though 
He spare not; 

For I have not denied the words of 
the Holy One. 

 

11What is my strength, that I should 
wait? 

And what is mine end, that I should 
be patient? 

12Is my strength the strength of 
stones? 

Or is my flesh of brass? 

13Is it that I have no help in me, 

And that sound wisdom is driven 
quite from me? 

 

14To him that is ready to faint 
kindness is due from his friend, 

Even to him that forsaketh the fear 
of the Almighty. 

15My brethren have dealt deceitfully 
as a brook, 

As the channel of brooks that 
overflow, 

16Which are black by reason of the 
ice, 

And wherein the snow hideth itself; 

17What time they wax warm, they 
vanish, 

When it is hot, they are consumed 
out of their place. 

18The paths of their way do wind, 

They go up into the waste, and are 
lost. 

19The caravans of Tema looked, 

The companies of Sheba waited for 
them— 

20They were ashamed because they 
had hoped; 

They came thither, and were 
confounded. 

21For now ye are become His; 

Ye see a terror, and are afraid. 

22Did I say: ‘Give unto me’? 

Or: ‘Offer a present for me of your 
substance’? 

23or: ‘Deliver me from the 
adversary’s hand’? 

Or: ‘Redeem me from the hand of 
the oppressors’? 

 

24Teach me, and I will hold my 
peace; 

And cause me to understand 
wherein I have erred. 

25How forcible are words of 
uprightness! 

But what doth your arguing argue? 

26Do ye hold words to be an 
argument, 

But the speeches of one that is 
desperate to be wind? 

27Yea, ye would cast lots upon the 
fatherless, 

And dig a pit for your friend. 

28Now therefore be pleased to look 
upon me; 

For surely I shall not lie to your 
face. 

29Return, I pray you, let there be no 
injustice; 

Yea, return again, my cause is 
righteous. 


30Is there injustice on my tongue? 

Cannot my taste discern crafty 
devices? 

 

Is there not a time of service to 
man upon earth? 

And are not his days like the days of 
a hireling? 

2As a servant that eagerly longeth 
for the shadow, 

And as a hireling that looketh for his 
wages; 

3So am I made to possess—months 
of vanity, 

And wearisome nights are appointed 
to me. 

4When I lie down, I say: ‘When 
shall I arise?’ 

But the night is long, and I am full 
of tossings to and fro unto the 
dawning of the day. 

5My flesh is clothed with worms and 
clods of dust; 

My skin closeth up and breaketh out 
afresh. 

6My days are swifter than a 
weaver’s shuttle, 

And are spent without hope. 

7O remember that my life is a 
breath; 

Mine eye shall no more see good. 

8The eye of him that seeth me shall 
behold me no more; 

While Thine eyes are upon me, I am 
gone. 

9As the cloud is consumed and 
vanisheth away, 

So he that goeth down to the grave 
shall come up no more. 

10He shall return no more to his 
house, 

Neither shall his place know him 
any more. 

 

11Therefore I will not refrain my 
mouth; 

I will speak in the anguish of my 
spirit; 

I will complain in the bitterness of 
my soul. 

12Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, 

That Thou settest a watch over me? 

13When I say: ‘My bed shall comfort 
me, 

My couch shall ease my complaint’; 

14Then Thou scarest me with 
dreams, 

And terrifiest me through visions; 

15So that my soul chooseth 
strangling, 

And death rather than these my 
bones. 

16I loathe it; I shall not live alway; 

Let me alone; for my days are 
vanity. 

17What is man, that Thou shouldest 
magnify him, 

And that Thou shouldest set Thy 
heart upon him, 

18And that Thou shouldest 
remember him every morning, 

And try him every moment? 

19How long wilt Thou not look away 
from me, 

Nor let me alone till I swallow down 
my spittle? 

20If I have sinned, what do I unto 
Thee, O Thou watcher of men? 
7 




Why hast Thou set me as a mark for 
Thee, 

So that I am a burden to myself? 

21And why dost Thou not pardon my 
transgression, 

And take away mine iniquity? 

For now shall I lie down in the dust; 

And Thou wilt seek me, but I shall 
not be. 

 

Then answered Bildad the 
Shuhite, and said: 

2How long wilt thou speak these 
things, 

Seeing that the words of thy mouth 
are as a mighty wind? 

3Doth God pervert judgment? 

Or doth the Almighty pervert 
justice? 

4If thy children sinned against Him, 

He delivered them into the hand of 
their transgression. 

5If thou wouldest seek earnestly 
unto God, 

And make thy supplication to the 
Almighty; 

6If thou wert pure and upright; 

Surely now He would awake for 
thee, 

And make the habitation of thy 
righteousness prosperous. 

7And though thy beginning was 
small, 

Yet thy end should greatly increase. 

 

8For inquire, I pray thee, of the 
former generation, 

And apply thyself to that which their 
fathers have searched out— 

9For we are but of yesterday, and 
know nothing, 

Because our days upon earth are a 
shadow— 

10Shall not they teach thee, and tell 
thee, 

And utter words out of their heart? 

11Can the rush shoot up without 
mire? 

Can the reed-grass grow without 
water? 

12Whilst it is yet in its greenness, 
and not cut down, 

It withereth before any other herb. 

13So are the paths of all that forget 
God; 

And the hope of the godless man 
shall perish; 

14Whose confidence is gossamer, 

And whose trust is a spider’s web. 

15He shall lean upon his house, but it 
shall not stand; 

He shall hold fast thereby, but it 
shall not endure. 

16He is green before the sun, 

And his shoots go forth over his 
garden. 

17His roots are wrapped about the 
heap, 

He beholdeth the place of stones. 

18If he be destroyed from his place, 

Then it shall deny him: ‘I have not 
seen thee.’ 

19Behold, this is the joy of his way, 

And out of the earth shall others 
spring. 

20Behold, God will not cast away an 
innocent man, 
8 




Neither will He uphold the evil-
doers; 

21Till He fill thy mouth with 
laughter, 

And thy lips with shouting. 

22They that hate thee shall be 
clothed with shame; 

And the tent of the wicked shall be 
no more. 

 

Then Job answered and said: 

2Of a truth I know that it is so; 

And how can man be just with God? 

3If one should desire to contend with 
Him, 

He could not answer Him one of a 
thousand. 

4He is wise in heart, and mighty in 
strength; 

Who hath hardened himself against 
Him, and prospered? 

5Who removeth the mountains, and 
they know it not, 

When He overturneth them in His 
anger. 

6Who shaketh the earth out of her 
place, 

And the pillars thereof tremble. 

7Who commandeth the sun, and it 
riseth not; 

And sealeth up the stars. 

8Who alone stretcheth out the 
heavens, 

And treadeth upon the waves of the 
sea. 

9Who maketh the Bear, Orion, and 
the Pleiades, 

And the chambers of the south. 

10Who doeth great things past 
finding out; 

Yea, marvellous things without 
number. 

11Lo, He goeth by me, and I see Him 
not. 

He passeth on also, but I perceive 
Him not. 

12Behold, He snatcheth away, who 
can hinder Him? 

Who will say unto Him: ‘What 
doest Thou?’ 

13God will not withdraw His anger; 

The helpers of Rahab did stoop 
under Him. 

 

14How much less shall I answer 
Him, 

And choose out my arguments with 
Him? 

15Whom, though I were righteous, 
yet would I not answer; 

I would make supplication to Him 
that contendeth with me. 

16If I had called, and He had 
answered me; 

Yet would I not believe that He 
would hearken unto my voice— 

17He that would break me with a 
tempest, 

And multiply my wounds without 
cause; 

18That would not suffer me to take 
my breath, 

But fill me with bitterness. 

19If it be a matter of strength, lo, He 
is mighty! 

And if of justice, who will appoint 
me a time? 
9 




20Though I be righteous, mine own 
mouth shall condemn me; 

Though I be innocent, He shall 
prove me perverse. 

21I am innocent—I regard not 
myself, 

I despise my life. 

22It is all one—therefore I say: 

He destroyeth the innocent and the 
wicked. 

23If the scourge slay suddenly, 

He will mock at the calamity of the 
guiltless. 

24The earth is given into the hand of 
the wicked; 

He covereth the faces of the judges 
thereof; 

If it be not He, who then is it? 

25Now my days are swifter than a 
runner; 

They flee away, they see no good. 

26They are passed away as the swift 
ships; 

As the vulture that swoopeth on the 
prey. 

27If I say: ‘I will forget my 
complaint, 

I will put off my sad countenance, 
and be of good cheer’, 

28I am afraid of all my pains, 

I know that Thou wilt not hold me 
guiltless. 

29I shall be condemned; 

Why then do I labour in vain? 

30If I wash myself with snow water, 

And make my hands never so clean; 

31Yet wilt Thou plunge me in the 
ditch, 

And mine own clothes shall abhor 
me. 

32For He is not a man, as I am, that I 
should answer Him, 

That we should come together in 
judgment. 

33There is no arbiter betwixt us, 

That might lay his hand upon us 
both. 

34Let Him take His rod away from 
me, 

And let not His terror make me 
afraid; 

5Then would I speak, and not fear 
Him; 

For I am not so with myself. 

 

My soul is weary of my life; 

I will give free course to my 
complaint; 

I will speak in the bitterness of my 
soul. 

2I will say unto God: Do not 
condemn me; 

Make me know wherefore Thou 
contendest with me. 

3Is it good unto Thee that Thou 
shouldest oppress, 

That Thou shouldest despise the 
work of Thy hands, 

And shine upon the counsel of the 
wicked? 

4Hast Thou eyes of flesh? 

Or seest Thou as man seeth? 

5Are Thy days as the days of man, 

Or Thy years as a man’s days, 

6That Thou inquirest after mine 
iniquity, 

And searchest after my sin, 
10 




7Although Thou knowest that I shall 
not be condemned; 

And there is none that can deliver 
out of Thy hand? 

8Thy hands have framed me and 
fashioned me 

Together round about; yet Thou dost 
destroy me! 

9Remember, I beseech Thee, that 
Thou hast fashioned me as clay; 

And wilt Thou bring me into dust 
again? 

10Hast Thou not poured me out as 
milk, 

And curdled me like cheese? 

11Thou hast clothed me with skin 
and flesh, 

And knit me together with bones 
and sinews. 

12Thou hast granted me life and 
favour, 

And Thy providence hath preserved 
my spirit. 

13Yet these things Thou didst hide in 
Thy heart; 

I know that this is with Thee; 

14If I sin, then Thou markest me, 

And Thou wilt not acquit me from 
mine iniquity. 

15If I be wicked, woe unto me; 

And if I be righteous, yet shall I not 
lift up my head— 

Being filled with ignominy 

And looking upon mine affliction. 

16And if it exalt itself, Thou huntest 
me as a lion; 

And again Thou showest Thyself 
marvellous upon me. 

17Thou renewest Thy witnesses 
against me, 

And increasest Thine indignation 
upon me; 

Host succeeding host against me. 

 

18Wherefore then hast Thou brought 
me forth out of the womb? 

Would that I had perished, and no 
eye had seen me! 

19I should have been as though I had 
not been; 

I should have been carried from the 
womb to the grave. 

20Are not my days few? Cease then, 

And let me alone, that I may take 
comfort a little, 

21Before I go whence I shall not 
return, 

Even to the land of darkness and of 
the shadow of death; 

22A land of thick darkness, as 
darkness itself; 

A land of the shadow of death, 
without any order, 

And where the light is as darkness. 

 

Then answered Zophar the 
Naamathite, and said: 

2Should not the multitude of words 
be answered? 

And should a man full of talk be 
accounted right? 

3Thy boastings have made men hold 
their peace, 

And thou hast mocked, with none to 
make thee ashamed; 

4And thou hast said: ‘My doctrine is 
pure, 
11 




And I am clean in Thine eyes.’ 

5But oh that God would speak, 

And open His lips against thee; 

6And that He would tell thee the 
secrets of wisdom, 

That sound wisdom is manifold! 

Know therefore that God exacteth of 
thee less than thine iniquity 
deserveth. 

 

7Canst thou find out the deep things 
of God? 

Canst thou attain unto the purpose 
of the Almighty? 

8It is high as heaven; what canst 
thou do? 

Deeper than the nether-world; what 
canst thou know? 

9The measure thereof is longer than 
the earth, 

And broader than the sea. 

10If He pass by, and shut up, 

Or gather in, then who can hinder 
Him? 

11For He knoweth base men; 

And when He seeth iniquity, will He 
not then consider it? 

12But an empty man will get 
understanding, 

When a wild ass’s colt is born a 
man. 

 

13If thou set thy heart aright, 

And stretch out thy hands toward 
Him— 

14If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far 
away, 

And let not unrighteousness dwell in 
thy tents— 

15Surely then shalt thou lift up thy 
face without spot; 

Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt 
not fear; 

16For thou shalt forget thy misery; 

Thou shalt remember it as waters 
that are passed away; 

17And thy life shall be clearer than 
the noonday; 

Though there be darkness, it shall be 
as the morning. 

18And thou shalt be secure, because 
there is hope; 

Yea, thou shalt look about thee, and 
shalt take thy rest in safety. 

19Also thou shalt lie down, and none 
shall make thee afraid; 

Yea, many shall make suit unto 
thee. 

20But the eyes of the wicked shall 
fail, 

And they shall have no way to flee, 

And their hope shall be the drooping 
of the soul. 

 

Then Job answered and said: 

2No doubt but ye are the 
people, 

And wisdom shall die with you. 

3But I have understanding as well as 
you; 

I am not inferior to you; 

Yea, who knoweth not such things 
as these? 

4I am as one that is a laughing-stock 
to his neighbour, 

A man that called upon God, 

And He answered him; 
12 




The just, the innocent man is a 
laughing-stock, 

5A contemptible brand in the 
thought of him that is at ease, 

A thing ready for them whose foot 
slippeth. 

6The tents of robbers prosper, 

And they that provoke God are 
secure, 

In whatsoever God bringeth into 
their hand. 

 

7But ask now the beasts, and they 
shall teach thee; 

And the fowls of the air, and they 
shall tell thee; 

8Or speak to the earth, and it shall 
teach thee; 

And the fishes of the sea shall 
declare unto thee; 

9Who knoweth not among all these, 

That the hand of the LORD hath 
wrought this? 

10In whose hand is the soul of every 
living thing, 

And the breath of all mankind.— 

11Doth not the ear try words, 

Even as the palate tasteth its food? 

12Is wisdom with aged men, 

And understanding in length of 
days?— 

13With Him is wisdom and might; 

He hath counsel and understanding. 

14Behold, He breaketh down, and it 
cannot be built again; 

He shutteth up a man, and there can 
be no opening. 

15Behold, He withholdeth the 
waters, and they dry up; 

Also He sendeth them out, and they 
overturn the earth. 

16With Him is strength and sound 
wisdom; 

The deceived and the deceiver are 
His. 

17He leadeth counsellors away 
stripped, 

And judges maketh He fools. 

18He looseth the bond of kings, 

And bindeth their loins with a 
girdle. 

19He leadeth priests away stripped, 

And overthroweth the mighty. 

20He removeth the speech of men of 
trust, 

And taketh away the sense of the 
elders. 

21He poureth contempt upon princes, 

And looseth the belt of the strong. 

22He uncovereth deep things out of 
darkness, 

And bringeth out to light the shadow 
of death. 

23He increaseth the nations, and 
destroyeth them; 

He enlargeth the nations, and 
leadeth them away. 

24He taketh away the heart of the 
chiefs of the people of the land, 

And causeth them to wander in a 
wilderness where there is no way. 

25They grope in the dark without 
light, 

And He maketh them to stagger like 
a drunken man. 

 

Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, 

Mine ear hath heard and 13 




 understood it. 

2What ye know, do I know also; 

I am not inferior unto you. 

3Notwithstanding I would speak to 
the Almighty, 

And I desire to reason with God. 

4But ye are plasterers of lies, 

Ye are all physicians of no value. 

5Oh that ye would altogether hold 
your peace! 

And it would be your wisdom. 

6Hear now my reasoning, 

And hearken to the pleadings of my 
lips. 

7Will ye speak unrighteously for 
God, 

And talk deceitfully for Him? 

8Will ye show Him favour? 

Will ye contend for God? 

9Would it be good that He should 
search you out? 

Or as one mocketh a man, will ye 
mock Him? 

10He will surely reprove you, 

If ye do secretly show favour. 

11Shall not His majesty terrify you, 

And His dread fall upon you? 

12Your memorials shall be like unto 
ashes, 

Your eminences to eminences of 
clay. 

 

13Hold your peace, let me alone, that 
I may speak, 

And let come on me what will. 

14Wherefore? I will take my flesh in 
my teeth, 

And put my life in my hand. 

15Though He slay me, yet will I trust 
in Him; 

But I will argue my ways before 
Him. 

16This also shall be my salvation, 

That a hypocrite cannot come before 
Him. 

17Hear diligently my speech, 

And let my declaration be in your 
ears. 

18Behold now, I have ordered my 
cause; 

I know that I shall be justified. 

19Who is he that will contend with 
me? 

For then would I hold my peace and 
die. 

 

20Only do not two things unto me, 

Then will I not hide myself from 
Thee: 

21Withdraw Thy hand far from me; 

And let not Thy terror make me 
afraid. 

22Then call Thou, and I will answer; 

Or let me speak, and answer Thou 
me. 

23How many are mine iniquities and 
sins? 

Make me to know my transgression 
and my sin. 

24Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, 

And holdest me for Thine enemy? 

25Wilt Thou harass a driven leaf? 

And wilt Thou pursue the dry 
stubble? 

26That Thou shouldest write bitter 
things against me, 


And make me to inherit the 
iniquities of my youth. 

27Thou puttest my feet also in the 
stocks, 

And lookest narrowly unto all my 
paths; 

Thou drawest Thee a line about the 
soles of my feet; 

28Though I am like a wine-skin that 
consumeth, 

Like a garment that is moth-eaten. 

 

Man that is born of a woman 

Is of few days, and full of 
trouble. 

2He cometh forth like a flower, and 
withereth; 

He fleeth also as a shadow, and 
continueth not. 

3And dost Thou open Thine eyes 
upon such a one, 

And bringest me into judgment with 
Thee? 

4Who can bring a clean thing out of 
an unclean? not one. 

5Seeing his days are determined, 

The number of his months is with 
Thee, 

And Thou hast appointed his bounds 
that he cannot pass; 

6Look away from him, that he may 
rest, 

Till he shall accomplish, as a 
hireling, his day. 

 

7For there is hope of a tree, 

If it be cut down, that it will sprout 
again, 

And that the tender branch thereof 
will not cease. 

8Though the root thereof wax old in 
the earth, 

And the stock thereof die in the 
ground; 

9Yet through the scent of water it 
will bud, 

And put forth boughs like a plant. 

10But man dieth, and lieth low; 

Yea, man perisheth, and where is 
he? 

11As the waters fail from the sea, 

And the river is drained dry; 

12So man lieth down and riseth not; 

Till the heavens be no more, they 
shall not awake, 

Nor be roused out of their sleep. 

13Oh that Thou wouldest hide me in 
the nether-world, 

That Thou wouldest keep me secret, 
until Thy wrath be past, 

That Thou wouldest appoint me a 
set time, and remember me!— 

14If a man die, may he live again? 

All the days of my service would I 
wait, till my relief should come— 

15Thou wouldest call, and I would 
answer Thee; 

Thou wouldest have a desire to the 
work of Thy hands. 

16But now Thou numberest my 
steps, 

Thou dost not even wait for my sin; 

17My transgression is sealed up in a 
bag, 

And Thou heapest up mine iniquity. 

18And surely the mountain falling 
crumbleth away, 
14 




And the rock is removed out of its 
place; 

19The waters wear the stones; 

The overflowings thereof wash 
away the dust of the earth; 

So Thou destroyest the hope of man. 

20Thou prevailest for ever against 
him, and he passeth; 

Thou changest his countenance, and 
sendest him away. 

21His sons come to honour, and he 
knoweth it not; 

And they are brought low, but he 
regardeth them not. 

22But his flesh grieveth for him, 

And his soul mourneth over him. 

 

Then answered Eliphaz the 
Temanite, and said: 

2Should a wise man make answer 
with windy knowledge, 

And fill his belly with the east 
wind? 

3Should he reason with unprofitable 
talk, 

Or with speeches wherewith he can 
do no good? 

4Yea, thou doest away with fear, 

And impairest devotion before God. 

5For thine iniquity teacheth thy 
mouth, 

And thou choosest the tongue of the 
crafty. 

6Thine own mouth condemneth 
thee, and not I; 

Yea, thine own lips testify against 
thee. 

 

7Art thou the first man that was 
born? 

Or wast thou brought forth before 
the hills? 

8Dost thou hearken in the council of 
God? 

And dost thou restrain wisdom to 
thyself? 

9What knowest thou, that we know 
not? 

What understandest thou, which is 
not in us? 

10With us are both the gray-headed 
and the very aged men, 

Much older than thy father. 

11Are the consolations of God too 
small for thee, 

And the word that dealeth gently 
with thee? 

12Why doth thy heart carry thee 
away? 

And why do thine eyes wink? 

13That thou turnest thy spirit against 
God, 

And lettest such words go out of thy 
mouth. 

14What is man, that he should be 
clean? 

And he that is born of a woman, that 
he should be righteous? 

15Behold, He putteth no trust in His 
holy ones; 

Yea, the heavens are not clean in 
His sight. 

16How much less one that is 
abominable and impure, 

Man who drinketh iniquity like 
water! 

 
15 




17I will tell thee, hear thou me; 

And that which I have seen I will 
declare— 

18Which wise men have told 

From their fathers, and have not hid 
it; 

19Unto whom alone the land was 
given, 

And no stranger passed among 
them. 

20The wicked man travaileth with 
pain all his days, 

Even the number of years that are 
laid up for the oppressor. 

21A sound of terrors is in his ears: 

In prosperity the destroyer shall 
come upon him. 

22He believeth not that he shall 
return out of darkness, 

And he is waited for of the sword. 

23He wandereth abroad for bread: 
‘Where is it?’ 

He knoweth that the day of darkness 
is ready at his hand. 

24Distress and anguish overwhelm 
him; 

They prevail against him, as a king 
ready to the battle. 

25Because he hath stretched out his 
hand against God, 

And behaveth himself proudly 
against the Almighty; 

26He runneth upon him with a stiff 
neck, 

With the thick bosses of his 
bucklers. 

27Because he hath covered his face 
with his fatness, 

And made collops of fat on his 
loins; 

28And he hath dwelt in desolate 
cities, 

In houses which no man would 
inhabit, 

Which were ready to become heaps. 

29He shall not be rich, neither shall 
his substance continue, 

Neither shall their produce bend to 
the earth. 

30He shall not depart out of 
darkness; 

The flame shall dry up his branches, 

And by the breath of His mouth 
shall he go away. 

31Let him not trust in vanity, 
deceiving himself; 

For vanity shall be his recompense. 

32It shall be accomplished before his 
time, 

And his branch shall not be leafy. 

33He shall shake off his unripe grape 
as the vine, 

And shall cast off his flower as the 
olive. 

34For the company of the godless 
shall be desolate, 

And fire shall consume the tents of 
bribery. 

35They conceive mischief, and bring 
forth iniquity, 

And their belly prepareth deceit. 

 

Then Job answered and said: 

2I have heard many such 
things; 

Sorry comforters are ye all. 

3Shall windy words have an end? 
16 




Or what provoketh thee that thou 
answerest? 

4I also could speak as ye do; 

If your soul were in my soul’s stead, 

I could join words together against 
you, 

And shake my head at you. 

5I would strengthen you with my 
mouth, 

And the moving of my lips would 
assuage your grief. 

 

6Though I speak, my pain is not 
assuaged; 

And though I forbear, what am I 
eased? 

7But now He hath made me weary; 

Thou hast made desolate all my 
company. 

8And Thou hast shrivelled me up, 
which is a witness against me; 

And my leanness riseth up against 
me, it testifieth to my face. 

9He hath torn me in His wrath, and 
hated me; 

He hath gnashed upon me with His 
teeth; 

Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes 
upon me. 

10They have gaped upon me with 
their mouth; 

They have smitten me upon the 
cheek scornfully; 

They gather themselves together 
against me. 

11God delivereth me to the ungodly, 

And casteth me into the hands of the 
wicked. 

12I was at ease, and He broke me 
asunder; 

Yea, He hath taken me by the neck, 
and dashed me to pieces; 

He hath also set me up for His mark. 

13His archers compass me round 
about, 

He cleaveth my reins asunder, and 
doth not spare; 

He poureth out my gall upon the 
ground. 

14He breaketh me with breach upon 
breach; 

He runneth upon me like a giant. 

15I have sewed sackcloth upon my 
skin, 

And have laid my horn in the dust. 

16My face is reddened with weeping, 

And on my eyelids is the shadow of 
death; 

17Although there is no violence in 
my hands, 

And my prayer is pure. 

18O earth, cover not thou my blood, 

And let my cry have no resting-
place. 

19Even now, behold, my Witness is 
in heaven, 

And He that testifieth of me is on 
high. 

20Mine inward thoughts are my 
intercessors, 

Mine eye poureth out tears unto 
God; 

21That He would set aright a man 
contending with God, 

As a son of man setteth aright his 
neighbour! 


22For the years that are few are 
coming on, 

And I shall go the way whence I 
shall not return. 

My spirit is consumed, my 
days are extinct, 

The grave is ready for me. 

2Surely there are mockers with me, 

And mine eye abideth in their 
provocation. 

3Give now a pledge, be surety for 
me with Thyself; 

Who else is there that will strike 
hands with me? 

4For Thou hast hid their heart from 
understanding; 

Therefore shalt Thou not exalt them. 

5He that denounceth his friends for 
the sake of flattery, 

Even the eyes of his children shall 
fail. 

 

6He hath made me also a byword of 
the people; 

And I am become one in whose face 
they spit. 

7Mine eye also is dimmed by reason 
of vexation, 

And all my members are as a 
shadow. 

8Upright men are astonished at this, 

And the innocent stirreth up himself 
against the godless. 

9Yet the righteous holdeth on his 
way, 

And he that hath clean hands waxeth 
stronger and stronger. 

10But as for you all, do ye return, 
and come now; 

And I shall not find a wise man 
among you. 

11My days are past, my purposes are 
broken off, 

Even the thoughts of my heart. 

12They change the night into day; 

The light is short because of 
darkness. 

13If I look for the nether-world as 
my house; 

If I have spread my couch in the 
darkness; 

14If I have said to corruption: ‘Thou 
art my father’, 

To the worm: ‘Thou art my mother, 
and my sister’; 

15Where then is my hope? 

And as for my hope, who shall see 
it? 

16They shall go down to the bars of 
the nether-world, 

When we are at rest together in the 
dust. 

 

Then answered Bildad the 
Shuhite, and said: 

2How long will ye lay snares for 
words? 

Consider, and afterwards we will 
speak. 

3Wherefore are we counted as 
beasts, 

And reputed dull in your sight? 

4Thou that tearest thyself in thine 
anger, 

Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? 

Or shall the rock be removed out of 
its place? 

 
17 

18 




5Yea, the light of the wicked shall 
be put out, 

And the spark of his fire shall not 
shine. 

6The light shall be dark in his tent, 

And his lamp over him shall be put 
out. 

7The steps of his strength shall be 
straitened, 

And his own counsel shall cast him 
down. 

8For he is cast into a net by his own 
feet, 

And he walketh upon the toils. 

9A gin shall take him by the heel, 

And a snare shall lay hold on him. 

10A noose is hid for him in the 
ground, 

And a trap for him in the way. 

11Terrors shall overwhelm him on 
every side, 

And shall entrap him at his feet. 

12His trouble shall be ravenous, 

And calamity shall be ready for his 
fall. 

13It shall devour the members of his 
body, 

Yea, the first-born of death shall 
devour his members. 

14That wherein he trusteth shall be 
plucked out of his tent; 

And he shall be brought to the king 
of terrors. 

15There shall dwell in his tent that 
which is none of his; 

Brimstone shall be scattered upon 
his habitation. 

16His roots shall dry up beneath, 

And above shall his branch wither. 

17His remembrance shall perish 
from the earth, 

And he shall have no name abroad. 

18He shall be driven from light into 
darkness, 

And chased out of the world. 

19He shall have neither son nor son’s 
son among his people, 

Nor any remaining in his dwellings. 

20They that come after shall be 
astonished at his day, 

As they that went before are 
affrighted. 

21Surely such are the dwellings of 
the wicked, 

And this is the place of him that 
knoweth not God. 

 

Then Job answered and said: 

2How long will ye vex my 
soul, 

And crush me with words? 

3These ten times have ye reproached 
me; 

Ye are not ashamed that ye deal 
harshly with me. 

4And be it indeed that I have erred, 

Mine error remaineth with myself. 

5If indeed ye will magnify 
yourselves against me, 

And plead against me my reproach; 

6Know now that God hath subverted 
my cause, 

And hath compassed me with His 
net. 

7Behold, I cry out: ‘Violence! ’ but I 
am not heard; 

I cry aloud, but there is no justice. 
19 




8He hath fenced up my way that I 
cannot pass, 

And hath set darkness in my paths. 

9He hath stripped me of my glory, 

And taken the crown from my head. 

10He hath broken me down on every 
side, and I am gone; 

And my hope hath He plucked up 
like a tree. 

11He hath also kindled His wrath 
against me, 

And He counteth me unto Him as 
one of His adversaries. 

12His troops come on together, 

And cast up their way against me, 

And encamp round about my tent. 

13He hath put my brethren far from 
me, 

And mine acquaintance are wholly 
estranged from me. 

14My kinsfolk have failed, 

And my familiar friends have 
forgotten me. 

15They that dwell in my house, and 
my maids, count me for a 
stranger; 

I am become an alien in their sight. 

16I call unto my servant, and he 
giveth me no answer, 

Though I entreat him with my 
mouth. 

17My breath is abhorred of my wife, 

And I am loathsome to the children 
of my tribe. 

18Even urchins despised me; 

If I arise, they speak against me. 

19All my intimate friends abhor me; 

And they whom I loved are turned 
against me. 

20My bone cleaveth to my skin and 
to my flesh, 

And I am escaped with the skin of 
my teeth. 

 

21Have pity upon me, have pity upon 
me, O ye my friends; 

For the hand of God hath touched 
me. 

22Why do ye persecute me as God, 

And are not satisfied with my flesh? 

23Oh that my words were now 
written! 

Oh that they were inscribed in a 
book! 

24That with an iron pen and lead 

They were graven in the rock for 
ever! 

25But as for me, I know that my 
Redeemer liveth, 

And that He will witness at the last 
upon the dust; 

26And when after my skin this is 
destroyed, 

Then without my flesh shall I see 
God; 

27Whom I, even I, shall see for 
myself, 

And mine eyes shall behold, and not 
another’s. 

My reins are consumed within me. 

28If ye say: ‘How we will persecute 
him! ’ 

Seeing that the root of the matter is 
found in me; 

29Be ye afraid of the sword; 

For wrath bringeth the punishments 
of the sword, 


That ye may know there is a 
judgment. 

 

Then answered Zophar the 
Naamathite, and said: 

2Therefore do my thoughts give 
answer to me, 

Even by reason of mine agitation 
that is in me. 

3I have heard the reproof which 
putteth me to shame, 

But out of my understanding my 
spirit answereth me. 

 

4Knowest thou not this of old time, 

Since man was placed upon earth, 

5That the triumphing of the wicked 
is short, 

And the joy of the godless but for a 
moment? 

6Though his excellency mount up to 
the heavens, 

And his head reach unto the clouds; 

7Yet he shall perish for ever like his 
own dung; 

They that have seen him shall say: 
‘Where is he?’ 

8He shall fly away as a dream, and 
shall not be found; 

Yea, he shall be chased away as a 
vision of the night. 

9The eye which saw him shall see 
him no more; 

Neither shall his place any more 
behold him. 

10His children shall appease the 
poor, 

And his hands shall restore his 
wealth. 

11His bones are full of his youth, 

But it shall lie down with him in the 
dust. 

12Though wickedness be sweet in 
his mouth, 

Though he hide it under his tongue; 

13Though he spare it, and will not let 
it go, 

But keep it still within his mouth; 

14Yet his food in his bowels is 
turned, 

It is the gall of asps within him. 

15He hath swallowed down riches, 
and he shall vomit them up again; 

God shall cast them out of his belly. 

16He shall suck the poison of asps; 

The viper’s tongue shall slay him. 

17He shall not look upon the rivers, 

The flowing streams of honey and 
curd. 

18That which he laboured for shall 
he give back, and shall not 
swallow it down; 

According to the substance that he 
hath gotten, he shall not rejoice. 

19For he hath oppressed and 
forsaken the poor; 

He hath violently taken away a 
house, and he shall not build it 
up. 

20Because he knew no quietness 
within him, 

In his greed he suffered nought to 
escape, 

21There was nothing left that he 
devoured not— 

Therefore his prosperity shall not 
endure. 
20 




22In the fulness of his sufficiency he 
shall be in straits; 

The hand of every one that is in 
misery shall come upon him. 

23It shall be for the filling of his 
belly; 

He shall cast the fierceness of His 
wrath upon him, 

And shall cause it to rain upon him 
into his flesh. 

24If he flee from the iron weapon, 

The bow of brass shall strike him 
through. 

25He draweth it forth, and it cometh 
out of his body; 

Yea, the glittering point cometh out 
of his gall; 

Terrors are upon him. 

26All darkness is laid up for his 
treasures; 

A fire not blown by man shall 
consume him; 

It shall go ill with him that is left in 
his tent. 

27The heavens shall reveal his 
iniquity, 

And the earth shall rise up against 
him. 

28The increase of his house shall 
depart, 

His goods shall flow away in the 
day of his wrath. 

29This is the portion of a wicked 
man from God, 

And the heritage appointed unto him 
by God. 

 

Then Job answered and said: 

2Hear diligently my speech; 

And let this be your consolations. 

3Suffer me, that I may speak; 

And after that I have spoken, mock 
on. 

4As for me, is my complaint to man? 

Or why should I not be impatient? 

5Turn unto me, and be astonished, 

And lay your hand upon your 
mouth. 

6Even when I remember I am 
affrighted, 

And horror hath taketh hold on my 
flesh. 

7Wherefore do the wicked live, 

Become old, yea, wax mighty in 
power? 

8Their seed is established in their 
sight with them, 

And their offspring before their 
eyes. 

9Their houses are safe, without fear, 

Neither is the rod of God upon 
them. 

10Their bull gendereth, and faileth 
not; 

Their cow calveth, and casteth not 
her calf. 

11They send forth their little ones 
like a flock, 

And their children dance. 

12They sing to the timbrel and harp, 

And rejoice at the sound of the pipe. 

13They spend their days in 
prosperity, 

And peacefully they go down to the 
grave. 

14Yet they said unto God: ‘Depart 
from us; 21 




For we desire not the knowledge of 
Thy ways. 

15What is the Almighty, that we 
should serve Him? 

And what profit should we have, if 
we pray unto Him?’— 

16Lo, their prosperity is not in their 
hand; 

The counsel of the wicked is far 
from me. 

 

17How oft is it that the lamp of the 
wicked is put out? 

That their calamity cometh upon 
them? 

That He distributeth pains in His 
anger? 

18That they are as stubble before the 
wind, 

And as chaff that the storm stealeth 
away? 

19’God layeth up his iniquity for his 
children! ’— 

Let Him recompense it unto himself, 
that he may know it. 

20Let his own eyes see his 
destruction, 

And let him drink of the wrath of 
the Almighty. 

21For what pleasure hath he in his 
house after him? 

Seeing the number of his months is 
determined. 

 

22Shall any teach God knowledge? 

Seeing it is He that judgeth those 
that are high. 

23One dieth in his full strength, 

Being wholly at ease and quiet; 

24His pails are full of milk, 

And the marrow of his bones is 
moistened. 

25And another dieth in bitterness of 
soul, 

And hath never tasted of good. 

26They lie down alike in the dust, 

And the worm covereth them. 

 

27Behold, I know your thoughts, 

And the devices which ye 
wrongfully imagine against me. 

28For ye say: ‘Where is the house of 
the prince? 

And where is the tent wherein the 
wicked dwelt?’ 

29Have ye not asked them that go by 
the way; 

And will ye misdeem their tokens, 

30That the evil man is reserved to the 
day of calamity, 

That they are led forth to the day of 
wrath? 

31But who shall declare his way to 
his face? 

And who shall repay him what he 
hath done? 

32For he is borne to the grave, 

And watch is kept over his tomb. 

33The clods of the valley are sweet 
unto him, 

And all men draw after him, 

As there were innumerable before 
him. 

34How then comfort ye me in vain? 

And as for your answers, there 
remaineth only faithlessness? 

 


Then answered Eliphaz the 
Temanite, and said: 

2Can a man be profitable unto God? 

Or can he that is wise be profitable 
unto Him? 

3Is it any advantage to the Almighty, 
that thou art righteous? 

Or is it gain to Him, that thou 
makest thy ways blameless? 

4Is it for thy fear of Him that He 
reproveth thee, 

That He entereth with thee into 
judgment? 

5Is not thy wickedness great? 

And are not thine iniquities without 
end? 

6For thou hast taken pledges of thy 
brother for nought, 

And stripped the naked of their 
clothing. 

7Thou hast not given water to the 
weary to drink, 

And thou hast withholden bread 
from the hungry. 

8And as a mighty man, who hath the 
earth, 

And as a man of rank, who dwelleth 
in it, 

9Thou hast sent widows away 
empty, 

And the arms of the fatherless have 
been broken. 

10Therefore snares are round about 
thee, 

And sudden dread affrighted thee, 

11Or darkness, that thou canst not 
see, 

And abundance of waters cover 
thee. 

12Is not God in the height of heaven? 

And behold the topmost of the stars, 
how high they are! 

13And thou sayest: ‘What doth God 
know? 

Can He judge through the dark 
cloud? 

14Thick clouds are a covering to 
Him, that He seeth not; 

And He walketh in the circuit of 
heaven.’ 

15Wilt thou keep the old way 

Which wicked men have trodden? 

16Who were snatched away before 
their time, 

Whose foundation was poured out 
as a stream; 

17Who said unto God: ‘Depart from 
us’; 

And what could the Almighty do 
unto them? 

18Yet He filled their houses with 
good things— 

But the counsel of the wicked is far 
from me. 

19The righteous saw it, and were 
glad, 

And the innocent laugh them to 
scorn: 

20’Surely their substance is cut off, 

And their abundance the fire hath 
consumed.’ 

 

21Acquaint now thyself with Him, 
and be at peace; 

Thereby shall thine increase be 
good. 

22Receive, I pray thee, instruction 
from His mouth, 
22 




And lay up His words in thy heart. 

23If thou return to the Almighty, 
thou shalt be built up— 

If thou put away unrighteousness far 
from thy tents, 

24And lay thy treasure in the dust, 

And the gold of Ophir among the 
stones of the brooks; 

25And the Almighty be thy treasure, 

And precious silver unto thee; 

26Then surely shalt thou have thy 
delight in the Almighty, 

And shalt lift up thy face unto God. 

27Thou shalt make thy prayer unto 
Him, and He will hear thee, 

And thou shalt pay thy vows; 

28Thou shalt also decree a thing, and 
it shall be established unto thee, 

And light shall shine upon thy ways. 

 

29When they cast thee down, thou 
shalt say: ‘There is lifting up’; 

For the humble person He saveth. 

30He delivereth him that is innocent, 

Yea, thou shalt be delivered through 
the cleanness of thy hands. 

 

Then Job answered and said: 

2Even to-day is my complaint 
bitter; 

My hand is become heavy because 
of my groaning. 

3Oh that I knew where I might find 
Him, 

That I might come even to His seat! 

4I would order my cause before 
Him, 

And fill my mouth with arguments. 

5I would know the words which He 
would answer me, 

And understand what He would say 
unto me. 

6Would He contend with me in His 
great power? 

Nay; but He would give heed unto 
me. 

7There the upright might reason 
with Him; 

So should I be delivered for ever 
from my Judge. 

 

8Behold, I go forward, but He is not 
there, 

And backward, but I cannot 
perceive Him; 

9On the left hand, when He doth 
work, but I cannot behold Him, 

He turneth Himself to the right 
hand, but I cannot see Him. 

 

10For He knoweth the way that I 
take; 

When He hath tried me, I shall come 
forth as gold. 

11My foot hath held fast to His steps, 

His way have I kept, and turned not 
aside. 

12I have not gone back from the 
commandment of His lips; 

I have treasured up the words of His 
mouth more than my necessary 
food. 

 

13But He is at one with Himself, and 
who can turn Him? 

And what His soul desireth, even 
that He doeth. 
23 




14For He will perform that which is 
appointed for me; 

And many such things are with 
Him. 

15Therefore am I affrighted at His 
presence; 

When I consider, I am afraid of 
Him. 

16Yea, God hath made my heart 
faint, 

And the Almighty hath affrighted 
me; 

17Because I was not cut off before 
the darkness, 

Neither did He cover the thick 
darkness from my face. 

 

Why are times not laid up by 
the Almighty? 

And why do not they that know Him 
see His days? 

2There are that remove the 
landmarks; 

They violently take away flocks, 
and feed them. 

3They drive away the ass of the 
fatherless, 

They take the widow’s ox for a 
pledge. 

4They turn the needy out of the way; 

The poor of the earth hide 
themselves together. 

5Behold, as wild asses in the 
wilderness 

They go forth to their work, seeking 
diligently for food; 

The desert yieldeth them bread for 
their children. 

6They cut his provender in the field; 

And they despoil the vineyard of the 
wicked. 

7They lie all night naked without 
clothing, 

And have no covering in the cold. 

8They are wet with the showers of 
the mountains, 

And embrace the rock for want of a 
shelter. 

9There are that pluck the fatherless 
from the breast, 

And take a pledge of the poor; 

10So that they go about naked 
without clothing, 

And being hungry they carry the 
sheaves; 

11They make oil within the rows of 
these men; 

They tread their winepresses, and 
suffer thirst. 

12From out of the populous city men 
groan, 

And the soul of the wounded crieth 
out; 

Yet God imputeth it not for 
unseemliness. 

 

13These are of them that rebel 
against the light; 

They know not the ways thereof, 
nor abide in the paths thereof. 

14The murderer riseth with the light, 
to kill the poor and needy; 

And in the night he is as a thief. 

15The eye also of the adulterer 
waiteth for the twilight, 

Saying: ‘No eye shall see me’; 

And he putteth a covering on his 
face. 
24 




16In the dark they dig through 
houses; 

They shut themselves up in the day-
time; 

They know not the light. 

17For the shadow of death is to all of 
them as the morning; 

For they know the terrors of the 
shadow of death. 

 

18He is swift upon the face of the 
waters; 

Their portion is cursed in the earth; 

He turneth not by the way of the 
vineyards. 

19Drought and heat consume the 
snow waters; 

So doth the nether-world those that 
have sinned. 

20The womb forgetteth him; the 
worm feedeth sweetly on him; 

He shall be no more remembered; 

And unrighteousness is broken as a 
tree. 

21He devoureth the barren that 
beareth not; 

And doeth not good to the widow. 

22He draweth away the mighty also 
by his power; 

He riseth up, and he trusteth not his 
own life. 

23Though it be given him to be in 
safety, whereon he resteth, 

Yet His eyes are upon their ways. 

24They are exalted for a little while, 
and they are gone; 

Yea, they are brought low, they are 
gathered in as all others, 

And wither as the tops of the ears of 
corn. 

25And if it be not so now, who will 
prove me a liar, 

And make my speech nothing 
worth? 

 

Then answered Bildad the 
Shuhite, and said: 

2Dominion and fear are with Him; 

He maketh peace in His high places. 

3Is there any number of His armies? 

And upon whom doth not His light 
arise? 

4How then can man be just with 
God? 

Or how can he be clean that is born 
of a woman? 

5Behold, even the moon hath no 
brightness, 

And the stars are not pure in His 
sight; 

6How much less man, that is a 
worm! 

And the son of man, that is a 
maggot! 

 

Then Job answered and said: 

2How hast thou helped him 
that is without power! 

How hast thou saved the arm that 
hath no strength! 

3How hast thou counselled him that 
hath no wisdom, 

And plentifully declared sound 
knowledge! 

4With whose help hast thou uttered 
words? 
25 

26 




And whose spirit came forth from 
thee? 

 

5The shades tremble 

Beneath the waters and the 
inhabitants thereof. 

6The nether-world is naked before 
Him, 

And Destruction hath no covering. 

7He stretcheth out the north over the 
empty space, 

And hangeth the earth over nothing. 

8He bindeth up the waters in His 
thick clouds; 

And the cloud is not rent under 
them. 

9He closeth in the face of His 
throne, 

And spreadeth His cloud upon it. 

10He hath described a boundary 
upon the face of the waters, 

Unto the confines of light and 
darkness. 

11The pillars of heaven tremble 

And are astonished at His rebuke. 

12He stirreth up the sea with His 
power, 

And by His understanding He 
smiteth through Rahab. 

13By His breath the heavens are 
serene; 

His hand hath pierced the slant 
serpent. 

14Lo, these are but the outskirts of 
His ways; 

And how small a whisper is heard of 
Him! 

But the thunder of His mighty deeds 
who can understand? 

 

And Job again took up his 
parable, and said: 

2As God liveth, who hath taken 
away my right; 

And the Almighty, who hath dealt 
bitterly with me; 

3All the while my breath is in me 

And the spirit of God is in my 
nostrils, 

4Surely my lips shall not speak 
unrighteousness, 

Neither shall my tongue utter deceit; 

5Far be it from me that I should 
justify you; 

Till I die I will not put away mine 
integrity from me. 

6My righteousness I hold fast, and 
will not let it go; 

My heart shall not reproach me so 
long as I live. 

 

7Let mine enemy be as the wicked, 

And let him that riseth up against 
me be as the unrighteous. 

8For what is the hope of the godless, 
though he get him gain, 

When God taketh away his soul? 

9Will God hear his cry, 

When trouble cometh upon him? 

10Will he have his delight in the 
Almighty, 

And call upon God at all times? 

11I will teach you concerning the 
hand of God; 

That which is with the Almighty 
will I not conceal. 

12Behold, all ye yourselves have 
seen it; 
27 




Why then are ye become altogether 
vain? 

13This is the portion of a wicked 
man with God, 

And the heritage of oppressors, 
which they receive from the 
Almighty. 

14If his children be multiplied, it is 
for the sword; 

And his offspring shall not have 
bread enough. 

15Those that remain of him shall be 
buried by pestilence, 

And his widows shall make no 
lamentation. 

16Though he heap up silver as the 
dust, 

And prepare raiment as the clay; 

17He may prepare it, but the just 
shall put it on, 

And the innocent shall divide the 
silver. 

18He buildeth his house as a moth, 

And as a booth which the keeper 
maketh. 

19He lieth down rich, but there shall 
be nought to gather; 

He openeth his eyes, and his wealth 
is not. 

20Terrors overtake him like waters; 

A tempest stealeth him away in the 
night. 

21The east wind carrieth him away, 
and he departeth; 

And it sweepeth him out of his 
place. 

22Yea, it hurleth at him, and spareth 
not; 

He would fain flee from its power. 

23Men shall clap their hands at him, 

And shall hiss him out of his place. 

 

For there is a mine for silver, 
And a place for gold which 
they refine. 

2Iron is taken out of the dust, 

And brass is molten out of the stone. 

3Man setteth an end to darkness, 

And searcheth out to the furthest 
bound 

The stones of thick darkness and of 
the shadow of death. 

4He breaketh open a shaft away 
from where men sojourn; 

They are forgotten of the foot that 
passeth by; 

They hang afar from men, they 
swing to and fro. 

5As for the earth, out of it cometh 
bread, 

And underneath it is turned up as it 
were by fire. 

6The stones thereof are the place of 
sapphires, 

And it hath dust of gold. 

7That path no bird of prey knoweth, 

Neither hath the falcon’s eye seen it; 

8The proud beasts have not trodden 
it, 

Nor hath the lion passed thereby. 

9He putteth forth his hand upon the 
flinty rock; 

He overturneth the mountains by the 
roots. 

10He cutteth out channels among the 
rocks; 

And his eye seeth every precious 
thing. 
28 




11He bindeth the streams that they 
trickle not; 

And the thing that is hid bringeth he 
forth to light. 

 

12But wisdom, where shall it be 
found? 

And where is the place of 
understanding? 

13Man knoweth not the price 
thereof; 

Neither is it found in the land of the 
living. 

14The deep saith: ‘It is not in me’; 

And the sea saith: ‘It is not with 
me.’ 

15It cannot be gotten for gold, 

Neither shall silver be weighed for 
the price thereof. 

16It cannot be valued with the gold 
of Ophir, 

With the precious onyx, or the 
sapphire. 

17Gold and glass cannot equal it; 

Neither shall the exchange thereof 
be vessels of fine gold. 

18No mention shall be made of coral 
or of crystal; 

Yea, the price of wisdom is above 
rubies. 

19The topaz of Ethiopia shall not 
equal it, 

Neither shall it be valued with pure 
gold. 

 

20Whence then cometh wisdom? 

And where is the place of 
understanding? 

21Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all 
living, 

And kept close from the fowls of the 
air. 

22Destruction and Death say: 

‘We have heard a rumor thereof 
with our ears.’ 

23God understandeth the way 
thereof, 

And He knoweth the place thereof. 

24For He looketh to the ends of the 
earth, 

And seeth under the whole heaven; 

25When He maketh a weight for the 
wind, 

And meteth out the waters by 
measure. 

26When He made a decree for the 
rain, 

And a way for the storm of 
thunders; 

27Then did He see it, and declare it; 

He established it, yea, and searched 
it out. 

 

28And unto man He said: 

‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is 
wisdom; 

And to depart from evil is 
understanding.’ 

 

And Job again took up his 
parable, and said: 

2Oh that I were as in the months of 
old, 

As in the days when God watched 
over me; 

3When His lamp shined above my 
head, 
29 




And by His light I walked through 
darkness; 

4As I was in the days of my youth, 

When the converse of God was 
upon my tent; 

5When the Almighty was yet with 
me, 

And my children were about me; 

6When my steps were washed with 
butter, 

And the rock poured me out rivers 
of oil! 

7When I went forth to the gate unto 
the city, 

When I prepared my seat in the 
broad place, 

8The young men saw me and hid 
themselves, 

And the aged rose up and stood; 

9The princes refrained talking, 

And laid their hand on their mouth; 

10The voice of the nobles was 
hushed, 

And their tongue cleaved to the roof 
of their mouth. 

11For when the ear heard me, then it 
blessed me, 

And when the eye saw me, it gave 
witness unto me; 

12Because I delivered the poor that 
cried, 

The fatherless also, that had none to 
help him. 

13The blessing of him that was ready 
to perish came upon me; and I 
caused the widow’s heart to sing 
for joy. 

14I put on righteousness, and it 
clothed itself with me; 

My justice was as a robe and a 
diadem. 

15I was eyes to the blind, 

And feet was I to the lame. 

16I was a father to the needy; 

And the cause of him that I knew 
not I searched out. 

17And I broke the jaws of the 
unrighteous, 

And plucked the prey out of his 
teeth. 

18Then I said: ‘I shall die with my 
nest, 

And I shall multiply my days as the 
phoenix; 

19My root shall be spread out to the 
waters, 

And the dew shall lie all night upon 
my branch; 

20My glory shall be fresh in me, 

And my bow shall be renewed in 
my hand.’ 

 

21Unto me men gave ear, and 
waited, 

And kept silence for my counsel. 

22After my words they spoke not 
again; 

And my speech dropped upon them. 

23And they waited for me as for the 
rain; 

And they opened their mouth wide 
as for the latter rain. 

24If I laughed on them, they believed 
it not; 

And the light of my countenance 
they cast not down. 

25I chose out their way, and sat as 
chief, 


And dwelt as a king in the army, 

As one that comforteth the 
mourners. 

 

But now they that are younger 
than I have me in derision, 

Whose fathers I disdained to set 
with the dogs of my flock. 

2Yea, the strength of their hands, 
whereto should it profit me? 

Men in whom ripe age is perished. 

3They are gaunt with want and 
famine; 

They gnaw the dry ground, in the 
gloom of wasteness and 
desolation. 

4They pluck salt-wort with 
wormwood; 

And the roots of the broom are their 
food. 

5They are driven forth from the 
midst of men; 

They cry after them as after a thief. 

6In the clefts of the valleys must 
they dwell, 

In holes of the earth and of the 
rocks. 

7Among the bushes they bray; 

Under the nettles they are gathered 
together. 

8They are children of churls, yea, 
children of ignoble men; 

They were scourged out of the land. 

 

9And now I am become their song, 

Yea, I am a byword unto them. 

10They abhor me, they flee far from 
me, 

And spare not to spit in my face. 

11For He hath loosed my cord, and 
afflicted me, 

And they have cast off the bridle 
before me. 

12Upon my right hand rise the 
brood; 

They entangle my feet, 

And they cast up against me their 
ways of destruction. 

13They break up my path, 

They further my calamity, 

Even men that have no helper. 

14As through a wide breach they 
come; 

In the midst of the ruin they roll 
themselves upon me. 

15Terrors are turned upon me, 

They chase mine honour as the 
wind; 

And my welfare is passed away as a 
cloud. 

 

16And now my soul is poured out 
within me; 

Days of affliction have taken hold 
upon me. 

17In the night my bones are pierced, 
and fall from me, 

And my sinews take no rest. 

18By the great force [of my disease] 
is my garment disfigured; 

It bindeth me about as the collar of 
my coat. 

19He hath cast me into the mire, 

And I am become like dust and 
ashes. 

20I cry unto Thee, and Thou dost not 
answer me; 

I stand up, and Thou lookest at me. 
30 




21Thou art turned to be cruel to me; 

With the might of Thy hand Thou 
hatest me. 

22Thou liftest me up to the wind, 
Thou causest me to ride upon it; 

And Thou dissolvest my substance. 

23For I know that Thou wilt bring 
me to death, 

And to the house appointed for all 
living. 

 

24Surely none shall put forth his 
hand to a ruinous heap, 

Neither because of these things shall 
help come in one’s calamity, 

25If I have not wept for him that was 
in trouble, 

And if my soul grieved not for the 
needy. 

26Yet, when I looked for good, there 
came evil; 

And when I waited for light, there 
came darkness. 

27Mine inwards boil, and rest not; 

Days of affliction are come upon 
me. 

28I go mourning without the sun; 

I stand up in the assembly, and cry 
for help. 

29I am become a brother to jackals, 

And a companion to ostriches. 

30My skin is black, and falleth from 
me, 

And my bones are burned with heat. 

31Therefore is my harp turned to 
mourning, 

And my pipe into the voice of them 
that weep. 

 

I made a covenant with mine 
eyes; 

How then should I look upon a 
maid? 

2For what would be the portion of 
God from above, 

And the heritage of the Almighty 
from on high? 

3Is it not calamity to the 
unrighteous, 

And disaster to the workers of 
iniquity? 

4Doth not He see my ways, 

And count all my steps? 

 

5If I have walked with vanity, 

And my foot hath hasted to deceit— 

6Let me be weighed in a just 
balance, 

That God may know mine 
integrity— 

7If my step hath turned out of the 
way, 

And my heart walked after mine 
eyes, 

And if any spot hath cleaved to my 
hands; 

8Then let me sow, and let another 
eat; 

Yea, let the produce of my field be 
rooted out. 

 

9If my heart have been enticed unto 
a woman, 

And I have lain in wait at my 
neighbour’s door; 

10Then let my wife grind unto 
another, 

And let others bow down upon her. 
31 




11For that were a heinous crime; 

Yea, it were an iniquity to be 
punished by the judges. 

12For it is a fire that consumeth unto 
destruction, 

And would root out all mine 
increase. 

 

13If I did despise the cause of my 
man-servant, 

Or of my maid-servant, when they 
contended with me— 

14What then shall I do when God 
riseth up? 

And when He remembereth, what 
shall I answer Him? 

15Did not He that made me in the 
womb make him? 

And did not One fashion us in the 
womb? 

 

16If I have withheld aught that the 
poor desired, 

Or have caused the eyes of the 
widow to fail; 

17Or have eaten my morsel myself 
alone, 

And the fatherless hath not eaten 
thereof— 

18Nay, from my youth he grew up 
with me as with a father, 

And I have been her guide from my 
mother’s womb. 

19If I have seen any wanderer in 
want of clothing, 

Or that the needy had no covering; 

20If his loins have not blessed me, 

And if he were not warmed with the 
fleece of my sheep; 

21If I have lifted up my hand against 
the fatherless, 

Because I saw my help in the gate; 

22Then let my shoulder fall from the 
shoulder-blade, 

And mine arm be broken from the 
bone. 

23For calamity from God was a 
terror to me, 

And by reason of His majesty I 
could do nothing. 

24If I have made gold my hope, 

And have said to the fine gold: 
‘Thou art my confidence’; 

25If I rejoiced because my wealth 
was great, 

And because my hand had gotten 
much; 

26If I beheld the sun when it shined, 

Or the moon walking in brightness; 

27And my heart hath been secretly 
enticed, 

And my mouth hath kissed my 
hand; 

28This also were an iniquity to be 
punished by the judges; 

For I should have lied to God that is 
above. 

 

29If I rejoiced at the destruction of 
him that hated me, 

Or exulted when evil found him— 

30Yea, I suffered not my mouth to 
sin 

By asking his life with a curse. 

31If the men of my tent said not: 

‘Who can find one that hath not 
been satisfied with his meat?’ 


32The stranger did not lodge in the 
street; 

My doors I opened to the roadside. 

 

33If after the manner of men I 
covered my transgressions, 

By hiding mine iniquity in my 
bosom— 

34Because I feared the great 
multitude, 

And the most contemptible among 
families terrified me, 

So that I kept silence, and went not 
out of the door. 

 

35Oh that I had one to hear me!— 

Lo, here is my signature, let the 
Almighty answer me— 

And that I had the indictment which 
mine adversary hath written! 

36Surely I would carry it upon my 
shoulder; 

I would bind it unto me as a crown. 

37I would declare unto him the 
number of my steps; 

As a prince would I go near unto 
him. 

 

38If my land cry out against me, 

And the furrows thereof weep 
together; 

39If I have eaten the fruits thereof 
without money, 

Or have caused the tillers thereof to 
be disappointed— 

40Let thistles grow instead of wheat, 

And noisome weeds instead of 
barley. 

 

The words of Job are ended. 

 

So these three men ceased to 
answer Job, because he was 
righteous in his own eyes. 2Then was 
kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of 
Barachel the Buzite, of the family of 
Ram; against Job was his wrath 
kindled, because he justified himself 
rather than God. 3Also against his 
three friends was his wrath kindled, 
because they had found no answer, and 
yet had condemned Job. 4Now Elihu 
had waited to speak unto Job, because 
they were older than he. 5And when 
Elihu saw that there was no answer in 
the mouth of these three men, his 
wrath was kindled. 

6And Elihu the son of Barachel the 
Buzite answered and said: 

I am young, and ye are very old; 

Wherefore I held back, and durst not 
declare you mine opinion. 

7I said: ‘Days should speak, 

And multitude of years should teach 
wisdom.’ 

8But it is a spirit in man, 

And the breath of the Almighty, that 
giveth them understanding. 

9It is not the great that are wise, 

Nor the aged that discern judgment. 

10Therefore I say: ‘Hearken to me; 

I also will declare mine opinion.’ 

 

11Behold, I waited for your words, 

I listened for your reasons, 

Whilst ye searched out what to say. 

12Yea, I attended unto you, 
32 




And, behold, there was none that 
convinced Job, 

Or that answered his words, among 
you. 

13Beware lest ye say: ‘We have 
found wisdom; 

God may vanquish him, not man! ’ 

14For he hath not directed his words 
against me; 

Neither will I answer him with your 
speeches. 

 

15They are amazed, they answer no 
more; 

Words are departed from them. 

16And shall I wait, because they 
speak not, 

Because they stand still, and answer 
no more? 

17I also will answer my part, 

I also will declare mine opinion. 

18For I am full of words; 

The spirit within me constraineth 
me. 

19Behold, mine inwards are as wine 
which hath no vent; 

Like new wine-skins which are 
ready to burst. 

20I will speak, that I may find relief; 

I will open my lips and answer. 

21Let me not, I pray you, respect any 
man’s person; 

Neither will I give flattering titles 
unto any man. 

22For I know not to give flattering 
titles; 

Else would my Maker soon take me 
away 

 

Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear 
my speech, 

And hearken to all my words. 

2Behold now, I have opened my 
mouth, 

My tongue hath spoken in my 
mouth. 

3My words shall utter the 
uprightness of my heart; 

And that which my lips know they 
shall speak sincerely. 

4The spirit of God hath made me, 

And the breath of the Almighty 
given me life. 

5If thou canst, answer thou me, 

Set thy words in order before me, 
stand forth. 

6Behold, I am toward God even as 
thou art; 

I also am formed out of the clay. 

7Behold, my terror shall not make 
thee afraid, 

Neither shall my pressure be heavy 
upon thee. 

 

8Surely thou hast spoken in my 
hearing, 

And I have heard the voice of thy 
words; 

9’I am clean, without transgression, 

I am innocent, neither is there 
iniquity in me; 

10Behold, He findeth occasions 
against me, 

He counteth me for His enemy; 

11He putteth my feet in the stocks, 

He marketh all my paths.’ 

 
33 




12Behold, I answer thee: In this thou 
art not right, 

That God is too great for man; 

13Why hast thou striven against 
Him? 

Seeing that He will not answer any 
of his words. 

14For God speaketh in one way, 

Yea in two, though man perceiveth 
it not. 

15In a dream, in a vision of the night, 

When deep sleep falleth upon men, 

In slumberings upon the bed; 

16Then He openeth the ears of men, 

And by their chastisement sealeth 
the decree, 

17That men may put away their 
purpose, 

And that He may hide pride from 
man; 

18That He may keep back his soul 
from the pit, 

And his life from perishing by the 
sword. 

19He is chastened also with pain 
upon his bed, 

And all his bones grow stiff; 

20So that his life maketh him to 
abhor bread, 

And his soul dainty food. 

21His flesh is consumed away, that it 
cannot be seen; 

And his bones corrode to 
unsightliness. 

22Yea, his soul draweth near unto 
the pit, 

And his life to the destroyers. 

23If there be for him an angel, 

An intercessor, one among a 
thousand, 

To vouch for a man’s uprightness; 

24Then He is gracious unto him, and 
saith: 

‘Deliver him from going down to 
the pit, 

I have found a ransom.’ 

25His flesh is tenderer than a child’s; 

He returneth to the days of his 
youth; 

26He prayeth unto God, and He is 
favourable unto him; 

So that he seeth His face with joy; 

And He restoreth unto man his 
righteousness. 

27He cometh before men, and saith: 

‘I have sinned, and perverted that 
which was right, 

And it profited me not.’ 

28So He redeemeth his soul from 
going into the pit, 

And his life beholdeth the light. 

 

29Lo, all these things doth God 
work, 

Twice, yea thrice, with a man, 

30To bring back his soul from the 
pit, 

That he may be enlightened with the 
light of the living. 

 

31Mark well, O Job, hearken unto 
me; 

Hold thy peace, and I will speak. 

32If thou hast any thing to say, 
answer me; 

Speak, for I desire to justify thee. 

33If not, hearken thou unto me; 


Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee 
wisdom. 

 

Moreover Elihu answered and 
said: 

2Hear my words, ye wise men; 

And give ear unto me, ye that have 
knowledge. 

3For the ear trieth words, 

As the palate tasteth food. 

4Let us choose for us that which is 
right; 

Let us know among ourselves what 
is good. 

5For Job hath said: ‘I am righteous, 

And God hath taken away my right; 

6Notwithstanding my right I am 
accounted a liar; 

My wound is incurable, though I am 
without transgression.’ 

7What man is like Job, 

Who drinketh up scorning like 
water? 

8Who goeth in company with the 
workers of iniquity, 

And walketh with wicked men. 

9For he hath said: ‘It profiteth a man 
nothing 

That he should be in accord with 
God.’ 

 

10Therefore hearken unto me, ye 
men of understanding: 

Far be it from God, that He should 
do wickedness; 

And from the Almighty, that He 
should commit iniquity. 

11For the work of a man will He 
requite unto him, 

And cause every man to find 
according to his ways. 

12Yea, of a surety, God will not do 
wickedly, 

Neither will the Almighty pervert 
justice. 

13Who gave Him a charge over the 
earth? 

Or who hath disposed the whole 
world? 

14If He set His heart upon man, 

If He gather unto Himself his spirit 
and his breath; 

15All flesh shall perish together, 

And man shall return unto dust. 

 

16If now thou hast understanding, 
hear this; 

Hearken to the voice of my words. 

17Shall even one that hateth right 
govern? 

And wilt thou condemn Him that is 
just and mighty— 

18Is it fit to say to a king: ‘Thou art 
base’? 

Or to nobles: ‘Ye are wicked’?— 

19That respecteth not the persons of 
princes, 

Nor regardeth the rich more than the 
poor? 

For they all are the work of His 
hands. 

20In a moment they die, even at 
midnight; 

The people are shaken and pass 
away, 

And the mighty are taken away 
without hand. 

 
34 




21For His eyes are upon the ways of 
a man, 

And He seeth all his goings. 

22There is no darkness, nor shadow 
of death, 

Where the workers of iniquity may 
hide themselves. 

23For He doth not appoint a time 
unto any man, 

When he should go before God in 
judgment. 

24He breaketh in pieces mighty men 
without inquisition, 

And setteth others in their stead. 

25Therefore He taketh knowledge of 
their works; 

And He overturneth them in the 
night, so that they are crushed. 

26He striketh them as wicked men 

In the open sight of others; 

27Because they turned aside from 
following Him, 

And would not have regard to any 
of His ways; 

28So that they cause the cry of the 
poor to come unto Him, 

And He heareth the cry of the 
afflicted. 

29When He giveth quietness, who 
then can condemn? 

And when He hideth His face, who 
then can behold Him? 

Whether it be done unto a nation, or 
unto a man, alike; 

30That the godless man reign not, 

That there be none to ensnare the 
people. 

 

31For hath any said unto God: 

‘I have borne chastisement, though I 
offend not; 

32That which I see not teach Thou 
me; 

If I have done iniquity, I will do it 
no more’? 

33Shall His recompense be as thou 
wilt? For thou loathest it, 

So that thou must choose, and not I; 

Therefore speak what thou knowest. 

34Men of understanding will say 
unto me, 

Yea, every wise man that heareth 
me: 

35’Job speaketh without knowledge, 

And his words are without 
discernment.’ 

36Would that Job were tried unto the 
end, 

Because of his answering like 
wicked men. 

37For he addeth rebellion unto his 
sin, 

He clappeth his hands among us, 

And multiplieth his words against 
God. 

 

Moreover Elihu answered and 
said: 

2Thinkest thou this to be thy right, 

Or sayest thou: ‘I am righteousness 
before God’, 

3That thou inquirest: ‘What 
advantage will it be unto Thee?’ 

And: ‘What profit shall I have, more 
than if I had sinned?’ 

4I will give thee answer, 

And thy companions with thee. 

5Look unto the heavens, and see; 
35 




And behold the skies, which are 
higher than thou. 

6If thou hast sinned, what doest thou 
against Him? 

And if thy transgressions be 
multiplied, what doest thou unto 
Him? 

7If thou be righteous, what givest 
thou Him? 

Or what receiveth He of thy hand? 

8Thy wickedness concerneth a man 
as thou art; 

And thy righteousness a son of man. 

 

9By reason of the multitude of 
oppressions they cry out; 

They cry for help by reason of the 
arm of the mighty. 

10But none saith: ‘Where is God my 
Maker, 

Who giveth songs in the night; 

11Who teacheth us more than the 
beasts of the earth, 

And maketh us wiser than the fowls 
of heaven?’ 

12There they cry, but none giveth 
answer, 

Because of the pride of evil men. 

13Surely God will not hear vanity, 

Neither will the Almighty regard it. 

14Yea, when thou sayest thou canst 
not see Him— 

The cause is before Him; therefore 
wait thou for Him. 

15And now, is it for nought that He 
punished in His anger? 

And hath He not full knowledge of 
arrogance? 

16But Job doth open his mouth in 
vanity; 

He multiplieth words without 
knowledge. 

 

Elihu also proceeded, and 
said: 

2Suffer me a little, and I will tell 
thee; 

For there are yet words on God’s 
behalf. 

3I will fetch my knowledge from 
afar, 

And will ascribe righteousness to 
my Maker. 

4For truly my words are not false; 

One that is upright in mind is with 
thee. 

5Behold, God is mighty, yet He 
despiseth not any; 

He is mighty in strength of 
understanding. 

6He preserveth not the life of the 
wicked; 

But giveth to the poor their right. 

7He withdraweth not His eyes from 
the righteous; 

But with kings upon the throne 

He setteth them for ever, and they 
are exalted. 

8And if they be bound in fetters, 

And be holden in cords of affliction; 

9Then He declareth unto them their 
work, 

And their transgressions, that they 
have behaved themselves 
proudly. 

10He openeth also their ear to 
discipline, 
36 




And commandeth that they return 
from iniquity. 

11If they hearken and serve Him, 

They shall spend their days in 
prosperity, 

And their years in pleasures. 

12But if they hearken not, they shall 
perish by the sword, 

And they shall die without 
knowledge. 

13But they that are godless in heart 
lay up anger; 

They cry not for help when He 
bindeth them. 

14Their soul perisheth in youth, 

And their life as that of the 
depraved. 

15He delivereth the afflicted by His 
affliction, 

And openeth their ear by tribulation. 

16Yea, He hath allured thee out of 
distress 

Into a broad place, where there is no 
straitness; 

And that which is set on thy table is 
full of fatness; 

17And thou art full of the judgment 
of the wicked; 

Judgment and justice take hold on 
them. 

18For beware of wrath, lest thou be 
led away by thy sufficiency; 

Neither let the greatness of the 
ransom turn thee aside. 

19Will thy riches avail, that are 
without stint, 

Or all the forces of thy strength? 

20Desire not the night, 

When peoples are cut off in their 
place. 

21Take heed, regard not iniquity; 

For this hast thou chosen rather than 
affliction. 

 

22Behold, God doeth loftily in His 
power; 

Who is a teacher like Him? 

23Who hath enjoined Him His way? 

Or who hath said: ‘Thou hast 
wrought unrighteousness’? 

24Remember that thou magnify His 
work, 

Whereof men have sung. 

25All men have looked thereon; 

Man beholdeth it afar off. 

26Behold, God is great, beyond our 
knowledge; 

The number of His years is 
unsearchable. 

27For He draweth away the drops of 
water, 

Which distil rain from His vapour; 

28Which the skies pour down 

And drop upon the multitudes of 
men. 

29Yea, can any understand the 
spreadings of the clouds, 

The crashings of His pavilion? 

30Behold, He spreadeth His light 
upon it; 

And He covereth the depths of the 
sea. 

31For by these He judgeth the 
peoples; 

He giveth food in abundance. 

32He covereth His hands with the 
lightning, 


And giveth it a charge that it strike 
the mark. 

33The noise thereof telleth 
concerning it, 

The cattle also concerning the storm 
that cometh up. 

 

At this also my heart 
trembleth, 

And is moved out of its place. 

2Hear attentively the noise of His 
voice, 

And the sound that goeth out of His 
mouth. 

3He sendeth it forth under the whole 
heaven, 

And His lightning unto the ends of 
the earth. 

4After it a voice roareth; 

He thundereth with the voice of His 
majesty; 

And He stayeth them not when His 
voice is heard. 

5God thundereth marvellously with 
His voice; 

Great things doeth He, which we 
cannot comprehend. 

6For He saith to the snow: ‘Fall thou 
on the earth’; 

Likewise to the shower of rain, and 
to the showers of His mighty rain. 

7He sealeth up the hand of every 
man, 

That all men whom He hath made 
may know it. 

8Then the beasts go into coverts, 

And remain in their dens. 

9Out of the Chamber cometh the 
storm; 

And cold out of the north. 

10By the breath of God ice is given, 

And the breadth of the waters is 
straitened. 

11Yea, He ladeth the thick cloud 
with moister, 

He spreadeth abroad the cloud of 
His lightning; 

12And they are turned round about 
by His guidance, 

That they may do whatsoever He 
commandeth them 

Upon the face of the habitable 
world: 

13Whether it be for correction, or for 
His earth, 

Or for mercy, that He cause it to 
come. 

 

14Hearken unto this, O Job; 

Stand still, and consider the 
wondrous works of God. 

15Dost thou know how God 
enjoineth them, 

And causeth the lightning of His 
cloud to shine? 

16Dost thou know the balancings of 
the clouds, 

The wondrous works of Him who is 
perfect in knowledge? 

17Thou whose garments are warm, 

When the earth is still by reason of 
the south wind; 

18Canst thou with Him spread out 
the sky, 

Which is strong as a molten mirror? 

19Teach us what we shall say unto 
Him; 
37 




For we cannot order our speech by 
reason of darkness. 

20Shall it be told Him that I would 
speak? 

Or should a man wish that he were 
swallowed up? 

 

21And now men see not the light 
which is bright in the skies; 

But the wind passeth, and cleanseth 
them. 

22Out of the north cometh golden 
splendour, 

About God is terrible majesty. 

23The Almighty, whom we cannot 
find out, is excellent in power, 

Yet to judgment and plenteous 
justice He doeth no violence. 

24Men do therefore fear Him; 

He regardeth not any that are wise 
of heart. 

 

Then the LORD answered Job 
out of the whirlwind, and said: 

2Who is this that darkeneth counsel 

By words without knowledge? 

3Gird up now thy loins like a man; 

For I will demand of thee, and 
declare thou unto Me. 

 

4Where wast thou when I laid the 
foundations of the earth? 

Declare, if thou hast the 
understanding. 

5Who determined the measures 
thereof, if thou knowest? 

Or who stretched the line upon it? 

6Whereupon were the foundations 
thereof fastened? 

Or who laid the corner-stone 
thereof, 

7When the morning stars sang 
together, 

And all the sons of God shouted for 
joy? 

 

8Or who shut up the sea with doors, 

When it broke forth, and issued out 
of the womb; 

9When I made the cloud the garment 
thereof, 

And thick darkness a swaddlingband 
for it, 

10And prescribed for it My decree, 

And set bars and doors, 

11And said: ‘Thus far shalt thou 
come, but no further; 

And here shall thy proud waves be 
stayed’? 

 

12Hast thou commanded the 
morning since thy days began, 

And caused the dayspring to know 
its place; 

13That it might take hold of the ends 
of the earth, 

And the wicked be shaken out of it? 

14It is changed as clay under the 
seal; 

And they stand as a garment. 

15But from the wicked their light is 
withholden, 

And the high arm is broken. 

 

16Hast thou entered into the springs 
of the sea? 

Or hast thou walked in the recesses 
of the deep? 
38 




17Have the gates of death been 
revealed unto thee? 

Or hast thou seen the gates of the 
shadow of death? 

18Hast thou surveyed unto the 
breadths of the earth? 

Declare, if thou knowest it all. 

 

19Where is the way to the dwelling 
of light, 

And as for darkness, where is the 
place thereof; 

20That thou shouldest take it to the 
bound thereof, 

And that thou shouldest know the 
paths to the house thereof? 

21Thou knowest it, for thou wast 
then born, 

And the number of thy days is great! 

22Hast thou entered the treasuries of 
the snow, 

Or hast thou seen the treasuries of 
the hail, 

23Which I have reserved against the 
time of trouble, 

Against the day of battle and war? 

 

24By what way is the light parted, 

Or the east wind scattered upon the 
earth? 

25Who hath cleft a channel for the 
waterflood, 

Or a way for the lightning of the 
thunder; 

26To cause it to rain on a land where 
no man is, 

On the wilderness, wherein there is 
no man; 

27To satisfy the desolate and waste 
ground, 

And to cause the bud of the tender 
herb to spring forth? 

28Hath the rain a father? 

Or who hath begotten the drops of 
dew? 

29Out of whose womb came the ice? 

And the hoar-frost of heaven, who 
hath gendered it? 

30The waters are congealed like 
stone, 

And the face of the deep is frozen. 

 

31Canst thou bind the chains of the 
Pleiades, 

Or loose the bands of Orion? 

32Canst thou lead forth the 
Mazzaroth in their season? 

Or canst thou guide the Bear with 
her sons? 

33Knowest thou the ordinances of 
the heavens? 

Canst thou establish the dominion 
thereof in the earth? 

34Canst thou lift up thy voice to the 
clouds, 

That abundance of waters may 
cover thee? 

35Canst thou send forth lightnings, 
that they may go, 

And say unto thee: ‘Here we are’? 

 

36Who hath put wisdom in the 
inward parts? 

Or who hath given understanding to 
the mind? 

37Who can number the clouds by 
wisdom? 


Or who can pour out the bottles of 
heaven, 

38When the dust runneth into a mass, 

And the clods cleave fast together? 

 

39Wilt thou hunt the prey for the 
lioness? 

Or satisfy the appetite of the young 
lions, 

40When they couch in their dens, 

And abide in the covert to lie in 
wait? 

41Who provideth for the raven his 
prey, 

When his young ones cry unto God, 
and wander for lack of food? 

Knowest thou the time when 
the wild goats of the rock 
bring forth? 

Or canst thou mark when the hinds 
do calve? 

2Canst thou number the months that 
they fulfil? 

Or knowest thou the time when they 
bring forth? 

3They bow themselves, they bring 
forth their young, 

They cast out their fruit. 

4Their young ones wax strong, they 
grow up in the open field; 

They go forth, and return not again. 

 

5Who hath sent out the wild ass 
free? 

Or who hath loosed the bands of the 
wild ass? 

6Whose house I have made the 
wilderness, 

And the salt land his dwelling-place. 

7He scorneth the tumult of the city, 

Neither heareth he the shoutings of 
the driver. 

8The range of the mountains is his 
pasture, 

And he searcheth after every green 
thing. 

 

9Will the wild-ox be willing to serve 
thee? 

Or will he abide by thy crib? 

10Canst thou bind the wild-ox with 
his band in the furrow? 

Or will he harrow the valleys after 
thee? 

11Wilt thou trust him, because his 
strength is great? 

Or wilt thou leave thy labour to 
him? 

12Wilt thou rely on him, that he will 
bring home thy seed, 

And gather the corn of thy 
threshing-floor? 

 

13The wing of the ostrich beateth 
joyously; 

But are her pinions and feathers the 
kindly stork’s? 

14For she leaveth her eggs on the 
earth, 

And warmeth them in dust, 

15And forgetteth that the foot may 
crush them, 

Or that the wild beast may trample 
them. 

16She is hardened against her young 
ones, as if they were not hers; 

Though her labour be in vain, she is 
without fear; 
39 




17Because God hath deprived her of 
wisdom, 

Neither hath He imparted to her 
understanding. 

18When the time cometh, she raiseth 
her wings on high, 

And scorneth the horse and his 
rider. 

 

19Hast thou given the horse his 
strength? 

Hast thou clothed his neck with 
fierceness? 

20Hast thou made him to leap as a 
locust? 

The glory of his snorting is terrible. 

21He paweth in the valley, and 
rejoiceth in his strength; 

He goeth out to meet the clash of 
arms. 

22He mocketh at fear, and is not 
affrighted; 

Neither turneth he back from the 
sword. 

23The quiver rattleth upon him, 

The glittering spear and the javelin. 

24He swalloweth the ground with 
storm and rage; 

Neither believeth he that it is the 
voice of the horn. 

25As oft as he heareth the horn he 
saith: ‘Ha, ha! ’ 

And he smelleth the battle afar off, 

The thunder of the captains, and the 
shouting. 

 

26Doth the hawk soar by thy 
wisdom, 

And stretch her wings toward the 
south? 

27Doth the vulture mount up at thy 
command, 

And make her nest on high? 

28She dwelleth and abideth on the 
rock, 

Upon the crag of the rock, and the 
stronghold. 

29From thence she spieth out the 
prey; 

Her eyes behold it afar off. 

30Her young ones also suck up 
blood; 

And where the slain are, there is 
she. 

 

Moreover the LORD answered 
Job, and said: 

2Shall he that reproveth contend 
with the Almighty? 

He that argueth with God, let him 
answer it. 

 

3Then Job answered the LORD, and 
said: 

4Behold, I am of small account; 
what shall I answer Thee? 

I lay my hand upon my mouth. 

5Once have I spoken, but I will not 
answer again; 

Yea, twice, but I will proceed no 
further. 

 

6Then the LORD answered Job out of 
the whirlwind, and said: 

7Gird up thy loins now like a man; 

I will demand of thee, and declare 
thou unto Me. 
40 




8Wilt thou even make void My 
judgment? 

Wilt thou condemn Me, that thou 
mayest be justified? 

9Or hast thou an arm like God? 

And canst thou thunder with a voice 
like Him? 

10Deck thyself now with majesty 
and excellency, 

And array thyself with glory and 
beauty. 

11Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath; 

And look upon every one that is 
proud, and abase him. 

12Look on every one that is proud, 
and bring him low; 

And tread down the wicked in their 
place. 

13Hide them in the dust together; 

Bind their faces in the hidden place. 

14Then will I also confess unto thee 

That thine own right hand can save 
thee. 

 

15Behold now behemoth, which I 
made with thee; 

He eateth grass as an ox. 

16Lo now, his strength is in his loins, 

And his force is in the stays of his 
body. 

17He straineth his tail like a cedar; 

The sinews of his thighs are knit 
together. 

18His bones are as pipes of brass; 

His gristles are like bars of iron. 

19He is the beginning of the ways of 
God; 

He only that made him can make 
His sword to approach unto him. 

20Surely the mountains bring him 
forth food, 

And all the beasts of the field play 
there. 

21He lieth under the lotus-trees, 

In the covert of the reed, and fens. 

22The lotus-trees cover him with 
their shadow; 

The willows of the brook compass 
him about. 

23Behold, if a river overflow, he 
trembleth not; 

He is confident, though the Jordan 
rush forth to his mouth. 

24Shall any take him by his eyes, 

Or pierce through his nose with a 
snare? 

 

25Canst thou draw out leviathan with 
a fish-hook? 

Or press down his tongue with a 
cord? 

26Canst thou put a ring into his 
nose? 

Or bore his jaw through with a 
hook? 

27Will he make many supplications 
unto thee? 

Or will he speak soft words unto 
thee? 

28Will he make a covenant with 
thee, 

That thou shouldest take him for a 
servant for ever? 

29Wilt thou play with him as with a 
bird? 

Or wilt thou bind him for thy 
maidens? 


30Will the bands of fishermen make 
a banquet of him? 

Will they part him among the 
merchants? 

31Canst thou fill his skin with barbed 
irons? 

Or his head with fish-spears? 

32Lay thy hand upon him; 

Think upon the battle, thou wilt do 
so no more. 

 

Behold, the hope of him is in 
vain; 

Shall not one be cast down even at 
the sight of him? 

2None is so fierce that dare stir him 
up; 

Who then is able to stand before 
Me? 

3Who hath given Me anything 
beforehand, that I should repay 
him? 

Whatsoever is under the whole 
heaven is Mine. 

4Would I keep silence concerning 
his boastings, 

Or his proud talk, or his fair array of 
words? 

 

5Who can uncover the face of his 
garment? 

Who shall come within his double 
bridle? 

6Who can open the doors of his 
face? 

Round about his teeth is terror. 

7His scales are his pride, 

Shut up together as with a close 
seal. 

8One is so near to another, 

That no air can come between them. 

9They are joined one to another; 

They stick together, that they cannot 
be sundered. 

10His sneezings flash forth light, 

And his eyes are like the eyelids of 
the morning. 

11Out of his mouth go burning 
torches, 

And sparks of fire leap forth. 

12Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, 

As out of a seething pot and burning 
rushes. 

13His breath kindleth coals, 

And a flame goeth out of his mouth. 

14In his neck abideth strength, 

And dismay danceth before him. 

15The flakes of his flesh are joined 
together; 

They are firm upon him; they cannot 
be moved. 

16His heart is as firm as a stone; 

Yea, firm as the nether millstone. 

17When he raiseth himself up, the 
mighty are afraid; 

By reason of despair they are beside 
themselves. 

18If one lay at him with the sword, it 
will not hold; 

Nor the spear, the dart, nor the 
pointed shaft. 

19He esteemeth iron as straw, 

And brass as rotten wood. 

20The arrow cannot make him flee; 

Slingstones are turned with him into 
stubble. 

21Clubs are accounted as stubble; 
41 




He laugheth at the rattling of the 
javelin. 

22Sharpest potsherds are under him; 

He spreadeth a threshing-sledge 
upon the mire. 

23He maketh the deep to boil like a 
pot; 

He maketh the sea like a seething 
mixture. 

24He maketh a path to shine after 
him; 

One would think the deep to be 
hoary. 

25Upon earth there is not his like 

Who is made to be fearless. 

26He looketh at all high things; 

He is king over all the proud beasts. 

 

Then Job answered the LORD, 
and said: 

2I know that Thou canst do every 
thing, 

And that no purpose can be 
withholden from Thee. 

3Who is this that hideth counsel 
without knowledge? 

Therefore have I uttered that which I 
understood not, 

Things too wonderful for me, which 
I knew not. 

4Hear, I beseech Thee, and I will 
speak; 

I will demand of Thee, and declare 
Thou unto me. 

5I had heard of Thee by the hearing 
of the ear; 

But now mine eye seeth Thee; 

6Wherefore I abhor my words, and 
repent, 

Seeing I am dust and ashes. 

 

7And it was so, that after the LORD 
had spoken these words unto Job, the 
LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: 
‘My wrath is kindled against thee, and 
against thy two friends; for ye have not 
spoken of Me the thing that is right, as 
My servant Job hath. 8Now therefore, 
take unto you seven bullocks and 
seven rams, and go to My servant Job, 
and offer up for yourselves a burnt-
offering; and My servant Job shall 
pray for you; for him will I accept, that 
I do not unto you aught unseemly; for 
ye have not spoken of Me the thing 
that is right, as my servant Job hath.’ 
9So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad 
the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite 
went, and did according as the LORD 
commanded them; and the LORD 
accepted Job. 10And the LORD changed 
the fortune of Job, when he prayed for 
his friends; and the LORD gave Job 
twice as much as he had before. 11Then 
came there unto him all his brethren, 
and all his sisters, and all they that had 
been of his acquaintance before, and 
did eat bread with him in his house; 
and they bemoaned him, and 
comforted him concerning all the evil 
that the LORD had brought upon him; 
every man also gave him a piece of 
money, and every one a ring of gold. 
12So the LORD blessed the latter end of 
Job more than his beginning; and he 
had fourteen thousand sheep, and six 
thousand camels, and a thousand yoke 
of oxen, and a thousand she-asses. 
42 




13He had also seven sons and three 
daughters. 14And he called the name of 
the first, aJemimah; and the name of 
the second, bKeziah; and the name of 
the third, cKeren-happuch. 15And in all 
the land were no women found so fair 
as the daughters of Job; and their 
father gave them inheritance among 
their brethren. 16And after this Job 
lived a hundred and forty years, and 
saw his sons, and his sons’sons, even 
four generations. 17So Job died, being 
old and full of days. 

a That is, Dove. 

b That is, Cassia. 

c That is, Horn of eye-paint.
