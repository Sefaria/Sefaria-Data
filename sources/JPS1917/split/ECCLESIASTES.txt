ECCLESIASTES 

 

THE WORDs OF the Koheleth, the 
son of David, king in Jerusalem. 

 

2Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth; 

Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. 

 

3What profit hath man of all his 
labour 

Wherein he laboureth under the 
sun? 

4One generation passeth away, and 
another generation cometh; 

And the earth abideth for ever. 

5The sun also ariseth, 

And the sun goeth down, 

And hasteth to his place where he 
ariseth. 

6The wind goeth toward the south, 

And turneth about unto the north; 

It turneth about continually in its 
circuit, 

And the wind returneth again to its 
circuits. 

7All the rivers run into the sea, 

Yet the sea is not full; 

Unto the place whither the rivers go, 

Thither they go again. 

8All things toil to weariness; 

Man cannot utter it, 

The eye is not satisfied with seeing, 

Nor the ear filled with hearing. 

9That which hath been is that which 
shall be, 

And that which hath been done is 
that which shall be done; 

And there is nothing new under the 
sun. 

10Is there a thing whereof it is said: 
‘See, this is new’?—it hath been 
already, in the ages which were before 
us. 11There is no remembrance of them 
of former times; neither shall there be 
any remembrance of them of latter 
times that are to come, among those 
that shall come after. 

 

12I Koheleth have been king over 
Israel in Jerusalem. 13And I applied my 
heart to seek and to search out by 
wisdom concerning all things that are 
done under heaven; it is a sore task 
that God hath given to the sons of men 
to be exercised therewith. 14I have seen 
all the works that are done under the 
sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a 
striving after wind. 

15That which is crooked cannot be 
made straight; 

And that which is wanting cannot be 
numbered. 

16I spoke with my own heart, saying: 
‘Lo, I have gotten great wisdom, more 
also than all that were before me over 
Jerusalem’; yea, my heart hath had 
great experience of wisdom and 
knowledge. 17And I applied my heart 
to know wisdom, and to know 
1 




madness and folly—I perceived that 
this also was a striving after wind. 

18For in much wisdom is much 
vexation; 

And he that increaseth knowledge 
increaseth sorrow. 

 

I said in my heart: ‘Come now, I 
will try thee with mirth, and enjoy 
pleasure’; and, behold, this also was 
vanity. 2I said of laughter: ‘It is mad’; 
and of mirth: ‘What doth it 
accomplish?’ 3I searched in my heart 
how to pamper my flesh with wine, 
and, my heart conducting itself with 
wisdom, how yet to lay hold on folly, 
till I might see which it was best for 
the sons of men that they should do 
under the heaven the few days of their 
life. 4I made me great works; I builded 
me houses; I planted me vineyards; 5I 
made me gardens and parks, and I 
planted trees in them of all kinds of 
fruit; 6I made me pools of water, to 
water therefrom the wood springing up 
with trees; 7I acquired men-servants 
and maid-servants, and had servants 
born in my house; also I had great 
possessions of herds and flocks, above 
all that were before me in Jerusalem; 8I 
gathered me also silver and gold, and 
treasure such as kings and the 
provinces have as their own; I got me 
men-singers and women-singers, and 
the delights of the sons of men, 
women very many. 9So I was great, 
and increased more than all that were 
before me in Jerusalem; also my 
wisdom stood me in stead. 10And 
whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept 
not from them; I withheld not my heart 
from any joy, for my heart had joy of 
all my labour; and this was my portion 
from all my labour. 11Then I looked on 
all the works that my hands had 
wrought, and on the labour that I had 
laboured to do; and, behold, all was 
vanity and a striving after wind, and 
there was no profit under the sun. 

12And I turned myself to behold 
wisdom, and madness and folly; for 
what can the man do that cometh after 
the king? even that which hath been 
already done. 13Then I saw that 
wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light 
excelleth darkness. 

14The wise man, his eyes are in his 
head; 

But the fool walketh in darkness. 

And I also perceived that one event 
happeneth to them all. 15Then said I in 
my heart: ‘As it happeneth to the fool, 
so will it happen even to me; and why 
was I then more wise?’ Then I said in 
my heart, that this also is vanity. 16For 
of the wise man, even as of the fool, 
there is no remembrance for ever; 
seeing that in the days to come all will 
long ago have been forgotten. And 
how must the wise man die even as the 
fool! 17So I hated life; because the 
work that is wrought under the sun 
was grievous unto me; for all is vanity 
and a striving after wind. 

18And I hated all my labour wherein 
I laboured under the sun, seeing that I 
must leave it unto the man that shall be 
after me. 19And who knoweth whether 
2 




he will be a wise man or a fool? yet 
will he have rule over all my labour 
wherein I have laboured, and wherein I 
have shown myself wise under the sun. 
This also is vanity. 20Therefore I 
turned about to cause my heart to 
despair concerning all the labour 
wherein I had laboured under the sun. 
21For there is a man whose labour is 
with wisdom, and with knowledge, 
and with skill; yet to a man that hath 
not laboured therein shall he leave it 
for his portion. This also is vanity and 
a great evil. 22For what hath a man of 
all his labour, and of the striving of his 
heart, wherein he laboureth under the 
sun? 23For all his days are pains, and 
his occupation vexation; yea, even in 
the night his heart taketh not rest. This 
also is vanity. 

24There is nothing better for a man 
than that he should eat and drink, and 
make his soul enjoy pleasure for his 
labour. This also I saw, that it is from 
the hand of God. 25For who will eat, or 
who will enjoy, if not I? 26For to the 
man that is good in His sight He giveth 
wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but 
to the sinner He giveth the task, to 
gather and to heap up, that he may 
leave to him that is good in the sight of 
God. This also is vanity and a striving 
after wind. 

To every thing there is a season, 
and a time to every purpose under 
the heaven: 

2A time to be born, and a time to 
die; 

A time to plant, and a time to pluck 
up that which is planted; 

3A time to kill, and a time to heal; 

A time to break down, and a time to 
build up; 

4A time to weep, and a time to 
laugh; 

A time to mourn, and a time to 
dance; 

5A time to cast away stones, and a 
time to gather stones together; 

A time to embrace, and a time to 
refrain from embracing; 

6A time to seek, and a time to lose; 

A time to keep, and a time to cast 
away; 

7A time to rend, and a time to sew; 

A time to keep silence, and a time to 
speak; 

8A time to love, and a time to hate; 

A time for war, and a time for 
peace. 

9What profit hath he that worketh in 
that he laboureth? 10I have seen the 
task which God hath given to the sons 
of men to be exercised therewith. 11He 
hath made every thing beautiful in its 
time; also He hath set the world in 
their heart, yet so that man cannot find 
out the work that God hath done from 
the beginning even to the end. 12I 
know that there is nothing better for 
them, than to rejoice, and to get 
pleasure so long as they live. 13But 
also that every man should eat and 
drink, and enjoy pleasure for all his 
labour, is the gift of God. 14I know 
that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be 
for ever; nothing can be added to it, 
3 




nor any thing taken from it; and God 
hath so made it, that men should fear 
before Him. 15That which is hath been 
long ago, and that which is to be hath 
already been; and God seeketh that 
which is pursued. 

16And moreover I saw under the sun, 
in the place of justice, that wickedness 
was there; and in the place of 
righteousness, that wickedness was 
there. 17I said in my heart: ‘The 
righteous and the wicked God will 
judge; for there is a time there for 
every purpose and for every work.’ 18I 
said in my heart: ‘It is because of the 
sons of men, that God may sift them, 
and that they may see that they 
themselves are but as beasts.’ 19For 
that which befalleth the sons of men 
befalleth beasts; even one thing 
befalleth them; as the one dieth, so 
dieth the other; yea, they have all one 
breath; so that man hath no pre-
eminence above a beast; for all is 
vanity. 20All go unto one place; all are 
of the dust, and all return to dust. 
21Who knoweth the spirit of man 
whether it goeth upward, and the spirit 
of the beast whether it goeth 
downward to the earth? 22Wherefore I 
perceived that there is nothing better, 
than that a man should rejoice in his 
works; for that is his portion; for who 
shall bring him to see what shall be 
after him? 

But I returned and considered all 
the oppressions that are done 
under the sun; and behold the tears of 
such as were oppressed, and they had 
no comforter; and on the side of their 
oppressors there was power, but they 
had no comforter. 2Wherefore I praised 
the dead that are already dead more 
than the living that are yet alive; 3but 
better than they both is he that hath not 
yet been, who hath not seen the evil 
work that is done under the sun. 

4Again, I considered all labour and 
all excelling in work, that it is a man’s 
rivalry with his neighbour. This also is 
vanity and a striving after wind. 

5The fool foldeth his hands together, 

And eateth his own flesh. 

6Better is a handful of quietness, 

Than both the hands full of labour 
and striving after wind. 

7Then I returned and saw vanity 
under the sun. 8There is one that is 
alone, and he hath not a second; yea, 
he hath neither son nor brother; yet is 
there no end of all his labour, neither is 
his eye satisfied with riches: ‘for 
whom then do I labour, and bereave 
my soul of pleasure?’ This also is 
vanity, yea, it is a grievous business. 
9Two are better than one; because they 
have a good reward for their labour. 
10For if they fall, the one will lift up 
his fellow; but woe to him that is alone 
when he falleth, and hath not another 
to lift him up. 11Again, if two lie 
together, then they have warmth; but 
how can one be warm alone? 12And if 
a man prevail against him that is alone, 
two shall withstand him; and a 
threefold cord is not quickly broken. 

13Better is a poor and wise child 
than an old and foolish king, who 
4 




knoweth not how to receive 
admonition any more. 14For out of 
prison he came forth to be king; 
although in his kingdom he was born 
poor. 15I saw all the living that walk 
under the sun, that they were with the 
child, the second, that was to stand up 
in his stead. 16There was no end of all 
the people, even of all them whom he 
did lead; yet they that come after shall 
not rejoice in him. Surely this also is 
vanity and a striving after wind. 

17Guard thy foot when thou goest to 
the house of God, and be ready to 
hearken: it is better than when fools 
give sacrifices; for they know not that 
they do evil. 

Be not rash with thy mouth, and 
let not thy heart be hasty to utter a 
word before God; for God is in 
heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore 
let thy words be few. 

2For a dream cometh through a 
multitude of business; 

And a fool’s voice through a 
multitude of words. 

3When thou vowest a vow unto God, 
defer not to pay it; for He hath no 
pleasure in fools; pay that which thou 
vowest. 4Better is it that thou 
shouldest not vow, than that thou 
shouldest vow and not pay. 5Suffer 
not thy mouth to bring thy flesh into 
guilt, neither say thou before the 
messenger, that it was an error; 
wherefore should God be angry at thy 
voice, and destroy the work of thy 
hands? 6For through the multitude of 
dreams and vanities there are also 
many words; but fear thou God. 

7If thou seest the oppression of the 
poor, and the violent perverting of 
justice and righteousness in the state, 
marvel not at the matter; for one 
higher than the high watcheth, and 
there are higher than they. 8But the 
profit of a land every way is a king 
that maketh himself servant to the 
field. 

9He that loveth silver shall not be 
satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth 
abundance, with increase; this also is 
vanity. 10When goods increase, they 
are increased that eat them; and what 
advantage is there to the owner 
thereof, saving the beholding of them 
with his eyes? 

11Sweet is the sleep of a labouring 
man, whether he eat little or much; but 
the satiety of the rich will not suffer 
him to sleep. 

12There is a grievous evil which I 
have seen under the sun, namely, 
riches kept by the owner thereof to his 
hurt; 13and those riches perish by evil 
adventure; and if he hath begotten a 
son, there is nothing in his hand. 14As 
he came forth of his mother’s womb, 
naked shall he go back as he came, and 
shall take nothing for his labour, which 
he may carry away in his hand. 15And 
this also is a grievous evil, that in all 
points as he came, so shall he go; and 
what profit hath he that he laboureth 
for the wind? 16All his days also he 
eateth in darkness, and he hath much 
vexation and sickness and wrath. 
5 




17Behold that which I have seen: it is 
good, yea, it is comely for one to eat 
and to drink, and to enjoy pleasure for 
all his labour, wherein he laboureth 
under the sun, all the days of his life 
which God hath given him; for this is 
his portion. 18Every man also to whom 
God hath given riches and wealth, and 
hath given him power to eat thereof, 
and to take his portion, and to rejoice 
in his labour—this is the gift of God. 
19For let him remember the days of his 
life that they are not many; for God 
answereth him in the joy of his heart. 

There is an evil which I have seen 
under the sun, and it is heavy 
upon men: 2a man to whom God 
giveth riches, wealth, and honour, so 
that he wanteth nothing for his soul of 
all that he desireth, yet God giveth him 
not power to eat thereof, but a stranger 
eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil 
disease. 3If a man beget a hundred 
children, and live many years, so that 
the days of his years are many, but his 
soul have not enough of good, and 
moreover he have no burial; I say, that 
an untimely birth is better than he; 4for 
it cometh in vanity, and departeth in 
darkness, and the name thereof is 
covered with darkness; 5moreover it 
hath not seen the sun nor known it; 
this hath gratification rather than the 
other; 6yea, though he live a thousand 
years twice told, and enjoy no good; 
do not all go to one place? 

7All the labour of man is for his 
mouth, 

And yet the appetite is not filled. 

8For what advantage hath the wise 
more than the fool? or the poor man 
that hath understanding, in walking 
before the living? 9Better is the seeing 
of the eyes than the wandering of the 
desire; this also is vanity and a striving 
after wind. 

10Whatsoever cometh into being, the 
name thereof was given long ago, and 
it is foreknown what man is; neither 
can he contend with Him that is 
mightier than he. 11Seeing there are 
many words that increase vanity, what 
is man the better? 12For who knoweth 
what is good for man in his life, all the 
days of his vain life which he spendeth 
as a shadow? for who can tell a man 
what shall be after him under the sun? 

 

A good name is better than 
precious oil; 

And the day of death than the day of 
one’s birth. 

2It is better to go to the house of 
mourning, 

Than to go to the house of feasting; 

For that is the end of all men, 

And the living will lay it to his 
heart. 

3Vexation is better than laughter; 

For by the sadness of the 
countenance the heart may be 
gladdened. 

4The heart of the wise is in the 
house of mourning; 

But the heart of fools is in the house 
of mirth. 

5It is better to hear the rebuke of the 
wise, 
6 

7 




Than for a man to hear the song of 
fools. 

6For as the crackling of thorns under 
a pot, so is the laughter of the 
fool; this also is vanity. 

7Surely oppression turneth a wise 
man into a fool; 

And a gift destroyeth the 
understanding. 

8Better is the end of a thing than the 
beginning thereof; 

And the patient in spirit is better 
than the proud in spirit. 

9Be not hasty in thy spirit to be 
angry; 

For anger resteth in the bosom of 
fools. 

10Say not thou: ‘How was it that the 
former days were better than these?’ 
for it is not out of wisdom that thou 
inquirest concerning this. 

11Wisdom is good with an 
inheritance, 

Yea, a profit to them that see the 
sun. 

12For wisdom is a defence, even as 
money is a defence; but the excellency 
of knowledge is, that wisdom 
preserveth the life of him that hath it. 

13Consider the work of God; for 
who can make that straight, which He 
hath made crooked? 14In the day of 
prosperity be joyful, and in the day of 
adversity consider; God hath made 
even the one as well as the other, to 
the end that man should find nothing 
after him. 

15All things have I seen in the days 
of my vanity; there is a righteous man 
that perisheth in his righteousness, and 
there is a wicked man that prolongeth 
his life in his evil-doing. 16Be not 
righteous overmuch; neither make 
thyself overwise; why shouldest thou 
destroy thyself? 17Be not overmuch 
wicked, neither be thou foolish; why 
shouldest thou die before thy time? 18It 
is good that thou shouldest take hold 
of the one; yea, also from the other 
withdraw not thy hand; for he that 
feareth God shall discharge himself of 
them all. 

19Wisdom is a stronghold to the 
wise man more than ten rulers that are 
in a city. 20For there is not a righteous 
man upon earth, that doeth good, and 
sinneth not. 

21Also take not heed unto all words 
that are spoken, lest thou hear thy 
servant curse thee; 22for oftentimes 
also thine own heart knoweth that thou 
thyself likewise hast cursed others. 

23All this have I tried by wisdom; I 
said: ‘I will get wisdom’; but it was far 
from me. 24That which is is far off, and 
exceeding deep; who can find it out? 
25I turned about, and applied my heart 
to know and to search out, and to seek 
wisdom and the reason of things, and 
to know wickedness to be folly, and 
foolishness to be madness; 26and I find 
more bitter than death the woman, 
whose heart is snares and nets, and her 
hands as bands; whoso pleaseth God 
shall escape from her; but the sinner 
shall be taken by her. 27Behold, this 
have I found, saith Koheleth, adding 
one thing to another, to find out the 


account; 28which yet my soul sought, 
but I found not; one man among a 
thousand have I found; but a woman 
among all those have I not found. 
29Behold, this only have I found, that 
God made man upright; but they have 
sought out many inventions. 

 

Who is as the wise man? and who 
knoweth the interpretation of a 
thing? 

A man’s wisdom maketh his face to 
shine, 

And the boldness of his face is 
changed. 

2I [counsel thee]: keep the king’s 
command, and that in regard of the 
oath of God. 3Be not hasty to go out of 
his presence; stand not in an evil thing; 
for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 
4Forasmuch as the king’s word hath 
power; and who may say unto him: 
‘What doest thou?’ 

5Whoso keepeth the commandment 
shall know no evil thing; 

And a wise man’s heart discerneth 
time and judgment. 

6For to every matter there is a time and 
judgment; for the evil of man is great 
upon him. 7For he knoweth not that 
which shall be; for even when it 
cometh to pass, who shall declare it 
unto him? 8There is no man that hath 
power over the wind to retain the 
wind; neither hath he power over the 
day of death; and there is no discharge 
in war; neither shall wickedness 
deliver him that is given to it. 9All this 
have I seen, even applied my heart 
thereto, whatever the work that is done 
under the sun; what time one man had 
power over another to his hurt. 

10And so I saw the wicked buried, and 
they entered into their rest; but they 
that had done right went away from 
the holy place, and were forgotten in 
the city; this also is vanity. 11Because 
sentence against an evil work is not 
executed speedily, therefore the heart 
of the sons of men is fully set in them 
to do evil; 12because a sinner doeth 
evil a hundred times, and prolongeth 
his days—though yet I know that it 
shall be well with them that fear God, 
that fear before Him; 13but it shall not 
be well with the wicked, neither shall 
he prolong his days, which are as a 
shadow, because he feareth not before 
God. 14There is a vanity which is done 
upon the earth: that there are righteous 
men, unto whom it happeneth 
according to the work of the wicked; 
again, there are wicked men, to whom 
it happeneth according to the work of 
the righteous—I said that this also is 
vanity. 15So I commended mirth, that a 
man hath no better thing under the sun, 
than to eat, and to drink, and to be 
merry, and that this should accompany 
him in his labour all the days of his life 
which God hath given him under the 
sun. 

16When I applied my heart to know 
wisdom, and to see the business that is 
done upon the earth—for neither day 
nor night do men see sleep with their 
eyes—17then I beheld all the work of 
God, that man cannot find out the 
8 




work that is done under the sun; 
because though a man labour to seek it 
out, yet he shall not find it; yea further, 
though a wise man think to know it, 
yet shall he not be able to find it. 

For all this I laid to my heart, 
even to make clear all this: that 
the righteous, and the wise, and their 
works, are in the hand of God; whether 
it be love or hatred, man knoweth it 
not; all is before them. 2All things 
come alike to all; there is one event to 
the righteous and to the wicked; to the 
good and to the clean and to the 
unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to 
him that sacrificeth not; as is the good, 
so is the sinner, and he that sweareth, 
as he that feareth an oath. 3This is an 
evil in all that is done under the sun, 
that there is one event unto all; yea 
also, the heart of the sons of men is 
full of evil, and madness is in their 
heart while they live, and after that 
they go to the dead. 

4For to him that is joined to all the 
living there is hope; for a living dog is 
better than a dead lion. 5For the living 
know that they shall die; but the dead 
know not any thing, neither have they 
any more a reward; for the memory of 
them is forgotten. 6As well their love, 
as their hatred and their envy, is long 
ago perished; neither have they any 
more a portion for ever in any thing 
that is done under the sun. 

 

7Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, 

And drink thy wine with a merry 
heart; 

For God hath already accepted thy 
works. 

8Let thy garments be always white; 

And let thy head lack no oil. 

9Enjoy life with the wife whom thou 
lovest all the days of the life of thy 
vanity, which He hath given thee 
under the sun, all the days of thy 
vanity; for that is thy portion in life, 
and in thy labour wherein thou 
labourest under the sun. 10Whatsoever 
thy hand attaineth to do by thy 
strength, that do; for there is no work, 
nor device, nor knowledge, nor 
wisdom, in the grave, whither thou 
goest. 

11I returned, and saw under the sun, 
that the race is not to the swift, nor the 
battle to the strong, neither yet bread 
to the wise, nor yet riches to men of 
understanding, nor yet favour to men 
of skill; but time and chance 
happeneth to them all. 12For man also 
knoweth not his time; as the fishes that 
are taken in an evil net, and as the 
birds that are caught in the snare, even 
so are the sons of men snared in an 
evil time, when it falleth suddenly 
upon them. 

13This also have I seen as wisdom 
under the sun, and it seemed great unto 
me: 14there was a little city, and few 
men within it; and there came a great 
king against it, and besieged it, and 
built great bulwarks against it; 15now 
there was found in it a man poor and 
wise, and he by his wisdom delivered 
the city; yet no man remembered that 
same poor man. 16Then said I: 
9 




‘Wisdom is better than strength; 
nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is 
despised, and his words are not heard.’ 

17The words of the wise spoken in 
quiet 

Are more acceptable than the cry of 
a ruler among fools. 

18Wisdom is better than weapons of 
war; 

But one sinner destroyeth much 
good. 

Dead flies make the ointment 
of the perfumer fetid and 
putrid; 

So doth a little folly outweigh 
wisdom and honour. 

2A wise man’s understanding is at 
his right hand; 

But a fool’s understanding at his 
left. 3Yea also, when a fool walketh by 
the way, his understanding faileth him, 
and he saith to every one that he is a 
fool. 

 

4If the spirit of the ruler rise up 
against thee, 

Leave not thy place; 

For gentleness allayeth great 
offences. 

5There is an evil which I have seen 
under the sun, 

Like an error which proceedeth 
from a ruler: 

6Folly is set on great heights, 

And the rich sit in low place. 

7I have seen servants upon horses, 

And princes walking as servants 
upon the earth. 

 

8He that diggeth a pit shall fall into 
it; 

And whoso breaketh through a 
fence, a serpent shall bite him. 

9Whoso quarrieth stones shall be 
hurt therewith; 

And he that cleaveth wood is 
endangered thereby. 

10If the iron be blunt, 

And one do not whet the edge, 

Then must he put to more strength; 

But wisdom is profitable to direct. 

11If the serpent bite before it is 
charmed, 

Then the charmer hath no 
advantage. 

 

12The words of a wise man’s mouth 
are gracious; 

But the lips of a fool will swallow 
up himself. 

13The beginning of the words of his 
mouth is foolishness; 

And the end of his talk is grievous 
madness. 

14A fool also multiplieth words; 

Yet man knoweth not what shall be; 

And that which shall be after him, 

Who can tell him? 

15The labour of fools wearieth every 
one of them, 

For he knoweth not how to go to the 
city. 

 

16Woe to thee, O land, when thy 
king is a boy, 

And thy princes feast in the 
morning! 
10 




17Happy art thou, O land, when thy 
king is a free man, 

And thy princes eat in due season, 

In strength, and not in drunkenness! 

 

18By slothfulness the rafters sink in; 

And through idleness of the hands 
the house leaketh. 

 

19A feast is made for laughter, 

And wine maketh glad the life; 

And money answereth all things. 

 

20Curse not the king, no, not in thy 
thought, 

And curse not the rich in thy 
bedchamber; 

For a bird of the air shall carry the 
voice, 

And that which hath wings shall tell 
the matter. 

 

Cast thy bread upon the 
waters, 

For thou shalt find it after many 
days. 

2Divide a portion into seven, yea, 
even into eight; 

For thou knowest not what evil shall 
be upon the earth. 

3If the clouds be full of rain, 

They empty themselves upon the 
earth; 

And if a tree fall in the south, or in 
the north, 

In the place where the tree falleth, 
there shall it be. 

4He that observeth the wind shall 
not sow; 

And he that regardeth the clouds 
shall not reap. 

5As thou knowest not what is the 
way of the wind, 

Nor how the bones do grow in the 
womb of her that is with child; 

Even so thou knowest not the work 
of God 

Who doeth all things. 

6In the morning sow thy seed, 

And in the evening withhold not thy 
hand; 

For thou knowest not which shall 
prosper, whether this or that, 

Or whether they both shall be alike 
good. 

7And the light is sweet, 

And a pleasant thing it is for the 
eyes to behold the sun. 

8For if a man live many years, 

Let him rejoice in them all, 

And remember the days of darkness, 

For they shall be many. 

All that cometh is vanity. 

 

9Rejoice, O young man, in thy 
youth; 

And let thy heart cheer thee in the 
days of thy youth, 

And walk in the ways of thy heart, 

And in the sight of thine eyes; 

But know thou, that for all these 
things 

God will bring thee into judgment. 

10Therefore remove vexation from 
thy heart, 

And put away evil from thy flesh; 

For childhood and youth are vanity. 

 
11 




Remember then thy Creator in 
the days of thy youth, 

Before the evil days come, 

And the years draw nigh, when thou 
shalt say: 

‘I have no pleasure in them’; 

2Before the sun, and the light, and 
the moon, 

And the stars, are darkened, 

And the clouds return after the rain; 

3In the day when the keepers of the 
house shall tremble, 

And the strong men shall bow 
themselves, 

And the grinders cease because they 
are few, 

And those that look out shall be 
darkened in the windows, 

4And the doors shall be shut in the 
street, 

When the sound of the grinding is 
low; 

And one shall start up at the voice of 
a bird, 

And all the daughters of music shall 
be brought low; 

5Also when they shall be afraid of 
that which is high, 

And terrors shall be in the way; 

And the almond-tree shall blossom, 

And the grasshopper shall drag itself 
along, 

And the caperberry shall fail; 

Because man goeth to his long 
home, 

And the mourners go about the 
streets; 

6Before the silver cord is snapped 
asunder, 

And the golden bowl is shattered, 

And the pitcher is broken at the 
fountain, 

And the wheel falleth shattered, into 
the pit; 

7And the dust returneth to the earth 
as it was, 

And the spirit returneth unto God 
who gave it. 

8Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth; 
all is vanity. 

 

9And besides that Koheleth was 
wise, he also taught the people 
knowledge; yea, he pondered, and 
sought out, and set in order many 
proverbs. 10Koheleth sought to find out 
words of delight, and that which was 
written uprightly, even words of truth. 

11The words of the wise are as 
goads, and as nails well fastened are 
those that are composed in collections; 
they are given from one shepherd. 
12And furthermore, my son, be 
admonished: of making many books 
there is no end; and much study is a 
weariness of the flesh. 

13The end of the matter, all having 
been heard: fear God, and keep His 
commandments; for this is the whole 
man. 14For God shall bring every work 
into the judgment concerning every 
hidden thing, whether it be good or 
whether it be evil. 

 

The end of the matter, all having been heard: 
fear God, and keep His Commandments; for 
this is the whole man.
