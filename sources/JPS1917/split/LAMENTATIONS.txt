LAMENTATIONS 

 

. HOW DOTH the city sit solitary, 

 That was full of people! 

 How is she become as a widow! 

 She that was great among the 
nations, 

 And princess among the provinces, 

 How is she become tributary! 

. 2She weepeth sore in the night, 

 And her tears are on her cheeks; 

 She hath none to comfort her 

 Among all her lovers; 

 All her friends have dealt 
treacherously with her, 

 They are become her enemies. 

. 3Judah is gone into exile because of 
affliction, 

 And because of great servitude; 

 She dwelleth among the nations, 

 She findeth no rest; 

 All her pursuers overtook her 

 Within the straits. 

. 4The ways of Zion do mourn, 

 Because none come to the solemn 
assembly; 

 All her gates are desolate, 

 Her priests sigh; 

 Her virgins are afflicted, 

 And she herself is in bitterness. 

. 5Her adversaries are become the 
head, 

 Her enemies are at ease; 

 For the LORD hath afflicted her 

 For the multitude of her 
transgressions; 

 Her young children are gone into 
captivity 

 Before the adversary. 

. 6And gone is from the daughter of 
Zion 

 All her splendour; 

 Her princes are become like harts 

 That find no pasture, 

 And they are gone without strength 

 Before the pursuer. 

 

. 7Jerusalem remembereth 

 In the days of her affliction and of 
her anguish 

 All her treasures that she had 

 From the days of old; 

 Now that her people fall by the hand 
of the adversary, 

 And none doth help her, 

 The adversaries have seen her, 

 They have mocked at her 
desolations. 

. 8Jerusalem hath grievously sinned, 

 Therefore she is become as one 
unclean; 

 All that honoured her despise her, 

 Because they have seen her 
nakedness; 

 She herself also sigheth, 

 And turneth backward. 

. 9Her filthiness was in her skirts, 

 She was not mindful of her end; 

 Therefore is she come down 
wonderfully, 

 She hath no comforter. 
1 




 ’Behold, O LORD, my affliction, 

 For the enemy hath magnified 
himself.’ 

. 10The adversary hath spread out his 
hand 

 Upon all her treasures; 

 For she hath seen that the heathen 

 Are entered into her sanctuary, 

 Concerning whom Thou didst 
command 

 That they should not enter into Thy 
congregation. 

. 11All her people sigh, 

 They seek bread; 

 They have given their pleasant 
things for food 

 To refresh the soul. 

 ‘See, O LORD, and behold, 

 How abject I am become.’ 

 

. 12’Let it not come unto you, all ye 
that pass by! 

 Behold, and see 

 If there be any pain like unto my 
pain, 

 Which is done unto me, 

 Wherewith the LORD hath afflicted 
me 

 In the day of His fierce anger. 

. 13From on high hath He sent fire 

 Into my bones, and it prevaileth 
against them; 

 He hath spread a net for my feet, 

 He hath turned me back; 

 He hath made me desolate 

 And faint all the day. 

. 14The yoke of my transgressions is 
impressed by His hand; 

They are knit together, 

They are come up upon my neck; 

He hath made my strength to fail; 

The Lord hath delivered me into 
their hands, 

Against whom I am not able to 
stand. 

. 15The Lord hath set at nought 

All my mighty men in the midst of 
me; 

He hath called a solemn assembly 
against me 

To crush my young men; 

The Lord hath trodden as in a 
winepress 

The virgin the daughter of Judah.’ 

. 16’For these things I weep; 

Mine eye, mine eye runneth down 
with water; 

Because the comforter is far from 
me, 

Even he that should refresh my soul; 

My children are desolate, 

Because the enemy hath prevailed.’ 

. 17Zion spreadeth forth her hands; 

 There is none to comfort her; 

 The LORD hath commanded 
concerning Jacob, 

 That they that are round about him 
should be his adversaries; 

 Jerusalem is among them 

 As one unclean. 

 

. 18’The LORD is righteous; 

For I have rebelled against His 
word; 

Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, 

 And behold my pain: 

 My virgins and my young men 

 Are gone into captivity. 


. 19I called for my lovers, 

But they deceived me; 

My priests and mine elders 

Perished in the city, 

While they sought them food 

To refresh their souls. 

. 20Behold, O LORD, for I am in 
distress, 

Mine inwards burn; 

My heart is turned within me, 

For I have grievously rebelled. 

Abroad the sword bereaveth, 

At home there is the like of death. 

. 21They have heard that I sigh, 

There is none to comfort me; 

All mine enemies have heard of my 
trouble, and are glad, 

For Thou hast done it; 

Thou wilt bring the day that Thou 
hast proclaimed, 

And they shall be like unto me. 

. 22Let all their wickedness come 
before Thee; 

And do unto them, 

As Thou hast done unto me 

For all my transgressions; 

For my sighs are many 

And my heart is faint.’ 

 

. How hath the Lord covered 
with a cloud 

The daughter of Zion in His anger! 

He hath cast down from heaven unto 
the earth 

The beauty of Israel, 

And hath not remembered His 
footstool 

In the day of His anger. 

. 2The Lord hath swallowed up 
unsparingly 

All the habitations of Jacob; 

He hath thrown down in His wrath 

The strongholds of the daughter of 
Judah; 

He hath brought them down to the 
ground; 

He hath profaned the kingdom and 
the princes thereof. 

. 3He hath cut off in fierce anger 

All the horn of Israel; 

He hath drawn back His right hand 

From before the enemy; 

And He hath burned in Jacob like a 
flaming fire, 

Which devoureth round about. 

. 4He hath bent His bow like an 
enemy, 

Standing with His right hand as an 
adversary, 

And hath slain all that were pleasant 
to the eye; 

In the tent of the daughter of Zion 

He hath poured out His fury like 
fire. 

. 5The Lord is become as an enemy, 

He hath swallowed up Israel; 

He hath swallowed up all her 
palaces, 

He hath destroyed his strongholds; 

And He hath multiplied in the 
daughter of Judah 

Mourning and moaning. 

. 6And He hath stripped His 
tabernacle, as if it were a garden, 

He hath destroyed His place of 
assembly; 
2 




The LORD hath caused to be 
forgotten in Zion 

Appointed season and sabbath, 

And hath rejected in the indignation 
of His anger 

The king and the priest. 

. 7The Lord hath cast off His altar, 

He hath abhorred His sanctuary, 

He hath given up into the hand of 
the enemy 

The walls of her palaces; 

They have made a noise in the 
house of the LORD, 

As in the day of a solemn assembly. 

. 8The LORD hath purposed to destroy 

The wall of the daughter of Zion; 

He hath stretched out the line, 

He hath not withdrawn 

His hand from destroying; 

But He hath made the rampart and 
wall to mourn, 

They languish together. 

. 9Her gates are sunk into the ground; 

He hath destroyed and broken her 
bars; 

Her king and her princes are among 
the nations, 

Instruction is no more; 

Yea, her prophets find 

No vision from the LORD. 

. 10They sit upon the ground, and 
keep silence, 

The elders of the daughter of Zion; 

They have cast up dust upon their 
heads, 

They have girded themselves with 
sackcloth; 

The virgins of Jerusalem hang down 

Their heads to the ground. 

. 11Mine eyes do fail with tears, 

Mine inwards burn, 

My liver is poured upon the earth, 

For the breach of the daughter of my 
people; 

Because the young children and the 
sucklings swoon 

In the broad places of the city. 

. 12They say to their mothers: 

‘Where is corn and wine?’ 

When they swoon as the wounded 

In the broad places of the city, 

When their soul is poured out 

Into their mothers’bosom. 

. 13What shall I take to witness for 
thee? 

What shall I liken to thee, 

O daughter of Jerusalem? 

What shall I equal to thee, that I 
may comfort thee, 

O virgin daughter of Zion? 

For thy breach is great like the sea; 

Who can heal thee? 

. 14Thy prophets have seen visions for 
thee 

Of vanity and delusion; 

And they have not uncovered thine 
iniquity, 

To bring back thy captivity; 

But have prophesied for thee 
burdens 

Of vanity and seduction. 

. 15All that pass by clap 

Their hands at thee; 

They hiss and wag their head 

At the daughter of Jerusalem: 

‘Is this the city that men called 

The perfection of beauty, 

The joy of the whole earth?’ 


. 16All thine enemies have opened 

Their mouth wide against thee; 

They hiss and gnash the teeth; 

They say: ‘We have swallowed her 
up; 

Certainly this is the day that we 
looked for; 

We have found, we have seen it.’ 

. 17The LORD hath done that which He 
devised; 

He hath performed His word 

That He commanded in the days of 
old; 

He hath thrown down unsparingly; 

And He hath caused the enemy to 
rejoice over thee, 

He hath exalted the horn of thine 
adversaries. 

 

. 18Their heart cried unto the Lord: 

‘O wall of the daughter of Zion, 

Let tears run down like a river 

Day and night; 

Give thyself no respite; 

Let not the apple of thine eye cease. 

. 19Arise, cry out in the night, 

At the beginning of the watches; 

Pour out thy heart like water 

Before the face of the Lord; 

Lift up thy hands toward Him 

For the life of thy young children, 

That faint for hunger 

At the head of every street.’ 

. 20’See, O LORD, and consider, 

To whom Thou hast done thus! 

Shall the women eat their fruit, 

The children that are dandled in the 
hands? 

Shall the priest and the prophet be 
slain 

In the sanctuary of the Lord? 

. 21The youth and the old man lie 

On the ground in the streets; 

My virgins and my young men 

Are fallen by the sword; 

Thou hast slain them in the day of 
Thine anger; 

Thou hast slaughtered unsparingly. 

. 22Thou hast called, as in the day of a 
solemn assembly, 

My terrors on every side, 

And there was none in the day of the 
LORD’S anger 

That escaped or remained; 

Those that I have dandled and 
brought up 

Hath mine enemy consumed.’ 

 

. 

I am the man that hath seen 
affliction 

By the rod of His wrath. 

2He hath led me and caused me to 
walk in darkness and not in light. 

3Surely against me He turneth His 
hand again and again all the day. 

. 

4My flesh and my skin hath He 
worn out; 

He hath broken my bones. 

5He hath builded against me, and 
compassed me 

With gall and travail. 

6He hath made me to dwell in dark 
places, 

As those that have been long dead. 

. 
3 




7He hath hedged me about, that I 
cannot go forth; 

He hath made my chain heavy. 

8Yea, when I cry and call for help, 
He shutteth out my prayer. 

9He hath enclosed my ways with 
hewn stone, 

He hath made my paths crooked. 

. 

10He is unto me as a bear lying in 
wait, 

As a lion in secret places. 

11He hath turned aside my ways, and 
pulled me in pieces; 

He hath made me desolate. 

12He hath bent His bow, and set me 

As a mark for the arrow. 

. 

13He hath caused the arrows of His 
quiver 

To enter into my reins. 

14I am become a derision to all my 
people, 

And their song all the day. 

15He hath filled me with bitterness, 

He hath sated me with wormwood. 

. 

16He hath also broken my teeth with 
gravel stones, 

He hath made me to wallow in 
ashes. 

17And my soul is removed far off 
from peace, 

I forgot prosperity. 

18And I said: ‘My strength is 
perished, 

And mine expectation from the 
LORD.’ 

. 

19Remember mine affliction and 
mine anguish, 

The wormwood and the gall. 

20My soul hath them still in 
remembrance, 

And is bowed down within me. 

21This I recall to my mind, 
Therefore have I hope. 

. 

22Surely the LORD’S mercies are not 
consumed, 

Surely His compassions fail not. 

23They are new every morning; 

Great is Thy faithfulness. 

24’The LORD is my portion’, saith my 
soul; 

‘Therefore will I hope in Him.’ 

. 

25The LORD is good unto them that 
wait for Him, 

To the soul that seeketh Him. 

26It is good that a man should 
quietly wait 

For the salvation of the LORD. 

27It is good for a man that he bear 

The yoke in his youth. 

. 

28Let him sit alone and keep silence, 

Because He hath laid it upon him. 

29Let him put his mouth in the dust, 

If so be there may be hope. 

30Let him give his cheek to him that 
smiteth him 

Let him be filled full with reproach. 

. 

31For the Lord will not cast off 

For ever. 

32For though He cause grief, yet will 
He have compassion 


According to the multitude of His 
mercies. 

33For He doth not afflict willingly, 

Nor grieve the children of men. 

. 

34To crush under foot 

All the prisoners of the earth, 

35To turn aside the right of a man 

Before the face of the Most High, 

36To subvert a man in his cause, 

The Lord approveth not. 

. 

37Who is he that saith, and it cometh 
to pass, 

When the Lord commandeth it not? 

38Out of the mouth of the Most High 
proceedeth not 

Evil and good? 

39Wherefore doth a living man 
complain, 

A strong man because of his sins? 

. 

40Let us search and try our ways, 

And return to the LORD. 

41Let us lift up our heart with our 
hands 

Unto God in the heavens. 

42We have transgressed and have 
rebelled; 

Thou hast not pardoned. 

. 

43Thou hast covered with anger and 
pursued us; 

Thou hast slain unsparingly. 

44Thou hast covered Thyself with a 
cloud, 

So that no prayer can pass through. 

45Thou hast made us as the 
offscouring and refuse 

In the midst of the peoples. 

. 

46All our enemies have opened their 
mouth 

Wide against us. 

47Terror and the pit are come upon 
us, 

Desolation and destruction. 

48Mine eye runneth down with rivers 
of water, 

For the breach of the daughter of my 
people. 

. 

49Mine eye is poured out, and 
ceaseth not, 

Without any intermission, 

50Till the LORD look forth, 

And behold from heaven. 

51Mine eye affected my soul, 

Because of all the daughters of my 
city. 

. 

52They have chased me sore like a 
bird, 

That are mine enemies without 
cause. 

53They have cut off my life in the 
dungeon, 

And have cast stones upon me. 

54Waters flowed over my head; 

I said: ‘I am cut off.’ 

. 

55I called upon Thy name, O LORD, 

Out of the lowest dungeon. 

56Thou heardest my voice; hide not 

Thine ear at my sighing, at my cry. 

57Thou drewest near in the day that I 
called upon Thee; 

Thou saidst: ‘Fear not.’ 


. 

58O Lord, Thou hast pleaded the 
causes of my soul; 

Thou hast redeemed my life. 

59O LORD, Thou hast seen my 
wrong; 

Judge Thou my cause. 

60Thou hast seen all their vengeance 

And all their devices against me. 

. 

61Thou hast heard their taunt, O 
LORD, 

And all their devices against me; 

62The lips of those that rose up 
against me, 

And their muttering against me all 
the day. 

63Behold Thou their sitting down, 
and their rising up; 

I am their song. 

. 

64Thou wilt render unto them a 
recompense, O LORD, 

According to the work of their 
hands. 

65Thou wilt give them hardness of 
heart, 

Thy curse unto them. 

66Thou wilt pursue them in anger, 
and destroy them 

From under the heavens of the LORD. 

 

. How is the gold become dim! 

How is the most fine gold 
changed! 

The hallowed stones are poured out 

At the head of every street. 

. 2The precious sons of Zion, 

Comparable to fine gold, 

How are they esteemed as earthen 
pitchers, 

The work of the hands of the potter! 

. 3Even the jackals draw out the 
breast, 

They give suck to their young ones; 

The daughter of my people is 
become cruel, 

Like the ostriches in the wilderness. 

. 4The tongue of the sucking child 
cleaveth 

To the roof of his mouth for thirst; 

The young children ask bread, 

And none breaketh it unto them. 

. 5They that did feed on dainties 

Are desolate in the streets; 

They that were brought up in scarlet 

Embrace dunghills. 

. 6For the iniquity of the daughter of 
my people is greater 

Than the sin of Sodom, 

That was overthrown as in a 
moment, 

And no hands fell upon her. 

. 7Her princes were purer than snow, 

They were whiter than milk, 

They were more ruddy in body than 
rubies, 

Their polishing was as of sapphire; 

. 8Their visage is blacker than a coal; 

They are not known in the streets; 

Their skin is shrivelled upon their 
bones; 

It is withered, it is become like a 
stick. 

. 9They that are slain with the sword 
are better 

Than they that are slain with hunger; 
4 




For these pine away, stricken 
through, 

For want of the fruits of the field. 

. 10The hands of women full of 
compassion 

Have sodden their own children; 

They were their food 

In the destruction of the daughter of 
my people. 

 

. 11The LORD hath accomplished His 
fury, 

He hath poured out His fierce anger; 

And He hath kindled a fire in Zion, 

Which hath devoured the 
foundations thereof. 

. 12The kings of the earth believed 
not, 

Neither all the inhabitants of the 
world, 

That the adversary and the enemy 
would enter 

Into the gates of Jerusalem. 

. 13It is because of the sins of her 
prophets, 

And the iniquities of her priests, 

That have shed the blood of the just 

In the midst of her. 

. 14They wander as blind men in the 
streets, 

They are polluted with blood, 

So that men cannot 

Touch their garments. 

. 15’Depart ye! unclean! ’ men cried 
unto them, 

‘Depart, depart, touch not’; 

Yea, they fled away and wandered; 

Men said among the nations: 

‘They shall no more sojourn here.’ 

. 16The anger of the LORD hath divided 
them; 

He will no more regard them; 

They respected not the persons of 
the priests, 

They were not gracious unto the 
elders. 

 

. 17As for us, our eyes do yet fail 

For our vain help; 

In our watching we have watched 

For a nation that could not save. 

. 18They hunt our steps, 

That we cannot go in our broad 
places; 

Our end is near, our days are 
fulfilled; 

For our end is come. 

. 19Our pursuers were swifter 

Than the eagles of the heaven; 

They chased us upon the mountains, 

They lay in wait for us in the 
wilderness. 

. 20The breath of our nostrils, the 
anointed of the LORD, 

Was taken in their pits; 

Of whom we said: ‘Under his 
shadow 

We shall live among the nations.’ 

. 21Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of 
Edom, 

That dwellest in the land of Uz: 

The cup shall pass over unto thee 
also; 

Thou shalt be drunken, and shalt 
make thyself naked. 

. 22The punishment of thine iniquity is 
accomplished, O daughter of 
Zion, 


He will no more carry thee away 
into captivity; 

He will punish thine iniquity, O 
daughter of Edom, 

He will uncover thy sins. 

 

Remember, O LORD, what is come 
upon us; 

Behold, and see our reproach. 

2Our inheritance is turned unto 
strangers, 

Our houses unto aliens. 

3We are become orphans and 
fatherless, 

Our mothers are as widows. 

4We have drunk our water for 
money; 

Our wood cometh to us for price. 

5To our very necks we are pursued; 

We labour, and have no rest. 

6We have given the hand to Egypt, 

And to Assyria, to have bread 
enough; 

7Our fathers have sinned, and are 
not; 

And we have borne their iniquities. 

8Servants rule over us; 

There is none to deliver us out of 
their hand. 

9We get our bread with the peril of 
our lives 

Because of the sword of the 
wilderness. 

10Our skin is hot like an oven 

Because of the burning heat of 
famine. 

11They have ravished the women in 
Zion, 

The maidens in the cities of Judah. 

12Princes are hanged up by their 
hand; 

The faces of elders are not 
honoured. 

13The young men have borne the 
mill, 

And the children have stumbled 
under the wood. 

14The elders have ceased from the 
gate, 

The young men from their music. 

15The joy of our heart is ceased; 

Our dance is turned into mourning. 

16The crown is fallen from our head; 

Woe unto us! for we have sinned. 

 

17For this our heart is faint, 

For these things our eyes are dim; 

18For the mountain of Zion, which is 
desolate, 

The foxes walk upon it. 

19Thou, O LORD, art enthroned for 
ever, 

Thy throne is from generation to 
generation. 

20Wherefore dost Thou forget us for 
ever, 

And forsake us so long time? 

21Turn Thou us unto Thee, O LORD, 
and we shall be turned; 

Renew our days as of old. 

22Thou canst not have utterly 
rejected us, 

And be exceeding wroth against us! 

 

Turn us unto Thee, O Lord, and we shall be 
turned; 

Renew our days as of old.
