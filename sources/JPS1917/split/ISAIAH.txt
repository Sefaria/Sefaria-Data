ISAIAH 

 

The Vision of Isaiah the son of 
Amoz, which he saw concerning 
Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of 
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, 
kings of Judah. 

 

2Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O 
earth, 

For the LORD hath spoken: 

Children I have reared, and brought 
up, 

And they have rebelled against Me. 

3The ox knoweth his owner, 

And the ass his master’s crib; 

But Israel doth not know, 

My people doth not consider. 

 

4Ah sinful nation, 

A people laden with iniquity, 

A seed of evil-doers, 

Children that deal corruptly; 

They have forsaken the LORD, 

They have contemned the Holy One 
of 

Israel, 

They are turned away backward. 

5On what part will ye yet be 
stricken, 

Seeing ye stray away more and 
more? 

The whole head is sick, 

And the whole heart faint; 

6From the sole of the foot even unto 
the head 

There is no soundness in it; 

But wounds, and bruises, and 
festering sores: 

They have not been pressed, neither 
bound up, 

Neither mollified with oil. 

7Your country is desolate; 

Your cities are burned with fire; 

Your land, strangers devour it in 
your presence, 

And it is desolate, as overthrown by 

 floods. 

8And the daughter of Zion is left 

As a booth in a vineyard, 

As a lodge in a garden of 
cucumbers, 

As a besieged city. 

9Except the LORD of hosts 

Had left unto us a very small 
remnant, 

We should have been as Sodom, 

We should have been like unto 
Gomorrah. 

 

10Hear the word of the LORD, 

Ye rulers of Sodom; 

Give ear unto the law of our God, 

Ye people of Gomorrah. 

11To what purpose is the multitude 
of your sacrifices unto Me? 

Saith the LORD; 

I am full of the burnt-offerings of 
rams, 

And the fat of fed beasts; 
1 




And I delight not in the blood 

Of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-
goats. 

12When ye come to appear before 
Me, 

Who hath required this at your hand, 

To trample My courts? 

13Bring no more vain oblations; 

It is an offering of abomination unto 
Me; 

New moon and sabbath, the holding 
of convocations— 

I cannot endure iniquity along with 
the solemn assembly. 

14Your new moons and your 
appointed seasons 

My soul hateth; 

They are a burden unto Me; 

I am weary to bear them. 

15And when ye spread forth your 
hands, 

I will hide Mine eyes from you; 

Yea, when ye make many prayers, 

I will not hear; 

Your hands are full of blood. 

16Wash you, make you clean, 

Put away the evil of your doings 

From before Mine eyes, 

Cease to do evil; 

17Learn to do well; 

Seek justice, relieve the oppressed, 

Judge the fatherless, plead for the 
widow. 

 

18Come now, and let us reason 
together, 

Saith the LORD; 

Though your sins be as scarlet, 

They shall be as white as snow; 

Though they be red like crimson, 

They shall be as wool. 

19If ye be willing and obedient, 

Ye shall eat the good of the land; 

20But if ye refuse and rebel, 

Ye shall be devoured with the 
sword; 

For the mouth of the LORD hath 
spoken. 

 

21How is the faithful city 

Become a harlot! 

She that was full of justice, 

Righteousness lodged in her, 

But now murderers. 

22Thy silver is become dross, 

Thy wine mixed with water. 

23Thy princes are rebellious, 

And companions of thieves; 

Every one loveth bribes, 

And followeth after rewards; 

They judge not the fatherless, 

Neither doth the cause of the widow 
come unto them. 

 

24Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD 
of hosts, 

The Mighty One of Israel: 

Ah, I will ease Me of Mine 
adversaries, 

And avenge Me of Mine enemies; 

25And I will turn My hand upon 
thee, 

And purge away thy dross as with 
lye, 

And will take away all thine alloy; 

26And I will restore thy judges as at 
the first, 


And thy counsellors as at the 
beginning; 

Afterward thou shalt be called The 
city of righteousness, 

The faithful city. 

27Zion shall be redeemed with 
justice, 

And they that return of her with 

 righteousness. 

28But the destruction of the 
transgressors and the sinners shall 
be together, 

And they that forsake the LORD shall 
be consumed. 

29For they shall be ashamed of the 

 terebinths which ye have desired, 

And ye shall be confounded for the 
gardens that ye have chosen. 

30For ye shall be as a terebinth 
whose leaf fadeth, 

And as a garden that hath no water. 

31And the strong shall be as tow, 

And his work as a spark; 

And they shall both burn together, 

And none shall quench them. 

 

The word that Isaiah the son of 
Amoz saw concerning Judah and 
Jerusalem. 

 

2And it shall come to pass in the end 
of days, 

That the mountain of the LORD’S 
house 

Shall be established as the top of the 
mountains, 

And shall be exalted above the hills; 

And all nations shall flow unto it. 

3And many peoples shall go and 
say: 

‘Come ye, and let us go up to the 
mountain of the LORD, 

To the house of the God of Jacob; 

And He will teach us of His ways, 

And we will walk in His paths.’ 

For out of Zion shall go forth the 
law, 

And the word of the LORD from 
Jerusalem. 

4And He shall judge between the 
nations, 

And shall decide for many peoples; 

And they shall beat their swords into 

 plowshares, 

And their spears into pruninghooks; 

Nation shall not lift up sword 
against nation, 

Neither shall they learn war any 
more. 

 

5O house of Jacob, come ye, and let 
us walk 

In the light of the LORD. 

6For Thou hast forsaken Thy people 
the house of Jacob; 

For they are replenished from the 
east, 

And with soothsayers like the 
Philistines, 

And they please themselves in the 
brood of aliens. 

7Their land also is full of silver and 
gold, 

Neither is there any end of their 
treasures; 

Their land also is full of horses, 
2 




Neither is there any end of their 
chariots. 

8Their land also is full of idols; 

Every one worshippeth the work of 
his own hands, 

That which his own fingers have 
made. 

9And man boweth down, 

And man lowereth himself; 

And Thou canst not bear with them. 

10Enter into the rock, 

And hide thee in the dust, 

From before the terror of the LORD, 

And from the glory of His majesty. 

11The lofty looks of man shall be 
brought low, 

And the haughtiness of men shall be 
bowed down, 

And the LORD alone shall be exalted 
in that day. 

 

12For the LORD of hosts hath a day 

Upon all that is proud and lofty, 

And upon all that is lifted up, and it 
shall be brought low; 

13And upon all the cedars of 
Lebanon 

That are high and lifted up, 

And upon all the oaks of Bashan; 

14And upon all the high mountains, 

And upon all the hills that are lifted 
up; 15And upon every lofty tower, 

And upon every fortified wall; 

16And upon all the ships of Tarshish, 

And upon all delightful imagery. 

17And the loftiness of man shall be 
bowed down, 

And the haughtiness of men shall be 
brought low; 

And the LORD alone shall be exalted 
in that day. 

 

18And the idols shall utterly pass 
away. 

19And men shall go into the caves of 
the rocks, 

And into the holes of the earth, 

From before the terror of the LORD, 

And from the glory of His majesty, 

When He ariseth to shake mightily 
the earth. 

20In that day a man shall cast away 

His idols of silver, and his idols of 
gold, 

Which they made for themselves to 
worship, 

To the moles and to the bats; 

21To go into the clefts of the rocks, 

And into the crevices of the crags, 

From before the terror of the LORD, 

And from the glory of His majesty, 

When he ariseth to shake mightily 
the earth. 

 

22Cease ye from man, in whose 
nostrils is a breath; 

For how little is he to be accounted! 

 

For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of 
hosts, 

Doth take away from Jerusalem and 
from Judah 

Stay and staff, 

Every stay of bread, and every stay 
of water; 

2The mighty man, and the man of 
war; 

The judge, and the prophet, 
3 




And the diviner, and the elder; 

3The captain of fifty, and the man of 
rank, 

And the counsellor, and the cunning 
charmer, and the skilful 
enchanter. 

4And I will give children to be their 
princes, 

And babes shall rule over them. 

5And the people shall oppress one 
another, 

Every man his fellow, and every 
man his neighbour; 

The child shall behave insolently 
against the aged, 

And the base against the 
honourable, 

6For a man shall take hold of his 
brother of the house of his father: 

‘Thou hast a mantle, 

Be thou our ruler, 

And let this ruin be under thy hand.’ 

7In that day shall he swear, saying: 

‘I will not be a healer; 

For in my house is neither bread nor 
a mantle; 

Ye shall not make me ruler of a 
people.’ 

8For Jerusalem is ruined, 

And Judah is fallen; 

Because their tongue and their 
doings are against the LORD, 

To provoke the eyes of His glory. 

 

9The show of their countenance doth 
witness against them; 

And they declare their sin as 
Sodom, they hide it not. 

Woe unto their soul! 

For they have wrought evil unto 
themselves. 

10Say ye of the righteous, that it 
shall be well with him; 

For they shall eat the fruit of their 
doings. 

11Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill 
with him; 

For the work of his hands shall be 
done to him. 

12As for My people, a babe is their 
master, 

And women rule over them. 

O My people, they that lead thee 
cause thee to err, 

And destroy the way of thy paths. 

 

13The LORD standeth up to plead, 

And standeth to judge the peoples. 

14The LORD will enter into judgment 

With the elders of His people, and 
the princes thereof: 

‘It is ye that have eaten up the 
vineyard; The spoil of the poor is 
in your houses; 

15What mean ye that ye crush My 
people, 

And grind the face of the poor?’ 

Saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts. 

16Moreover the LORD said: 

Because the daughters of Zion are 
haughty, 

And walk with stretched-forth necks 

And wanton eyes, 

Walking and mincing as they go, 

And making a tinkling with their 
feet; 

17Therefore the Lord will smite with 
a scab 


The crown of the head of the 
daughters of Zion, 

And the LORD will lay bare their 
secret parts. 

18In that day the Lord will take away 
the bravery of their anklets, and the 
fillets, and the crescents; 19the 
pendants, and the bracelets, and the 
veils; 20the headtires, and the armlets, 
and the sashes, and the corselets, and 
the amulets; 21the rings, and the nose-
jewels; 22the aprons, and the mantelets, 
and the cloaks, and the girdles; 23and 
the gauze robes, and the fine linen, and 
the turbans, and the mantles. 24And it 
shall come to pass, that 

Instead of sweet spices there shall 
be rottenness; 

And instead of a girdle rags; 

And instead of curled hair baldness; 

And instead of a stomacher a 
girding of sackcloth; 

Branding instead of beauty. 

25Thy men shall fall by the sword, 

And thy mighty in the war. 

26And her gates shall lament and 
mourn; 

And utterly bereft she shall sit upon 
the ground. 

 

And seven women shall take hold 
of one man in that day, saying: 
‘We will eat our own bread, and wear 
our own apparel; only let us be called 
by thy name; take thou away our 
reproach.’ 

2In that day shall the growth of the 
LORD be beautiful and glorious, 

And the fruit of the land excellent 
and comely 

For them that are escaped of Israel. 

3And it shall come to pass, that he 
that is left in Zion, and he that 
remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called 
holy, even every one that is written 
unto life in Jerusalem; 4when the Lord 
shall have washed away the filth of the 
daughters of Zion, and shall have 
purged the blood of Jerusalem from 
the midst thereof, by the spirit of 
judgment, and by the spirit of 
destruction. 5And the LORD will create 
over the whole habitation of mount 
Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud 
and smoke by day, and the shining of a 
flaming fire by night; for over all the 
glory shall be a canopy. 6And there 
shall be a pavilion for a shadow in the 
day-time from the heat, and for a 
refuge and for a covert from storm and 
from rain. 

 

Let me sing of my well-beloved, 

A song of my beloved touching 
his vineyard. 

My well-beloved had a vineyard 

In a very fruitful hill; 

2And he digged it, and cleared it of 
stones, 

And planted it with the choicest 
vine, 

And built a tower in the midst of it, 

And also hewed out a vat therein; 

And he looked that it should bring 
forth grapes, 

And it brought forth wild grapes. 

 
4 

5 




3And now, O inhabitants of 
Jerusalem and men of Judah, 

Judge, I pray you, betwixt me and 
my vineyard. 

4What could have been done more 
to my vineyard, 

That I have not done in it? 

Wherefore, when I looked that it 
should bring forth grapes, 

Brought it forth wild grapes? 

 

5And now come, I will tell you 

What I will do to my vineyard: 

I will take away the hedge thereof, 

And it shall be eaten up; 

I will break down the fence thereof, 

And it shall be trodden down; 

6And I will lay it waste: 

It shall not be pruned nor hoed, 

But there shall come up briers and 
thorns; 

I will also command the clouds 

That they rain no rain upon it. 

 

7For the vineyard of the LORD of 
hosts is the house of Israel, 

And the men of Judah the plant of 
His delight; 

And He looked for justice, but 
behold violence; 

For righteousness, but behold a cry. 

 

8Woe unto them that join house to 
house, 

That lay field to field, 

Till there be no room, and ye be 
made to dwell 

Alone in the midst of the land! 

9In mine ears said the LORD of hosts: 

Of a truth many houses shall be 
desolate, 

Even great and fair, without 
inhabitant. 

10For ten acres of vineyard shall 
yield one bath, 

And the seed of a homer shall yield 
an ephah. 

 

11Woe unto them that rise up early 
in the morning, 

That they may follow strong drink; 

That tarry late into the night, 

Till wine inflame them! 

12And the harp and the psaltery, the 
tabret and the pipe, 

And wine, are in their feasts; 

But they regard not the work of the 
LORD, 

Neither have they considered the 
operation of His hands. 

13Therefore My people are gone into 
captivity, 

For want of knowledge; 

And their honourable men are 
famished, 

And their multitude are parched 
with thirst. 

14Therefore the nether-world hath 
enlarged her desire, 

And opened her mouth without 
measure; 

And down goeth their glory, and 
their tumult, and their uproar, 

And he that rejoiceth among them. 

15And man is bowed down, 

And man is humbled, 

And the eyes of the lofty are 
humbled; 


16But the LORD of hosts is exalted 
through justice, 

And God the Holy One is sanctified 
through righteousness. 

17Then shall the lambs feed as in 
their pasture, 

And the waste places of the fat ones 
shall wanderers eat. 

 

18Woe unto them that draw iniquity 
with cords of vanity, 

And sin as it were with a cart rope, 

19That say: ‘Let Him make speed, let 
Him hasten His work, 

That we may see it; 

And let the counsel of the Holy One 
of Israel draw nigh and come, 

That we may know it! ’ 

 

20Woe unto them that call evil good, 

And good evil; 

That change darkness into light, 

And light into darkness; 

That change bitter into sweet, 

And sweet into bitter! 

 

21Woe unto them that are wise in 
their own eyes, 

And prudent in their own sight! 

 

22Woe unto them that are mighty to 
drink wine, 

And men of strength to mingle 
strong drink; 

23That justify the wicked for a 
reward, 

And take away the righteousness of 
the righteous from him! 

24Therefore as the tongue of fire 
devoureth the stubble, 

And as the chaff is consumed in the 
flame, 

So their root shall be as rottenness, 

And their blossom shall go up as 
dust; 

Because they have rejected the law 
of the LORD of hosts, 

And contemned the word of the 
Holy One of Israel. 

 

25Therefore is the anger of the LORD 
kindled against His people, 

And He hath stretched forth His 
hand against them, and hath 
smitten them, 

And the hills did tremble, 

And their carcasses were as refuse 
in the midst of the streets. 

For all this His anger is not turned 
away, 

But His hand is stretched out still. 

 

26And He will lift up an ensign to 
the nations from far, 

And will hiss unto them from the 
end of the earth; 

And, behold, they shall come with 
speed swiftly; 

27None shall be weary nor stumble 
among them; 

None shall slumber nor sleep; 

Neither shall the girdle of their loins 
be loosed, 

Nor the latchet of their shoes be 
broken; 28Whose arrows are 
sharp, 

And all their bows bent; 


Their horses’hoofs shall be counted 
like flint, 

And their wheels like a whirlwind; 

29Their roaring shall be like a lion, 

They shall roar like young lions, 
yea, they shall roar, 

And lay hold of the prey, and carry 
it away safe, 

And there shall be none to deliver. 

30And they shall roar against them in 
that day 

Like the roaring of the sea; 

And if one look unto the land, 

Behold darkness and distress, 

And the light is darkened in the 
skies thereof. 

 

In the year that king Uzziah died I 
saw the Lord sitting upon a throne 
high and lifted up, and His train filled 
the temple. 2Above Him stood the 
seraphim; each one had six wings: 
with twain he covered his face and 
with twain he covered his feet, and 
with twain he did fly. 3And one called 
unto another, and said: 

Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of 
hosts; 

The whole earth is full of His glory. 

4And the posts of the door were 
moved at the voice of them that called, 
and the house was filled with smoke. 
5Then said I: 

Woe is me! for I am undone; 

Because I am a man of unclean lips, 

And I dwell in the midst of a people 
of 

unclean lips; 

For mine eyes have seen the King, 

The LORD of hosts. 

6Then flew unto me one of the 
seraphim, with a glowing stone in his 
hand, which he had taken with the 
tongs from off the altar; 7and he 
touched my mouth with it, and said: 

Lo, this hath touched thy lips; 

And thine iniquity is taken away, 

And thy sin expiated. 

8And I heard the voice of the Lord, 
saying: 

Whom shall I send, 

And who will go for us? 

Then I said: ‘Here am I; send me.’ 
9And He said: ‘Go, and tell this 
people: 

Hear ye indeed, but understand not; 

And see ye indeed, but perceive not. 

10Make the heart of this people fat, 

And make their ears heavy, 

And shut their eyes; 

Lest they, seeing with their eyes, 

And hearing with their ears, 

And understanding with their heart, 

Rreturn, and be healed.’ 

11Then said I: ‘Lord, how long?’ 
And He answered: 

‘Until cities be waste without 
inhabitant, 

And houses without man, 

And the land become utterly waste, 

12And the LORD have removed men 
far away, 

And the forsaken places be many in 
the midst of the land. 

13And if there be yet a tenth in it, it 
shall again be eaten up; as a terebinth, 
and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, 
6 




when they cast their leaves, so the holy 
seed shall be the stock thereof.’ 

 

7 



And it came to pass in the days of 
Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son 
of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin 
the king of Aram, and Pekah the son of 
Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to 
Jerusalem to war against it; but could 
not prevail against it. 2And it was told 
the house of David, saying: ‘Aram is 
confederate with Ephraim.’ And his 
heart was moved, and the heart of his 
people, as the trees of the forest are 
moved with the wind. 

3Then said the LORD unto Isaiah: 
‘Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and 
aShear-jashub thy son, at the end of the 
conduit of the upper pool, in the 
highway of the fullers’field; 4and say 
unto him: Keep calm, and be quiet; 
fear not, neither let thy heart be faint, 
because of these two tails of smoking 
firebrands, for the fierce anger of 
Rezin and Aram, and of the son of 
Remaliah. 5Because Aram hath 
counselled evil against thee, Ephraim 
also, and the son of Remaliah, saying: 
6Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, 
and let us make a breach therein for us, 
and set up a king in the midst of it, 
even the son of Tabeel; 7thus saith the 
Lord GOD: 

a That is, A remnant shall return. 

It shall not stand, neither shall it 
come to pass. 

8For the head of Aram is Damascus, 

And the head of Damascus is Rezin; 

And within threescore and five 
years 

Shall Ephraim be broken, that it be 
not a people; 

9And the head of Ephraim is 
Samaria, 

And the head of Samaria is 
Remaliah’s son. 

If ye will not have faith, surely ye 
shall not be established.’ 

 

10And the LORD spoke again unto 
Ahaz, saying: 11’Ask thee a sign of the 
LORD thy God: ask it either in the 
depth, or in the height above.’ 12But 
Ahaz said: ‘I will not ask, neither will 
I try the LORD.’ 13And he said: ‘Hear ye 
now, O house of David: Is it a small 
thing for you to weary men, that ye 
will weary my God also? 14Therefore 
the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: 
behold, the young woman shall 
conceive, and bear a son, and shall call 
his name bImmanuel. 15Curd and 
honey shall he eat, when he knoweth 
to refuse the evil, and choose the good. 
16Yea, before the child shall know to 
refuse the evil, and choose the good, 
the land whose two kings thou hast a 
horror of shall be forsaken. 17The LORD 
shall bring upon thee, and upon thy 
people, and upon thy father’s house, 
days that have not come, from the day 
that Ephraim departed from Judah; 
even the king of Assyria.’ 

b That is, God is with us. 

18And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 


That the LORD shall hiss for the fly 

That is in the uttermost part of the 
rivers of Egypt, 

And for the bee that is in the land of 

Assyria. 

19And they shall come, and shall rest 
all of them 

In the rugged valleys, and in the 
holes of the rocks, 

And upon all thorns, and upon all 
brambles. 

20In that day shall the Lord shave 
with a razor that is hired in the parts 
beyond the River, even with the king 
of Assyria, the head and the hair of the 
feet; and it shall also sweep away the 
beard. 

21And it shall come to pass in that 
day, that a man shall rear a young cow, 
and two sheep; 22and it shall come to 
pass, for the abundance of milk that 
they shall give, he shall eat curd; for 
curd and honey shall every one eat that 
is left in the midst of the land. 

23And it shall come to pass in that 
day, that every place, where there were 
a thousand vines at a thousand 
silverlings, shall even be for briers and 
thorns. 24With arrows and with bow 
shall one come thither; because all the 
land shall become briers and thorns. 
25And all the hills that were digged 
with the mattock, thou shalt not come 
thither for fear of briers and thorns, but 
it shall be for the sending forth of 
oxen, and for the treading of sheep. 

 

8 



And the LORD said unto me: ‘Take 
thee a great tablet, and write upon 
it in common script: The spoil 
speedeth, the prey hasteth; 2and I will 
take unto Me faithful witnesses to 
record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah 
the son of Jeberechiah.’ 3And I went 
unto the prophetess; and she 
conceived, and bore a son. Then said 
the LORD unto me: ‘Call his name 
aMaher-shalal-hashbaz. 4For before the 
child shall have knowledge to cry: My 
father, and: My mother, the riches of 
Damascus and the spoil of Samaria 
shall be carried away before the king 
of Assyria.’ 

a That is, The spoil speedeth, the 
prey hasteth. 

5And the LORD spoke unto me yet 
again, saying: 

6Forasmuch as this people hath 
refused 

The waters of Shiloah that go softly, 

And rejoiceth with Rezin and 
Remaliah’s son; 

7Now therefore, behold, the Lord 
bringeth up upon them 

The waters of the River, mighty and 
many, 

Even the king of Assyria and all his 
glory; 

And he shall come up over all his 

 channels, 

And go over all his banks; 

8And he shall sweep through Judah 

Overflowing as he passeth through 

He shall reach even to the neck; 

And the stretching out of his wings 

Shall fill the breadth of thy land, O 
Immanuel. 


 

9Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and 
ye shall be broken in pieces; 

And give ear, all ye of far countries; 

Gird yourselves, and ye shall be 
broken in pieces; 

Gird yourselves, and ye shall be 
broken in pieces. 

10Take counsel together, and it shall 
be brought to nought; 

Speak the word, and it shall not 
stand; 

For God is with us. 

11For the LORD spoke thus to me 
with a strong hand, admonishing me 
that I should not walk in the way of 
this people, saying: 12’Say ye not: A 
conspiracy, concerning all whereof 
this people do say: A conspiracy; 
neither fear ye their fear, nor account it 
dreadful. 13The LORD of hosts, Him 
shall ye sanctify; and let Him be your 
fear, and let Him be your dread. 14And 
He shall be for a sanctuary; but for a 
stone of stumbling and for a rock of 
offence to both the houses of Israel, 
for a gin and for a snare to the 
inhabitants of Jerusalem. 15And many 
among them shall stumble, and fall, 
and be broken, and be snared, and be 
taken.’ 

16’Bind up the testimony, seal the 
instruction among My disciples.’ 
17And I will wait for the LORD, that 
hideth His face from the house of 
Jacob, and I will look for Him. 
18Behold, I and the children whom the 
LORD hath given me shall be for signs 
and for wonders in Israel from the 
LORD of hosts, who dwelleth in mount 
Zion. 19And when they shall say unto 
you: ‘Seek unto the ghosts and the 
familiar spirits, that chirp and that 
mutter; should not a people seek unto 
their God? on behalf of the living unto 
the dead 20for instruction and for 
testimony?’—Surely they will speak 
according to this word, wherein there 
is no light.— 21And they shall pass this 
way that are sore bestead and hungry; 
and it shall come to pass that, when 
they shall be hungry, they shall fret 
themselves, and curse by their king 
and by their God, and, whether they 
turn their faces upward, 22or look unto 
the earth, behold distress and darkness, 
the gloom of anguish, and outspread 
thick darkness. 23For is there no gloom 
to her that was stedfast? Now the 
former hath lightly afflicted the land of 
Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but 
the latter hath dealt a more grievous 
blow by the way of the sea, beyond the 
Jordan, in the district of the nations. 

 

The people that walked in 
darkness Have seen a great light; 

They that dwelt in the land of the 
shadow of death, 

Upon them hath the light shined. 

2Thou hast multiplied the nation, 

Thou hast increased their joy; 

They joy before Thee according to 
the joy in harvest, 

As men rejoice when they divide the 
spoil. 

3For the yoke of his burden, 

And the staff of his shoulder, 
9 




The rod of his oppressor, 

Thou hast broken as in the day of 
Midian. 

4For every boot stamped with 
fierceness, 

And every cloak rolled in blood, 

Shall even be for burning, for fuel of 
fire. 

5For a child is born unto us, 

A son is given unto us; 

And the government is upon his 
shoulder; 

And his name is called 

aPele-joez-el-gibbor- 

a That is, Wonderful in counsel is 
God, the Mighty, the Everlasting 
Father, the Ruler of peace. 

Abi-ad-sar-shalom; 

6That the government may be 
increased, And of peace there be 
no end, 

Upon the throne of David, and upon 
his kingdom, 

To establish it, and to uphold it 

Through justice and through 
righteousness From henceforth 
even for ever. 

The zeal of the LORD of hosts doth 
perform this. 

 

7The Lord sent a word into Jacob, 

And it hath lighted upon Israel. 

8And all the people shall know, 

Even Ephraim and the inhabitant of 
Samaria, 

That say in pride and in arrogancy 
of heart: 

9‘The bricks are fallen, but we will 
build with hewn stones; 

The sycamores are cut down, but 
cedars will we put in their place.’ 

10Therefore the LORD doth set upon 
high the adversaries of Rezin 
against him, 

And spur his enemies; 

11The Arameans on the east, and the 
Philistines on the west; 

And they devour Israel with open 
mouth. 

For all this His anger is not turned 
away, 

But His hand is stretched out still. 

 

12Yet the people turneth not unto 
Him that smiteth them, 

Neither do they seek the LORD of 
hosts. 

13Therefore the LORD doth cut off 
from Israel head and tail, 

Palm-branch and rush, in one day. 

14The elder and the man of rank, he 
is the head; 

And the prophet that teacheth lies, 
he is the tail. 

15For they that lead this people 
cause them to err; 

And they that are led of them are 
destroyed. 

16Therefore the Lord shall have no 
joy in their young men, 

Neither shall He have compassion 
on their fatherless and widows; 

For every one is ungodly and an 
evil-doer, 

And every mouth speaketh 
wantonness. 


For all this His anger is not turned 
away, 

But His hand is stretched out still. 

 

17 For wickedness burneth as the 
fire; 

It devoureth the briers and thorns; 

Yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the 
forest, 

And they roll upward in thick clouds 
of smoke. 

18Through the wrath of the LORD of 
hosts is the land burnt up; 

The people also are as the fuel of 
fire; 

No man spareth his brother. 

19And one snatcheth on the right 
hand, and is hungry; 

And he eateth on the left hand, and 
is not satisfied; 

They eat every man the flesh of his 
own arm: 

20Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, 
Manasseh; 

And they together are against Judah. 

For all this His anger is not turned 
away, 

But His hand is stretched out still. 

 

Woe unto them that decree 
unrighteous decrees, 

And to the writers that write 
iniquity; 

2To turn aside the needy from 
judgment, 

And to take away the right of the 
poor of My people, 

That widows may be their spoil, 

And that they may make the 
fatherless their prey! 

3And what will ye do in the day of 
visitation, 

And in the ruin which shall come 
from far? 

To whom will ye flee for help? 

And where will ye leave your glory? 

4They can do nought except crouch 
under the captives, 

And fall under the slain. 

For all this His anger is not turned 
away, 

But His hand is stretched out still. 

 

5O Asshur, the rod of Mine anger, 

In whose hand as a staff is Mine 
indignation! 

6I do send him against an ungodly 
nation, And against the people of My 
wrath do I give him a charge, 

To take the spoil, and to take the 
prey, 

And to tread them down like the 
mire of the streets. 

7Howbeit he meaneth not so, 

Neither doth his heart think so; 

But it is in his heart to destroy, 

And to cut off nations not a few. 

8For he saith: ‘Are not my princes 
all of them kings? 

9Is not Calno as Carchemish? 

Is not Hamath as Arpad? 

Is not Samaria as Damascus? 

10As my hand hath reached the 
kingdoms of the idols, 

Whose graven images did exceed 
them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; 

11Shall I not, as I have done unto 
10 




Samaria and her idols, 

So do to Jerusalem and her idols?’ 
12Wherefore it shall come to pass, that 
when the Lord hath performed His 
whole work upon mount Zion and on 
Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the 
arrogant heart of the king of Assyria, 
and the glory of his haughty looks. 
13For he hath said: 

By the strength of my hand I have 
done it, 

And by my wisdom, for I am 
prudent; 

In that I have removed the bounds 
of the peoples, 

And have robbed their treasures, 

And have brought down as one 
mighty the inhabitants; 

14And my hand hath found as a nest 
the riches of the peoples; 

And as one gathereth eggs that are 
forsaken, 

Have I gathered all the earth; 

And there was none that moved the 
wing, Or that opened mouth, or 
chirped. 

 

15Should the axe boast itself against 
him that heweth therewith? 

Should the saw magnify itself 
against him that moveth it? 

As if a rod should move them that 
lift it up, 

Or as if a staff should lift up him 
that is not wood. 

16Therefore will the Lord, the LORD 
of hosts, 

Send among his fat ones leanness; 

And under his glory there shall be 
kindled 

A burning like the burning of fire. 

17And the light of Israel shall be for 
a fire, 

And his Holy One for a flame; 

And it shall burn and devour his 
thorns 

And his briers in one day. 

18And the glory of his forest and of 
his fruitful field, 

He will consume both soul and 
body; 

And it shall be as when a sick man 
wasteth away. 

19And the remnant of the trees of his 
forest shall be few, 

That a child may write them down. 

 

20And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 

That the remnant of Israel, 

And they that are escaped of the 
house of Jacob, 

Shall no more again stay upon him 
that smote them; 

But shall stay upon the LORD, the 
Holy One of Israel, in truth. 

21 aA remnant shall return, even the 
remnant of Jacob, 

a Heb. shear jashub. 

Unto God the Mighty. 

22For though thy people, O Israel, be 
as the sand of the sea, 

Only a remnant of them shall return; 

An extermination is determined, 
overflowing with righteousness. 


23For an extermination wholly 
determined 

Shall the Lord, the GOD of hosts, 
make in the midst of all the earth. 

 

24Therefore thus saith the Lord, the 
GOD of hosts: O My people that 
dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of 
Asshur, though he smite thee with the 
rod, and lift up his staff against thee, 
after the manner of Egypt. 25For yet a 
very little while, and the indignation 
shall be accomplished, and Mine anger 
shall be to their destruction. 26And the 
LORD of hosts shall stir up against him 
a scourge, as in the slaughter of 
Midian at the Rock of Oreb; and as 
His rod was over the sea, so shall He 
lift it up after the manner of Egypt. 
27And it shall come to pass in that day, 
that 

His burden shall depart from off thy 
shoulder, 

And his yoke from off thy neck, 

And the yoke shall be destroyed by 
reason of fatness. 

28He is come to Aiath, 

He is passed through Migron; 

At Michmas he layeth up his 
baggage; 

29They are gone over the pass; 

They have taken up their lodging at 
Geba; Ramah trembleth; 

Gibeath-shaul is fled. 

30Cry thou with a shrill voice, O 
daughter of Gallim! 

Hearken, O Laish! O thou poor 
Anathoth! 

31Madmenah is in mad flight; 

The inhabitants of Gebim flee to 
cover. 

32This very day shall he halt at Nob, 

Shaking his hand at the mount of the 
daughter of Zion, 

The hill of Jerusalem. 

 

33Behold, the Lord, the LORD of 
hosts, 

Shall lop the boughs with terror; 

And the high ones of stature shall be 
hewn down, 

And the lofty shall be laid low. 

34And He shall cut down the 
thickets of the forest with iron, 

And Lebanon shall fall by a mighty 
one. 

 

And there shall come forth a 
shoot out of the stock of 
Jesse, 

And a twig shall grow forth out of 
his roots. 

2And the spirit of the LORD shall rest 
upon him, 

The spirit of wisdom and 
understanding, 

The spirit of counsel and might, 

The spirit of knowledge and of the 
fear of the LORD. 

3And his delight shall be in the fear 
of the LORD; 

And he shall not judge after the 
sight of his eyes, 

Neither decide after the hearing of 
his ears; 

4But with righteousness shall he 
judge the poor, 
11 




And decide with equity for the meek 
of the land; 

And he shall smite the land with the 
rod of his mouth, 

And with the breath of his lips shall 
he slay the wicked. 

5And righteousness shall be the 
girdle of his loins, 

And faithfulness the girdle of his 
reins. 

6And the wolf shall dwell with the 
lamb, 

And the leopard shall lie down with 
the kid; 

And the calf and the young lion and 
the fatling together; 

And a little child shall lead them. 

7And the cow and the bear feed; 

Their young ones shall lie down 
together; 

And the lion shall eat straw like the 
ox. 

8And the sucking child shall play on 
the hole of the asp, 

And the weaned child shall put his 
hand on the basilisk’s den. 

9They shall not hurt nor destroy 

In all My holy mountain; 

For the earth shall be full of the 
knowledge of the LORD, 

As the waters cover the sea. 

 

10And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 

That the root of Jesse, that standeth 
for an ensign of the peoples, 

Unto him shall the nations seek; 

And his resting-place shall be 
glorious. 

 

11And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 

That the Lord will set His hand 
again the second time 

To recover the remnant of His 
people, 

That shall remain from Assyria, and 
from Egypt, 

And from Pathros, and from Cush, 
and from Elam, 

And from Shinar, and from Hamath, 
and from the islands of the sea. 

12And He will set up an ensign for 
the nations, 

And will assemble the dispersed of 
Israel, 

And gather together the scattered of 
Judah 

From the four corners of the earth. 

13The envy also of Ephraim shall 
depart, 

And they that harass Judah shall be 
cut off; 

Ephraim shall not envy Judah, 

And Judah shall not vex Ephraim. 

14And they shall fly down upon the 
shoulder of the Philistines on the 
west; 

Together shall they spoil the 
children of the east; 

They shall put forth their hand upon 
Edom and Moab; 

And the children of Ammon shall 
obey them. 

15And the LORD will utterly destroy 
the tongue of the Egyptian sea; 


And with His scorching wind will 
He shake His hand over the 
River, 

And will smite it into seven streams, 

And cause men to march over dry-
shod. 

16And there shall be a highway for 
the remnant of His people, 

That shall remain from Assyria, 

Like as there was for Israel 

In the day that he came up out of the 
land of Egypt. 

 

And in that day thou shalt say: 

‘I will give thanks unto Thee, 
O LORD; 

For though Thou was angry with 
me, 

Thine anger is turned away, and 
Thou comfortest me. 

2Behold, God is my salvation; 

I will trust, and will not be afraid; 

For GOD the LORD is my strength and 
song; 

And He is become my salvation.’ 

3Therefore with joy shall ye draw 
water 

Out of the wells of salvation. 

4And in that day shall ye say: 

‘Give thanks unto the LORD, 
proclaim His name, 

Declare His doings among the 
peoples, 

Make mention that His name is 
exalted. 

5Sing unto the LORD; for He hath 
done gloriously; 

This is made known in all the earth. 

6Cry aloud and shout, thou 
inhabitant of Zion, 

For great is the Holy One of Israel 
in the midst of thee.’ 

 

The burden of Babylon, which 
Isaiah the son of Amoz did 
see. 

 

2Set ye up an ensign upon the high 
mountain, 

Lift up the voice unto them, 

Wave the hand, that they may go 

Into the gates of the nobles. 

3I have commanded My consecrated 
ones, 

Yea, I have called My mighty ones 
for mine anger, 

Even My proudly exulting ones. 

4Hark, a tumult in the mountains, 

Like as of a great people! 

Hark, the uproar of the kingdoms 

Of the nations gathered together! 

The LORD of hosts mustereth 

The host of the battle. 

 

5They come from a far country, 

From the end of heaven, 

Even the LORD, and the weapons of 
His indignation, 

To destroy the whole earth. 

6Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is 
at hand; 

As destruction from the Almighty 
shall it come. 

7Therefore shall all hands be slack, 

And every heart of man shall melt. 

8And they shall be affrighted; 
12 

13 




Pangs and throes shall take hold of 
them; 

They shall be in pain as a woman in 
travail; 

They shall look aghast one at 
another; 

Their faces shall be faces of flame. 

 

9Behold, the day of the LORD 
cometh, 

Cruel, and full of wrath and fierce 
anger; 

To make the earth a desolation, 

And to destroy the sinners thereof 
out of it, 

10For the stars of heaven and the 
constellations thereof 

Shall not give their light; 

The sun shall be darkened in his 
going forth, 

And the moon shall not cause her 
light to shine. 

11And I will visit upon the world 
their evil, 

And upon the wicked their iniquity; 

And I will cause the arrogancy of 
the proud to cease, 

And will lay low the haughtiness of 
the tyrants. 

12I will make man more rare than 
fine gold, 

Even man than the pure gold of 
Ophir. 

 

13Therefore I will make the heavens 
to tremble, 

And the earth shall be shaken out of 
her place, 

For the wrath of the LORD of hosts, 

And for the day of His fierce anger. 

14And it shall come to pass, that as 
the chased gazelle, 

And as sheep that no man gathereth, 

They shall turn every man to his 
own people, 

And shall flee every man to his own 
land. 

15Every one that is found shall be 
thrust through; 

And every one that is caught shall 
fall by the sword. 

16Their babes also shall be dashed in 
pieces before their eyes; 

Their houses shall be spoiled, 

And their wives ravished. 

 

17Behold, I will stir up the Medes 
against them, 

Who shall not regard silver, 

And as for gold, they shall not 
delight in it. 

18And their bows shall dash the 
young men in pieces; 

And they shall have no pity on the 
fruit of the womb; 

Their eye shall not spare children. 

19And Babylon, the glory of 
kingdoms, 

The beauty of the Chaldeans’pride, 

Shall be as when God overthrew 
Sodom and Gomorrah. 

 

20It shall never be inhabited, 

Neither shall it be dwelt in from 
generation to generation; 

Neither shall the Arabian pitch tent 
there; 


Neither shall the shepherds make 
their fold there. 

21But wild-cats shall lie there; 

And their houses shall be full of 
ferrets; 

And ostriches shall dwell there, 

And satyrs shall dance there. 

22And jackals shall howl in their 
castles, 

And wild-dogs in the pleasant 
palaces; 

And her time is near to come, 

And her days shall not be 
prolonged. 

 

For the LORD will have 
compassion on Jacob, and will 
yet choose Israel, and set them in their 
own land; and the stranger shall join 
himself with them, and they shall 
cleave to the house of Jacob. 2And the 
peoples shall take them, and bring 
them to their place; and the house of 
Israel shall possess them in the land of 
the LORD for servants and for 
handmaids; and they shall take them 
captive, whose captives they were; and 
they shall rule over their oppressors. 

3And it shall come to pass in the day 
that the LORD shall give thee rest from 
thy travail, and from thy trouble, and 
from the hard service wherein thou 
wast made to serve, 4that thou shalt 
take up this parable against the king of 
Babylon, and say: 

How hath the oppressor ceased! 

The exactress of gold ceased! 

5The LORD hath broken the staff of 
the wicked, 

The sceptre of the rulers, 

6That smote the peoples in wrath 

With an incessant stroke, 

That ruled the nations in anger, 

With a persecution that none 
restrained. 

7The whole earth is at rest, and is 
quiet; 

They break forth into singing. 

8Yea, the cypresses rejoice at thee, 

And the cedars of Lebanon: 

‘Since thou art laid down, 

No feller is come up against us.’ 

 

9The nether-world from beneath is 
moved for thee 

To meet thee at thy coming; 

The shades are stirred up for thee, 

Even all the chief ones of the earth; 

All the kings of the nations 

Are raised up from their thrones. 

10All they do answer 

And say unto thee: 

‘Art thou also become weak as we? 

Art thou become like unto us? 

11Thy pomp is brought down to the 
nether-world, 

And the noise of thy psalteries; 

The maggot is spread under thee, 

And the worms cover thee.’ 

 

12How art thou fallen from heaven, 

O day-star, son of the morning! 

How art thou cut down to the 
ground, 

That didst cast lots over the nations! 

13And thou saidst in thy heart: 

‘I will ascend into heaven, 

Above the stars of God 
14 




Will I exalt my throne, 

And I will sit upon the mount of 
meeting, 

In the uttermost parts of the north; 

14I will ascend above the heights of 
the clouds; 

I will be like the Most High.’ 

15Yet thou shalt be brought down to 
the nether-world, 

To the uttermost parts of the pit. 

 

16They that saw thee do narrowly 
look upon thee, 

They gaze earnestly at thee: 

‘Is this the man that made the earth 
to tremble, 

That did shake kingdoms; 

17That made the world as a 
wilderness, 

And destroyed the cities thereof; 

That opened not the house of his 
prisoners?’ 

18All the kings of the nations, 

All of them, sleep in glory, 

Every one in his own house. 

19But thou art cast forth away from 
thy grave 

Like an abhorred offshoot, 

In the raiment of the slain, that are 
thrust through with the sword, 

That go down to the pavement of 
the pit, 

As a carcass trodden under foot. 

20Thou shalt not be joined with them 
in burial, 

Bbecause thou hast destroyed thy 
land, 

Thou hast slain thy people; 

The seed of evil-doers shall not 

Be named for ever. 

21Prepare ye slaughter for his 
children 

For the iniquity of their fathers; 

That they rise not up, and possess 
the earth, 

And fill the face of the world with 
cities. 

22And I will rise up against them, 
saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off 
from Babylon name and remnant, and 
offshoot and offspring, saith the LORD. 
23I will also make it a possession for 
the bittern, and pools of water; and I 
will sweep it with the besom of 
destruction, saith the LORD of hosts. 

 

24The LORD of hosts hath sworn, 
saying: 

Surely as I have thought, so shall it 
come to pass; 

And as I have purposed, so shall it 
stand, 

25That I will break Asshur in My 
land, 

And upon My mountains tread him 
under foot; 

Then shall his yoke depart from off 
them, 

And his burden depart from off their 
shoulder. 

26This is the purpose that is 
purposed upon the whole earth; 

And this is the hand that is stretched 
out upon all the nations. 

27For the LORD of hosts hath 
purposed, 

And who shall disannul it? 

And His hand is stretched out, 


And who shall turn it back? 

 

28In the year that king Ahaz died 
was this burden. 

 

29Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee, 

Because the rod that smote thee is 
broken: 

For out of the serpent’s root shall 
come forth a basilisk, 

And his fruit shall be a flying 
serpent. 

30And the first-born of the poor shall 
feed, 

And the needy shall lie down in 
safety; 

And I will kill thy root with famine, 

And thy remnant shall be slain 

31Howl, O gate; cry, O city; 

Melt away, O Philistia, all of thee; 

For there cometh a smoke out of the 
north, 

And there is no straggler in his 
ranks. 

32What then shall one answer the 
messengers of the nation? 

That the LORD hath founded Zion, 

And in her shall the afflicted of His 
people take refuge. 

 

The burden of Moab. 

 

For in the night that Ar of Moab is 
laid waste, 

He is brought to ruin; 

For in the night that Kir of Moab is 
laid waste, 

He is brought to ruin. 

2He is gone up to Baith, and to 
Dibon, 

Tto the high places, to weep; 

Upon Nebo, and upon Medeba, 
Moab howleth; 

On all their heads is baldness, 

Every beard is shaven. 

3In their streets they gird themselves 
with sackcloth; 

On their housetops, and in their 
broad places, 

Every one howleth, weeping 
profusely. 

4And Heshbon crieth out, and 
Elealeh; 

Their voice is heard even unto 
Jahaz; 

Therefore the armed men of Moab 
cry aloud; 

His soul is faint within him. 

5My heart crieth out for Moab; 

Her fugitives reach unto Zoar, 

A heifer of three years old; 

For by the ascent of Luhith 

With weeping they go up; 

For in the way of Horonaim 

They raise up a cry of destruction. 

6For the Waters of Nimrim shall be 
desolate; 

For the grass is withered away, the 
herbage faileth, 

There is no green thing. 

7Therefore the abundance they have 
gotten, 

And that which they have laid up, 

Shall they carry away to the brook 
of the willows. 

8For the cry is gone round about 

The borders of Moab; 
15 




The howling thereof unto Eglaim, 

And the howling thereof unto Beer-
elim. 

9For the waters of Dimon are full of 
blood; 

For I will bring yet more upon 
Dimon, 

A lion upon him that escapeth of 
Moab, 

And upon the remnant of the land. 

 

Send ye the lambs for the ruler 
of the land 

From the crags that are toward the 
wilderness, 

Unto the mount of the daughter of 
Zion. 

2For it shall be that, as wandering 
birds, 

As a scattered nest, 

So shall the daughters of Moab be 

At the fords of Arnon. 

3’Give counsel, execute justice; 

Make thy shadow as the night in the 
midst of the noonday; 

Hide the outcasts; betray not the 
fugitive. 

4Let mine outcasts dwell with thee; 

As for Moab, be thou a covert to 
him from the face of the spoiler.’ 

For the extortion is at an end, 
spoiling ceaseth, 

They that trampled down are 
consumed out of the land; 

5And a throne is established through 
mercy, 

And there sitteth thereon in truth, in 
the tent of David, 

One that judgeth, and seeketh 
justice, and is ready in 
righteousness. 

 

6We have heard of the pride of 
Moab; 

He is very proud; 

Even of his haughtiness, and his 
pride, and his arrogancy, 

His ill-founded boastings. 

7Therefore shall Moab wail for 
Moab, 

Every one shall wail; for the sweet 
cakes of Kir-hareseth shall ye 
mourn, 

Sorely stricken. 

8For the fields of Heshbon languish, 

And the vine of Sibmah, 

Whose choice plants did overcome 

The lords of nations; 

They reached even unto Jazer, 

They wandered into the wilderness; 

Her branches were spread abroad, 

They passed over the sea. 

9Therefore I will weep with the 
weeping of Jazer 

For the vine of Sibmah; 

I will water thee with my tears, 

O Heshbon, and Elealeh; 

For upon thy summer fruits and 
upon thy harvest 

The battle shout is fallen. 

10And gladness and joy are taken 
away 

Out of the fruitful field; 

And in the vineyards there shall be 
no singing, 

Neither shall there be shouting; 
16 




No treader shall tread out wine in 
the presses; 

I have made the vintage shout to 
cease. 

11Wherefore my heart moaneth like 
a harp for Moab, 

And mine inward parts for Kir-
heres. 

12And it shall come to pass, when it 
is seen that Moab hath wearied himself 
upon the high place, that he shall come 
to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall 
not prevail 

13This is the word that the LORD 
spoke concerning Moab in time past. 
14But now the LORD hath spoken, 
saying: ‘Within three years, as the 
years of a hireling, and the glory of 
Moab shall wax contemptible for all 
his great multitude; and the remnant 
shall be very small and without 
strength.’ 

 

The burden of Damascus. 

 

Behold, Damascus is taken away 
from being a city, 

And it shall be a ruinous heap. 

2The cities of Aroer are forsaken; 

They shall be for flocks, 

Which shall lie down, and none 
shall make them afraid. 

3The fortress also shall cease from 
Ephraim, 

And the kingdom from Damascus; 

And the remnant of Aram shall be 
as the glory of the children of 
Israel, 

Sith the LORD of hosts. 

 

4And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 

That the glory of Jacob shall be 
made thin, 

And the fatness of his flesh shall 
wax lean. 

5And it shall be as when the 
harvestman gathereth the standing 
corn, 

And reapeth the ears with his arm; 

Yea, it shall be as when one 
gleaneth ears 

In the valley of Rephaim. 

6Yet there shall be left therein 
gleanings, 

As at the beating of an olive-tree, 

Two or three berries 

In the top of the uppermost bough, 

Four or five in the branches of the 
fruitful tree, 

Saith the LORD, the God of Israel. 

 

7In that day shall a man regard his 
Maker, 

And his eyes shall look to the Holy 
One of Israel. 

8And he shall not regard the altars, 

The work of his hands, 

Neither shall he look to that which 
his fingers have made, 

Either the Asherim, or the sun-
images. 

 

9In that day shall his strong cities be 
as the forsaken places, which were 
forsaken from before the children of 
Israel, after the manner of woods and 
17 




lofty forests; and it shall be a 
desolation. 

10For thou hast forgotten the God of 
thy salvation, 

And thou hast not been mindful of 
the Rock of thy stronghold; 

Therefore thou didst plant plants of 
pleasantness, 

And didst set it with slips of a 
stranger; 

11In the day of thy planting thou 
didst make it to grow, 

And in the morning thou didst make 
thy seed to blossom— 

A heap of boughs in the day of grief 

And of desperate pain. 

 

12Ah, the uproar of many peoples, 

That roar like the roaring of the 
seas; 

And the rushing of nations, that rush 
like the rushing of mighty waters! 

13The nations shall rush like the 
rushing of many waters; 

But He shall rebuke them, and they 
shall flee far off, 

And shall be chased as the chaff of 
the mountains before the wind, 

And like the whirling dust before 
the storm. 

14At eventide behold terror; 

And before the morning they are 
not. 

This is the portion of them that spoil 
us, 

And the lot of them that rob us. 

 

Ah, land of the buzzing of 
wings, 

Which is beyond the rivers of 
Ethiopia; 

2That sendeth ambassadors by the 
sea, 

Even in vessels of papyrus upon the 
waters! 

Go, ye swift messengers, 

To a nation tall and of glossy skin, 

To a people terrible from their 
beginning onward; 

A nation that is sturdy and treadeth 
down, 

Whose land the rivers divide! 

3All ye inhabitants of the world, and 
ye dwellers on the earth, 

When an ensign is lifted up on the 
mountains, see ye; 

And when the horn is blown, hear 
ye. 

 

4For thus hath the LORD said unto 
me: 

I will hold Me still, and I will look 
on in My dwelling-place, 

Like clear heat in sunshine, 

Like a cloud of dew in the heat of 
harvest. 

5For before the harvest, when the 
blossom is over, 

And the bud becometh a ripening 
grape, 

He will cut off the sprigs with 
pruning-hooks, 

And the shoots will He take away 
and lop off. 

6They shall be left together unto the 
ravenous birds of the mountains, 

And to the beasts of the earth; 18 




And the ravenous birds shall 
summer upon them, 

And all the beasts of the earth shall 
winter upon them. 

7In that time shall a present be 
brought unto the LORD of hosts of 
a people tall and of glossy skin, 
and from a people terrible from 
their beginning onward; a nation 
that is sturdy and treadeth down, 
whose land the rivers divide, to 
the place of the name of the LORD 
of hosts, the mount Zion. 

 

The burden of Egypt. 

 

Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift 
cloud, 

And cometh unto Egypt; 

And the idols of Egypt shall be 
moved at His presence, 

And the heart of Egypt shall melt 
within it. 

2And I will spur Egypt against 
Egypt; 

And they shall fight every one 
against his brother, 

And everyone against his neighbour; 

City against city, and kingdom 
against kingdom. 

3And the spirit of Egypt shall be 
made empty within it; 

And I will make void the counsel 
thereof; 

And they shall seek unto the idols, 
and to the whisperers, 

And to the ghosts, and to the 
familiar spirits. 

4And I will give over the Egyptians 

Iinto the hand of a cruel lord; 

And a fierce king shall rule over 
them, 

Saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts. 

 

5And the waters shall fail from the 
sea, 

And the river shall be drained dry, 

6And the rivers shall become foul; 

The streams of Egypt shall be 
minished and dried up; 

The reeds and flags shall wither. 

7The mosses by the Nile, by the 
brink of the Nile, 

And all that is sown by the Nile, 

Shall become dry, be driven away, 
and be no more. 

8The fishers also shall lament, 

And all they that cast angle into the 
Nile shall mourn, 

And they that spread nets upon the 
waters shall languish. 

9Moreover they that work in 
combed flax, 

And they that weave cotton, shall 
be ashamed. 

10And her foundations shall be 
crushed, 

All they that make dams shall be 
grieved in soul. 

 

11The princes of Zoan are utter 
fools; 

The wisest counsellors of Pharaoh 
are a senseless counsel; 

How can ye say unto Pharaoh: ‘I 
am the son of the wise, 

The son of ancient kings’? 
19 




12Where are they, then, thy wise 
men? 

And let them tell thee now; 

And let them know what the LORD 
of hosts 

Hath purposed concerning Egypt. 

13The princes of Zoan are become 
fools, 

The princes of Noph are deceived; 

They have caused Egypt to go 
astray, 

That are the corner-stone of her 
tribes. 

14The LORD hath mingled within 
her 

A spirit of dizziness; 

And they have caused Egypt to 
stagger in every work thereof, 

As a drunken man staggereth in his 
vomit. 

15Neither shall there be for Egypt 
any work, 

Which head or tail, palm-branch or 
rush, may do. 

16In that day shall Egypt be like unto 
women; and it shall tremble and fear 
because of the shaking of the hand of 
the LORD of hosts, which He shaketh 
over it. 17And the land of Judah shall 
become a terror unto Egypt, 
whensoever one maketh mention 
thereof to it; it shall be afraid, because 
of the purpose of the LORD of hosts, 
which He purposeth against it. 

18In that day there shall be five cities 
in the land of Egypt that speak the 
language of Canaan, and swear to the 
LORD of hosts; one shall be called The 
city of destruction. 19In that day shall 
there be an altar to the LORD in the 
midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar 
at the border thereof to the LORD. 
20And it shall be for a sign and for a 
witness unto the LORD of hosts in the 
land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto 
the LORD because of the oppressors, 
and He will send them a saviour, and a 
defender, who will deliver them. 21And 
the LORD shall make Himself known to 
Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know 
the LORD in that day; yea, they shall 
worship with sacrifice and offering, 
and shall vow a vow unto the LORD, 
and shall perform it. 

22And the LORD will smite Egypt, 
smiting and healing; and they shall 
return unto the LORD, and He will be 
entreated of them, and will heal them. 
23In that day shall there be a highway 
out of Egypt to Assyria, and the 
Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and 
the Egyptian into Assyria; and the 
Egyptians shall worship with the 
Assyrians. 

24In that day shall Israel be the third 
with Egypt and with Assyria, a 
blessing in the midst of the earth; 25for 
that the LORD of hosts hath blessed 
him, saying: ‘Blessed be Egypt My 
people and Assyria the work of My 
hands, and Israel Mine inheritance.’ 

 

In the year that Tartan came 
into Ashdod, when Sargon the 
king of Assyria sent him, and he 
fought against Ashdod and took it; 2at 
that time the LORD spoke by Isaiah the 
son of Amoz, saying: ‘Go, and loose 
20 




the sackcloth from off thy loins, and 
put thy shoe from off thy foot.’ And he 
did so, walking naked and barefoot. 

3And the LORD said: ‘Like as My 
servant Isaiah hath walked naked and 
barefoot to be for three years a sign 
and a wonder upon Egypt and upon 
Ethiopia, 4so shall the king of Assyria 
lead away the captives of Egypt, and 
the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, 
naked and barefoot, and with buttocks 
uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
5And they shall be dismayed and 
ashamed, because of Ethiopia their 
expectation, and of Egypt their glory. 
6And the inhabitant of this coast-land 
shall say in that day: Behold, such is 
our expectation, whither we fled for 
help to be delivered from the king of 
Assyria; and how shall we escape?’ 

 

The burden of the wilderness 
of the sea. 

 

As whirlwinds in the South 
sweeping on, 

It cometh from the wilderness, from 
a dreadful land. 

2A grievous vision is declared unto 
me: 

‘The treacherous dealer dealeth 
treacherously, and the spoiler 
spoileth. 

Go up, O Elam! besiege, O Media! 

All the sighing thereof have I made 
to cease.’ 

3Therefore are my loins filled with 
convulsion; 

Pangs have taken hold upon me, as 
the pangs of a woman in travail; 

I am bent so that I cannot hear; 

I am affrighted so that I cannot see. 

4My heart is bewildered, terror hath 
overwhelmed me; 

The twilight that I longed for hath 
been turned for me into 
trembling. 

5They prepare the table, they light 
the lamps, they eat, they drink— 

’Rise up, ye princes, anoint the 
shield.’ 

 

6For thus hath the Lord said unto 
me: 

Go, set a watchman; let him declare 
what he seeth! 

7And when he seeth a troop, 
horsemen by pairs, 

A troop of asses, a troop of camels, 

He shall hearken diligently with 
much heed. 

8And he cried as a lion: ‘Upon the 
watch-tower, O Lord, 

I stand continually in the daytime, 

And I am set in my ward all the 
nights.’ 

9And, behold, there came a troop of 
men, horsemen by pairs. 

And he spoke and said: 

‘Fallen, fallen is Babylon; 

And all the graven images of her 
gods are broken unto the ground.’ 

10O thou my threshing, and the 
winnowing of my floor, 

That which I have heard from the 
LORD of hosts, 
21 




The God of Israel, have I declared 
unto you. 

 

11The burden of Dumah. 

 

One calleth unto me out of Seir: 

‘Watchman, what of the night? 

Watchman, what of the night?’ 

12The watchman said: 

‘The morning cometh, and also the 
night— 

If ye will inquire, inquire ye; return, 
come.’ 

 

13The burden upon Arabia. 

 

In the thickets in Arabia shall ye 
lodge, O ye caravans of 
Dedanites. 

14Unto him that is thirsty bring ye 
water! 

The inhabitants of the land of Tema 
did meet the fugitive with his 
bread. 

15For they fled away from the 
swords, from the drawn sword, 

And from the bent bow, and from 
the grievousness of war. 

16For thus hath the Lord said unto me: 
‘Within a year, according to the years 
of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar 
shall fail; 17and the residue of the 
number of the archers, the mighty men 
of the children of Kedar, shall be 
diminished; for the LORD, the God of 
Israel, hath spoken it.’ 

 

The burden concerning the 
Valley of Vision. 

 

What aileth thee now, that thou art 
wholly gone up to the housetops, 

2Thou that art full of uproar, a 
tumultuous city, a joyous town? 

Thy slain are not slain with the 
sword, nor dead in battle. 

3All thy rulers are fled together, 

Without the bow they are bound; 

All that are found of thee are bound 
together, they are fled afar off. 

4Therefore said I: ‘Look away from 
me, I will weep bitterly; 

Strain not to comfort me, for the 
destruction of the daughter of my 
people.’ 

5For it is a day of trouble, and of 
trampling, and of perplexity, 

From the Lord, the GOD of hosts, in 
the Valley of Vision; 

Kir shouting, and Shoa at the mount. 

6And Elam bore the quiver, with 
troops of men, even horsemen; 

And Kir uncovered the shield. 

7And it came to pass, when thy 
choicest valleys were full of 
chariots, 

And the horsemen set themselves in 
array at the gate, 

8And the covering of Judah was laid 
bare, 

that thou didst look in that day to the 
armour in the house of the forest. 9And 
ye saw the breaches of the city of 
David, that they were many; and ye 
gathered together the waters of the 
lower pool. 10And ye numbered the 
houses of Jerusalem, and ye broke 
down the houses to fortify the wall; 22 




11ye made also a basin between the 
two walls for the water of the old 
pool— 

But ye looked not unto Him that had 
done this, 

Neither had ye respect unto Him 
that fashioned it long ago. 

12And in that day did the Lord, the 
GOD of hosts, call 

To weeping, and to lamentation, and 
to baldness, and to girding with 
sackcloth; 

13And behold joy and gladness, 

Slaying oxen and killing sheep, 

Eating flesh and drinking wine— 

’Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow 
we shall die! ’ 

14And the LORD of hosts revealed 
Himself in mine ears: 

Surely this iniquity shall not be 
expiated by you till ye die, 

Saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts. 

 

15Thus saith the Lord, the GOD of 
hosts: 

Go, get thee unto this steward, 

Even unto Shebna, who is over the 
house: 

16What hast thou here, and whom 
hast thou here, 

That thou hast hewed thee out here a 
sepulchre, 

Thou that hewest thee out a 
sepulchre on high, 

And gravest a habitation for thyself 
in the rock? 

17Behold, the LORD will hurl thee up 
and down with a man’s throw; 

Yea, He will wind thee round and 
round; 

18He will violently roll and toss 
thee like a ball into a large 
country; 

There shalt thou die, and there shall 
be the chariots of thy glory, 

Thou shame of the lord’s house. 

19And I will thrust thee from thy 
post, 

And from thy station shalt thou be 
pulled down. 

20And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 

That I will call my servant Eliakim 
the son of Hilkiah; 

21And I will clothe him with thy 
robe, 

And bind him with thy girdle, 

And I will commit thy government 
into his hand; 

And he shall be a father to the 
inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to 
the house of Judah. 

22And the key of the house of 
David will I lay upon his 
shoulder; 

And he shall open, and none shall 
shut; 

And he shall shut, and none shall 
open. 

23And I will fasten him as a peg in 
a sure place; 

And he shall be for a throne of 
honour to his father’s house. 

24And they shall hang upon him all the 
glory of his father’s house, the 
offspring and the issue, all vessels of 
small quantity, from the vessels of 


cups even to all the vessels of flagons. 
25In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, 
shall the peg that was fastened in a 
sure place give way; and it shall be 
hewn down, and fall, and the burden 
that was upon it shall be cut off; for 
the LORD hath spoken it. 

 

The burden of Tyre. 

 

Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, 

For it is laid waste, so that there is 
no house, no entering in; 

From the land of Kittim it is 
revealed to them. 

2Be still, ye inhabitants of the coast-
land; 

Thou whom the merchants of Zidon, 
that pass over the sea, have 
replenished. 

3And on great waters the seed of 
Shihor, 

The harvest of the Nile, was her 
revenue; 

And she was the mart of nations. 

4Be thou ashamed, O Zidon; for the 
sea hath spoken, 

The stronghold of the sea, saying: 

‘I have not travailed, nor brought 
forth, 

Neither have I reared young men, 
nor brought up virgins.’ 

5When the report cometh to Egypt, 

They shall be sorely pained at the 
report of Tyre. 

 

6Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye 
inhabitants of the coast-land. 

7Is this your joyous city, 

Whose feet in antiquity, 

In ancient days, 

Carried her afar off to sojourn? 

8Who hath devised this against Tyre, 
the crowning city, 

Whose merchants are princes, 

Whose traffickers are the 
honourable of the earth? 

9The LORD of hosts hath devised it, 

To pollute the pride of all glory, 

To bring into contempt all the 
honourable of the earth. 

10Overflow thy land as the Nile, 

O daughter of Tarshish! there is no 
girdle any more. 

11He hath stretched out His hand 
over the sea, 

He hath shaken the kingdoms; 

The LORD hath given commandment 
concerning Canaan, 

To destroy the strongholds thereof; 

12And He said: ‘Thou shalt no more 
rejoice.’ 

O thou oppressed virgin daughter of 
Zidon, 

Arise, pass over to Kittim; 

Even there shalt thou have no rest. 

13Behold, the land of the 
Chaldeans—this is the people that was 
not, when Asshur founded it for 
shipmen—they set up their towers, 
they overthrew the palaces thereof; it 
is made a ruin. 

14Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, 

For your stronghold is laid waste. 

 

15And it shall come to pass in that 
day, that Tyre shall be forgotten 
seventy years, according to the days of 
23 




one king; after the end of seventy 
years it shall fare with Tyre as in the 
song of the harlot: 

16Take a harp, 

Go about the city, 

Thou harlot long forgotten; 

Make sweet melody, 

Sing many songs, 

That thou mayest be remembered. 

17And it shall come to pass after the 
end of seventy years, that the LORD 
will remember Tyre, and she shall 
return to her hire, and shall have 
commerce with all the kingdoms of the 
world upon the face of the earth. 18And 
her gain and her hire shall be holiness 
to the LORD; it shall not be treasured 
nor laid up; for her gain shall be for 
them that dwell before the LORD, to eat 
their fill, and for stately clothing. 

 

Behold, the LORD maketh the 
earth empty and maketh it 
waste, 

And turneth it upside down, and 
scattereth abroad the inhabitants 
thereof. 

2And it shall be, as with the people, 
so with the priest; 

As with the servant, so with his 
master; 

As with the maid, so with her 
mistress; 

As with the buyer, so with the seller; 

As with the lender, so with the 
borrower; 

As with the creditor, so with the 
debtor. 

3The earth shall be utterly emptied, 
and clean despoiled; 

For the LORD hath spoken this word. 

4The earth fainteth and fadeth away, 

The world faileth and fadeth away, 

The lofty people of the earth do fail. 

5The earth also is defiled under the 
inhabitants thereof; 

Because they have transgressed the 
laws, violated the statute, 

Broken the everlasting covenant. 

6Therefore hath a curse devoured 
the earth, 

And they that dwell therein are 
found guilty; 

Therefore the inhabitants of the 
earth waste away, 

And men are left few. 

7The new wine faileth, the vine 
fadeth; 

All the merry-hearted do sigh. 

8The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, 

The noise of them that rejoice 
endeth, 

The joy of the harp ceaseth. 

9They drink not wine with a song; 

Strong drink is bitter to them that 
drink it. 

10Broken down is the city of 
wasteness; 

Every house is shut up, that none 
may come in. 

11There is a crying in the streets 
amidst the wine; 

All joy is darkened, 

The mirth of the land is gone. 

12In the city is left desolation, 

And the gate is smitten unto ruin. 
24 




13For thus shall it be in the midst of 
the earth, among the peoples, 

As at the beating of an olive-tree, 

As at the gleanings when the vintage 
is done. 

14Those yonder lift up their voice, 
they sing for joy; 

For the majesty of the LORD they 
shout from the sea: 

15’Therefore glorify ye the LORD in 
the regions of light, 

Even the name of the LORD, the God 
of Israel, in the isles of the sea.’ 

 

16From the uttermost part of the 
earth have we heard songs: ‘Glory 
to the righteous.’ 

But I say: I waste away, I waste 
away, woe is me! 

The treacherous deal treacherously; 

Yea, the treacherous deal very 
treacherously. 

17Terror, and the pit, and the trap, 
are upon thee, O inhabitant of the 
earth. 

18And it shall come to pass, that he 
who fleeth from the noise of the 
terror shall fall into the pit; 

And he that cometh up out of the 
midst of the pit shall be taken in 
the trap; 

For the windows on high are 
opened, 

And the foundations of the earth do 
shake; 

19The earth is broken, broken down, 

The earth is crumbled in pieces, 

The earth trembleth and tottereth; 

20The earth reeleth to and fro like a 
drunken man, 

And swayeth to and fro as a lodge; 

And the transgression thereof is 
heavy upon it, 

And it shall fall, and not rise again. 

21And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 

That the LORD will punish the host 
of the high heaven on high, 

And the kings of the earth upon the 
earth. 

22And they shall be gathered 
together, as prisoners are gathered 
in the dungeon, 

And shall be shut up in the prison, 

And after many days shall they be 
punished. 

23Then the moon shall be 
confounded, and the sun 
ashamed; 

For the LORD of hosts will reign in 
mount Zion, 

And in Jerusalem, and before His 
elders shall be Glory. 

 

O LORD, Thou art my God, 

I will exalt Thee, I will praise 
Thy name, 

For Thou hast done wonderful 
things; 

Even counsels of old, in faithfulness 
and truth. 

2For Thou hast made of a city a 
heap, 

Of a fortified city a ruin; 

A castle of strangers to be no city, 

It shall never be built. 
25 




3Therefore shall the strong people 
glorify Thee, 

The city of the terrible nations shall 
fear Thee. 

4For Thou hast been a stronghold to 
the poor, 

A stronghold to the needy in his 
distress, 

A refuge from the storm, a shadow 
from the heat; 

For the blast of the terrible ones was 
as a storm against the wall. 

5As the heat in a dry place, Thou 
didst subdue the noise of 
strangers; 

As the heat by the shadow of a 
cloud, the song of the terrible 
ones was brought low. 

 

6And in this mountain will the LORD 
of hosts make unto all peoples 

A feast of fat things, a feast of wines 
on the lees, 

Of fat things full of marrow, of 
wines on the lees well refined. 

7And He will destroy in this 
mountain 

The face of the covering that is cast 
over all peoples, 

And the veil that is spread over all 
nations. 

8He will swallow up death for ever; 

And the Lord GOD will wipe away 
tears from off all faces; 

And the reproach of His people will 
He take away from off all the 
earth; 

For the LORD hath spoken it. 

 

9And it shall be said in that day: 

‘Lo, this is our God, 

For whom we waited, that He might 
save us; 

This is the LORD, for whom we 
waited, 

We will be glad and rejoice in His 
salvation.’ 

10For in this mountain will the hand 
of the LORD rest, 

And Moab shall be trodden down in 
his place, 

Even as straw is trodden down in 
the dunghill. 

11And when he shall spread forth his 
hands in the midst thereof, 

As he that swimmeth spreadeth 
forth his hands to swim, 

His pride shall be brought down 
together with the cunning of his 
hands. 

12And the high fortress of thy walls 
will He bring down, lay low, 

And bring to the ground, even to the 
dust. 

 

In that day shall this song be 
sung in the land of Judah: 

We have a strong city; 

Walls and bulwarks doth He appoint 
for salvation. 

2Open ye the gates, 

That the righteous nation that 
keepeth faithfulness may enter in. 

3The mind stayed on Thee Thou 
keepest in perfect peace; 

Because it trusteth in Thee. 

4Trust ye in the LORD for ever, 
26 




For the LORD is GOD, an everlasting 
Rock. 

5For He hath brought down them 
that dwell on high, 

The lofty city, laying it low, laying 
it low even to the ground, 

Bringing it even to the dust. 

6The foot shall tread it down, 

Even the feet of the poor, and the 
steps of the needy. 

 

7The way of the just is straight; 

Thou, Most Upright, makest plain 
the path of the just. 

8Yea, in the way of Thy judgments, 

O LORD, have we waited for Thee; 

To Thy name and to Thy memorial 
is the desire of our soul. 

9With my soul have I desired Thee 
in the night; 

Yea, with my spirit within me have I 
sought Thee earnestly; 

For when Thy judgments are in the 
earth, 

The inhabitants of the world learn 
righteousness. 

10Let favour be shown to the 
wicked, yet will he not learn 
righteousness; 

In the land of uprightness will he 
deal wrongfully, 

And will not behold the majesty of 
the LORD. 

 

11LORD, Thy hand was lifted up, yet 
they see not; 

They shall see with shame Thy zeal 
for the people; 

Yea, fire shall devour Thine 
adversaries. 

12LORD, Thou wilt establish peace 
for us; 

For Thou hast indeed wrought all 
our works for us. 

13O LORD our God, other lords 
beside Thee have had dominion 
over us; 

But by Thee only do we make 
mention of Thy name. 

14The dead live not, the shades rise 
not; 

To that end hast Thou punished and 
destroyed them, 

And made all their memory to 
perish. 

15Thou hast gotten Thee honour with 
the nations, O LORD, 

Yea, exceeding great honour with 
the nations; 

Thou art honoured unto the farthest 
ends of the earth. 

 

16LORD, in trouble have they sought 
Thee, 

Silently they poured out a prayer 
when Thy chastening was upon 
them. 

17Like as a woman with child, that 
draweth near the time of her 
delivery, 

Is in pain and crieth out in her 
pangs; 

So have we been at Thy presence, O 
LORD. 

18We have been with child, we have 
been in pain, 


We have as it were brought forth 
wind; 

We have not wrought any 
deliverance in the land; 

Neither are the inhabitants of the 
world come to life. 

19Thy dead shall live, my dead 
bodies shall arise— 

Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the 
dust— 

For Thy dew is as the dew of light, 

And the earth shall bring to life the 
shades. 

 

20Come, my people, enter thou into 
thy chambers, 

And shut thy doors about thee; 

Hide thyself for a little moment, 

Until the indignation be overpast. 

21For, behold, the LORD cometh forth 
out of His place 

To visit upon the inhabitants of the 
earth their iniquity; 

The earth also shall disclose her 
blood, 

And shall no more cover her slain. 

In that day the LORD with His 
sore and great and strong 
sword will punish leviathan the slant 
serpent, and leviathan the tortuous 
serpent; and He will slay the dragon 
that is in the sea. 

2In that day sing ye of her: 

‘A vineyard of foaming wine! ’ 

3I the LORD do guard it, 

I water it every moment; 

Lest Mine anger visit it, 

I guard it night and day. 

4Fury is not in Me; 

Would that I were as the briers and 
thorns in flame! 

I would with one step burn it 
altogether. 

5Or else let him take hold of My 
strength, 

That he may make peace with Me; 
yea, let him make peace with Me. 

6In days to come shall Jacob take 
root, 

Israel shall blossom and bud; 

And the face of the world shall be 
filled with fruitage. 

 

7Hath He smitten him as He smote 
those that smote him? 

Or is he slain according to the 
slaughter of them that were slain 
by Him? 

8In full measure, when Thou sendest 
her away, Thou dost contend with 
her; 

He hath removed her with His rough 
blast in the day of the east wind. 

9Therefore by this shall the iniquity 
of Jacob be expiated, 

And this is all the fruit of taking 
away his sin: 

When he maketh all the stones of 
the altar as chalkstones that are 
beaten in pieces, 

So that the Asherim and the sun-
images shall rise no more. 

10For the fortified city is solitary, 

A habitation abandoned and 
forsaken, like the wilderness; 

There shall the calf feed, and there 
shall he lie down, 

And consume the branches thereof 
27 




11When the boughs thereof are 
withered, 

They shall be broken off; 

The women shall come, and set 
them on fire; 

For it is a people of no 
understanding; 

Therefore He that made them will 
not have compassion upon them, 

And He that formed them will not 
be gracious unto them. 

 

12And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 

That the LORD will beat off [His 
fruit] 

From the flood of the River unto the 
Brook of Egypt, 

And ye shall be gathered one by 
one, O ye children of Israel. 

 

13And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 

That a great horn shall be blown; 

And they shall come that were lost 
in the land of Assyria, 

And they that were dispersed in the 
land of Egypt; 

And they shall worship the LORD in 
the holy mountain at Jerusalem. 

 

Woe to the crown of pride of 
the drunkards of Ephraim, 

And to the fading flower of his 
glorious beauty, 

Which is on the head of the fat 
valley of them that are smitten 
down with wine! 

2Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and 
strong one, 

As a storm of hail, a tempest of 
destruction, 

As a storm of mighty waters 
overflowing, 

That casteth down to the earth with 
violence. 

3The crown of pride of the 
drunkards of Ephraim 

Shall be trodden under foot; 

4And the fading flower of his 
glorious beauty, 

Which is on the head of the fat 
valley, 

Shall be as the first-ripe fig before 
the summer, 

Which when one looketh upon it, 

While it is yet in his hand he eateth 
it up. 

 

5In that day shall the LORD of hosts 
be 

For a crown of glory, and for a 
diadem of beauty, 

Unto the residue of His people; 

6And for a spirit of judgment to him 
that sitteth in judgment, 

And for strength to them that turn 
back the battle at the gate. 

 

7But these also reel through wine, 

And stagger through strong drink; 

The priest and the prophet reel 
through strong drink, 

They are confused because of wine, 

They stagger because of strong 
drink; 
28 




They reel in vision, they totter in 
judgment. 

8For all tables are full of filthy 
vomit, and no place is clean. 

 

9Whom shall one teach knowledge? 

And whom shall one make to 
understand the message? 

Them that are weaned from the 
milk, 

Them that are drawn from the 
breasts? 

10For it is precept by precept, 
precept by precept, 

Line by line, line by line; 

Here a little, there a little. 

11For with stammering lips and with 
a strange tongue 

Shall it be spoken to this people; 

12To whom it was said: ‘This is the 
rest, 

Give ye rest to the weary; 

And this is the refreshing’; 

Yet they would not hear. 

13And so the word of the LORD is 
unto them 

Precept by precept, precept by 
precept, 

Line by line, line by line; 

Here a little, there a little; 

That they may go, and fall 
backward, and be broken, 

And snared, and taken. 

 

14Wherefore hear the word of the 
LORD, ye scoffers, 

The ballad-mongers of this people 
which is in Jerusalem: 

15Because ye have said: ‘We have 
made a covenant with death, 

And with the nether-world are we at 
agreement; 

When the scouring scourge shall 
pass through, 

It shall not come unto us; 

For we have made lies our refuge, 

And in falsehood have we hid 
ourselves’; 

16Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 

Behold, I lay in Zion for a 
foundation a stone, 

A tried stone, a costly corner-stone 
of sure foundation; 

He that believeth shall not make 
haste. 

17And I will make justice the line, 

And righteousness the plummet; 

And the hail shall sweep away the 
refuge of lies, 

And the waters shall overflow the 
hiding-place. 

18And your covenant with death 
shall be disannulled 

And your agreement with the 
nether-world shall not stand; 

When the scouring scourge shall 
pass through, 

Then ye shall be trodden down by it, 

19As often as it passeth through, it 
shall take you; 

For morning by morning shall it 
pass through, 

By day and by night; 

And it shall be sheer terror to 
understand the message. 

20For the bed is too short for a man 
to stretch himself; 


And the covering too narrow when 
he gathereth himself up. 

21For the LORD will rise up as in 
mount Perazim, 

He will be wroth as in the valley of 
Gibeon; 

That He may do His work, strange is 
His work, 

And bring to pass His act, strange is 
His act. 

22Now therefore be ye not scoffers, 

Lest your bands be made strong; 

For an extermination wholly 
determined have I heard from the 
Lord, the GOD of hosts, 

Upon the whole land. 

 

23Give ye ear, and hear my voice; 
attend, and hear my speech. 

24Is the plowman never done with 
plowing to sow, 

With the opening and harrowing of 
his ground? 

25When he hath made plain the face 
thereof, 

Doth he not cast abroad the black 
cummin, and scatter the cummin, 

And put in the wheat in rows and 
the barley in the appointed place 

And the spelt in the border thereof? 

26For He doth instruct him aright; 

His God doth teach him. 

27For the black cummin is not 
threshed with a threshing-sledge, 

Neither is a cart-wheel turned about 
upon the cummin; 

But the black cummin is beaten out 
with a staff, 

And the cummin with a rod. 

28Is bread corn crushed? 

Nay, he will not ever be threshing it; 

And though the roller of his wagon 
and its sharp edges move noisily, 

He doth not crush it. 

29This also cometh forth from the 
LORD of hosts: 

Wonderful is His counsel, and great 
His wisdom. 

 

29 



Ah, aAriel, Ariel, the city 
where David encamped! 

a That is, The hearth of God. 

Add ye year to year, 

Let the feasts come round! 

2Then will I distress Ariel, 

And there shall be mourning and 
moaning; and she shall be unto 
Me as a hearth of God. 

3And I will encamp against thee 
round about, 

And will lay siege against thee with 
a mound, 

And I will raise siege works against 
thee. 

4And brought down thou shalt 
speak out of the ground, 

And thy speech shall be low out of 
the dust; 

And thy voice shall be as of a ghost 
out of the ground, 

And thy speech shall chirp out of 
the dust. 

5But the multitude of thy foes shall 
be like small dust, 

And the multitude of the terrible 
ones as chaff that passeth away; 


Yea, it shall be at an instant 
suddenly— 

6There shall be a visitation from the 
LORD of hosts 

With thunder, and with earthquake, 
and great noise, 

With whirlwind and tempest, and 
the flame of a devouring fire. 

7And the multitude of all the 
nations that war against Ariel, 

Even all that war against her, and 
the bulwarks about her, and they 
that distress her, 

Shall be as a dream, a vision of the 
night. 

8And it shall be as when a hungry 
man dreameth, and, behold, he 
eateth, 

But he awaketh, and his soul is 
empty; 

Or as when a thirsty man dreameth, 
and, behold, he drinketh, 

But he awaketh, and, behold, he is 
faint, and his soul hath 
appetite— 

So shall the multitude of all the 
nations be, that fight against 
mount Zion. 

 

9Stupefy yourselves, and be stupid! 

Blind yourselves, and be blind! 

Ye that are drunken, but not with 
wine, 

That stagger, but not with strong 
drink. 

10For the LORD hath poured out 
upon you the spirit of deep 
sleep, 

And hath closed your eyes; 

The prophets, and your heads, the 
seers, hath He covered. 

11And the vision of all this is 
become unto you as the words of a 
writing that is sealed, which men 
deliver to one that is learned, saying: 
‘Read this, I pray thee’; and he saith: ‘I 
cannot, for it is sealed’; 12and the 
writing is delivered to him that is not 
learned, saying: ‘Read this, I pray 
thee’; and he saith: ‘I am not learned.’ 

 

13And the Lord said: Forasmuch as 
this people draw near, 

And with their mouth and with 
their lips do honour Me, 

But have removed their heart far 
from Me, 

And their fear of Me is a 
command-ment of men learned 
by rote; 

14Therefore, behold, I will again do 
a marvellous work among this 
people, 

Even a marvellous work and a 
wonder; 

And the wisdom of their wise men 
shall perish, 

And the prudence of their prudent 
men shall be hid. 

 

15Woe unto them that seek deep to 
hide their counsel from the 
LORD, 

And their works are in the dark, 

And they say: ‘Who seeth us? and 
who knoweth us?’ 

16O your perversity! 


Shall the potter be esteemed as 
clay; 

That the thing made should say of 
him that made it: ‘He made me 
not’; 

Or the thing framed say of him that 
framed it: ‘He hath no 
understanding?’ 

17Is it not yet a very little while, 

And Lebanon shall be turned into a 
fruitful field, 

And the fruitful field shall be 
esteemed as a forest? 

18And in that day shall the deaf hear 
the words of a book, 

And the eyes of the blind shall see 
out of obscurity and out of 
darkness. 

19The humble also shall increase 
their joy in the LORD, 

And the neediest among men shall 
exult in the Holy One of Israel. 

20For the terrible one is brought to 
nought, 

And the scorner ceaseth, 

And all they that watch for iniquity 
are cut off; 

21That make a man an offender by 
words, 

And lay a snare for him that 
reproveth in the gate, 

And turn aside the just with a thing 
of nought. 

22Therefore thus saith the LORD, who 
redeemed Abraham, concerning the 
house of Jacob: 

Jacob shall not now be ashamed, 

Neither shall his face now wax 
pale; 

23When he seeth his children, the 
work of My hands, in the midst 
of him, 

That they sanctify My name; 

Yea, they shall sanctify the Holy 
One of Jacob, 

And shall stand in awe of the God 
of Israel. 

24They also that err in spirit shall 
come to understanding, 

And they that murmur shall learn 
instruction. 

 

Woe to the rebellious children, 
saith the LORD, 

That take counsel, but not of Me; 

And that form projects, but not of 
My spirit, 

That they may add sin to sin; 

2That walk to go down into Egypt, 

And have not asked at My mouth; 

To take refuge in the stronghold of 
Pharaoh, 

And to take shelter in the shadow 
of Egypt! 

3Therefore shall the stronghold of 
Pharaoh turn to your shame, 

And the shelter in the shadow of 
Egypt to your confusion. 

4For his princes are at Zoan, 

And his ambassadors are come to 
Hanes. 

5They shall all be ashamed of a 
people that cannot profit them, 

That are not a help nor profit, 

But a shame, and also a reproach. 

 

6The burden of the beasts of the 
South. 
30 




 

Through the land of trouble and 
anguish, 

From whence come the lioness and 
the lion, 

The viper and flying serpent, 

They carry their riches upon the 
shoulders of young asses, 

And their treasures upon the humps 
of camels, 

To a people that shall not profit 
them. 

7For Egypt helpeth in vain, and to 
no purpose; 

Therefore have I called her 
arrogancy that sitteth still. 

8Now go, write it before them on a 
tablet, 

And inscribe it in a book, 

That it may be for the time to come 

For ever and ever. 

9For it is a rebellious people, 

Lying children, 

Children that refuse to hear the 
teaching of the LORD; 

10That say to the seers: ‘See not’, 

And to the prophets: ‘Prophesy not 
unto us right things, 

Speak unto us smooth things, 
prophesy delusions; 

11Get you out of the way, 

Turn aside out of the path, 

Cause the Holy One of Israel 

To cease from before us.’ 

12Wherefore thus saith the Holy 
One of Israel: 

Because ye despise this word, 

And trust in oppression and 
perverseness, 

And stay thereon; 

13Therefore this iniquity shall be to 
you 

As a breach ready to fall, swelling 
out in a high wall, 

Whose breaking cometh suddenly 
at an instant. 

14And He shall break it as a potter’s 
vessel is broken, 

Breaking it in pieces without 
sparing; 

So that there shall not be found 
among the pieces thereof a 
sherd 

To take fire from the hearth, 

Or to take water out of the cistern. 

 

15For thus said the Lord GOD, the 
Holy One of Israel: 

In sitting still and rest shall ye be 
saved, 

In quietness and in confidence shall 
be your strength; 

And ye would not. 

16But ye said: ‘No, for we will flee 
upon horses’; 

Therefore shall ye flee; 

And: ‘We will ride upon the swift’; 

Therefore shall they that pursue 
you be swift. 

17One thousand shall flee at the 
rebuke of one, 

At the rebuke of five shall ye flee; 

Till ye be left as a beacon upon the 
top of a mountain, 

And as an ensign on a hill. 

18And therefore will the LORD wait, 
that He may be gracious unto 
you, 


And therefore will He be exalted, 
that He may have compassion 
upon you; 

For the LORD is a God of justice, 

Happy are all they that wait for 
Him. 

 

19For, O people that dwellest in 
Zion at Jerusalem, 

Thou shalt weep no more; 

He will surely be gracious unto 
thee at the voice of thy cry, 

When He shall hear, He will 
answer thee. 

20And though the Lord give you 
sparing bread and scant water, 

Yet shall not thy Teacher hide 
Himself any more, 

But thine eyes shall see thy 
Teacher; 

21And thine ears shall hear a word 
behind thee, saying: 

‘This is the way, walk ye in it, 

When ye turn to the right hand, and 
when ye turn to the left.’ 

22And ye shall defile thy graven 
images overlaid with silver, 

And thy molten images covered 
with gold; 

Thou shalt put them far away as 
one unclean; 

Thou shalt say unto it: ‘Get thee 
hence.’ 

23And He will give the rain for thy 
seed, wherewith thou sowest the 
ground, 

And bread of the increase of the 
ground, and it shall be fat and 
plenteous; 

In that day shall thy cattle feed in 
large pastures. 

24The oxen likewise and the young 
asses that till the ground 

Shall eat savoury provender, 

Wwhich hath been winnowed with 
the shovel and with the fan. 

25And there shall be upon every 
lofty mountain, and upon every 
high hill 

Streams and watercourses, 

In the day of the great slaughter, 
when the towers fall. 

26Moreover the light of the moon 
shall be as the light of the sun, 

And the light of the sun shall be 
sevenfold, as the light of the 
seven days, 

In the day that the LORD bindeth up 
the bruise of His people, 

And healeth the stroke of their 
wound. 

 

27Behold, the name of the LORD 
cometh from far, 

With His anger burning, and in 
thick uplifting of smoke; 

His lips are full of indignation, 

And His tongue is as a devouring 
fire; 

28And His breath is as an 
overflowing stream, 

That divideth even unto the neck, 

To sift the nations with the sieve of 
destruction; 

And a bridle that causeth to err 
shall be in the jaws of the 
peoples. 

29Ye shall have a song 


As in the night when a feast is 
hallowed; 

And gladness of heart, as when one 
goeth with the pipe 

To come into the mountain of the 
LORD, to the Rock of Israel. 

30And the LORD will cause His 
glorious voice to be heard, 

And will show the lighting down of 
His arm, 

With furious anger, and the flame 
of a devouring fire, 

With a bursting of clouds, and a 
storm of rain, and hailstones. 

31For through the voice of the LORD 
shall Asshur be dismayed, 

The rod with which He smote. 

32And in every place where the 
appointed staff shall pass, 

Which the LORD shall lay upon him, 

It shall be with tabrets and harps; 

And in battles of wielding will He 
fight with them. 

33For a hearth is ordered of old; 

Yea, for the king it is prepared, 

Deep and large; 

The pile thereof is fire and much 
wood; 

The breath of the LORD, like a 
stream of brimstone, doth kindle 
it. 

 

Woe to them that go down to 
Egypt for help, 

And rely on horses, 

And trust in chariots, because they 
are many, 

And in horsemen, because they are 
exceeding mighty; 

But they look not unto the Holy One 
of Israel, 

Neither seek the LORD! 

2Yet He also is wise, 

And bringeth evil, 

And doth not call back His words; 

But will arise against the house of 
the evil-doers, 

And against the help of them that 
work iniquity. 

3Now the Egyptians are men, and 
not God, 

And their horses flesh, and not 
spirit; 

So when the LORD shall stretch out 
His hand, 

Both he that helpeth shall stumble, 
and he that is helped shall fall, 

And they all shall perish together. 

 

4For thus saith the LORD unto me: 

Like as the lion, or the young lion, 
growling over his prey, 

Though a multitude of shepherds be 
called forth against him, 

Will not be dismayed at their voice, 

Nor abase himself for the noise of 
them; 

So will the LORD of hosts come 
down 

To fight upon mount Zion, and upon 
the hill thereof. 

5As birds hovering, 

So will the LORD of hosts protect 
Jerusalem; 

He will deliver it as He protecteth it, 

He will rescue it as He passeth over. 

6Turn ye unto Him 
31 




Against whom ye have deeply 
rebelled, O children of Israel. 

7For in that day they shall cast away 
every man his idols of silver, and 
his idols of gold, 

Which your own hands have made 
unto you for a sin. 

8Then shall Asshur fall with the 
sword, not of man, 

And the sword, not of men, shall 
devour him; 

And he shall flee from the sword, 

And his young men shall become 
tributary. 

9And his rock shall pass away by 
reason of terror, 

And his princes shall be dismayed at 
the ensign, 

Saith the LORD, whose fire is in 
Zion, 

And His furnace in Jerusalem. 

 

Behold, a king shall reign in 
righteousness, 

And as for princes, they shall rule in 
justice. 

2And a man shall be as in a hiding-
place from the wind, 

And a covert from the tempest; 

As by the watercourses in a dry 
place, 

As in the shadow of a great rock in a 
weary land. 

3And the eyes of them that see shall 
not be closed, 

And the ears of them that hear shall 
attend. 

4The heart also of the rash shall 
understand knowledge, 

And the tongue of the stammerers 
shall be ready to speak plainly. 

5The vile person shall be no more 
called liberal, 

Nor the churl said to be noble. 

6For the vile person will speak 
villainy, 

And his heart will work iniquity, 

To practise ungodliness, and to utter 
wickedness against the LORD, 

To make empty the soul of the 
hungry, 

And to cause the drink of the thirsty 
to fail. 

7The instruments also of the churl 
are evil; 

He deviseth wicked devices 

To destroy the poor with lying 
words, 

And the needy when he speaketh 
right. 

8But the liberal deviseth liberal 
things; 

And by liberal things shall he stand. 

 

9Rise up, ye women that are at ease, 
and hear my voice; 

Ye confident daughters, give ear 
unto my speech. 

10After a year and days shall ye be 
troubled, ye confident women; 

For the vintage shall fail, the 
ingathering shall not come. 

11Tremble, ye women that are at 
ease; 

Be troubled, ye confident ones; 

Strip you, and make you bare, 

And gird sackcloth upon your loins, 

12Smiting upon the breasts 
32 




For the pleasant fields, for the 
fruitful vine; 

13For the land of my people 

Whereon thorns and briers come up; 

Yea, for all the houses of joy 

And the joyous city. 

14For the palace shall be forsaken; 

The city with its stir shall be 
deserted; 

The mound and the tower shall be 
for dens for ever, 

A joy of wild asses, a pasture of 
flocks; 

15Until the spirit be poured upon us 
from on high, 

And the wilderness become a 
fruitful field, 

And the fruitful field be counted for 
a forest. 

16Then justice shall dwell in the 
wilderness, 

And righteousness shall abide in the 
fruitful field. 

17And the work of righteousness 
shall be peace; 

And the effect of righteousness 
quietness and confidence for ever. 

18And my people shall abide in a 
peaceable habitation, 

And in secure dwellings, and in 
quiet resting-places. 

19And it shall hail, in the downfall of 
the forest; 

But the city shall descend into the 
valley. 

20Happy are ye that sow beside all 
waters, 

That send forth freely the feet of the 
ox and the ass. 

 

Woe to thee that spoilest, and 
thou wast not spoiled; 

And dealest treacherously, and they 
dealt not treacherously with thee! 

When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou 
shalt be spoiled; 

And when thou art weary with 
dealing treacherously, they shall 
deal treacherously with thee. 

 

2O LORD, be gracious unto us; 

We have waited for Thee; 

Be Thou their arm every morning, 

Our salvation also in the time of 
trouble. 

3At the noise of the tumult the 
peoples are fled; 

At the lifting up of Thyself the 
nations are scattered. 

4And your spoil is gathered as the 
caterpillar gathereth; 

As locusts leap do they leap upon it. 

5The LORD is exalted, for He 
dwelleth on high; 

He hath filled Zion with justice and 
righteousness. 

6And the stability of thy times shall 
be 

A hoard of salvation—wisdom and 
knowledge, 

And the fear of the LORD which is 
His treasure. 

 

7Behold, their valiant ones cry 
without; 

The ambassadors of peace weep 
bitterly. 

8The highways lie waste, 
33 




The wayfaring man ceaseth; 

He hath broken the covenant, 

He hath despised the cities, 

He regardeth not man. 

9The land mourneth and 
languisheth; 

Lebanon is ashamed, it withereth; 

Sharon is like a wilderness; 

And Bashan and Carmel are clean 
bare. 

 

10Now will I arise, saith the LORD; 

Now will I be exalted; 

Now will I lift Myself up. 

11Ye conceive chaff, ye shall bring 
forth stubble; 

Your breath is a fire that shall 
devour you. 

12And the peoples shall be as the 
burnings of lime; 

As thorns cut down, that are burned 
in the fire. 

 

13Hear, ye that are far off, what I 
have done; 

And, ye that are near, acknowledge 
My might. 

14The sinners in Zion are afraid; 

Trembling hath seized the ungodly: 

‘Who among us shall dwell with the 
devouring fire? 

Who among us shall dwell with 
everlasting burnings?’ 

15He that walketh righteously, and 
speaketh uprightly; 

He that despiseth the gain of 
oppressions, 

That shaketh his hands from holding 
of bribes, 

That stoppeth his ears from hearing 
of blood, 

And shutteth his eyes from looking 
upon evil; 

16He shall dwell on high; 

His place of defence shall be the 
munitions of rocks; 

His bread shall be given, his waters 
shall be sure. 

 

17Thine eyes shall see the king in his 
beauty; 

They shall behold a land stretching 
afar. 

18Thy heart shall muse on the terror: 

‘Where is he that counted, where is 
he that weighed? 

Where is he that counted the 
towers?’ 

19Thou shalt not see the fierce 
people; 

A people of a deep speech that thou 
canst not perceive, 

Of a stammering tongue that thou 
canst not understand. 

20Look upon Zion, the city of our 
solemn gatherings; 

Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a 
peaceful habitation, 

A tent that shall not be removed, 

The stakes whereof shall never be 
plucked up, 

Neither shall any of the cords 
thereof be broken. 

21But there the LORD will be with us 
in majesty, 

In a place of broad rivers and 
streams; 


Wherein shall go no galley with 
oars, 

Neither shall gallant ship pass 
thereby. 

22For the LORD is our Judge, 

The LORD is our Lawgiver, 

The LORD is our King; 

He will save us. 

23Thy tacklings are loosed; 

They do not hold the stand of their 
mast, 

They do not spread the sail; 

Then is the prey of a great spoil 
divided; 

The lame take the prey. 

24And the inhabitant shall not say: ‘I 
am sick’; 

The people that dwell therein shall 
be forgiven their iniquity. 

 

Come near, ye nations, to hear, 
And attend, ye peoples; 

Let the earth hear, and the fulness 
thereof, 

The world, and all things that come 
forth of it. 

2For the LORD hath indignation 
against all the nations, 

And fury against all their host; 

He hath utterly destroyed them, 

He hath delivered them to the 
slaughter. 

3Their slain also shall be cast out, 

And the stench of their carcasses 
shall come up, 

And the mountains shall be melted 
with their blood. 

4And all the host of heaven shall 
moulder away, 

And the heavens shall be rolled 
together as a scroll; 

And all their host shall fall down, 

As the leaf falleth off from the vine, 

And as a falling fig from the fig-
tree. 

5For My sword hath drunk its fill in 
heaven; 

Behold, it shall come down upon 
Edom, 

And upon the people of My ban, to 
judgment. 

6The sword of the LORD is filled with 
blood, 

It is made fat with fatness, 

With the blood of lambs and goats, 

With the fat of the kidneys of rams; 

For the LORD hath a sacrifice in 
Bozrah, 

And a great slaughter in the land of 
Edom. 

7And the wild-oxen shall come 
down with them, 

And the bullocks with the bulls; 

And their land shall be drunken with 
blood, 

And their dust made fat with 
fatness. 

8For the LORD hath a day of 
vengeance, 

A year of recompense for the 
controversy of Zion. 

9And the streams thereof shall be 
turned into pitch, 

And the dust thereof into brimstone, 

And the land thereof shall become 
burning pitch. 

10It shall not be quenched night nor 
day, 
34 




The smoke thereof shall go up for 
ever; 

From generation to generation it 
shall lie waste: 

None shall pass through it for ever 
and ever. 

11But the pelican and the bittern 
shall possess it, 

And the owl and the raven shall 
dwell therein; 

And He shall stretch over it 

The line of confusion, and the 
plummet of emptiness. 

12As for her nobles, none shall be 
there to be called to the kingdom; 

And all her princes shall be nothing. 

13And thorns shall come up in her 
palaces, 

Nettles and thistles in the fortresses 
thereof; 

And it shall be a habitation of wild-
dogs, 

An enclosure for ostriches. 

14And the wild-cats shall meet with 
the jackals, 

And the satyr shall cry to his fellow; 

Yea, the night-monster shall repose 
there, 

And shall find her a place of rest. 

15There shall the arrowsnake make 
her nest, and lay, 

And hatch, and brood under her 
shadow; 

Yea, there shall the kites be 
gathered, 

Every one with her mate. 

16Seek ye out of the book of the 
LORD, and read; 

No one of these shall be missing, 

None shall want her mate; 

For My mouth it hath commanded, 

And the breath thereof it hath 
gathered them. 

17And He hath cast the lot for them, 

And His hand hath divided it unto 
them by line; 

They shall possess it for ever, 

From generation to generation shall 
they dwell therein. 

 

The wilderness and the 
parched land shall be glad; 

And the desert shall rejoice, and 
blossom as the rose. 

2It shall blossom abundantly, and 
rejoice, 

Even with joy and singing; 

The glory of Lebanon shall be given 
unto it, 

The excellency of Carmel and 
Sharon; 

They shall see the glory of the LORD, 

The excellency of our God. 

3Strengthen ye the weak hands, 

And make firm the tottering knees. 

4Say to them that are of a fearful 
heart: ‘Be strong, fear not’; 

Behold, your God will come with 
vengeance, 

With the recompense of God He 
will come and save you. 

 

5Then the eyes of the blind shall be 
opened, 

And the ears of the deaf shall be 
unstopped. 

6Then shall the lame man leap as a 
hart, 
35 




And the tongue of the dumb shall 
sing; 

For in the wilderness shall waters 
break out, 

And streams in the desert. 

7And the parched land shall become 
a pool, 

And the thirsty ground springs of 
water; 

In the habitation of jackals herds 
shall lie down, 

It shall be an enclosure for reeds and 
rushes. 

8And a highway shall be there, and a 
way, 

And it shall be called The way of 
holiness; 

The unclean shall not pass over it; 
but it shall be for those; 

The wayfaring men, yea fools, shall 
not err therein. 

9No lion shall be there, 

Nor shall any ravenous beast go up 
thereon, 

They shall not be found there; 

But the redeemed shall walk there; 

10And the ransomed of the LORD 
shall return, 

And come with singing unto Zion, 

And everlasting joy shall be upon 
their heads; 

They shall obtain gladness and joy, 

And sorrow and sighing shall flee 
away. 

 

Now it came to pass in the 
fourteenth year of king 
Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of 
Assyria came up against all the 
fortified cities of Judah, and took 
them. 2And the king of Assyria sent 
Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem 
unto king Hezekiah with a great army. 
And he stood by the conduit of the 
upper pool in the highway of the 
fullers’field. 3Then came forth unto 
him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that 
was over the household, and Shebna 
the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph 
the recorder. 4And Rab-shakeh said 
unto them: ‘Say ye now to Hezekiah: 
Thus saith the great king, the king of 
Assyria: What confidence is this 
wherein thou trustest? 5I said: It is but 
vain words; for counsel and strength 
are for the war. Now on whom dost 
thou trust, that thou hast rebelled 
against me? 6Behold, thou trustest 
upon the staff of this bruised reed, 
even upon Egypt; whereon if a man 
lean, it will go into his hand, and 
pierce it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt 
to all that trust on him. 7But if thou say 
unto me: We trust in the LORD our 
God; is not that He, whose high places 
and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken 
away, and hath said to Judah and to 
Jerusalem: Ye shall worship before 
this altar? 8Now therefore, I pray thee, 
make a wager with my master, the 
king of Assyria, and I will give thee 
two thousand horses, if thou be able on 
thy part to set riders upon them. 9How 
then canst thou turn away the face of 
one captain, even of the least of my 
master’s servants? yet thou puttest thy 
trust on Egypt for chariots and for 
horsemen! 10And am I now come up 
36 




without the LORD against this land to 
destroy it? The LORD said unto me: Go 
up against this land, and destroy it.’ 

11Then said Eliakim and Shebna and 
Joah unto Rab-shakeh: ‘Speak, I pray 
thee, unto thy servants in the Aramean 
language, for we understand it; and 
speak not to us in the Jews’language, 
in the ears of the people that are on the 
wall.’ 12But Rab-shakeh said: ‘Hath 
my master sent me to thy master, and 
to thee, to speak these words? hath he 
not sent me to the men that sit upon 
the wall, to eat their own dung, and to 
drink their own water with you?’ 
13Then Rab-shakeh stood, and cried 
with a loud voice in the 
Jews’language, and said: ‘Hear ye the 
words of the great king, the king of 
Assyria. 14Thus saith the king: Let not 
Hezekiah beguile you, for he will not 
be able to deliver you; 15neither let 
Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, 
saying: The LORD will surely deliver 
us; this city shall not be given into the 
hand of the king of Assyria. 16Hearken 
not to Hezekiah; for thus saith the king 
of Assyria: Make your peace with me, 
and come out to me; and eat ye every 
one of his vine, and every one of his 
fig-tree, and drink ye every one the 
waters of his own cistern; 17until I 
come and take you away to a land like 
your own land, a land of corn and 
wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
18Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, 
saying: The LORD will deliver us. Hath 
any of the gods of the nations 
delivered his land out of the hand of 
the king of Assyria? 19Where are the 
gods of Hamath and Arpad? where are 
the gods of Sepharvaim? and have 
they delivered Samaria out of my 
hand? 20Who are they among all the 
gods of these countries, that have 
delivered their country out of my hand, 
that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem 
out of my hand?’ 

21But they held their peace, and 
answered him not a word; for the 
king’s commandment was, saying: 
‘Answer him not.’ 22Then came 
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, that was 
over the household, and Shebna the 
scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the 
recorder, to Hezekiah with their 
clothes rent, and told him the words of 
Rab-shakeh. 

And it came to pass, when 
king Hezekiah heard it, that he 
rent his clothes, and covered himself 
with sackcloth, and went into the 
house of the LORD. 2And he sent 
Eliakim, who was over the household, 
and Shebna the scribe, and the elders 
of the priests, covered with sackcloth, 
unto Isaiah the prophet the son of 
Amoz. 3And they said unto him: ‘Thus 
saith Hezekiah: This day is a day of 
trouble, and of rebuke, and of 
contumely; for the children are come 
to the birth, and there is not strength to 
bring forth. 4It may be the LORD thy 
God will hear the words of Rab-
shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his 
master hath sent to taunt the living 
God, and will rebuke the words which 
the LORD thy God hath heard; 
37 




wherefore make prayer for the remnant 
that is left.’ 5So the servants of king 
Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 6And Isaiah 
said unto them: ‘Thus shall ye say to 
your master: Thus saith the LORD: Be 
not afraid of the words that thou hast 
heard, wherewith the servants of the 
king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. 
7Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and 
he shall hear a rumour, and shall return 
unto his own land; and I will cause 
him to fall by the sword in his own 
land.’ 

8So Rab-shakeh returned, and found 
the king of Assyria warring against 
Libnah; for he had heard that he was 
departed from Lachish. 9And he heard 
say concerning Tirhakah king of 
Ethiopia: ‘He is come out to fight 
against thee.’ And when he heard it, he 
sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying: 
10’Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah 
king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God 
in whom thou trustest beguile thee, 
saying: Jerusalem shall not be given 
into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
11Behold, thou hast heard what the 
kings of Assyria have done to all 
lands, by destroying them utterly; and 
shalt thou be delivered? 12Have the 
gods of the nations delivered them, 
which my fathers have destroyed, 
Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and 
the children of Eden that were in 
Telassar? 13Where is the king of 
Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and 
the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of 
Hena, and Ivvah?’ 

14And Hezekiah received the letter 
from the hand of the messengers, and 
read it; and Hezekiah went up unto the 
house of the LORD, and spread it before 
the LORD. 15And Hezekiah prayed unto 
the LORD, saying: 16’O LORD of hosts, 
the God of Israel, that sittest upon the 
cherubim, Thou art the God, even 
Thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the 
earth; Thou hast made heaven and 
earth. 17Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and 
hear; open Thine eyes, O LORD, and 
see; and hear all the words of 
Sennacherib, who hath sent to taunt 
the living God. 18Of a truth, LORD, the 
kings of Assyria have laid waste all the 
countries, and their land, 19and have 
cast their gods into the fire; for they 
were no gods, but the work of men’s 
hands, wood and stone; therefore they 
have destroyed them. 20Now therefore, 
O LORD our God, save us from his 
hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth 
may know that Thou art the LORD, 
even Thou only.’ 

21Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent 
unto Hezekiah, saying: ‘Thus saith the 
LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou 
hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib 
king of Assyria, 22this is the word 
which the LORD hath spoken 
concerning him: 

The virgin daughter of Zion 

Hath despised thee and laughed thee 
to scorn; 

The daughter of Jerusalem 

Hath shaken her head at thee. 

23Whom hast thou taunted and 
blasphemed? 


And against whom hast thou exalted 
thy voice? 

Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes 
on high, 

Even against the Holy One of Israel! 

24By thy servants hast thou taunted 
the Lord, 

And hast said: With the multitude of 
my chariots 

Am I come up to the height of the 
mountains, 

To the innermost parts of Lebanon; 

And I have cut down the tall cedars 
thereof, 

And the choice cypress-trees 
thereof; 

And I have entered into his farthest 
height, 

The forest of his fruitful field. 

25I have digged and drunk water, 

And with the sole of my feet have I 
dried up 

All the rivers of Egypt. 

26Hast thou not heard? 

Long ago I made it, 

In ancient times I fashioned it; 

Now have I brought it to pass, 

Yea, it is done; that fortified cities 

Should be laid waste into ruinous 
heaps. 

27Therefore their inhabitants were of 
small power, 

They were dismayed and 
confounded; 

They were as the grass of the field, 

And as the green herb, 

As the grass on the housetops, 

And as a field of corn before it is 
grown up. 

 

28But I know thy sitting down, and 
thy going out, and thy coming in, 

And thy raging against Me. 

29Because of thy raging against Me, 

And for that thine uproar is come up 
into Mine ears, 

Therefore will I put My hook in thy 
nose, 

And My bridle in thy lips, 

And I will turn thee back by the way 

By which thou camest. 

30And this shall be the sign unto thee: 
ye shall eat this year that which 
groweth of itself, and in the second 
year that which springeth of the same; 
and in the third year sow ye, and reap, 
and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit 
thereof. 31And the remnant that is 
escaped of the house of Judah shall 
again take root downward, and bear 
fruit upward. 32For out of Jerusalem 
shall go forth a remnant, and out of 
mount Zion they that shall escape; the 
zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform 
this. 33Therefore thus saith the LORD 
concerning the king of Assyria: He 
shall not come unto this city, nor shoot 
an arrow there, neither shall he come 
before it with shield, nor cast a mound 
against it. 34By the way that he came, 
by the same shall he return, and he 
shall not come unto this city, saith the 
LORD. 35For I will defend this city to 
save it, for Mine own sake, and for My 
servant David’s sake.’ 36And the angel 
of the LORD went forth, and smote in 
the camp of the Assyrians a hundred 
and fourscore and five thousand; and 


when men arose early in the morning, 
behold, they were all dead corpses. 
37So Sennacherib king of Assyria 
departed, and went, and returned, and 
dwelt at Nineveh. 38And it came to 
pass, as he was worshipping in the 
house of Nisroch his god, that 
Adrammelech and Sarezer his sons 
smote him with the sword; and they 
escaped into the land of Ararat. And 
Esarhaddon his son reigned in his 
stead. 

In those days was Hezekiah 
sick unto death. And Isaiah the 
prophet the son of Amoz came to him, 
and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the 
LORD: Set thy house in order; for thou 
shalt die, and not live.’ 2Then 
Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, 
and prayed unto the LORD, 3and said: 
‘Remember now, O LORD, I beseech 
Thee, how I have walked before Thee 
in truth and with a whole heart, and 
have done that which is good in Thy 
sight.’ And Hezekiah wept sore. 4Then 
came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, 
saying: 5’Go, and say to Hezekiah: 
Thus saith the LORD, the God of David 
thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I 
have seen thy tears; behold, I will add 
unto thy days fifteen years. 6And I will 
deliver thee and this city out of the 
hand of the king of Assyria; and I will 
defend this city. 7And this shall be the 
sign unto thee from the LORD, that the 
LORD will do this thing that He hath 
spoken: 8behold, I will cause the 
shadow of the dial, which is gone 
down on the sun-dial of Ahaz, to 
return backward ten degrees.’ So the 
sun returned ten degrees, by which 
degrees it was gone down. 

 

9The writing of Hezekiah king of 
Judah, when he had been sick, and was 
recovered of his sickness. 

10I said: In the noontide of my days I 
shall go, 

Even to the gates of the nether-
world; 

I am deprived of the residue of my 
years. 

11I said: I shall not see the LORD, 

Even the LORD in the land of the 
living; 

I shall behold man no more with the 
inhabitants of the world. 

12My habitation is plucked up and 
carried away from me 

As a shepherd’s tent; 

I have rolled up like a weaver my 
life; 

He will cut me off from the thrum; 

From day even to night wilt Thou 
make an end of me. 

13The more I make myself like unto 
a lion until morning, 

The more it breaketh all my bones; 

From day even to night wilt Thou 
make an end of me. 

14Like a swallow or a crane, so do I 
chatter, 

I do moan as a dove; 

Mine eyes fail with looking upward. 

O LORD, I am oppressed, be Thou 
my surety. 

 
38 




15What shall I say? He hath both 
spoken unto me, 

And Himself hath done it; 

I shall go softly all my years for the 
bitterness of my soul. 

16O Lord, by these things men live, 

And altogether therein is the life of 
my spirit; 

Wherefore recover Thou me, and 
make me to live. 

17Behold, for my peace I had great 
bitterness; 

But Thou hast in love to my soul 
delivered it 

From the pit of corruption; 

For Thou hast cast all my sins 
behind Thy back. 

 

18For the nether-world cannot praise 
Thee, 

Death cannot celebrate Thee; 

They that go down into the pit 
cannot hope for Thy truth. 

19The living, the living, he shall 
praise Thee, 

As I do this day; 

The father to the children shall make 
known Thy truth. 

20The LORD is ready to save me; 

Therefore we will sing songs to the 
stringed instruments 

All the days of our life in the house 
of the LORD. 

 

21And Isaiah said: ‘Let them take a 
cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster 
upon the boil, and he shall recover.’ 
22And Hezekiah said.’ What is the sign 
that I shall go up to the house of the 
LORD?’ 

At that time Merodach-
baladan the son of Baladan, 
king of Babylon, sent a letter and a 
present to Hezekiah; for he heard that 
he had been sick, and was recovered. 
2And Hezekiah was glad of them, and 
showed them his treasure-house, the 
silver, and the gold, and the spices, 
and the precious oil, and all the house 
of his armour, and all that was found 
in his treasures; there was nothing in 
his house, nor in all his dominion, that 
Hezekiah showed them not. 3Then 
came Isaiah the prophet unto king 
Hezekiah, and said unto him: ‘What 
said these men? and from whence 
came they unto thee?’ And Hezekiah 
said: ‘They are come from a far 
country unto me, even from Babylon.’ 
4Then said he: ‘What have they seen in 
thy house?’ And Hezekiah answered: 
‘All that is in my house have they 
seen; there is nothing among my 
treasures that I have not shown them.’ 
5Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah: ‘Hear 
the word of the LORD of hosts: 
6Behold, the days come, that all that is 
in thy house, and that which thy 
fathers have laid up in store until this 
day, shall be carried to Babylon; 
nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. 
7And of thy sons that shall issue from 
thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they 
take away; and they shall be officers in 
the palace of the king of Babylon.’ 
8Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah: 
‘Good is the word of the LORD which 
39 




thou hast spoken.’ He said moreover: 
‘If but there shall be peace and truth in 
my days.’ 

 

Comfort ye, comfort ye My 
people, 

Saith your God. 

2Bid Jerusalem take heart, 

And proclaim unto her, 

That her time of service is 
accomplished, 

That her guilt is paid off; 

That she hath received of the 
LORD’S hand 

Double for all her sins. 

 

3Hark! one calleth: 

‘Clear ye in the wilderness the way 
of the LORD, 

Make plain in the desert 

A highway for our God. 

4Every valley shall be lifted up, 

And every mountain and hill shall 
be made low; 

And the rugged shall be made level, 

And the rough places a plain; 

5And the glory of the LORD shall be 
revealed, 

And all flesh shall see it together; 

For the mouth of the LORD hath 
spoken it.’ 

 

6Hark! one saith: ‘Proclaim! ’ 

And he saith: ‘What shall I 
proclaim?’ 

’All flesh is grass, 

And all the goodliness thereof is as 
the flower of the field; 

7The grass withereth, the flower 
fadeth; 

Because the breath of the LORD 
bloweth upon it— 

Surely the people is grass. 

8The grass withereth, the flower 
fadeth; 

But the word of our God shall stand 
for ever.’ 

 

9O thou that tellest good tidings to 
Zion, 

Get thee up into the high mountain; 

O thou that tellest good tidings to 
Jerusalem, 

Lift up thy voice with strength; 

Lift it up, be not afraid; 

Say unto the cities of Judah: 

‘Behold your God! ’ 

10Behold, the Lord GOD will come as 
a Mighty One, 

And His arm will rule for Him; 

Behold, His reward is with Him, 

And His recompense before Him. 

11Even as a shepherd that feedeth his 
flock, 

That gathereth the lambs in his arm, 

And carrieth them in his bosom, 

And gently leadeth those that give 
suck. 

 

12Who hath measured the waters in 
the hollow of his hand, 

And meted out heaven with the 
span, 

And comprehended the dust of the 
earth in a measure, 

And weighed the mountains in 
scales, 
40 




And the hills in a balance? 

13Who hath meted out the spirit of 
the LORD? 

Or who was His counsellor that he 
might instruct Him? 

14With whom took He counsel, and 
who instructed Him, 

And taught Him in the path of right, 

And taught Him knowledge, 

And made Him to know the way of 
discernment? 

15Behold, the nations are as a drop 
of a bucket, 

And are counted as the small dust of 
the balance; 

Behold the isles are as a mote in 
weight. 

16And Lebanon is not sufficient fuel, 

Nor the beasts thereof sufficient for 
burnt-offerings. 

17All the nations are as nothing 
before Him; 

They are accounted by Him as 
things of nought, and vanity. 

18To whom then will ye liken God? 

Or what likeness will ye compare 
unto Him? 

19The image perchance, which the 
craftsman hath melted, 

And the goldsmith spread over with 
gold, 

The silversmith casting silver 
chains? 

20A holm-oak is set apart, 

He chooseth a tree that will not rot; 

He seeketh unto him a cunning 
craftsman 

To set up an image, that shall not be 
moved. 

 

21Know ye not? hear ye not? 

Hath it not been told you from the 
beginning? 

Have ye not understood the 
foundations of the earth? 

22It is He that sitteth above the circle 
of the earth, 

And the inhabitants thereof are as 
grasshoppers; 

That stretcheth out the heavens as a 
curtain, 

And spreadeth them out as a tent to 
dwell in; 

23That bringeth princes to nothing; 

He maketh the judges of the earth as 
a thing of nought. 

24Scarce are they planted, 

Scarce are they sown, 

Scarce hath their stock taken root in 
the earth; 

When He bloweth upon them, they 
wither, 

And the whirlwind taketh them 
away as stubble. 

25To whom then will ye liken Me, 
that I should be equal? 

Saith the Holy One. 

26Lift up your eyes on high, 

And see: who hath created these? 

He that bringeth out their host by 
number, 

He calleth them all by name; 

By the greatness of His might, and 
for that He is strong in power, 

Not one faileth. 

 

27Why sayest thou, O Jacob, 

And speakest, O Israel: 


‘My way is hid from the LORD, 

And my right is passed over from 
my God’? 

28Hast thou not known? hast thou 
not heard 

That the everlasting God, the LORD, 

The Creator of the ends of the earth, 

Fainteth not, neither is weary? 

His discernment is past searching 
out. 

29He giveth power to the faint; 

And to him that hath no might He 
increaseth strength. 

30Even the youths shall faint and be 
weary, 

And the young men shall utterly 
fall; 

31But they that wait for the LORD 
shall renew their strength; 

They shall mount up with wings as 
eagles; 

They shall run, and not be weary; 

They shall walk, and not faint. 

 

Keep silence before Me, O 
islands, 

And let the peoples renew their 
strength; 

Let them draw near, then let them 
speak; 

Let us come near together to 
judgment. 

2Who hath raised up one from the 
east, 

At whose steps victory attendeth? 

He giveth nations before him, 

And maketh him rule over kings; 

His sword maketh them as the dust, 

His bow as the driven stubble. 

3He pursueth them, and passeth on 
safely; 

The way with his feet he treadeth 
not. 

4Who hath wrought and done it? 

He that called the generations from 
the beginning. 

I, the LORD, who am the first, 

And with the last am the same. 

5The isles saw, and feared; 

The ends of the earth trembled; 

They drew near, and came. 

 

6They helped every one his 
neighbour; 

And every one said to his brother: 

‘Be of good courage.’ 

7So the carpenter encouraged the 
goldsmith, 

And he that smootheth with the 
hammer him that smiteth the 
anvil, 

Saying of the soldering: ‘It is good’; 

And he fastened it with nails, that it 
should not be moved. 

 

8But thou, Israel, My servant, 

Jacob whom I have chosen, 

The seed of Abraham My friend; 

9Thou whom I have taken hold of 
from the ends of the earth, 

And called thee from the uttermost 
parts thereof, 

And said unto thee: ‘Thou art My 
servant, 

I have chosen thee and not cast thee 
away’; 

10Fear thou not, for I am with thee, 

Be not dismayed, for I am thy God; 
41 




I strengthen thee, yea, I help thee; 

Yea, I uphold thee with My 
victorious right hand. 

11Behold, all they that were incensed 
against thee 

Shall be ashamed and confounded; 

They that strove with thee 

Shall be as nothing, and shall perish. 

12Thou shalt seek them, and shalt 
not find them, 

Even them that contended with thee; 

They that warred against thee 

Shall be as nothing, and as a thing 
of nought. 

13For I the LORD thy God 

Hold thy right hand, 

Who say unto thee: ‘Fear not, 

I help thee.’ 

 

14Fear not, thou worm Jacob, 

And ye men of Israel; 

I help thee, saith the LORD, 

And thy Redeemer, the Holy One of 
Israel. 

15Behold, I make thee a new 
threshing-sledge 

Having sharp teeth; 

Thou shalt thresh the mountains, 
and beat them small, 

And shalt make the hills as chaff. 

16Thou shalt fan them, and the wind 
shall carry them away, 

And the whirlwind shall scatter 
them; 

And thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, 

Thou shalt glory in the Holy One of 
Israel. 

 

17The poor and needy seek water 
and there is none, 

And their tongue faileth for thirst; 

I the LORD will answer them, 

I the God of Israel will not forsake 
them. 

18I will open rivers on the high hills, 

And fountains in the midst of the 
valleys; 

I will make the wilderness a pool of 
water, 

And the dry land springs of water. 

19I will plant in the wilderness the 
cedar, the acacia-tree, 

And the myrtle, and the oil-tree; 

I will set in the desert the cypress, 
the plane-tree, and the larch 
together; 

20That they may see, and know, 

And consider, and understand 
together, 

That the hand of the LORD hath done 
this, 

And the Holy One of Israel hath 
created it. 

 

21Produce your cause, saith the 
LORD; 

Bring forth your reasons, saith the 
King of Jacob. 

22Let them bring them forth, and 
declare unto us 

The things that shall happen; 

The former things, what are they? 

Declare ye, that we may consider, 

And know the end of them; 

Or announce to us things to come. 

23Declare the things that are to come 
hereafter, 


That we may know that ye are gods; 

Yea, do good, or do evil, 

That we may be dismayed, and 
behold it together. 

24Behold, ye are nothing, 

And your work a thing of nought; 

An abomination is he that chooseth 
you. 

 

25I have roused up one from the 
north, and he is come, 

From the rising of the sun one that 
calleth upon My name; 

And he shall come upon rulers as 
upon mortar, 

And as the potter treadeth clay. 

26Who hath declared from the 
beginning, that we may know? 

And beforetime, that we may say 
that he is right? 

Yea, there is none that declareth, 

Yea, there is none that announceth, 

Yea, there is none that heareth your 
utterances. 

27A harbinger unto Zion will I give: 
‘Behold, behold them’, 

And to Jerusalem a messenger of 
good tidings. 

28And I look, but there is no man; 

Even among them, but there is no 
counsellor, 

That, when I ask of them, can give 
an answer. 

29Behold, all of them, 

Their works are vanity and nought; 

Their molten images are wind and 
confusion. 

 

Behold My servant, whom I 
uphold; 

Mine elect, in whom My soul 
delighteth; 

I have put My spirit upon him, 

He shall make the right to go forth 
to the nations. 

2He shall not cry, nor lift up, 

Nor cause his voice to be heard in 
the street. 

3A bruised reed shall he not break, 

And the dimly burning wick shall he 
not quench; 

He shall make the right to go forth 
according to the truth. 

4He shall not fail nor be crushed, 

Till he have set the right in the 
earth; 

And the isles shall wait for his 
teaching. 

5Thus saith God the LORD, 

He that created the heavens, and 
stretched them forth, 

He that spread forth the earth and 
that which cometh out of it, 

He that giveth breath unto the 
people upon it, 

And spirit to them that walk therein: 

6I the LORD have called thee in 
righteousness, 

And have taken hold of thy hand, 

And kept thee, and set thee for a 
covenant of the people, 

For a light of the nations; 

7To open the blind eyes, 

To bring out the prisoners from the 
dungeon, 

And them that sit in darkness out of 
the prison-house. 
42 




8I am the LORD, that is My name; 

And My glory will I not give to 
another, 

Neither My praise to graven images. 

9Behold, the former things are come 
to pass, 

And new things do I declare; 

Before they spring forth I tell you of 
them. 

10Sing unto the LORD a new song, 

And His praise from the end of the 
earth; 

Ye that go down to the sea, and all 
that is therein, 

The isles, and the inhabitants 
thereof. 

11Let the wilderness and the cities 
thereof lift up their voice, 

The villages that Kedar doth inhabit; 

Let the inhabitants of Sela exult, 

Let them shout from the top of the 
mountains. 

12Let them give glory unto the LORD, 

And declare His praise in the 
islands. 

13The LORD will go forth as a mighty 
man, 

He will stir up jealousy like a man 
of war; 

He will cry, yea, He will shout 
aloud, 

He will prove Himself mighty 
against His enemies. 

 

14I have long time held My peace, 

I have been still, and refrained 
Myself; 

Now will I cry like a travailing 
woman, 

Gasping and panting at once. 

15I will make waste mountains and 
hills, 

And dry up all their herbs; 

And I will make the rivers islands, 

And will dry up the pools. 

16And I will bring the blind by a 
way that they knew not, 

In paths that they knew not will I 
lead them; 

I will make darkness light before 
them, and rugged places plain. 

These things will I do, 

And I will not leave them undone. 

17They shall be turned back, greatly 
ashamed, 

That trust in graven images, 

That say unto molten images: 

‘Ye are our gods.’ 

 

18Hear, ye deaf, 

And look, ye blind, that ye may see. 

19Who is blind, but My servant? 

Or deaf, as My messenger that I 
send? 

Who is blind as he that is 
wholehearted, 

And blind as the LORD’S servant? 

20Seeing many things, thou 
observest not; 

Opening the ears, he heareth not. 

21The LORD was pleased, for His 
righteousness’sake, 

To make the teaching great and 
glorious. 

22But this is a people robbed and 
spoiled, 

They are all of them snared in holes, 

And they are hid in prison-houses; 


They are for a prey, and none 
delivereth, 

For a spoil, and none saith: 
‘Restore.’ 

23Who among you will give ear to 
this? Who will hearken and hear 
for the time to come? 

24Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and 
Israel to the robbers? 

Did not the LORD? 

He against whom we have sinned, 

And in whose ways they would not 
walk, 

Neither were they obedient unto His 
law. 

25Therefore He poured upon him the 
fury of His anger, 

And the strength of battle; 

And it set him on fire round about, 
yet he knew not, 

And it burned him, yet he laid it not 
to heart. 

 

But now thus saith the LORD 
that created thee, O Jacob, 

And He that formed thee, O Israel: 

Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, 

I have called thee by thy name, thou 
art Mine. 

2When thou passest through the 
waters, I will be with thee, 

And through the rivers, they shall 
not overflow thee; 

When thou walkest through the fire, 
thou shalt not be burned, 

Neither shall the flame kindle upon 
thee. 

3For I am the LORD thy God, 

The Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour; 

I have given Egypt as thy ransom, 

Ethiopia and Seba for thee. 

4Since thou art precious in My sight, 
and honourable, 

And I have loved thee; 

Therefore will I give men for thee, 

And peoples for thy life. 

5Fear not, for I am with thee; 

I will bring thy seed from the east, 

And gather thee from the west; 

6I will say to the north: ‘Give up’, 

And to the south: ‘Keep not back, 

Bring My sons from far, 

And My daughters from the end of 
the earth; 

7Every one that is called by My 
name, 

And whom I have created for My 
glory, 

I have formed him, yea, I have made 
him.’ 

8The blind people that have eyes 
shall be brought forth, 

And the deaf that have ears. 

9All the nations are gathered 
together, 

And the peoples are assembled; 

Who among them can declare this, 

And announce to us former things? 

Let them bring their witnesses, that 
they may be justified; 

And let them hear, and say: ‘It is 
truth.’ 

10Ye are My witnesses, saith the 
LORD, 

And My servant whom I have 
chosen; 

That ye may know and believe Me, 
and understand 
43 




That I am He; 

Before Me there was no God 
formed, 

Neither shall any be after Me. 

 

11I, even I, am the LORD; 

And beside Me there is no saviour. 

12I have declared, and I have saved, 

And I have announced, 

And there was no strange god 
among you; 

Therefore ye are My witnesses, saith 
the LORD, and I am God. 

13Yea, since the day was I am He, 

And there is none that can deliver 
out of My hand; 

I will work, and who can reverse it? 

 

14Thus saith the LORD, your 
Redeemer, 

The Holy One of Israel: 

For your sake I have sent to 
Babylon, 

And I will bring down all of them as 
fugitives, 

Even the Chaldeans, in the ships of 
their shouting. 

15I am the LORD, your Holy One, 

The Creator of Israel, your King. 

 

16Thus saith the LORD, who maketh a 
way in the sea, 

And a path in the mighty waters; 

17Who bringeth forth the chariot and 
horse, 

The army and the power— 

They lie down together, they shall 
not rise, 

They are extinct, they are quenched 
as a wick: 

18Remember ye not the former 
things, 

Neither consider the things of old. 

19Behold, I will do a new thing; 

Now shall it spring forth; shall ye 
not know it? 

I will even make a way in the 
wilderness, 

And rivers in the desert. 

20The beasts of the field shall 
honour Me, 

The jackals and the ostriches; 

Because I give waters in the 
wilderness, 

And rivers in the desert, 

To give drink to My people, Mine 
elect; 

21The people which I formed for 
Myself, 

That they might tell of My praise. 

 

22Yet thou hast not called upon Me, 
O Jacob, 

Neither hast thou wearied thyself 
about Me, O Israel. 

23Thou hast not brought Me the 
small cattle of thy burnt-
offerings; 

Neither hast thou honoured Me with 
thy sacrifices. 

I have not burdened thee with a 
meal-offering, 

Nor wearied thee with frankincense. 

24Thou hast bought Me no sweet 
cane with money, 

Neither hast thou satisfied Me with 
the fat of thy sacrifices; 


But thou hast burdened Me with thy 
sins, 

Thou hast wearied Me with thine 
iniquities. 

25I, even I, am He that blotteth out 
thy transgressions for Mine own 
sake; 

And thy sins I will not remember. 

26Put Me in remembrance, let us 
plead together; 

Declare thou, that thou mayest be 
justified. 

27Thy first father sinned, 

And thine intercessors have 
transgressed against Me. 

28Therefore I have profaned the 
princes of the sanctuary, 

And I have given Jacob to 
condemnation, 

And Israel to reviling. 

 

Yet now hear, O Jacob My 
servant, 

And Israel, whom I have chosen; 

2Thus saith the LORD that made thee, 

And formed thee from the womb, 
who will help thee: 

Fear not, O Jacob My servant, 

And thou, Jeshurun, whom I have 
chosen. 

3For I will pour water upon the 
thirsty land, 

And streams upon the dry ground; 

I will pour My spirit upon thy seed, 

And My blessing upon thine 
offspring; 

4And they shall spring up among the 
grass, 

As willows by the watercourses. 

5One shall say: ‘I am the LORD’S’; 

And another shall call himself by 
the name of Jacob; 

And another shall subscribe with his 
hand unto the LORD, 

And surname himself by the name 
of Israel. 

 

6Thus saith the LORD, the King of 
Israel, 

And his Redeemer the LORD of 
hosts: 

I am the first, and I am the last, 

And beside Me there is no God. 

7And who, as I, can proclaim— 

Let him declare it, and set it in order 
for Me— 

Since I appointed the ancient 
people? 

And the things that are coming, and 
that shall come to pass, let them 
declare. 

8Fear ye not, neither be afraid; 

Have I not announced unto thee of 
old, and declared it? 

And ye are My witnesses. 

Is there a God beside Me? 

Yea, there is no Rock; I know not 
any. 

 

9They that fashion a graven image 
are all of them vanity, 

And their delectable things shall not 
profit; 

And their own witnesses see not, 
nor know; 

That they may be ashamed. 

10Who hath fashioned a god, or 
molten an image 
44 




That is profitable for nothing? 

11Behold, all the fellows thereof 
shall be ashamed; 

And the craftsmen skilled above 
men; 

Let them all be gathered together, 
let them stand up; 

They shall fear, they shall be 
ashamed together. 

 

12The smith maketh an axe, 

And worketh in the coals, and 
fashioneth it with hammers, 

And worketh it with his strong arm; 

Yea, he is hungry, and his strength 
faileth; 

He drinketh no water, and is faint. 

13The carpenter stretcheth out a line; 

He marketh it out with a pencil; 

He fitteth it with planes, 

And he marketh it out with the 
compasses, 

And maketh it after the figure of a 
man, 

According to the beauty of a man, to 
dwell in the house. 

14He heweth him down cedars, 

And taketh the ilex and the oak, 

And strengtheneth for himself one 
among the trees of the forest; 

He planteth a bay-tree, and the rain 
doth nourish it. 

15Then a man useth it for fuel; 

And he taketh thereof, and warmeth 
himself; 

Yea, he kindleth it, and baketh 
bread; 

Yea, he maketh a god, and 
worshippeth it; 

He maketh it a graven image, and 
falleth down thereto. 

16He burneth the half thereof in the 
fire; 

With the half thereof he eateth flesh; 

He roasteth roast, and is satisfied; 

Yea, he warmeth himself, and saith: 
‘Aha, 

I am warm, I have seen the fire’; 

17And the residue thereof he maketh 
a god, even his graven image; 

He falleth down unto it and 
worshippeth, and prayeth unto it, 

And saith: ‘Deliver me, for thou art 
my god.’ 

 

18They know not, neither do they 
understand; 

For their eyes are bedaubed, that 
they cannot see, 

And their hearts, that they cannot 
understand. 

19And none considereth in his heart, 

Neither is there knowledge nor 
understanding to say: 

‘I have burned the half of it in the 
fire; 

Yea, also I have baked bread upon 
the coals thereof; 

I have roasted flesh and eaten it; 

And shall I make the residue thereof 
an abomination? 

Shall I fall down to the stock of a 
tree?’ 

20He striveth after ashes, 

A deceived heart hath turned him 
aside, 

That he cannot deliver his soul, nor 
say: 


‘Is there not a lie in my right hand?’ 

 

21Remember these things, O Jacob, 

And Israel, for thou art My servant; 

I have formed thee, thou art Mine 
own servant; 

O Israel, thou shouldest not forget 
Me. 

22I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, 
thy transgressions, 

And, as a cloud, thy sins; 

Return unto Me, for I have 
redeemed thee. 

23Sing, O ye heavens, for the LORD 
hath done it; 

Shout, ye lowest parts of the earth; 

Break forth into singing, ye 
mountains, 

O forest, and every tree therein; 

For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, 

And doth glorify Himself in Israel. 

 

24Thus saith the LORD, thy 
Redeemer, 

And He that formed thee from the 
womb: 

I am the LORD, that maketh all 
things; 

That stretched forth the heavens 
alone; 

That spread abroad the earth by 
Myself; 

25That frustrateth the tokens of the 
imposters, 

And maketh diviners mad; 

That turneth wise men backward, 

And maketh their knowledge 
foolish; 

26That confirmeth the word of His 
servant, 

And performeth the counsel of His 
messengers; 

That saith of Jerusalem: ‘She shall 
be inhabited’; 

And of the cities of Judah: ‘They 
shall be built, 

And I will raise up the waste places 
thereof’; 

27That saith to the deep: ‘Be dry, 
and I will dry up thy rivers’; 

28That saith of Cyrus: ‘He is My 
shepherd, 

And shall perform all My pleasure’; 

Even saying of Jerusalem: ‘She 
shall be built’; 

And to the temple: ‘My foundation 
shall be laid.’ 

 

Thus saith the LORD to His 
anointed, 

To Cyrus, whose right hand I have 
holden, 

To subdue nations before him, 

And to loose the loins of kings; 

To open the doors before him, 

And that the gates may not be shut: 

2I will go before thee, 

And make the crooked places 
straight; 

I will break in pieces the doors of 
brass, 

And cut in sunder the bars of iron; 

3And I will give thee the treasures of 
darkness, 

And hidden riches of secret places, 

That thou mayest know that I am the 
LORD, 
45 




Who call thee by thy name, even the 
God of Israel. 

4For the sake of Jacob My servant, 

And Israel Mine elect, 

I have called thee by thy name, 

I have surnamed thee, though thou 
hast not known Me. 

5I am the LORD, and there is none 
else, 

Beside Me there is no God; 

I have girded thee, though thou hast 
not known Me; 

6That they may know from the 
rising of the sun, and from the 
west, 

That there is none beside Me; 

I am the LORD; and there is none 
else; 

7I form the light, and create 
darkness; 

I make peace, and create evil; 

I am the LORD, that doeth all these 
things. 

 

8Drop down, ye heavens, from 
above, 

And let the skies pour down 
righteousness; 

Let the earth open, that they may 
bring forth salvation, 

And let her cause righteousness to 
spring up together; 

I the LORD have created it. 

 

9Woe unto him that striveth with his 
Maker, 

As a potsherd with the potsherds of 
the earth! 

Shall the clay say to him that 
fashioned it: ‘What makest thou?’ 

Or: ‘Thy work, it hath no hands’? 

10Woe unto him that saith unto his 
father.’ Wherefore begettest 
thou?’ 

Or to a woman: ‘Wherefore 
travailest thou?’ 

 

11Thus saith the LORD, 

The Holy One of Israel, and his 
Maker: 

Ask Me of the things that are to 
come; 

Concerning My sons, and 
concerning the work of My 
hands, command ye Me. 

12I, even I, have made the earth, 

And created man upon it; 

I, even My hands, have stretched out 
the heavens, 

And all their host have I 
commanded. 

13I have roused him up in victory, 

And I make level all his ways; 

He shall build My city, 

And he shall let Mine exiles go free, 

Not for price nor reward, 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

 

14Thus saith the LORD: 

The labour of Egypt, and the 
merchandise of Ethiopia, 

And of the Sabeans, men of stature, 

Shall come over unto thee, and they 
shall be thine; 

They shall go after thee, in chains 
they shall come over; 

And they shall fall down unto thee, 


They shall make supplication unto 
thee: 

Surely God is in thee, and there is 
none else, 

There is no other God. 

15Verily Thou art a God that hidest 
Thyself, 

O God of Israel, the Saviour. 

16They shall be ashamed, yea, 
confounded, all of them; 

They shall go in confusion together 
that are makers of idols. 

17O Israel, that art saved by the LORD 
with an everlasting salvation; 

Ye shall not be ashamed nor 
confounded world without end. 

 

18For thus saith the LORD that created 
the heavens, 

He is God; 

That formed the earth and made it, 

He established it, 

He created it not a waste, He formed 
it to be inhabited: 

I am the LORD, and there is none 
else. 

19I have not spoken in secret, 

In a place of the land of darkness; 

I said not unto the seed of Jacob: 

‘Seek ye Me in vain’; 

I the LORD speak righteousness, 

I declare things that are right. 

20Assemble yourselves and come, 
draw near together, 

Ye that are escaped of the nations; 

They have no knowledge that carry 
the wood of their graven image, 

And pray unto a god that cannot 
save. 

21Declare ye, and bring them near, 

Yea, let them take counsel together: 

Who hath announced this from 
ancient time, 

And declared it of old? 

Have not I the LORD? 

And there is no God else beside Me, 

A just God and a Saviour; 

There is none beside Me. 

22Look unto Me, and be ye saved, 

All the ends of the earth; 

For I am God, and there is none 
else. 

23By Myself have I sworn, 

The word is gone forth from My 
mouth in righteousness, 

And shall not come back, 

That unto Me every knee shall bow, 

Every tongue shall swear. 

24Only in the LORD, shall one say of 
Me, is victory and strength; 

Even to Him shall men come in 
confusion, 

All they that were incensed against 
Him. 

25In the LORD shall all the seed of 
Israel 

Be justified, and shall glory. 

 

Bel boweth down, Nebo 
stoopeth; 

Their idols are upon the beasts, and 
upon the cattle; 

The things that ye carried about are 
made a load, 

A burden to the weary beast. 

2They stoop, they bow down 
together, 

They could not deliver the burden; 
46 




And themselves are gone into 
captivity. 

3Hearken unto Me, O house of 
Jacob, 

And all the remnant of the house of 
Israel, 

That are borne [by Me] from the 
birth, 

That are carried from the womb: 

4Even to old age I am the same, 

And even to hoar hairs will I carry 
you; 

I have made, and I will bear; 

Yea, I will carry, and will deliver. 

 

5To whom will ye liken Me, and 
make Me equal, 

And compare Me, that we may be 
like? 

6Ye that lavish gold out of the bag, 

And weigh silver in the balance; 

Ye that hire a goldsmith, that he 
make it a god, 

To fall down thereto, yea, to 
worship. 

7He is borne upon the shoulder, he is 
carried, 

And set in his place, and he 
standeth, 

From his place he doth not remove; 

Yea, though one cry unto him, he 
cannot answer, 

Nor save him out of his trouble. 

 

8Remember this, and stand fast; 

Bring it to mind, O ye transgressors. 

9Remember the former things of 
old: 

That I am God, and there is none 
else; 

I am God, and there is none like Me; 

10Declaring the end from the 
beginning, 

And from ancient times things that 
are not yet done; 

Saying: ‘My counsel shall stand, 

And all My pleasure will I do’; 

11Calling a bird of prey from the 
east, 

The man of My counsel from a far 
country; 

Yea, I have spoken, I will also bring 
it to pass, 

I have purposed, I will also do it. 

 

12Hearken unto Me, ye stout-
hearted, 

That are far from righteousness: 

13I bring near My righteousness, it 
shall not be far off, 

And My salvation shall not tarry; 

And I will place salvation in Zion 

For Israel My glory. 

 

Come down, and sit in the 
dust, 

O virgin daughter of Babylon, 

Sit on the ground without a throne, 

O daughter of the Chaldeans; 

For thou shalt no more be called 

Tender and delicate. 

2Take the millstones, and grind 
meal; 

Remove thy veil, 

Strip off the train, uncover the leg, 

Pass through the rivers. 

3Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, 
47 




Yea, thy shame shall be seen; 

I will take vengeance, 

And will let no man intercede. 

4Our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is 
His name, 

The Holy One of Israel. 

5Sit thou silent, and get thee into 
darkness, 

O daughter of the Chaldeans; 

For thou shalt no more be called 

The mistress of kingdoms. 

6I was wroth with My people, 

I profaned Mine inheritance, 

And gave them into thy hand; 

Thou didst show them no mercy; 

Upon the aged hast thou very 
heavily 

Laid thy yoke. 

7And thou saidst: 

‘For ever shall I be mistress’; 

So that thou didst not lay these 
things to thy heart, 

Neither didst remember the end 
thereof. 

 

8Now therefore hear this, thou that 
art given to pleasures, 

That sittest securely, 

That sayest in thy heart: 

‘I am, and there is none else beside 
me; 

I shall not sit as a widow, 

Neither shall I know the loss of 
children’; 

9But these two things shall come to 
thee in a moment 

In one day, the loss of children, and 
widow-hood; 

In their full measure shall they come 
upon thee, 

For the multitude of thy sorceries, 

And the great abundance of thine 
enchantments. 

 

10And thou hast been secure in thy 
wickedness, 

Thou hast said: ‘None seeth me’; 

Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, 

It hath perverted thee; 

And thou hast said in thy heart. 

’I am, and there is none else beside 
me.’ 

11Yet shall evil came upon thee; 

Thou shalt not know how to charm 
it away; 

And calamity shall fall upon thee; 

Thou shalt not be able to put it 
away; 

And ruin shall come upon thee 
suddenly, 

Before thou knowest. 

 

12Stand now with thine 
enchantments, 

And with the multitude of thy 
sorceries, 

Wherein thou hast laboured from 
thy youth; 

If so be thou shalt be able to profit, 

If so be thou mayest prevail. 

13Thou art wearied in the multitude 
of thy counsels; 

Let now the astrologers, the 
stargazers, 

The monthly prognosticators, 

Stand up, and save thee 


From the things that shall come 
upon thee. 

14Behold, they shall be as stubble; 

The fire shall burn them; 

They shall not deliver themselves 

From the power of the flame; 

It shall not be a coal to warm at, 

Nor a fire to sit before. 

15Thus shall they be unto thee 

With whom thou hast laboured; 

They that have trafficked with thee 
from thy youth 

Shall wander every one to his 
quarter; 

There shall be none to save thee. 

 

Hear ye this, O house of 
Jacob, 

Who are called by the name of 
Israel, 

And are come forth out of the 
fountain of Judah; 

Who swear by the name of the 
LORD, 

And make mention of the God of 
Israel, 

But not in truth, nor in 
righteousness. 

2For they call themselves of the holy 
city, 

And stay themselves upon the God 
of Israel, 

The LORD of hosts is His name. 

3I have declared the former things 
from of old; 

Yea, they went forth out of My 
mouth, and I announced them; 

Suddenly I did them, and they came 
to pass. 

4Because I knew that thou art 
obstinate, 

And thy neck is an iron sinew, and 
thy brow brass; 

5Therefore I have declared it to thee 
from of old; 

Before it came to pass I announced 
it to thee; 

Lest thou shouldest say: ‘Mine idol 
hath done them, 

And my graven image, and my 
molten image, hath commanded 
them.’ 

6Thou hast heard, see, all this; 

And ye, will ye not declare it? 

I have announced unto thee new 
things from this time, 

Even hidden things, which thou hast 
not known. 

7They are created now, and not from 
of old, 

And before this day thou heardest 
them not; 

Lest thou shouldest say: ‘Behold, I 
knew them.’ 

8Yea, thou heardest not; 

Yea, thou knewest not; 

Yea, from of old thine ear was not 
opened; 

For I knew that thou wouldest deal 
very treacherously, 

And wast called a transgressor from 
the womb. 

9For My name’s sake will I defer 
Mine anger, 

And for My praise will I refrain for 
thee, that I cut thee not off. 

10Behold, I have refined thee, but 
not as silver; 
48 




I have tried thee in the furnace of 
affliction. 

11For Mine own sake, for Mine own 
sake, will I do it; 

For how should it be profaned? 

And My glory will I not give to 
another. 

 

12Hearken unto Me, O Jacob, 

And Israel My called: 

I am He; I am the first, 

I also am the last. 

13Yea, My hand hath laid the 
foundation of the earth, 

And My right hand hath spread out 
the heavens; 

When I call unto them, 

They stand up together. 

14Assemble yourselves, all ye, and 
hear; 

Which among them hath declared 
these things? 

He whom the LORD loveth shall 
perform His pleasure on Babylon, 

And show His arm on the 
Chaldeans. 

15I, even I, have spoken, yea, I have 
called him; 

I have brought him, and he shall 
make his way prosperous. 

 

16Come ye near unto Me, hear ye 
this: 

From the beginning I have not 
spoken in secret; 

From the time that it was, there am 
I; 

And now the Lord GOD hath sent 
me, and His spirit. 

 

17Thus saith the LORD, thy 
Redeemer, 

The Holy One of Israel: 

I am the LORD thy God, 

Who teacheth thee for thy profit, 

Who leadeth thee by the way that 
thou shouldest go. 

18Oh that thou wouldest hearken to 
My commandments! 

Then would thy peace be as a river, 

And thy righteousness as the waves 
of the sea; 

19Thy seed also would be as the 
sand, 

And the offspring of thy body like 
the grains thereof; 

His name would not be cut off 

Nor destroyed from before Me. 

 

20Go ye forth from Babylon, 

Flee ye from the Chaldeans; 

With a voice of singing 

Declare ye, tell this, 

Utter it even to the end of the earth; 

Say ye: ‘The LORD hath redeemed 
His servant Jacob. 

21And they thirsted not 

When He led them through the 
deserts; 

He caused the waters to flow out of 
the rock for them; 

He cleaved the rock also, and the 
waters gushed out.’ 

22There is no peace, 

Saith the LORD concerning the 
wicked. 

 


Listen, O isles, unto me, 

And hearken, ye peoples, from 
far: 

The LORD hath called me from the 
womb, 

From the bowels of my mother hath 
He made mention of my name; 

2And He hath made my mouth like a 
sharp sword, 

In the shadow of His hand hath He 
hid me; 

And He hath made me a polished 
shaft, 

In His quiver hath He concealed me; 

3And He said unto me: ‘Thou art 
My servant, 

Israel, in whom I will be glorified.’ 

4But I said: ‘I have laboured in vain, 

I have spent my strength for nought 
and vanity; 

Yet surely my right is with the 
LORD, 

And my recompense with my God.’ 

5And now saith the LORD 

That formed me from the womb to 
be His servant, 

To bring Jacob back to Him, 

And that Israel be gathered unto 
Him— 

For I am honourable in the eyes of 
the LORD, 

And my God is become my 
strength— 

6Yea, He saith: ‘It is too light a 
thing that thou shouldest be My 
servant 

To raise up the tribes of Jacob, 

And to restore the offspring of 
Israel; 

I will also give thee for a light of the 
nations, 

That My salvation may be unto the 
end of the earth.’ 

 

7Thus saith the LORD, 

The Redeemer of Israel, his Holy 
One, 

To him who is despised of men, 

To him who is abhorred of nations, 

To a servant of rulers: 

Kings shall see and arise, 

Princes, and they shall prostrate 
themselves; 

Because of the LORD that is faithful, 

Even the Holy One of Israel, who 
hath chosen thee. 

 

8Thus saith the LORD: 

In an acceptable time have I 
answered thee, 

And in a day of salvation have I 
helped thee; 

And I will preserve thee, and give 
thee 

For a covenant of the people, 

To raise up the land, 

To cause to inherit the desolate 
heritages; 

9Saying to the prisoners: ‘Go forth’; 

To them that are in darkness: ‘Show 
yourselves’; 

They shall feed in the ways, 

And in all high hills shall be their 
pasture; 

10They shall not hunger nor thirst, 

Neither shall the heat nor sun smite 
them; 
49 




For He that hath compassion on 
them will lead them, 

Even by the springs of water will He 
guide them. 

11And I will make all My mountains 
a way, 

And My highways shall be raised on 
high. 

12Behold, these shall come from far; 

And, lo, these from the north and 
from the west, 

And these from the land of Sinim. 

 

13Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O 
earth, 

And break forth into singing, O 
mountains; 

For the LORD hath comforted His 
people, 

And hath compassion upon His 
afflicted. 

 

14But Zion said: ‘The LORD hath 
forsaken me, 

And the Lord hath forgotten me.’ 

15Can a woman forget her sucking 
child, 

That she should not have 
compassion on the son of her 
womb? 

Yea, these may forget, 

Yet will not I forget thee. 

16Behold, I have graven thee upon 
the palms of My hands; 

Thy walls are continually before 
Me. 

17Thy children make haste; 

Thy destroyers and they that made 
thee waste shall go forth from 
thee. 

18Lift up thine eyes round about, and 
behold: 

All these gather themselves 
together, and come to thee. 

As I live, saith the LORD, 

Thou shalt surely clothe thee with 
them all as with an ornament, 

And gird thyself with them, like a 
bride. 

19For thy waste and thy desolate 
places 

And thy land that hath been 
destroyed— 

Surely now shalt thou be too strait 
for the inhabitants, 

And they that swallowed thee up 
shall be far away. 

20The children of thy bereavement 

Shall yet say in thine ears: 

‘The place is too strait for me; 

Give place to me that I may dwell.’ 

21Then shalt thou say in thy heart: 

‘Who hath begotten me these, 

Seeing I have been bereaved of my 
children, and am solitary, 

An exile, and wandering to and fro? 

And who hath brought up these? 

Behold, I was left alone; 

These, where were they?’ 

 

22Thus saith the Lord GOD: 

Behold, I will lift up My hand to the 
nations, 

And set up Mine ensign to the 
peoples, 


And they shall bring thy sons in 
their bosom, 

And thy daughters shall be carried 
upon their shoulders. 

23And kings shall be thy foster-
fathers, 

And their queens thy nursing 
mothers; 

They shall bow down to thee with 
their face to the earth, 

And lick the dust of thy feet; 

And thou shalt know that I am the 
LORD, 

For they shall not be ashamed that 
wait for Me. 

 

24Shall the prey be taken from the 
mighty, 

Or the captives of the victorious be 
delivered? 

25But thus saith the LORD: 

Even the captives of the mighty 
shall be taken away, 

And the prey of the terrible shall be 
delivered; 

And I will contend with him that 
contendeth with thee, 

And I will save thy children. 

26And I will feed them that oppress 
thee with their own flesh; 

And they shall be drunken with their 
own blood, as with sweet wine; 

And all flesh shall know that I the 
LORD am thy Saviour, 

And thy Redeemer, the Mighty One 
of Jacob. 

 

Thus saith the LORD: 

Where is the bill of your 
mother’s divorcement, 

Wherewith I have put her away? 

Or which of My creditors is it 

To whom I have sold you? 

Behold, for your iniquities were ye 
sold, 

And for your transgressions was 
your mother put away. 

2Wherefore, when I came, was there 
no man? 

When I called, was there none to 
answer? 

Is My hand shortened at all, that it 
cannot redeem? 

Or have I no power to deliver? 

Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the 
sea, 

I make the rivers a wilderness; 

Their fish become foul, because 
there is no water, 

And die for thirst. 

3I clothe the heavens with blackness, 

And I make sackcloth their 
covering. 

 

4The Lord GOD hath given me 

The tongue of them that are taught, 

That I should know how to sustain 
with words him that is weary; 

He wakeneth morning by morning, 

He wakeneth mine ear 

To hear as they that are taught. 

5The Lord GOD hath opened mine 
ear, 

And I was not rebellious, 

Neither turned away backward. 

6I gave my back to the smiters, 

And my checks to them that plucked 
off the hair; 50 




I hid not my face from shame and 
spitting. 

7For the Lord GOD will help me; 

Therefore have I not been 
confounded; 

Therefore have I set my face like a 
flint, 

And I know that I shall not be 
ashamed. 

8He is near that justifieth me; 

Who will contend with me? let us 
stand up together; 

Who is mine adversary? let him 
come near to me. 

9Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; 

Who is he that shall condemn me? 

Behold, they all shall wax old as a 
garment, 

The moth shall eat them up. 

 

10Who is among you that feareth the 
LORD, 

That obeyeth the voice of His 
servant? 

Though he walketh in darkness, 

And hath no light, 

Let him trust in the name of the 
LORD, 

And stay upon his God. 

11Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, 

That gird yourselves with 
firebrands, 

Begone in the flame of your fire, 

And among the brands that ye have 
kindled. 

This shall ye have of My hand; 

Ye shall lie down in sorrow. 

 

Hearken to Me, ye that follow 
after righteousness, 

Ye that seek the LORD; 

Look unto the rock whence ye were 
hewn, 

And to the hole of the pit whence ye 
were digged. 

2Look unto Abraham your father, 

And unto Sarah that bore you; 

For when he was but one I called 
him, 

And I blessed him, and made him 
many. 

3For the LORD hath comforted Zion; 

He hath comforted all her waste 
places, 

And hath made her wilderness like 
Eden, 

And her desert like the garden of the 
LORD; 

Joy and gladness shall be found 
therein, 

Thanksgiving, and the voice of 
melody. 

 

4Attend unto Me, O My people, 

And give ear unto Me, O My nation; 

For instruction shall go forth from 
Me, 

And My right on a sudden for a light 
of the peoples. 

5My favour is near, 

My salvation is gone forth, 

And Mine arms shall judge the 
peoples; 

The isles shall wait for Me, 

And on Mine arm shall they trust. 

6Lift up your eyes to the heavens, 

And look upon the earth beneath; 
51 




For the heavens shall vanish away 
like smoke, 

And the earth shall wax old like a 
garment, 

And they that dwell therein shall die 
in like manner; 

But My salvation shall be for ever, 

And My favour shall not be 
abolished. 

 

7Hearken unto Me, ye that know 
righteousness, 

The people in whose heart is My 
law; 

Fear ye not the taunt of men, 

Neither be ye dismayed at their 
revilings. 

8For the moth shall eat them up like 
a garment, 

And the worm shall eat them like 
wool; 

But My favour shall be for ever, 

And My salvation unto all 
generations. 

 

9Awake, awake, put on strength, 

O arm of the LORD; 

Awake, as in the days of old, 

The generations of ancient times. 

Art thou not it that hewed Rahab in 
pieces, 

That pierced the dragon? 

10Art thou not it that dried up the 
sea, 

The waters of the great deep; 

That made the depths of the sea a 
way 

For the redeemed to pass over? 

11And the ransomed of the LORD 
shall return, 

And come with singing unto Zion, 

And everlasting joy shall be upon 
their heads; 

They shall obtain gladness and joy, 

And sorrow and sighing shall flee 
away. 

 

12I, even I, am He that comforteth 
you: 

Who art thou, that thou art afraid of 
man that shall die, 

And of the son of man that shall be 
made as grass; 

13And hast forgotten the LORD thy 
Maker, 

That stretched forth the heavens, 

And laid the foundations of the 
earth; 

And fearest continually all the day 

Because of the fury of the 
oppressor, 

As he maketh ready to destroy? 

And where is the fury of the 
oppressor? 

14He that is bent down shall speedily 
be loosed; 

And he shall not go down dying into 
the pit, 

Neither shall his bread fail. 

15For I am the LORD thy God, 

Who stirreth up the sea, that the 
waves thereof roar; 

The LORD of hosts is His name. 

16And I have put My words in thy 
mouth, 

And have covered thee in the 
shadow of My hand, 


That I may plant the heavens, 

And lay the foundations of the earth, 

And say unto Zion: ‘Thou art My 
people.’ 

 

17Awake, awake, 

Stand up, O Jerusalem, 

That hast drunk at the hand of the 
LORD 

The cup of His fury; 

Thou hast drunken the beaker, even 
the cup of staggering, 

And drained it. 

18There is none to guide her 

Among all the sons whom she hath 
brought forth; 

Neither is there any that taketh her 
by the hand 

Of all the sons that she hath brought 
up. 

19These two things are befallen thee; 

Who shall bemoan thee? 

Desolation and destruction, 

And the famine and the sword; 

How shall I comfort thee? 

20Thy sons have fainted, they lie at 
the head of all the streets, 

As an antelope in a net; 

They are full of the fury of the LORD, 

The rebuke of thy God. 

21Therefore hear now this, thou 
afflicted, 

And drunken, but not with wine; 

22Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, 

And thy God that pleadeth the cause 
of His people: 

Behold, I have taken out of thy hand 

The cup of staggering; 

The beaker, even the cup of My 
fury, 

Thou shalt no more drink it again; 

23And I will put it into the hand of 
them that afflict thee; 

That have said to thy soul: 

‘Bow down, that we may go over’; 

And thou hast laid thy back as the 
ground, 

And as the street, to them that go 
over. 

 

Awake, awake, 

Put on thy strength, O Zion; 

Put on thy beautiful garments, 

O Jerusalem, the holy city; 

For henceforth there shall no more 
come into thee 

The uncircumcised and the unclean. 

2Shake thyself from the dust; 

Arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem; 

Loose thyself from the bands of thy 
neck, 

O captive daughter of Zion. 

 

3For thus saith the LORD: 

Ye were sold for nought; 

And ye shall be redeemed without 
money. 

4For thus saith the Lord GOD: 

My people went down aforetime 
into Egypt to sojourn there; 

And the Assyrian oppressed them 
without cause. 

5Now therefore, what do I here, 
saith the LORD, 

Seeing that My people is taken away 
for nought? 
52 




They that rule over them do howl, 
saith the LORD, 

And My name continually all the 
day is blasphemed. 

6Therefore My people shall know 
My name; 

Therefore they shall know in that 
day 

That I, even He that spoke, behold, 
here I am. 

 

7How beautiful upon the mountains 

Are the feet of the messenger of 
good tidings, 

That announceth peace, the 
harbinger of good tidings, 

That announceth salvation; 

That saith unto Zion: 

‘Thy God reigneth! ’ 

8Hark, thy watchmen! they lift up 
the voice, 

Together do they sing; 

For they shall see, eye to eye, 

The LORD returning to Zion. 

9Break forth into joy, sing together, 

Ye waste places of Jerusalem; 

For the LORD hath comforted His 
people, 

He hath redeemed Jerusalem. 

10The LORD hath made bare His holy 
arm 

In the eyes of all the nations; 

And all the ends of the earth shall 
see 

The salvation of our God. 

11Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out 
from thence, 

Touch no unclean thing; 

Go ye out of the midst of her; be ye 
clean, 

Ye that bear the vessels of the LORD. 

12For ye shall not go out in haste, 

Neither shall ye go by flight; 

For the LORD will go before you, 

And the God of Israel will be your 
rearward. 

 

13Behold, My servant shall prosper, 

He shall be exalted and lifted up, 
and shall be very high. 

14According as many were appalled 
at thee— 

So marred was his visage unlike that 
of a man, 

And his form unlike that of the sons 
of men— 

15So shall he startle many nations, 

Kings shall shut their mouths 
because of him; 

For that which had not been told 
them shall they see, 

And that which they had not heard 
shall they perceive. 

’Who would have believed our 
report? 

And to whom hath the arm of the 
LORD been revealed? 

2For he shot up right forth as a 
sapling, 

And as a root out of a dry ground; 

He had no form nor comeliness, that 
we should look upon him, 

Nor beauty that we should delight in 
him. 

3He was despised, and forsaken of 
men, 
53 




A man of pains, and acquainted with 
disease, 

And as one from whom men hide 
their face: 

He was despised, and we esteemed 
him not. 

4Surely our diseases he did bear, and 
our pains he carried; 

Whereas we did esteem him 
stricken, 

Smitten of God, and afflicted. 

5But he was wounded because of 
our transgressions, 

He was crushed because of our 
iniquities: 

The chastisement of our welfare was 
upon him, 

And with his stripes we were 
healed. 

6All we like sheep did go astray, 

We turned every one to his own 
way; 

And the LORD hath made to light on 
him 

The iniquity of us all. 

7He was oppressed, though he 
humbled himself 

And opened not his mouth; 

As a lamb that is led to the 
slaughter, 

And as a sheep that before her 
shearers is dumb; 

Yea, he opened not his mouth. 

8By oppression and judgment he 
was taken away, 

And with his generation who did 
reason? 

For he was cut off out of the land of 
the living, 

For the transgression of my people 
to whom the stroke was due. 

9And they made his grave with the 
wicked, 

And with the rich his tomb; 

Although he had done no violence, 

Neither was any deceit in his 
mouth.’ 

 

10Yet it pleased the LORD to crush 
him by disease; 

To see if his soul would offer itself 
in restitution, 

That he might see his seed, prolong 
his days, 

And that the purpose of the LORD 
might prosper by his hand: 

11Of the travail of his soul he shall 
see to the full, even My servant, 

Who by his knowledge did justify 
the Righteous One to the many, 

And their iniquities he did bear. 

12Therefore will I divide him a 
portion among the great, 

And he shall divide the spoil with 
the mighty; 

Because he bared his soul unto 
death, 

And was numbered with the 
transgressors; 

Yet he bore the sin of many, 

And made intercession for the 
transgressors. 

 

Sing, O barren, thou that didst 

 not bear, 

Break forth into singing, and cry 
aloud, thou that didst not travail; 
54 




For more are the children of the 
desolate 

Than the children of the married 
wife, saith the LORD. 

2Enlarge the place of thy tent, 

And let them stretch forth the 
curtains of thy habitations, spare 
not; 

Lengthen thy cords, and strengthen 
thy stakes. 

3For thou shalt spread abroad on the 
right hand and on the left; 

And thy seed shall possess the 
nations, 

And make the desolate cities to be 
inhabited. 

4Fear not, for thou shalt not be 
ashamed. 

Neither be thou confounded, for 
thou shalt not be put to shame; 

For thou shalt forget the shame of 
thy youth, 

And the reproach of thy widowhood 
shalt thou remember no more. 

5For thy Maker is thy husband, 

The LORD of hosts is His name; 

And the Holy One of Israel is thy 
Redeemer, 

The God of the whole earth shall He 
be called. 

6For the LORD hath called thee 

As a wife forsaken and grieved in 
spirit; 

And a wife of youth, can she be 
rejected? 

Saith thy God. 

7For a small moment have I 
forsaken thee; 

But with great compassion will I 
gather thee. 

8In a little wrath I hid My face from 
thee for a moment; 

But with everlasting kindness will I 
have compassion on thee, 

Saith the LORD thy Redeemer. 

9For this is as the waters of Noah 
unto Me; 

For as I have sworn that the waters 
of Noah 

Should no more go over the earth, 

So have I sworn that I would not be 
wroth with thee, 

Nor rebuke thee. 

10For the mountains may depart, 

And the hills be removed; 

But My kindness shall not depart 
from thee, 

Neither shall My covenant of peace 
be removed, 

Saith the LORD that hath compass-
sion on thee. 

 

11O thou afflicted, tossed with 
tempest, 

And not comforted, 

Behold, I will set thy stones in fair 
colours, 

And lay thy foundations with 
sapphires. 

12And I will make thy pinnacles of 
rubies, 

And thy gates of carbuncles, 

And all thy border of precious 
stones. 

13And all thy children shall be 
taught of the LORD; 


And great shall be the peace of thy 
children. 

14In righteousness shalt thou be 
established; 

Be thou far from oppression, for 
thou shalt not fear, 

And from ruin, for it shall not come 
near thee. 

15Behold, they may gather together, 
but not by Me; 

Whosoever shall gather together 
against thee shall fall because of 
thee. 

16Behold, I have created the smith 

That bloweth the fire of coals, 

And bringeth forth a weapon for his 
work; 

And I have created the waster to 
destroy. 

17No weapon that is formed against 
thee shall prosper; 

And every tongue that shall rise 
against thee in judgment thou 
shalt condemn. 

This is the heritage of the servants 
of the LORD, 

And their due reward from Me, saith 
the LORD. 

 

Ho, every one that thirsteth, 
come ye for water, 

And he that hath no money; 

Come ye, buy, and eat; 

Yea, come, buy wine and milk 

Without money and without price. 

2Wherefore do ye spend money for 
that which is not bread? 

And your gain for that which 
satisfieth not? 

Hearken diligently unto Me, and eat 
ye that which is good, 

And let your soul delight itself in 
fatness. 

3Incline your ear, and come unto 
Me; 

Hear, and your soul shall live; 

And I will make an everlasting 
covenant with you, 

Even the sure mercies of David. 

4Behold, I have given him for a 
witness to the peoples, 

A prince and commander to the 
peoples. 

5Behold, thou shalt call a nation that 
thou knowest not, 

And a nation that knew not thee 
shall run unto thee; 

Because of the LORD thy God, 

And for the Holy One of Israel, for 
He hath glorified thee. 

 

6Seek ye the LORD while He may be 
found, 

Call ye upon Him while He is near; 

7Let the wicked forsake his way, 

And the man of iniquity his 
thoughts; 

And let him return unto the LORD, 
and He will have compassion 
upon him, 

And to our God, for He will 
abundantly pardon 

8For My thoughts are not your 
thoughts, 

Neither are your ways My ways, 
saith the LORD. 

9For as the heavens are higher than 
the earth, 
55 




So are My ways higher than your 
ways, 

And My thoughts than your 
thoughts. 

10For as the rain cometh down and 
the snow from heaven, 

And returneth not thither, 

Except it water the earth, 

And make it bring forth and bud, 

And give seed to the sower and 
bread to the eater; 

11So shall My word be that goeth 
forth out of My mouth: 

It shall not return unto Me void, 

Except it accomplish that which I 
please, 

And make the thing whereto I sent it 
prosper. 

12For ye shall go out with joy, 

And be led forth with peace; 

The mountains and the hills shall 
break forth before you into 
singing, 

And all the trees of the field shall 
clap their hands. 

13Instead of the thorn shall come up 
the cypress, 

And instead of the brier shall come 
up the myrtle; 

And it shall be to the LORD for a 
memorial, 

For an everlasting sign that shall not 
be cut off. 

 

Thus saith the LORD: 

Keep ye justice, and do 
righteousness; 

For My salvation is near to come, 

And My favour to be revealed. 

2Happy is the man that doeth this, 

And the son of man that holdeth fast 
by it: 

That keepeth the sabbath from 
profaning it, 

And keepeth his hand from doing 
any evil. 

3Neither let the alien, 

That hath joined himself to the 
LORD, speak, saying: 

‘The LORD will surely separate me 
from His people’; 

Neither let the eunuch say: 

‘Behold, I am a dry tree.’ 

4For thus saith the LORD 

Concerning the eunuchs that keep 
My sabbaths, 

And choose the things that please 
Me, 

And hold fast by My covenant: 

5Even unto them will I give in My 
house 

And within My walls a monument 
and a memorial 

Better than sons and daughters; 

I will give them an everlasting 
memorial, 

That shall not be cut off. 

6Also the aliens, that join 
themselves to the LORD, to 
minister unto Him, 

And to love the name of the LORD, 

To be His servants, 

Every one that keepeth the sabbath 
from profaning it, 

And holdeth fast by My covenant: 

7Even them will I bring to My holy 
mountain, 
56 




And make them joyful in My house 
of prayer; 

Their burnt-offerings and their 
sacrifices 

Shall be acceptable upon Mine altar; 

For My house shall be called 

A house of prayer for all peoples. 

8Saith the Lord GOD who gathereth 
the dispersed of Israel: 

Yet I will gather others to him, 
beside those of him that are 
gathered. 

 

9All ye beasts of the field, come to 
devour, 

Yea, all ye beasts in the forest. 

10His watchmen are all blind, 

Without knowledge; 

They are all dumb dogs, 

They cannot bark; 

Raving, lying down, loving to 
slumber. 

11Yea, the dogs are greedy, 

They know not when they have 
enough; 

And these are shepherds 

That cannot understand; 

They all turn to their own way, 

Each one to his gain, one and all. 

12’Come ye, I will fetch wine, 

And we will fill ourselves with 
strong drink; 

And to-morrow shall be as this day, 

And much more abundant.’ 

 

The righteous perisheth, 

And no man layeth it to heart, 

And godly men are taken away, 

None considering 

That the righteous is taken away 
from the evil to come. 

2He entereth into peace, 

They rest in their beds, 

Each one that walketh in his 
uprightness. 

 

3But draw near hither, 

Ye sons of the sorceress, 

The seed of the adulterer and the 
harlot. 

4Against whom do ye sport 
yourselves? 

Against whom make ye a wide 
mouth, 

And draw out the tongue? 

Are ye not children of transgression, 

A seed of falsehood, 

5Ye that inflame yourselves among 
the terebinths, 

Under every leafy tree; 

That slay the children in the valleys, 

Under the clefts of the rocks? 

6Among the smooth stones of the 
valley is thy portion; 

They, they are thy lot; 

Even to them hast thou poured a 
drink-offering, 

Thou hast offered a meal-offering. 

Should I pacify Myself for these 
things? 

7Upon a high and lofty mountain 

Hast thou set thy bed; 

Thither also wentest thou up 

To offer sacrifice. 

8And behind the doors and the posts 

Hast thou set up thy symbol; 

For thou hast uncovered, and art 
gone up from Me, 
57 




Thou hast enlarged thy bed, 

And chosen thee of them 

Whose bed thou lovedst, 

Whose hand thou sawest. 

9And thou wentest to the king with 
ointment, 

And didst increase thy perfumes, 

And didst send thine ambassadors 
far off, 

Even down to the nether-world. 

10Thou wast wearied with the length 
of thy way; yet saidst thou not: 
‘There is no hope’; thou didst find 
a renewal of thy strength, 
therefore thou wast not affected. 

11And of whom hast thou been 
afraid and in fear, that thou 
wouldest fail? And as for Me, 
thou hast not remembered Me, 
nor laid it to thy heart. Have not I 
held My peace even of long time? 
Therefore thou fearest Me not. 

12I will declare thy righteousness; 
thy works also—they shall not 
profit thee. 

13When thou criest, let them that 
thou hast gathered deliver thee; 
but the wind shall carry them all 
away, a breath shall bear them 
off; but he that taketh refuge in 
Me shall possess the land, and 
shall inherit My holy mountain. 

 

14And He will say: 

Cast ye up, cast ye up, clear the 
way, 

Take up the stumblingblock out of 
the way of My people. 

15For thus saith the High and Lofty 
One 

That inhabiteth eternity, whose 
name is Holy: 

I dwell in the high and holy place, 

With him also that is of a contrite 
and humble spirit, 

To revive the spirit of the humble, 

And to revive the heart of the 
contrite ones. 

16For I will not contend for ever, 

Neither will I be always wroth; 

For the spirit that enwrappeth itself 
is from Me, 

And the souls which I have made. 

17For the iniquity of his 
covetousness was I wroth and 
smote him, 

I hid Me and was wroth; 

And he went on frowardly in the 
way of his heart. 

18I have seen his ways, and will heal 
him; 

I will lead him also, and requite with 
comforts him and his mourners. 

19Peace, peace, to him that is far off 
and to him that is near, 

Saith the LORD that createth the fruit 
of the lips; 

And I will heal him. 

20But the wicked are like the 
troubled sea; 

For it cannot rest, and its waters cast 
up mire and dirt. 

21There is no peace, 

Saith my God concerning the 
wicked. 

 


Cry aloud, spare not, 

Lift up thy voice like a horn, 

And declare unto My people their 
transgression, 

And to the house of Jacob their sins. 

2Yet they seek Me daily, 

And delight to know My ways; 

As a nation that did righteousness, 

And forsook not the ordinance of 
their God, 

They ask of Me righteous 
ordinances, 

They delight to draw near unto God. 

 

3’Wherefore have we fasted, and 
Thou seest not? 

Wherefore have we afflicted our 
soul, and Thou takest no 
knowledge?’— 

Behold, in the day of your fast ye 
pursue your business, 

And exact all your labours. 

4Behold, ye fast for strife and 
contention, 

And to smite with the fist of 
wickedness; 

Ye fast not this day 

So as to make your voice to be 
heard on high. 

5Is such the fast that I have chosen? 

The day for a man to afflict his 
soul? 

Is it to bow down his head as a 
bulrush, 

And to spread sackcloth and ashes 
under him? 

Wilt thou call this a fast, 

And an acceptable day to the LORD? 

6Is not this the fast that I have 
chosen? 

To loose the fetters of wickedness, 

To undo the bands of the yoke, 

And to let the oppressed go free, 

And that ye break every yoke? 

7Is it not to deal thy bread to the 
hungry, 

And that thou bring the poor that are 
cast out to thy house? 

When thou seest the naked, that 
thou cover him, 

And that thou hide not thyself from 
thine own flesh? 

8Then shall thy light break forth as 
the morning, 

And thy healing shall spring forth 
speedily; 

And thy righteousness shall go 
before thee, 

The glory of the LORD shall be thy 
rearward. 

9Then shalt thou call, and the LORD 
will answer; 

Thou shalt cry, and He will say: 
‘Here I am.’ 

If thou take away from the midst of 
thee the yoke, 

The putting forth of the finger, and 
speaking wickedness; 

10And if thou draw out thy soul to 
the hungry, 

And satisfy the afflicted soul; 

Then shall thy light rise in darkness, 

And thy gloom be as the noon-day; 

11And the LORD will guide thee 
continually, 

And satisfy thy soul in drought, 

And make strong thy bones; 
58 




And thou shalt be like a watered 
garden, 

And like a spring of water, whose 
waters fail not. 

12And they that shall be of thee shall 
build the old waste places, 

Thou shalt raise up the foundations 
of many generations; 

And thou shalt be called The 
repairer of the breach, 

The restorer of paths to dwell in. 

13If thou turn away thy foot because 
of the sabbath, 

From pursuing thy business on My 
holy day; 

And call the sabbath a delight, 

And the holy of the LORD 
honourable; 

And shalt honour it, not doing thy 
wonted ways, 

Nor pursuing thy business, nor 
speaking thereof; 

14Then shalt thou delight thyself in 
the LORD, 

And I will make thee to ride upon 
the high places of the earth, 

And I will feed thee with the 
heritage of Jacob thy father; 

For the mouth of the LORD hath 
spoken it. 

 

Behold, the LORD’S hand is 
not shortened, that it cannot 
save, 

Neither His ear heavy, that it cannot 
hear; 

2But your iniquities have separated 

Between you and your God, 

And your sins have hid His face 
from you, 

That He will not hear. 

3For your hands are defiled with 
blood, 

And your fingers with iniquity; 

Your lips have spoken lies, 

Your tongue muttereth wickedness. 

4None sueth in righteousness, 

And none pleadeth in truth; 

They trust in vanity, and speak lies, 

They conceive mischief, and bring 
forth iniquity. 

5They hatch basilisks’eggs, 

And weave the spider’s web; 

He that eateth of their eggs dieth, 

And that which is crushed breaketh 
out into a viper. 

6Their webs shall not become 
garments, 

Neither shall men cover themselves 
with their works; 

Their works are works of iniquity, 

And the act of violence is in their 
hands. 

7Their feet run to evil, 

And they make haste to shed 
innocent blood; 

Their thoughts are thoughts of 
iniquity, 

Desolation and destruction are in 
their paths. 

8The way of peace they know not, 

And there is no right in their goings; 

They have made them crooked 
paths, 

Whosoever goeth therein doth not 
know peace. 
59 




 

9Therefore is justice far from us, 

Neither doth righteousness overtake 
us; 

We look for light, but behold 
darkness, 

For brightness, but we walk in 
gloom. 

10We grope for the wall like the 
blind, 

Yea, as they that have no eyes do 
we grope; 

We stumble at noonday as in the 
twilight; 

We are in dark places like the dead. 

11We all growl like bears, 

And mourn sore like doves; 

We look for right, but there is none; 

For salvation, but it is far off from 
us. 

 

12For our transgressions are 
multiplied before Thee, 

And our sins testify against us; 

For our transgressions are present to 
us, 

And as for our iniquities, we know 
them: 

13Transgressing and denying the 
LORD, 

And turning away from following 
our God, 

Speaking oppression and 
perverseness, 

Conceiving and uttering from the 
heart words of falsehood. 

14And justice is turned away 
backward, 

And righteousness standeth afar off; 

For truth hath stumbled in the broad 
place, 

And uprightness cannot enter. 

15And truth is lacking, 

And he that departeth from evil 
maketh himself a prey. 

 

And the LORD saw it, and it 
displeased Him 

That there was no justice; 

16And He saw that there was no 
man, 

And was astonished that there was 
no intercessor; 

Therefore His own arm brought 
salvation unto Him; 

And His righteousness, it sustained 
Him; 

17And He put on righteousness as a 
coat of mail, 

And a helmet of salvation upon His 
head, 

And He put on garments of 
vengeance for clothing, 

And was clad with zeal as a cloak. 

18According to their deeds, 
accordingly He will repay, 

Fury to His adversaries, recompense 
to His enemies; 

To the islands He will repay 
recompense. 

19So shall they fear the name of the 
LORD from the west, 

And His glory from the rising of the 
sun; 

For distress will come in like a 
flood, 

Which the breath of the LORD 
driveth. 


 

20And a redeemer will come to Zion, 

And unto them that turn from 
transgression in Jacob, 

Saith the LORD. 

21And as for Me, this is My covenant 
with them, saith the LORD; My spirit 
that is upon thee, and My words which 
I have put in thy mouth, shall not 
depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the 
mouth of thy seed, nor out of the 
mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the 
LORD, from henceforth and for ever. 

 

Arise, shine, for thy light is 
come, 

And the glory of the LORD is risen 
upon thee. 

2For, behold, darkness shall cover 
the earth, 

And gross darkness the peoples; 

But upon thee the LORD will arise, 

And His glory shall be seen upon 
thee. 

3And nations shall walk at thy light, 

And kings at the brightness of thy 
rising. 

 

4Lift Up thine eyes round about, and 
see: 

They all are gathered together, and 
come to thee; 

Thy sons come from far, 

And thy daughters are borne on the 
side. 

5Then thou shalt see and be radiant, 

And thy heart shall throb and be 
enlarged; 

Because the abundance of the sea 
shall be turned unto thee, 

The wealth of the nations shall come 
unto thee. 

6The caravan of camels shall cover 
thee, 

And of the young camels of Midian 
and Ephah, 

All coming from Sheba; 

They shall bring gold and incense, 

And shall proclaim the praises of the 
LORD. 

7All the flocks of Kedar shall be 
gathered together unto thee, 

The rams of Nebaioth shall minister 
unto thee; 

They shall come up with acceptance 
on Mine altar, 

And I will glorify My glorious 
house. 

 

8Who are these that fly as a cloud, 

And as the doves to their cotes? 

9Surely the isles shall wait for Me, 

And the ships of Tarshish first, 

To bring thy sons from far, 

Their silver and their gold with 
them, 

For the name of the LORD thy God, 

And for the Holy One of Israel, 
because He hath glorified thee. 

 

10And aliens shall build up thy 
walls, 

And their kings shall minister unto 
thee; 

For in My wrath I smote thee, 

But in My favour have I had 
compassion on thee. 
60 




11Thy gates also shall be open 
continually, 

Day and night, they shall not be 
shut; 

That men may bring unto thee the 
wealth of the nations, 

And their kings in procession. 

12For that nation and kingdom that 
will not serve thee shall perish; 

Yea, those nations shall be utterly 
wasted. 

 

13The glory of Lebanon shall come 
unto thee, 

The cypress, the plane-tree and the 
larch together; 

To beautify the place of My 
sanctuary, 

And I will make the place of My 
feet glorious. 

14And the sons of them that afflicted 
thee 

Shall come bending unto thee, 

And all they that despised thee shall 
bow down 

At the soles of thy feet; 

And they shall call thee The city of 
the LORD, 

The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. 

 

15Whereas thou hast been forsaken 
and hated, 

So that no man passed through thee, 

I will make thee an eternal 
excellency, 

A joy of many generations. 

16Thou shalt also suck the milk of 
the nations, 

And shalt suck the breast of kings; 

And thou shalt know that I the LORD 
am thy Saviour, 

And I, the Mighty One of Jacob, thy 
Redeemer. 

 

17For brass I will bring gold, 

And for iron I will bring silver, 

And for wood brass, 

And for stones iron; 

I will also make thy officers peace, 

And righteousness thy magistrates. 

18Violence shall no more be heard in 
thy land, 

Desolation nor destruction within 
thy borders; 

But thou shalt call thy walls 
Salvation, 

And thy gates Praise. 

 

19The sun shall be no more thy light 
by day, 

Neither for brightness shall the 
moon give light unto thee; 

But the LORD shall be unto thee an 
everlasting light, 

And thy God thy glory. 

20Thy sun shall no more go down, 

Neither shall thy moon withdraw 
itself; 

For the LORD shall be thine 
everlasting light, 

And the days of thy mourning shall 
be ended. 

 

21Thy people also shall be all 
righteous, 

They shall inherit the land for ever; 

The branch of My planting, the 
work of My hands, 


Wherein I glory. 

22The smallest shall become a 
thousand, 

And the least a mighty nation; 

I the LORD will hasten it in its time. 

 

The spirit of the Lord God is 
upon me; 

Because the LORD hath anointed me 

To bring good tidings unto the 
humble; 

He hath sent me to bind up the 
broken-hearted, 

To proclaim liberty to the captives, 

And the opening of the eyes to them 
that are bound; 

2To proclaim the year of the LORD’S 
good pleasure, 

And the day of vengeance of our 
God; 

To comfort all that mourn; 

3To appoint unto them that mourn in 
Zion, 

To give unto them a garland for 
ashes, 

The oil of joy for mourning, 

The mantle of praise for the spirit of 
heaviness; 

That they might be called terebinths 
of righteousness, 

The planting of the LORD, wherein 
He might glory. 

4And they shall build the old wastes, 

They shall raise up the former 
desolations, 

And they shall renew the waste 
cities, 

The desolations of many 
generations. 

5And strangers shall stand and feed 
your flocks, 

And aliens shall be your plowmen 
and your vinedressers. 

6But ye shall be named the priests of 
the LORD, 

Men shall call you the ministers of 
our God; 

Ye shall eat the wealth of the 
nations, 

And in their splendour shall ye 
revel. 

7For your shame which was double, 

And for that they rejoiced: 
‘Confusion is their portion’; 

Therefore in their land they shall 
possess double, 

Everlasting joy shall be unto them. 

 

8For I the LORD love justice, 

I hate robbery with iniquity; 

And I will give them their 
recompense in truth, 

And I will make an everlasting 
covenant with them. 

9And their seed shall be known 
among the nations, 

And their offspring among the 
peoples; 

All that see them shall acknowledge 
them, 

That they are the seed which the 
LORD hath blessed. 

 

10I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, 

My soul shall be joyful in my God; 

For He hath clothed me with the 
garments of salvation, 
61 




He hath covered me with the robe of 
victory, 

As a bridegroom putteth on a 
priestly diadem, 

And as a bride adorneth herself with 
her jewels. 

11For as the earth bringeth forth her 
growth, 

And as the garden causeth the things 
that are sown in it to spring forth; 

So the Lord GOD will cause victory 
and glory 

To spring forth before all the 
nations. 

 

For Zion’s sake will I not 
hold My peace, 

And for Jerusalem’s sake I will not 
rest, 

Until her triumph go forth as 
brightness, 

And her salvation as a torch that 
burneth. 

2And the nations shall see thy 
triumph, 

And all kings thy glory; 

And thou shalt be called by a new 
name, 

Which the mouth of the LORD shall 
mark out. 

3Thou shalt also be a crown of 
beauty in the hand of the LORD, 

And a royal diadem in the open 
hand of thy God. 

4Thou shalt no more be termed 
Forsaken, 

Neither shall thy land any more be 
termed Desolate; 

But thou shalt be called, My delight 
is in her, 

And thy land, Espoused; 

For the LORD delighteth in thee, 

And thy land shall be espoused. 

5For as a young man espouseth a 
virgin, 

So shall thy sons espouse thee; 

And as the bridegroom rejoiceth 
over the bride, 

So shall thy God rejoice over thee. 

 

6I have set watchmen 

Upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, 

They shall never hold their peace 

Day nor night: 

‘Ye that are the LORD’S 
remembrancers, 

Take ye no rest, 

7And give Him no rest, 

Till He establish, 

And till He make Jerusalem 

A praise in the earth.’ 

8The LORD hath sworn by His right 
hand, 

And by the arm of His strength: 

Surely I will no more give thy corn 

To be food for thine enemies; 

And strangers shall not drink thy 
wine, 

For which thou hast laboured; 

9But they that have garnered it shall 
eat it, 

And praise the LORD, 

And they that have gathered it shall 
drink it 

In the courts of My sanctuary. 

 

10Go through, go through the gates, 
62 




Clear ye the way of the people; 

Cast up, cast up the highway, 

Gather out the stones; 

Lift up an ensign over the peoples. 

11Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed 

Unto the end of the earth: 

Say ye to the daughter of Zion: 

‘Behold, thy salvation cometh; 

Behold, His reward is with Him, 

And His recompense before Him.’ 

12And they shall call them The holy 
people, 

The redeemed of the LORD; 

And thou shalt be called Sought out, 

A city not forsaken. 

 

’Who is this that cometh from 
Edom, 

With crimsoned garments from 
Bozrah? 

This that is glorious in his apparel, 

Stately in the greatness of his 
strength?’— 

’I that speak in victory, mighty to 
save.’— 

2’Wherefore is Thine apparel red, 

And Thy garments like his that 
treadeth in the winevat?’— 

3’I have trodden the winepress 
alone, 

And of the peoples there was no 
man with Me; 

Yea, I trod them in Mine anger, 

And trampled them in My fury; 

And their lifeblood is dashed against 
My garments, 

And I have stained all My raiment. 

4For the day of vengeance that was 
in My heart, 

And My year of redemption are 
come. 

5And I looked, and there was none 
to help, 

And I beheld in astonishment, and 
there was none to uphold; 

Therefore Mine own arm brought 
salvation unto Me, 

And My fury, it upheld Me. 

6And I trod down the peoples in 
Mine anger, 

And made them drunk with My 
fury, 

And I poured out their lifeblood on 
the earth.’ 

 

7I will make mention of the mercies 
of the LORD, 

And the praises of the LORD, 

According to all that the LORD hath 
bestowed on us; 

And the great goodness toward the 
house of Israel, 

Which He hath bestowed on them 
according to His compassions, 

And according to the multitude of 
His mercies. 

8For He said: ‘Surely, they are My 
people, 

Children that will not deal falsely’; 

So He was their Saviour. 

9In all their affliction He was 
afflicted, 

And the angel of His presence saved 
them; 

In His love and in His pity He 
redeemed them; 

And He bore them, and carried them 
all the days of old. 
63 




10But they rebelled, and grieved His 
holy spirit; 

Therefore He was turned to be their 
enemy, 

Himself fought against them. 

11Then His people remembered the 
days of old, the days of Moses: 

‘Where is He that brought them up 
out of the sea 

With the shepherds of His flock? 

Where is He that put His holy spirit 

In the midst of them? 

12That caused His glorious arm to go 
at the right hand of Moses? 

That divided the water before them, 

To make Himself an everlasting 
name? 

13That led them through the deep, 

As a horse in the wilderness, 
without stumbling? 

14As the cattle that go down into the 
valley, 

The spirit of the LORD caused them 
to rest; 

So didst Thou lead Thy people, 

To make Thyself a glorious name.’ 

 

15Look down from heaven, and see, 

Even from Thy holy and glorious 
habitation; 

Where is Thy zeal and Thy mighty 
acts, 

The yearning of Thy heart and Thy 
compassions, 

Now restrained toward me? 

16For Thou art our Father; 

For Abraham knoweth us not, 

And Israel doth not acknowledge us; 

Thou, O LORD, art our Father, 

Our Redeemer from everlasting is 
Thy name. 

17O LORD, why dost Thou make us to 
err from Thy ways, 

And hardenest our heart from Thy 
fear? 

Return for Thy servants’sake, 

The tribes of Thine inheritance. 

18Thy holy people they have well 
nigh driven out, 

Our adversaries have trodden down 
Thy sanctuary. 

19We are become as they over whom 
Thou never borest rule, 

As they that were not called by Thy 
name. 

 

Oh, that Thou wouldest rend the 
heavens, that Thou wouldest 
come down, 

That the mountains might quake at 
Thy presence, 

As when fire kindleth the 
brush-wood, 

And the fire causeth the waters to 
boil; 

To make Thy name known to Thine 
adversaries, 

That the nations might tremble at 
Thy presence, 

2When Thou didst tremendous 
things 

Which we looked not for— 

Oh that Thou wouldest come down, 
that the mountains might quake at 
Thy presence!— 

3And whereof from of old men have 
not heard, nor perceived by the 
ear, 
64 




Neither hath the eye seen a God 
beside Thee, 

Who worketh for him that waiteth 
for Him. 

 

4Thou didst take away him that 
joyfully worked righteousness, 

Those that remembered Thee in Thy 
ways— 

Behold, Thou wast wroth, and we 
sinned— 

Upon them have we stayed of old, 
that we might be saved. 

5And we are all become as one that 
is unclean, 

And all our righteousnesses are as a 
polluted garment; 

And we all do fade as a leaf, 

And our iniquities, like the wind, 
take us away. 

6And there is none that calleth upon 
Thy name, 

That stirreth up himself to take hold 
of Thee; 

For Thou hast hid Thy face from us, 

And hast consumed us by means of 
our iniquities. 

 

7But now, O LORD, Thou art our 
Father; 

We are the clay, and Thou our 
potter, 

And we all are the work of Thy 
hand. 

8Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, 

Neither remember iniquity for ever; 

Behold, look, we beseech Thee, we 
are all Thy people. 

9Thy holy cities are become a 
wilderness, 

Zion is become a wilderness, 

Jerusalem a desolation. 

10Our holy and our beautiful house, 

Where our fathers praised Thee, 

Is burned with fire; 

And all our pleasant things are laid 
waste. 

11Wilt Thou refrain Thyself for these 
things, O LORD? 

Wilt Thou hold Thy peace, and 
afflict us very sore? 

65 



I gave access to them that 
asked not for Me, 

I was at hand to them that sought 
Me not; 

I said: ‘Behold Me, behold Me’, 

Unto a nation that was not called 
by My name. 

2I have spread out My hands all the 
day 

Unto a rebellious people, 

That walk in a way that is not good, 

After their own thoughts; 

3A people that provoke Me 

To My face continually, 

That sacrifice in gardens, 

And burn incense upon bricks; 

4That sit among the graves, 

And lodge in the vaults; 

That eat swine’s flesh, 

And broth of abominable things is in 
their vessels; 

5That say: ‘Stand by thyself, 

Come not near to me, for I am holier 
than thou’; 

These are a smoke in My nose, 

A fire that burneth all the day. 


6Behold, it is written before Me; 

I will not keep silence, except I have 
requited, 

Yea, I will requite into their bosom, 

7Your own iniquities, and the 
iniquities of your fathers together, 

Saith the LORD, that have offered 
upon the mountains, 

And blasphemed Me upon the hills; 

Therefore will I first measure their 
wage into their bosom. 

 

8Thus saith the LORD: 

As, when wine is found in the 
cluster, 

One saith: ‘Destroy it not, 

For a blessing is in it’; 

So will I do for My servants’ sakes, 

That I may not destroy all. 

9And I will bring forth a seed out of 
Jacob, 

And out of Judah an inheritor of My 
mountains; 

And Mine elect shall inherit it, 

And My servants shall dwell there. 

10And Sharon shall be a fold of 
flocks, 

And the valley of Achor a place for 
herds to lie down in, 

For My people that have sought Me; 

11But ye that forsake the LORD, 

That forget My holy mountain, 

That prepare a table for Fortune, 

And that offer mingled wine in full 
measure unto Destiny, 

12I will destine you to the sword, 

And ye shall all bow down to the 
slaughter; 

Because when I called, ye did not 
answer, 

Ehen I spoke, ye did not hear; 

But ye did that which was evil in 
Mine eyes, 

And chose that wherein I delighted 
not. 

 

13Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 

Behold, My servants shall eat, 

But ye shall be hungry; 

Behold, My servants shall drink, 

But ye shall be thirsty; 

Behold, My servants shall rejoice, 

But ye shall be ashamed; 

14Behold, My servants shall sing 

For joy of heart, 

But ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, 

And shall wail for vexation of spirit. 

15And ye shall leave your name for a 
curse unto Mine elect: 

‘So may the Lord GOD slay thee’; 

But He shall call His servants by 
another name; 

16So that he who blesseth himself in 
the earth 

Shall bless himself by the God of 
truth; 

And he that sweareth in the earth 

Shall swear by the God of truth; 

Because the former troubles are 
forgotten, 

And because they are hid from Mine 
eyes. 

17For, behold, I create new heavens 

And a new earth; 

And the former things shall not be 
remembered, 

Nor come into mind. 


18But be ye glad and rejoice for ever 

In that which I create; 

For, behold, I create Jerusalem a 
rejoicing, 

And her people a joy. 

19And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, 

And joy in My people; 

And the voice of weeping shall be 
no more heard in her, 

Nor the voice of crying. 

20There shall be no more thence an 
infant of days, nor an old man, 

That hath not filled his days; 

For the youngest shall die a hundred 
years old, 

And the sinner being a hundred 
years old shall be accursed. 

21And they shall build houses, and 
inhabit them; 

And they shall plant vineyards, and 
eat the fruit of them. 

22They shall not build, and another 
inhabit, 

They shall not plant, and another 
eat; 

For as the days of a tree shall be the 
days of My people, 

And Mine elect shall long enjoy the 
work of their hands. 

23They shall not labour in vain, 

Nor bring forth for terror; 

For they are the seed blessed of the 
LORD, 

And their offspring with them. 

24And it shall come to pass that, 
before they call, I will answer, 

And while they are yet speaking, I 
will hear. 

25The wolf and the lamb shall feed 
together, 

And the lion shall eat straw like the 
ox; 

And dust shall be the serpent’s food. 

They shall not hurt nor destroy in all 
My holy mountain, 

Saith the LORD. 

 

66 



Thus saith the LORD: 

The heaven is My throne, 

And the earth is My footstool; 

Where is the house that ye may 
build unto Me? 

And where is the place that may be 
My resting-place? 

2For all these things hath My hand 
made, 

And so all these things came to be, 

Saith the LORD; 

But on this man will I look, 

Even on him that is poor and of a 
contrite spirit, 

And trembleth at My word. 

3He that killeth an ox is as if he slew 
a man; 

He that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he 
broke a dog’s neck; 

He that offereth a meal-offering, as 
if he offered swine’s blood; 

He that maketh a memorial-offering 
of frankincense, as if he blessed 
an idol; 

According as they have chosen their 
own ways, 

And their soul delighteth in their 
abominations; 

4Even so I will choose their 
mockings, 


And will bring their fears upon 
them; 

Because when I called, none did 
answer; 

When I spoke, they did not hear, 

But they did that which was evil in 
Mine eyes, 

And chose that in which I delighted 
not. 

 

5Hear the word of the LORD, 

Ye that tremble at His word: 

Your brethren that hate you, that 
cast you out for My name’s sake, 
have said: 

‘Let the LORD be glorified, 

That we may gaze upon your joy’, 

But they shall be ashamed. 

6Hark! an uproar from the city, 

Hark! it cometh from the temple, 

Hark! the LORD rendereth 
recompense to His enemies. 

7Before she travailed, she brought 
forth; 

Before her pain came, 

She was delivered of a man-child. 

8Who hath heard such a thing? 

Who hath seen such things? 

Is a land born in one day? 

Is a nation brought forth at once? 

For as soon as Zion travailed, 

She brought forth her children. 

9Shall I bring to the birth, and not 
cause to bring forth? 

Saith the LORD; 

Shall I that cause to bring forth shut 
the womb? 

Saith thy God. 

 

10Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, 

And be glad with her, all ye that 
love her; 

Rejoice for joy with her, 

All ye that mourn for her; 

11That ye may suck, and be satisfied 

With the breast of her consolations; 

That ye may drink deeply with 
delight 

Of the abundance of her glory. 

12For thus saith the LORD: 

Behold, I will extend peace to her 
like a river. 

And the wealth of the nations like 
an overflowing stream, 

And ye shall suck thereof: 

Ye shall be borne upon the side, 

And shall be dandled upon the 
knees. 

13As one whom his mother 
comforteth, 

So will I comfort you; 

And ye shall be comforted in 
Jerusalem. 

14And when ye see this, your heart 
shall rejoice, 

And your bones shall flourish like 
young grass; 

And the hand of the LORD shall be 
known toward His servants, 

And He will have indignation 
against His enemies. 

 

15For, behold, the LORD will come in 
fire, 

And His chariots shall be like the 
whirlwind; 

To render His anger with fury, 

And His rebuke with flames of fire. 


16For by fire will the LORD contend, 

And by His sword with all flesh; 

And the slain of the LORD shall be 
many. 

17They that sanctify themselves and 
purify themselves 

To go unto the gardens, 

Behind one in the midst, 

Eating swine’s flesh, and the 
detestable thing, and the mouse, 

Shall be consumed together, saith 
the LORD. 

18For I [know] their works and their 
thoughts; [the time] cometh, that I will 
gather all nations and tongues; and 
they shall come, and shall see My 
glory. 19And I will work a sign among 
them, and I will send such as escape of 
them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul 
and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal 
and Javan, to the isles afar off, that 
have not heard My fame, neither have 
seen My glory; and they shall declare 
My glory among the nations. 20And 
they shall bring all your brethren out 
of all the nations for an offering unto 
the LORD, upon horses, and in chariots, 
and in fitters, and upon mules, and 
upon swift beasts, to My holy 
mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as 
the children of Israel bring their 
offering in a clean vessel into the 
house of the LORD. 21And of them also 
will I take for the priests and for the 
Levites, saith the LORD. 22For as the 
new heavens and the new earth, which 
I will make, shall remain before Me, 
saith the LORD, so shall your seed and 
your name remain. 

23And it shall come to pass, 

That from one new moon to another, 

And from one sabbath to another, 

Shall all flesh come to worship 
before Me, 

Saith the LORD. 

24And they shall go forth, and look 

Upon the carcasses of the men that 
have rebelled against Me; 

For their worm shall not die, 

Neither shall their fire be quenched; 

And they shall be an abhorring unto 
all flesh. 

 

And it shall come to pass, 

That from one new moon to another, 

And from one sabbath to another, 

Shall all flesh come to worship before Me, 

Saith the Lord.
