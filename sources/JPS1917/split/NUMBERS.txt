NUMBERS 

 

AND THE LORD spoke unto Moses 
in the wilderness of Sinai, in the 
tent of meeting, on the first day of the 
second month, in the second year after 
the were come out of the land of 
Egypt, saying: 2’Take ye the sum of all 
the congregation of the children of 
Israel, by their families, by their 
fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, every male, by their 
polls; 3from twenty years old and 
upward, all that are able to go forth to 
war in Israel: ye shall number them by 
their hosts, even thou and Aaron. 4And 
with you there shall be a man of every 
tribe, every one head of his 
fathers’house. 5And these are the 
names of the men that shall stand with 
you: of Reuben, Elizur the son of 
Shedeur. 6Of Simeon, Shelumiel the 
son of Zurishaddai. 7Of Judah, 
Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 8Of 
Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar. 9Of 
Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon. 10Of 
the children of Joseph: of Ephraim, 
Elishama the son of Ammihud; of 
Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of 
Pedahzur. 11Of Benjamin, Abidan the 
son of Gideoni. 12Of Dan, Ahiezer the 
son of Ammishaddai. 13Of Asher, 
Pagiel the son of Ochran. 14Of Gad, 
Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 15Of 
Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan.’ 
16These were the elect of the 
congregation, the princes of the tribes 
of their fathers; they were the heads of 
the thousands of Israel. 17And Moses 
and Aaron took these men that are 
pointed out by name. 18And they 
assembled all the congregation 
together on the first day of the second 
month, and they declared their 
pedigrees after their families, by their 
fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, from twenty years 
old and upward, by their polls. 19As 
the LORD commanded Moses, so did he 
number them in the wilderness of 
Sinai. 

20And the children of Reuben, 
Israel’s first-born, their generations, by 
their families, by their fathers’houses, 
according to the number of names, by 
their polls, every male from twenty 
years old and upward, all that were 
able to go forth to war; 21those that 
were numbered of them, of the tribe of 
Reuben, were forty and six thousand 
and five hundred. 

22Of the children of Simeon, their 
generations, by their families, by their 
fathers’houses, those that were 
numbered thereof, according to the 
number of names, by their polls, every 
male from twenty years old and 
upward, all that were able to go forth 
to war; 23those that were numbered of 
1 




them, of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty 
and nine thousand and three hundred.

generations, by their families, by their 
fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, from twenty years 
old and upward, all that were able to 
go forth to war; 25those that were 
numbered of them, of the tribe of Gad, 
were forty and five thousand six 
hundred and fifty. 

26Of the children of Judah, their 
generations, by their families, by their 
fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, from twenty years 
old and upward, all that were able to

numbered of them, of the tribe of 
Judah, were threescore and fourteen 
thousand and six hundred. 

28Of the children of Issachar, their

fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, from twenty years 
old and upward, all that were able to

numbered of them, of the tribe of 
Issachar, were fifty and four thousand 
and four hundred. 

30Of the children of Zebulun, their

fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, from twenty years 
old and upward, all that were able to 
go forth to war; 31those that were 
numbered of them, of the tribe of 
Zebulun, were fifty and seven 
thousand and four hundred. 

32Of the children of Joseph, namely, 
of the children of Ephraim, their 
generations, by their families, by their 
fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, from twenty years 
old and upward, all that were able to 
go forth to war; 33those that were 
numbered of them, of the tribe of 
Ephraim, were forty thousand and five 
hundred. 

34Of the children of Manasseh, their 
generations, by their families, by their 
fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, from twenty years 
old and upward, all that were able to 
go forth to war; 35those that were 
numbered of them, of the tribe of 
Manasseh, were thirty and two 
thousand and two hundred. 

36Of the children of Benjamin, their 
generations, by their families, by their 
fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, from twenty years

numbered of them, of the tribe of

thousand and four hundred.

numbered of them, of the tribe of Dan, 
were threescore and two thousand and 
seven hundred. 

40Of the children of Asher, their

fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, from twenty years

numbered of them, of the tribe of 
Asher, were forty and one thousand 
and five hundred. 

42Of the children of Naphtali, their 
generations, by their families, by their 
fathers’houses, according to the 
number of names, from twenty years 
old and upward, all that were able to 
go forth to war; 43those that were 
numbered of them, of the tribe of 
Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand 
and four hundred. 

44These are those that were 
numbered, which Moses and Aaron 
numbered, and the princes of Israel, 
being twelve men; they were each one 
for his fathers’house. 45And all those 
that were numbered of the children of 
Israel by their fathers’houses, from 
twenty years old and upward, all that 
were able to go forth to war in Israel; 
46even all those that were numbered 
were six hundred thousand and three 
thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
47But the Levites after the tribe of their 
fathers were not numbered among 
them. 

48And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 49’Howbeit the tribe of Levi 
thou shalt not number, neither shalt 
thou take the sum of them among the 
children of Israel; 50but appoint thou 
the Levites over the tabernacle of the 
testimony, and over all the furniture 
thereof, and over all that belongeth to 
it; they shall bear the tabernacle, and 
all the furniture thereof; and they shall 
minister unto it, and shall encamp 
round about the tabernacle. 51And 
when the tabernacle setteth forward, 
the Levites shall take it down; and 
when the tabernacle is to be pitched, 
the Levites shall set it up; and the 
common man that draweth nigh shall 
be put to death. 52And the children of 
Israel shall pitch their tents, every man 
with his own camp, and every man 
with his own standard, according to 
their hosts. 53But the Levites shall 
pitch round about the tabernacle of the 
testimony, that there be no wrath upon 
the congregation of the children of 
Israel; and the Levites shall keep the 
charge of the tabernacle of the 
testimony.’ 54Thus did the children of 
Israel; according to all that the LORD 
commanded Moses, so did they. 

And the LORD spoke unto Moses 
and unto Aaron, saying: 2’The 
children of Israel shall pitch by their 
fathers’houses; every man with his 
own standard, according to the 
ensigns; a good way off shall they 
pitch round about the tent of meeting. 
3Now those that pitch on the east side 
toward the sunrising shall be they of 
the standard of the camp of Judah, 
according to their hosts; the prince of 
the children of Judah being Nahshon 
the son of Amminadab, 4and his host, 
and those that were numbered of them, 
threescore and fourteen thousand and 
six hundred; 5and those that pitch next 
unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar; 
2 




the prince of the children of Issachar 
being Nethanel the son of Zuar, 6and 
his host, even those that were 
numbered thereof, fifty and four 
thousand and four hundred; 7and the 
tribe of Zebulun; the prince of the 
children of Zebulun being Eliab the 
son of Helon, 8and his host, and those 
that were numbered thereof, fifty and 
seven thousand and four hundred; 9all 
that were numbered of the camp of 
Judah being a hundred thousand and 
fourscore thousand and six thousand 
and four hundred, according to their 
hosts; they shall set forth first. 

10On the south side shall be the 
standard of the camp of Reuben 
according to their hosts; the prince of 
the children of Reuben being Elizur 
the son of Shedeur, 11and his host, and 
those that were numbered thereof, 
forty and six thousand and five 
hundred; 12and those that pitch next 
unto him shall be the tribe of Simeon; 
the prince of the children of Simeon 
being Shelumiel the son of 
Zurishaddai, 13and his host, and those 
that were numbered of them, fifty and 
nine thousand and three hundred; 14and 
the tribe of Gad; the prince of the 
children of Gad being Eliasaph the son 
of Reuel, 15and his host, even those 
that were numbered of them, forty and 
five thousand and six hundred and 
fifty; 16all that were numbered of the 
camp of Reuben being a hundred 
thousand and fifty and one thousand 
and four hundred and fifty, according 
to their hosts; and they shall set forth 
second. 

17Then the tent of meeting, with the 
camp of the Levites, shall set forward 
in the midst of the camps; as they 
encamp, so shall they set forward, 
every man in his place, by their 
standards. 

18On the west side shall be the 
standard of the camp of Ephraim 
according to their hosts; the prince of 
the children of Ephraim being 
Elishama the son of Ammihud, 19and 
his host, and those that were numbered 
of them, forty thousand and five 
hundred; 20and next unto him shall be 
the tribe of Manasseh; the prince of the 
children of Manasseh being Gamaliel 
the son of Pedahzur, 21and his host, 
and those that were numbered of them, 
thirty and two thousand and two 
hundred; 22and the tribe of Benjamin; 
the prince of the children of Benjamin 
being Abidan the son of Gideoni, 23and 
his host, and those that were numbered 
of them, thirty and five thousand and 
four hundred; 24all that were numbered 
of the camp of Ephraim being a 
hundred thousand and eight thousand 
and a hundred, according to their 
hosts; and they shall set forth third. 

25On the north side shall be the 
standard of the camp of Dan according 
to their hosts; the prince of the 
children of Dan being Ahiezer the son 
of Ammishaddai, 26and his host, and 
those that were numbered of them, 
threescore and two thousand and seven 
hundred; 27and those that pitch next 


unto him shall be the tribe of Asher; 
the prince of the children of Asher 
being Pagiel the son of Ochran, 28and 
his host, and those that were numbered 
of them, forty and one thousand and 
five hundred; 29and the tribe of 
Naphtali; the prince of the children of 
Naphtali being Ahira the son of Enan, 
30and his host, and those that were 
numbered of them, fifty and three 
thousand and four hundred; 31all that 
were numbered of the camp of Dan 
being a hundred thousand and fifty and 
seven thousand and six hundred; they 
shall set forth hindmost by their 
standards.’ 

32These are they that were numbered 
of the children of Israel by their 
fathers’houses; all that were numbered 
of the camps according to their hosts 
were six hundred thousand and three 
thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
33But the Levites were not numbered 
among the children of Israel; as the 
LORD commanded Moses. 34Thus did 
the children of Israel: according to all 
that the LORD commanded Moses, so 
they pitched by their standards, and so 
they set forward, each one according 
to its families, and according to its 
fathers’houses. 

Now these are the generations of 
Aaron and Moses in the day that 
the LORD spoke with Moses in mount 
Sinai. 2And these are the names of the 
sons of Aaron: Nadab the first-born, 
and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
3These are the names of the sons of 
Aaron, the priests that were anointed, 
whom he consecrated to minister in 
the priest’s office. 4And Nadab and 
Abihu died before the LORD, when they 
offered strange fire before the LORD, in 
the wilderness of Sinai, and they had 
no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar 
ministered in the priest’s office in the 
presence of Aaron their father. 

5And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 6’Bring the tribe of Levi near, 
and set them before Aaron the priest, 
that they may minister unto him. 7And 
they shall keep his charge, and the 
charge of the whole congregation 
before the tent of meeting, to do the 
service of the tabernacle. 8And they 
shall keep all the furniture of the tent 
of meeting, and the charge of the 
children of Israel, to do the service of 
the tabernacle. 9And thou shalt give 
the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons; 
they are wholly given unto him from 
the children of Israel. 10And thou shalt 
appoint Aaron and his sons, that they 
may keep their priesthood; and the 
common man that draweth nigh shall 
be put to death.’ 

11And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 12’And I, behold, I have taken 
the Levites from among the children of 
Israel instead of every first-born that 
openeth the womb among the children 
of Israel; and the Levites shall be 
Mine; 13for all the first-born are Mine: 
on the day that I smote all the first-
born in the land of Egypt I hallowed 
unto Me all the first-born in Israel, 
both man and beast, Mine they shall 
be: I am the LORD.’ 
3 




14And the LORD spoke unto Moses in 
the wilderness of Sinai, saying: 
15’Number the children of Levi by 
their fathers’houses, by their families; 
every male from a month old and 
upward shalt thou number them.’ 
16And Moses numbered them 
according to the word of the LORD, as 
he was commanded. 17And these were 
the sons of Levi by their names: 
Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. 
18And these are the names of the sons 
of Gershon by their families: Libni and 
Shimei. 19And the sons of Kohath by 
their families: Amram and Izhar, 
Hebron and Uzziel. 20And the sons of 
Merari by their families: Mahli and 
Mushi. These are the families of the 
Levites according to their 
fathers’houses. 

21Of Gershon was the family of the 
Libnites, and the family of the 
Shimeites; these are the families of the 
Gershonites. 22Those that were 
numbered of them, according to the 
number of all the males, from a month 
old and upward, even those that were 
numbered of them were seven 
thousand and five hundred. 23The 
families of the Gershonites were to 
pitch behind the tabernacle westward; 
24the prince of the fathers’house of the 
Gershonites being Eliasaph the son of 
Lael, 25and the charge of the sons of 
Gershon in the tent of meeting the 
tabernacle, and the Tent, the covering 
thereof, and the screen for the door of 
the tent of meeting, 26and the hangings 
of the court, and the screen for the 
door of the court—which is by the 
tabernacle, and by the altar, round 
about—and the cords of it, even 
whatsoever pertaineth to the service 
thereof. 

27And of Kohath was the family of 
the Amramites, and the family of the 
Izharites, and the family of the 
Hebronites, and the family of the 
Uzzielites; these are the families of the 
Kohathites: 28according to the number 
of all the males, from a month old and 
upward, eight thousand and six 
hundred, keepers of the charge of the 
sanctuary. 29The families of the sons of 
Kohath were to pitch on the side of the 
tabernacle southward; 30the prince of 
the fathers’house of the families of the 
Kohathites being Elizaphan the son of 
Uzziel, 31and their charge the ark, and 
the table, and the candlestick, and the 
altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary 
wherewith the priests minister, and the 
screen, and all that pertaineth to the 
service thereof; 32Eleazar the son of 
Aaron the priest being prince of the 
princes of the Levites, and having the 
oversight of them that keep the charge 
of the sanctuary. 

33Of Merari was the family of the 
Mahlites, and the family of the 
Mushites; these are the families of 
Merari. 34And those that were 
numbered of them, according to the 
number of all the males, from a month 
old and upward, were six thousand and 
two hundred; 35the prince of the 
fathers’house of the families of Merari 
being Zuriel the son of Abihail; they 


were to pitch on the side of the 
tabernacle northward; 36the appointed 
charge of the sons of Merari being the 
boards of the tabernacle, and the bars 
thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the 
sockets thereof, and all the instruments 
thereof, and all that pertaineth to the 
service thereof; 37and the pillars of the 
court round about, and their sockets, 
and their pins, and their cords. 38And 
those that were to pitch before the 
tabernacle eastward, before the tent of 
meeting toward the sunrising, were 
Moses, and Aaron and his sons, 
keeping the charge of the sanctuary, 
even the charge for the children of 
Israel; and the common man that drew 
nigh was to be put to death. 39All that 
were numbered of the Levites, whom 
Moses and Aaron numbered at the 
commandment of the LORD, by their 
families, all the males from a month 
old and upward, were twenty and two 
thousand. 

40And the LORD said unto Moses: 
‘Number all the first-born males of the 
children of Israel from a month old 
and upward, and take the number of 
their names. 41And thou shalt take the 
Levites for Me, even the LORD, instead 
of all the first-born among the children 
of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites 
instead of all the firstlings among the 
cattle of the children of Israel.’ 42And 
Moses numbered, as the LORD 
commanded him, all the first-born 
among the children of Israel. 43And all 
the first-born males according to the 
number of names, from a month old 
and upward, of those that were 
numbered of them, were twenty and 
two thousand two hundred and 
threescore and thirteen. 

44And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 45’Take the Levites instead of 
all the first-born among the children of 
Israel, and the cattle of the Levites 
instead of their cattle; and the Levites 
shall be Mine, even the LORD’S. 46And 
as for the redemption of the two 
hundred and three score and thirteen of 
the first-born of the children of Israel, 
that are over and above the number of 
the Levites, 47thou shalt take five 
shekels apiece by the poll; after the 
shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take 
them—the shekel is twenty gerahs. 
48And thou shalt give the money 
wherewith they that remain over of 
them are redeemed unto Aaron and to 
his sons.’ 49And Moses took the 
redemption-money from them that 
were over and above them that were 
redeemed by the Levites; 50from the 
first-born of the children of Israel took 
he the money: a thousand three 
hundred and threescore and five 
shekels, after the shekel of the 
sanctuary. 51And Moses gave the 
redemption-money unto Aaron and to 
his sons, according to the word of the 
LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto Moses 
and unto Aaron, saying: 2’Take 
the sum of the sons of Kohath from 
among the sons of Levi, by their 
families, by their fathers’houses, 3from 
4 




thirty years old and upward even until 
fifty years old, all that enter upon the 
service, to do work in the tent of 
meeting. 4This is the service of the 
sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, 
about the most holy things: 5when the 
camp setteth forward, Aaron shall go 
in, and his sons, and they shall take 
down the veil of the screen, and cover 
the ark of the testimony with it; 6and 
shall put thereon a covering of 
sealskin, and shall spread over it a 
cloth all of blue, and shall set the 
staves thereof. 7And upon the table of 
showbread they shall spread a cloth of 
blue, and put thereon the dishes, and 
the pans, and the bowls, and the jars 
wherewith to pour out; and the 
continual bread shall remain thereon. 
8And they shall spread upon them a 
cloth of scarlet, and cover the same 
with a covering of sealskin, and shall 
set the staves thereof. 9And they shall 
take a cloth of blue, and cover the 
candlestick of the light, and its lamps, 
and its tongs, and its snuffdishes, and 
all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith 
they minister unto it. 10And they shall 
put it and all the vessels thereof within 
a covering of sealskin, and shall put it 
upon a bar. 11And upon the golden 
altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, 
and cover it with a covering of 
sealskin, and shall set the staves 
thereof. 12And they shall take all the 
vessels of ministry, wherewith they 
minister in the sanctuary, and put them 
in a cloth of blue, and cover them with 
a covering of sealskin, and shall put 
them on a bar. 13And they shall take 
away the ashes from the altar, and 
spread a purple cloth thereon. 14And 
they shall put upon it all the vessels 
thereof, wherewith they minister about 
it, the fire-pans, the flesh-hooks, and 
the shovels, and the basins, all the 
vessels of the altar; and they shall 
spread upon it a covering of sealskin, 
and set the staves thereof. 15And when 
Aaron and his sons have made an end 
of covering the holy furniture, and all 
the holy vessels, as the camp is to set 
forward—after that, the sons of 
Kohath shall come to bear them; but 
they shall not touch the holy things, 
lest they die. These things are the 
burden of the sons of Kohath in the 
tent of meeting. 16And the charge of 
Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest 
shall be the oil for the light, and the 
sweet incense, and the continual meal-
offering, and the anointing oil: he shall 
have the charge of all the tabernacle, 
and of all that therein is, whether it be 
the sanctuary, or the furniture thereof.’ 
17And the LORD spoke unto Moses and 
unto Aaron, saying: 18’Cut ye not off 
the tribe of the families of the 
Kohathites from among the Levites; 
19but thus do unto them, that they may 
live, and not die, when they approach 
unto the most holy things: Aaron and 
his sons shall go in, and appoint them 
every one to his service and to his 
burden; 20but they shall not go in to see 
the holy things as they are being 
covered, lest they die.’ 

 


 

 


21And the LORD spoke unto Moses 
saying: 22’Take the sum of the sons of 
Gershon also, by their fathers’houses, 
by their families; 23from thirty years 
old and upward until fifty years old 
shalt thou number them: all that enter 
in to wait upon the service, to do 
service in the tent of meeting. 24This is 
the service of the families of the 
Gershonites, in serving and in bearing 
burdens: 25they shall bear the curtains 
of the tabernacle, and the tent of 
meeting, its covering, and the covering 
of sealskin that is above upon it, and 
the screen for the door of the tent of 
meeting; 26and the hangings of the 
court, and the screen for the door of 
the gate of the court, which is by the 
tabernacle and by the altar round 
about, and their cords, and all the 
instruments of their service, and 
whatsoever there may be to do with 
them, therein shall they serve. 27At the 
commandment of Aaron and his sons 
shall be all the service of the sons of 
the Gershonites, in all their burden, 
and in all their service; and ye shall 
appoint unto them in charge all their 
burden. 28This is the service of the 
families of the sons of the Gershonites 
in the tent of meeting; and their charge 
shall be under the hand of Ithamar the 
son of Aaron the priest. 

29As for the sons of Merari, thou 
shalt number them by their families, 
by their fathers’houses; 30from thirty 
years old and upward even unto fifty 
years old shalt thou number them, 
every one that entereth upon the 
service, to do the work of the tent of 
meeting. 31And this is the charge of 
their burden, according to all their 
service in the tent of meeting: the 
boards of the tabernacle, and the bars 
thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the 
sockets thereof; 32and the pillars of the 
court round about, and their sockets, 
and their pins, and their cords, even all 
their appurtenance, and all that 
pertaineth to their service; and by 
name ye shall appoint the instruments 
of the charge of their burden. 33This is 
the service of the families of the sons 
of Merari, according to all their 
service, in the tent of meeting, under 
the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron 
the priest.’ 

34And Moses and Aaron and the 
princes of the congregation numbered 
the sons of the Kohathites by their 
families, and by their fathers’houses, 
35from thirty years old and upward 
even unto fifty years old, every one 
that entered upon the service, for 
service in the tent of meeting. 36And 
those that were numbered of them by 
their families were two thousand seven 
hundred and fifty. 37These are they that 
were numbered of the families of the 
Kohathites, of all that did serve in the 
tent of meeting, whom Moses and 
Aaron numbered according to the 
commandment of the LORD by the hand 
of Moses. 


38And those that were numbered of 
the sons of Gershon, by their families, 
and by their fathers’houses, 39from 
thirty years old and upward even unto 
fifty years old, every one that entered 
upon the service, for service in the tent 
of meeting, 40even those that were 
numbered of them, by their families, 
by their fathers’houses, were two 
thousand and six hundred and thirty. 
41These are they that were numbered 
of the families of the sons of Gershon, 
of all that did serve in the tent of 
meeting, whom Moses and Aaron 
numbered according to the 
commandment of the LORD. 

42And those that were numbered of 
the families of the sons of Merari, by 
their families, by their fathers’houses, 
43from thirty years old and upward 
even unto fifty years old, every one 
that entered upon the service, for 
service in the tent of meeting, 44even 
those that were numbered of them by 
their families, were three thousand and 
two hundred. 45These are they that 
were numbered of the families of the 
sons of Merari, whom Moses and 
Aaron numbered according to the 
commandment of the LORD by the hand 
of Moses. 

46All those that were numbered of 
the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron 
and the princes of Israel numbered, by 
their families, and by their 
fathers’houses, 47from thirty years old 
and upward even unto fifty years old, 
every one that entered in to do the 
work of service, and the work of 
bearing burdens in the tent of meeting, 
48even those that were numbered of 
them, were eight thousand and five 
hundred and fourscore. 49According to 
the commandment of the LORD they 
were appointed by the hand of Moses, 
every one to his service, and to his 
burden; they were also numbered, as 
the LORD commanded Moses. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 2’Command the children 
of Israel, that they put out of the camp 
every leper, and every one that hath an 
issue, and whosoever is unclean by the 
dead; 3both male and female shall ye 
put out, without the camp shall ye put 
them; that they defile not their camp, 
in the midst whereof I dwell.’ 4And the 
children of Israel did so, and put them 
out without the camp; as the LORD 
spoke unto Moses, so did the children 
of Israel. 

 

5And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 6Speak unto the children of 
Israel: 

When a man or woman shall 
commit any sin that men commit, to 
commit a trespass against the LORD, 
and that soul be guilty; 7then they shall 
confess their sin which they have 
done; and he shall make restitution for 
his guilt in full, and add unto it the 
fifth part thereof, and give it unto him 
in respect of whom he hath been 
guilty. 8But if the man have no 
kinsman to whom restitution may be 
made for the guilt, the restitution for 
5 




guilt which is made shall be the 
LORD’S, even the priest’s; besides the 
ram of the atonement, whereby 
atonement shall be made for him. 9And 
every heave-offering of all the holy 
things of the children of Israel, which 
they present unto the priest, shall be 
his. 10And every man’s hallowed 
things shall be his: whatsoever any 
man giveth the priest, it shall be his. 

 

11And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 12Speak unto the children of 
Israel, and say unto them: 

If any man’s wife go aside, and act 
unfaithfully against him, 13and a man 
lie with her carnally, and it be hid from 
the eyes of her husband, she being 
defiled secretly, and there be no 
witness against her, neither she be 
taken in the act; 14and the spirit of 
jealousy come upon him, and he be 
jealous of his wife, and she be defiled; 
or if the spirit of jealousy come upon 
him, and he be jealous of his wife, and 
she be not defiled; 15then shall the man 
bring his wife unto the priest, and shall 
bring her offering for her, the tenth 
part of an ephah of barley meal; he 
shall pour no oil upon it, nor put 
frankincense thereon; for it is a meal-
offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of 
memorial, bringing iniquity to 
remembrance. 16And the priest shall 
bring her near, and set her before the 
LORD. 17And the priest shall take holy 
water in an earthen vessel; and of the 
dust that is on the floor of the 
tabernacle the priest shall take, and put 
it into the water. 18And the priest shall 
set the woman before the LORD, and let 
the hair of the woman’s head go loose, 
and put the meal-offering of memorial 
in her hands, which is the meal-
offering of jealousy; and the priest 
shall have in his hand the water of 
bitterness that causeth the curse. 19And 
the priest shall cause her to swear, and 
shall say unto the woman: ‘If no man 
have lain with thee, and if thou hast 
not gone aside to uncleanness, being 
under thy husband, be thou free from 
this water of bitterness that causeth the 
curse; 20but if thou hast gone aside, 
being under thy husband, and if thou 
be defiled, and some man have lain 
with thee besides thy husband— 21then 
the priest shall cause the woman to 
swear with the oath of cursing, and the 
priest shall say unto the woman—the 
LORD make thee a curse and an oath 
among thy people, when the LORD doth 
make thy thigh to fall away, and thy 
belly to swell; 22and this water that 
causeth the curse shall go into thy 
bowels, and make thy belly to swell, 
and thy thigh to fall away’; and the 
woman shall say: ‘Amen, Amen.’ 
23And the priest shall write these 
curses in a scroll, and he shall blot 
them out into the water of bitterness. 
24And he shall make the woman drink 
the water of bitterness that causeth the 
curse; and the water that causeth the 
curse shall enter into her and become 
bitter. 25And the priest shall take the 
meal-offering of jealousy out of the 
woman’s hand, and shall wave the 


meal-offering before the LORD, and 
bring it unto the altar. 26And the priest 
shall take a handful of the meal-
offering, as the memorial-part thereof, 
and make it smoke upon the altar, and 
afterward shall make the woman drink 
the water. 27And when he hath made 
her drink the water, then it shall come 
to pass, if she be defiled, and have 
acted unfaithfully against her husband, 
that the water that causeth the curse 
shall enter into her and become bitter, 
and her belly shall swell, and her thigh 
shall fall away; and the woman shall 
be a curse among her people. 28And if 
the woman be not defiled, but be 
clean; then she shall be cleared, and 
shall conceive seed. 29This is the law 
of jealousy, when a wife, being under 
her husband, goeth aside, and is 
defiled; 30or when the spirit of jealousy 
cometh upon a man, and he be jealous 
over his wife; then shall he set the 
woman before the LORD, and the priest 
shall execute upon her all this law. 
31And the man shall be clear from 
iniquity, and that woman shall bear her 
iniquity. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 2Speak unto the children 
of Israel, and say unto them: 

When either man or woman shall 
clearly utter a vow, the vow of a 
Nazirite, to consecrate himself unto 
the LORD, 3he shall abstain from wine 
and strong drink: he shall drink no 
vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong 
drink, neither shall he drink any liquor 
of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried. 
4All the days of his Naziriteship shall 
he eat nothing that is made of the 
grape-vine, from the pressed grapes 
even to the grapestone. 5All the days of 
his vow of Naziriteship there shall no 
razor come upon his head; until the 
days be fulfilled, in which he 
consecrateth himself unto the LORD, he 
shall be holy, he shall let the locks of 
the hair of his head grow long. 6All the 
days that he consecrateth himself unto 
the LORD he shall not come near to a 
dead body. 7He shall not make himself 
unclean for his father, or for his 
mother, for his brother, or for his 
sister, when they die; because his 
consecration unto God is upon his 
head. 8All the days of his Naziriteship 
he is holy unto the LORD. 9And if any 
man die very suddenly beside him, and 
he defile his consecrated head, then he 
shall shave his head in the day of his 
cleansing, on the seventh day shall he 
shave it. 10And on the eighth day he 
shall bring two turtledoves, or two 
young pigeons, to the priest, to the 
door of the tent of meeting. 11And the 
priest shall prepare one for a sin-
offering, and the other for a burnt-
offering, and make atonement for him, 
for that he sinned by reason of the 
dead; and he shall hallow his head that 
same day. 12And he shall consecrate 
unto the LORD the days of his 
Naziriteship, and shall bring a he-lamb 
of the first year for a guilt-offering; but 
the former days shall be void, because 
his consecration was defiled. 
6 




13And this is the law of the Nazirite, 
when the days of his consecration are 
fulfilled: he shall abring it unto the 
door of the tent of meeting; 14and he 
shall present his offering unto the 
LORD, one he-lamb of the first year 
without blemish for a burnt-offering, 
and one ewe-lamb of the first year 
without blemish for a sin-offering, and 
one ram without blemish for peace-
offerings, 15and a basket of unleavened 
bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with 
oil, and unleavened wafers spread with 
oil, and their meal-offering, and their 
drink-offerings. 16And the priest shall 
bring them before the LORD, and shall 
offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-
offering. 17And he shall offer the ram 
for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto 
the LORD, with the basket of 
unleavened bread; the priest shall offer 
also the meal-offering thereof, and the 
drink-offering thereof. 18And the 
Nazirite shall shave his consecrated 
head at the door of the tent of meeting, 
and shall take the hair of his 
consecrated head, and put it on the fire 
which is under the sacrifice of peace-
offerings. 19And the priest shall take 
the shoulder of the ram when it is 
sodden, and one unleavened cake out 
of the basket, and one unleavened 
wafer, and shall put them upon the 
hands of the Nazirite, after he hath 
shaven his consecrated head. 20And the 

a That is, bring his consecrated head 
(come with his consecrated hair 
unshaven). 

priest shall wave them for a wave-
offering before the LORD; this is holy 
for the priest, together with the breast 
of waving and the thigh of heaving; 
and after that the Nazirite may drink 
wine. 21This is the law of the Nazirite 
who voweth, and of his offering unto 
the LORD for his Naziriteship, beside 
that for which his means suffice; 
according to his vow which he voweth, 
so he must do after the law of his 
Naziriteship. 

 

22And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 23’Speak unto Aaron and unto 
his sons, saying: On this wise ye shall 
bless the children of Israel; ye shall 
say unto them: 

24The LORD bless thee, and keep 
thee; 

25The LORD make His face to shine 
upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; 

26The LORD lift up His countenance 
upon thee, and give thee peace. 

27So shall they put My name upon 
the children of Israel, and I will bless 
them.’ 

 

And it came to pass on the day 
that Moses had made an end of 
setting up the tabernacle, and had 
anointed it and sanctified it, and all the 
furniture thereof, and the altar and all 
the vessels thereof, and had anointed 
them and sanctified them; 2that the 
princes of Israel, the heads of their 
fathers’houses, offered—these were 
the princes of the tribes, these are they 
that were over them that were 
7 




numbered. 3And they brought their 
offering before the LORD, six covered 
wagons, and twelve oxen: a wagon for 
every two of the princes, and for each 
one an ox; and they presented them 
before the tabernacle. 4And the LORD 
spoke unto Moses, saying: 5’Take it of 
them, that they may be to do the 
service of the tent of meeting; and thou 
shalt give them unto the Levites, to 
every man according to his service.’ 
6And Moses took the wagons and the 
oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 
7Two wagons and four oxen he gave 
unto the sons of Gershon, according to 
their service. 8And four wagons and 
eight oxen he gave unto the sons of 
Merari, according unto their service, 
under the hand of Ithamar the son of 
Aaron the priest. 9But unto the sons of 
Kohath he gave none, because the 
service of the holy things belonged 
unto them: they bore them upon their 
shoulders. 10And the princes brought 
the dedication-offering of the altar in 
the day that it was anointed, even the 
princes brought their offering before 
the altar. 11And the LORD said unto 
Moses: ‘They shall present their 
offering each prince on his day, for the 
dedication of the altar.’ 

12And he that presented his offering 
the first day was Nahshon the son of 
Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah; 
13and his offering was one silver dish,

thirty shekels, one silver basin of

the tent of meeting that He might 
speak with him, then he heard the 
Voice speaking unto him from above 
the ark-cover that was upon the ark of 
the testimony, from between the two 
cherubim; and He spoke unto him. 

 


And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 2’Speak unto Aaron, and 
say unto him: When thou lightest the 
lamps, the seven lamps shall give light 
in front of the candlestick.’ 3And 
Aaron did so: he lighted the lamps 
thereof so as to give light in front of 
the candlestick, as the LORD 
commanded Moses. 4And this was the 
work of the candlestick, beaten work 
of gold; unto the base thereof, and 
unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten 
work; according unto the pattern 
which the LORD had shown Moses, so 
he made the candlestick. 

5And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 6’Take the Levites from among 
the children of Israel, and cleanse 
them. 7And thus shalt thou do unto 
them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the 
water of purification upon them, and 
let them cause a razor to pass over all 
their flesh, and let them wash their 
clothes, and cleanse themselves. 8Then 
let them take a young bullock, and its 
meal-offering, fine flour mingled with 
oil, and another young bullock shalt 
thou take for a sin-offering. 9And thou 
shalt present the Levites before the 
8 




tent of meeting; and thou shalt 
assemble the whole congregation of 
the children of Israel. 10And thou shalt 
present the Levites before the LORD; 
and the children of Israel shall lay their 
hands upon the Levites. 11And Aaron 
shall offer the Levites before the LORD 
for a wave-offering from the children 
of Israel, that they may be to do the 
service of the LORD. 12And the Levites 
shall lay their hands upon the heads of 
the bullocks; and offer thou the one for 
a sin-offering, and the other for a 
burnt-offering, unto the LORD, to make 
atonement for the Levites. 13And thou 
shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and 
before his sons, and offer them for a 
wave-offering unto the LORD. 14Thus 
shalt thou separate the Levites from 
among the children of Israel; and the 
Levites shall be Mine. 15And after that 
shall the Levites go in to do the service 
of the tent of meeting; and thou shalt 
cleanse them, and offer them for a 
wave-offering. 16For they are wholly 
given unto Me from among the 
children of Israel; instead of all that 
openeth the womb, even the first-born 
of all the children of Israel, have I 
taken them unto Me. 17For all the first-
born among the children of Israel are 
Mine, both man and beast; on the day 
that I smote all the first-born in the 
land of Egypt I sanctified them for 
Myself. 18And I have taken the Levites 
instead of all the first-born among the 
children of Israel. 19And I have given 
the Levites— they are given to Aaron 
and to his sons from among the 
children of Israel, to do the service of 
the children of Israel in the tent of 
meeting, and to make atonement for 
the children of Israel, that there be no 
plague among the children of Israel, 
through the children of Israel coming 
nigh unto the sanctuary.’ 20Thus did 
Moses, and Aaron, and all the 
congregation of the children of Israel, 
unto the Levites; according unto all 
that the LORD commanded Moses 
touching the Levites, so did the 
children of Israel unto them. 21And the 
Levites purified themselves, and they 
washed their clothes; and Aaron 
offered them for a sacred gift before 
the LORD; and Aaron made atonement 
for them to cleanse them. 22And after 
that went the Levites in to do their 
service in the tent of meeting before 
Aaron, and before his sons; as the 
LORD had commanded Moses 
concerning the Levites, so did they 
unto them. 

23And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 24’This is that which pertaineth 
unto the Levites: from twenty and five 
years old and upward they shall go in 
to perform the service in the work of 
the tent of meeting; 25and from the age 
of fifty years they shall return from the 
service of the work, and shall serve no 
more; 26but shall minister with their 
brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep 
the charge, but they shall do no 
manner of service. Thus shalt thou do 
unto the Levites touching their 
charges.’ 




And the LORD spoke unto Moses 
in the wilderness of Sinai, in the 
first month of the second year after 
they were come out of the land of 
Egypt, saying: 2’Let the children of 
Israel keep the passover in its 
appointed season. 3In the fourteenth 
day of this month, at dusk, ye shall 
keep it in its appointed season; 
according to all the statutes of it, and 
according to all the ordinances thereof, 
shall ye keep it.’ 4And Moses spoke 
unto the children of Israel, that they 
should keep the passover. 5And they 
kept the passover in the first month, on 
the fourteenth day of the month, at 
dusk, in the wilderness of Sinai; 
according to all that the LORD 
commanded Moses, so did the children 
of Israel. 6But there were certain men, 
who were unclean by the dead body of 
a man, so that they could not keep the 
passover on that day; and they came 
before Moses and before Aaron on that 
day. 7And those men said unto him: 
‘We are unclean by the dead body of a 
man; wherefore are we to be kept 
back, so as not to bring the offering of 
the LORD in its appointed season 
among the children of Israel?’ 8And 
Moses said unto them: ‘Stay ye, that I 
may hear what the LORD will command 
concerning you.’ 

9And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 10’Speak unto the children of 
Israel, saying: If any man of you or of 
your generations shall be unclean by 
reason of a dead body, or be in a 
journey afar off, yet he shall keep the 
passover unto the LORD; 11in the 
second month on the fourteenth day at 
dusk they shall keep it; they shall eat it 
with unleavened bread and bitter 
herbs; 12they shall leave none of it unto 
the morning, nor break a bone thereof; 
according to all the statute of the 
passover they shall keep it. 13But the 
man that is clean, and is not on a 
journey, and forbeareth to keep the 
passover, that soul shall be cut off 
from his people; because he brought 
not the offering of the LORD in its 
appointed season, that man shall bear 
his sin. 14And if a stranger shall 
sojourn among you, and will keep the 
passover unto the LORD: according to 
the statute of the passover, and 
according to the ordinance thereof, so 
shall he do; ye shall have one statute, 
both for the stranger, and for him that 
is born in the land.’ 

 

15And on the day that the tabernacle 
was reared up the cloud covered the 
tabernacle, even the tent of the 
testimony; and at even there was upon 
the tabernacle as it were the 
appearance of fire, until morning. 16So 
it was alway: the cloud covered it, and 
the appearance of fire by night. 17And 
whenever the cloud was taken up from 
over the Tent, then after that the 
children of Israel journeyed; and in the 
place where the cloud abode, there the 
children of Israel encamped. 18At the 
commandment of the LORD the 
children of Israel journeyed, and at the 
commandment of the LORD they 
9 




encamped: as long as the cloud abode 
upon the tabernacle they remained 
encamped. 19And when the cloud 
tarried upon the tabernacle many days, 
then the children of Israel kept the 
charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. 
20And sometimes the cloud was a few 
days upon the tabernacle; according to 
the commandment of the LORD they 
remained encamped, and according to 
the commandment of the LORD they 
journeyed. 21And sometimes the cloud 
was from evening until morning; and 
when the cloud was taken up in the 
morning, they journeyed; or if it 
continued by day and by night, when 
the cloud was taken up, they 
journeyed. 22Whether it were two days, 
or a month, or a year, that the cloud 
tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding 
thereon, the children of Israel 
remained encamped, and journeyed 
not; but when it was taken up, they 
journeyed. 23At the commandment of 
the LORD they encamped, and at the 
commandment of the LORD they 
journeyed; they kept the charge of the 
LORD, at the commandment of the 
LORD by the hand of Moses. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2’Make thee 
two trumpets of silver; of beaten work 
shalt thou make them; and they shall 
be unto thee for the calling of the 
congregation, and for causing the 
camps to set forward. 3And when they 
shall blow with them, all the 
congregation shall gather themselves 
unto thee at the door of the tent of 
meeting. 4And if they blow but with 
one, then the princes, the heads of the 
thousands of Israel, shall gather 
themselves unto thee. 5And when ye 
blow an alarm, the camps that lie on 
the east side shall take their journey. 
6And when ye blow an alarm the 
second time, the camps that lie on the 
south side shall set forward; they shall 
blow an alarm for their journeys. 7But 
when the assembly is to be gathered 
together, ye shall blow, but ye shall 
not sound an alarm. 8And the sons of 
Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the 
trumpets; and they shall be to you for a 
statute for ever throughout your 
generations. 9And when ye go to war 
in your land against the adversary that 
oppresseth you, then ye shall sound an 
alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall 
be remembered before the LORD your 
God, and ye shall be saved from your 
enemies. 10Also in the day of your 
gladness, and in your appointed 
seasons, and in your new moons, ye 
shall blow with the trumpets over your 
burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices 
of your peace-offerings; and they shall 
be to you for a memorial before your 
God: I am the LORD your God.’ 

 

11And it came to pass in the second 
year, in the second month, on the 
twentieth day of the month, that the 
cloud was taken up from over the 
tabernacle of the testimony. 12And the 
children of Israel set forward by their 
stages out of the wilderness of Sinai; 
10 




and the cloud abode in the wilderness 
of Paran.—13And they took their first 
journey, according to the 
commandment of the LORD by the hand 
of Moses. 14And in the first place the 
standard of the camp of the children of 
Judah set forward according to their 
hosts; and over his host was Nahshon 
the son of Amminadab. 15And over the 
host of the tribe of the children of 
Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar. 
16And over the host of the tribe of the 
children of Zebulun was Eliab the son 
of Helon. 17And the tabernacle was 
taken down; and the sons of Gershon 
and the sons of Merari, who bore the 
tabernacle, set forward. 18And the 
standard of the camp of Reuben set 
forward according to their hosts; and 
over his host was Elizur the son of 
Shedeur. 19And over the host of the 
tribe of the children of Simeon was 
Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 
20And over the host of the tribe of the 
children of Gad was Eliasaph the son 
of Deuel. 21And the Kohathites the 
bearers of the sanctuary set forward, 
that the tabernacle might be set up 
against their coming. 22And the 
standard of the camp of the children of 
Ephraim set forward according to their 
hosts; and over his host was Elishama 
the son of Ammihud. 23And over the 
host of the tribe of the children of 
Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of 
Pedahzur. 24And over the host of the 
tribe of the children of Benjamin was 
Abidan the son of Gideoni. 25And the 
standard of the camp of the children of 
Dan, which was the rearward of all the 
camps, set forward according to their 
hosts; and over his host was Ahiezer 
the son of Ammishaddai. 26And over 
the host of the tribe of the children of 
Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran. 
27And over the host of the tribe of the 
children of Naphtali was Ahira the son 
of Enan. 28Thus were the journeyings 
of the children of Israel according to 
their hosts.—And they set forward. 

29And Moses said unto Hobab, the 
son of Reuel the Midianite, 
Moses’father-in-law: ‘We are 
journeying unto the place of which the 
LORD said: I will give it you; come 
thou with us, and we will do thee 
good; for the LORD hath spoken good 
concerning Israel.’ 30And he said unto 
him: ‘I will not go; but I will depart to 
mine own land, and to my kindred.’ 
31And he said: ‘Leave us not, I pray 
thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how 
we are to encamp in the wilderness, 
and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes. 
32And it shall be, if thou go with us, 
yea, it shall be, that what good soever 
the LORD shall do unto us, the same 
will we do unto thee.’ 

33And they set forward from the 
mount of the LORD three days’journey; 
and the ark of the covenant of the LORD 
went before them three days’journey, 
to seek out a resting-place for them. 
34And the cloud of the LORD was over 
them by day, when they set forward 
from the camp. 

35And it came to pass, when the ark 
set forward, that Moses said: ‘Rise up, 


O LORD, and let Thine enemies be 
scattered; and let them that hate Thee 
flee before Thee.’ 36And when it 
rested, he said: ‘Return, O LORD, unto 
the ten thousands of the families of 
Israel.’ 

And the people were as 
murmurers, speaking evil in 
the ears of the LORD; and when the 
LORD heard it, His anger was kindled; 
and the fire of the LORD burnt among 
them, and devoured in the uttermost 
part of the camp. 2And the people cried 
unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto 
the LORD, and the fire abated. 3And the 
name of that place was called 
aTaberah, because the fire of the LORD 
burnt among them. 

a That is, Burning. 

4And the mixed multitude that was 
among them fell a lusting; and the 
children of Israel also wept on their 
part, and said: ‘Would that we were 
given flesh to eat! 5We remember the 
fish, which we were wont to eat in 
Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and 
the melons, and the leeks, and the 
onions, and the garlic; 6but now our 
soul is dried away; there is nothing at 
all; we have nought save this manna to 
look to.’—7Now the manna was like 
coriander seed, and the appearance 
thereof as the appearance of bdellium. 
8The people went about, and gathered 
it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in 
mortars, and seethed it in pots, and 
made cakes of it; and the taste of it 
was as the taste of a cake baked with 

oil. 9And when the dew fell upon the 
camp in the night, the manna fell upon 
it.—10And Moses heard the people 
weeping, family by family, every man 
at the door of his tent; and the anger of 
the LORD was kindled greatly; and 
Moses was displeased. 11And Moses 
said unto the LORD: ‘Wherefore hast 
Thou dealt ill with Thy servant? and 
wherefore have I not found favour in 
Thy sight, that Thou layest the burden 
of all this people upon me? 12Have I 
conceived all this people? have I 
brought them forth, that Thou 
shouldest say unto me: Carry them in 
thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth 
the sucking child, unto the land which 
Thou didst swear unto their fathers? 
13Whence should I have flesh to give 
unto all this people? for they trouble 
me with their weeping, saying: Give us 
flesh, that we may eat. 14I am not able 
to bear all this people myself alone, 
because it is too heavy for me. 15And if 
Thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray 
Thee, out of hand, if I have found 
favour in Thy sight; and let me not 
look upon my wretchedness.’ 

16And the LORD said unto Moses: 
‘Gather unto Me seventy men of the 
elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to 
be the elders of the people, and 
officers over them; and bring them 
unto the tent of meeting, that they may 
stand there with thee. 17And I will 
come down and speak with thee there; 
and I will take of the spirit which is 
upon thee, and will put it upon them; 
and they shall bear the burden of the 
11 




people with thee, that thou bear it not 
thyself alone. 18And say thou unto the 
people: Sanctify yourselves against to-
morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye 
have wept in the ears of the LORD, 
saying: Would that we were given 
flesh to eat! for it was well with us in 
Egypt; therefore the LORD will give 
you flesh, and ye shall eat. 19Ye shall 
not eat one day, nor two days, nor five 
days, neither ten days, nor twenty 
days; 20but a whole month, until it 
come out at your nostrils, and it be 
loathsome unto you; because that ye 
have rejected the LORD who is among 
you, and have troubled Him with 
weeping, saying: Why, now, came we 
forth out of Egypt?’ 21And Moses said: 
‘The people, among whom I am, are 
six hundred thousand men on foot; and 
yet Thou hast said: I will give them 
flesh, that they may eat a whole 
month! 22If flocks and herds be slain 
for them, will they suffice them? or if 
all the fish of the sea be gathered 
together for them, will they suffice 
them?’ 23And the LORD said unto 
Moses: ‘Is the LORD’S hand waxed 
short? now shalt thou see whether My 
word shall come to pass unto thee or 
not.’ 

24And Moses went out, and told the 
people the words of the LORD; and he 
gathered seventy men of the elders of 
the people, and set them round about 
the Tent. 25And the LORD came down 
in the cloud, and spoke unto him, and 
took of the spirit that was upon him, 
and put it upon the seventy elders; and 
it came to pass, that, when the spirit 
rested upon them, they prophesied, but 
they did so no more. 26But there 
remained two men in the camp, the 
name of the one was Eldad, and the 
name of the other Medad; and the 
spirit rested upon them; and they were 
of them that were recorded, but had 
not gone out unto the Tent; and they 
prophesied in the camp. 27And there 
ran a young man, and told Moses, and 
said: ‘Eldad and Medad are 
prophesying in the camp.’ 28And 
Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of 
Moses from his youth up, answered 
and said: ‘My lord Moses, shut them 
in.’ 29And Moses said unto him: ‘Art 
thou jealous for my sake? would that 
all the LORD’S people were prophets, 
that the LORD would put His spirit 
upon them! ’ 30And Moses withdrew 
into the camp, he and the elders of 
Israel. 

31And there went forth a wind from 
the LORD, and brought across quails 
from the sea, and let them fall by the 
camp, about a day’s journey on this 
side, and a day’s journey on the other 
side, round about the camp, and about 
two cubits above the face of the earth. 
32And the people rose up all that day, 
and all the night, and all the next day, 
and gathered the quails; he that 
gathered least gathered ten heaps; and 
they spread them all abroad for 
themselves round about the camp. 
33While the flesh was yet between their 
teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of 
the LORD was kindled against the 


people, and the LORD smote the people 
with a very great plague. 34And the 
name of that place was called Kibroth-
hattaavah, because there they buried 
the people that lusted. 35From 
aKibroth-hattaavah the people 
journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they 
abode at Hazeroth. 

a That is, The graves of lust. 

And Miriam and Aaron spoke 
against Moses because of the 
Cushite woman whom he had married; 
for he had married a Cushite woman. 
2And they said: ‘Hath the LORD indeed 
spoken only with Moses? hath He not 
spoken also with us?’ And the LORD 
heard it.— 3Now the man Moses was 
very meek, above all the men that 
were upon the face of the earth.— 
4And the LORD spoke suddenly unto 
Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto 
Miriam: ‘Come out ye three unto the 
tent of meeting.’ And they three came 
out. 5And the LORD came down in a 
pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of 
the Tent, and called Aaron and 
Miriam; and they both came forth. 
6And He said: ‘Hear now My words: if 
there be a prophet among you, I the 
LORD do make Myself known unto him 
in a vision, I do speak with him in a 
dream. 7My servant Moses is not so; 
he is trusted in all My house; 8with 
him do I speak mouth to mouth, even 
manifestly, and not in dark speeches; 
and the similitude of the LORD doth he 
behold; wherefore then were ye not 
afraid to speak against My servant, 

against Moses?’ 9And the anger of the 
LORD was kindled against them; and 
He departed. 10And when the cloud 
was removed from over the Tent, 
behold, Miriam was leprous, as white 
as snow; and Aaron looked upon 
Miriam; and, behold, she was leprous. 
11And Aaron said unto Moses: ‘Oh my 
lord, lay not, I pray thee, sin upon us, 
for that we have done foolishly, and 
for that we have sinned. 12Let her not, I 
pray, be as one dead, of whom the 
flesh is half consumed when he 
cometh out of his mother’s womb.’ 
13And Moses cried unto the LORD, 
saying: ‘Heal her now, O God, I 
beseech Thee.’ 

14And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘If 
her father had but spit in her face, 
should she not hide in shame seven 
days? let her be shut up without the 
camp seven days, and after that she 
shall be brought in again.’ 15And 
Miriam was shut up without the camp 
seven days; and the people journeyed 
not till Miriam was brought in again. 
16And afterward the people journeyed 
from Hazeroth, and pitched in the 
wilderness of Paran. 

 


And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2’Send thou 
men, that they may spy out the land of 
Canaan, which I give unto the children 
of Israel; of every tribe of their fathers 
shall ye send a man, every one a prince 
among them.’ 3And Moses sent them 
from the wilderness of Paran 
12 

13 




according to the commandment of the 
LORD; all of them men who were heads 
of the children of Israel. 4And these 
were their names: of the tribe of 
Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. 
5Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the 
son of Hori. 6Of the tribe of Judah, 
Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 7Of the 
tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of 
Joseph. 8Of the tribe of Ephraim, 
Hoshea the son of Nun. 9Of the tribe of 
Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 10Of 
the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son 
of Sodi. 11Of the tribe of Joseph, 
namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, 
Gaddi the son of Susi. 12Of the tribe of 
Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 13Of 
the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of 
Michael. 14Of the tribe of Naphtali, 
Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 15Of the tribe 
of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
16These are the names of the men that 
Moses sent to spy out the land. And 
Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun 
Joshua. 17And Moses sent them to spy 
out the land of Canaan, and said unto 
them: ‘Get you up here into the South, 
and go up into the mountains; 18and 
see the land, what it is; and the people 
that dwelleth therein, whether they are 
strong or weak, whether they are few 
or many; 19and what the land is that 
they dwell in, whether it is good or 
bad; and what cities they are that they 
dwell in, whether in camps, or in 
strongholds; 20and what the land is, 
whether it is fat or lean, whether there 
is wood therein, or not. And be ye of 
good courage, and bring of the fruit of 
the land.’—Now the time was the time 
of the first-ripe grapes.— 21So they 
went up, and spied out the land from 
the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, at 
the entrance to Hamath. 22And they 
went up into the South, and came unto 
Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and 
Talmai, the children of Anak, were 
there.—Now Hebron was built seven 
years before Zoan in Egypt.— 23And 
they came unto the valley of Eshcol, 
and cut down from thence a branch 
with one cluster of grapes, and they 
bore it upon a pole between two; they 
took also of the pomegranates, and of 
the figs.— 24That place was called the 
valley of aEshcol, because of the 
cluster which the children of Israel cut 
down from thence.— 25And they 
returned from spying out the land at 
the end of forty days. 26And they went 
and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and 
to all the congregation of the children 
of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, 
to Kadesh; and brought back word 
unto them, and unto all the 
congregation, and showed them the 
fruit of the land. 27And they told him, 
and said: ‘We came unto the land 
whither thou sentest us, and surely it 
floweth with milk and honey; and this 
is the fruit of it. 28Howbeit the people 
that dwell in the land are fierce, and 
the cities are fortified, and very great; 
and moreover we saw the children of 
Anak there. 29Amalek dwelleth in the 
land of the South; and the Hittite, and 

a That is, a cluster. 


the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in 
the mountains; and the Canaanite 
dwelleth by the sea, and along by the 
side of the Jordan.’ 30And Caleb stilled 
the people toward Moses, and said: 
‘We should go up at once, and possess 
it; for we are well able to overcome it.’ 
31But the men that went up with him 
said: ‘We are not able to go up against 
the people; for they are stronger than 
we.’ 32And they spread an evil report 
of the land which they had spied out 
unto the children of Israel, saying: 
‘The land, through which we have 
passed to spy it out, is a land that 
eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and 
all the people that we saw in it are men 
of great stature. 33And there we saw 
the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who 
come of the Nephilim; and we were in 
our own sight as grasshoppers, and so 
we were in their sight.’ 

And all the congregation lifted 
up their voice, and cried; and 
the people wept that night. 2And all the 
children of Israel murmured against 
Moses and against Aaron; and the 
whole congregation said unto them: 
‘Would that we had died in the land of 
Egypt! or would we had died in this 
wilderness! 3And wherefore doth the 
LORD bring us unto this land, to fall by 
the sword? Our wives and our little 
ones will be a prey; were it not better 
for us to return into Egypt?’ 4And they 
said one to another: ‘Let us make a 
captain, and let us return into Egypt.’ 
5Then Moses and Aaron fell on their 
faces before all the assembly of the 
congregation of the children of Israel. 
6And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb 
the son of Jephunneh, who were of 
them that spied out the land, rent their 
clothes. 7And they spoke unto all the 
congregation of the children of Israel, 
saying: ‘The land, which we passed 
through to spy it out, is an exceeding 
good land. 8If the LORD delight in us, 
then He will bring us into this land, 
and give it unto us—a land which 
floweth with milk and honey. 9Only 
rebel not against the LORD, neither fear 
ye the people of the land; for they are 
bread for us; their defence is removed 
from over them, and the LORD is with 
us; fear them not.’ 10But all the 
congregation bade stone them with 
stones, when the glory of the LORD 
appeared in the tent of meeting unto all 
the children of Israel. 

11And the LORD said unto Moses: 
‘How long will this people despise 
Me? and how long will they not 
believe in Me, for all the signs which I 
have wrought among them? 12I will 
smite them with the pestilence, and 
destroy them, and will make of thee a 
nation greater and mightier than they.’ 
13And Moses said unto the LORD: 
‘When the Egyptians shall hear—for 
Thou broughtest up this people in Thy 
might from among them—14they will 
say to the inhabitants of this land, who 
have heard that Thou LORD art in the 
midst of this people; inasmuch as 
Thou LORD art seen face to face, and 
Thy cloud standeth over them, and 
Thou goest before them, in a pillar of 
14 




cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by 
night; 15now if Thou shalt kill this 
people as one man, then the nations 
which have heard the fame of Thee 
will speak, saying: 16Because the LORD 
was not able to bring this people into 
the land which He swore unto them, 
therefore He hath slain them in the 
wilderness. 17And now, I pray Thee, 
let the power of the Lord be great, 
according as Thou hast spoken, 
saying: 18The LORD is slow to anger, 
and plenteous in lovingkindness, 
forgiving iniquity and transgression, 
and that will by no means clear the 
guilty; visiting the iniquity of the 
fathers upon the children, upon the 
third and upon the fourth generation. 
19Pardon, I pray Thee, the iniquity of 
this people according unto the 
greatness of Thy lovingkindness, and 
according as Thou hast forgiven this 
people, from Egypt even until now.’ 
20And the LORD said: ‘I have pardoned 
according to thy word’21But in very 
deed, as I live—and all the earth shall 
be filled with the glory of the LORD— 
22surely all those men that have seen 
My glory, and My signs, which I 
wrought in Egypt and in the 
wilderness, yet have put Me to proof 
these ten times, and have not 
hearkened to My voice; 23surely they 
shall not see the land which I swore 
unto their fathers, neither shall any of 
them that despised Me see it. 24But My 
servant Caleb, because he had another 
spirit with him, and hath followed Me 
fully, him will I bring into the land 
whereinto he went; and his seed shall 
possess it. 25Now the Amalekite and 
the Canaanite dwell in the Vale; 
tomorrow turn ye, and get you into the 
wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.’ 

26And the LORD spoke unto Moses 
and unto Aaron, saying: 27’How long 
shall I bear with this evil congregation, 
that keep murmuring against Me? I 
have heard the murmurings of the 
children of Israel, which they keep 
murmuring against Me. 28Say unto 
them: As I live, saith the LORD, surely 
as ye have spoken in Mine ears, so will 
I do to you: 29your carcasses shall fall 
in this wilderness, and all that were 
numbered of you, according to your 
whole number, from twenty years old 
and upward, ye that have murmured 
against Me; 30surely ye shall not come 
into the land, concerning which I lifted 
up My hand that I would make you 
dwell therein, save Caleb the son of 
Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
31But your little ones, that ye said 
would be a prey, them will I bring in, 
and they shall know the land which ye 
have rejected. 32But as for you, your 
carcasses shall fall in this wilderness. 
33And your children shall be wanderers 
in the wilderness forty years, and shall 
bear your strayings, until your 
carcasses be consumed in the 
wilderness. 34After the number of the 
days in which ye spied out the land, 
even forty days, for every day a year, 
shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty 
years, and ye shall know My 
displeasure. 35I the LORD have spoken, 


surely this will I do unto all this evil 
congregation, that are gathered 
together against Me; in this wilderness 
they shall be consumed, and there they 
shall die.’ 36And the men, whom 
Moses sent to spy out the land, and 
who, when they returned, made all the 
congregation to murmur against him, 
by bringing up an evil report against 
the land, 37even those men that did 
bring up an evil report of the land, died 
by the plague before the LORD. 38But 
Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the 
son of Jephunneh, remained alive of 
those men that went to spy out the 
land. 39And Moses told these words 
unto all the children of Israel; and the 
people mourned greatly. 40And they 
rose up early in the morning, and got 
them up to the top of the mountain, 
saying: ‘Lo, we are here, and will go 
up unto the place which the LORD hath 
promised; for we have sinned.’ 41And 
Moses said: ‘Wherefore now do ye 
transgress the commandment of the 
LORD, seeing it shall not prosper? 42Go 
not up, for the LORD is not among you; 
that ye be not smitten down before 
your enemies. 43For there the 
Amalekite and the Canaanite are 
before you, and ye shall fall by the 
sword; forasmuch as ye are turned 
back from following the LORD, and the 
LORD will not be with you.’ 44But they 
presumed to go up to the top of the 
mountain; nevertheless the ark of the 
covenant of the LORD, and Moses, 
departed not out of the camp. 45Then 
the Amalekite and the Canaanite, who 
dwelt in that hill-country, came down, 
and smote them and beat them down, 
even unto Hormah. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2Speak unto 
the children of Israel, and say unto 
them: 

When ye are come into the land of 
your habitations, which I give unto 
you, 3and will make an offering by fire 
unto the LORD, a burnt-offering, or a 
sacrifice, in fulfilment of a vow clearly 
uttered, or as a freewill-offering, or in 
your appointed seasons, to make a 
sweet savour unto the LORD, of the 
herd, or of the flock; 4then shall he that 
bringeth his offering present unto the 
LORD a meal-offering of a tenth part of 
an ephah of fine flour mingled with the 
fourth part of a hin of oil; 5and wine 
for the drink-offering, the fourth part 
of a hin, shalt thou prepare with the 
burnt-offering or for the sacrifice, for 
each lamb. 6Or for a ram, thou shalt 
prepare for a meal-offering two tenth 
parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled 
with the third part of a hin of oil; 7and 
for the drink-offering thou shalt 
present the third part of a hin of wine, 
of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 8And 
when thou preparest a bullock for a 
burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice, in 
fulfilment of a vow clearly uttered, or 
for peace-offerings unto the LORD; 
9then shall there be presented with the 
bullock a meal-offering of three tenth 
parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled 
with half a hin of oil. 10And thou shalt 
15 




present for the drink-offering half a 
hin of wine, for an offering made by 
fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
11Thus shall it be done for each 
bullock, or for each ram, or for each of 
the he-lambs, or of the kids. 
12According to the number that ye may 
prepare, so shall ye do for every one 
according to their number. 13All that 
are home-born shall do these things 
after this manner, in presenting an 
offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savour unto the LORD. 14And if a 
stranger sojourn with you, or 
whosoever may be among you, 
throughout your generations, and will 
offer an offering made by fire, of a 
sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, 
so he shall do. 15As for the 
congregation, there shall be one statute 
both for you, and for the stranger that 
sojourneth with you, a statute for ever 
throughout your generations; as ye are, 
so shall the stranger be before the 
LORD. 16One law and one ordinance 
shall be both for you, and for the 
stranger that sojourneth with you. 

 

17And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 18Speak unto the children of 
Israel, and say unto them: 

When ye come into the land whither 
I bring you, 19then it shall be, that, 
when ye eat of the bread of the land, 
ye shall set apart a portion for a gift 
unto the LORD. 20Of the first of your 
dough ye shall set apart a cake for a 
gift; as that which is set apart of the 
threshing-floor, so shall ye set it apart. 
21Of the first of your dough ye shall 
give unto the LORD a portion for a gift 
throughout your generations. 

 

22And when ye shall err, and not 
observe all these commandments, 
which the LORD hath spoken unto 
Moses, 23even all that the LORD hath 
commanded you by the hand of 
Moses, from the day that the LORD 
gave commandment, and onward 
throughout your generations; 24then it 
shall be, if it be done in error by the 
congregation, it being hid from their 
eyes, that all the congregation shall 
offer one young bullock for a burnt-
offering, for a sweet savour unto the 
LORD—with the meal-offering thereof, 
and the drink-offering thereof, 
according to the ordinance—and one 
he-goat for a sin-offering. 25And the 
priest shall make atonement for all the 
congregation of the children of Israel, 
and they shall be forgiven; for it was 
an error, and they have brought their 
offering, an offering made by fire unto 
the LORD, and their sin-offering before 
the LORD, for their error. 26And all the 
congregation of the children of Israel 
shall be forgiven, and the stranger that 
sojourneth among them; for in respect 
of all the people it was done in error. 

27And if one person sin through 
error, then he shall offer a she-goat of 
the first year for a sin-offering. 28And 
the priest shall make atonement for the 
soul that erreth, when he sinneth 
through error, before the LORD, to 
make atonement for him; and he shall 


be forgiven, 29both he that is home-
born among the children of Israel, and 
the stranger that sojourneth among 
them: ye shall have one law for him 
that doeth aught in error. 30But the soul 
that doeth aught with a high hand, 
whether he be home-born or a 
stranger, the same blasphemeth the 
LORD; and that soul shall be cut off 
from among his people. 31Because he 
hath despised the word of the LORD, 
and hath broken His commandment; 
that soul shall utterly be cut off, his 
iniquity shall be upon him. 

 

32And while the children of Israel 
were in the wilderness, they found a 
man gathering sticks upon the sabbath 
day. 33And they that found him 
gathering sticks brought him unto 
Moses and Aaron, and unto all the 
congregation. 34And they put him in 
ward, because it had not been declared 
what should be done to him. 35And the 
LORD said unto Moses: ‘The man shall 
surely be put to death; all the 
congregation shall stone him with 
stones without the camp.’ 36And all the 
congregation brought him without the 
camp, and stoned him with stones, and 
he died, as the LORD commanded 
Moses. 

37And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 38’Speak unto the children of 
Israel, and bid them that they make 
them throughout their generations 
fringes in the corners of their 
garments, and that they put with the 
fringe of each corner a thread of blue. 
39And it shall be unto you for a fringe, 
that ye may look upon it, and 
remember all the commandments of 
the LORD, and do them; and that ye go 
not about after your own heart and 
your own eyes, after which ye use to 
go astray; 40that ye may remember and 
do all My commandments, and be holy 
unto your God. 41I am the LORD your 
God, who brought you out of the land 
of Egypt, to be your God: I am the 
LORD your God.’ 


Now Korah, the son of Izhar, 
the son of Kohath, the son of 
Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the 
sons of Eliab, and On, the son of 
Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men; 2and 
they rose up in face of Moses, with 
certain of the children of Israel, two 
hundred and fifty men; they were 
princes of the congregation, the elect 
men of the assembly, men of renown; 
3and they assembled themselves 
together against Moses and against 
Aaron, and said unto them: ‘Ye take 
too much upon you, seeing all the 
congregation are holy, every one of 
them, and the LORD is among them; 
wherefore then lift ye up yourselves 
above the assembly of the LORD?’ 
4And when Moses heard it, he fell 
upon his face. 5And he spoke unto 
Korah and unto all his company, 
saying: ‘In the morning the LORD will 
show who are His, and who is holy, 
and will cause him to come near unto 
Him; even him whom He may choose 
will He cause to come near unto Him. 
16 




6This do: take you censors, Korah, and 
all his company; 7and put fire therein, 
and put incense upon them before the 
LORD to-morrow; and it shall be that 
the man whom the LORD doth choose, 
he shall be holy; ye take too much 
upon you, ye sons of Levi.’ 8And 
Moses said unto Korah: ‘Hear now, ye 
sons of Levi: 9is it but a small thing 
unto you, that the God of Israel hath 
separated you from the congregation 
of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, 
to do the service of the tabernacle of 
the LORD, and to stand before the 
congregation to minister unto them; 
10and that He hath brought thee near, 
and all thy brethren the sons of Levi 
with thee? and will ye seek the 
priesthood also? 11Therefore thou and 
all thy company that are gathered 
together against the LORD—; and as to 
Aaron, what is he that ye murmur 
against him?’ 12And Moses sent to call 
Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; 
and they said: ‘We will not come up; 
13is it a small thing that thou hast 
brought us up out of a land flowing 
with milk and honey, to kill us in the 
wilderness, but thou must needs make 
thyself also a prince over us? 
14Moreover thou hast not brought us 
into a land flowing with milk and 
honey, nor given us inheritance of 
fields and vineyards; wilt thou put out 
the eyes of these men? we will not 
come up.’ 15And Moses was very 
wroth, and said unto the LORD: 
‘Respect not thou their offering; I have 
not taken one ass from them, neither 
have I hurt one of them.’ 16And Moses 
said unto Korah: ‘Be thou and all thy 
congregation before the LORD, thou, 
and they, and Aaron, to-morrow; 17and 
take ye every man his fire-pan, and put 
incense upon them, and bring ye 
before the LORD every man his fire-
pan, two hundred and fifty fire-pans; 
thou also, and Aaron, each his fire-
pan.’ 18And they took every man his 
fire-pan, and put fire in them, and laid 
incense thereon, and stood at the door 
of the tent of meeting with Moses and 
Aaron. 19And Korah assembled all the 
congregation against them unto the 
door of the tent of meeting; and the 
glory of the LORD appeared unto all the 
congregation. 

20And the LORD spoke unto Moses 
and unto Aaron, saying: 21’Separate 
yourselves from among this 
congregation, that I may consume 
them in a moment.’ 22And they fell 
upon their faces, and said: ‘O God, the 
God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one 
man sin, and wilt Thou be wroth with 
all the congregation?’ 

23And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 24’Speak unto the 
congregation, saying: Get you up from 
about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, 
and Abiram.’ 25And Moses rose up and 
went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the 
elders of Israel followed him. 26And he 
spoke unto the congregation, saying: 
‘Depart, I pray you, from the tents of 
these wicked men, and touch nothing 
of theirs, lest ye be swept away in all 
their sins.’ 27So they got them up from 


the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and 
Abiram, on every side; and Dathan and 
Abiram came out, and stood at the 
door of their tents, with their wives, 
and their sons, and their little ones. 
28And Moses said: ‘Hereby ye shall 
know that the LORD hath sent me to do 
all these works, and that I have not 
done them of mine own mind. 29If 
these men die the common death of all 
men, and be visited after the visitation 
of all men, then the LORD hath not sent 
Me. 30But if the LORD make a new 
thing, and the ground open her mouth, 
and swallow them up, with all that 
appertain unto them, and they go down 
alive into the pit, then ye shall 
understand that these men have 
despised the LORD.’ 31And it came to 
pass, as he made an end of speaking all 
these words, that the ground did cleave 
asunder that was under them. 32And 
the earth opened her mouth and 
swallowed them up, and their 
households, and all the men that 
appertained unto Korah, and all their 
goods. 33So they, and all that 
appertained to them, went down alive 
into the pit; and the earth closed upon 
them, and they perished from among 
the assembly. 34And all Israel that 
were round about them fled at the cry 
of them; for they said: ‘Lest the earth 
swallow us up.’ 35And fire came forth 
from the LORD, and devoured the two 
hundred and fifty men that offered the 
incense. 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2‘Speak unto 
Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, 
that he take up the fire-pans out of the 
burning, and scatter thou the fire 
yonder; for they are become holy; 
3even the fire-pans of these men who 
have sinned at the cost of their lives, 
and let them be made beaten plates for 
a covering of the altar—for they are 
become holy, because they were 
offered before the LORD—that they 
may be a sign unto the children of 
Israel.’ 4And Eleazar the priest took 
the brazen fire-pans, which they that 
were burnt had offered; and they beat 
them out for a covering of the altar, 5to 
be a memorial unto the children of 
Israel, to the end that no common man, 
that is not of the seed of Aaron, draw 
near to burn incense before the LORD; 
that he fare not as Korah, and as his 
company; as the LORD spoke unto him 
by the hand of Moses. 

6But on the morrow all the 
congregation of the children of Israel 
murmured against Moses and against 
Aaron, saying: ‘Ye have killed the 
people of the LORD.’ 7And it came to 
pass, when the congregation was 
assembled against Moses and against 
Aaron, that they looked toward the tent 
of meeting; and, behold, the cloud 
covered it, and the glory of the LORD 
appeared. 8And Moses and Aaron 
came to the front of the tent of 
meeting. 9And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 10’Get you up from 
among this congregation, that I may 
consume them in a moment.’ And they 
fell upon their faces. 11And Moses said 17 




unto Aaron: ‘Take thy fire-pan, and 
put fire therein from off the altar, and 
lay incense thereon, and carry it 
quickly unto the congregation, and 
make atonement for them; for there is 
wrath gone out from the LORD: the 
plague is begun.’ 12And Aaron took as 
Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of 
the assembly; and, behold, the plague 
was begun among the people; and he 
put on the incense, and made 
atonement for the people. 13And he 
stood between the dead and the living; 
and the plague was stayed. 14Now they 
that died by the plague were fourteen 
thousand and seven hundred, besides 
them that died about the matter of 
Korah. 15And Aaron returned unto 
Moses unto the door of the tent of 
meeting, and the plague was stayed. 

16And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 17‘Speak unto the children of 
Israel, and take of them rods, one for 
each fathers’house, of all their princes 
according to their fathers’houses, 
twelve rods; thou shalt write every 
man’s name upon his rod. 18And thou 
shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod 
of Levi, for there shall be one rod for 
the head of their fathers’houses. 19And 
thou shalt lay them up in the tent of 
meeting before the testimony, where I 
meet with you. 20And it shall come to 
pass, that the man whom I shall 
choose, his rod shall bud; and I will 
make to cease from Me the 
murmurings of the children of Israel, 
which they murmur against you.’ 
21And Moses spoke unto the children 
of Israel; and all their princes gave him 
rods, for each prince one, according to 
their fathers’houses, even twelve rods; 
and the rod of Aaron was among their 
rods. 22And Moses laid up the rods 
before the LORD in the tent of the 
testimony. 23And it came to pass on the 
morrow, that Moses went into the tent 
of the testimony; and, behold, the rod 
of Aaron for the house of Levi was 
budded, and put forth buds, and 
bloomed blossoms, and bore ripe 
almonds. 24And Moses brought out all 
the rods from before the LORD unto all 
the children of Israel; and they looked, 
and took every man his rod. 

25and the LORD said unto Moses: 
‘Put back the rod of Aaron before the 
testimony, to be kept there, for a token 
against the rebellious children; that 
there may be made an end of their 
murmurings against Me, that they die 
not.’ 26Thus did Moses; as the LORD 
commanded him, so did he. 

27And the children of Israel spoke 
unto Moses, saying: ‘Behold, we 
perish, we are undone, we are all 
undone. 28Every one that cometh near, 
that cometh near unto the tabernacle of 
the LORD, is to die; shall we wholly 
perish?’ 

And the LORD said unto Aaron: 
‘Thou and thy sons and thy 
fathers’house with thee shall bear the 
iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and 
thy sons with thee shall bear the 
iniquity of your priesthood. 2And thy 
brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the 
tribe of thy father, bring thou near with 
18 




thee, that they may be joined unto 
thee, and minister unto thee, thou and 
thy sons with thee being before the 
tent of the testimony. 3And they shall 
keep thy charge, and the charge of all 
the Tent; only they shall not come nigh 
unto the holy furniture and unto the 
altar, that they die not, neither they, 
nor ye. 4And they shall be joined unto 
thee, and keep the charge of the tent of 
meeting, whatsoever the service of the 
Tent may be; but a common man shall 
not draw nigh unto you. 5And ye shall 
keep the charge of the holy things, and 
the charge of the altar, that there be 
wrath no more upon the children of 
Israel. 6And I, behold, I have taken 
your brethren the Levites from among 
the children of Israel; for you they are 
given as a gift unto the LORD, to do the 
service of the tent of meeting. 7And 
thou and thy sons with thee shall keep 
your priesthood in everything that 
pertaineth to the altar, and to that 
within the veil; and ye shall serve; I 
give you the priesthood as a service of 
gift; and the common man that 
draweth nigh shall be put to death.’ 

8And the LORD spoke unto Aaron: 
‘And I, behold, I have given thee the 
charge of My heave-offerings; even of 
all the hallowed things of the children 
of Israel unto thee have I given them 
for a consecrated portion, and to thy 
sons, as a due for ever. 9This shall be 
thine of the most holy things, reserved 
from the fire: every offering of theirs, 
even every meal-offering of theirs, and 
every sin-offering of theirs, and every 
guilt-offering of theirs, which they 
may render unto Me, shall be most 
holy for thee and for thy sons. 10In a 
most holy place shalt thou eat thereof; 
every male may eat thereof; it shall be 
holy unto thee. 11And this is thine: the 
heave-offering of their gift, even all 
the wave-offerings of the children of 
Israel; I have given them unto thee, 
and to thy sons and to thy daughters 
with thee, as a due for ever; every one 
that is clean in thy house may eat 
thereof. 12All the best of the oil, and all 
the best of the wine, and of the corn, 
the first part of them which they give 
unto the LORD, to thee have I given 
them. 13The first-ripe fruits of all that 
is in their land, which they bring unto 
the LORD, shall be thine; every one that 
is clean in thy house may eat thereof. 
14Every thing devoted in Israel shall be 
thine. 15Every thing that openeth the 
womb, of all flesh which they offer 
unto the LORD, both of man and beast, 
shall be thine; howbeit the first-born of 
man shalt thou surely redeem, and the 
firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou 
redeem. 16And their redemption-
money—from a month old shalt thou 
redeem them—shall be, according to 
thy valuation, five shekels of silver, 
after the shekel of the sanctuary—the 
same is twenty gerahs. 17But the 
firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a 
sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou 
shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou 
shalt dash their blood against the altar, 
and shalt make their fat smoke for an 
offering made by fire, for a sweet 


savour unto the LORD. 18And the flesh 
of them shall be thine, as the wave-
breast and as the right thigh, it shall be 
thine. 19All the heave-offerings of the 
holy things, which the children of 
Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given 
thee, and thy sons and thy daughters 
with thee, as a due for ever; it is an 
everlasting covenant of salt before the 
LORD unto thee and to thy seed with 
thee.’ 

20And the LORD said unto Aaron: 
‘Thou shalt have no inheritance in 
their land, neither shalt thou have any 
portion among them; I am thy portion 
and thine inheritance among the 
children of Israel. 21And unto the 
children of Levi, behold, I have given 
all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, 
in return for their service which they 
serve, even the service of the tent of 
meeting. 22And henceforth the children 
of Israel shall not come nigh the tent 
of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. 
23But the Levites alone shall do the 
service of the tent of meeting, and they 
shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a 
statute for ever throughout your 
generations, and among the children of 
Israel they shall have no inheritance. 
24For the tithe of the children of Israel, 
which they set apart as a gift unto the 
LORD, I have given to the Levites for 
an inheritance; therefore I have said 
unto them: Among the children of 
Israel they shall have no inheritance.’ 

25And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 26’Moreover thou shalt speak 
unto the Levites, and say unto them: 
When ye take of the children of Israel 
the tithe which I have given you from 
them for your inheritance, then ye 
shall set apart of it a gift for the LORD, 
even a tithe of the tithe. 27And the gift 
which ye set apart shall be reckoned 
unto you, as though it were the corn of 
the threshing-floor, and as the fulness 
of the wine-press. 28Thus ye also shall 
set apart a gift unto the LORD of all 
your tithes, which ye receive of the 
children of Israel; and thereof ye shall 
give the gift which is set apart unto the 
LORD to Aaron the priest. 29Out of all 
that is given you ye shall set apart all 
of that which is due unto the LORD, of 
all the best thereof, even the hallowed 
part thereof out of it. 30Therefore thou 
shalt say unto them: When ye set apart 
the best thereof from it, then it shall be 
counted unto the Levites as the 
increase of the threshing-floor, and as 
the increase of the wine-press. 31And 
ye may eat it in every place, ye and 
your households; for it is your reward 
in return for your service in the tent of 
meeting. 32And ye shall bear no sin by 
reason of it, seeing that ye have set 
apart from it the best thereof; and ye 
shall not profane the holy things of the 
children of Israel, that ye die not.’ 

 


And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses and unto Aaron, 
saying: 

2This is the statute of the law which 
the LORD hath commanded, saying: 
Speak unto the children of Israel, that 
19 




they bring thee a red heifer, faultless, 
wherein is no blemish, and upon which 
never came yoke. 3And ye shall give 
her unto Eleazar the priest, and she 
shall be brought forth without the 
camp, and she shall be slain before his 
face. 4And Eleazar the priest shall take 
of her blood with his finger, and 
sprinkle of her blood toward the front 
of the tent of meeting seven times. 
5And the heifer shall be burnt in his 
sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her 
blood, with her dung, shall be burnt. 
6And the priest shall take cedar-wood, 
and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into 
the midst of the burning of the heifer. 
7Then the priest shall wash his clothes, 
and he shall bathe his flesh in water, 
and afterward he may come into the 
camp, and the priest shall be unclean 
until the even. 8And he that burneth 
her shall wash his clothes in water, and 
bathe his flesh in water, and shall be 
unclean until the even. 9And a man 
that is clean shall gather up the ashes 
of the heifer, and lay them up without 
the camp in a clean place, and it shall 
be kept for the congregation of the 
children of Israel for a water of 
sprinkling; it is a purification from sin. 
10And he that gathereth the ashes of 
the heifer shall wash his clothes, and 
be unclean until the even; and it shall 
be unto the children of Israel, and unto 
the stranger that sojourneth among 
them, for a statute for ever. 11He that 
toucheth the dead, even any man’s 
dead body, shall be unclean seven 
days; 12the same shall purify himself 
therewith on the third day and on the 
seventh day, and he shall be clean; but 
if he purify not himself the third day 
and the seventh day, he shall not be 
clean. 13Whosoever toucheth the dead, 
even the body of any man that is dead, 
and purifieth not himself—he hath 
defiled the tabernacle of the LORD—
that soul shall be cut off from Israel; 
because the water of sprinkling was 
not dashed against him, he shall be 
unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon 
him. 14This is the law: when a man 
dieth in a tent, every one that cometh 
into the tent, and every thing that is in 
the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 
15And every open vessel, which hath 
no covering close-bound upon it, is 
unclean. 16And whosoever in the open 
field toucheth one that is slain with a 
sword, or one that dieth of himself, or 
a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be 
unclean seven days. 17And for the 
unclean they shall take of the ashes of 
the burning of the purification from 
sin, and running water shall be put 
thereto in a vessel. 18And a clean 
person shall take hyssop, and dip it in 
the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, 
and upon all the vessels, and upon the 
persons that were there, and upon him 
that touched the bone, or the slain, or 
the dead, or the grave. 19And the clean 
person shall sprinkle upon the unclean 
on the third day, and on the seventh 
day; and on the seventh day he shall 
purify him; and he shall wash his 
clothes, and bathe himself in water, 
and shall be clean at even. 20But the 


man that shall be unclean, and shall 
not purify himself, that soul shall be 
cut off from the midst of the assembly, 
because he hath defiled the sanctuary 
of the LORD; the water of sprinkling 
hath not been dashed against him: he is 
unclean. 21And it shall be a perpetual 
statute unto them; and he that 
sprinkleth the water of sprinkling shall 
wash his clothes; and he that toucheth 
the water of sprinkling shall be 
unclean until even. 22And whatsoever 
the unclean person toucheth shall be 
unclean; and the soul that toucheth 
him shall be unclean until even. 

 

20 



And the children of Israel, 
even the whole congregation, 
came into the wilderness of Zin in the 
first month; and the people abode in 
Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and 
was buried there. 2And there was no 
water for the congregation; and they 
assembled themselves together against 
Moses and against Aaron. 3And the 
people strove with Moses, and spoke, 
saying: ‘Would that we had perished 
when our brethren perished before the 
LORD! 4And why have ye brought the 
assembly of the LORD into this 
wilderness, to die there, we and our 
cattle? 5And wherefore have ye made 
us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us 
in unto this evil place? it is no place of 
seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of 
pomegranates; neither is there any 
water to drink.’ 6And Moses and 
Aaron went from the presence of the 
assembly unto the door of the tent of 
meeting, and fell upon their faces; and 
the glory of the LORD appeared unto 
them. 7And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 8’Take the rod, and 
assemble the congregation, thou, and 
Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto 
the rock before their eyes, that it give 
forth its water; and thou shalt bring 
forth to them water out of the rock; so 
thou shalt give the congregation and 
their cattle drink.’ 9And Moses took 
the rod from before the LORD, as He 
commanded him. 10And Moses and 
Aaron gathered the assembly together 
before the rock, and he said unto them: 
‘Hear now, ye rebels; are we to bring 
you forth water out of this rock?’ 
11And Moses lifted up his hand, and 
smote the rock with his rod twice; and 
water came forth abundantly, and the 
congregation drank, and their cattle. 
12And the LORD said unto Moses and 
Aaron: ‘Because ye believed not in 
Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the 
children of Israel, therefore ye shall 
not bring this assembly into the land 
which I have given them.’ 13These are 
the waters of aMeribah, where the 
children of Israel strove with the LORD, 
and He was sanctified in them. 

a That is, Strife. 

14And Moses sent messengers from 
Kadesh unto the king of Edom: ‘Thus 
saith thy brother Israel: Thou knowest 
all the travail that hath befallen us; 
15how our fathers went down into 
Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long 
time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with 


us, and our fathers; 16and when we 
cried unto the LORD, He heard our 
voice, and sent an angel, and brought 
us forth out of Egypt; and, behold, we 
are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost 
of thy border. 17Let us pass, I pray 
thee, through thy land; we will not 
pass through field or through vineyard, 
neither will we drink of the water of 
the wells; we will go along the king’s 
highway, we will not turn aside to the 
right hand nor to the left, until we have 
passed thy border.’ 18And Edom said 
unto him: ‘Thou shalt not pass through 
me, lest I come out with the sword 
against thee.’ 19And the children of 
Israel said unto him: ‘We will go up 
by the highway; and if we drink of thy 
water, I and my cattle, then will I give 
the price thereof; let me only pass 
through on my feet; there is no hurt.’ 
20And he said: ‘Thou shalt not pass 
through.’ And Edom came out against 
him with much people, and with a 
strong hand. 21Thus Edom refused to 
give Israel passage through his border; 
wherefore Israel turned away from 
him. 

22And they journeyed from Kadesh; 
and the children of Israel, even the 
whole congregation, came unto mount 
Hor. 23And the LORD spoke unto Moses 
and Aaron in mount Hor, by the border 
of the land of Edom, saying: 24’Aaron 
shall be gathered unto his people; for 
he shall not enter into the land which I 
have given unto the children of Israel, 
because ye rebelled against My word 
at the waters of Meribah. 25Take Aaron 
and Eleazar his son, and bring them up 
unto mount Hor. 26And strip Aaron of 
his garments, and put them upon 
Eleazar his son; and Aaron shall be 
gathered unto his people, and shall die 
there.’ 27And Moses did as the LORD 
commanded; and they went up into 
mount Hor in the sight of all the 
congregation. 28And Moses stripped 
Aaron of his garments, and put them 
upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died 
there in the top of the mount; and 
Moses and Eleazar came down from 
the mount. 29And when all the 
congregation saw that Aaron was 
dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, 
even all the house of Israel. 

 

21 



And the Canaanite, the king of 
Arad, who dwelt in the South, 
heard tell that Israel came by the way 
of Atharim; and he fought against 
Israel, and took some of them captive. 
2And Israel vowed a vow unto the 
LORD, and said: ‘If Thou wilt indeed 
deliver this people into my hand, then 
I will utterly destroy their cities.’ 3And 
the LORD hearkened to the voice of 
Israel, and delivered up the 
Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed 
them and their cities; and the name of 
the place was called aHormah. 

a That is, Utter destruction. 

4And they journeyed from mount 
Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to 
compass the land of Edom; and the 
soul of the people became impatient 
because of the way. 5And the people 


spoke against God, and against Moses: 
‘Wherefore have ye brought us up out 
of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for 
there is no bread, and there is no 
water; and our soul loatheth this light 
bread.’ 6And the LORD sent fiery 
serpents among the people, and they 
bit the people; and much people of 
Israel died. 7And the people came to 
Moses, and said: ‘We have sinned, 
because we have spoken against the 
LORD, and against thee; pray unto the 
LORD, that He take away the serpents 
from us.’ And Moses prayed for the 
people. 8And the LORD said unto 
Moses: ‘Make thee a fiery serpent, and 
set it upon a pole; and it shall come to 
pass, that every one that is bitten, 
when he seeth it, shall live.’ 9And 
Moses made a serpent of brass, and set 
it upon the pole; and it came to pass, 
that if a serpent had bitten any man, 
when he looked unto the serpent of 
brass, he lived. 10And the children of 
Israel journeyed, and pitched in Oboth. 
11And they journeyed from Oboth, and 
pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness 
which is in front of Moab, toward the 
sun-rising. 12From thence they 
journeyed, and pitched in the valley of 
Zered. 13From thence they journeyed, 
and pitched on the other side of the 
Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that 
cometh out of the border of the 
Amorites.—For Arnon is the border of 
Moab, between Moab and the 
Amorites; 14wherefore it is said in the 
book of the Wars of the LORD: 

Vaheb in Suphah, 

And the valleys of Arnon, 

15And the slope of the valleys 

That inclineth toward the seat of Ar, 

And leaneth upon the border of 
Moab.— 

16And from thence to aBeer; that is 
the well whereof the LORD said unto 
Moses: ‘Gather the people together, 
and I will give them water.’ 17Then 
sang Israel this song: 

a That is, A well. 

Spring up, O well—sing ye unto 
it— 

18The well, which the princes 
digged, 

Which the nobles of the people 
delved, 

With the sceptre, and with their 
staves. 

And from the wilderness to 
Mattanah; 19and from Mattanah to 
Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to 
Bamoth; 20and from Bamoth to the 
valley that is in the field of Moab, by 
the top of Pisgah, which looketh down 
upon the desert. 

21And Israel sent messengers unto 
Sihon king of the Amorites, saying: 
22’Let me pass through thy land; we 
will not turn aside into field, or into 
vineyard; we will not drink of the 
water of the wells; we will go by the 
king’s highway, until we have passed 
thy border.’ 23And Sihon would not 
suffer Israel to pass through his 
border; but Sihon gathered all his 
people together, and went out against 
Israel into the wilderness, and came to 


Jahaz; and he fought against Israel. 
24And Israel smote him with the edge 
of the sword, and possessed his land 
from the Arnon unto the Jabbok, even 
unto the children of Ammon; for the 
border of the children of Ammon was 
strong. 25And Israel took all these 
cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities 
of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all 
the towns thereof. 26For Heshbon was 
the city of Sihon the king of the 
Amorites, who had fought against the 
former king of Moab, and taken all his 
land out of his hand, even unto the 
Arnon. 27Wherefore they that speak in 
parables say: 

Come ye to Heshbon! 

Let the city of Sihon be built and 
established! 

28For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, 

A flame from the city of Sihon; 

It hath devoured Ar of Moab, 

The lords of the high places of 
Arnon. 

29Woe to thee, Moab! 

Thou art undone, O people of 
Chemosh; 

He hath given his sons as fugitives, 

And his daughters into captivity, 

Unto Sihon king of the Amorites. 

30We have shot at them—Heshbon 
is perished—even unto Dibon, 

And we have laid waste even unto 
Nophah, 

Which reacheth unto Medeba. 

31Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the 
Amorites. 32And Moses sent to spy out 
Jazer, and they took the towns thereof, 
and drove out the Amorites that were 
there. 33And they turned and went up 
by the way of Bashan; and Og the king 
of Bashan went out against them, he 
and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
34And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Fear 
him not; for I have delivered him into 
thy hand, and all his people, and his 
land; and thou shalt do to him as thou 
didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, 
who dwelt at Heshbon.’ 35So they 
smote him, and his sons, and all his 
people, until there was none left him 
remaining; and they possessed his 
land. 

And the children of Israel 
journeyed, and pitched in the 
plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at 
Jericho. 


2And Balak the son of Zippor saw 
all that Israel had done to the 
Amorites. 3And Moab was sore afraid 
of the people, because they were 
many; and Moab was overcome with 
dread because of the children of Israel. 
4And Moab said unto the elders of 
Midian: ‘Now will this multitude lick 
up all that is round about us, as the ox 
licketh up the grass of the field.’—And 
Balak the son of Zippor was king of 
Moab at that time.— 5And he sent 
messengers unto Balaam the son of 
Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, 
to the land of the children of his 
people, to call him, saying: ‘Behold, 
there is a people come out from Egypt; 
behold, they cover the face of the 
earth, and they abide over against me. 
6Come now therefore, I pray thee, 
22 




curse me this people; for they are too 
mighty for me; peradventure I shall 
prevail, that we may smite them, and 
that I may drive them out of the land; 
for I know that he whom thou blessest 
is blessed, and he whom thou cursest 
is cursed.’ 7And the elders of Moab 
and the elders of Midian departed with 
the rewards of divination in their hand; 
and they came unto Balaam, and spoke 
unto him the words of Balak. 8And he 
said unto them: ‘Lodge here this night, 
and I will bring you back word, as the 
LORD may speak unto me’; and the 
princes of Moab abode with Balaam. 
9And God came unto Balaam, and 
said: ‘What men are these with thee?’ 
10And Balaam said unto God: ‘Balak 
the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath 
sent unto me [saying]: 11Behold the 
people that is come out of Egypt, it 
covereth the face of the earth; now, 
come curse me them; peradventure I 
shall be able to fight against them, and 
shall drive them out.’ 12And God said 
unto Balaam: ‘Thou shalt not go with 
them; thou shalt not curse the people; 
for they are blessed.’ 13And Balaam 
rose up in the morning, and said unto 
the princes of Balak: ‘Get you into 
your land; for the LORD refuseth to 
give me leave to go with you.’ 14And 
the princes of Moab rose up, and they 
went unto Balak, and said: ‘Balaam 
refuseth to come with us.’ 15And Balak 
sent yet again princes, more, and more 
honourable than they. 16And they came 
to Balaam, and said to him: ‘Thus 
saith Balak the son of Zippor: Let 
nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from 
coming unto me; 17for I will promote 
thee unto very great honour, and 
whatsoever thou sayest unto me I will 
do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse 
me this people.’ 18And Balaam 
answered and said unto the servants of 
Balak: ‘If Balak would give me his 
house full of silver and gold, I cannot 
go beyond the word of the LORD my 
God, to do any thing, small or great. 
19Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye 
also here this night, that I may know 
what the LORD will speak unto me 
more.’ 20And God came unto Balaam 
at night, and said unto him: ‘If the men 
are come to call thee, rise up, go with 
them; but only the word which I speak 
unto thee, that shalt thou do.’ 21And 
Balaam rose up in the morning, and 
saddled his ass, and went with the 
princes of Moab. 22And God’s anger 
was kindled because he went; and the 
angel of the LORD placed himself in the 
way for an adversary against him.—
Now he was riding upon his ass, and 
his two servants were with him.— 
23And the ass saw the angel of the 
LORD standing in the way, with his 
sword drawn in his hand; and the ass 
turned aside out of the way, and went 
into the field; and Balaam smote the 
ass, to turn her into the way. 24Then 
the angel of the LORD stood in a hollow 
way between the vineyards, a fence 
being on this side, and a fence on that 
side. 25And the ass saw the angel of the 
LORD, and she thrust herself unto the 
wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot 


against the wall; and he smote her 
again. 26And the angel of the LORD 
went further, and stood in a narrow 
place, where was no way to turn either 
to the right hand or to the left. 27And 
the ass saw the angel of the LORD, and 
she lay down under Balaam; and 
Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he 
smote the ass with his staff. 28And the 
LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and 
she said unto Balaam: ‘What have I 
done unto thee, that thou hast smitten 
me these three times?’ 29And Balaam 
said unto the ass: ‘Because thou hast 
mocked me; I would there were a 
sword in my hand, for now I had killed 
thee.’ 30And the ass said unto Balaam: 
‘Am not I thine ass, upon which thou 
hast ridden all thy life long unto this 
day? was I ever wont to do so unto 
thee?’ And he said: ‘Nay.’ 31Then the 
LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and 
he saw the angel of the LORD standing 
in the way, with his sword drawn in 
his hand; and he bowed his head, and 
fell on his face. 32And the angel of the 
LORD said unto him: ‘Wherefore hast 
thou smitten thine ass these three 
times? behold, I am come forth for an 
adversary, because thy way is contrary 
unto me; 33and the ass saw me, and 
turned aside before me these three 
times; unless she had turned aside 
from me, surely now I had even slain 
thee, and saved her alive.’ 34And 
Balaam said unto the angel of the 
LORD: ‘I have sinned; for I knew not 
that thou stoodest in the way against 
me; now therefore, if it displease thee, 
I will get me back.’ 35And the angel of 
the LORD said unto Balaam: ‘Go with 
the men; but only the word that I shall 
speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.’ 
So Balaam went with the princes of 
Balak. 36And when Balak heard that 
Balaam was come, he went out to meet 
him unto Ir-moab, which is on the 
border of Arnon, which is in the 
utmost part of the border. 37And Balak 
said unto Balaam: ‘Did I not earnestly 
send unto thee to call thee? wherefore 
camest thou not unto me? am I not 
able indeed to promote thee to 
honour?’ 38And Balaam said unto 
Balak: ‘Lo, I am come unto thee; have 
I now any power at all to speak any 
thing? the word that God putteth in my 
mouth, that shall I speak.’ 39And 
Balaam went with Balak, and they 
came unto Kiriath-huzoth. 40And 
Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and 
sent to Balaam, and to the princes that 
were with him. 41And it came to pass 
in the morning that Balak took 
Balaam, and brought him up into 
Bamoth-baal, and he saw from thence 
the utmost part of the people. 

And Balaam said unto Balak: 
‘Build me here seven altars, 
and prepare me here seven bullocks 
and seven rams.’ 2And Balak did as 
Balaam had spoken; and Balak and 
Balaam offered on every altar a 
bullock and a ram. 3And Balaam said 
unto Balak: ‘Stand by thy burnt-
offering, and I will go; peradventure 
the LORD will come to meet me; and 
whatsoever He showeth me I will tell 
23 




thee.’ And he went to a bare height. 
4And God met Balaam; and he said 
unto Him: ‘I have prepared the seven 
altars, and I have offered up a bullock 
and a ram on every altar.’ 5And the 
LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, 
and said: ‘Return unto Balak, and thus 
thou shalt speak.’ 6And he returned 
unto him, and, lo, he stood by his 
burnt-offering, he, and all the princes 
of Moab. 7And he took up his parable, 
and said: 

From Aram Balak bringeth me, 

The king of Moab from the 
mountains of the East: 

‘Come, curse me Jacob, 

And come, execrate Israel.’ 

8How shall I curse, whom God hath 
not cursed? 

And how shall I execrate, whom the 
LORD hath not execrated? 

9For from the top of the rocks I see 
him, 

And from the hills I behold him: 

Lo, it is a people that shall dwell 
alone, 

And shall not be reckoned among 
the nations. 

10Who hath counted the dust of 
Jacob, 

Or numbered the stock of Israel? 

Let me die the death of the 
righteous, 

And let mine end be like his! 

11And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘What 
hast thou done unto me? I took thee to 
curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou 
hast blessed them altogether.’ 12And he 
answered and said: ‘Must I not take 
heed to speak that which the LORD 
putteth in my mouth?’ 13And Balak 
said unto him: ‘Come, I pray thee, 
with me unto another place, from 
whence thou mayest see them; thou 
shalt see but the utmost part of them, 
and shalt not see them all; and curse 
me them from thence.’ 14And he took 
him into the field of Zophim, to the top 
of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and 
offered up a bullock and a ram on 
every altar. 15And he said unto Balak: 
‘Stand here by thy burnt-offering, 
while I go toward a meeting yonder.’ 
16And the LORD met Balaam, and put a 
word in his mouth, and said: ‘Return 
unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.’ 
17And he came to him, and, lo, he 
stood by his burnt-offering, and the 
princes of Moab with him. And Balak 
said unto him: ‘What hath the LORD 
spoken?’ 18And he took up his parable, 
and said: 

Arise, Balak, and hear; 

Give ear unto me, thou son of 
Zippor: 

19God is not a man, that He should 
lie; 

Neither the son of man, that He 
should repent: 

When He hath said, will He not do 
it? 

Or when He hath spoken, will He 
not make it good? 

20Behold, I am bidden to bless; 

And when He hath blessed, I cannot 
call it back. 

21None hath beheld iniquity in 
Jacob, 


Neither hath one seen perverseness 
in Israel; 

The LORD his God is with him, 

And the shouting for the King is 
among them. 

22God who brought them forth out 
of Egypt 

Is for them like the lofty horns of 
the wild-ox. 

23For there is no enchantment with 
Jacob, 

Neither is there any divination with 
Israel; 

Now is it said of Jacob and of Israel: 

‘What hath God wrought! ’ 

24Behold a people that riseth up as a 
lioness, 

And as a lion doth he lift himself up; 

He shall not lie down until he eat of 
the prey, 

And drink the blood of the slain. 

25And Balak said unto Balaam: 
‘Neither curse them at all, nor bless 
them at all.’ 26But Balaam answered 
and said unto Balak: ‘Told not I thee, 
saying: All that the LORD speaketh, that 
I must do?’ 27And Balak said unto 
Balaam: ‘Come now, I will take thee 
unto another place; peradventure it 
will please God that thou mayest curse 
me them from thence.’ 28And Balak 
took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that 
looketh down upon the desert. 29And 
Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Build me 
here seven altars, and prepare me here 
seven bullocks and seven rams.’ 30And 
Balak did as Balaam had said, and 
offered up a bullock and a ram on 
every altar. 

And when Balaam saw that it 
pleased the LORD to bless 
Israel, he went not, as at the other 
times, to meet with enchantments, but 
he set his face toward the wilderness. 
2And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he 
saw Israel dwelling tribe by tribe; and 
the spirit of God came upon him. 3And 
he took up his parable, and said: 

The saying of Balaam the son of 
Beor, 

And the saying of the man whose 
eye is opened; 

4The saying of him who heareth the 
words of God, 

Who seeth the vision of the 
Almighty, Fallen down, yet with 
opened eyes: 

5How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, 

Thy dwellings, O Israel! 

6As valleys stretched out, 

As gardens by the river-side; 

As aloes planted of the LORD, 

As cedars beside the waters; 

7Water shall flow from his branches, 

And his seed shall be in many 
waters; 

And his king shall be higher than 
Agag, 

And his kingdom shall be exalted. 

8God who brought him forth out of 
Egypt 

Is for him like the lofty horns of the 
wild-ox; 

He shall eat up the nations that are 
his adversaries, 

And shall break their bones in 
pieces, 
24 




And pierce them through with his 
arrows. 

9He couched, he lay down as a lion, 

And as a lioness; who shall rouse 
him up? 

Blessed be every one that blesseth 
thee, 

And cursed be every one that 
curseth thee. 

10And Balak’s anger was kindled 
against Balaam, and he smote his 
hands together; and Balak said unto 
Balaam: ‘I called thee to curse mine 
enemies, and, behold, thou hast 
altogether blessed them these three 
times. 11Therefore now flee thou to thy 
place; I thought to promote thee unto 
great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath 
kept thee back from honour.’ 12And 
Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Spoke I not 
also to thy messengers that thou didst 
send unto me, saying: 13If Balak would 
give me his house full of silver and 
gold, I cannot go beyond the word of 
the LORD, to do either good or bad of 
mine own mind; what the LORD 
speaketh, that will I speak? 14And now, 
behold, I go unto my people; come, 
and I will announce to thee what this 
people shall do to thy people in the 
end of days.’ 15And he took up his 
parable, and said: 

The saying of Balaam the son of 
Beor, 

And the saying of the man whose 
eye is opened; 

16The saying of him who heareth the 
words of God, 

And knoweth the knowledge of the 
Most High, 

Who seeth the vision of the 
Almighty, 

Fallen down, yet with opened eyes: 

17I see him, but not now; 

I behold him, but not nigh; 

There shall step forth a star out of 
Jacob, 

And a scepter shall rise out of Israel, 

And shall smite through the corners 
of Moab, 

And break down all the sons of 
Seth. 

18And Edom shall be a possession, 

Seir also, even his enemies, shall be 
a possession; 

While Israel doeth valiantly. 

19And out of Jacob shall one have 
dominion, 

And shall destroy the remnant from 
the city. 

 

20And he looked on Amalek, and 
took up his parable, and said: 

Amalek was the first of the nations; 

But his end shall come to 
destruction. 

 

21And he looked on the Kenite, and 
took up his parable, and said: 

Though firm be thy dwelling-place, 

And though thy nest be set in the 
rock; 

22Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted; 

How long? Asshur shall carry thee 
away captive. 

 


23And he took up his parable, and 
said: 

Alas, who shall live after God hath 
appointed him? 

24But ships shall come from the 
coast of Kittim, 

And they shall afflict Asshur, and 
shall afflict Eber, 

And he also shall come to 
destruction. 

 

25And Balaam rose up, and went and 
returned to his place; and Balak also 
went his way. 

 

And Israel abode in Shittim, 
and the people began to 
commit harlotry with the daughters of 
Moab. 2And they called the people 
unto the sacrifices of their gods; and 
the people did eat, and bowed down to 
their gods. 3And Israel joined himself 
unto the Baal of Peor; and the anger of 
the LORD was kindled against Israel. 
4And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Take 
all the chiefs of the people, and hang 
them up unto the LORD in face of the 
sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD 
may turn away from Israel.’ 5And 
Moses said unto the judges of Israel: 
‘Slay ye every one his men that have 
joined themselves unto the Baal of 
Peor.’ 6And, behold, one of the 
children of Israel came and brought 
unto his brethren a Midianitish woman 
in the sight of Moses, and in the sight 
of all the congregation of the children 
of Israel, while they were weeping at 
the door of the tent of meeting. 7And 
when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the 
son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose 
up from the midst of the congregation, 
and took a spear in his hand. 8And he 
went after the man of Israel into the 
chamber, and thrust both of them 
through, the man of Israel, and the 
woman through her belly. So the 
plague was stayed from the children of 
Israel. 9And those that died by the 
plague were twenty and four thousand. 


10And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 11’Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, 
the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned 
My wrath away from the children of 
Israel, in that he was very jealous for 
My sake among them, so that I 
consumed not the children of Israel in 
My jealousy. 12Wherefore say: Behold, 
I give unto him My covenant of peace; 
13and it shall be unto him, and to his 
seed after him, the covenant of an 
everlasting priesthood; because he was 
jealous for his God, and made 
atonement for the children of Israel.’ 
14Now the name of the man of Israel 
that was slain, who was slain with the 
Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the 
son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’house 
among the Simeonites. 15And the name 
of the Midianitish woman that was 
slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; 
he was head of the people of a 
fathers’house in Midian. 

16And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 17’Harass the Midianites, and 
smite them; 18for they harass you, by 
their wiles wherewith they have 
25 




beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and 
in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of 
the prince of Midian, their sister, who 
was slain on the day of the plague in 
the matter of Peor.’ 

19And it came to pass after the 

plague, 1that the LORD spoke 
unto Moses and unto Eleazar 
the son of Aaron the priest, saying: 
2’Take the sum of all the congregation 
of the children of Israel, from twenty 
years old and upward, by their 
fathers’houses, all that are able to go 
forth to war in Israel.’ 3And Moses and 
Eleazar the priest spoke with them in 
the plains of Moab by the Jordan at 
Jericho, saying: 4’[Take the sum of the 
people,] from twenty years old and 
upward, as the LORD commanded 
Moses and the children of Israel, that 
came forth out of the land of Egypt.’

company of Korah, when they strove 
against the LORD; 10and the earth 
opened her mouth, and swallowed 
them up together with Korah, when 
that company died; what time the fire 
devoured two hundred and fifty men, 
and they became a sign.

52And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 53’Unto these the land shall be 
divided for an inheritance according to 
the number of names. 54To the more 
thou shalt give the more inheritance, 
and to the fewer thou shalt give the 
less inheritance; to each one according 
to those that were numbered of it shall 
its inheritance be given. 
55Notwithstanding the land shall be 
divided by lot; according to the names 
of the tribes of their fathers they shall 
inherit. 56According to the lot shall 
their inheritance be divided between 
the more and the fewer.’ 

57And these are they that were 
numbered of the Levites after their 
families: of Gershon, the family of the 
Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of 
the Kohathites; of Merari, the family

59And the name of Amram’s wife was 
Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who 
was born to Levi in Egypt; and she 
bore unto Amram Aaron and Moses, 
and Miriam their sister. 60And unto 
Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, 
Eleazar and Ithamar. 61And Nadab and 
Abihu died, when they offered strange 
fire before the LORD. 62And they that 
were numbered of them were twenty 
and three thousand, every male from a 
month old and upward; for they were 
not numbered among the children of 
Israel, because there was no 
inheritance given them among the 
children of Israel. 

63These are they that were numbered 
by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who 
numbered the children of Israel in the 
plains of Moab by the Jordan at 
Jericho. 64But among these there was 
not a man of them that were numbered 
by Moses and Aaron the priest, who 
numbered the children of Israel in the 
wilderness of Sinai. 65For the LORD had 


said of them: ‘They shall surely die in 
the wilderness.’ And there was not left 
a man of them, save Caleb the son of 
Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 

Then drew near the daughters 
of Zelophehad, the son of 
Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of 
Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the 
families of Manasseh the son of 
Joseph; and these are the names of his 
daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, 
and Milcah, and Tirzah. 2And they 
stood before Moses, and before 
Eleazar the priest, and before the 
princes and all the congregation, at the 
door of the tent of meeting, saying: 
3’Our father died in the wilderness, 
and he was not among the company of 
them that gathered themselves together 
against the LORD in the company of 
Korah, but he died in his own sin; and 
he had no sons. 4Why should the name 
of our father be done away from 
among his family, because he had no 
son? Give unto us a possession among 
the brethren of our father.’ 5And 
Moses brought their cause before the 
LORD. 6And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 7’The daughters of 
Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt 
surely give them a possession of an 
inheritance among their father’s 
brethren; and thou shalt cause the 
inheritance of their father to pass unto 
them. 8And thou shalt speak unto the 
children of Israel, saying: If a man die, 
and have no son, then ye shall cause 
his inheritance to pass unto his 
daughter. 9And if he have no daughter, 
then ye shall give his inheritance unto 
his brethren. 10And if he have no 
brethren, then ye shall give his 
inheritance unto his father’s brethren. 
11And if his father have no brethren, 
then ye shall give his inheritance unto 
his kinsman that is next to him of his 
family, and he shall possess it. And it 
shall be unto the children of Israel a 
statute of judgment, as the LORD 
commanded Moses.’ 

12And the LORD said unto Moses: 
‘Get thee up into this mountain of 
Abarim, and behold the land which I 
have given unto the children of Israel. 
13And when thou hast seen it, thou also 
shalt be gathered unto thy people, as 
Aaron thy brother was gathered; 
14because ye rebelled against My 
commandment in the wilderness of 
Zin, in the strife of the congregation, 
to sanctify Me at the waters before 
their eyes.’—These are the waters of 
Meribath-kadesh in the wilderness of 
Zin.—15And Moses spoke unto the 
LORD, saying: 16’Let the LORD, the God 
of the spirits of all flesh, set a man 
over the congregation, 17who may go 
out before them, and who may come in 
before them, and who may lead them 
out, and who may bring them in; that 
the congregation of the LORD be not as 
sheep which have no shepherd.’ 18And 
the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Take thee 
Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom 
is spirit, and lay thy hand upon him; 
19and set him before Eleazar the priest, 
and before all the congregation; and 
give him a charge in their sight. 20And 
27 




thou shalt put of thy honour upon him, 
that all the congregation of the 
children of Israel may hearken. 21And 
he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, 
who shall inquire for him by the 
judgment of the Urim before the LORD; 
at his word shall they go out, and at his 
word they shall come in, both he, and 
all the children of Israel with him, 
even all the congregation.’ 22And 
Moses did as the LORD commanded 
him; and he took Joshua, and set him 
before Eleazar the priest, and before 
all the congregation. 23And he laid his 
hands upon him, and gave him a 
charge, as the LORD spoke by the hand 
of Moses. 

 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2Command the 
children of Israel, and say unto them: 

My food which is presented unto 
Me for offerings made by fire, of a 
sweet savour unto Me, shall ye 
observe to offer unto Me in its due 
season. 3And thou shalt say unto them: 
This is the offering made by fire which 
ye shall bring unto the LORD: he-lambs 
of the first year without blemish, two 
day by day, for a continual burnt-
offering. 4The one lamb shalt thou 
offer in the morning, and the other 
lamb shalt thou offer at dusk; 5and the 
tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for 
a meal-offering, mingled with the 
fourth part of a hin of beaten oil. 6It is 
a continual burnt-offering, which was 
offered in mount Sinai, for a sweet 
savour, an offering made by fire unto 
the LORD. 7And the drink-offering 
thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin 
for the one lamb; in the holy place 
shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of 
strong drink unto the LORD. 8And the 
other lamb shalt thou present at dusk; 
as the meal-offering of the morning, 
and as the drink-offering thereof, thou 
shalt present it, an offering made by 
fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 

9And on the sabbath day two he-
lambs of the first year without 
blemish, and two tenth parts of an 
ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, 
mingled with oil, and the drink-
offering thereof. 10This is the burnt-
offering of every sabbath, beside the 
continual burnt-offering, and the 
drink-offering thereof. 

11And in your new moons ye shall 
present a burnt-offering unto the LORD: 
two young bullocks, and one ram, 
seven he-lambs of the first year 
without blemish; 12and three tenth 
parts of an ephah of fine flour for a 
meal-offering, mingled with oil, for 
each bullock; and two tenth parts of 
fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled 
with oil, for the one ram; 13and a 
several tenth part of fine flour mingled 
with oil for a meal-offering unto every 
lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet 
savour, an offering made by fire unto 
the LORD. 14And their drink-offerings 
shall be half a hin of wine for a 
bullock, and the third part of a hin for 
the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for 
a lamb. This is the burnt-offering of 
every new moon throughout the 
28 




months of the year. 15And one he-goat 
for a sin-offering unto the LORD; it 
shall be offered beside the continual 
burnt-offering, and the drink-offering 
thereof. 

16And in the first month, on the 
fourteenth day of the month, is the 
LORD’S passover. 17And on the 
fifteenth day of this month shall be a 
feast; seven days shall unleavened 
bread be eaten. 18In the first day shall 
be a holy convocation; ye shall do no 
manner of servile work; 19but ye shall 
present an offering made by fire, a 
burnt-offering unto the LORD: two 
young bullocks, and one ram, and 
seven he-lambs of the first year; they 
shall be unto you without blemish; 
20and their meal-offering, fine flour 
mingled with oil; three tenth parts 
shall ye offer for a bullock, and two 
tenth parts for the ram; 21a several 
tenth part shalt thou offer for every 
lamb of the seven lambs; 22and one he-
goat for a sin-offering, to make 
atonement for you. 23Ye shall offer 
these beside the burnt-offering of the 
morning, which is for a continual 
burnt-offering. 24After this manner ye 
shall offer daily, for seven days, the 
food of the offering made by fire, of a 
sweet savour unto the LORD; it shall be 
offered beside the continual burnt-
offering, and the drink-offering 
thereof. 25And on the seventh day ye 
shall have a holy convocation; ye shall 
do no manner of servile work. 

26Also in the day of the first-fruits, 
when ye bring a new meal-offering 
unto the LORD in your feast of weeks, 
ye shall have a holy convocation: ye 
shall do no manner of servile work; 
27but ye shall present a burnt-offering 
for a sweet savour unto the LORD: two 
young bullocks, one ram, seven he-
lambs of the first year; 28and their 
meal-offering, fine flour mingled with 
oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, 
two tenth parts for the one ram, 29a 
several tenth part for every lamb of the 
seven lambs; 30one he-goat, to make 
atonement for you. 31Beside the 
continual burnt-offering, and the meal-
offering thereof, ye shall offer them—
they shall be unto you without 
blemish—and their drink-offerings. 

And in the seventh month, on 
the first day of the month, ye 
shall have a holy convocation: ye shall 
do no manner of servile work; it is a 
day of blowing the horn unto you. 
2And ye shall prepare a burnt-offering 
for a sweet savour unto the LORD: one 
young bullock, one ram, seven he-
lambs of the first year without 
blemish; 3and their meal-offering, fine 
flour mingled with oil, three tenth 
parts for the bullock, two tenth part for 
the ram, 4and one tenth part for every 
lamb of the seven lambs; 5and one he-
goat for a sin-offering, to make 
atonement for you; 6beside the burnt-
offering of the new moon, and the 
meal-offering thereof, and the 
continual burnt-offering and the meal-
offering thereof, and their drink-
offerings, according unto their 
29 




ordinance, for a sweet savour, an 
offering made by fire unto the LORD. 

7And on the tenth day of this 
seventh month ye shall have a holy 
convocation; and ye shall afflict your 
souls; ye shall do no manner of work; 
8but ye shall present a burnt-offering 
unto the LORD for a sweet savour: one 
young bullock, one ram, seven he-
lambs of the first year; they shall be 
unto you without blemish; 9and their 
meal-offering, fine flour mingled with 
oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, 
two tenth parts for the one ram, 10a 
several tenth part for every lamb of the 
seven lambs; 11one he-goat for a sin-
offering; beside the sin-offering of 
atonement, and the continual burnt-
offering, and the meal-offering 
thereof, and their drink-offerings. 

12And on the fifteenth day of the 
seventh month ye shall have a holy 
convocation: ye shall do no manner of 
servile work, and ye shall keep a feast 
unto the LORD seven days; 13and ye 
shall present a burnt-offering, an 
offering made by fire, of a sweet 
savour unto the LORD: thirteen young 
bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs 
of the first year; they shall be without 
blemish; 14and their meal-offering, fine 
flour mingled with oil, three tenth 
parts for every bullock of the thirteen 
bullocks, two tenth parts for each ram 
of the two rams, 15and a several tenth 
part for every lamb of the fourteen 
lambs; 16and one he-goat for a sin-
offering beside the continual burnt-
offering, the meal-offering thereof, 
and the drink-offering thereof. 

17And on the second day ye shall 
present twelve young bullocks, two 
rams, fourteen he-lambs of the first 
year without blemish; 18and their meal-
offering and their drink-offerings for 
the bullocks, for the rams, and for the 
lambs, according to their number, after 
the ordinance; 19and one he-goat for a 
sin-offering; beside the continual 
burnt-offering, and the meal-offering 
thereof, and their drink-offerings. 

20And on the third day eleven 
bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs 
of the first year without blemish; 21and 
their meal-offering and their drink-
offerings for the bullocks, for the 
rams, and for the lambs, according to 
their number, after the ordinance; 
22and one he-goat for a sin-offering; 
beside the continual burnt-offering, 
and the meal-offering thereof, and the 
drink-offering thereof. 

23And on the fourth day ten 
bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs 
of the first year without blemish; 
24their meal-offering and their drink-
offerings for the bullocks, for the 
rams, and for the lambs, according to 
their number, after the ordinance; 
25and one he-goat for a sin-offering; 
beside the continual burnt-offering, the 
meal-offering thereof, and the drink-
offering thereof. 

26And on the fifth day nine bullocks, 
two rams, fourteen he-lambs of the 
first year without blemish; 27and their 
meal-offering and their drink-offerings 


for the bullocks, for the rams, and for 
the lambs, according to their number, 
after the ordinance; 28and one he-goat 
for a sin-offering; beside the continual 
burnt-offering, and the meal-offering 
thereof, and the drink-offering thereof. 

29And on the sixth day eight 
bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs 
of the first year without blemish; 30and 
their meal-offering and their drink-
offerings for the bullocks, for the 
rams, and for the lambs, according to 
their number, after the ordinance; 
31and one he-goat for a sin-offering; 
beside the continual burnt-offering, the 
meal-offering thereof, and the drink-
offerings thereof. 

32And on the seventh day seven 
bullocks, two rams, fourteen he-lambs 
of the first year without blemish; 33and 
their meal-offering and their drink-
offerings for the bullocks, for the 
rams, and for the lambs, according to 
their number, after the ordinance; 
34and one he-goat for a sin-offering; 
beside the continual burnt-offering, the 
meal-offering thereof, and the drink-
offering thereof. 

35On the eighth day ye shall have a 
solemn assembly: ye shall do no 
manner of servile work; 36but ye shall 
present a burnt-offering, an offering 
made by fire, of a sweet savour unto 
the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven 
he-lambs of the first year without 
blemish; 37their meal-offering and their 
drink-offerings for the bullock, for the 
ram, and for the lambs, shall be 
according to their number, after the 
ordinance; 38and one he-goat for a sin-
offering; beside the continual burnt-
offering, and the meal-offering 
thereof, and the drink-offering thereof. 

39These ye shall offer unto the LORD 
in your appointed seasons, beside your 
vows, and your freewill-offerings, 
whether they be your burnt-offerings, 
or your meal-offerings, or your drink-
offerings, or your peace-offerings. 

And Moses told the children 
of Israel according to all that 
the LORD commanded Moses. 

 


2And Moses spoke unto the heads of 
the tribes of the children of Israel, 
saying: 

This is the thing which the LORD 
hath commanded. 3When a man 
voweth a vow unto the LORD, or 
sweareth an oath to bind his soul with 
a bond, he shall not break his word; he 
shall do according to all that 
proceedeth out of his mouth. 4Also 
when a woman voweth a vow unto the 
LORD, and bindeth herself by a bond, 
being in her father’s house, in her 
youth, 5and her father heareth her vow, 
or her bond wherewith she hath bound 
her soul, and her father holdeth his 
peace at her, then all her vows shall 
stand, and every bond wherewith she 
hath bound her soul shall stand. 6But if 
her father disallow her in the day that 
he heareth, none of her vows, or of her 
bonds wherewith she hath bound her 
soul, shall stand; and the LORD will 
forgive her, because her father 
30 




disallowed her. 7And if she be married 
to a husband, while her vows are upon 
her, or the clear utterance of her lips, 
wherewith she hath bound her soul; 
8and her husband hear it, whatsoever 
day it be that he heareth it, and hold 
his peace at her; then her vows shall 
stand, and her bonds wherewith she 
hath bound her soul shall stand. 9But if 
her husband disallow her in the day 
that he heareth it, then he shall make 
void her vow which is upon her, and 
the clear utterance of her lips, 
wherewith she hath bound her soul; 
and the LORD will forgive her. 10But 
the vow of a widow, or of her that is 
divorced, even every thing wherewith 
she hath bound her soul, shall stand 
against her. 11 And if a woman vowed 
in her husband’s house, or bound her 
soul by a bond with an oath, 12and her 
husband heard it, and held his peace at 
her, and disallowed her not, then all 
her vows shall stand, and every bond 
wherewith she bound her soul shall 
stand. 13But if her husband make them 
null and void in the day that he heareth 
them, then whatsoever proceeded out 
of her lips, whether it were her vows, 
or the bond of her soul, shall not stand: 
her husband hath made them void; and 
the LORD will forgive her. 14Every 
vow, and every binding oath to afflict 
the soul, her husband may let it stand, 
or her husband may make it void. 
15But if her husband altogether hold 
his peace at her from day to day, then 
he causeth all her vows to stand, or all 
her bonds, which are upon her; he hath 
let them stand, because he held his 
peace at her in the day that he heard 
them. 16But if he shall make them null 
and void after that he hath heard them, 
then he shall bear her iniquity. 17These 
are the statutes, which the LORD 
commanded Moses, between a man 
and his wife, between a father and his 
daughter, being in her youth, in her 
father’s house. 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2’Avenge the 
children of Israel of the Midianites; 
afterward shalt thou be gathered unto 
thy people.’ 3And Moses spoke unto 
the people, saying: ‘Arm ye men from 
among you for the war, that they may 
go against Midian, to execute the 
LORD’S vengeance on Midian. 4Of 
every tribe a thousand, throughout all 
the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the 
war.’ 5So there were delivered, out of 
the thousands of Israel, a thousand of 
every tribe, twelve thousand armed for 
war. 6And Moses sent them, a 
thousand of every tribe, to the war, 
them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar 
the priest, to the war, with the holy 
vessels and the trumpets for the alarm 
in his hand. 7And they warred against 
Midian, as the LORD commanded 
Moses; and they slew every male. 
8And they slew the kings of Midian 
with the rest of their slain: Evi, and 
Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, 
the five kings of Midian; Balaam also 
the son of Beor they slew with the 
sword. 9And the children of Israel took 
captive the women of Midian and their 
31 




little ones; and all their cattle, and all 
their flocks, and all their goods, they 
took for a prey. 10And all their cities in 
the places wherein they dwelt, and all 
their encampments, they burnt with 
fire. 11And they took all the spoil, and 
all the prey, both of man and of beast. 
12And they brought the captives, and 
the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, 
and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto 
the congregation of the children of 
Israel, unto the camp, unto the plains 
of Moab, which are by the Jordan at 
Jericho. 

13And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, 
and all the princes of the congregation, 
went forth to meet them without the 
camp. 14And Moses was wroth with 
the officers of the host, the captains of 
thousands and the captains of 
hundreds, who came from the service 
of the war. 15And Moses said unto 
them: ‘Have ye saved all the women 
alive? 16Behold, these caused the 
children of Israel, through the counsel 
of Balaam, to revolt so as to break 
faith with the LORD in the matter of 
Peor, and so the plague was among the 
congregation of the LORD. 17Now 
therefore kill every male among the 
little ones, and kill every woman that 
hath known man by lying with him. 
18But all the women children, that have 
not known man by lying with him, 
keep alive for yourselves. 19And 
encamp ye without the camp seven 
days; whosoever hath killed any 
person, and whosoever hath touched 
any slain, purify yourselves on the 
third day and on the seventh day, ye 
and your captives. 20And as to every 
garment, and all that is made of skin, 
and all work of goats’hair, and all 
things made of wood, ye shall purify.’ 

21And Eleazar the priest said unto 
the men of war that went to the battle: 
‘This is the statute of the law which 
the LORD hath commanded Moses: 
22Howbeit the gold, and the silver, the 
brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
23every thing that may abide the fire, 
ye shall make to go through the fire, 
and it shall be clean; nevertheless it 
shall be purified with the water of 
sprinkling; and all that abideth not the 
fire ye shall make to go through the 
water. 24And ye shall wash your 
clothes on the seventh day, and ye 
shall be clean, and afterward ye may 
come into the camp.’ 

25And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 26’Take the sum of the prey 
that was taken, both of man and of 
beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and 
the heads of the fathers’houses of the 
congregation; 27and divide the prey 
into two parts: between the men 
skilled in war, that went out to battle, 
and all the congregation; 28and levy a 
tribute unto the LORD of the men of 
war that went out to battle: one soul of 
five hundred, both of the persons, and 
of the beeves, and of the asses, and of 
the flocks; 29take it of their half, and 
give it unto Eleazar the priest, as a 
portion set apart for the LORD. 30And of 
the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt 
take one drawn out of every fifty, of 


the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, 
and of the flocks, even of all the cattle, 
and give them unto the Levites, that 
keep the charge of the tabernacle of 
the LORD.’ 31And Moses and Eleazar 
the priest did as the LORD commanded 
Moses. 32Now the prey, over and 
above the booty which the men of war 
took, was six hundred thousand and 
seventy thousand and five thousand 
sheep, 33and threescore and twelve 
thousand beeves, 34and threescore and 
one thousand asses, 35and thirty and 
two thousand persons in all, of the 
women that had not known man by 
lying with him. 36And the half, which 
was the portion of them that went out 
to war, was in number three hundred 
thousand and thirty thousand and 
seven thousand and five hundred 
sheep. 37And the LORD’S tribute of the 
sheep was six hundred and threescore 
and fifteen. 38And the beeves were 
thirty and six thousand, of which the 
LORD’S tribute was threescore and 
twelve. 39And the asses were thirty 
thousand and five hundred, of which 
the LORD’S tribute was threescore and 
one. 40And the persons were sixteen 
thousand, of whom the LORD’S tribute 
was thirty and two persons. 41And 
Moses gave the tribute, which was set 
apart for the LORD, unto Eleazar the 
priest, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
42And of the children of Israel’s half, 
which Moses divided off from the men 
that warred— 43now the congregation’s 
half was three hundred thousand and 
thirty thousand and seven thousand 
and five hundred sheep, 44and thirty 
and six thousand beeves, 45and thirty 
thousand and five hundred asses, 46and 
sixteen thousand persons— 47even of 
the children of Israel’s half, Moses 
took one drawn out of every fifty, both 
of man and of beast, and gave them 
unto the Levites, that kept the charge 
of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the 
LORD commanded Moses. 

48And the officers that were over the 
thousands of the host, the captains of 
thousands, and the captains of 
hundreds, came near unto Moses; 
49and they said unto Moses: ‘Thy 
servants have taken the sum of the 
men of war that are under our charge, 
and there lacketh not one man of us. 
50And we have brought the LORD’S 
offering, what every man hath gotten, 
of jewels of gold, armlets, and 
bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and 
girdles, to make atonement for our 
souls before the LORD.’ 51And Moses 
and Eleazar the priest took the gold of 
them, even all wrought jewels. 52And 
all the gold of the gift that they set 
apart for the LORD, of the captains of 
thousands, and of the captains of 
hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven 
hundred and fifty shekels.— 53For the 
men of war had taken booty, every 
man for himself.— 54And Moses and 
Eleazar the priest took the gold of the 
captains of thousands and of hundreds, 
and brought it into the tent of meeting, 
for a memorial for the children of 
Israel before the LORD. 

 



Now the children of Reuben 
and the children of Gad had a 
very great multitude of cattle; and 
when they saw the land of Jazer, and 
the land of Gilead, that, behold, the 
place was a place for cattle, 2the 
children of Gad and the children of 
Reuben came and spoke unto Moses, 
and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the 
princes of the congregation, saying: 
3’Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and 
Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, 
and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 4the 
land which the LORD smote before the 
congregation of Israel, is a land for 
cattle, and thy servants have cattle.’ 
5And they said: ‘If we have found 
favour in thy sight, let this land be 
given unto thy servants for a 
possession; bring us not over the 
Jordan.’ 6And Moses said unto the 
children of Gad and to the children of 
Reuben: ‘Shall your brethren go to the 
war, and shall ye sit here? 7And 
wherefore will ye turn away the heart 
of the children of Israel from going 
over into the land which the LORD hath 
given them? 8Thus did your fathers, 
when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea 
to see the land. 9For when they went 
up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw 
the land, they turned away the heart of 
the children of Israel, that they should 
not go into the land which the LORD 
had given them. 10And the LORD’S 
anger was kindled in that day, and He 
swore, saying: 11Surely none of the 
men that came up out of Egypt, from 
twenty years old and upward, shall see 
the land which I swore unto Abraham, 
unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because 
they have not wholly followed Me; 
12save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the 
Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; 
because they have wholly followed the 
LORD. 13And the LORD’S anger was 
kindled against Israel, and He made 
them wander to and fro in the 
wilderness forty years, until all the 
generation, that had done evil in the 
sight of the LORD, was consumed. 
14And, behold, ye are risen up in your 
fathers’stead, a brood of sinful men, to 
augment yet the fierce anger of the 
LORD toward Israel. 15For if ye turn 
away from after Him, He will yet 
again leave them in the wilderness; 
and so ye will destroy all this people.’ 

16And they came near unto him, and 
said: ‘We will build sheepfolds here 
for our cattle, and cities for our little 
ones; 17but we ourselves will be ready 
armed to go before the children of 
Israel, until we have brought them 
unto their place; and our little ones 
shall dwell in the fortified cities 
because of the inhabitants of the land. 
18We will not return unto our houses, 
until the children of Israel have 
inherited every man his inheritance. 
19For we will not inherit with them on 
the other side of the Jordan, and 
forward, because our inheritance is 
fallen to us on this side of the Jordan 
eastward.’ 

20And Moses said unto them: ‘If ye 
will do this thing: if ye will arm 
yourselves to go before the LORD to the 
32 




war, 21and every armed man of you 
will pass over the Jordan before the 
LORD, until He hath driven out His 
enemies from before Him, 22and the 
land be subdued before the LORD, and 
ye return afterward; then ye shall be 
clear before the LORD, and before 
Israel, and this land shall be unto you 
for a possession before the LORD. 23But 
if ye will not do so, behold, ye have 
sinned against the LORD; and know ye 
your sin which will find you. 24Build 
you cities for your little ones, and 
folds for your sheep; and do that which 
hath proceeded out of your mouth.’ 

25And the children of Gad and the 
children of Reuben spoke unto Moses, 
saying: ‘Thy servants will do as my 
lord commandeth. 26Our little ones, 
our wives, our flocks, and all our 
cattle, shall be there in the cities of 
Gilead; 27but thy servants will pass 
over, every man that is armed for war, 
before the LORD to battle, as my lord 
saith.’ 

28So Moses gave charge concerning 
them to Eleazar the priest, and to 
Joshua the son of Nun, and to the 
heads of the fathers’houses of the 
tribes of the children of Israel. 29And 
Moses said unto them: ‘If the children 
of Gad and the children of Reuben will 
pass with you over the Jordan, every 
man that is armed to battle, before the 
LORD, and the land shall be subdued 
before you, then ye shall give them the 
land of Gilead for a possession; 30but if 
they will not pass over with you 
armed, they shall have possessions 
among you in the land of Canaan.’ 
31And the children of Gad and the 
children of Reuben answered, saying: 
‘As the LORD hath said unto thy 
servants, so will we do. 32We will pass 
over armed before the LORD into the 
land of Canaan, and the possession of 
our inheritance shall remain with us 
beyond the Jordan.’ 

33And Moses gave unto them, even 
to the children of Gad, and to the 
children of Reuben, and unto the half-
tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, 
the kingdom of Sihon king of the 
Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king 
of Bashan, the land, according to the 
cities thereof with their borders, even 
the cities of the land round about. 
34And the children of Gad built Dibon, 
and Ataroth, and Aroer; 35and Atroth-
shophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah; 
36and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran; 
fortified cities, and folds for sheep. 
37And the children of Reuben built 
Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim; 
38and Nebo, and Baal-meon—their 
names being changed—and Sibmah; 
and gave their names unto the cities 
which they builded. 39And the children 
of Machir the son of Manasseh went to 
Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed 
the Amorites that were therein. 40And 
Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the 
son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein. 
41And Jair the son of Manasseh went 
and took the villages thereof, and 
called them aHavvoth-jair. 42And 

a That is, The villages of Jair. 



Nobah went and took Kenath, and the 
villages thereof, and called it Nobah, 
after his own name. 


These are the stages of the 
children of Israel, by which 
they went forth out of the land of 
Egypt by their hosts under the hand of 
Moses and Aaron. 2And Moses wrote 
their goings forth, stage by stage, by 
the commandment of the LORD; and 
these are their stages at their goings 
forth. 3And they journeyed from 
Rameses in the first month, on the 
fifteenth day of the first month; on the 
morrow after the passover the children 
of Israel went out with a high hand in 
the sight of all the Egyptians, 4while 
the Egyptians were burying them that 
the LORD had smitten among them, 
even all their first-born; upon their 
gods also the LORD executed 
judgments. 5And the children of Israel 
journeyed from Rameses, and pitched 
in Succoth. 6And they journeyed from 
Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which 
is in the edge of the wilderness. 7And 
they journeyed from Etham, and 
turned back unto Pihahiroth, which is 
before Baal-zephon; and they pitched 
before Migdol. 8And they journeyed 
from Penehahiroth, and passed through 
the midst of the sea into the 
wilderness; and they went three 
days’journey in the wilderness of 
Etham, and pitched in Marah. 9And 
they journeyed from Marah, and came 
unto Elim; and in Elim were twelve 
springs of water, and threescore and 
ten palm-trees; and they pitched there. 
10And they journeyed from Elim, and 
pitched by the Red Sea. 11And they 
journeyed from the Red Sea, and 
pitched in the wilderness of Sin. 12And 
they journeyed from the wilderness of 
Sin, and pitched in Dophkah. 13And 
they journeyed from Dophkah, and 
pitched in Alush. 14And they journeyed 
from Alush, and pitched in Rephidim, 
where was no water for the people to 
drink. 15And they journeyed from 
Rephidim, and pitched in the 
wilderness of Sinai. 16And they 
journeyed from the wilderness of 
Sinai, and pitched in Kibroth-
hattaavah. 17And they journeyed from 
Kibroth-hattaavah, and pitched in 
Hazeroth. 18And they journeyed from 
Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah. 
19And they journeyed from Rithmah, 
and pitched in Rimmon-perez. 20And 
they journeyed from Rimmon-perez, 
and pitched in Libnah. 21And they 
journeyed from Libnah, and pitched in 
Rissah. 22And they journeyed from 
Rissah, and pitched in Kehelah. 23And 
they journeyed from Kehelah, and 
pitched in mount Shepher. 24And they 
journeyed from mount Shepher, and 
pitched in Haradah. 25And they 
journeyed from Haradah, and pitched 
in Makheloth. 26And they journeyed 
from Makheloth, and pitched in 
Tahath. 27And they journeyed from 
Tahath, and pitched in Terah. 28And 
they journeyed from Terah, and 
pitched in Mithkah. 29And they 
journeyed from Mithkah, and pitched 
33 




in Hashmonah. 30And they journeyed 
from Hashmonah, and pitched in 
Moseroth. 31And they journeyed from 
Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-jaakan. 
32And they journeyed from Bene-
jaakan, and pitched in Hor-haggidgad. 
33And they journeyed from Hor-
haggidgad, and pitched in Jotbah. 
34And they journeyed from Jotbah, and 
pitched in Abronah. 35And they 
journeyed from Abronah, and pitched 
in Ezion-geber. 36And they journeyed 
from Ezion-geber, and pitched in the 
wilderness of Zin—the same is 
Kadesh. 37And they journeyed from 
Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in 
the edge of the land of Edom.— 38And 
Aaron the priest went up into mount 
Hor at the commandment of the LORD, 
and died there, in the fortieth year after 
the children of Israel were come out of 
the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, 
on the first day of the month. 39And 
Aaron was a hundred and twenty and 
three years old when he died in mount 
Hor. 40And the Canaanite, the king of 
Arad, who dwelt in the South in the 
land of Canaan, heard of the coming of 
the children of Israel.— 41And they 
journeyed from mount Hor, and 
pitched in Zalmonah. 42And they 
journeyed from Zalmonah, and pitched 
in Punon. 43And they journeyed from 
Punon, and pitched in Oboth. 44And 
they journeyed from Oboth, and 
pitched in Ije-abarim, in the border of 
Moab. 45And they journeyed from 
Ijim, and pitched in Dibon-gad. 46And 
they journeyed from Dibon-gad, and 
pitched in Almon-diblathaim. 47And 
they journeyed from Almon-
diblathaim, and pitched in the 
mountains of Abarim, in front of 
Nebo. 48And they journeyed from the 
mountains of Abarim, and pitched in 
the plains of Moab by the Jordan at 
Jericho. 49And they pitched by the 
Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto 
Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab. 

50And the LORD spoke unto Moses in 
the plains of Moab by the Jordan at 
Jericho, saying: 51’Speak unto the 
children of Israel, and say unto them: 
When ye pass over the Jordan into the 
land of Canaan, 52then ye shall drive 
out all the inhabitants of the land from 
before you, and destroy all their 
figured stones, and destroy all their 
molten images, and demolish all their 
high places. 53And ye shall drive out 
the inhabitants of the land, and dwell 
therein; for unto you have I given the 
land to possess it. 54And ye shall 
inherit the land by lot according to 
your families—to the more ye shall 
give the more inheritance, and to the 
fewer thou shalt give the less 
inheritance; wheresoever the lot falleth 
to any man, that shall be his; according 
to the tribes of your fathers shall ye 
inherit. 55But if ye will not drive out 
the inhabitants of the land from before 
you, then shall those that ye let remain 
of them be as thorns in your eyes, and 
as pricks in your sides, and they shall 
harass you in the land wherein ye 
dwell. 56And it shall come to pass, that 


as I thought to do unto them, so will I 
do unto you. 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses, saying: 2’Command 
the children of Israel, and say unto 
them: When ye come into the land of 
Canaan, this shall be the land that shall 
fall unto you for an inheritance, even 
the land of Canaan according to the 
borders thereof. 3Thus your south side 
shall be from the wilderness of Zin 
close by the side of Edom, and your 
south border shall begin at the end of 
the Salt Sea eastward; 4and your 
border shall turn about southward of 
the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass 
along to Zin; and the goings out 
thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-
barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-
addar, and pass along to Azmon; 5and 
the border shall turn about from 
Azmon unto the Brook of Egypt, and 
the goings out thereof shall be at the 
Sea. 6And for the western border, ye 
shall have the Great Sea for a border; 
this shall be your west border. 7And 
this shall be your north border: from 
the Great Sea ye shall mark out your 
line unto mount Hor; 8from mount Hor 
ye shall mark out a line unto the 
entrance to Hamath; and the goings 
out of the border shall be at Zedad; 
9and the border shall go forth to 
Ziphron, and the goings out thereof 
shall be at Hazar-enan; this shall be 
your north border. 10And ye shall mark 
out your line for the east border from 
Hazar-enan to Shepham; 11and the 
border shall go down from Shepham to 
Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the 
border shall go down, and shall strike 
upon the slope of the sea of Chinnereth 
eastward; 12and the border shall go 
down to the Jordan, and the goings out 
thereof shall be at the Salt Sea; this 
shall be your land according to the 
borders thereof round about.’ 

13And Moses commanded the 
children of Israel, saying: ‘This is the 
land wherein ye shall receive 
inheritance by lot, which the LORD hath 
commanded to give unto the nine 
tribes, and to the half-tribe; 14for the 
tribe of the children of Reuben 
according to their fathers’houses, and 
the tribe of the children of Gad 
according to their fathers’houses, have 
received, and the half-tribe of 
Manasseh have received, their 
inheritance; 15the two tribes and the 
half-tribe have received their 
inheritance beyond the Jordan at 
Jericho eastward, toward the sun-
rising.’ 

16And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 17’These are the names of the 
men that shall take possession of the 
land for you: Eleazar the priest, and 
Joshua the son of Nun. 18And ye shall 
take one prince of every tribe, to take 
possession of the land. 19And these are 
the names of the men: of the tribe of 
Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 
20And of the tribe of the children of 
Simeon, Shemuel the son of 
Ammihud. 21Of the tribe of Benjamin, 
Elidad the son of Chislon. 22And of the 
tribe of the children of Dan a prince, 
34 




Bukki the son of Jogli. 23Of the 
children of Joseph: of the tribe of the 
children of Manasseh a prince, 
Hanniel the son of Ephod; 24and of the 
tribe of the children of Ephraim a 
prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. 
25And of the tribe of the children of 
Zebulun a prince, Eli-zaphan the son 
of Parnach. 26And of the tribe of the 
children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel 
the son of Azzan. 27And of the tribe of 
the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud 
the son of Shelomi. 28And of the tribe 
of the children of Naphtali a prince, 
Pedahel the son of Ammihud. 29These 
are they whom the LORD commanded 
to divide the inheritance unto the 
children of Israel in the land of 
Canaan.’ 

And the LORD spoke unto 
Moses in the plains of Moab 
by the Jordan at Jericho, saying: 
2’Command the children of Israel, that 
they give unto the Levites of the 
inheritance of their possession cities to 
dwell in; and open land round about 
the cities shall ye give unto the 
Levites. 3And the cities shall they have 
to dwell in; and their open land shall 
be for their cattle, and for their 
substance, and for all their beasts. 
4And the open land about the cities, 
which ye shall give unto the Levites, 
shall be from the wall of the city and 
outward a thousand cubits round 
about. 5And ye shall measure without 
the city for the east side two thousand 
cubits, and for the south side two 
thousand cubits, and for the west side 
two thousand cubits, and for the north 
side two thousand cubits, the city 
being in the midst. This shall be to 
them the open land about the cities. 
6And the cities which ye shall give 
unto the Levites, they shall be the six 
cities of refuge, which ye shall give for 
the manslayer to flee thither; and 
beside them ye shall give forty and 
two cities. 7All the cities which ye 
shall give to the Levites shall be forty 
and eight cities: them shall ye give 
with the open land about them. 8And 
concerning the cities which ye shall 
give of the possession of the children 
of Israel, from the many ye shall take 
many, and from the few ye shall take 
few; each tribe according to its 
inheritance which it inheriteth shall 
give of its cities unto the Levites.’ 

9And the LORD spoke unto Moses, 
saying: 10’Speak unto the children of 
Israel, and say unto them: When ye 
pass over the Jordan into the land of 
Canaan, 11then ye shall appoint you 
cities to be cities of refuge for you, 
that the manslayer that killeth any 
person through error may flee thither. 
12And the cities shall be unto you for 
refuge from the avenger, that the 
manslayer die not, until he stand 
before the congregation for judgment. 
13And as to the cities which ye shall 
give, there shall be for you six cities of 
refuge. 14Ye shall give three cities 
beyond the Jordan, and three cities 
shall ye give in the land of Canaan; 
they shall be cities of refuge. 15For the 
children of Israel, and for the stranger 
35 




and for the settler among them, shall 
these six cities be for refuge, that 
every one that killeth any person 
through error may flee thither. 16But if 
he smote him with an instrument of 
iron, so that he died, he is a murderer; 
the murderer shall surely be put to 
death. 17And if he smote him with a 
stone in the hand, whereby a man may 
die, and he died, he is a murderer; the 
murderer shall surely be put to death. 
18Or if he smote him with a weapon of 
wood in the hand, whereby a man may 
die, and he died, he is a murderer; the 
murderer shall surely be put to death. 
19The avenger of blood shall himself 
put the murderer to death; when he 
meeteth him, he shall put him to death. 
20And if he thrust him of hatred, or 
hurled at him any thing, lying in wait, 
so that he died; 21or in enmity smote 
him with his hand, that he died; he that 
smote him shall surely be put to death: 
he is a murderer; the avenger of blood 
shall put the murderer to death when 
he meeteth him. 22But if he thrust him 
suddenly without enmity, or hurled 
upon him any thing without lying in 
wait, 23or with any stone, whereby a 
man may die, seeing him not, and cast 
it upon him, so that he died, and he 
was not his enemy, neither sought his 
harm; 24then the congregation shall 
judge between the smiter and the 
avenger of blood according to these 
ordinances; 25and the congregation 
shall deliver the manslayer out of the 
hand of the avenger of blood, and the 
congregation shall restore him to his 
city of refuge, whither he was fled; 
and he shall dwell therein until the 
death of the high priest, who was 
anointed with the holy oil. 26But if the 
manslayer shall at any time go beyond 
the border of his city of refuge, 
whither he fleeth; 27and the avenger of 
blood find him without the border of 
his city of refuge, and the avenger of 
blood slay the manslayer; there shall 
be no bloodguiltiness for him; 
28because he must remain in his city of 
refuge until the death of the high 
priest; but after the death of the high 
priest the manslayer may return into 
the land of his possession. 29And these 
things shall be for a statute of 
judgment unto you throughout your 
generations in all your dwellings. 
30Whoso killeth any person, the 
murderer shall be slain at the mouth of 
witnesses; but one witness shall not 
testify against any person that he die. 
31Moreover ye shall take no ransom for 
the life of a murderer, that is guilty of 
death; but he shall surely be put to 
death. 32And ye shall take no ransom 
for him that is fled to his city of 
refuge, that he should come again to 
dwell in the land, until the death of the 
priest. 33So ye shall not pollute the 
land wherein ye are; for blood, it 
polluteth the land; and no expiation 
can be made for the land for the blood 
that is shed therein, but by the blood of 
him that shed it. 34And thou shalt not 
defile the land which ye inhabit, in the 
midst of which I dwell; for I the LORD 


dwell in the midst of the children of 
Israel.’ 

 

36 



And the heads of the 
fathers’houses of the family of 
the children of Gilead, the son of 
Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the 
families of the sons of Joseph, came 
near, and spoke before Moses, and 
before the princes, the heads of the 
fathers’houses of the children of Israel; 
2and they said: ‘The LORD commanded 
my lord to give the land for inheritance 
by lot to the children of Israel; and my 
lord was commanded by the LORD to 
give the inheritance of Zelophehad our 
brother unto his daughters. 3And if 
they be married to any of the sons of 
the other tribes of the children of 
Israel, then will their inheritance be 
taken away from the inheritance of our 
fathers, and will be added to the 
inheritance of the tribe whereunto they 
shall belong; so will it be taken away 
from the lot of our inheritance. 4And 
when the jubilee of the children of 
Israel shall be, then will their 
inheritance be added unto the 
inheritance of the tribe whereunto they 
shall belong; so will their inheritance 
be taken away from the inheritance of 
the tribe of our fathers.’ 5And Moses 
commanded the children of Israel 
according to the word of the LORD, 
saying: ‘The tribe of the sons of 
Joseph speaketh right. 6This is the 
thing which the LORD hath commanded 
concerning the daughters of 
Zelophehad, saying: Let them be 
married to whom they think best; only 
into the family of the tribe of their 
father shall they be married. 7So shall 
no inheritance of the children of Israel 
remove from tribe to tribe; for the 
children of Israel shall cleave every 
one to the inheritance of the tribe of 
his fathers. 8And every daughter, that 
possesseth an inheritance in any tribe 
of the children of Israel, shall be wife 
unto one of the family of the tribe of 
her father, that the children of Israel 
may possess every man the inheritance 
of his fathers. 9So shall no inheritance 
remove from one tribe to another tribe; 
for the tribes of the children of Israel 
shall cleave each one to its own 
inheritance.’ 10Even as the LORD 
commanded Moses, so did the 
daughters of Zelophehad. 11For 
Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and 
Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of 
Zelophehad, were married unto their 
father’s brothers’sons. 12They were 
married into the families of the sons of 
Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their 
inheritance remained in the tribe of the 
family of their father. 

13These are the commandments and 
the ordinances, which the LORD 
commanded by the hand of Moses 
unto the children of Israel in the plains 
of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
