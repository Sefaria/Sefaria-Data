HOSEA 


The word of the LORD that came 
unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in 
the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and 
Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the 
days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, 
king of Israel. 

2When the LORD spoke at first with 
Hosea, the LORD said unto Hosea: ‘Go, 
take unto thee a wife of harlotry and 
children of harlotry; for the land doth 
commit great harlotry, departing from 
the LORD.’ 3So he went and took 
Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and 
she conceived, and bore him a son. 
4And the LORD said unto him: ‘Call his 
name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and 
I will visit the blood of Jezreel upon 
the house of Jehu, and will cause to 
cease the kingdom of the house of 
Israel. 5And it shall come to pass at 
that day, that I will break the bow of 
Israel in the valley of Jezreel.’ 6And 
she conceived again, and bore a 
daughter. And He said unto him: ‘Call 
her name aLo-ruhamah; for I will no 
more have compassion upon the house 
of Israel, that I should in any wise 
pardon them. 7But I will have 
compassion upon the house of Judah, 
and will save them by the LORD their 
God, and will not save them by bow, 

a That is, That hath not obtained 
compassion. 

nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by 
horses, nor by horsemen.’ 8Now when 
she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she 
conceived, and bore a son. 9And He 
said: ‘Call his name bLo-ammi; for ye 
are not My people, and I will not be 
yours.’ 

b That is, Not My people. 

c That is, My people. 

d That is, That hath obtained 
compassion. 

 

Yet the number of the children of 
Israel shall be as the sand of the 
sea, which cannot be measured nor 
numbered; and it shall come to pass 
that, instead of that which was said 
unto them: ‘Ye are not My people’, it 
shall be said unto them: ‘Ye are the 
children of the living God.’ 2And the 
children of Judah and the children of 
Israel shall be gathered together, and 
they shall appoint themselves one 
head, and shall go up out of the land; 
for great shall be the day of Jezreel. 
3Say ye unto your brethren: ‘cAmmi’; 
and to your sisters, ‘dRuhamah.’ 

 

4Plead with your mother, plead; 

For she is not My wife, neither am I 
her husband; 

And let her put away her harlotries 
from her face, 


And her adulteries from between her 
breasts; 

5Lest I strip her naked, 

And set her as in the day that she 
was born, 

And make her as a wilderness, 

And set her like a dry land, 

And slay her with thirst. 

6And I will not have compassion 
upon her children; 

For they are children of harlotry. 

7For their mother hath played the 
harlot, 

She that conceived them hath done 
shamefully; 

For she said: ‘I will go after my 
lovers, 

That give me my bread and my 
water, 

My wool and my flax, mine oil and 
my drink.’ 

8Therefore, behold, I will hedge up 
thy way with thorns, 

And I will make a wall against her, 

That she shall not find her paths. 

9And she shall run after her lovers, 
but she shall not overtake them, 

And she shall seek them, but shall 
not find them; 

Then shall she say: ‘I will go and 
return to my first husband; 

For then was it better with me than 
now.’ 

10For she did not know that it was I 
that gave her 

The corn, and the wine, and the oil, 

And multiplied unto her silver and 
gold, 

Which they used for Baal. 

11Therefore will I take back My corn 
in the time thereof, 

And My wine in the season thereof, 

And will snatch away My wool and 
My flax 

Given to cover her nakedness. 

12And now will I uncover her shame 
in the sight of her lovers, 

And none shall deliver her out of 
My hand. 

13I will also cause all her mirth to 
cease, 

Her feasts, her new moons, and her 
sabbaths, 

And all her appointed seasons. 

14And I will lay waste her vines and 
her fig-trees, 

Whereof she hath said: ‘These are 
my hire 

That my lovers have given me’; 

And I will make them a forest, 

And the beasts of the field shall eat 
them. 

15And I will visit upon her the days 
of the Baalim, 

Wherein she offered unto them, 

And decked herself with her ear-
rings and her jewels, 

And went after her lovers, 

And forgot Me, saith the LORD. 

16Therefore, behold, I will allure 
her, 

And bring her into the wilderness, 

And speak tenderly unto her. 

17And I will give her her vineyards 
from thence, 


And the valley of aAchor for a door 
of hope; 

a That is, Troubling. 

b That is, My husband. 

c That is, My master. 

And she shall respond there, as in 
the days of her youth, 

And as in the day when she came up 
out of the land of Egypt. 

 

18And it shall be at that day, saith 
the LORD, 

That thou shalt call Me bIshi, 

And shalt call Me no more cBaali. 

19For I will take away the names of 
the Baalim out of her mouth, 

And they shall no more be 
mentioned by their name. 

20And in that day will I make a 
covenant for them 

With the beasts of the field, and 
with the fowls of heaven, 

And with the creeping things of the 
ground; 

And I will break the bow and the 
sword and the battle out of the 
land, 

And will make them to lie down 
safely. 

21And I will betroth thee unto Me 
for ever; 

Yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in 
righteousness, and in justice, 

And in lovingkindness, and in 
compassion. 

22And I will betroth thee unto Me in 
faithfulness; 

And thou shalt know the LORD. 

23And it shall come to pass in that 
day, 

I will respond, saith the LORD, I will 
respond to the heavens, 

And they shall respond to the earth; 

24And the earth shall respond to the 
corn, and the wine, and the oil; 

And they shall respond to dJezreel. 

d That is, Whom God soweth. 

25And I will sow her unto Me in the 
land; 

And I will have compassion upon 
her that had not obtained 
compassion; 

And I will say to them that were not 
My people: ‘Thou art My 
people’; 

And they shall say: ‘Thou art my 
God.’ 

 

3 



And the LORD said unto me: ‘Go 
yet, love a woman beloved of her 
friend and an adulteress, even as the 
LORD loveth the children of Israel, 
though they turn unto other gods, and 
love cakes of raisins. 2So I bought her 
to me for fifteen pieces of silver and a 
homer of barley, and a half-homer of 
barley; 3and I said unto her: ‘Thou 
shalt sit solitary for me many days; 
thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou 
shalt not be any man’s wife; nor will I 
be thine.’ 4For the children of Israel 
shall sit solitary many days without 
king, and without prince, and without 
sacrifice, and without pillar, and 
without ephod or teraphim; 5afterward 
shall the children of Israel return, and 


seek the LORD their God, and David 
their king; and shall come trembling 
unto the LORD and to His goodness in 
the end of days. 

 

Hear the word of the LORD, ye 
children of Israel! 

For the LORD hath a controversy 
with the inhabitants of the land, 

Because there is no truth, nor mercy, 

Nor knowledge of God in the land. 

2Swearing and lying, and killing, 
and stealing, and committing 
adultery! 

They break all bounds, and blood 
toucheth blood. 

3Therefore doth the land mourn, 

And every one that dwelleth therein 
doth languish, 

With the beasts of the field, and the 
fowls of heaven; 

Yea, the fishes of the sea also are 
taken away. 

 

4Yet let no man strive, neither let 
any man reprove; 

For thy people are as they that strive 
with the priest. 

5Therefore shalt thou stumble in the 
day, 

And the prophet also shall stumble 
with thee in the night; 

And I will destroy thy mother. 

6My people are destroyed for lack of 
knowledge; 

Because thou hast rejected 
knowledge, 

I will also reject thee, that thou shalt 
be no priest to Me; 

Seeing thou hast forgotten the law 
of thy God, 

I also will forget thy children. 

 

7The more they were increased, the 
more they sinned against Me; 

I will change their glory into shame. 

8They feed on the sin of My people, 

And set their heart on their iniquity. 

9And it is like people, like priest; 

And I will punish him for his ways, 

And will recompense him his 
doings. 

10And they shall eat, and not have 
enough, 

They shall commit harlotry, and 
shall not increase; 

Because they have left off to take 
heed to the LORD. 

11Harlotry, wine, and new wine take 
away the heart. 

12My people ask counsel at their 
stock, 

And their staff declareth unto them; 

For the spirit of harlotry hath caused 
them to err, 

And they have gone astray from 
under their God. 

13They sacrifice upon the tops of the 
mountains, 

And offer upon the hills, 

Under oaks and poplars and 
terebinths, 

Because the shadow thereof is good; 

Therefore your daughters commit 
harlotry, 

And your daughters-in-law commit 
adultery. 
4 




14I will not punish your daughters 
when they commit harlotry, 

Nor your daughters-in-law when 
they commit adultery; 

For they themselves consort with 
lewd women, 

And they sacrifice with harlots; 

And the people that is without 
understanding is distraught. 

 

15Though thou, Israel, play the 
harlot, 

Yet let not Judah become guilty; 

And come not ye unto Gilgal, 

Neither go ye up to Beth-aven, 

Nor swear: ‘As the LORD liveth.’ 

16For Israel is stubborn like a 
stubborn heifer; 

Now shall the LORD feed them as a 
lamb in a large place? 

17Ephraim is joined to idols; 

Let him alone. 

18When their carouse is over, 

They take to harlotry; 

Her rulers deeply love dishonour. 

19The wind hath bound her up in her 
skirts; 

And they shall be ashamed because 
of their sacrifices. 

 

Hear this, O ye priests, 

And attend, ye house of Israel, 

And give ear, O house of the king, 

For unto you pertaineth the 
judgment; 

For ye have been a snare on Mizpah, 

And a net spread upon Tabor. 

2And they that fall away are gone 
deep in making slaughter; 

And I am rejected of them all. 

3I, even I, know Ephraim, 

And Israel is not hid from Me; 

For now, O Ephraim, thou hast 
committed harlotry, 

Israel is defiled. 

4Their doings will not suffer them 

To return unto their God; 

For the spirit of harlotry is within 
them, 

And they know not the LORD. 

5But the pride of Israel shall testify 
to his face; 

And Israel and Ephraim shall 
stumble in their iniquity, 

Judah also shall stumble with them. 

6With their flocks and with their 
herds they shall go 

To seek the LORD, but they shall not 
find Him; 

He hath withdrawn Himself from 
them. 

7They have dealt treacherously 
against the LORD, 

For they have begotten strange 
children; 

Now shall the new moon devour 
them with their portions. 

 

8Blow ye the horn in Gibeah, 

And the trumpet in Ramah; 

Sound an alarm at Beth-aven: 

‘Behind thee, O Benjamin! ’ 

9Ephraim shall be desolate in the 
day of rebuke; 

Among the tribes of Israel do I 
make known that which shall 
surely be. 
5 




10The princes of Judah are like them 
that remove the landmark; 

I will pour out My wrath upon them 
like water. 

11Oppressed is Ephraim, crushed in 
his right; 

Because he willingly walked after 
filth. 

12Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a 
moth, 

And to the house of Judah as 
rottenness. 

13And when Ephraim saw his 
sickness, 

And Judah his wound, 

Ephraim went to Assyria, 

And sent to King Contentious; 

But he is not able to heal you, 

Neither shall he cure you of your 
wound. 

14For I will be unto Ephraim as a 
lion, 

And as a young lion to the house of 
Judah; 

I, even I, will tear and go away, 

I will take away, and there shall be 
none to deliver. 

15I will go and return to My place, 

Till they acknowledge their guilt, 
and seek My face; 

In their trouble they will seek Me 
earnestly: 

’Come, and let us return unto the 
LORD; 

For He hath torn, and He will heal 
us, 

He hath smitten, and He will bind us 
up. 

2After two days will He revive us, 

On the third day He will raise us up, 
that we may live in His presence. 

3And let us know, eagerly strive to 
know the LORD, 

His going forth is sure as the 
morning; 

And He shall come unto us as the 
rain, 

As the latter rain that watereth the 
earth.’ 

 

4O Ephraim, what shall I do unto 
thee? 

O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? 

For your goodness is as a morning 
cloud, 

And as the dew that early passeth 
away. 

5Therefore have I hewed them by 
the prophets, 

I have slain them by the words of 
My mouth; 

And thy judgment goeth forth as the 
light. 

6For I desire mercy, and not 
sacrifice, 

And the knowledge of God rather 
than burnt-offerings. 

 

7But they like men have 
transgressed the covenant; 

There have they dealt treacherously 
against Me. 

8Gilead is a city of them that work 
iniquity, 

It is covered with footprints of 
blood. 

9And as troops of robbers wait for a 
man, 
6 




So doth the company of priests; 

They murder in the way toward 
Shechem; 

Yea, they commit enormity. 

10In the house of Israel I have seen a 
horrible thing; 

There harlotry is found in Ephraim, 
Israel is defiled. 

11Also, O Judah, there is a harvest 
appointed for thee! 

 

When I would turn the captivity of 
My people, 

When I would heal Israel, 

Then is the iniquity of Ephraim 
uncovered, 

And the wickedness of Samaria, 

For they commit falsehood; 

And the thief entereth in, 

And the troop of robbers maketh a 
raid without. 

2And let them not say to their 
heart— 

I remember all their wickedness; 

Now their own doings have beset 
them about, 

They are before My face. 

3They make the king glad with their 
wickedness, 

And the princes with their lies. 

4They are all adulterers, 

As an oven heated by the baker, 

Who ceaseth to stir 

From the kneading of the dough 
until it be leavened. 

5On the day of our king 

The princes make him sick with the 
heat of wine, 

He stretcheth out his hand with 
scorners. 

6For they have made ready their 
heart like an oven, while they lie 
in wait; 

Their baker sleepeth all the night, 

In the morning it burneth as a 
flaming fire. 

7They are all hot as an oven, 

And devour their judges; 

All their kings are fallen, 

There is none among them that 
calleth unto Me. 

 

8Ephraim, he mixeth himself with 
the peoples; 

Ephraim is become a cake not 
turned. 

9Strangers have devoured his 
strength, 

And he knoweth it not; 

Yea, gray hairs are here and there 
upon him, 

And he knoweth it not. 

10And the pride of Israel testifieth to 
his face; 

But they have not returned unto the 
LORD their God, 

Nor sought Him, for all this. 

11And Ephraim is become like a 
silly dove, without understanding; 

They call unto Egypt, they go to 
Assyria. 

12Even as they go, I will spread My 
net upon them; 

I will bring them down as the fowls 
of the heaven; 
7 




I will chastise them, as their 
congregation hath been made to 
hear. 

13Woe unto them! for they have 
strayed from Me; 

Destruction unto them! for they 
have transgressed against Me; 

Shall I then redeem them, 

Seeing they have spoken lies against 
Me? 

14And they have not cried unto Me 
with their heart, 

Though they wail upon their beds; 

They assemble themselves for corn 
and wine, they rebel against Me. 

15Though I have trained and 
strengthened their arms, 

Yet do they devise evil against Me. 

16They return, but not upwards; 

They are become like a deceitful 
bow; 

Their princes shall fall by the sword 
for the rage of their tongue; 

This shall be their derision in the 
land of Egypt. 

 

Set the horn to thy mouth. 

As a vulture he cometh against 
the house of the LORD; 

Because they have transgressed My 
covenant, 

And trespassed against My law. 

2Will they cry unto Me: 

‘My God, we Israel know Thee’? 

3Israel hath cast off that which is 
good; 

The enemy shall pursue him. 

4They have set up kings, but not 
from Me, 

They have made princes, and I knew 
it not; 

Of their silver and their gold have 
they made them idols, 

That they may be cut off. 

5Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off; 

Mine anger is kindled against them; 

How long will it be ere they attain to 
innocency? 

6For from Israel is even this: 

The craftsman made it, and it is no 
God; 

Yea, the calf of Samaria shall be 
broken in shivers. 

7For they sow the wind, and they 
shall reap the whirlwind; 

It hath no stalk, the bud that shall 
yield no meal; 

If so be it yield, strangers shall 
swallow it up. 

 

8Israel is swallowed up; 

Now are they become among the 
nations 

As a vessel wherein is no value. 

9For they are gone up to Assyria, 

Like a wild ass alone by himself; 

Ephraim hath hired lovers. 

10Yea, though they hire among the 
nations, 

Now will I gather them up; 

And they begin to be minished 

By reason of the burden of king and 
princes. 

11For Ephraim hath multiplied altars 
to sin, 

Yea, altars have been unto him to 
sin. 
8 




12Though I write for him never so 
many things of My Law, 

They are accounted as a stranger’s. 

13As for the sacrifices that are made 
by fire unto Me, 

Let them sacrifice flesh and eat it, 

For the LORD accepteth them not. 

Now will He remember their 
iniquity, and punish their sins; 

They shall return to Egypt. 

14For Israel hath forgotten his 
Maker, 

And builded palaces, 

And Judah hath multiplied fortified 
cities; 

But I will send a fire upon his cities, 

And it shall devour the castles 
thereof. 

 

Rejoice not, O Israel, unto 
exultation, like the peoples, 

For thou hast gone astray from thy 
God, 

Thou hast loved a harlot’s hire upon 
every corn-floor. 

2The threshing-floor and the wine-
press shall not feed them, 

And the new wine shall fail her. 

3They shall not dwell in the LORD’S 
land; 

But Ephraim shall return to Egypt, 

And they shall eat unclean food in 
Assyria. 

4They shall not pour out wine-
offerings to the LORD, 

Neither shall they be pleasing unto 
Him; 

Their sacrifices shall be unto them 
as the bread of mourners, 

All that eat thereof shall be polluted; 

For their bread shall be for their 
appetite, 

It shall not come into the house of 
the LORD. 

5What will ye do in the day of the 
appointed season, 

And in the day of the feast of the 
LORD? 

6For, lo, they are gone away from 
destruction, 

Yet Egypt shall gather them up, 

Memphis shall bury them; 

Their precious treasures of silver, 
nettles shall possess them, 

Thorns shall be in their tents. 

7The days of visitation are come, 

The days of recompense are come, 

Israel shall know it. 

The prophet is a fool, the man of the 
spirit is mad! 

For the multitude of thine iniquity, 
the enmity is great. 

8Ephraim is a watchman with my 
God; 

As for the prophet, a fowler’s snare 
is in all his ways, 

And enmity in the house of his God. 

9They have deeply corrupted 
themselves, 

As in the days of Gibeah; 

He will remember their iniquity, 

He will punish their sins. 

 

10I found Israel like grapes in the 
wilderness, 

I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in 
the fig-tree at her first season; 
9 




But so soon as they came to Baal-
peor, 

They separated themselves unto the 
shameful thing, 

And became detestable like that 
which they loved. 

11As for Ephraim, their glory shall 
fly away like a bird; 

There shall be no birth, and none 
with child, and no conception. 

12Yea, though they bring up their 
children, 

Yet will I bereave them, that there 
be not a man left; 

Yea, woe also to them when I depart 
from them! 

13Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, 
is planted in a pleasant place; 

But Ephraim shall bring forth his 
children to the slayer. 

14Give them, O LORD, whatsoever 
Thou wilt give; 

Give them a miscarrying womb and 
dry breasts. 

15All their wickedness is in Gilgal, 

For there I hated them; 

Because of the wickedness of their 
doings 

I will drive them out of My house; 

I will love them no more, 

All their princes are rebellious. 

16Ephraim is smitten, 

Their root is dried up, 

They shall bear no fruit; 

Yea, though they bring forth, 

Yet will I slay the beloved fruit of 
their womb. 

17My God will cast them away, 

Because they did not hearken unto 
Him; 

And they shall be wanderers among 
the nations. 

 

Israel was a luxuriant vine, 
Which put forth fruit freely: 

As his fruit increased, 

He increased his altars; 

The more goodly his land was, 

The more goodly were his pillars. 

2Their heart is divided; 

Now shall they bear their guilt; 

He will break down their altars, 

He will spoil their pillars. 

3Surely now shall they say: 

‘We have no king; 

For we feared not the LORD; 

And the king, what can he do for 
us?’ 

4They speak words, 

They swear falsely, they make 
covenants; 

Thus judgment springeth up as 
hemlock 

In the furrows of the field. 

5The inhabitants of Samaria shall be 
in dread 

For the calves of Beth-aven; 

For the people thereof shall mourn 
over it, 

And the priests thereof shall tremble 
for it, 

For its glory, because it is departed 
from it. 

6It also shall be carried unto 
Assyria, 

For a present to King Contentious; 

Ephraim shall receive shame, 
10 




And Israel shall be ashamed of his 
own counsel. 

7As for Samaria, her king is cut off, 

As foam upon the water. 

8The high places also of Aven shall 
be destroyed, 

Even the sin of Israel. 

The thorn and the thistle shall come 
up on their altars; 

And they shall say to the mountains: 
‘Cover us’, 

And to the hills: ‘Fall on us.’ 

 

9From the days of Gibeah thou hast 
sinned, O Israel; 

There they stood; 

No battle was to overtake them in 
Gibeah, 

Nor the children of arrogancy. 

10When it is My desire, I will 
chastise them; 

And the peoples shall be gathered 
against them, 

When they are yoked to their two 
rings. 

11And Ephraim is a heifer well 
broken, 

That loveth to thresh, 

And I have passed over upon her 
fair neck; 

I will make Ephraim to ride, Judah 
shall plow, 

Jacob shall break his clods. 

12Sow to yourselves according to 
righteousness, 

Reap according to mercy, 

Break up your fallow ground; 

For it is time to seek the LORD, 

Till He come and cause 
righteousness to rain upon you. 

13Ye have plowed wickedness, ye 
have reaped iniquity, 

Ye have eaten the fruit of lies; 

For thou didst trust in thy way, 

In the multitude of thy mighty men. 

14Therefore shall a tumult arise 
among thy hosts, 

And all thy fortresses shall be 
spoiled, 

As Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in 
the day of battle; 

The mother was dashed in pieces 
with her children. 

15So hath Beth-el done unto you 

Because of your great wickedness; 

At daybreak is the king of Israel 
utterly cut off. 

 

When Israel was a child, then I 
loved him, 

And out of Egypt I called My son. 

2The more they called them, the 
more they went from them; 

They sacrificed unto the Baalim, 

And offered to graven images. 

3And I, I taught Ephraim to walk, 

Taking them by their arms; 

But they knew not that I healed 
them. 

4I drew them with cords of a man, 

With bands of love; 

And I was to them as they that take 
off the yoke on their jaws, 

And I fed them gently. 

5He shall not return into the land of 
Egypt, 

But the Assyrian shall be his king, 
11 




Because they refused to return. 

6And the sword shall fall upon his 
cities, 

And shall consume his bars, and 
devour them, 

Because of their own counsels. 

 

7And My people are in suspense 
about returning to Me; 

And though they call them upwards, 

None at all will lift himself up. 

8How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? 

How shall I surrender thee, Israel? 

How shall I make thee as Admah? 

How shall I set thee as Zeboim? 

My heart is turned within Me, 

My compassions are kindled 
together. 

9I will not execute the fierceness of 
Mine anger, 

I will not return to destroy Ephraim; 

For I am God, and not man, 

The Holy One in the midst of thee; 

And I will not come in fury. 

10They shall walk after the LORD, 

Who shall roar like a lion; 

For He shall roar, 

And the children shall come 
trembling from the west. 

11They shall come trembling as a 
bird out of Egypt, 

And as a dove out of the land of 
Assyria; 

And I will make them to dwell in 
their houses, saith the LORD. 

 

Ephraim compasseth Me about 
with lies, 

And the house of Israel with deceit; 

And Judah is yet wayward towards 
God, 

And towards the Holy One who is 
faithful. 

2Ephraim striveth after wind, and 
followeth after the east wind; 

All the day he multiplieth lies and 
desolation; 

And they make a covenant with 
Assyria, 

And oil is carried into Egypt. 

3The LORD hath also a controversy 
with Judah, 

And will punish Jacob according to 
his ways, 

According to his doings will He 
recompense him. 

4In the womb he took his brother by 
the heel, 

And by his strength he strove with a 
godlike being; 

5So he strove with an angel, and 
prevailed; 

He wept, and made supplication 
unto him; 

At Beth-el he would find him, 

And there he would speak with us; 

6But the LORD, the God of hosts, 

The LORD is His name. 

7Therefore turn thou to thy God; 

Keep mercy and justice, 

And wait for thy God continually. 

8As for the trafficker, the balances 
of deceit are in his hand. 

He loveth to oppress. 

9And Ephraim said: ‘Surely I am 
become rich, 

I have found me wealth; 12 




In all my labours they shall find in 
me 

No iniquity that were sin.’ 

10But I am the LORD thy God 

From the land of Egypt; 

I will yet again make thee to dwell 
in tents, 

As in the days of the appointed 
season. 

11I have also spoken unto the 
prophets, 

And I have multiplied visions; 

And by the ministry of the prophets 
have I used similitudes. 

12If Gilead be given to iniquity 

Becoming altogether vanity, 

In Gilgal they sacrifice unto 
bullocks; 

Yea, their altars shall be as heaps 

In the furrows of the field. 

 

13And Jacob fled into the field of 
Aram, 

And Israel served for a wife, 

And for a wife he kept sheep. 

14And by a prophet the LORD brought 
Israel up out of Egypt, 

And by a prophet was he kept. 

15Ephraim hath provoked most 
bitterly; 

Therefore shall his blood be cast 
upon him, 

And his reproach shall his Lord 
return unto him. 

 

When Ephraim spoke, there 
was trembling, 

He exalted himself in Israel; 

But when he became guilty through 
Baal, he died. 

2And now they sin more and more, 

And have made them molten images 
of their silver, 

According to their own 
understanding, even idols, 

All of them the work of the 
craftsmen; 

Of them they say: 

‘They that sacrifice men kiss 
calves.’ 

3Therefore they shall be as the 
morning cloud, 

And as the dew that early passeth 
away, 

As the chaff that is driven with the 
wind out of the threshing-floor, 

And as the smoke out of the 
window. 

 

4Yet I am the LORD thy God 

From the land of Egypt; 

And thou knowest no God but Me, 

And beside Me there is no saviour. 

5I did know thee in the wilderness, 

In the land of great drought. 

6When they were fed, they became 
full, 

They were filled, and their heart was 
exalted; 

Therefore have they forgotten Me. 

7Therefore am I become unto them 
as a lion; 

As a leopard will I watch by the 
way; 

8I will meet them as a bear that is 
bereaved of her whelps, 
13 




And will rend the enclosure of their 
heart; 

And there will I devour them like a 
lioness; 

The wild beast shall tear them. 

 

9It is thy destruction, O Israel, 

That thou art against Me, against thy 
help. 

10Ho, now, thy king, 

That he may save thee in all thy 
cities! 

And thy judges, of whom thou 
saidst: 

‘Give me a king and princes! ’ 

11I give thee a king in Mine anger, 

And take him away in My wrath. 

 

12The iniquity of Ephraim is bound 
up; 

His sin is laid up in store. 

13The throes of a travailing woman 
shall come upon him; 

He is an unwise son; 

For it is time he should not tarry 

In the place of the breaking forth of 
children. 

14Shall I ransom them from the 
power of the nether-world? 

Shall I redeem them from death? 

Ho, thy plagues, O death! 

Ho, thy destruction, O netherworld! 

Repentance be hid from Mine eyes! 

15For though he be fruitful among 
the reed-plants, 

An east wind shall come, the wind 
of the LORD coming up from the 
wilderness, 

And his spring shall become dry, 
and his fountain shall be dried up; 

He shall spoil the treasure of all 
precious vessels. 

 

Samaria shall bear her guilt, 

For she hath rebelled against 
her God; 

They shall fall by the sword; 

Their infants shall be dashed in 
pieces, 

And their women with child shall be 
ripped up. 

2Return, O Israel, unto the LORD thy 
God; 

For thou hast stumbled in thine 
iniquity. 

3Take with you words, 

And return unto the LORD; 

Say unto Him: ‘Forgive all iniquity, 

And accept that which is good; 

So will we render for bullocks the 
offering of our lips. 

4Asshur shall not save us; 

We will not ride upon horses; 

Neither will we call any more the 
work of our hands our gods; 

For in Thee the fatherless findeth 
mercy.’ 

5I will heal their backsliding, 

I will love them freely; 

For Mine anger is turned away from 
him. 

6I will be as the dew unto Israel; 

He shall blossom as the lily, 

And cast forth his roots as Lebanon. 

7His branches shall spread, 

And his beauty shall be as the olive-
tree, 
14 




And his fragrance as Lebanon. 

8They that dwell under his shadow 
shall again 

Make corn to grow, 

And shall blossom as the vine; 

The scent thereof shall be as the 
wine of Lebanon. 

9Ephraim [shall say]: 

‘What have I to do any more with 
idols?’ 

As for Me, I respond and look on 
him; 

I am like a leafy cypress-tree; 

From Me is thy fruit found. 

10Whoso is wise, let him understand 
these things, 

Whoso is prudent, let him know 
them. 

For the ways of the LORD are right, 

And the just do walk in them; 

But transgressors do stumble 
therein.
