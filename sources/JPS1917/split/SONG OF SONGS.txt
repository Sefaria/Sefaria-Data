SONG OF SONGS 

 

THE song of songs, which is 
Solomon’s. 

 

2Let him kiss me with the kisses of 
his mouth— 

For thy love is better than wine. 

3Thine ointments have a goodly 
fragrance; 

Thy name is as ointment poured 
forth; 

Therefore do the maidens love thee. 

4Draw me, we will run after thee; 

The king hath brought me into his 
chambers; 

We will be glad and rejoice in thee, 

We will find thy love more fragrant 
than wine! 

Sincerely do they love thee. 

5’I am black, but comely, 

O ye daughters of Jerusalem, 

As the tents of Kedar, 

As the curtains of Solomon. 

6Look not upon me, that I am 
swarthy, 

That the sun hath tanned me; 

My mother’s sons were incensed 
against me, 

They made me keeper of the 
vineyards; 

But mine own vineyard have I not 
kept.’ 

7Tell me, O thou whom my soul 
loveth, 

Where thou feedest, where thou 
makest thy flock to rest at noon; 

For why should I be as one that 
veileth herself 

Beside the flocks of thy 
companions? 

8If thou know not, O thou fairest 
among women, 

Go thy way forth by the footsteps of 
the flock 

And feed thy kids, beside the 
shepherds’tents. 

9I have compared thee, O my love, 

To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots. 

10Thy cheeks are comely with 
circlets, 

Thy neck with beads. 

11We will make thee circlets of gold 

With studs of silver. 

 

12While the king sat at his table, 

My spikenard sent forth its 
fragrance. 

13My beloved is unto me as a bag of 
myrrh, 

That lieth betwixt my breasts. 

14My beloved is unto me as a cluster 
of henna 

In the vineyards of En-gedi. 

 

15Behold, thou art fair, my love; 
behold, thou art fair; 

Thine eyes are as doves. 
1 




16Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, 
yea, pleasant; 

Also our couch is leafy. 

17The beams of our houses are 
cedars, 

And our panels are cypresses. 

 

2 

3 



I am a rose of Sharon, 

A lily of the valleys. 

 

2As a lily among thorns, 

So is my love among the daughters. 

3As an apple-tree among the trees of 
the wood, 

So is my beloved among the sons. 

Under its shadow I delighted to sit, 

And its fruit was sweet to my taste. 

4He hath brought me to the 
banqueting-house, 

And his banner over me is love. 

5’Stay ye me with dainties, refresh 
me with apples; 

For I am love-sick.’ 

6Let his left hand be under my head, 

And his right hand embrace me. 

7’I adjure you, O daughters of 
Jerusalem, 

By the gazelles, and by the hinds of 
the field, 

That ye awaken not, nor stir up love, 
until it please.’ 

8Hark! my beloved! behold, he 
cometh, 

Leaping upon the mountains, 
skipping upon the hills. 

9My beloved is like a gazelle or a 
young hart; 

Behold, he standeth behind our wall, 

He looketh in through the windows, 

He peereth through the lattice. 

10My beloved spoke, and said unto 
me: 

‘Rise up, my love, my fair one, and 
come away. 

11For, lo, the winter is past, 

The rain is over and gone; 

12The flowers appear on the earth; 

The time of singing is come, 

And the voice of the turtle is heard 
in our land; 

13The fig-tree putteth forth her green 
figs, 

And the vines in blossom give forth 
their fragrance. 

Arise, my love, my fair one, and 
come away. 

14O my dove, that art in the clefts of 
the rock, in the covert of the cliff, 

Let me see thy countenance, let me 
hear thy voice; 

For sweet is thy voice, and thy 
countenance is comely.’ 

15’Take us the foxes, the little foxes, 
that spoil the vineyards; 

For our vineyards are in blossom.’ 

16My beloved is mine, and I am his, 

That feedeth among the lilies. 

17Until the day breathe, and the 
shadows flee away, 

Turn, my beloved, and be thou like 
a gazelle or a young hart 

Upon the mountains of spices. 

 

By night on my bed I sought him 
whom my soul loveth; 

I sought him, but I found him not. 

2’I will rise now, and go about the 
city, 


In the streets and in the broad ways, 

I will seek him whom my soul 
loveth.’ 

I sought him, but I found him not. 

3The watchmen that go about the 
city found me: 

‘Saw ye him whom my soul 
loveth?’ 

4Scarce had I passed from them, 

When I found him whom my soul 
loveth: 

I held him, and would not let him 
go, 

Until I had brought him into my 
mother’s house, 

And into the chamber of her that 
conceived me. 

5’I adjure you, O daughters of 
Jerusalem, 

By the gazelles, and by the hinds of 
the field, 

That ye awaken not, nor stir up love, 

Until it please.’ 

 

6Who is this that cometh up out of 
the wilderness 

Like pillars of smoke, 

Perfumed with myrrh and 
frankincense, 

With all powders of the merchant? 

7Behold, it is the litter of Solomon; 

Threescore mighty men are about it, 

Of the mighty men of Israel. 

8They all handle the sword, 

And are expert in war; 

Every man hath his sword upon his 
thigh, 

Because of dread in the night. 

9King Solomon made himself a 
palanquin 

Of the wood of Lebanon. 

10He made the pillars thereof of 
silver, 

The top thereof of gold, 

The seat of it of purple, 

The inside thereof being inlaid with 
love, 

From the daughters of Jerusalem. 

11Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, 

And gaze upon king Solomon, 

Even upon the crown wherewith his 
mother hath crowned him in the 
day of his espousals, 

And in the day of the gladness of his 
heart. 

 

Behold, thou art fair, my love; 
behold, thou art fair; 

Thine eyes are as doves behind thy 
veil; 

Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that 
trail down from mount Gilead. 

2Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes 
all shaped alike, 

Which are come up from the 
washing; 

Whereof all are paired, and none 
faileth among them. 

3Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, 

And thy mouth is comely; 

Thy temples are like a pomegranate 
split open 

Behind thy veil. 

4Thy neck is like the tower of David 

Builded with turrets, 

Whereon there hang a thousand 
shields, 
4 




All the armour of the mighty men. 

5Thy two breasts are like two fawns 

That are twins of a gazelle, 

Which feed among the lilies. 

6Until the day breathe, 

And the shadows flee away, 

I will get me to the mountain of 
myrrh, 

And to the hill of frankincense. 

7Thou art all fair, my love; 

And there is no spot in thee. 

8Come with me from Lebanon, my 
bride, 

With me from Lebanon; 

Look from the top of Amana, 

From the top of Senir and Hermon, 

From the lions’dens, 

From the mountains of the leopards. 

9Thou hast ravished my heart, my 
sister, my bride; 

Thou hast ravished my heart with 
one of thine eyes, 

With one bead of thy necklace. 

10How fair is thy love, my sister, my 
bride! 

How much better is thy love than 
wine! 

And the smell of thine ointments 
than all manner of spices! 

11Thy lips, O my bride, drop 
honey— 

Honey and milk are under thy 
tongue; 

And the smell of thy garments is 
like the smell of Lebanon. 

12A garden shut up is my sister, my 
bride; 

A spring shut up, a fountain sealed. 

13Thy shoots are a park of 
pomegranates, 

With precious fruits; 

Henna with spikenard plants, 

14Spikenard and saffron, calamus 
and cinnamon, 

With all trees of frankincense; 

Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief 
spices. 

15Thou art a fountain of gardens, 

A well of living waters, 

And flowing streams from Lebanon. 

 

16Awake, O north wind; 

And come, thou south; 

Blow upon my garden, 

That the spices thereof may flow 
out. 

Let my beloved come into his 
garden, 

And eat his precious fruits. 

 

I am come into my garden, my 
sister, my bride; 

I have gathered my myrrh with my 
spice; 

I have eaten my honeycomb with 
my honey; 

I have drunk my wine with my milk. 

Eat, O friends; 

Drink, yea, drink abundantly, O 
beloved. 

 

2I sleep, but my heart waketh; 

Hark! my beloved knocketh: 

‘Open to me, my sister, my love, my 
dove, my undefiled; 

For my head is filled with dew, 
5 




My locks with the drops of the 
night.’ 

3I have put off my coat; 

How shall I put it on? 

I have washed my feet; 

How shall I defile them? 

4My beloved put in his hand by the 
hole of the door, 

And my heart was moved for him. 

5I rose up to open to my beloved; 

And my hands dropped with myrrh, 

And my fingers with flowing myrrh, 

Upon the handles of the bar. 

6I opened to my beloved; 

But my beloved had turned away, 
and was gone. 

My soul failed me when he spoke. 

I sought him, but I could not find 
him; 

I called him, but he gave me no 
answer. 

7The watchmen that go about the 
city found me, 

They smote me, they wounded me; 

The keepers of the walls took away 
my mantle from me. 

8’I adjure you, O daughters of 
Jerusalem, 

If ye find my beloved, what will ye 
tell him? 

That I am love-sick.’ 

9’What is thy beloved more than 
another beloved, 

O thou fairest among women? 

What is thy beloved more than 
another beloved, 

That thou dost so adjure us?’ 

10’My beloved is white and ruddy, 

Pre-eminent above ten thousand. 

11His head is as the most fine gold, 

His locks are curled, 

And black as a raven. 

12His eyes are like doves 

Beside the water-brooks; 

Washed with milk, 

And fitly set. 

13His cheeks are as a bed of spices, 

As banks of sweet herbs; 

His lips are as lilies, 

Dropping with flowing myrrh. 

14His hands are as rods of gold 

Set with beryl; 

His body is as polished ivory 

Overlaid with sapphires. 

15His legs are as pillars of marble, 

Set upon sockets of fine gold; 

His aspect is like Lebanon, 

Excellent as the cedars. 

16His mouth is most sweet; 

Yea, he is altogether lovely. 

This is my beloved, and this is my 
friend, 

O daughters of Jerusalem.’ 

 

’Whither is thy beloved gone, 

O thou fairest among women? 

Whither hath thy beloved turned 
him, 

That we may seek him with thee?’ 

2’My beloved is gone down into his 
garden, 

To the beds of spices, 

To feed in the gardens, 

And to gather lilies. 

3I am my beloved’s, and my beloved 
is mine, 

That feedeth among the lilies.’ 

 
6 




4Thou art beautiful, O my love, as 
Tirzah, 

Comely as Jerusalem, 

Terrible as an army with banners. 

5Turn away thine eyes from me, 

For they have overcome me. 

Thy hair is as a flock of goats, 

That trail down from Gilead. 

6Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, 

Which are come up from the 
washing; 

Whereof all are paired, 

And none faileth among them. 

7Thy temples are like a pomegranate 
split open 

Behind thy veil. 

8There are threescore queens, 

And fourscore concubines, 

And maidens without number. 

9My dove, my undefiled, is but one; 

She is the only one of her mother; 

She is the choice one of her that 
bore her. 

The daughters saw her, and called 
her happy; 

Yea, the queens and the concubines, 
and they praised her. 

10Who is she that looketh forth as 
the dawn, 

Fair as the moon, 

Clear as the sun, 

Terrible as an army with banners? 

11I went down into the garden of 
nuts, 

To look at the green plants of the 
valley, 

To see whether the vine budded, 

And the pomegranates were in 
flower. 

12Before I was aware, my soul set 
me 

Upon the chariots of my princely 
people. 

 

Return, return, O Shulammite; 

Return, return, that we may look 
upon thee. 

What will ye see in the Shulammite? 

As it were a dance of two 
companies. 

 

2How beautiful are thy steps in 
sandals, 

O prince’s daughter! 

The roundings of thy thighs are like 
the links of a chain, 

The work of the hands of a skilled 
workman. 

3Thy navel is like a round goblet, 

Wherein no mingled wine is 
wanting; 

Thy belly is like a heap of wheat 

Set about with lilies. 

4Thy two breasts are like two fawns 

That are twins of a gazelle. 

5Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; 

Thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, 

By the gate of Bath-rabbim; 

Thy nose is like the tower of 
Lebanon 

Which looketh toward Damascus. 

6Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, 

And the hair of thy head like purple; 

The king is held captive in the 
tresses thereof. 

7How fair and how pleasant art thou, 

O love, for delights! 
7 




8This thy stature is like to a palm-
tree, 

And thy breasts to clusters of 
grapes. 

9I said: ‘I will climb up into the 
palm-tree, 

I will take hold of the branches 
thereof; 

And let thy breasts be as clusters of 
the vine, 

And the smell of thy countenance 
like apples; 

10And the roof of thy mouth like the 
best wine, 

That glideth down smoothly for my 
beloved, 

Moving gently the lips of those that 
are asleep.’ 

 

11I am my beloved’s, 

And his desire is toward me. : 

12Come, my beloved, let us go forth 
into the field; 

Let us lodge in the villages. 

13Let us get up early to the 
vineyards; 

Let us see whether the vine hath 
budded, 

Whether the vine-blossom be 
opened, 

And the pomegranates be in flower; 

There will I give thee my love. 

14The mandrakes give forth 
fragrance, 

And at our doors are all manner of 
precious fruits, 

New and old, 

Which I have laid up for thee, O my 
beloved. 

 

Oh that thou wert as my brother, 

That sucked the breasts of my 
mother! 

When I should find thee without, I 
would kiss thee; 

Yea, and none would despise me. 

2I would lead thee, and bring thee 
into my mother’s house, 

That thou mightest instruct me; 

I would cause thee to drink of 
spiced wine, 

Of the juice of my pomegranate. 

3His left hand should be under my 
head, 

And his right hand should embrace 
me. 

4’I adjure you, O daughters of 
Jerusalem: 

Why should ye awaken, or stir up 
love, 

Until it please?’ 

 

5Who is this that cometh up from 
the wilderness, 

Leaning upon her beloved? 

Under the apple-tree I awakened 
thee; 

There thy mother was in travail with 
thee; 

There was she in travail and brought 
thee forth. 

 

6Set me as a seal upon thy heart, 

As a seal upon thine arm; 

For love is strong as death, 

Jealousy is cruel as the grave; 

The flashes thereof are flashes of 
fire, 
8 




A very flame of the LORD. 

7Many waters cannot quench love, 

Neither can the floods drown it; 

If a man would give all the 
substance of his house for love, 

He would utterly be contemned. 

8We have a little sister, 

And she hath no breasts; 

What shall we do for our sister 

In the day when she shall be spoken 
for? 

9If she be a wall, 

We will build upon her a turret of 
silver; 

And if she be a door, 

We will enclose her with boards of 
cedar. 

 

10I am a wall, 

And my breasts like the towers 
thereof; 

Then was I in his eyes 

As one that found peace. 

 

11Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-
hamon; 

He gave over the vineyard unto 
keepers; 

Every one for the fruit thereof 

Brought in a thousand pieces of 
silver. 

12My vineyard, which is mine, is 
before me; 

Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the 
thousand, 

And those that keep the fruit thereof 
two hundred. 

 

13Thou that dwellest in the gardens, 

The companions hearken for thy 
voice: 

‘Cause me to hear it.’ 

 

14Make haste, my beloved, 

And be thou like to a gazelle or to a 
young hart 

Upon the mountains of spices.
