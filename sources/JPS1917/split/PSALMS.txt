HAPPY IS the man that hath not 
walked in the counsel of the 
wicked, 

Nor stood in the way of sinners, 

Nor sat in the seat of the scornful. 

2But his delight is in the law of the 
LORD; 

And in His law doth he meditate day 
and night. 

3And he shall be like a tree planted 
by streams of water, 

That bringeth forth its fruit in its 
season, 

And whose leaf doth not wither; 

And in whatsoever he doeth he shall 
prosper. 

 

4Not so the wicked; 

But they are like the chaff which the 
wind driveth away. 

5Therefore the wicked shall not 
stand in the judgment, 

Nor sinners in the congregation of 
the righteous. 

6For the LORD regardeth the way of 
the righteous; 

But the way of the wicked shall 
perish. 

 

 

Why are the nations in an 
uproar? 

And why do the peoples mutter in 
vain? 

2 The kings of the earth stand up, 

And the rulers take counsel together, 

Against the LORD, and against His 
anointed: 

3 'Let us break their bands asunder, 

And cast away their cords from us.' 

 

4 He that sitteth in heaven laugheth, 

The Lord hath them in derision. 

5 Then will He speak unto them in 
His wrath, 

And affright them in His sore 
displeasure: 

6 'Truly it is I that have established 
My king 

Upon Zion, My holy mountain.' 

 

7 I will tell of the decree: 

The LORD said unto me: 'Thou art 
My son, 

This day have I begotten thee. 

8 Ask of Me, and I will give the 
nations for thine inheritance, 

And the ends of the earth for thy 
possession. 

9 Thou shalt break them with a rod 
of iron; 

Thou shalt dash them in pieces like 
a potter's vessel.'

2 




 

10 Now therefore, O ye kings, be 
wise; 

Be admonished, ye judges of the 
earth. 

11Serve the LORD with fear, 

And rejoice with trembling. 

12Do homage in purity, lest He be 
angry, and ye perish in the way, 

When suddenly His wrath is 
kindled. 

 

Happy are all they that take refuge 
in Him. 

 

A Psalm of David, when he fled 
from Absalom his son. 

 

2LORD, how many are mine 
adversaries become! 

Many are they that rise up against 
me. 

3Many there are that say of my soul: 

'There is no salvation for him in 
God.' Selah 

 

4But thou, O LORD, art a shield about 
me; 

My glory, and the lifter up of my 
head. 

5With my voice I call unto the LORD, 

And He answereth me out of His 
holy mountain. Selah 

 

6I lay me down, and I sleep; 

I awake, for the LORD sustaineth me. 

7I am not afraid of ten thousands of 
people, 

That have set themselves against me 
round about. 

 

8Arise, O LORD; save me, O my 
God; 

For Thou hast smitten all mine 
enemies upon the cheek, 

Thou hast broken the teeth of the 
wicked. 

 

9Salvation belongeth unto the LORD; 

Thy blessing be upon Thy people. 

Selah 

 

For the Leader; with string-music. 
A Psalm of David. 

 

2Answer me when I call, O God of 
my righteousness, 

Thou who didst set me free when I 
was in distress; 

Be gracious unto me, and hear my 
prayer. 

3O ye sons of men, how long shall 
my glory be put to shame, 

In that ye love vanity, and seek after 
falsehood? Selah 

4But know that the LORD hath set 
apart the godly man as His own; 

The LORD will hear when I call unto 
Him. 

 

5Tremble, and sin not; 

Commune with your own heart 
upon your bed, and be still. Selah 

6Offer the sacrifices of 
righteousness, 

And put your trust in the LORD. 

 
3 

4 




7Many there are that say: 'Oh that 
we could see some good!' 

LORD, lift Thou up the light of Thy 
countenance upon us. 

8Thou hast put gladness in my heart, 

More than when their corn and their 
wine increase. 

9In peace will I both lay me down 
and sleep; 

For Thou, LORD, makest me dwell 
alone in safety. 

 

For the Leader; upon the 
Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. 

 

2Give ear to my words, O LORD, 
consider my meditation. 

3Hearken unto the voice of my cry, 
my King, and my God; 

For unto Thee do I pray. 

 

4O LORD, in the morning shalt Thou 
hear my voice; 

In the morning will I order my 
prayer unto Thee, and will look 
forward. 

5For Thou art not a God that hath 
pleasure in wickedness; 

Evil shall not sojourn with Thee. 

6The boasters shall not stand in Thy 
sight; 

Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 

7Thou destroyest them that speak 
falsehood; 

The LORD abhorreth the man of 
blood and of deceit. 

8But as for me, in the abundance of 
Thy lovingkindness will I come 
into Thy house; 

I will bow down toward Thy holy 
temple in the fear of Thee. 

 

9O LORD, lead me in Thy 
righteousness because of them 
that lie in wait for me; 

Make Thy way straight before my 
face. 

10For there is no sincerity in their 
mouth; 

Their inward part is a yawning gulf, 

Their throat is an open sepulchre; 

They make smooth their tongue. 

11Hold them guilty, O God, 

Let them fall by their own counsels; 

Cast them down in the multitude of 
their transgressions; 

For they have rebelled against Thee. 

 

12So shall all those that take refuge 
in Thee rejoice, 

They shall ever shout for joy, 

And Thou shalt shelter them; 

Let them also that love Thy name 
exult in Thee. 

13For Thou dost bless the righteous; 

O LORD, Thou dost encompass him 
with favour as with a shield. 

 

For the Leader; with string-music; 
on the Sheminith. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

2O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine 
anger, 

Neither chasten me in Thy wrath. 

3Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I 
languish away; 
5 

6 




Heal me, O LORD, for my bones are 
affrighted. 

4My soul also is sore affrighted; 

And Thou, O LORD, how long? 

 

5Return, O LORD, deliver my soul; 

Save me for Thy mercy's sake. 

6For in death there is no 
remembrance of Thee; 

In the nether-world who will give 
Thee thanks? 

7I am weary with my groaning; 

Every night make I my bed to swim; 

I melt away my couch with my 
tears. 

8Mine eye is dimmed because of 
vexation; 

It waxeth old because of all mine 
adversaries. 

 

9Depart from me, all ye workers of 
iniquity; 

For the LORD hath heard the voice of 
my weeping. 

10The LORD hath heard my 
supplication; 

The LORD receiveth my prayer. 

11All mine enemies shall be 
ashamed and sore affrighted; 

They shall turn back, they shall be 
ashamed suddenly. 

 

Shiggaion of David, which he 
sang unto the LORD, concerning 
Cush a Benjamite. 

 

2O LORD my God, in Thee have I 
taken refuge; 

Save me from all them that pursue 
me, and deliver me; 

3Lest he tear my soul like a lion, 

Rending it in pieces, while there is 
none to deliver. 

 

4O LORD my God, if I have done 
this; 

If there be iniquity in my hands; 

5If I have requited him that did evil 
unto me, 

Or spoiled mine adversary unto 
emptiness; 

6Let the enemy pursue my soul, and 
overtake it, 

And tread my life down to the earth; 

Yea, let him lay my glory in the 
dust. Selah 

 

7Arise, O LORD, in Thine anger, 

Lift up Thyself in indignation 
against mine adversaries; 

Yea, awake for me at the judgment 
which Thou hast commanded. 

8And let the congregation of the 
peoples compass Thee about, 

And over them return Thou on high. 

 

9O LORD, who ministerest judgment 
to the peoples, 

Judge me, O LORD, 

According to my righteousness, and 
according to mine integrity that is 
in me. 

10Oh that a full measure of evil 
might come upon the wicked, 

And that Thou wouldest establish 
the righteous; 
7 




For the righteous God trieth the 
heart and reins. 

11My shield is with God, 

Who saveth the upright in heart. 

12God is a righteous judge, 

Yea, a God that hath indignation 
every day: 

13If a man turn not, He will whet His 
sword, 

He hath bent His bow, and made it 
ready; 

14He hath also prepared for him the 
weapons of death, 

Yea, His arrows which He made 
sharp. 

15Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; 

Yea, he conceiveth mischief, and 
bringeth forth falsehood. 

16He hath digged a pit, and hollowed 
it, 

And is fallen into the ditch which he 
made. 

17His mischief shall return upon his 
own head, 

And his violence shall come down 
upon his own pate. 

 

18I will give thanks unto the LORD 
according to His righteousness; 

And will sing praise to the name of 
the LORD Most High. 

 

For the Leader; upon the Gittith. 
A Psalm of David. 

 

2O LORD, our Lord, 

How glorious is Thy name in all the 
earth! 

Whose majesty is rehearsed above 
the heavens. 

3Out of the mouth of babes and 
sucklings hast Thou founded 
strength, 

Because of Thine adversaries; 

That Thou mightest still the enemy 
and the avenger. 

 

4When I behold Thy heavens, the 
work of Thy fingers, 

The moon and the stars, which Thou 
hast established; 

5What is man, that Thou art mindful 
of him? 

And the son of man, that Thou 
thinkest of him? 

6Yet Thou hast made him but little 
lower than the angels, 

And hast crowned him with glory 
and honour. 

7Thou hast made him to have 
dominion over the works of Thy 
hands; 

Thou hast put all things under His 
feet: 

8Sheep and oxen, all of them, 

Yea, and the beasts of the field; 

9The fowl of the air, and the fish of 
the sea; 

Whatsoever passeth through the 
paths of the seas. 

 

10O LORD, our Lord, 

How glorious is Thy name in all the 
earth! 

 

For the Leader; upon Muthlabben. 
A Psalm of David. 
8 

9 




 

2I will give thanks unto the LORD 
with my whole heart; 

I will tell of all Thy marvellous 
works. 

3I will be glad and exult in Thee; 

I will sing praise to Thy name, O 
Most High: 

 

4When mine enemies are turned 
back, 

They stumble and perish at Thy 
presence; 

5For Thou hast maintained my right 
and my cause; 

Thou sattest upon the throne as the 
righteous Judge. 

 

6Thou hast rebuked the nations, 

Thou hast destroyed the wicked, 

Thou hast blotted out their name for 
ever and ever. 

7O thou enemy, the waste places are 
come to an end for ever; 

And the cities which thou didst 
uproot, 

Their very memorial is perished. 

 

8But the LORD is enthroned for ever; 

He hath established His throne for 
judgment. 

9And He will judge the world in 
righteousness, 

He will minister judgment to the 
peoples with equity. 

 

10The LORD also will be a high tower 
for the oppressed, 

A high tower in times of trouble; 

11And they that know Thy name will 
put their trust in Thee; 

For thou, LORD, hast not forsaken 
them that seek Thee. 

 

12Sing praises to the LORD, who 
dwelleth in Zion; 

Declare among the peoples His 
doings. 

13For He that avengeth blood hath 
remembered them; 

He hath not forgotten the cry of the 
humble. 

 

14Be gracious unto me, O LORD, 

Behold mine affliction at the hands 
of them that hate me; 

Thou that liftest me up from the 
gates of death; 

15That I may tell of all Thy praise in 
the gates of the daughter of Zion, 

That I may rejoice in Thy salvation. 

 

16The nations are sunk down in the 
pit that they made; 

In the net which they hid is their 
own foot taken. 

17The LORD hath made Himself 
known, He hath executed 
judgment, 

The wicked is snared in the work of 
his own hands. Higgaion. Selah 

 

18The wicked shall return to the 
nether-world, 

Even all the nations that forget God. 

19For the needy shall not alway be 
forgotten, 


Nor the expectation of the poor 
perish for ever. 

20Arise, O LORD, let not man prevail; 

Let the nations be judged in Thy 
sight. 

21Set terror over them, O LORD; 

Let the nations know they are but 
men. Selah 

 

Why standest Thou afar off, 
O LORD? 

Why hidest Thou Thyself in times 
of trouble? 

2Through the pride of the wicked the 
poor is hotly pursued, 

They are taken in the devices that 
they have imagined. 

 

3For the wicked boasteth of his 
heart's desire, 

And the covetous vaunteth himself, 
though he contemn the LORD. 

4The wicked, in the pride of his 
countenance [, saith]: 'He will not 
require'; 

All his thoughts are: 'There is no 
God.' 

5His ways prosper at all times; 

Thy judgments are far above out of 
his sight; 

As for all his adversaries, he puffeth 
at them. 

6He saith in his heart: 'I shall not be 
moved, 

I who to all generations shall not be 
in adversity.' 

7His mouth is full of cursing and 
deceit and oppression; 

Under his tongue is mischief and 
iniquity. 

8He sitteth in the lurking-places of 
the villages; 

In secret places doth he slay the 
innocent; 

His eyes are on the watch for the 
helpless. 

9He lieth in wait in a secret place as 
a lion in his lair, 

He lieth in wait to catch the poor; 

He doth catch the poor, when he 
draweth him up in his net. 

10He croucheth, he boweth down, 

And the helpless fall into his mighty 
claws. 

11He hath said in his heart: 'God 
hath forgotten; 

He hideth His face; He will never 
see.' 

 

12Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Thy 
hand; 

Forget not the humble. 

13Wherefore doth the wicked 
contemn God, 

And say in his heart: 'Thou wilt not 
require'? 

14Thou hast seen; for Thou 
beholdest trouble and vexation, to 
requite them with Thy hand; 

Unto Thee the helpless committeth 
himself; 

Thou hast been the helper of the 
fatherless. 

 

15Break Thou the arm of the wicked; 
10 




And as for the evil man, search out 
his wickedness, till none be 
found. 

16The LORD is King for ever and 
ever; 

The nations are perished out of His 
land. 

 

17LORD, Thou hast heard the desire 
of the humble: 

Thou wilt direct their heart, Thou 
wilt cause Thine ear to attend; 

18To right the fatherless and the 
oppressed, 

That man who is of the earth may be 
terrible no more. 

 

For the Leader. [A Psalm] of 
David. 

 

In the LORD have I taken refuge; 

How say ye to my soul: 

'Flee thou! to your mountain, ye 
birds'? 

 

2For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, 

They have made ready their arrow 
upon the string, 

That they may shoot in darkness at 
the upright in heart. 

3When the foundations are 
destroyed, 

What hath the righteous wrought? 

 

4The LORD is in His holy temple, 

The LORD, His throne is in heaven; 

His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the 
children of men. 

5The LORD trieth the righteous; 

But the wicked and him that loveth 
violence His soul hateth. 

6Upon the wicked He will cause to 
rain coals; 

Fire and brimstone and burning 
wind shall be the portion of their 
cup. 

 

7For the LORD is righteous, He 
loveth righteousness; 

The upright shall behold His face. 

 

For the Leader; on the 
Sheminith. A Psalm of David. 

 

2Help, LORD; for the godly man 
ceaseth; 

For the faithful fail from among the 
children of men. 

3They speak falsehood every one 
with his neighbour; 

With flattering lip, and with a 
double heart, do they speak. 

 

4May the LORD cut off all flattering 
lips, 

The tongue that speaketh proud 
things! 

5Who have said: 'Our tongue will we 
make mighty; 

Our lips are with us: who is lord 
over us?' 

 

6'For the oppression of the poor, for 
the sighing of the needy, 

Now will I arise', saith the LORD; 

'I will set him in safety at whom 
they puff.' 

 
11 

12 




7The words of the LORD are pure 
words, 

As silver tried in a crucible on the 
earth, refined seven times. 

 

8Thou wilt keep them, O LORD; 

Thou wilt preserve us from this 
generation for ever. 

9The wicked walk on every side, 

When vileness is exalted among the 
sons of men. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

2How long, O LORD, wilt Thou 
forget me for ever? 

How long wilt Thou hide Thy face 
from me? 

3How long shall I take counsel in 
my soul, having sorrow in my 
heart by day? 

How long shall mine enemy be 
exalted over me? 

4Behold Thou, and answer me, O 
LORD my God; 

Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the 
sleep of death; 

5Lest mine enemy say: 'I have 
prevailed against him'; 

Lest mine adversaries rejoice when I 
am moved. 

 

6But as for me, in Thy mercy do I 
trust; 

My heart shall rejoice in Thy 
salvation. 

7I will sing unto the LORD, 

Because He hath dealt bountifully 
with me. 

 

For the Leader. [A Psalm] of 
David. 

 

The fool hath said in his heart: 
'There is no God'; 

They have dealt corruptly, they have 
done abominably; 

There is none that doeth good. 

2The LORD looked forth from heaven 
upon the children of men, 

To see if there were any man of 
understanding, that did seek after 
God. 

3They are all corrupt, they are 
together become impure; 

There is none that doeth good, no, 
not one. 

 

4’Shall not all the workers of 
iniquity know it, 

Who eat up My people as they eat 
bread, 

And call not upon the LORD?' 

5There are they in great fear; 

For God is with the righteous 
generation. 

6Ye would put to shame the counsel 
of the poor, 

But the LORD is his refuge. 

7Oh that the salvation of Israel were 
come out of Zion! 

When the LORD turneth the captivity 
of His people, 

Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. 

 
13 

14 




A Psalm of David. 

 

LORD, who shall sojourn in Thy 
tabernacle? 

Who shall dwell upon Thy holy 
mountain? 

2He that walketh uprightly, and 
worketh righteousness, 

And speaketh truth in his heart; 

3That hath no slander upon his 
tongue, 

Nor doeth evil to his fellow, 

Nor taketh up a reproach against his 
neighbour; 

4In whose eyes a vile person is 
despised, 

But he honoureth them that fear the 
LORD; 

He that sweareth to his own hurt, 
and changeth not; 

5He that putteth not out his money 
on interest, 

Nor taketh a bribe against the 
innocent. 

He that doeth these things shall 
never be moved. 

 

Michtam of David. 

 

Keep me, O God; for I have taken 
refuge in Thee. 

2I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art 
my Lord; 

I have no good but in Thee'; 

3As for the holy that are in the earth, 

They are the excellent in whom is 
all my delight. 

4Let the idols of them be multiplied 
that make suit unto another; 

Their drink-offerings of blood will I 
not offer, 

Nor take their names upon my lips. 

5O LORD, the portion of mine 
inheritance and of my cup, 

Thou maintainest my lot. 

 

6The lines are fallen unto me in 
pleasant places; 

Yea, I have a goodly heritage. 

7I will bless the LORD, who hath 
given me counsel; 

Yea, in the night seasons my reins 
instruct me. 

8I have set the LORD always before 
me; 

Surely He is at my right hand, I 
shall not be moved. 

9Therefore my heart is glad, and my 
glory rejoiceth; my flesh also 
dwelleth in safety; 

10For Thou wilt not abandon my 
soul to the nether-world; 

Neither wilt Thou suffer Thy godly 
one to see the pit. 

11Thou makest me to know the path 
of life; 

In Thy presence is fulness of joy, 

In Thy right hand bliss for 
evermore. 

 

A Prayer of David. 

 

Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto 
my cry; 

Give ear unto my prayer from lips 
without deceit. 

2Let my judgment come forth from 
Thy presence; 
15 

16 

17 




Let Thine eyes behold equity. 

3Thou hast tried my heart, Thou hast 
visited it in the night; 

Thou hast tested me, and Thou 
findest not 

That I had a thought which should 
not pass my mouth. 

4As for the doings of men, by the 
word of Thy lips 

I have kept me from the ways of the 
violent. 

5My steps have held fast to Thy 
paths, 

My feet have not slipped. 

 

6As for me, I call upon Thee, for 
Thou wilt answer me, O God; 

Incline Thine ear unto me, hear my 
speech. 

7Make passing great Thy mercies, O 
Thou that savest by Thy right 
hand 

From assailants them that take 
refuge in Thee. 

8Keep me as the apple of the eye, 

Hide me in the shadow of Thy 
wings, 

9From the wicked that oppress, 

My deadly enemies, that compass 
me about. 

10Their gross heart they have shut 
tight, 

With their mouth they speak 
proudly. 

11At our every step they have now 
encompassed us; 

They set their eyes to cast us down 
to the earth. 

12He is like a lion that is eager to 
tear in pieces, 

And like a young lion lurking in 
secret places. 

 

13Arise, O LORD, confront him, cast 
him down; 

Deliver my soul from the wicked, 
by Thy sword; 

14From men, by Thy hand, O LORD, 

From men of the world, whose 
portion is in this life, 

And whose belly Thou fillest with 
Thy treasure; 

Who have children in plenty, 

And leave their abundance to their 
babes. 

15As for me, I shall behold Thy face 
in righteousness; 

I shall be satisfied, when I awake, 
with Thy likeness. 

 

For the Leader. [A Psalm] of 
David the servant of the LORD, 
who spoke unto the LORD the words of 
this song in the day that the LORD 
delivered him from the hand of all his 
enemies, and from the hand of Saul; 
2And he said: 

I love thee, O LORD, my strength. 

3The LORD is my rock, and my 
fortress, and my deliverer; 

My God, my rock, in Him I take 
refuge; 

My shield, and my horn of 
salvation, my high tower. 

4Praised, I cry, is the LORD, 

And I am saved from mine enemies. 

 
18 




5The cords of Death compassed me, 

And the floods of aBelial assailed 
me. 

a That is, the nether-world. 

6The cords of aSheol surrounded me; 

The snares of Death confronted me. 

7In my distress I called upon the 
LORD, 

And cried unto my God; 

Out of His temple He heard my 
voice, 

And my cry came before Him unto 
His ears. 

 

8Then the earth did shake and 
quake, 

The foundations also of the 
mountains did tremble; 

They were shaken, because He was 
wroth. 

9Smoke arose up in His nostrils, 

And fire out of His mouth did 
devour; 

Coals flamed forth from Him. 

10He bowed the heavens also, and 
came down; 

And thick darkness was under His 
feet. 

11And He rode upon a cherub, and 
did fly; 

Yea, He did swoop down upon the 
wings of the wind. 

12He made darkness His hiding-
place, His pavilion round about 
Him; 

Darkness of waters, thick clouds of 
the skies. 

13At the brightness before Him, 
there passed through His thick 
clouds 

Hailstones and coals of fire. 

14The LORD also thundered in the 
heavens, 

And the Most High gave forth His 
voice; 

Hailstones and coals of fire. 

15And He sent out His arrows, and 
scattered them; 

And He shot forth lightnings, and 
discomfited them. 

16And the channels of waters 
appeared, 

And the foundations of the world 
were laid bare, 

At Thy rebuke, O LORD, 

At the blast of the breath of Thy 
nostrils. 

 

17He sent from on high, He took me; 

He drew me out of many waters. 

18He delivered me from mine enemy 

 most strong, 

And from them that hated me, for 
they were too mighty for me. 

19They confronted me in the day of 
my calamity; 

But the LORD was a stay unto me. 

20He brought me forth also into a 
large place; 

He delivered me, because He 
delighted in me. 

21The LORD rewarded me according 
to my righteousness; 

According to the cleanness of my 
hands hath He recompensed me. 

 


22For I have kept the ways of the 
LORD, 

And have not wickedly departed 
from my God. 

23For all His ordinances were before 
me, 

And I put not away His statutes 
from me. 

24And I was single-hearted with 
Him, 

And I kept myself from mine 
iniquity. 

25Therefore hath the LORD 
recompensed me according to my 
righteousness, 

According to the cleanness of my 
hands in His eyes. 

26With the merciful Thou dost show 
Thyself merciful, 

With the upright man Thou dost 
show Thyself upright; 

27With the pure Thou dost show 
Thyself pure; 

And with the crooked Thou dost 
show Thyself subtle. 

28For Thou dost save the afflicted 
people; 

But the haughty eyes Thou dost 
humble. 

 

29For Thou dost light my lamp; 

The LORD my God doth lighten my 
darkness. 

30For by Thee I run upon a troop; 

And by my God do I scale a wall. 

31As for God, His way is perfect; 

The word of the LORD is tried; 

He is a shield unto all them that take 
refuge in Him. 

 

32For who is God, save the LORD? 

And who is a Rock, except our 
God? 

33The God that girdeth me with 
strength, 

And maketh my way straight; 

34Who maketh my feet like hinds', 

And setteth me upon my high 
places; 

35Who traineth my hands for war, 

So that mine arms do bend a bow of 
brass. 

36Thou hast also given me Thy 
shield of salvation, 

And Thy right hand hath holden me 
up; 

And Thy condescension hath made 
me great. 

37Thou hast enlarged my steps under 
me, 

And my feet have not slipped. 

 

38I have pursued mine enemies, and 
overtaken them; 

Neither did I turn back till they were 
consumed. 

39I have smitten them through, so 
that they are not able to rise; 

They are fallen under my feet. 

40For Thou hast girded me with 
strength unto the battle; 

Thou hast subdued under me those 
that rose up against me. 

41Thou hast also made mine enemies 
turn their backs unto me, 

And I did cut off them that hate me. 

42They cried, but there was none to 
save; 


Even unto the LORD, but He 
answered them not. 

43Then did I beat them small as the 
dust before the wind; 

I did cast them out as the mire of the 
streets. 

44Thou hast delivered me from the 
contentions of the people; 

Thou hast made me the head of the 
nations; 

A people whom I have not known 
serve me. 

45As soon as they hear of me, they 
obey me; 

The sons of the stranger dwindle 
away before me. 

46The sons of the stranger fade 
away, 

And come trembling out of their 
close places. 

 

47The LORD liveth, and blessed be 
my Rock; 

And exalted be the God of my 
salvation; 

48Even the God that executeth 
vengeance for me, 

And subdueth peoples under me. 

49He delivereth me from mine 
enemies; 

Yea, Thou liftest me up above them 
that rise up against me; 

Thou deliverest me from the violent 
man. 

50Therefore I will give thanks unto 
Thee, O LORD, among the nations, 

And will sing praises unto Thy 
name. 

51Great salvation giveth He to His 
king; 

And showeth mercy to His anointed, 

To David and to his seed, for 
evermore. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

2The heavens declare the glory of 
God, 

And the firmament showeth His 
handiwork; 

3Day unto day uttereth speech, 

And night unto night revealeth 
knowledge; 

4There is no speech, there are no 
words, 

Neither is their voice heard. 

5Their line is gone out through all 
the earth, 

And their words to the end of the 
world. 

In them hath He set a tent for the 
sun, 

6Which is as a bridegroom coming 
out of his chamber, 

And rejoiceth as a strong man to run 
his course. 

7His going forth is from the end of 
the heaven, 

And his circuit unto the ends of it; 

And there is nothing hid from the 
heat thereof. 

 

8The law of the LORD is perfect, 
restoring the soul; 

The testimony of the LORD is sure, 
making wise the simple. 
19 




9The precepts of the LORD are right, 
rejoicing the heart; 

The commandment of the LORD is 
pure, enlightening the eyes. 

10The fear of the LORD is clean, 
enduring for ever; 

The ordinances of the LORD are true, 
they are righteous altogether; 

11More to be desired are they than 
gold, yea, than much fine gold; 

Sweeter also than honey and the 
honeycomb. 

12Moreover by them is Thy servant 
warned; 

In keeping of them there is great 
reward. 

13Who can discern his errors? 

Clear Thou me from hidden faults. 

14Keep back Thy servant also from 
presumptuous sins, 

That they may not have dominion 
over me; then shall I be faultless, 

And I shall be clear from great 
transgression. 

15Let the words of my mouth and the 
meditation of my heart be 
acceptable before Thee, 

O LORD, my Rock, and my 
Redeemer. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

2The LORD answer thee in the day of 
trouble; 

The name of the God of Jacob set 
thee up on high; 

3Send forth thy help from the 
sanctuary, 

And support thee out of Zion; 

4Receive the memorial of all thy 
meal-offerings, 

And accept the fat of thy burnt-
sacrifice; Selah 

5Grant thee according to thine own 
heart, 

And fulfil all thy counsel. 

6We will shout for joy in thy 
victory, 

And in the name of our God we will 
set up our standards; 

The LORD fulfil all thy petitions. 

 

7Now know I that the LORD saveth 
His anointed; 

He will answer him from His holy 
heaven 

With the mighty acts of His saving 
right hand. 

8Some trust in chariots, and some in 
horses; 

But we will make mention of the 
name of the LORD our God. 

9They are bowed down and fallen; 

But we are risen, and stand upright. 

10Save, LORD; 

Let the King answer us in the day 
that we call. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

2O LORD, in Thy strength the king 
rejoiceth; 

And in Thy salvation how greatly 
doth he exult! 

3Thou hast given him his heart's 
desire, 
20 

21 




And the request of his lips Thou 
hast not withholden. Selah 

4For Thou meetest him with 
choicest blessings; 

Thou settest a crown of fine gold on 
his head. 

5He asked life of Thee, Thou gavest 
it him; 

Even length of days for ever and 
ever. 

6His glory is great through Thy 
salvation; 

Honour and majesty dost Thou lay 
upon him. 

7For Thou makest him most blessed 
for ever; 

Thou makest him glad with joy in 
Thy presence. 

8For the king trusteth in the LORD, 

Yea, in the mercy of the Most High; 
he shall not be moved. 

 

9Thy hand shall be equal to all thine 
enemies; 

Thy right hand shall overtake those 
that hate thee. 

10Thou shalt make them as a fiery 
furnace in the time of thine anger; 

The LORD shall swallow them up in 
His wrath, 

And the fire shall devour them. 

11Their fruit shalt thou destroy from 
the earth, 

And their seed from among the 
children of men. 

12For they intended evil against thee, 

They imagined a device, wherewith 
they shall not prevail. 

13For thou shalt make them turn 
their back, 

Thou shalt make ready with thy 
bowstrings against the face of 
them. 

 

14Be Thou exalted, O LORD, in Thy 
strength; 

So will we sing and praise Thy 
power. 

 

For the Leader; upon Aijeleth 
ha-Shahar. A Psalm of David. 

 

2My God, my God, why hast Thou 
forsaken me, 

And art far from my help at the 
words of my cry? 

3O my God, I call by day, but Thou 
answerest not; 

And at night, and there is no 
surcease for me. 

4Yet Thou art holy, 

O Thou that art enthroned upon the 
praises of Israel. 

5In Thee did our fathers trust; 

They trusted, and Thou didst deliver 
them. 

6Unto Thee they cried, and escaped; 

In Thee did they trust, and were not 
ashamed. 

7But I am a worm, and no man; 

A reproach of men, and despised of 
the people. 

8All they that see me laugh me to 
scorn; 

They shoot out the lip, they shake 
the head: 
22 




9'Let him commit himself unto the 
LORD! let Him rescue him; 

Let Him deliver him, seeing He 
delighteth in him.' 

 

10For Thou art He that took me out 
of the womb; 

Thou madest me trust when I was 
upon my mother's breasts. 

11Upon Thee I have been cast from 
my birth; 

Thou art my God from my mother's 
womb. 

12Be not far from me; for trouble is 
near; 

For there is none to help. 

13Many bulls have encompassed me; 

Strong bulls of Bashan have beset 
me round. 

14They open wide their mouth 
against me, 

As a ravening and a roaring lion. 

15I am poured out like water, 

And all my bones are out of joint; 

My heart is become like wax; 

It is melted in mine inmost parts. 

16My strength is dried up like a 
potsherd; 

And my tongue cleaveth to my 
throat; 

And Thou layest me in the dust of 
death. 

17For dogs have encompassed me; 

A company of evil-doers have 
inclosed me; 

Like a lion, they are at my hands 
and my feet. 

18I may count all my bones; 

They look and gloat over me. 

19They part my garments among 
them, 

And for my vesture do they cast 
lots. 

20But Thou, O LORD, be not far off; 

O Thou my strength, hasten to help 
me. 

21Deliver my soul from the sword; 

Mine only one from the power of 
the dog. 

22Save me from the lion's mouth; 

Yea, from the horns of the wild-
oxen do Thou answer me. 

 

23I will declare Thy name unto my 
brethren; 

In the midst of the congregation will 
I praise Thee. 

24'Ye that fear the LORD, praise Him; 

All ye the seed of Jacob, glorify 
Him; 

And stand in awe of Him, all ye the 
seed of Israel. 

25For He hath not despised nor 
abhorred the lowliness of the 
poor; 

Neither hath He hid His face from 
him; 

But when he cried unto Him, He 
heard.' 

26From Thee cometh my praise in 
the great congregation; 

I will pay my vows before them that 
fear Him. 

27Let the humble eat and be 
satisfied; 

Let them praise the LORD that seek 
after Him; 


May your heart be quickened for 
ever! 

28All the ends of the earth shall 
remember and turn unto the LORD; 

And all the kindreds of the nations 
shall worship before Thee. 

29For the kingdom is the LORD’S; 

And He is the ruler over the nations. 

30All the fat ones of the earth shall 
eat and worship; 

All they that go down to the dust 
shall kneel before Him, 

Even he that cannot keep his soul 
alive. 

31A seed shall serve him; 

It shall be told of the Lord unto the 
next generation. 

32They shall come and shall declare 
His righteousness 

Unto a people that shall be born, 
that He hath done it. 

 

A Psalm of David. 

 

The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not 
want. 

2He maketh me to lie down in green 
pastures; 

He leadeth me beside the still 
waters. 

3He restoreth my soul; 

He guideth me in straight paths for 
His name's sake. 

4Yea, though I walk through the 
valley of the shadow of death, 

I will fear no evil, for Thou art with 
me; 

Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort 
me. 

5Thou preparest a table before me in 
the presence of mine enemies; 

Thou hast anointed my head with 
oil; my cup runneth over. 

6Surely goodness and mercy shall 
follow me all the days of my life; 

And I shall dwell in the house of the 
LORD for ever. 

 

A Psalm of David. 

 

The earth is the LORD’S, and the 
fulness thereof; 

The world, and they that dwell 
therein. 

2For He hath founded it upon the 
seas, 

And established it upon the floods. 

3Who shall ascend into the mountain 
of the LORD? 

And who shall stand in His holy 
place? 

4He that hath clean hands, and a 
pure heart; 

Who hath not taken My name in 
vain, 

And hath not sworn deceitfully. 

5He shall receive a blessing from the 
LORD, 

And righteousness from the God of 
his salvation. 

6Such is the generation of them that 
seek after Him, 

That seek Thy face, even Jacob. 

 Selah 

 

7Lift up your heads, O ye gates, 

And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting 
doors; 
23 

24 




That the King of glory may come in. 

8'Who is the King of glory?' 

'The LORD strong and mighty, 

The LORD mighty in battle.' 

9Lift up your heads, O ye gates, 

Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting 
doors; 

That the King of glory may come in. 

10'Who then is the King of glory?' 

'The LORD of hosts; 

He is the King of glory.' Selah 

 

[A Psalm] of David. 

 

. Unto Thee, O LORD, do I lift up my 
soul. 

. 2O my God, in Thee have I trusted, 
let me not be ashamed; 

 Let not mine enemies triumph over 
me. 

. 3Yea, none that wait for Thee shall 
be ashamed; 

 They shall be ashamed that deal 
treacherously without cause. 

. 4Show me Thy ways, O LORD; 

 teach me Thy paths. 

.. 5Guide me in Thy truth, and teach 
me; 

 For Thou art the God of my 
salvation; 

 For Thee do I wait all the day. 

. 6Remember, O LORD, Thy 
compassions and Thy mercies; 

 For they have been from of old. 

. 7Remember not the sins of my 
youth, nor my transgressions; 

 According to Thy mercy remember 
Thou me, 

 For Thy goodness' sake, O LORD. 

. 8Good and upright is the LORD; 

 Therefore doth He instruct sinners 
in the way. 

. 9He guideth The humble in justice; 

 And He teacheth the humble His 
way. 

. 10All the paths of the LORD are 
mercy and truth 

 Unto such as keep His covenant and 
His testimonies. 

. 11For Thy name's sake, O LORD, 

 Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great. 

. 12What man is he that feareth the 
LORD? 

 Him will He instruct in the way that 
He should choose. 

. 13His soul shall abide in prosperity; 

 And his seed shall inherit the land. 

. 14The counsel of the LORD is with 
them that fear Him; 

 And His covenant, to make them 
know it. 

. 15Mine eyes are ever toward the 
LORD; 

 For He will bring forth my feet out 
of the net. 

. 16Turn Thee unto me, and be 
gracious unto me; 

 For I am solitary and afflicted. 

. 17The troubles of my heart are 
enlarged; 

 O bring Thou me out of my 
distresses. 

. 18See mine affliction and my travail; 
And forgive all my sins. 

 19Consider how many are mine 
enemies, 

 And the cruel hatred wherewith they 
hate me. 
25 




. 20O keep my soul, and deliver me; 

 Let me not be ashamed, for I have 
taken refuge in Thee. 

. 21Let integrity and uprightness 
preserve me, 

 Because I wait for Thee. 

 

22Redeem Israel, O God, out of all 
his troubles. 

 

[A Psalm] of David. 

 

Judge me, O LORD, for I have 
walked in mine integrity, 

And I have trusted in the LORD 
without wavering. 

2Examine me, O LORD, and try me; 

Test my reins and my heart. 

3For Thy mercy is before mine eyes; 

And I have walked in Thy truth. 

4I have not sat with men of 
falsehood; 

Neither will I go in with 
dissemblers. 

5I hate the gathering of evil doers, 

And will not sit with the wicked. 

6I will wash my hands in innocency; 

So will I compass Thine altar, O 
LORD, 

7That I may make the voice of 
thanksgiving to be heard, 

And tell of all Thy wondrous works. 

 

8LORD, I love the habitation of Thy 
house, 

And the place where Thy glory 
dwelleth. 

9Gather not my soul with sinners, 

Nor my life with men of blood; 

10In whose hands is craftiness, 

And their right hand is full of bribes. 

11But as for me, I will walk in mine 
integrity; 

Redeem me, and be gracious unto 
me. 

12My foot standeth in an even place; 

In the congregations will I bless the 
LORD. 

 

[A Psalm] of David. 

 

The LORD is my light and my 
salvation; whom shall I fear? 

The LORD is the stronghold of my 
life; of whom shall I be afraid? 

2When evil-doers came upon me to 
eat up my flesh, 

Even mine adversaries and my foes, 
they stumbled and fell. 

3Though a host should encamp 
against me, 

My heart shall not fear; 

Though war should rise up against 
me, 

Even then will I be confident. 

 

4One thing have I asked of the LORD, 
that will I seek after: 

That I may dwell in the house of the 
LORD all the days of my life, 

To behold the graciousness of the 
LORD, and to visit early in His 
temple. 

5For He concealeth me in His 
pavilion in the day of evil; 

He hideth me in the covert of His 
tent; 

He lifteth me up upon a rock. 
26 

27 




6And now shall my head be lifted up 
above mine enemies round about 
me; 

And I will offer in His tabernacle 
sacrifices with trumpet-sound; 

I will sing, yea, I will sing praises 
unto the LORD. 

 

7Hear, O LORD, when I call with my 
voice, 

And be gracious unto me, and 
answer me. 

8In Thy behalf my heart hath said: 
‘Seek ye My face'; 

Thy face, LORD, will I seek. 

9Hide not Thy face far from me; 

Put not Thy servant away in anger; 

Thou hast been my help; 

Cast me not off, neither forsake me, 
O God of my salvation. 

10For though my father and my 
mother have forsaken me, 

The LORD will take me up. 

 

11Teach me Thy way, O LORD; 

And lead me in an even path, 

Because of them that lie in wait for 
me. 

12Deliver me not over unto the will 
of mine adversaries; 

For false witnesses are risen up 
against me, and such as breathe 
out violence. 

13If I had not believed to look upon 
the goodness of the LORD 

In the land of the living!— 

14Wait on the LORD; 

Be strong, and let thy heart take 
courage; 

Yea, wait thou for the LORD. 

 

[A Psalm] of David. 

 

Unto thee, O LORD, do I call; 

My Rock, be not Thou deaf unto 
me; 

Lest, if Thou be silent unto me, 

I become like them that go down 
into the pit. 

2Hear the voice of my supplications, 
when I cry unto Thee, 

When I lift up my hands toward Thy 
holy Sanctuary. 

 

3Draw me not away with the 
wicked, 

And with the workers of iniquity; 

Who speak peace with their 
neighbours, 

But evil is in their hearts. 

4Give them according to their deeds, 
and according to the evil of their 
endeavours; 

Give them after the work of their 
hands; 

Render to them their desert. 

5Because they give no heed to the 
works of the LORD, 

Nor to the operation of His hands; 

He will break them down and not 
build them up. 

 

6Blessed be the LORD, 

Because He hath heard the voice of 
my supplications. 

7The LORD is my strength and my 
shield, 

In Him hath my heart trusted, 
28 




And I am helped; 

Therefore my heart greatly 
rejoiceth, 

And with my song will I praise Him. 

 

8The LORD is a strength unto them; 

And He is a stronghold of salvation 
to His anointed. 

9Save Thy people, and bless Thine 
inheritance; 

And tend them, and carry them for 
ever. 

 

A Psalm of David. 

 

Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye sons of 
might, 

Ascribe unto the LORD glory and 
strength. 

2Ascribe unto the LORD the glory 
due unto His name; 

Worship the LORD in the beauty of 
holiness. 

 

3The voice of the LORD is upon the 
waters; 

The God of glory thundereth, 

Even the LORD upon many waters. 

4The voice of the LORD is powerful; 

The voice of the LORD is full of 
majesty. 

5The voice of the LORD breaketh the 
cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh in 
pieces the cedars of Lebanon. 

6He maketh them also to skip like a 
calf; 

Lebanon and Sirion like a young 
wild-ox. 

7The voice of the LORD heweth out 
flames of fire. 

8The voice of the LORD shaketh the 
wilderness; 

The LORD shaketh the wilderness of 
Kadesh. 

9The voice of the LORD maketh the 
hinds to calve, 

And strippeth the forests bare; 

And in His temple all say: 'Glory.' 

 

10The LORD sat enthroned at the 
flood; 

Yea, the LORD sitteth as King for 
ever. 

11The LORD will give strength unto 
His people; 

The LORD will bless his people with 
peace. 

 

A Psalm; a Song at the 
Dedication of the House; of 
David. 

 

2I will extol thee, O LORD, for Thou 
hast raised me up, 

And hast not suffered mine enemies 
to rejoice over me. 

3O LORD my God, 

I cried unto Thee, and Thou didst 
heal me; 

4O LORD, Thou broughtest up my 
soul from the nether-world; 

Thou didst kept me alive, that I 
should not go down to the pit. 

5Sing praise unto the LORD, O ye His 
godly ones, 

And give thanks to His holy name. 

6For His anger is but for a moment, 
29 

30 




His favour is for a life-time; 

Weeping may tarry for the night, 

But joy cometh in the morning. 

 

7Now I had said in my security: ' 

I shall never be moved.' 

8Thou hadst established, O LORD, in 
Thy favour my mountain as a 
stronghold— 

Thou didst hide Thy face; I was 
affrighted. 

9Unto Thee, O LORD, did I call, 

And unto the LORD I made 
supplication: 

10'What profit is there in my blood, 
when I go down to the pit? 

Shall the dust praise Thee? shall it 
declare Thy truth? 

11Hear, O LORD, and be gracious 
unto me; 

LORD, be Thou my helper.' 

 

12Thou didst turn for me my 
mourning into dancing; 

Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and 
gird me with gladness; 

13So that my glory may sing praise 
to Thee, and not be silent; 

O LORD my God, I will give thanks 
unto Thee for ever. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

2In thee, O LORD, have I taken 
refuge; let me never be ashamed; 

Deliver me in Thy righteousness. 

3Incline Thine ear unto me, deliver 
me speedily; 

Be Thou to me a rock of refuge, 
even a fortress of defence, to save 
me. 

4For Thou art my rock and my 
fortress; 

Therefore for Thy name's sake lead 
me and guide me. 

5Bring me forth out of the net that 
they have hidden for me; 

For Thou art my stronghold. 

6Into Thy hand I commit my spirit; 

Thou hast redeemed me, O LORD, 
Thou God of truth. 

7I hate them that regard lying 
vanities; 

But I trust in the LORD. 

8I will be glad and rejoice in Thy 
lovingkindness; 

For Thou hast seen mine affliction, 

Thou hast taken cognizance of the 
troubles of my soul, 

9And Thou hast not given me over 
into the hand of the enemy; 

Thou hast set my feet in a broad 
place. 

 

10Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I 
am in distress; 

Mine eye wasteth away with 
vexation, yea, my soul and my 
body. 

11For my life is spent in sorrow, and 
my years in sighing; 

My strength faileth because of mine 
iniquity, and my bones are wasted 
away. 

12Because of all mine adversaries I 
am become a reproach, 
31 




Yea, unto my neighbours 
exceedingly, and a dread to mine 
acquaintance; 

They that see me without flee from 
me. 

13I am forgotten as a dead man out 
of mind; 

I am like a useless vessel. 

14For I have heard the whispering of 
many, 

Terror on every side; 

While they took counsel together 
against me, 

They devised to take away my life. 

 

15But as for me, I have trusted in 
Thee, O LORD; 

I have said: 'Thou art my God.' 

16My times are in Thy hand; 

Deliver me from the hand of mine 
enemies, and from them that 
persecute me. 

17Make Thy face to shine upon Thy 
servant; 

Save me in Thy lovingkindness. 

18O LORD, let me not be ashamed, 
for I have called upon Thee; 

Let the wicked be ashamed, let them 
be put to silence in the nether-
world. 

19Let the lying lips be dumb, 

Which speak arrogantly against the 
righteous, 

With pride and contempt. 

 

20Oh how abundant is Thy 
goodness, which Thou hast laid 
up for them that fear Thee; 

Which Thou hast wrought for them 
that take their refuge in Thee, in 
the sight of the sons of men! 

21Thou hidest them in the covert of 
Thy presence from the plottings 
of man; 

Thou concealest them in a pavilion 
from the strife of tongues. 

22Blessed be the LORD; 

For He hath shown me His 
wondrous lovingkindness in an 
entrenched city. 

23As for me, I said in my haste: 'I am 
cut off from before Thine eyes'; 

Nevertheless Thou heardest the 
voice of my supplications when I 
cried unto Thee. 

 

24O love the LORD, all ye His godly 
ones; 

The LORD preserveth the faithful, 

And plentifully repayeth him that 
acteth haughtily. 

25Be strong, and let your heart take 
courage, 

All ye that wait for the LORD. 

 

[A Psalm] of David. Maschil. 

 

Happy is he whose transgression is 
forgiven, whose sin is pardoned. 

2Happy is the man unto whom the 
LORD counteth not iniquity, 

And in whose spirit there is no 
guile. 

 

3When I kept silence, my bones 
wore away 
32 




Through my groaning all the day 
long. 

4For day and night Thy hand was 
heavy upon me; 

My sap was turned as in the 
droughts of summer. Selah 

5I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, 
and mine iniquity have I not hid; 

I said: 'I will make confession 
concerning my transgressions 
unto the LORD' — 

And Thou, Thou forgavest the 
iniquity of my sin. Selah 

 

6For this let every one that is godly 
pray unto Thee in a time when 
Thou mayest be found; 

Surely, when the great waters 
overflow, they will not reach unto 
him. 

7Thou art my hiding-place; Thou 
wilt preserve me from the 
adversary; 

With songs of deliverance Thou wilt 
compass me about. Selah 

8'I will instruct thee and teach thee 
in the way which thou shalt go; 

I will give counsel, Mine eye being 
upon thee.' 

9Be ye not as the horse, or as the 
mule, which have no 
understanding; 

Whose mouth must be held in with 
bit and bridle, 

That they come not near unto thee. 

 

10Many are the sorrows of the 
wicked; 

But he that trusteth in the LORD, 
mercy compasseth him about. 

11Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, 
ye righteous; 

And shout for joy, all ye that are 
upright in heart. 

 

Rejoice in the LORD, O ye 
righteous, 

Praise is comely for the upright. 

2Give thanks unto the LORD with 
harp, 

Sing praises unto Him with the 
psaltery of ten strings. 

3Sing unto Him a new song; 

Play skilfully amid shouts of joy. 

 

4For the word of the LORD is upright; 

And all His work is done in 
faithfulness. 

5He loveth righteousness and 
justice; 

The earth is full of the 
lovingkindness of the LORD. 

6By the word of the LORD were the 
heavens made; 

And all the host of them by the 
breath of His mouth. 

7He gathereth the waters of the sea 
together as a heap; 

He layeth up the deeps in 
storehouses. 

8Let all the earth fear the LORD; 

Let all the inhabitants of the world 
stand in awe of Him. 

9For He spoke, and it was; 

He commanded, and it stood. 

10The LORD bringeth the counsel of 
the nations to nought; 
33 




He maketh the thoughts of the 
peoples to be of no effect. 

11The counsel of the LORD standeth 
for ever, 

The thoughts of His heart to all 
generations. 

 

12Happy is the nation whose God is 
the LORD; 

The people whom He hath chosen 
for His own inheritance. 

13The LORD looketh from heaven; 

He beholdeth all the sons of men; 

14From the place of His habitation 
He looketh intently 

Upon all the inhabitants of the earth; 

15He that fashioneth the hearts of 
them all, 

That considereth all their doings. 

16A king is not saved by the 
multitude of a host; 

A mighty man is not delivered by 
great strength. 

17A horse is a vain thing for safety; 

Neither doth it afford escape by its 
great strength. 

18Behold, the eye of the LORD is 
toward them that fear Him, 

Toward them that wait for His 
mercy; 

19To deliver their soul from death, 

And to keep them alive in famine. 

 

20Our soul hath waited for the LORD; 

He is our help and our shield. 

21For in Him doth our heart rejoice, 

Because we have trusted in His holy 
name. 

22Let Thy mercy, O LORD, be upon 
us, 

According as we have waited for 
Thee. 

 

[A Psalm] of David; when he 
changed his demeanour before 
Abimelech, who drove him away, and 
he departed. 

 

. 2I will bless the LORD at all times; 

 His praise shall continually be in my 
mouth. 

. 3My soul shall glory in the LORD; 
The humble shall hear thereof, 
and be glad. 

. 4O magnify the LORD with me, 

 And let us exalt His name together. 

. 5I sought the LORD, and He answered 
me, 

 And delivered me from all my 
fears. 

. 6They looked unto Him, and were 
radiant; 

. And their faces shall never be 
abashed. 

. 7This poor man cried, and the 
LORD heard, 

 And saved him out of all his 
troubles. 

. 8The angel of the LORD encampeth 
round about them that fear Him, 

 And delivereth them. 

. 9O consider and see that the LORD is 
good; 

 Happy is the man that taketh refuge 
in Him. 

. 10O fear the LORD, ye His holy ones; 
34 




 For there is no want to them that 
fear Him. 

. 11The young lions do lack, and 
suffer hunger; 

 But they that seek the LORD want not 
any good thing. 

. 12Come, ye children, hearken unto 
me; 

 I will teach you the fear of the 
LORD. 

. 13Who is the man that desireth life, 
and loveth days, 

 That he may see good therein? 

. 14Keep thy tongue from evil, 

 And thy lips from speaking guile. 

. 15Depart from evil, and do good; 
Seek peace, and pursue it. 

. 16The eyes of the LORD are toward 
the righteous, 

 And His ears are open unto their 
cry. 

. 17The face of the LORD is against 
them that do evil, 

 To cut off the remembrance of them 
from the earth. 

. 18 aThey cried, and the LORD heard, 

a That is, the righteous. 

 And delivered them out of all their 
troubles. 

. 19The LORD is nigh unto them that 
are of a broken heart, 

 And saveth such as are of a contrite 
spirit. 

. 20Many are the ills of the righteous, 

 But the LORD delivereth him out of 
them all. 

. 21He keepeth all his bones; 

 Not one of them is broken. 

. 22Evil shall kill the wicked; 

 And they that hate the righteous 
shall be held guilty. 

 

23The LORD redeemeth the soul of 
His servants; 

And none of them that take refuge 
in Him shall be desolate. 

 

[A Psalm] of David. 

 

Strive, O LORD, with them that strive 
with me; 

Fight against them that fight against 
me. 

2Take hold of shield and buckler, 

And rise up to my help. 

3Draw out also the spear, and the 
battle-axe, against them that 
pursue me; 

Say unto my soul: 'I am Thy 
salvation.' 

4Let them be ashamed and brought 
to confusion that seek after my 
soul; 

Let them be turned back and be 
abashed that devise my hurt. 

5Let them be as chaff before the 
wind, 

The angel of the LORD thrusting 
them. 

6Let their way be dark and slippery, 

The angel of the LORD pursuing 
them. 

7For without cause have they hid for 
me the pit, even their net, 

Without cause have they digged for 
my soul. 
35 




8Let destruction come upon him 
unawares; 

And let his net that he hath hid catch 
himself; 

With destruction let him fall therein. 

9And my soul shall be joyful in the 
LORD; 

It shall rejoice in His salvation. 

10All my bones shall say: 'LORD, who 
is like unto Thee, 

Who deliverest the poor from him 
that is too strong for him, 

Yea, the poor and the needy from 
him that spoileth him?' 

 

11Unrighteous witnesses rise up; 

They ask me of things that I know 
not. 

12They repay me evil for good; 

Bereavement is come to my soul. 

13But as for me, when they were 
sick, my clothing was sackcloth, 

I afflicted my soul with fasting; 

And my prayer, may it return into 
mine own bosom. 

14I went about as though it had been 
my friend or my brother; 

I bowed down mournful, as one that 
mourneth for his mother. 

15But when I halt they rejoice, and 
gather themselves together; 

The abjects gather themselves 
together against me, and those 
whom I know not; 

They tear me, and cease not; 

16With the profanest mockeries of 
backbiting 

They gnash at me with their teeth. 

 

17Lord, how long wilt Thou look on? 

Rescue my soul from their 
destructions, 

Mine only one from the lions. 

18I will give Thee thanks in the great 
congregation; 

I will praise Thee among a 
numerous people. 

19Let not them that are wrongfully 
mine enemies rejoice over me; 

Neither let them wink with the eye 
that hate me without a cause. 

20For they speak not peace; 

But they devise deceitful matters 
against them that are quiet in the 
land. 

21Yea, they open their mouth wide 
against me; 

They say: 'Aha, aha, our eye hath 
seen it.' 

22Thou hast seen, O LORD; keep not 
silence; 

O Lord, be not far from me. 

23Rouse Thee, and awake to my 
judgment, 

Even unto my cause, my God and 
my Lord. 

24Judge me, O LORD my God, 
according to Thy righteousness; 

And let them not rejoice over me. 

25Let them not say in their heart: 
'Aha, we have our desire'; 

Let them not say: 'We have 
swallowed him up.' 

26Let them be ashamed and abashed 
together that rejoice at my hurt; 

Let them be clothed with shame and 
confusion that magnify 
themselves against me. 


27Let them shout for joy, and be 
glad, that delight in my 
righteousness; 

Yea, let them say continually: 
'Magnified be the LORD, 

Who delighteth in the peace of His 
servant.' 

28And my tongue shall speak of Thy 
righteousness, 

And of Thy praise all the day. 

 

For the Leader. [A Psalm] of 
David the servant of the LORD. 

 

2Transgression speaketh to the 
wicked, methinks— 

There is no fear of God before his 
eyes. 

3For it flattereth him in his eyes, 

Until his iniquity be found, and he 
be hated. 

4The words of his mouth are iniquity 
and deceit; 

He hath left off to be wise, to do 
good. 

5He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; 

He setteth himself in a way that is 
not good; 

He abhorreth not evil. 

 

6Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, is in 
the heavens; 

Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the 
skies. 

7Thy righteousness is like the 
mighty mountains; 

Thy judgments are like the great 
deep; 

Man and beast Thou preservest, O 
LORD. 

8How precious is Thy 
lovingkindness, O God! 

And the children of men take refuge 
in the shadow of Thy wings. 

9They are abundantly satisfied with 
the fatness of Thy house; 

And Thou makest them drink of the 
river of Thy pleasures. 

10For with Thee is the fountain of 
life; 

In Thy light do we see light. 

 

11O continue Thy lovingkindness 
unto them that know Thee; 

And Thy righteousness to the 
upright in heart. 

12Let not the foot of pride overtake 
me, 

And let not the hand of the wicked 
drive me away. 

13There are the workers of iniquity 
fallen; 

They are thrust down, and are not 
able to rise. 

 

[A Psalm] of David. 

 

. Fret not thyself because of evil-
doers, 

 Neither be thou envious against 
them that work unrighteousness. 

 2For they shall soon wither like the 
grass, 

 And fade as the green herb. 

 

. 3Trust in the LORD, and do good; 
36 

37 




 Dwell in the land, and cherish 
faithfulness. 

 4So shalt thou delight thyself in the 
LORD; 

 And He shall give thee the petitions 
of thy heart. 

 

. 5Commit thy way unto the LORD; 

 Trust also in Him, and He will bring 
it to pass. 

 6And He will make thy righteous-
ness to go forth as the light, 

 And thy right as the noonday. 

 

. 7Resign thyself unto the LORD, and 
wait patiently for Him; 

 Fret not thyself because of him who 
prospereth in his way, 

 Because of the man who bringeth 
wicked devices to pass. 

 

. 8Cease from anger, and forsake 
wrath; 

 Fret not thyself, it tendeth only to 
evil-doing. 

 9For evil-doers shall be cut off; 

 But those that wait for the LORD, 
they shall inherit the land. 

 

. 10And yet a little while, and the 
wicked is no more; 

 Yea, thou shalt look well at his 
place, and he is not. 

 11But the humble shall inherit the 
land, 

 And delight themselves in the 
abundance of peace. 

 

. 12The wicked plotteth against the 
righteous, 

 And gnasheth at him with his teeth. 

 13The Lord doth laugh at him; 

 For He seeth that his day is coming. 

 

. 14The wicked have drawn out the 
sword, and have bent their bow; 

 To cast down the poor and needy, 

 To slay such as are upright in the 
way; 

 15Their sword shall enter into their 
own heart, 

 And their bows shall be broken. 

 

. 16Better is a little that the righteous 
hath 

 Than the abundance of many 
wicked. 

 17For the arms of the wicked shall be 
broken; 

 But the LORD upholdeth the 
righteous. 

 

. 18The LORD knoweth the days of 
them that are wholehearted; 

 And their inheritance shall be for 
ever. 

 19They shall not be ashamed in the 
time of evil; 

 And in the days of famine they shall 
be satisfied. 

 

. 20For the wicked shall perish, 

 And the enemies of the LORD shall 
be as the fat of lambs— 

 They shall pass away in smoke, they 
shall pass away. 

 


. 21The wicked borroweth, and payeth 
not; 

 But the righteous dealeth graciously, 
and giveth. 

 22For such as are blessed of Him 
shall inherit the land; 

 And they that are cursed of Him 
shall be cut off. 

 

. 23It is of the LORD that a man's 
goings are established; 

 And He delighted in his way. 

 24Though he fall, he shall not be 
utterly cast down; 

 For the LORD upholdeth his hand. 

 

. 25I have been young, and now am 
old; 

 Yet have I not seen the righteous 
forsaken, 

 Nor his seed begging bread. 

 26All the day long he dealeth 
graciously, and lendeth; 

 And his seed is blessed. 

 

. 27Depart from evil, and do good; 

 And dwell for evermore. 

 28For the LORD loveth justice, 

 And forsaketh not His saints; 

 They are preserved for ever; 

 But the seed of the wicked shall be 
cut off. 

 29The righteous shall inherit the 
land, 

 And dwell therein for ever. 

 

. 30The mouth of the righteous 
uttereth wisdom, 

 And his tongue speaketh justice. 

 31The law of his God is in his heart; 

 None of his steps slide. 

 

. 32The wicked watcheth the 
righteous, 

 And seeketh to slay him. 

 33The LORD will not leave him in his 
hand, 

 Nor suffer him to be condemned 
when he is judged. 

 

. 34Wait for the LORD, and keep His 
way, 

 And He will exalt thee to inherit the 
land; 

 When the wicked are cut off, thou 
shalt see it. 

 

. 35I have seen the wicked in great 
power, 

 And spreading himself like a leafy 
tree in its native soil. 

 36But one passed by, and, lo, he was 
not; 

 Yea, I sought him, but he could not 
be found. 

 

. 37Mark the man of integrity, and 
behold the upright; 

 For there is a future for the man of 
peace. 

 38But transgressors shall be 
destroyed together; 

 The future of the wicked shall be cut 
off. 

 

. 39But the salvation of the righteous 
is of the LORD; 


He is their stronghold in the time of 
trouble. 

40And the LORD helpeth them, and 
delivereth them; 

He delivereth them from the 
wicked, and saveth them, 

Because they have taken refuge in 
Him. 

 

A Psalm of David, to make 
memorial. 

 

2O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine 
anger; 

Neither chasten me in Thy wrath. 

3For Thine arrows are gone deep 
into me, 

And Thy hand is come down upon 
me. 

4There is no soundness in my flesh 
because of Thine indignation; 

Neither is there any health in my 
bones because of my sin. 

5For mine iniquities are gone over 
my head; 

As a heavy burden they are too 
heavy for me. 

6My wounds are noisome, they 
fester, 

Because of my foolishness. 

7I am bent and bowed down greatly; 

I go mourning all the day. 

8For my loins are filled with 
burning; 

And there is no soundness in my 
flesh. 

9I am benumbed and sore crushed; 

I groan by reason of the moaning of 
my heart. 

 

10Lord, all my desire is before Thee; 

And my sighing is not hid from 
Thee. 

11My heart fluttereth, my strength 
faileth me; 

As for the light of mine eyes, it also 
is gone from me. 

12My friends and my companions 
stand aloof from my plague; 

And my kinsmen stand afar off. 

13They also that seek after my life 
lay snares for me; 

And they that seek my hurt speak 
crafty devices, 

And utter deceits all the day. 

14But I am as a deaf man, I hear not; 

And I am as a dumb man that 
openeth not his mouth. 

15Yea, I am become as a man that 
heareth not, 

And in whose mouth are no 
arguments. 

 

16For in Thee, O LORD, do I hope; 

Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God. 

17For I said: 'Lest they rejoice over 
me; 

When my foot slippeth, they 
magnify themselves against me.' 

18For I am ready to halt, 

And my pain is continually before 
me. 

19For I do declare mine iniquity; 

I am full of care because of my sin. 

20But mine enemies are strong in 
health; 

And they that hate me wrongfully 
are multiplied. 
38 




21They also that repay evil for good 

Are adversaries unto me, because I 
follow the thing that is good. 

22Forsake me not, O LORD; 

O my God, be not far from me. 

23Make haste to help me, 

O Lord, my salvation. 

 

For the Leader, for Jeduthun. 
A Psalm of David. 

 

2I said: 'I will take heed to my ways, 

That I sin not with my tongue; 

I will keep a curb upon my mouth, 

While the wicked is before me.' 

3I was dumb with silence; I held my 
peace, had no comfort; 

And my pain was held in check. 

4My heart waxed hot within me; 

While I was musing, the fire 
kindled; 

Then spoke I with my tongue: 

 

5'LORD, make me to know mine end, 

And the measure of my days, what it 
is; 

Let me know how short-lived I am. 

6Behold, Thou hast made my days 
as hand-breadths; 

And mine age is as nothing before 
Thee; 

Surely every man at his best estate 
is altogether vanity. Selah 

7Surely man walketh as a mere 
semblance; 

Surely for vanity they are in turmoil; 

He heapeth up riches, and knoweth 
not who shall gather them. 

 

8And now, Lord, what wait I for? 

My hope, it is in Thee. 

9Deliver me from all my 
transgressions; 

Make me not the reproach of the 
base. 

10I am dumb, I open not my mouth; 

Because Thou hast done it. 

11Remove Thy stroke from off me; 

I am consumed by the blow of Thy 
hand. 

12With rebukes dost Thou chasten 
man for iniquity, 

And like a moth Thou makest his 
beauty to consume away; 

Surely every man is vanity. Selah 

 

13Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give 
ear unto my cry; 

Keep not silence at my tears; 

For I am a stranger with Thee, 

A sojourner, as all my fathers were. 

14Look away from me, that I may 
take comfort, 

Before I go hence, and be no more.' 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

2I waited patiently for the LORD; 

And He inclined unto me, and heard 
my cry. 

3He brought me up also out of the 
tumultuous pit, out of the miry 
clay; 

And He set my feet upon a rock, He 
established my goings. 

4And He hath put a new song in my 
mouth, even praise unto our God; 
39 

40 




Many shall see, and fear, 

And shall trust in the LORD. 

 

5Happy is the man that hath made 
the LORD his trust, 

And hath not turned unto the 
arrogant, nor unto such as fall 
away treacherously. 

6Many things hast Thou done, O 
LORD my God, 

Even Thy wonderful works, and 
Thy thoughts toward us; 

There is none to be compared unto 
Thee! 

If I would declare and speak of 
them, 

They are more than can be told. 

7Sacrifice and meal-offering Thou 
hast no delight in; 

Mine ears hast Thou opened; 

Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast 
Thou not required. 

8Then said I: 'Lo, I am come 

With the roll of a book which is 
prescribed for me; 

9I delight to do Thy will, O my God; 

Yea, Thy law is in my inmost parts.' 

10I have preached righteousness in 
the great congregation, 

Lo, I did not refrain my lips; 

O LORD, Thou knowest. 

11I have not hid Thy righteousness 
within my heart; 

I have declared Thy faithfulness and 
Thy salvation; 

I have not concealed Thy mercy and 
Thy truth from the great 
congregation. 

12Thou, O LORD, wilt not withhold 
Thy compassions from me; 

Let Thy mercy and Thy truth 
continually preserve me. 

 

13For innumerable evils have 
compassed me about, 

Mine iniquities have overtaken me, 
so that I am not able to look up; 

They are more than the hairs of my 
head, and my heart hath failed 
me. 

14Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; 

O LORD, make haste to help me. 

15Let them be ashamed and abashed 
together 

That seek after my soul to sweep it 
away; 

Let them be turned backward and 
brought to confusion 

That delight in my hurt. 

16Let them be appalled by reason of 
their shame 

That say unto me: 'Aha, aha.' 

17Let all those that seek Thee rejoice 
and be glad in Thee; 

Let such as love Thy salvation say 
continually: 

'The LORD be magnified.' 

18But, as for me, that am poor and 
needy, 

The Lord will account it unto me; 

Thou art my help and my deliverer; 

O my God, tarry not. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 
41 




2Happy is he that considereth the 
poor; 

The LORD will deliver him in the day 
of evil. 

3The LORD preserve him, and keep 
him alive, let him be called happy 
in the land; 

And deliver not Thou him unto the 
greed of his enemies. 

4The LORD support him upon the bed 
of illness; 

Mayest Thou turn all his lying down 
in his sickness. 

 

5As for me, I said: 'O LORD, be 
gracious unto me; 

Heal my soul; for I have sinned 
against Thee.' 

6Mine enemies speak evil of me: 

'When shall he die, and his name 
perish?' 

7And if one come to see me, he 
speaketh falsehood; 

His heart gathereth iniquity to itself; 

When he goeth abroad, he speaketh 
of it. 

8All that hate me whisper together 
against me, 

Against me do they devise my hurt: 

9'An evil thing cleaveth fast unto 
him; 

And now that he lieth, he shall rise 
up no more.' 

10Yea, mine own familiar friend, in 
whom I trusted, who did eat of 
my bread, 

Hath lifted up his heel against me. 

 

11But Thou, O LORD, be gracious 
unto me, and raise me up, 

That I may requite them. 

12By this I know that Thou 
delightest in me, 

That mine enemy doth not triumph 
over me. 

13And as for me, Thou upholdest me 
because of mine integrity, 

And settest me before Thy face for 
ever. 

14Blessed be the LORD, the God of 
Israel, 

From everlasting and to everlasting. 

Amen, and Amen. 

 

 

For the Leader; Maschil of the 
sons of Korah. 

 

2As the hart panteth after the water 
brooks, 

So panteth my soul after Thee, O 
God. 

3My soul thirsteth for God, for the 
living God: 

'When shall I come and appear 
before God?' 

4My tears have been my food day 
and night, 

While they say unto me all the day: 
'Where is Thy God?' 

5These things I remember, and pour 
out my soul within me, 
42 




How I passed on with the throng, 
and led them to the house of God, 

With the voice of joy and praise, a 
multitude keeping holyday. 

6Why art thou cast down, O my 
soul? 

And why moanest thou within me? 
Hope thou in God; for I shall yet 
praise Him 

For the salvation of His 
countenance. 

 

7O my God, my soul is cast down 
within me; 

Therefore do I remember Thee from 
the land of Jordan, 

And the Hermons, from the hill 
Mizar. 

8Deep calleth unto deep at the voice 
of Thy cataracts; 

All Thy waves and Thy billows are 
gone over me. 

9By day the LORD will command His 
lovingkindness, 

And in the night His song shall be 
with me, 

Even a prayer unto the God of my 
life. 

10I will say unto God my Rock: 
'Why hast Thou forgotten me? 

Why go I mourning under the 
oppression of the enemy?' 

11As with a crushing in my bones, 
mine adversaries taunt me; 

While they say unto me all the day: 
'Where is Thy God?' 

12Why art thou cast down, O my 
soul? 

And why moanest thou within me? 

Hope thou in God; for I shall yet 
praise Him, 

The salvation of my countenance, 
and my God. 

 

Be Thou my judge, O God, 
and plead my cause against 
an ungodly nation; 

O deliver me from the deceitful and 
unjust man. 

2For Thou art the God of my 
strength; why hast Thou cast me 
off? 

Why go I mourning under the 
oppression of the enemy? 

3O send out Thy light and Thy truth; 
let them lead me; 

Let them bring me unto Thy holy 
mountain, and to Thy dwelling-
places. 

4Then will I go unto the altar of 
God, unto God, my exceeding 
joy; 

And praise Thee upon the harp, O 
God, my God. 

5Why art thou cast down, O my 
soul? 

And why moanest thou within me? 

Hope thou in God; for I shall yet 
praise Him, 

The salvation of my countenance, 
and my God. 

 

For the Leader; [a Psalm] of 
the sons of Korah. Maschil. 

 

2O God, we have heard with our 
ears, our fathers have told us; 
43 

44 




A work Thou didst in their days, in 
the days of old. 

3Thou with Thy hand didst drive out 
the nations, and didst plant them 
in; 

Thou didst break the peoples, and 
didst spread them abroad. 

4For not by their own sword did 
they get the land in possession, 

Neither did their own arm save 
them; 

But Thy right hand, and Thine arm, 
and the light of Thy countenance, 

Because Thou wast favourable unto 
them. 

 

5Thou art my King, O God; 

Command the salvation of Jacob. 

6Through Thee do we push down 
our adversaries; 

Through Thy name do we tread 
them under that rise up against us. 

7For I trust not in my bow, 

Neither can my sword save me. 

8But Thou hast saved us from our 
adversaries, 

And hast put them to shame that 
hate us. 

9In God have we gloried all the day, 

And we will give thanks unto Thy 
name for ever. Selah 

 

10Yet Thou hast cast off, and 
brought us to confusion; 

And goest not forth with our hosts. 

11Thou makest us to turn back from 
the adversary; 

And they that hate us spoil at their 
will. 

12Thou hast given us like sheep to be 
eaten; 

And hast scattered us among the 
nations. 

13Thou sellest Thy people for small 
gain, 

And hast not set their prices high. 

14Thou makest us a taunt to our 
neighbours, 

A scorn and a derision to them that 
are round about us. 

15Thou makest us a byword among 
the nations, 

A shaking of the head among the 
peoples. 

16All the day is my confusion before 
me, 

And the shame of my face hath 
covered me, 

17For the voice of him that taunteth 
and blasphemeth; 

By reason of the enemy and the 
revengeful. 

 

18All this is come upon us; yet have 
we not forgotten Thee, 

Neither have we been false to Thy 
covenant. 

19Our heart is not turned back, 

Neither have our steps declined 
from Thy path; 

20Though Thou hast crushed us into 
a place of jackals, 

And covered us with the shadow of 
death. 

21If we had forgotten the name of 
our God, 

Or spread forth our hands to a 
strange god; 


22Would not God search this out? 

For He knoweth the secrets of the 
heart. 

23Nay, but for Thy sake are we 
killed all the day; 

We are accounted as sheep for the 
slaughter. 

 

24Awake, why sleepest Thou, O 
Lord? 

Arouse Thyself, cast not off for 
ever. 

25Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, 

And forgettest our affliction and our 
oppression? 

26For our soul is bowed down to the 
dust; 

Our belly cleaveth unto the earth. 

27Arise for our help, 

And redeem us for Thy mercy's 
sake. 

 

For the Leader; upon 
Shoshannim; [a Psalm] of the 
sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of

2My heart overfloweth with a 
goodly matter; 

I say: 'My work is concerning a 
king'; 

My tongue is the pen of a ready 
writer. 

 

3Thou art fairer than the children of 
men; 

Grace is poured upon thy lips; 

Therefore God hath blessed thee for 
ever. 

4Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O 
mighty one, 

Thy glory and thy majesty. 

5And in thy majesty prosper, ride 
on, 

In behalf of truth and meekness and 
righteousness; 

And let thy right hand teach thee 
tremendous things. 

6Thine arrows are sharp— 

The peoples fall under thee— 

[They sink] into the heart of the 
king's enemies. 

7Thy throne given of God is for ever 
and ever; 

A sceptre of equity is the sceptre of 
thy kingdom. 

8Thou hast loved righteousness, and 
hated wickedness; 

Therefore God, thy God, hath 
anointed thee 

With the oil of gladness above thy 
fellows. 

9Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia are all 
thy garments; 

Out of ivory palaces stringed 
instruments have made thee glad. 

10Kings' daughters are among thy 
favourites; 

At thy right hand doth stand the 
queen in gold of Ophir. 

11'Hearken, O daughter, and 
consider, and incline thine ear; 

Forget also thine own people, and 
thy father's house; 

12So shall the king desire thy beauty; 

For he is thy lord; and do homage 
unto him. 
45 




13And, O daughter of Tyre, the 
richest of the people 

Shall entreat thy favour with a gift.' 

14All glorious is the king's daughter 
within the palace; 

Her raiment is of chequer work 
inwrought with gold. 

15She shall be led unto the king on 
richly woven stuff; 

The virgins her companions in her 
train being brought unto thee. 

16They shall be led with gladness 
and rejoicing; 

They shall enter into the king's 
palace. 

17Instead of thy fathers shall be thy 
sons, 

Whom thou shalt make princes in all 
the land. 

18I will make thy name to be 
remembered in all generations; 

Therefore shall the peoples praise 
thee for ever and ever. 

 

For the Leader; [a Psalm] of 
the sons of Korah; upon

2God is our refuge and strength, 

A very present help in trouble. 

3Therefore will we not fear, though 
the earth do change, 

And though the mountains be 
moved into the heart of the seas; 

4Though the waters thereof roar and 
foam, 

Though the mountains shake at the 
swelling thereof. Selah 

 

5There is a river, the streams 
whereof make glad the city of 
God, 

The holiest dwelling-place of the 
Most High. 

6God is in the midst of her, she shall 
not be moved; 

God shall help her, at the approach 
of morning. 

7Nations were in tumult, kingdoms 
were moved; 

He uttered His voice, the earth 
melted. 

8The LORD of hosts is with us; 

The God of Jacob is our high tower. 
Selah 

 

9Come, behold the works of the 
LORD, 

Who hath made desolations in the 
earth. 

10He maketh wars to cease unto the 
end of the earth; 

He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the 
spear in sunder; 

He burneth the chariots in the fire. 

11'Let be, and know that I am God; 

I will be exalted among the nations, 
I will be exalted in the earth.' 

12The LORD of hosts is with us; 

The God of Jacob is our high tower.

2O clap your hands, all ye peoples; 

Shout unto God with the voice of 
triumph. 
46 

47 




3For the LORD is most high, awful; 

A great King over all the earth. 

4He subdueth peoples under us, 

And nations under our feet. 

5He chooseth our inheritance for us, 

The pride of Jacob whom He loveth. 
Selah 

 

6God is gone up amidst shouting, 

The LORD amidst the sound of the 
horn. 

7Sing praises to God, sing praises; 

Sing praises unto our King, sing 
praises. 

 

8For God is the King of all the earth; 

Sing ye praises in a skilful song. 

9God reigneth over the nations; 

God sitteth upon His holy throne. 

 

10The princes of the peoples are 
gathered together, 

The people of the God of Abraham; 

For unto God belong the shields of 
the earth; 

He is greatly exalted. 

 

A Song; a Psalm of the sons of 
Korah. 

 

2Great is the LORD, and highly to be 
praised, 

In the city of our God, His holy 
mountain, 

3Fair in situation, the joy of the 
whole earth; 

Even mount Zion, the uttermost 
parts of the north, 

The city of the great King. 

4God in her palaces 

Hath made Himself known for a 
stronghold. 

 

5For, lo, the kings assembled 
themselves, 

They came onward together. 

6They saw, straightway they were 
amazed; 

They were affrighted, they hasted 
away. 

7Trembling took hold of them there, 

Pangs, as of a woman in travail. 

8With the east wind 

Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish. 

9As we have heard, so have we seen 

In the city of the LORD of hosts, in 
the city of our God— 

God establish it for ever. Selah 

 

10We have thought on Thy 
lovingkindness, O God, 

In the midst of Thy temple. 

11As is Thy name, O God, 

So is Thy praise unto the ends of the 
earth; 

Thy right hand is full of 
righteousness. 

12Let mount Zion be glad, 

Let the daughters of Judah rejoice, 

Because of Thy judgments. 

13Walk about Zion, and go round 
about her; 

Count the towers thereof. 

14Mark ye well her ramparts, 

Traverse her palaces; 

That ye may tell it to the generation 
following. 
48 




15For such is God, our God, for ever 
and ever; 

He will guide us eternally. 

 

For the Leader; a Psalm of the 
sons of Korah. 

 

2Hear this, all ye peoples; 

Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the 
world, 

3Both low and high, 

Rich and poor together. 

4My mouth shall speak wisdom, 

And the meditation of my heart shall 
be understanding. 

5I will incline mine ear to a parable; 

I will open my dark saying upon the 
harp. 

 

6Wherefore should I fear in the days 
of evil, 

When the iniquity of my supplanters 
compasseth me about, 

7Of them that trust in their wealth, 

And boast themselves in the 
multitude of their riches? 

8No man can by any means redeem 
his brother, 

Nor give to God a ransom for him— 

9For too costly is the redemption of 
their soul, 

And must be let alone for ever— 

10That he should still live alway, 

That he should not see the pit. 

11For he seeth that wise men die, 

The fool and the brutish together 
perish, 

And leave their wealth to others. 

12Their inward thought is, that their 
houses shall continue for ever, 

And their dwelling-places to all 
generations; 

They call their lands after their own 
names. 

13But man abideth not in honour; 

He is like the beasts that perish. 

 

14This is the way of them that are 
foolish, 

And of those who after them 
approve their sayings. Selah 

15Like sheep they are appointed for 
the nether-world; 

Death shall be their shepherd; 

And the upright shall have dominion 
over them in the morning; 

And their form shall be for the 
nether-world to wear away, 

That there be no habitation for it. 

16But God will redeem my soul from 
the power of the nether-world; 

For He shall receive me. Selah 

17Be not thou afraid when one 
waxeth rich, 

When the wealth of his house is 
increased; 

18For when he dieth he shall carry 
nothing away; 

His wealth shall not descend after 
him. 

19Though while he lived he blessed 
his soul: 

'Men will praise thee, when thou 
shalt do well to thyself'; 

20It shall go to the generation of his 
fathers; 

They shall never see the light.

21Man that is in honour 
understandeth not; 

He is like the beasts that perish. 

 

A Psalm of Asaph. 

 

God, God, the LORD, hath spoken, 
and called the earth 

From the rising of the sun unto the 
going down thereof. 

 

2Out of Zion, the perfection of 
beauty, 

God hath shined forth. 

3Our God cometh, and doth not keep 
silence; 

A fire devoureth before Him, 

And round about Him it stormeth 
mightily. 

4He calleth to the heavens above, 

And to the earth, that He may judge 
His people: 

5'Gather My saints together unto 
Me; 

Those that have made a covenant 
with Me by sacrifice.' 

6And the heavens declare His 
righteousness; 

For God, He is judge. Selah 

7'Hear, O My people, and I will 
speak; 

O Israel, and I will testify against 
thee: 

God, thy God, am I. 

8I will not reprove thee for thy 
sacrifices; 

And thy burnt-offerings are 
continually before Me. 

9I will take no bullock out of thy 
house, 

Nor he-goats out of thy folds. 

10For every beast of the forest is 
Mine, 

And the cattle upon a thousand hills. 

11I know all the fowls of the 
mountains; 

And the wild beasts of the field are 
Mine. 

12If I were hungry, I would not tell 
thee; 

For the world is Mine, and the 
fulness thereof. 

13Do I eat the flesh of bulls, 

Or drink the blood of goats? 

14Offer unto God the sacrifice of 
thanksgiving; 

And pay thy vows unto the Most 
High; 

15And call upon Me in the day of 
trouble; 

I will deliver thee, and thou shalt 
honour Me.' 

 

16But unto the wicked God saith: 

'What hast thou to do to declare My 
statutes, 

And that thou hast taken My 
covenant in thy mouth? 

17Seeing thou hatest instruction, 

And castest My words behind thee. 

18When thou sawest a thief, thou 
hadst company with him, 

And with adulterers was thy portion. 

19Thou hast let loose thy mouth for 
evil, 

And thy tongue frameth deceit. 
50 




20Thou sittest and speakest against 
thy brother; 

Thou slanderest thine own mother's 
son. 

21These things hast thou done, and 
should I have kept silence? 

Thou hadst thought that I was 
altogether such a one as thyself; 

But I will reprove thee, and set the 
cause before thine eyes. 

 

22Now consider this, ye that forget 
God, 

Lest I tear in pieces, and there be 
none to deliver. 

23Whoso offereth the sacrifice of 
thanksgiving honoureth Me; 

And to him that ordereth his way 
aright 

Will I show the salvation of God.' 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David; 2when Nathan the 
prophet came unto him, after he had 
gone in to Bath-sheba. 

 

3Be gracious unto me, O God, 
according to Thy mercy; 

According to the multitude of Thy 
compassions blot out my 
transgressions. 

4Wash me thoroughly from mine 
iniquity, 

And cleanse me from my sin. 

5For I know my transgressions; 

And my sin is ever before me. 

6Against Thee, Thee only, have I 
sinned, 

And done that which is evil in Thy 
sight; 

That Thou mayest be justified when 
Thou speakest, 

And be in the right when Thou 
judgest. 

 

7Behold, I was brought forth in 
iniquity, 

And in sin did my mother conceive 
me. 

8Behold, Thou desirest truth in the 
inward parts; 

Make me, therefore, to know 
wisdom in mine inmost heart. 

9Purge me with hyssop, and I shall 
be clean; 

Wash me, and I shall be whiter than 
snow. 

10Make me to hear joy and gladness; 

That the bones which Thou hast 
crushed may rejoice. 

11Hide Thy face from my sins, 

Aand blot out all mine iniquities. 

12Create me a clean heart, O God; 

And renew a stedfast spirit within 
me. 

13Cast me not away from Thy 
presence; 

And take not Thy holy spirit from 
me. 

14Restore unto me the joy of Thy 
salvation; 

And let a willing spirit uphold me. 

15Then will I teach transgressors 
Thy ways; 

And sinners shall return unto Thee. 
51 




16Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, 
O God, Thou God of my 
salvation; 

So shall my tongue sing aloud of 
Thy righteousness. 

17O Lord, open Thou my lips; 

And my mouth shall declare Thy 
praise. 

18For Thou delightest not in 
sacrifice, else would I give it; 

Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-
offering. 

19The sacrifices of God are a broken 
spirit; 

A broken and a contrite heart, O 
God, Thou wilt not despise. 

 

20Do good in Thy favour unto Zion; 

Build Thou the walls of Jerusalem. 

21Then wilt Thou delight in the 
sacrifices of righteousness, in 
burnt-offering and whole 
offering; 

Then will they offer bullocks upon 
Thine altar. 

 

For the Leader. Maschil of 
David; 2when Doeg the 
Edomite came and told Saul, and said 
unto him: 'David is come to the house 
of Ahimelech.' 

 

3Why boastest thou thyself of evil, 
O mighty man? 

The mercy of God endureth 
continually. 

4Thy tongue deviseth destruction; 

Like a sharp razor, working 
deceitfully. 

 

5Thou lovest evil more than good; 

Falsehood rather than speaking 
righteousness. Selah 

6Thou lovest all devouring words, 

The deceitful tongue. 

7God will likewise break thee for 
ever, 

He will take thee up, and pluck thee 
out of thy tent, 

And root thee out of the land of the 
living. Selah 

 

8The righteous also shall see, and 
fear, 

And shall laugh at him: 

9'Lo, this is the man that made not 
God his stronghold; 

But trusted in the abundance of his 
riches, 

And strengthened himself in his 
wickedness.' 

10But as for me, I am like a leafy 
olive-tree in the house of God; 

I trust in the mercy of God for ever 
and ever. 

11I will give Thee thanks for ever, 
because Thou hast done it; 

And I will wait for Thy name, for it 
is good, in the presence of Thy 
saints. 

 

For the Leader; upon 
Mahalath. Maschil of David. 

 

2The fool hath said in his heart: 
'There is no God'; 

They have dealt corruptly, and have 
done abominable iniquity; 
52 

53 




There is none that doeth good. 

3God looked forth from heaven 
upon the children of men, 

To see if there were any man of 
understanding, that did seek after 
God. 

4Every one of them is unclean, they 
are together become impure; 

There is none that doeth good, no, 
not one. 

 

5’Shall not the workers of iniquity 
know it, 

Who eat up My people as they eat 
bread, 

And call not upon God?' 

6There are they in great fear, where 
no fear was; 

For God hath scattered the bones of 
him that encampeth against thee; 

Thou hast put them to shame, 
because God hath rejected them. 

 

7Oh that the salvation of Israel were 
come out of Zion! 

When God turneth the captivity of 
His people, 

Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad. 

 

For the Leader; with string-
music. Maschil of David: 
2when the Ziphites came and said to 
Saul: 'Doth not David hide himself 
with us?' 

 

3O God, save me by Thy name, 

And right me by Thy might. 

4O God, hear my prayer; give ear to 
the words of my mouth. 

5For strangers are risen up against 
me, 

And violent men have sought after 
my soul; 

They have not set God before them. 
Selah 

6Behold, God is my helper; 

The Lord is for me as the upholder 
of my soul. 

7He will requite the evil unto them 
that lie in wait for me; 

Destroy Thou them in Thy truth. 

8With a freewill-offering will I 
sacrifice unto Thee; 

I will give thanks unto Thy name, O 
LORD, for it is good. 

9For He hath delivered me out of all 
trouble; 

And mine eye hath gazed upon mine 
enemies. 

 

For the Leader; with string-
music. Maschil of David. 

 

2Give ear, O God, to my prayer; 

And hide not Thyself from my 
supplication. 

3Attend unto me, and answer me; 

I am distraught in my complaint, 
and will moan; 

4Because of the voice of the enemy, 

Because of the oppression of the 
wicked; 

For they cast mischief upon me, 

And in anger they persecute me. 

5My heart doth writhe within me; 

And the terrors of death are fallen 
upon me. 

6Fear and trembling come upon me, 
54 

55 




And horror hath overwhelmed me. 

7And I said: 'Oh that I had wings 
like a dove! 

Then would I fly away, and be at 
rest. 

8Lo, then would I wander far off, 

I would lodge in the wilderness. 

Selah 

9I would haste me to a shelter 

From the stormy wind and tempest.' 

10Destroy, O Lord, and divide their 
tongue; 

For I have seen violence and strife 
in the city. 

11Day and night they go about it 
upon the walls thereof; 

Iniquity also and mischief are in the 
midst of it. 

12Wickedness is in the midst thereof; 

Oppression and guile depart not 
from her broad place. 

13For it was not an enemy that 
taunted me, 

Then I could have borne it; 

Neither was it mine adversary that 
did magnify himself against me, 

Then I would have hid myself from 
him. 

14But it was thou, a man mine equal, 

My companion, and my familiar 
friend; 

15We took sweet counsel together, 

In the house of God we walked with 
the throng. 

16May He incite death against them, 

Let them go down alive into the 
nether-world; 

For evil is in their dwelling, and 
within them. 

 

17As for me, I will call upon God; 

And the LORD shall save me. 

18Evening, and morning, and at 
noon, will I complain, and moan; 

And He hath heard my voice. 

19He hath redeemed my soul in 
peace so that none came nigh me; 

For they were many that strove with 
me. 

20God shall hear, and humble them, 

Even He that is enthroned of old, 

Selah 

Such as have no changes, 

And fear not God. 

21He hath put forth his hands against 
them that were at peace with him; 

He hath profaned his covenant. 

22Smoother than cream were the 
speeches of his mouth, 

But his heart was war; 

His words were softer than oil, 

Yet were they keen-edged swords. 

 

23Cast thy burden upon the LORD, 
and He will sustain thee; 

He will never suffer the righteous to 
be moved. 

24But Thou, O God, wilt bring them 
down into the nethermost pit; 

Men of blood and deceit shall not 
live out half their days; 

But as for me, I will trust in Thee. 

 

For the Leader; upon Jonath-
elem-rehokim. [A Psalm] of 
David; Michtam; when the Philistines 
took him in Gath. 

 
56 




2Be gracious unto me, O God, for 
man would swallow me up; 

All the day he fighting oppresseth 
me. 

3They that lie in wait for me would 
swallow me up all the day; 

For they are many that fight against 
me, O Most High, 

4In the day that I am afraid, 

I will put my trust in Thee. 

5In God—I will praise His word— 

In God do I trust, I will not be 
afraid; 

What can flesh do unto me? 

 

6All the day they trouble mine 
affairs; 

All their thoughts are against me for 
evil. 

7They gather themselves together, 
they hide themselves, 

They mark my steps; 

According as they have waited for 
my soul. 

8Because of iniquity cast them out; 

In anger bring down the peoples, O 
God. 

9Thou has counted my wanderings; 

Put Thou my tears into Thy bottle; 

Are they not in Thy book? 

10Then shall mine enemies turn back 
in the day that I call; 

This I know, that God is for me. 

11In God—I will praise His word— 

In the LORD—I will praise His 
word— 

12In God do I trust, I will not be 
afraid; 

What can man do unto me? 

 

13Thy vows are upon me, O God; 

I will render thank-offerings unto 
Thee. 

14For thou hast delivered my soul 
from death; 

Hast Thou not delivered my feet 
from stumbling? 

That I may walk before God in the 
light of the living? 

 

For the Leader; Al-tashheth. 
[A Psalm] of David; Michtam; 
when he fled from Saul, in the cave. 

 

2Be gracious unto me, O God, be 
gracious unto me, 

For in Thee hath my soul taken 
refuge; 

Yea, in the shadow of Thy wings 
will I take refuge, 

Until calamities be overpast. 

3I will cry unto God Most high; 

Unto God that accomplisheth it for 
me. 

4He will send from heaven, and save 
me, 

When he that would swallow me up 
taunteth, Selah 

God shall send forth His mercy and 
His truth. 

5My soul is among lions, I do lie 
down among them that are 
aflame; 

Even the sons of men, whose teeth 
are spears and arrows, 

And their tongue a sharp sword. 

6Be Thou exalted, O God, above the 
heavens; 
57 




Thy glory be above all the earth. 

7They have prepared a net for my 
steps, 

My soul is bowed down; 

They have digged a pit before me, 

They are fallen into the midst 
thereof themselves. Selah 

8My heart is stedfast, O God, my 
heart is stedfast; 

I will sing, yea, I will sing praises. 

9Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery 
and harp; 

I will awake the dawn. 

10I will give thanks unto Thee, O 
Lord, among the peoples; 

I will sing praises unto Thee among 
the nations. 

11For Thy mercy is great unto the 
heavens, 

And Thy truth unto the skies. 

12Be Thou exalted, O God, above 
the heavens; 

Thy glory be above all the earth. 

 

For the Leader; Al-tashheth. 
[A Psalm] of David; Michtam. 

 

2Do ye indeed speak as a righteous 
company? 

Do ye judge with equity the sons of 
men? 

3Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; 

Ye weigh out in the earth the 
violence of your hands. 

4The wicked are estranged from the 
womb; 

The speakers of lies go astray as 
soon as they are born. 

5Their venom is like the venom of a 
serpent; 

They are like the deaf asp that 
stoppeth her ear; 

6Which hearkeneth not to the voice 
of charmers, 

Or of the most cunning binder of 
spells. 

 

7Break their teeth, O God, in their 
mouth; 

Break out the cheek-teeth of the 
young lions, O LORD. 

8Let them melt away as water that 
runneth apace; 

When he aimeth his arrows, let them 
be as though they were cut off. 

9Let them be as a snail which 
melteth and passeth away; 

Like the untimely births of a 
woman, that have not seen the 
sun. 

10Before your pots can feel the 
thorns, 

He will sweep it away with a 
whirlwind, the raw and the 
burning alike. 

 

11The righteous shall rejoice when 
he seeth the vengeance; 

He shall wash his feet in the blood 
of the wicked. 

12And men shall say: 'Verily there is 
a reward for the righteous; 

Verily there is a God that judgeth in 
the earth.' 

 

For the Leader; Al-tashheth. 
[A Psalm] of David; Michtam;

59 




when Saul sent, and they watched the 
house to kill him. 

 

2Deliver me from mine enemies, O 
my God; 

Set me on high from them that rise 
up against me. 

3Deliver me from the workers of 
iniquity, 

And save me from the men of blood. 

4For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; 

The impudent gather themselves 
together against me; 

Not for my transgression, nor for 
my sin, O LORD. 

5Without my fault, they run and 
prepare themselves; 

Awake Thou to help me, and 
behold. 

6Thou therefore, O LORD God of 
hosts, the God of Israel, 

Arouse Thyself to punish all the 
nations; 

Show no mercy to any iniquitous 
traitors. Selah 

 

7They return at evening, they howl 
like a dog, 

And go round about the city. 

8Behold, they belch out with their 
mouth; 

Swords are in their lips: 

'For who doth hear?' 

9But Thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at 
them; 

Thou shalt have all the nations in 
derision. 

10Because of his strength, I will wait 
for Thee; 

For God is my high tower. 

 

11The God of my mercy will come 
to meet me; 

God will let me gaze upon mine 
adversaries. 

12Slay them not, lest my people 
forget, 

Make them wander to and fro by 
Thy power, and bring them down, 

O Lord our shield. 

13For the sin of their mouth, and the 
words of their lips, 

Let them even be taken in their 
pride, 

And for cursing and lying which 
they speak. 

14Consume them in wrath, consume 
them, that they be no more; 

And let them know that God ruleth 
in Jacob, 

Unto the ends of the earth. Selah 

 

15And they return at evening, they 
howl like a dog, 

And go round about the city; 

16They wander up and down to 
devour, 

And tarry all night if they have not 
their fill. 

17But as for me, I will sing of Thy 
strength; 

Yea, I will sing aloud of Thy mercy 
in the morning; 

For Thou hast been my high tower, 

And a refuge in the day of my 
distress. 

18O my strength, unto Thee will I 
sing praises; 


For God is my high tower, the God 
of my mercy. 

 

For the Leader; upon Shushan 
Eduth; Michtam of David, to 
teach; 2when he strove with Aram-
naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and 
Joab returned, and smote of Edom in 
the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. 

 

3O God, Thou hast cast us off, Thou 
hast broken us down; 

Thou hast been angry; O restore us. 

4Thou hast made the land to shake, 
Thou hast cleft it; 

Heal the breaches thereof; for it 
tottereth. 

5Thou hast made Thy people to see 
hard things; 

Thou hast made us to drink the wine 
of staggering. 

6Thou hast given a banner to them 
that fear Thee, 

That it may be displayed because of 
the truth. Selah 

7That Thy beloved may be 
delivered, 

Save with Thy right hand, and 
answer me. 

 

8God spoke in His holiness, that I 
would exult; 

That I would divide Shechem, and 
mete out the valley of Succoth. 

9Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is 
mine; 

Ephraim also is the defence of my 
head; 

Judah is my sceptre. 

10Moab is my washpot; 

Upon Edom do I cast my shoe; 

Philistia, cry aloud because of me! 

 

11Who will bring me into the 
fortified city? 

Who will lead me unto Edom? 

12Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? 

And Thou goest not forth, O God, 
with our hosts. 

13Give us help against the adversary; 

For vain is the help of man. 

14Through God we shall do 
valiantly; 

For He it is that will tread down our 
adversaries. 

 

For the Leader; with string-
music. [A Psalm] of David. 

 

2Hear my cry, O God; 

Attend unto my prayer. 

3From the end of the earth will I call 
unto Thee, when my heart 
fainteth; 

Lead me to a rock that is too high 
for me. 

4For Thou hast been a refuge for me, 

A tower of strength in the face of 
the enemy. 

 

5I will dwell in Thy Tent for ever; 

I will take refuge in the covert of 
Thy wings. Selah 

6For Thou, O God, hast heard my 
vows; 

Thou hast granted the heritage of 
those that fear Thy name. 

 
60 

61 




7Mayest Thou add days unto the 
king's days! 

May his years be as many 
generations! 

8May he be enthroned before God 
for ever! 

Appoint mercy and truth, that they 
may preserve him. 

 

9So will I sing praise unto Thy name 
for ever, 

That I may daily perform my vows. 

 

For the Leader; for Jeduthun. 
A Psalm of David. 

 

2Only for God doth my soul wait in 
stillness; 

From Him cometh my salvation. 

3He only is my rock and my 
salvation, 

My high tower, I shall not be greatly 
moved. 

4How long will ye set upon a man, 

That ye may slay him, all of you, 

As a leaning wall, a tottering fence? 

5They only devise to thrust him 
down from his height, delighting 
in lies; 

They bless with their mouth, but 
they curse inwardly. Selah 

 

6Only for God wait thou in stillness, 
my soul; 

For from Him cometh my hope. 

7He only is my rock and my 
salvation, 

My high tower, I shall not be 
moved. 

8Upon God resteth my salvation and 
my glory; 

The rock of my strength, and my 
refuge, is in God. 

9Trust in Him at all times, ye 
people; 

Pour out your heart before Him; 

God is a refuge for us. Selah 

 

10Men of low degree are vanity, and 
men of high degree are a lie; 

If they be laid in the balances, they 
are together lighter than vanity. 

11Trust not in oppression, 

And put not vain hope in robbery; 

If riches increase, set not your heart 
thereon. 

12God hath spoken once, 

Twice have I heard this: 

That strength belongeth unto God; 

13Also unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth 
mercy; 

For Thou renderest to every man 
according to his work. 

 

A Psalm of David, when he 
was in the wilderness of 
Judah. 

 

2O God, Thou art my God, earnestly 
will I seek Thee; 

My soul thirsteth for Thee, my flesh 
longeth for Thee, 

In a dry and weary land, where no 
water is. 

3So have I looked for Thee in the 
sanctuary, 

To see Thy power and Thy glory.

63 




4For Thy lovingkindness is better 
than life; 

My lips shall praise Thee. 

5So will I bless Thee as long as I 
live; 

In Thy name will I lift up my hands. 

 

6My soul is satisfied as with marrow 
and fatness; 

And my mouth doth praise Thee 
with joyful lips; 

7When I remember Thee upon my 
couch, 

And meditate on Thee in the night-
watches. 

 

8For Thou hast been my help, 

And in the shadow of Thy wings do 
I rejoice. 

9My soul cleaveth unto Thee; 

Thy right hand holdeth me fast. 

 

10But those that seek my soul, to 
destroy it, 

Shall go into the nethermost parts of 
the earth. 

11They shall be hurled to the power 
of the sword; 

They shall be a portion for foxes. 

12But the king shall rejoice in God; 

Every one that sweareth by Him 
shall glory; 

For the mouth of them that speak 
lies shall be stopped. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

2Hear my voice, O God, in my 
complaint; 

Preserve my life from the terror of 
the enemy. 

3Hide me from the council of evil-
doers; 

From the tumult of the workers of 
iniquity; 

4Who have whet their tongue like a 
sword, 

And have aimed their arrow, a 
poisoned word; 

5That they may shoot in secret 
places at the blameless; 

Suddenly do they shoot at him, and 
fear not. 

6They encourage one another in an 
evil matter; 

They converse of laying snares 
secretly; 

They ask, who would see them. 

7They search out iniquities, they 
have accomplished a diligent 
search; 

Even in the inward thought of every 
one, and the deep heart. 

 

8But God doth shoot at them with an 
arrow suddenly; 

Thence are their wounds. 

9So they make their own tongue a 
stumbling unto themselves; 

All that see them shake the head. 

10And all men fear; 

And they declare the work of God, 

And understand His doing. 

11The righteous shall be glad in the 
LORD, and shall take refuge in 
Him; 
64 




And all the upright in heart shall 
glory. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm. 

A Song of David. 

 

2Praise waiteth for Thee, O God, in 
Zion; 

And unto Thee the vow is 
performed. 

3O Thou that hearest prayer, 

Unto Thee doth all flesh come. 

4The tale of iniquities is too heavy 
for me; 

As for our transgressions, Thou wilt 
pardon them. 

5Happy is the man whom Thou 
choosest, and bringest near, 

That he may dwell in Thy courts; 

May we be satisfied with the 
goodness of Thy house, 

The holy place of Thy temple! 

 

6With wondrous works dost Thou 
answer us in righteousness, 

O God of our salvation; 

Thou the confidence of all the ends 
of the earth, 

And of the far distant seas; 

7Who by Thy strength settest fast 
the mountains, 

Who art girded about with might; 

8Who stillest the roaring of the seas, 
the roaring of their waves, 

And the tumult of the peoples; 

9So that they that dwell in the 
uttermost parts stand in awe of 
Thy signs; 

Thou makest the outgoings of the 
morning and evening to rejoice. 

 

10Thou hast remembered the earth, 
and watered her, greatly enriching 
her, 

With the river of God that is full of 
water; 

Thou preparest them corn, for so 
preparest Thou her. 

11Watering her ridges abundantly, 

Settling down the furrows thereof, 

Thou makest her soft with showers; 

Thou blessest the growth thereof. 

12Thou crownest the year with Thy 
goodness; 

And Thy paths drop fatness. 

13The pastures of the wilderness do 
drop; 

And the hills are girded with joy. 

14The meadows are clothed with 
flocks; 

The valleys also are covered over 
with corn; 

They shout for joy, yea, they sing. 

 

For the Leader. A Song, a 
Psalm. 

 

Shout unto God, all the earth; 

2Sing praises unto the glory of His 
name; 

Make His praise glorious. 

3Say unto God: 'How tremendous is 
Thy work! 

Through the greatness of Thy power 
shall Thine enemies dwindle 
away before Thee. 

4All the earth shall worship Thee, 
65 

66 




And shall sing praises unto Thee; 

They shall sing praises to Thy 
name.' Selah 

 

5Come, and see the works of God; 

He is terrible in His doing toward 
the children of men. 

6He turned the sea into dry land; 

They went through the river on foot; 

There let us rejoice in Him! 

7Who ruleth by His might for ever; 

His eyes keep watch upon the 
nations; 

Let not the rebellious exalt 
themselves. Selah 

 

8Bless our God, ye peoples, 

And make the voice of His praise to 
be heard; 

9Who hath set our soul in life, 

And suffered not our foot to be 
moved, 

10For Thou, O God, hast tried us; 

Thou hast refined us, as silver is 
refined. 

11Thou didst bring us into the hold; 

Thou didst lay constraint upon our 
loins. 

12Thou hast caused men to ride over 
our heads; 

We went through fire and through 
water; 

But Thou didst bring us out unto 
abundance. 

 

13I will come into Thy house with 
burnt-offerings, 

I will perform unto Thee my vows, 

14Which my lips have uttered, 

And my mouth hath spoken, when I 
was in distress. 

15I will offer unto Thee burnt-
offerings of fatlings, 

With the sweet smoke of rams; 

I will offer bullocks with goats. 

Selah 

16Come, and hearken, all ye that fear 
God, 

And I will declare what He hath 
done for my soul. 

17I cried unto Him with my mouth, 

And He was extolled with my 
tongue. 

18If I had regarded iniquity in my 
heart, 

The Lord would not hear; 

19But verily God hath heard; 

He hath attended to the voice of my 
prayer. 

20Blessed be God, 

Who hath not turned away my 
prayer, nor His mercy from me. 

 

For the Leader; with string-
music. A Psalm, a Song. 

 

2God be gracious unto us, and bless 
us; 

May He cause His face to shine 
toward us; Selah 

3That Thy way may be known upon 
earth, 

Thy salvation among all nations. 

 

4Let the peoples give thanks unto 
Thee, O God; 

Let the peoples give thanks unto 
Thee, all of them. 
67 




5O let the nations be glad and sing 
for joy; 

For Thou wilt judge the peoples 
with equity, 

And lead the nations upon earth. 

Selah 

 

6Let the peoples give thanks unto 
Thee, O God; 

Let the peoples give thanks unto 
Thee, all of them. 

7The earth hath yielded her increase; 

May God, our own God, bless us. 

8May God bless us; 

And let all the ends of the earth fear 
Him. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David, a Song. 

 

2Let God arise, let His enemies be 
scattered; 

And let them that hate Him flee 
before Him. 

3As smoke is driven away, so drive 
them away; 

As wax melteth before the fire, 

So let the wicked perish at the 
presence of God. 

4But let the righteous be glad, let 
them exult before God; 

Yea, let them rejoice with gladness. 

 

5Sing unto God, sing praises to His 
name; 

Extol Him that rideth upon the 
skies, whose name is the LORD; 

And exult ye before Him. 

6A father of the fatherless, and a 
judge of the widows, 

Is God in His holy habitation. 

7God maketh the solitary to dwell in 
a house; 

He bringeth out the prisoners into 
prosperity; 

The rebellious dwell but in a 
parched land. 

8O God, when Thou wentest forth 
before Thy people, 

When Thou didst march through the 
wilderness; Selah 

9The earth trembled, the heavens 
also dropped at the presence of 
God; 

Even yon Sinai trembled at the 
presence of God, the God of 
Israel. 

10A bounteous rain didst Thou pour 
down, O God; 

When Thine inheritance was weary, 
Thou didst confirm it. 

11Thy flock settled therein; 

Thou didst prepare in Thy goodness 
for the poor, O God. 

 

12The Lord giveth the word; 

The women that proclaim the 
tidings are a great host. 

13Kings of armies flee, they flee; 

And she that tarrieth at home 
divideth the spoil. 

14When ye lie among the sheepfolds, 

The wings of the dove are covered 
with silver, 

And her pinions with the shimmer 
of gold. 
68 




15When the Almighty scattereth 
kings therein, 

It snoweth in Zalmon. 

 

16A mountain of God is the 
mountain of Bashan; 

A mountain of peaks is the 
mountain of Bashan. 

17Why look ye askance, ye 
mountains of peaks, 

At the mountain which God hath 
desired for His abode? 

Yea, the LORD will dwell therein for 
ever. 

18The chariots of God are myriads, 
even thousands upon thousands; 

The Lord is among them, as in 
Sinai, in holiness. 

19Thou hast ascended on high, Thou 
hast led captivity captive; 

Thou hast received gifts among 
men, 

Yea, among the rebellious also, that 
the LORD God might dwell there. 

20Blessed be the Lord, day by day 
He beareth our burden, 

Even the God who is our salvation. 

Selah 

21God is unto us a God of 
deliverances; 

And unto GOD the Lord belong the 
issues of death. 

22Surely God will smite through the 
head of His enemies, 

The hairy scalp of him that goeth 
about in his guiltiness. 

23The Lord said: 'I will bring back 
from Bashan, 

I will bring them back from the 
depths of the sea; 

24That thy foot may wade through 
blood, 

That the tongue of thy dogs may 
have its portion from thine 
enemies.' 

 

25They see Thy goings, O God, 

Even the goings of my God, my 
King, in holiness. 

26The singers go before, the 
minstrels follow after, 

In the midst of damsels playing 
upon timbrels. 

27'Bless ye God in full assemblies, 

Even the Lord, ye that are from the 
fountain of Israel.' 

28There is Benjamin, the youngest, 
ruling them, 

The princes of Judah their council, 

The princes of Zebulun, the princes 
of Naphtali. 

29Thy God hath commanded thy 
strength; 

Be strong, O God, Thou that hast 
wrought for us 

30Out of Thy temple at Jerusalem, 

Whither kings shall bring presents 
unto Thee. 

31Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, 

The multitude of the bulls, with the 
calves of the peoples, 

Every one submitting himself with 
pieces of silver; 

He hath scattered the peoples that 
delight in war! 

32Nobles shall come out of Egypt; 


Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out 
her hands unto God. 

 

33Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the 
earth; 

O sing praises unto the Lord; 

Selah 

34To Him that rideth upon the 
heavens of heavens, which are of 
old; 

Lo, He uttereth His voice, a mighty 
voice. 

35Ascribe ye strength unto God; 

His majesty is over Israel, 

And His strength is in the skies. 

36Awful is God out of thy holy 
places; 

The God of Israel, He giveth 
strength and power unto the 
people; 

Blessed be God. 

 

For the Leader; upon 
Shoshannim. [A Psalm] of 
David. 

 

2Save me, O God; 

For the waters are come in even 
unto the soul. 

3I am sunk in deep mire, where there 
is no standing; 

I am come into deep waters, and the 
flood overwhelmeth me. 

4I am weary of my crying; my throat 
is dried; 

Mine eyes fail while I wait for my 
God. 

5They that hate me without a cause 
are more than the hairs of my 
head; 

They that would cut me off, being 
mine enemies wrongfully, are 
many; 

Should I restore that which I took 
not away? 

6O God, Thou knowest my folly; 

And my trespasses are not hid from 
Thee. 

7Let not them that wait for Thee be 
ashamed through me, O Lord GOD 
of hosts; 

Let not those that seek Thee be 
brought to confusion through me, 
O God of Israel. 

 

8Because for Thy sake I have borne 
reproach; 

Confusion hath covered my face. 

9I am become a stranger unto my 
brethren, 

And an alien unto my mother's 
children. 

10Because zeal for Thy house hath 
eaten me up, 

And the reproaches of them that 
reproach Thee are fallen upon me. 

11And I wept with my soul with 
fasting, 

And that became unto me a 
reproach. 

12I made sackcloth also my garment, 

And I became a byword unto them. 

13They that sit in the gate talk of me; 

And I am the song of the drunkards. 

 
69 




14But as for me, let my prayer be 
unto Thee, O LORD, in an 
acceptable time; 

O God, in the abundance of Thy 
mercy, 

Answer me with the truth of Thy 
salvation. 

15Deliver me out of the mire, and let 
me not sink; 

Let me be delivered from them that 
hate me, and out of the deep 
waters. 

16Let not the waterflood overwhelm 
me, 

Neither let the deep swallow me up; 

And let not the pit shut her mouth 
upon me. 

17Answer me, O LORD, for Thy 
mercy is good; 

According to the multitude of Thy 
compassions turn Thou unto me. 

18And hide not Thy face from Thy 
servant; 

For I am in distress; answer me 
speedily. 

19Draw nigh unto my soul, and 
redeem it; 

Ransom me because of mine 
enemies. 

 

20Thou knowest my reproach, and 
my shame, and my confusion; 

Mine adversaries are all before 
Thee. 

21Reproach hath broken my heart; 
and I am sore sick; 

And I looked for some to show 
compassion, but there was none; 

And for comforters, but I found 
none. 

22Yea, they put poison into my food; 

And in my thirst they gave me 
vinegar to drink. 

 

23Let their table before them become 
a snare; 

And when they are in peace, let it 
become a trap. 

24Let their eyes be darkened, that 
they see not; 

And make their loins continually to 
totter. 

25Pour out Thine indignation upon 
them, 

And let the fierceness of Thine 
anger overtake them. 

26Let their encampment be desolate; 

Let none dwell in their tents. 

27For they persecute him whom 
Thou hast smitten; 

And they tell of the pain of those 
whom Thou hast wounded. 

28Add iniquity unto their iniquity; 

And let them not come into Thy 
righteousness. 

29Let them be blotted out of the 
book of the living, 

And not be written with the 
righteous. 

30But I am afflicted and in pain; 

Let Thy salvation, O God, set me up 
on high. 

31I will praise the name of God with 
a song, 

And will magnify Him with 
thanksgiving. 


32And it shall please the LORD better 
than a bullock 

That hath horns and hoofs. 

33The humble shall see it, and be 
glad; 

Ye that seek after God, let your 
heart revive. 

34For the LORD hearkeneth unto the 
needy, 

And despiseth not His prisoners. 

35Let heaven and earth praise Him, 

The seas, and every thing that 
moveth therein. 

36For God will save Zion, and build 
the cities of Judah; 

And they shall abide there, and have 
it in possession. 

37The seed also of His servants shall 
inherit it; 

And they that love His name shall 
dwell therein. 

 

For the Leader. [A Psalm] of 
David; to make memorial. 

 

O God, to deliver me, 

O LORD, to help me, make haste. 

2Let them be ashamed and abashed 

That seek after my soul; 

Let them be turned backward and 
brought to confusion 

That delight in my hurt. 

3Let them be turned back by reason 
of their shame 

That say: 'Aha, aha.' 

4Let all those that seek Thee rejoice 
and be glad in Thee; 

And let such as love Thy salvation 
say continually: 

'Let God be magnified.' 

5But I am poor and needy; 

O God, make haste unto me; 

Thou art my help and my deliverer; 

O LORD, tarry not. 

 

In Thee, O LORD, have I taken 
refuge; 

Let me never be ashamed. 

2Deliver me in Thy righteousness, 
and rescue me; 

Incline Thine ear unto me, and save 
me. 

3Be Thou to me a sheltering rock, 
whereunto I may continually 
resort, 

Which Thou hast appointed to save 
me; 

For Thou art my rock and my 
fortress. 

 

4O my God, rescue me out of the 
hand of the wicked, 

Out of the grasp of the unrighteous 
and ruthless man. 

5For Thou art my hope; 

O Lord GOD, my trust from my 
youth. 

6Upon Thee have I stayed myself 
from birth; 

Thou art he that took me out of my 
mother's womb; 

My praise is continually of Thee. 

7I am as a wonder unto many; 

But Thou art my strong refuge. 

8My mouth shall be filled with Thy 
praise, 

And with Thy glory all the day. 
70 

71 




9Cast me not off in the time of old 
age; 

When my strength faileth, forsake 
me not. 

10For mine enemies speak 
concerning me, 

And they that watch for my soul 
take counsel together, 

11Saying: 'God hath forsaken him; 

Pursue and take him; for there is 
none to deliver.' 

12O God, be not far from me; 

O my God, make haste to help me. 

13Let them be ashamed and 
consumed that are adversaries to 
my soul; 

Let them be covered with reproach 
and confusion that seek my hurt. 

 

14But as for me, I will hope 
continually, 

And will praise Thee yet more and 
more. 

15My mouth shall tell of Thy 
righteousness, 

And of Thy salvation all the day; 

For I know not the numbers thereof. 

16I will come with Thy mighty acts, 
O Lord GOD; 

I will make mention of Thy 
righteousness, even of Thine 
only. 

17O God, Thou hast taught me from 
my youth; 

And until now do I declare Thy 
wondrous works. 

18And even unto old age and hoary 
hairs, O God, forsake me not; 

Until I have declared Thy strength 
unto the next generation, 

Thy might to every one that is to 
come. 

19Thy righteousness also, O God, 
which reacheth unto high heaven; 

Thou who hast done great things, 

O God, who is like unto Thee? 

20Thou, who hast made me to see 
many and sore troubles, 

Wilt quicken me again, and bring 
me up again from the depths of 
the earth. 

21Thou wilt increase my greatness, 

And turn and comfort me. 

22I also will give thanks unto Thee 
with the psaltery, 

Even unto Thy truth, O my God; 

I will sing praises unto Thee with 
the harp, 

O Thou Holy One of Israel. 

23My lips shall greatly rejoice when 
I sing praises unto Thee; 

And my soul, which Thou hast 
redeemed. 

24My tongue also shall tell of Thy 
righteousness all the day; 

For they are ashamed, for they are 
abashed, that seek my hurt. 

 

[A Psalm] of Solomon. 

 

Give the king Thy judgments, O 
God, 

And Thy righteousness unto the 
king's son; 

2That he may judge Thy people with 
righteousness, 

And Thy poor with justice. 
72 




3Let the mountains bear peace to the 
people, 

And the hills, through righteousness. 

4May he judge the poor of the 
people, 

And save the children of the needy, 

And crush the oppressor. 

5They shall fear Thee while the sun 
endureth, 

And so long as the moon, 
throughout all generations. 

6May he come down like rain upon 
the mown grass, 

As showers that water the earth. 

7In his days let the righteous 
flourish, 

And abundance of peace, till the 
moon be no more. 

 

8May he have dominion also from 
sea to sea, 

And from the River unto the ends of 
the earth. 

9Let them that dwell in the 
wilderness bow before him; 

And his enemies lick the dust. 

10The kings of Tarshish and of the 
isles shall render tribute; 

The kings of Sheba and Seba shall 
offer gifts. 

11Yea, all kings shall prostrate 
themselves before him; 

All nations shall serve him. 

12For he will deliver the needy when 
he crieth; the poor also, and him 
that hath no helper. 

13He will have pity on the poor and 
needy, 

And the souls of the needy he will 
save. 

14He will redeem their soul from 
oppression and violence, 

And precious will their blood be in 
his sight. 

15That they may live, and that he 
may give them of the gold of 
Sheba, 

That they may pray for him 
continually, 

Yea, bless him all the day. 

16May he be as a rich cornfield in 
the land upon the top of the 
mountains; 

May his fruit rustle like Lebanon; 

And may they blossom out of the 
city like grass of the earth. 

17May his name endure for ever; 

May his name be continued as long 
as the sun; 

May men also bless themselves by 
him; 

May all nations call him happy. 

 

18Blessed be the LORD God, the God 
of Israel, 

Who only doeth wondrous things; 

19And blessed be His glorious name 
for ever; 

And let the whole earth be filled 
with His glory. 

Amen, and Amen. 

 

20The prayers of David the son of 
Jesse are ended. 

 

 
 

A Psalm of Asaph. 

 

Surely God is good to Israel, 

Even to such as are pure in heart. 

2But as for me, my feet were almost 
gone; 

My steps had well nigh slipped. 

3For I was envious at the arrogant, 

When I saw the prosperity of the 
wicked. 

4For there are no pangs at their 
death, 

And their body is sound. 

5In the trouble of man they are not; 

Neither are they plagued like men. 

6Therefore pride is as a chain about 
their neck; 

Violence covereth them as a 
garment. 

7Their eyes stand forth from fatness; 

They are gone beyond the 
imaginations of their heart. 

8They scoff, and in wickedness utter 
oppression; 

They speak as if there were none on 
high. 

9They have set their mouth against 
the heavens, 

And their tongue walketh through 
the earth. 

10Therefore His people return hither; 

And waters of fullness are drained 
out by them. 

11And they say: 'How doth God 
know? 

And is there knowledge in the Most 
High?' 

12Behold, such are the wicked; 

And they that are always at ease 
increase riches. 

13Surely in vain have I cleansed my 
heart, 

And washed my hands in 
innocency; 

14For all the day have I been 
plagued, 

And my chastisement came every 
morning. 

 

15If I had said: 'I will speak thus', 

Behold, I had been faithless to the 
generation of Thy children. 

16And when I pondered how I might 
know this, 

It was wearisome in mine eyes; 

17Until I entered into the sanctuary 
of God, 

And considered their end. 

18Surely Thou settest them in 
slippery places; 

Thou hurlest them down to utter 
ruin. 

19How are they become a desolation 
in a moment! 

They are wholly consumed by 
terrors. 

20As a dream when one awaketh, 

So, O Lord, when Thou arousest 
Thyself, Thou wilt despise their 
semblance. 

21For my heart was in a ferment, 

And I was pricked in my reins. 
73 




22But I was brutish, and ignorant; 

I was as a beast before Thee. 

 

23Nevertheless I am continually with 
Thee; 

Thou holdest my right hand. 

24Thou wilt guide me with Thy 
counsel, 

And afterward receive me with 
glory. 

25Whom have I in heaven but Thee? 

And beside Thee I desire none upon 
earth. 

26My flesh and my heart faileth; 

But God is the rock of my heart and 
my portion for ever. 

27For, lo, they that go far from Thee 
shall perish; 

Thou dost destroy all them that go 
astray from Thee. 

28But as for me, the nearness of God 
is my good; 

I have made the Lord GOD my 
refuge, 

That I may tell of all Thy works. 

 

Maschil of Asaph. 

 

Why, O God, hast Thou cast us off 
for ever? 

Why doth Thine anger smoke 
against the flock of Thy pasture? 

2Remember Thy congregation, 
which Thou hast gotten of old, 

Which Thou hast redeemed to be the 
tribe of Thine inheritance; 

And mount Zion, wherein Thou hast 
dwelt. 

3Lift up Thy steps because of the 
perpetual ruins, 

Even all the evil that the enemy hath 
done in the sanctuary. 

4Thine adversaries have roared in 
the midst of Thy meeting-place; 

They have set up their own signs for 
signs. 

5It seemed as when men wield 
upwards 

Axes in a thicket of trees. 

6And now all the carved work 
thereof together 

They strike down with hatchet and 
hammers. 

7They have set Thy sanctuary on 
fire; 

They have profaned the dwelling-
place of Thy name even to the 
ground. 

8They said in their heart: 'Let us 
make havoc of them altogether'; 

They have burned up all the 
meeting-places of God in the 
land. 

9We see not our signs; 

There is no more any prophet; 

Neither is there among us any that 
knoweth how long. 

10How long, O God, shall the 
adversary reproach? 

Shall the enemy blaspheme Thy 
name for ever? 

11Why withdrawest Thou Thy hand, 
even Thy right hand? 

Draw it out of Thy bosom and 
consume them. 

 

12Yet God is my King of old, 
74 




Working salvation in the midst of 
the earth. 

13Thou didst break the sea in pieces 
by Thy strength; 

Thou didst shatter the heads of the 
sea-monsters in the waters. 

14Thou didst crush the heads of 
leviathan, 

Thou gavest him to be food to the 
folk inhabiting the wilderness. 

15Thou didst cleave fountain and 
brook; 

Thou driedst up ever-flowing rivers. 

16Thine is the day, Thine also the 
night; 

Thou hast established luminary and 
sun. 

17Thou hast set all the borders of the 
earth; 

Thou hast made summer and winter. 

 

18Remember this, how the enemy 
hath reproached the LORD, 

And how a base people have 
blasphemed Thy name. 

19O deliver not the soul of Thy 
turtle-dove unto the wild beast; 

Forget not the life of Thy poor for 
ever. 

20Look upon the covenant; 

For the dark places of the land are 
full of the habitations of violence. 

21O let not the oppressed turn back 
in confusion; 

Let the poor and needy praise Thy 
name. 

22Arise, O God, plead Thine own 
cause; 

Remember Thy reproach all the day 
at the hand of the base man. 

23Forget not the voice of Thine 
adversaries, 

The tumult of those that rise up 
against Thee which ascendeth 
continually. 

 

For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A 
Psalm of Asaph, a Song. 

 

2We give thanks unto Thee, O God, 

We give thanks, and Thy name is 
near; 

Men tell of Thy wondrous works. 

3'When I take the appointed time, 

I Myself will judge with equity. 

4When the earth and all the 
inhabitants thereof are dissolved, 

I Myself establish the pillars of it.' 

Selah 

 

5I say unto the arrogant 'Deal not 
arrogantly'; 

And to the wicked 'Lift not up the 
horn.' 

6Lift not up your horn on high; 

Speak not insolence with a haughty 
neck. 

7For neither from the east, nor from 
the west, 

Nor yet from the wilderness, cometh 
lifting up. 

8For God is judge; 

He putteth down one, and lifteth up 
another. 

9For in the hand of the LORD there is 
a cup, with foaming wine, full of 
mixture, 
75 




And He poureth out of the same; 

Surely the dregs thereof, all the 
wicked of the earth shall drain 
them, and drink them. 

 

10But as for me, I will declare for 
ever, 

I will sing praises to the God of 
Jacob. 

11All the horns of the wicked also 
will I cut off; 

But the horns of the righteous shall 
be lifted up. 

 

For the Leader; with string-
music. A Psalm of Asaph, a 
Song. 

 

2In Judah is God known; 

His name is great in Israel. 

3In Salem also is set His tabernacle, 

And His dwelling-place in Zion. 

4There He broke the fiery shafts of 
the bow; 

The shield, and the sword, and the 
battle. Selah 

 

5Glorious art Thou and excellent, 
coming down from the mountains 
of prey. 

6The stout-hearted are bereft of 
sense, they sleep their sleep; 

And none of the men of might have 
found their hands. 

7At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, 

They are cast into a dead sleep, the 
riders also and the horses. 

 

8Thou, even Thou, art terrible; 

And who may stand in Thy sight 
when once Thou art angry? 

9Thou didst cause sentence to be 
heard from heaven; 

The earth feared, and was still, 

10When God arose to judgment, 

To save all the humble of the earth. 

Selah 

 

11Surely the wrath of man shall 
praise Thee; 

The residue of wrath shalt Thou gird 
upon Thee. 

12Vow, and pay unto the LORD your 
God; 

Let all that are round about Him 
bring presents unto Him that is to 
be feared; 

13He minisheth the spirit of princes; 

He is terrible to the kings of the 
earth. 

 

For the Leader; for Jeduthun. 
A Psalm of Asaph. 

 

2I will lift up my voice unto God, an 
cry; 

I will lift up my voice unto God, 
that He may give ear unto me. 

3In the day of my trouble I seek the 
Lord; 

With my hand uplifted, [mine eye] 
streameth in the night without 
ceasing; 

My soul refuseth to be comforted. 

4When I think thereon, O God, I 
must moan; 

When I muse thereon, my spirit 
fainteth. Selah 
76 

77 




5Thou holdest fast the lids of mine 
eyes; 

I am troubled, and cannot speak. 

6I have pondered the days of old, the 
years of ancient times. 

7In the night I will call to 
remembrance my song; 

I will commune with mine own 
heart; 

And my spirit maketh diligent 
search 

8'Will the Lord cast off for ever? 

And will He be favourable no more? 

9Is His mercy clean gone for ever? 

Is His promise come to an end for 
evermore? 

10Hath God forgotten to be 
gracious? 

Hath He in anger shut up his 
compassions?' Selah 

11And I say 'This is my weakness, 

That the right hand of the Most 
High could change. 

12I will make mention of the deeds 
of the LORD; 

Yea, I will remember Thy wonders 
of old. 

13I will meditate also upon all Thy 
work, 

And muse on Thy doings.' 

14O God, Thy way is in holiness; 

Who is a great god like unto God? 

15Thou art the God that doest 
wonders; 

Thou hast made known Thy strength 
among the peoples. 

16Thou hast with Thine arm 
redeemed Thy people, 

The sons of Jacob and Joseph. 

Selah 

17The waters saw Thee, O God; 

The waters saw Thee, they were in 
pain; 

The depths also trembled. 

18The clouds flooded forth waters; 

The skies sent out a sound; 

Thine arrows also went abroad. 

19The voice of Thy thunder was in 
the whirlwind; 

The lightnings lighted up the world; 

The earth trembled and shook. 

20Thy way was in the sea, 

And Thy path in the great waters, 

And Thy footsteps were not known. 

21Thou didst lead Thy people like a 
flock, 

By the hand of Moses and Aaron. 

 

Maschil of Asaph. 

 

Give ear, O my people, to my 
teaching; 

Incline your ears to the words of my 
mouth. 

2I will open my mouth with a 
parable; 

I will utter dark sayings concerning 
days of old; 

3That which we have heard and 
known, 

And our fathers have told us, 

4We will not hide from their 
children, 

Telling to the generation to come 
the praises of the LORD, 

And His strength, and His wondrous 
works that He hath done. 

 
78 




5For He established a testimony in 
Jacob, 

And appointed a law in Israel, 

Which He commanded our fathers, 

That they should make them known 
to their children; 

6That the generation to come might 
know them, even the children that 
should be born; 

Who should arise and tell them to 
their children, 

7That they might put their 
confidence in God, 

And not forget the works of God, 

But keep His commandments; 

8And might not be as their fathers, 

A stubborn and rebellious 
generation; 

A generation that set not their heart 
aright, 

And whose spirit was not stedfast 
with God. 

 

9The children of Ephraim were as 
archers handling the bow, 

That turned back in the day of 
battle. 

10They kept not the covenant of 
God, 

And refused to walk in His law; 

11And they forgot His doings, 

And His wondrous works that He 
had shown them. 

12Marvellous things did He in the 
sight of their fathers, 

In the land of Egypt, in the field of 
Zoan. 

13He cleaved the sea, and caused 
them to pass through; 

And He made the waters to stand as 
a heap. 

14By day also He led them with a 
cloud, 

And all the night with a light of fire. 

15He cleaved rocks in the 
wilderness, 

And gave them drink abundantly as 
out of the great deep. 

16He brought streams also out of the 
rock, 

And caused waters to run down like 
rivers. 

 

17Yet went they on still to sin 
against Him, 

To rebel against the Most High in 
the desert. 

18And they tried God in their heart 

By asking food for their craving. 

19Yea, they spoke against God; 

They said 'Can God prepare a table 
in the wilderness? 

20Behold, He smote the rock, that 
waters gushed out, 

And streams overflowed; 

Can He give bread also? 

Or will He provide flesh for His 
people?' 

21Therefore the LORD heard, and was 
wroth; 

And a fire was kindled against 
Jacob, 

And anger also went up against 
Israel; 

22Because they believed not in God, 

And trusted not in His salvation. 

23And He commanded the skies 
above, 


And opened the doors of heaven; 

24And He caused manna to rain 
upon them for food, 

And gave them of the corn of 
heaven. 

25Man did eat the bread of the 
mighty; 

He sent them provisions to the full. 

26He caused the east wind to set 
forth in heaven; 

And by His power He brought on 
the south wind. 

27He caused flesh also to rain upon 
them as the dust, 

And winged fowl as the sand of the 
seas; 

28And He let it fall in the midst of 
their camp, 

Round about their dwellings. 

29So they did eat, and were well 
filled; 

And He gave them that which they 
craved. 

30They were not estranged from 
their craving, 

Their food was yet in their mouths, 

31When the anger of God went up 
against them, 

And slew of the lustieth among 
them, 

And smote down the young men of 
Israel. 

 

32For all this they sinned still, 

And believed not in His wondrous 
works. 

33Therefore He ended their days as a 
breath, 

And their years in terror. 

34When He slew them, then they 
would inquire after Him, 

And turn back and seek God 
earnestly. 

35And they remembered that God 
was their Rock, 

And the Most High God their 
redeemer. 

36But they beguiled Him with their 
mouth, 

And lied unto Him with their 
tongue. 

37For their heart was not stedfast 
with Him, 

Neither were they faithful in His 
covenant. 

38But He, being full of compassion, 
forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth 
not; 

Yea, many a time doth He turn His 
anger away, 

And doth not stir up all His wrath. 

39So He remembered that they were 
but flesh, 

A wind that passeth away, and 
cometh not again. 

 

40How oft did they rebel against 
Him in the wilderness, 

And grieve Him in the desert! 

41And still again they tried God, 

And set bounds to the Holy One of 
Israel. 

42They remembered not His hand, 

Nor the day when He redeemed 
them from the adversary. 

43How He set His signs in Egypt, 

And His wonders in the field of 
Zoan; 


44And turned their rivers into blood, 

So that they could not drink their 
streams. 

45He sent among them swarms of 
flies, which devoured them; 

And frogs, which destroyed them. 

46He gave also their increase unto 
the caterpillar, 

And their labour unto the locust. 

47He destroyed their vines with hail, 

And their sycamore-trees with frost. 

48He gave over their cattle also to 
the hail, 

And their flocks to fiery bolts. 

49He sent forth upon them the 
fierceness of His anger, 

Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, 

A sending of messengers of evil. 

50He levelled a path for His anger; 

He spared not their soul from death, 

But gave their life over to the 
pestilence; 

51And smote all the first-born in 
Egypt, 

The first-fruits of their strength in 
the tents of Ham; 

52But He made His own people to go 
forth like sheep, 

And guided them in the wilderness 
like a flock. 

53And He led them safely, and they 
feared not; 

But the sea overwhelmed their 
enemies. 

54And He brought them to His holy 
border, 

To the mountain, which His right 
hand had gotten. 

55He drove out the nations also 
before them, 

And allotted them for an inheritance 
by line, 

And made the tribes of Israel to 
dwell in their tents. 

 

56Yet they tried and provoked God, 
the Most High, 

And kept not His testimonies; 

57But turned back, and dealt 
treacherously like their fathers; 

They were turned aside like a 
deceitful bow. 

58For they provoked Him with their 
high places, 

And moved Him to jealousy with 
their graven images. 

59God heard, and was wroth, 

And He greatly abhorred Israel; 

60And He forsook the tabernacle of 
Shiloh, 

The tent which He had made to 
dwell among men; 

61And delivered His strength into 
captivity, 

And His glory into the adversary's 
hand. 

62He gave His people over also unto 
the sword; 

And was wroth with His inheritance. 

63Fire devoured their young men; 

And their virgins had no marriage-
song. 

64Their priests fell by the sword; 

And their widows made no 
lamentation. 

 


65Then the Lord awaked as one 
asleep, 

Like a mighty man recovering from 
wine. 

66And He smote His adversaries 
backward; 

He put upon them a perpetual 
reproach. 

67Moreover He abhorred the tent of 
Joseph, 

And chose not the tribe of Ephraim; 

68But chose the tribe of Judah, 

The mount Zion which He loved. 

69And He built His sanctuary like 
the heights, 

Like the earth which He hath 
founded for ever. 

70He chose David also His servant, 

And took him from the sheepfolds; 

71From following the ewes that give 
suck He brought him, 

To be shepherd over Jacob His 
people, and Israel His inheritance. 

72So he shepherded them according 
to the integrity of his heart; 

And lead them by the skilfulness of 
his hands. 

 

A Psalm of Asaph. 

 

O God, the heathen are come into 
Thine inheritance; 

They have defiled Thy holy temple; 

They have made Jerusalem into 
heaps. 

2They have given the dead bodies of 
Thy servants to be food unto the 
fowls of the heaven, 

The flesh of Thy saints unto the 
beasts of the earth. 

3They have shed their blood like 
water 

Round about Jerusalem, with none 
to bury them. 

4We are become a taunt to our 
neighbours, 

A scorn and derision to them that 
are round about us. 

 

5How long, O LORD, wilt Thou be 
angry for ever? 

How long will Thy jealousy burn 
like fire? 

6Pour out Thy wrath upon the 
nations that know Thee not, 

And upon the kingdoms that call not 
upon Thy name. 

7For they have devoured Jacob, 

And laid waste his habitation. 

8Remember not against us the 
iniquities of our forefathers; 

Let Thy compassions speedily come 
to meet us; 

For we are brought very low. 

 

9Help us, O God of our salvation, 
for the sake of the glory of Thy 
name; 

And deliver us, and forgive our sins, 
for Thy name's sake. 

10Wherefore should the nations say: 
'Where is their God?' 

Let the avenging of Thy servants' 
blood that is shed 

Be made known among the nations 
in our sight. 
79 




11Let the groaning of the prisoner 
come before Thee; 

According to the greatness of Thy 
power set free those that are 
appointed to death; 

12And render unto our neighbours 
sevenfold into their bosom 

Their reproach, wherewith they 
have reproached Thee, O Lord. 

13So we that are Thy people and the 
flock of Thy pasture 

Will give Thee thanks for ever; 

We will tell of Thy praise to all 
generations. 

 

For the Leader; upon 
Shoshannim. A testimony. A 
Psalm of Asaph. 

 

2Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, 

Thou that leadest Joseph like a 
flock; 

Thou that art enthroned upon the 
cherubim, shine forth. 

3Before Ephraim and Benjamin and 
Manasseh, stir up Thy might, 

And come to save us. 

4O God, restore us; 

And cause Thy face to shine, and we 
shall be saved. 

 

5O LORD God of hosts, 

How long wilt Thou be angry 
against the prayer of Thy people? 

6Thou hast fed them with the bread 
of tears, 

And given them tears to drink in 
large measure. 

7Thou makest us a strife unto our 
neighbours; 

And our enemies mock as they 
please. 

8O God of hosts, restore us; 

And cause Thy face to shine, and we 
shall be saved. 

 

9Thou didst pluck up a vine out of 
Egypt; 

Thou didst drive out the nations, and 
didst plant it. 

10Thou didst clear a place before it, 

And it took deep root, and filled the 
land. 

11The mountains were covered with 
the shadow of it, 

And the mighty cedars with the 
boughs thereof. 

12She sent out her branches unto the 
sea, 

And her shoots unto the River. 

13Why hast Thou broken down her 
fences, 

So that all they that pass by the way 
do pluck her? 

14The boar out of the wood doth 
ravage it, 

That which moveth in the field 
feedeth on it. 

15O God of hosts, return, we beseech 
Thee; 

Look from heaven, and behold, and 
be mindful of this vine, 

16And of the stock which Thy right 
hand hath planted, 

And the branch that Thou madest 
strong for Thyself. 
80 




17It is burned with fire, it is cut 
down; 

They perish at the rebuke of Thy 
countenance. 

18Let Thy hand be upon the man of 
Thy right hand, 

Upon the son of man whom Thou 
madest strong for Thyself. 

19So shall we not turn back from 
Thee; 

Quicken Thou us, and we will call 
upon Thy name. 

20O LORD God of hosts, restore us; 

Cause Thy face to shine, and we 
shall be saved. 

 

For the Leader; upon the 
Gittith. [A Psalm] of Asaph. 

 

2Sing aloud unto God our strength; 

Shout unto the God of Jacob. 

3Take up the melody, and sound the 
timbrel, 

The sweet harp with the psaltery. 

4Blow the horn at the new moon, 

At the full moon for our feast-day. 

5For it is a statute for Israel, 

An ordinance of the God of Jacob. 

6He appointed it in Joseph for a 
testimony, 

When He went forth against the land 
of Egypt. 

The speech of one that I knew not 
did I hear: 

 

7'I removed his shoulder from the 
burden; His hands were freed 
from the basket. 

8Thou didst call in trouble, and I 
rescued thee; I answered thee in 
the secret place of thunder; I 
proved thee at the waters of 
Meribah. Selah 

9Hear, O My people, and I will 
admonish thee: O Israel, if thou 
wouldest hearken unto Me! 

10There shall no strange god be in 
thee; neither shalt thou worship 
any foreign god. 

11I am the LORD thy God, who 
brought thee up out of the land of 
Egypt; open thy mouth wide, and 
I will fill it. 

 

12But My people hearkened not to 
My voice; 

And Israel would none of Me. 

13So I let them go after the 
stubbornness of their heart, 

That they might walk in their own 
counsels. 

14Oh that My people would hearken 
unto Me, 

That Israel would walk in My ways! 

15I would soon subdue their 
enemies, 

And turn My hand against their 
adversaries. 

16The haters of the LORD should 
dwindle away before Him; 

And their punishment should endure 
for ever. 

17They should also be fed with the 
fat of wheat; 

And with honey out of the rock 
would I satisfy thee.' 

 
81 




A Psalm of Asaph. 

 

God standeth in the congregation of 
God; 

In the midst of the judges He 
judgeth: 

2'How long will ye judge unjustly, 

And respect the persons of the 
wicked? Selah 

3Judge the poor and fatherless; 

Do justice to the afflicted and 
destitute. 

4Rescue the poor and needy; 

Deliver them out of the hand of the 
wicked. 

5They know not, neither do they 
understand; 

They go about in darkness; 

All the foundations of the earth are 
moved. 

6I said: Ye are godlike beings, 

And all of you sons of the Most 
High. 

7Nevertheless ye shall die like men, 

And fall like one of the princes.' 

 

8Arise, O God, judge the earth; 

For Thou shalt possess all the 
nations. 

 

A Song, a Psalm of Asaph. 

 

2O God, keep not Thou silence; 

Hold not Thy peace, and be not still, 
O God. 

3For, lo, Thine enemies are in an 
uproar; 

And they that hate Thee have lifted 
up the head. 

4They hold crafty converse against 
Thy people, 

And take counsel against Thy 
treasured ones. 

5They have said: 'Come, and let us 
cut them off from being a nation; 

That the name of Israel may be no 
more in remembrance.' 

6For they have consulted together 
with one consent; 

Against Thee do they make a 
covenant; 

7The tents of Edom and the 
Ishmaelites; 

Moab, and the Hagrites; 

8Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; 

Philistia with the inhabitants of 
Tyre; 

9Assyria also is joined with them; 

They have been an arm to the 
children of Lot. Selah 

 

10Do Thou unto them as unto 
Midian; 

As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the 
brook Kishon; 

11Who were destroyed at En-dor; 

They became as dung for the earth. 

12Make their nobles like Oreb and 
Zeeb, 

And like Zebah and Zalmunna all 
their princes; 

13Who said: 'Let us take to ourselves 
in possession 

The habitations of God.' 

14O my God, make them like the 
whirling dust; 

As stubble before the wind. 

15As the fire that burneth the forest, 
82 

83 




And as the flame that setteth the 
mountains ablaze; 

16So pursue them with Thy tempest, 

And affright them with Thy storm. 

17Fill their faces with shame; 

That they may seek Thy name, O 
LORD. 

18Let them be ashamed and 
affrighted for ever; 

Yea, let them be abashed and perish; 

19That they may know that it is Thou 
alone whose name is the LORD, 

The Most High over all the earth. 

 

For the Leader; upon the 
Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of 
Korah. 

 

2How lovely are Thy tabernacles, O 
LORD of hosts! 

3My soul yearneth, yea, even pineth 
for the courts of the LORD; 

My heart and my flesh sing for joy 
unto the living God. 

4Yea, the sparrow hath found a 
house, and the swallow a nest for 
herself, 

Where she may lay her young; 

Thine altars, O LORD of hosts, 

My King, and my God— 

5Happy are they that dwell in Thy 
house, 

They are ever praising Thee. Selah 

 

6Happy is the man whose strength is 
in Thee; 

In whose heart are the highways. 

7Passing through the valley of Baca 
they make it a place of springs; 

Yea, the early rain clotheth it with 
blessings. 

8They go from strength to strength, 

Every one of them appeareth before 
God in Zion. 

 

9O LORD God of hosts, hear my 
prayer; 

Give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah 

10Behold, O God our shield, 

And look upon the face of Thine 
anointed. 

11For a day in Thy courts is better 
than a thousand; 

I had rather stand at the threshold of 
the house of my God, 

Than to dwell in the tents of 
wickedness. 

12For the LORD God is a sun and a 
shield; 

The LORD giveth grace and glory; 

No good thing will He withhold 
from them that walk uprightly. 

13O LORD of hosts, 

Happy is the man that trusteth in 
Thee. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of the 
sons of Korah. 

 

2LORD, Thou hast been favourable 
unto Thy land, 

Thou hast turned the captivity of 
Jacob. 

3Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of 
Thy people, 

Thou hast pardoned all their sin. 

Selah 
84 

85 




4Thou hast withdrawn all Thy 
wrath; 

Thou hast turned from the fierceness 
of Thine anger. 

5Restore us, O God of our salvation, 

And cause Thine indignation toward 
us to cease. 

6Wilt Thou be angry with us for 
ever? 

Wilt Thou draw out Thine anger to 
all generations? 

7Wilt Thou not quicken us again, 

That Thy people may rejoice in 
Thee? 

8Show us Thy mercy, O LORD, 

And grant us Thy salvation. 

 

9I will hear what God the LORD will 
speak; 

For He will speak peace unto His 
people, and to His saints; 

But let them not turn back to folly. 

10Surely His salvation is nigh them 
that fear Him; 

That glory may dwell in our land. 

11Mercy and truth are met together; 

Righteousness and peace have 
kissed each other. 

12Truth springeth out of the earth; 

And righteousness hath looked 
down from heaven. 

13Yea, the LORD will give that which 
is good; 

And our land shall yield her 
produce. 

14Righteousness shall go before 
Him, 

And shall make His footsteps a way. 

 

A Prayer of David. 

 

Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and 
answer me; 

For I am poor and needy. 

2Keep my soul, for I am godly; 

O Thou my God, save Thy servant 
that trusteth in Thee. 

3Be gracious unto me, O Lord; 

For unto Thee do I cry all the day. 

4Rejoice the soul of Thy servant; 

For unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up 
my soul. 

5For Thou, Lord, art good, and 
ready to pardon, 

And plenteous in mercy unto all 
them that call upon Thee. 

 

6Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; 

And attend unto the voice of my 
supplications. 

7In the day of my trouble I call upon 
Thee; 

For Thou wilt answer me. 

8There is none like unto Thee 
among the gods, O Lord, 

And there are no works like Thine. 

9All nations whom Thou hast made 
shall come and prostrate 
themselves before Thee, O Lord; 

And they shall glorify Thy name. 

10For Thou art great, and doest 
wondrous things; 

Thou art God alone. 

 

11Teach me, O LORD, Thy way, that I 
may walk in Thy truth; 

Make one my heart to fear Thy 
name. 
86 




12I will thank Thee, O Lord my God, 
with my whole heart; 

And I will glorify Thy name for 
evermore. 

13For great is Thy mercy toward me; 

And Thou hast delivered my soul 
from the lowest nether-world. 

 

14O God, the proud are risen up 
against me, 

And the company of violent men 
have sought after my soul, 

And have not set Thee before them. 

15But Thou, O Lord, art a God full 
of compassion and gracious, 

Slow to anger, and plenteous in 
mercy and truth. 

16O turn unto me, and be gracious 
unto me; 

Give Thy strength unto Thy servant, 

And save the son of Thy handmaid. 

17Work in my behalf a sign for 
good; 

That they that hate me may see it, 
and be put to shame, 

Because Thou, LORD, hast helped 
me, and comforted me. 

 

A Psalm of the sons of Korah; 
a Song. 

 

His foundation is in the holy 
mountains. 

2The LORD loveth the gates of Zion 

More than all the dwellings of 
Jacob. 

3Glorious things are spoken of Thee, 

O city of God. Selah 

4'I will make mention of Rahab and 
Babylon as among them that 
know Me; 

Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with 
Ethiopia; 

This one was born there.' 

5But of Zion it shall be said: 'This 
man and that was born in her; 

And the Most High Himself doth 
establish her.' 

6The LORD shall count in the register 
of the peoples: 

'This one was born there.' Selah 

7And whether they sing or dance, 

All my thoughts are in Thee. 

 

A Song, a Psalm of the sons of 
Korah; for the Leader; upon 
Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of 
Heman the Ezrahite. 

 

2O LORD, God of my salvation, 

What time I cry in the night before 
Thee, 

3Let my prayer come before Thee, 

Incline Thine ear unto my cry. 

 

4For my soul is sated with troubles, 

And my life draweth nigh unto the 
grave. 

5I am counted with them that go 
down into the pit; 

I am become as a man that hath no 
help; 

6Set apart among the dead, 

Like the slain that lie in the grave, 

Whom Thou rememberest no more; 

And they are cut off from Thy hand. 

 
87 

88 




7Thou hast laid me in the nether-
most pit, 

In dark places, in the deeps. 

8Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, 

And all Thy waves Thou pressest 
down. Selah 

9Thou hast put mine acquaintance 
far from me; 

Thou hast made me an abomination 
unto them; 

I am shut up, and I cannot come 
forth. 

 

10Mine eye languisheth by reason of 
affliction; 

I have called upon Thee, O LORD, 
every day, 

I have spread forth my hands unto 
Thee. 

11Wilt Thou work wonders for the 
dead? 

Or shall the shades arise and give 
Thee thanks? Selah 

12Shall Thy mercy be declared in the 
grave? 

Or Thy faithfulness in destruction? 

13Shall Thy wonders be known in 
the dark? 

And Thy righteousness in the land 
of forgetfulness? 

 

14But as for me, unto Thee, O LORD, 
do I cry, 

And in the morning doth my prayer 
come to meet Thee. 

15LORD, why castest Thou off my 
soul? 

Why hidest Thou Thy face from 
me? 

16I am afflicted and at the point of 
death from my youth up; 

I have borne Thy terrors, I am 
distracted. 

17Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; 

Thy terrors have cut me off. 

18They came round about me like 
water all the day; 

They compassed me about together. 

19Friend and companion hast Thou 
put far from me, 

And mine acquaintance into 
darkness. 

 

Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. 

 

2I will sing of the mercies of the 
LORD for ever; 

To all generations will I make 
known Thy faithfulness with my 
mouth. 

3For I have said: 'For ever is mercy 
built; 

In the very heavens Thou dost 
establish Thy faithfulness. 

4I have made a covenant with My 
chosen, 

I have sworn unto David My 
servant: 

5For ever will I establish thy seed, 

And build up thy throne to all 
generations.' Selah 

 

6So shall the heavens praise Thy 
wonders, O LORD, 

Thy faithfulness also in the 
assembly of the holy ones. 

7For who in the skies can be 
compared unto the LORD, 
89 




Who among the sons of might can 
be likened unto the LORD, 

8A God dreaded in the great council 
of the holy ones, 

And feared of all them that are 
about Him? 

9O LORD God of hosts, 

Who is a mighty one, like unto 
Thee, O LORD? 

And Thy faithfulness is round about 
Thee. 

10Thou rulest the proud swelling of 
the sea; 

When the waves thereof arise, Thou 
stillest them. 

11Thou didst crush Rahab, as one 
that is slain; 

Thou didst scattered Thine enemies 
with the arm of Thy strength. 

12Thine are the heavens, Thine also 
the earth; 

The world and the fulness thereof, 
Thou hast founded them. 

13The north and the south, Thou hast 
created them; 

Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Thy 
name. 

14Thine is an arm with might; 

Strong is Thy hand, and exalted is 
Thy right hand. 

15Righteousness and justice are the 
foundation of Thy throne; 

Mercy and truth go before Thee. 

16Happy is the people that know the 
joyful shout; 

They walk, O LORD, in the light of 
Thy countenance. 

17In Thy name do they rejoice all the 
day; 

And through Thy righteousness are 
they exalted. 

18For Thou art the glory of their 
strength; 

And in Thy favour our horn is 
exalted. 

19For of the LORD is our shield; 

And the Holy One of Israel is our 
king. 

 

20Then Thou spokest in vision to 
Thy godly ones, 

And saidst: 'I have laid help upon 
one that is mighty; 

I have exalted one chosen out of the 
people. 

21I have found David My servant; 

With My holy oil have I anointed 
him; 

22With whom My hand shall be 
established; 

Mine arm also shall strengthen him. 

23The enemy shall not exact from 
him; 

Nor the son of wickedness afflict 
him. 

24And I will beat to pieces his 
adversaries before him, 

And smite them that hate him. 

25But My faithfulness and My mercy 
shall be with him; 

And through My name shall his 
horn be exalted. 

26I will set his hand also on the sea, 

And his right hand on the rivers. 

27He shall call unto Me: Thou art my 
Father, 

My God, and the rock of my 
salvation. 


28I also will appoint him first-born, 

The highest of the kings of the earth. 

29For ever will I keep for him My 
mercy, 

And My covenant shall stand fast 
with him. 

30His seed also will I make to endure 
for ever, 

And his throne as the days of 
heaven. 

31If his children forsake My law, 

And walk not in Mine ordinances; 

:32If they profane My statutes, 

And keep not My commandments; 

33Then will I visit their transgression 
with the rod, 

And their iniquity with strokes. 

34But My mercy will I not break off 
from him, 

Nor will I be false to My 
faithfulness. 

35My covenant will I not profane, 

Nor alter that which is gone out of 
My lips. 

36Once have I sworn by My 
holiness: 

Surely I will not be false unto 
David; 

37His seed shall endure for ever, 

And his throne as the sun before 
Me. 

38It shall be established for ever as 
the moon; 

And be stedfast as the witness in 
sky.' Selah 

 

39But Thou hast cast off and 
rejected, 

Thou hast been wroth with Thine 
anointed. 

40Thou hast abhorred the covenant 
of Thy servant; 

Thou hast profaned his crown even 
to the ground. 

41Thou hast broken down all his 
fences; 

Thou hast brought his strongholds to 
ruin. 

42All that pass by the way spoil him; 

He is become a taunt to his 
neighbours. 

43Thou hast exalted the right hand of 
his adversaries; 

Thou hast made all his enemies to 
rejoice. 

44Yea, Thou turnest back the edge of 
his sword, 

And hast not made him to stand in 
the battle. 

45Thou hast made his brightness to 
cease, 

And cast his throne down to the 
ground. 

46The days of his youth hast Thou 
shortened; 

Thou hast covered him with shame. 

Selah 

47How long, O LORD, wilt Thou hide 
Thyself for ever? 

How long shall Thy wrath burn like 
fire? 

48O remember how short my time is; 

For what vanity hast Thou created 
all the children of men! 

49What man is he that liveth and 
shall not see death, 


That shall deliver his soul from the 
power of the grave? Selah 

50Where are Thy former mercies, O 
Lord, 

Which Thou didst swear unto David 
in Thy faithfulness? 

51Remember, Lord, the taunt of Thy 
servants; 

How I do bear in my bosom [the 
taunt of] so many peoples; 

52Wherewith Thine enemies have 
taunted, O LORD, 

Wherewith they have taunted the 
footsteps of Thine anointed. 

53Blessed be the LORD for evermore. 

Amen, and Amen. 

 


 

A Prayer of Moses the man of 
God. 

 

Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling-
place in all generations. 

2Before the mountains were brought 
forth, 

Or ever Thou hadst formed the earth 
and the world, 

Even from everlasting to 
everlasting, Thou art God. 

3Thou turnest man to contrition; 

And sayest: 'Return, ye children of 
men.' 

4For a thousand years in Thy sight 

Are but as yesterday when it is past, 

And as a watch in the night. 

5Thou carriest them away as with a 
flood; they are as a sleep; 

In the morning they are like grass 
which groweth up. 

6In the morning it flourisheth, and 
groweth up; 

In the evening it is cut down, and 
withereth. 

 

7For we are consumed in Thine 
anger, 

And by Thy wrath are we hurried 
away. 

8Thou hast set our iniquities before 
Thee, 

Our secret sins in the light of Thy 
countenance. 

9For all our days are passed away in 
Thy wrath; 

We bring our years to an end as a 
tale that is told. 

10The days of our years are 
threescore years and ten, 

Or even by reason of strength 
fourscore years; 

Yet is their pride but travail and 
vanity; 

For it is speedily gone, and we fly 
away. 

11Who knoweth the power of Thine 
anger, 

And Thy wrath according to the fear 
that is due unto Thee? 

12So teach us to number our days, 

That we may get us a heart of 
wisdom. 

 

13Return, O LORD; how long? 
90 




And let it repent Thee concerning 
Thy servants. 

14O satisfy us in the morning with 
Thy mercy; 

That we may rejoice and be glad all 
our days. 

15Make us glad according to the 
days wherein Thou hast afflicted 
us, 

According to the years wherein we 
have seen evil. 

16Let Thy work appear unto Thy 
servants, 

And Thy glory upon their children. 

17And let the graciousness of the 
Lord our God be upon us; 

Establish Thou also upon us the 
work of our hands; 

Yea, the work of our hands establish 
Thou it. 

 

O thou that dwellest in the 
covert of the Most High, 

And abidest in the shadow of the 
Almighty; 

2I will say of the LORD, who is my 
refuge and my fortress, 

My God, in whom I trust, 

3That He will deliver thee from the 
snare of the fowler, 

And from the noisome pestilence. 

4He will cover thee with His 
pinions, 

And under His wings shalt thou take 
refuge; 

His truth is a shield and a buckler. 

 

5Thou shalt not be afraid of the 
terror by night, 

Nor of the arrow that flieth by day; 

6Of the pestilence that walketh in 
darkness, 

Nor of the destruction that wasteth 
at noonday. 

 

7A thousand may fall at Thy side, 

And ten thousand at Thy right hand; 

It shall not come nigh thee. 

8Only with thine eyes shalt thou 
behold, 

And see the recompense of the 
wicked. 

 

9For thou hast made the LORD who is 
my refuge, 

Even the Most High, thy habitation. 

10There shall no evil befall thee, 

Neither shall any plague come nigh 
thy tent. 

 

11For He will give His angels charge 
over thee, 

To keep thee in all thy ways. 

12They shall bear thee upon their 
hands, 

Lest thou dash thy foot against a 
stone. 

13Thou shalt tread upon the lion and 
asp; 

The young lion and the serpent shalt 
thou trample under feet. 

 

14'Because he hath set his love upon 
Me, therefore will I deliver him; 

I will set him on high, because he 
hath known My name. 

15He shall call upon Me, and I will 
answer him; 
91 




I will be with him in trouble; 

I will rescue him, and bring him to 
honour. 

16With long life will I satisfy him, 

And make Him to behold My 
salvation.' 

 

A Psalm, a Song. For the 
sabbath day. 

 

2It is a good thing to give thanks 
unto the LORD, 

And to sing praises unto Thy name, 
O Most High; 

3To declare Thy lovingkindness in 
the morning, 

And Thy faithfulness in the night 
seasons, 

4With an instrument of ten strings, 
and with the psaltery; 

With a solemn sound upon the harp. 

 

5For Thou, LORD, hast made me glad 
through Thy work; 

I will exult in the works of Thy 
hands. 

6How great are Thy works, O LORD! 

Thy thoughts are very deep. 

7A brutish man knoweth not, 

Neither doth a fool understand this. 

8When the wicked spring up as the 
grass, 

And when all the workers of 
iniquity do flourish; 

It is that they may be destroyed for 
ever. 

 

9But Thou, O LORD, art on high for 
evermore. 

10For, lo, Thine enemies, O LORD, 

For, lo, Thine enemies shall perish: 

All the workers of iniquity shall be 
scattered. 

11But my horn hast Thou exalted 
like the horn of the wild-ox; 

I am anointed with rich oil. 

12Mine eye also hath gazed on them 
that lie in wait for me, 

Mine ears have heard my desire of 
the evil-doers that rise up against 
me. 

 

13The righteous shall flourish like 
the palm-tree; 

He shall grow like a cedar in 
Lebanon. 

14Planted in the house of the LORD, 

They shall flourish in the courts of 
our God. 

15They shall still bring forth fruit in 
old age; 

They shall be full of sap and 
richness; 

16To declare that the LORD is upright, 

My Rock, in whom there is no 
unrighteousness. 

 

The LORD reigneth; He is 
clothed in majesty; 

The LORD is clothed, He hath girded 
Himself with strength; 

Yea, the world is established, that it 
cannot be moved. 

2Thy throne is established of old; 

Thou art from everlasting. 

 

3The floods have lifted up, O LORD, 
92 

93 




The floods have lifted up their 
voice; 

The floods lift up their roaring. 

4Above the voices of many waters, 

The mighty breakers of the sea, 

The LORD on high is mighty. 

 

5Thy testimonies are very sure, 

Holiness becometh Thy house, 

O LORD, for evermore. 

 

O LORD, Thou God to whom 
vengeance belongeth, 

Thou God to whom vengeance 
belongeth, shine forth. 

2Lift up Thyself, Thou Judge of the 
earth; 

Render to the proud their 
recompense. 

 

3LORD, how long shall the wicked, 

How long shall the wicked exult? 

4They gush out, they speak 
arrogancy; 

All the workers of iniquity bear 
themselves loftily. 

5They crush Thy people, O LORD, 

And afflict Thy heritage. 

6They slay the widow and the 
stranger, 

And murder the fatherless. 

7And they say: 'The LORD will not 
see, 

Neither will the God of Jacob give 
heed.' 

 

8Consider, ye brutish among the 
people; 

And ye fools, when will ye 
understand? 

9He that planted the ear, shall He not 
hear? 

He that formed the eye, shall He not 
see? 

10He that instructeth nations, shall 
not He correct? 

Even He that teacheth man 
knowledge? 

11The LORD knoweth the thoughts of 
man, 

That they are vanity. 

 

12Happy is the man whom Thou 
instructest, O LORD, 

And teachest out of Thy law; 

13That Thou mayest give him rest 
from the days of evil, 

Until the pit be digged for the 
wicked. 

14For the LORD will not cast off His 
people, 

Neither will He forsake His 
inheritance. 

15For right shall return unto justice, 

And all the upright in heart shall 
follow it. 

 

16Who will rise up for me against 
the evil-doers? 

Who will stand up for me against 
the workers of iniquity? 

17Unless the LORD had been my help, 

My soul had soon dwelt in silence. 

18If I say: 'My foot slippeth', 

Thy mercy, O LORD, holdeth me up. 

19When my cares are many within 
me, 
94 




Thy comforts delight my soul. 

 

20Shall the seat of wickedness have 
fellowship with Thee, 

Which frameth mischief by statute? 

21They gather themselves together 
against the soul of the righteous, 

And condemn innocent blood. 

22But the LORD hath been my high 
tower, 

And my God the rock of my refuge. 

23And He hath brought upon them 
their own iniquity, 

And will cut them off in their own 
evil; 

The LORD our God will cut them off. 

 

95 

96 



O come, let us sing unto the 
LORD; 

Let us shout for joy to the Rock of 
our salvation. 

2Let us come before His presence 
with thanksgiving, 

Let us shout for joy unto Him with 
psalms. 

3For the LORD is a great God, 

And a great King above all gods; 

4In whose hand are the depths of the 
earth; 

The heights of the mountains are 
His also. 

5The sea is His, and He made it; 

And His hands formed the dry land. 

6O come, let us bow down and bend 
the knee; 

Let us kneel before the LORD our 
Maker; 

7For He is our God, 

And we are the people of His 
pasture, and the flock of His 
hand. 

To-day, if ye would but hearken to 
His voice! 

8'Harden not your heart, as at 
Meribah, 

As in the day of Massah in the 
wilderness; 

9When your fathers tried Me, 

Proved Me, even though they saw 
My work. 

10For forty years was I wearied with 
that generation, 

And said: It is a people that do err in 
their heart, 

And they have not known My ways; 

11Wherefore I swore in My wrath, 

That they should not enter into My 
arest.' 

a See Deut. xii, 9. 

 

O sing unto the LORD a new 
song; 

Sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 

2Sing unto the LORD, bless His 
name; 

Proclaim His salvation from day to 
day. 

3Declare His glory among the 
nations, 

His marvellous works among all the 
peoples. 

 

4For great is the LORD, and highly to 
be praised; 

He is to be feared above all gods. 


5For all the gods of the peoples are 
things of nought; 

But the LORD made the heavens. 

6Honour and majesty are before 
Him; 

Strength and beauty are in His 
sanctuary. 

 

7Ascribe unto the LORD, ye kindreds 
of the peoples, 

Ascribe unto the LORD glory and 
strength. 

8Ascribe unto the LORD the glory 
due unto His name; 

Bring an offering, and come into 
His courts. 

9O worship the LORD in the beauty 
of holiness; 

Tremble before Him, all the earth. 

 

10Say among the nations: 'The LORD 
reigneth.' 

The world also is established that it 
cannot be moved; 

He will judge the peoples with 
equity. 

11Let the heavens be glad, and let 
the earth rejoice; 

Let the sea roar, and the fulness 
thereof; 

12Let the field exult; and all that is 
therein; 

Then shall all the trees of the wood 
sing for joy; 

13Before the LORD, for He is come; 

For He is come to judge the earth; 

He will judge the world with 
righteousness, 

And the peoples in His faithfulness. 

 

The LORD reigneth; let the 
earth rejoice; 

Let the multitude of isles be glad. 

2Clouds and darkness are round 
about Him; 

Righteousness and justice are the 
foundation of His throne. 

3A fire goeth before Him, 

And burneth up His adversaries 
round about. 

 

4His lightnings lighted up the world; 

The earth saw, and trembled. 

5The mountains melted like wax at 
the presence of the LORD, 

At the presence of the Lord of the 
whole earth. 

6The heavens declared His 
righteousness, 

And all the peoples saw His glory. 

 

7Ashamed be all they that serve 
graven images, 

That boast themselves of things of 
nought; 

Bow down to Him, all ye gods. 

8Zion heard and was glad, 

And the daughters of Judah 
rejoiced; 

Because of Thy judgments, O LORD. 

9For Thou, LORD, art most high 
above all the earth; 

Thou art exalted far above all gods. 

 

10O ye that love the LORD, hate evil; 

He preserveth the souls of His 
saints; 
97 




He delivered them out of the hand 
of the wicked. 

11Light is sown for the righteous, 

And gladness for the upright in 
heart. 

12Be glad in the LORD, ye righteous; 

And give thanks to His holy name. 

 

A Psalm. 

 

O sing unto the LORD a new song; 

For He hath done marvellous things; 

His right hand, and His holy arm, 
hath wrought salvation for Him. 

2The LORD hath made known His 
salvation; 

His righteousness hath He revealed 
in the sight of the nations. 

3He hath remembered His mercy 
and His faithfulness toward the 
house of Israel; 

All the ends of the earth have seen 
the salvation of our God. 

 

4Shout unto the LORD, all the earth; 

Break forth and sing for joy, yea, 
sing praises. 

5Sing praises unto the LORD with the 
harp; 

With the harp and the voice of 
melody. 

6With trumpets and sound of the 
horn 

Shout ye before the King, the LORD. 

 

7Let the sea roar, and the fulness 
thereof; 

The world, and they that dwell 
therein; 

8Let the floods clap their hands; 

Let the mountains sing for joy 
together; 

9Before the LORD, for He is come to 
judge the earth; 

He will judge the world with 
righteousness, 

And the peoples with equity. 

 

The LORD reigneth; let the 
peoples tremble; 

He is enthroned upon the cherubim; 
let the earth quake. 

2The LORD is great in Zion; 

And He is high above all the 
peoples. 

3Let them praise Thy name as great 
and awful; 

Holy is He. 

 

4The strength also of the king who 
loveth justice— 

Thou hast established equity, 

Thou hast executed justice and 
righteousness in Jacob. 

5Exalt ye the LORD our God, 

And prostrate yourselves at His 
footstool; 

Holy is He. 

 

6Moses and Aaron among His 
priests, 

And Samuel among them that call 
upon His name, 

Did call upon the LORD, and He 
answered them. 

7He spoke unto them in the pillar of 
cloud; 
98 

99 




They kept His testimonies, and the 
statute that He gave them. 

8O LORD our God, Thou didst 
answer them; 

A forgiving God wast Thou unto 
them, 

Though Thou tookest vengeance of 
their misdeeds. 

9Exalt ye the LORD our God, 

And worship at His holy hill; 

For the LORD our God is holy. 

 

A Psalm of thanksgiving. 

 

Shout unto the LORD, all the earth. 

2Serve the LORD with gladness; 

Come before His presence with 
singing. 

3Know ye that the LORD He is God; 

It is He that hath made us, and we 
are His, 

His people, and the flock of His 
pasture. 

4Enter into His gates with 
thanksgiving, 

And into His courts with praise; 

Give thanks unto Him, and bless His 
name. 

5For the LORD is good; His mercy 
endureth for ever; 

And His faithfulness unto all 
generations. 

 

A Psalm of David. 

 

I will sing of mercy and justice; 

Unto Thee, O LORD, will I sing 
praises. 

2I will give heed unto the way of 
integrity; 

Oh when wilt Thou come unto me? 

I will walk within my house in the 
integrity of my heart. 

 

3I will set no base thing before mine 
eyes; 

I hate the doing of things crooked; it 
shall not cleave unto me. 

4A perverse heart shall depart from 
me; 

I will know no evil thing. 

 

5Whoso slandereth his neighbour in 
secret, him will I destroy; 

Whoso is haughty of eye and proud 
of heart, him will I not suffer. 

6Mine eyes are upon the faithful of 
the land, that they may dwell with 
me; 

He that walketh in a way of 
integrity, he shall minister unto 
me. 

 

7He that worketh deceit shall not 
dwell within my house; 

He that speaketh falsehood shall not 
be established before mine eyes. 

8Morning by morning will I destroy 
all the wicked of the land; 

To cut off all the workers of iniquity 
from the city of the LORD. 

 

A Prayer of the afflicted, 
when he fainteth, and 
poureth out his complaint before the 
LORD. 

 
100 

101 

102 




2O LORD, hear my prayer, 

And let my cry come unto Thee. 

3Hide not Thy face from me in the 
day of my distress; 

Incline Thine ear unto me; 

In the day when I call answer me 
speedily. 

 

4For my days are consumed like 
smoke, 

And my bones are burned as a 
hearth. 

5My heart is smitten like grass, and 
withered; 

For I forget to eat my bread. 

6By reason of the voice of my 
sighing 

My bones cleave to my flesh. 

7I am like a pelican of the 
wilderness; 

I am become as an owl of the waste 
places. 

8I watch, and am become 

Like a sparrow that is alone upon 
the housetop. 

9Mine enemies taunt me all the day; 

They that are mad against me do 
curse by me. 

10For I have eaten ashes like bread, 

And mingled my drink with 
weeping, 

11Because of Thine indignation and 
Thy wrath; 

For Thou hast taken me up, and cast 
me away. 

12My days are like a lengthening 
shadow; 

And I am withered like grass. 

 

13But Thou, O LORD, sittest 
enthroned for ever; 

And Thy name is unto all 
generations. 

14Thou wilt arise, and have 
compassion upon Zion; 

For it is time to be gracious unto 
her, for the appointed time is 
come. 

15For Thy servants take pleasure in 
her stones, 

And love her dust. 

16So the nations will fear the name 
of the LORD, 

And all the kings of the earth Thy 
glory; 

17When the LORD hath built up Zion, 

When He hath appeared in His 
glory; 

18When He hath regarded the prayer 
of the destitute, 

And hath not despised their prayer. 

 

19This shall be written for the 
generation to come; 

And a people which shall be created 
shall praise the LORD. 

20For He hath looked down from the 
height of His sanctuary; 

From heaven did the LORD behold 
the earth; 

21To hear the groaning of the 
prisoner; 

To loose those that are appointed to 
death; 

22That men may tell of the name of 
the LORD in Zion, 

And His praise in Jerusalem; 


23When the peoples are gathered 
together, 

And the kingdoms, to serve the 
LORD. 

 

24He weakened my strength in the 
way; 

He shortened my days. 

25I say: 'O my God, take me not 
away in the midst of my days, 

Thou whose years endure 
throughout all generations. 

26Of old Thou didst lay the 
foundation of the earth; 

And the heavens are the work of 
Thy hands. 

27They shall perish, but Thou shalt 
endure; 

Yea, all of them shall wax old like a 
garment; 

As a vesture shalt Thou change 
them, and they shall pass away; 

28But Thou art the selfsame, 

And Thy years shall have no end. 

29The children of Thy servants shall 
dwell securely, 

And their seed shall be established 
before Thee.' 

 

[A Psalm] of David. 

 

Bless the LORD, O my soul; 

And all that is within me, bless His 
holy name. 

2Bless the LORD, O my soul, 

And forget not all His benefits; 

3Who forgiveth all thine iniquity; 

Who healeth all Thy diseases; 

4Who redeemeth Thy life from the 
pit; 

Who encompasseth thee with 
lovingkindness and tender 
mercies; 

5Who satisfieth thine old age with 
good things; 

So that Thy youth is renewed like 
the eagle. 

 

6The LORD executeth righteousness, 

And acts of justice for all that are 
oppressed. 

7He made known His ways unto 
Moses, 

His doings unto the children of 
Israel. 

8The LORD is full of compassion and 
gracious, 

Slow to anger, and plenteous in 
mercy. 

9He will not always contend; 

Neither will He keep His anger for 
ever. 

10He hath not dealt with us after our 
sins, 

Nor requited us according to our 
iniquities. 

11For as the heaven is high above the 
earth, 

So great is His mercy toward them 
that fear Him. 

12As far as the east is from the west, 

So far hath He removed our 
transgressions from us. 

13Like as a father hath compassion 
upon his children, 

So hath the LORD compassion upon 
them that fear Him. 
103 




14For He knoweth our frame; 

He remembereth that we are dust. 

15As for man, his days are as grass; 

As a flower of the field, so he 
flourisheth. 

16For the wind passeth over it, and it 
is gone; 

And the place thereof knoweth it no 
more. 

17But the mercy of the LORD is from 
everlasting to everlasting upon 
them that fear Him, 

And His righteousness unto 
children's children; 

18To such as keep His covenant, 

And to those that remember His 
precepts to do them. 

 

19The LORD hath established His 
throne in the heavens; 

And His kingdom ruleth over all. 

20Bless the LORD, ye angels of His, 

Ye mighty in strength, that fulfil His 
word, 

Hearkening unto the voice of His 
word. 

21Bless the LORD, all ye His hosts; 

Ye ministers of His, that do His 
pleasure. 

22Bless the LORD, all ye His works, 

In all places of His dominion; 

Bless the LORD, O my soul. 

 

Bless the LORD, O my 
soul. 

O LORD my God, Thou art very 
great; 

Thou art clothed with glory and 
majesty. 

2Who coverest Thyself with light as 
with a garment, 

Who stretchest out the heavens like 
a curtain; 

3Who layest the beams of Thine 
upper chambers in the waters, 

Who makest the clouds Thy chariot, 

Who walkest upon the wings of the 
wind; 

4Who makest winds Thy 
messengers, 

The flaming fire Thy ministers. 

 

5Who didst establish the earth upon 
its foundations, 

That it should not be moved for ever 
and ever; 

6Thou didst cover it with the deep as 
with a vesture; 

The waters stood above the 
mountains. 

7At Thy rebuke they fled, 

At the voice of Thy thunder they 
hasted away— 

8The mountains rose, the valleys 
sank down— 

Unto the place which Thou hadst 
founded for them; 

9Thou didst set a bound which they 
should not pass over, 

That they might not return to cover 
the earth. 

 

10Who sendest forth springs into the 
valleys; 

They run between the mountains; 

11They give drink to every beast of 
the field, 

The wild asses quench their thirst. 
104 




12Beside them dwell the fowl of the 
heaven, 

From among the branches they sing. 

13Who waterest the mountains from 
Thine upper chambers; 

The earth is full of the fruit of Thy 
works. 

 

14Who causeth the grass to spring up 
for the cattle, 

And herb for the service of man; 

To bring forth bread out of the earth, 

15And wine that maketh glad the 
heart of man, 

Making the face brighter than oil, 

And bread that stayeth man's heart. 

16The trees of the LORD have their 
fill, 

The cedars of Lebanon, which He 
hath planted; 

17Wherein the birds make their 
nests; 

As for the stork, the fir-trees are her 
house. 

18The high mountains are for the 
wild goats; 

The rocks are a refuge for the 
conies. 

 

19Who appointedst the moon for 
seasons; 

The sun knoweth his going down. 

20Thou makest darkness, and it is 
night, 

Wherein all the beasts of the forest 
do creep forth. 

21The young lions roar after their 
prey, 

And seek their food from God. 

22The sun ariseth, they slink away, 

And couch in their dens. 

23Man goeth forth unto his work 

And to his labour until the evening. 

 

24How manifold are Thy works, O 
LORD! 

In wisdom hast Thou made them all; 

The earth is full of Thy creatures. 

25Yonder sea, great and wide, 

Therein are creeping things 
innumerable, 

Living creatures, both small and 
great. 

26There go the ships; 

There is leviathan, whom Thou hast 
formed to sport therein. 

27All of them wait for Thee, 

That Thou mayest give them their 
food in due season. 

28Thou givest it unto them, they 
gather it; 

Thou openest Thy hand, they are 
satisfied with good. 

29Thou hidest Thy face, they vanish; 

Thou withdrawest their breath, they 
perish, 

And return to their dust. 

30Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they 
are created; 

And Thou renewest the face of the 
earth. 

 

31May the glory of the LORD endure 
for ever; 

Let the LORD rejoice in His works! 

32Who looketh on the earth, and it 
trembleth; 


He toucheth the mountains, and they 
smoke. 

33I will sing unto the LORD as long as 
I live; 

I will sing praise to my God while I 
have any being. 

34Let my musing be sweet unto 
Him; 

As for me, I will rejoice in the LORD. 

35Let sinners cease out of the earth, 

And let the wicked be no more. 

Bless the LORD, O my soul. 

aHallelujah. 

a That is, Praise ye the LORD. 

 

O give thanks unto the 
LORD, call upon His 
name; 

Make known His doings among the 
peoples. 

2Sing unto Him, sing praises unto 
Him; 

Speak ye of all His marvellous 
works. 

3Glory ye in His holy name; 

Let the heart of them rejoice that 
seek the LORD. 

4Seek ye the LORD and His strength; 

Seek His face continually. 

5Remember His marvellous works 
that He hath done, 

His wonders, and the judgments of 
His mouth; 

6O ye seed of Abraham His servant, 

Ye children of Jacob, His chosen 
ones. 

 

7He is the LORD our God; 

His judgments are in all the earth. 

8He hath remembered His covenant 
for ever, 

The word which He commanded to 
a thousand generations; 

9[The covenant] which He made 
with Abraham, 

And His oath unto Isaac; 

10And He established it unto Jacob 
for a statute, 

To Israel for an everlasting 
covenant; 

11Saying: 'Unto thee will I give the 
land of Canaan, 

The lot of your inheritance.' 

 

12When they were but a few men in 
number. 

Yea, very few, and sojourners in it, 

13And when they went about from 
nation to nation, 

From one kingdom to another 
people, 

14He suffered no man to do them 
wrong, 

Yea, for their sake He reproved 
kings: 

15'Touch not Mine anointed ones, 

And do My prophets no harm.' 

 

16And He called a famine upon the 
land; 

He broke the whole staff of bread. 

17He sent a man before them; 

Joseph was sold for a servant; 

18His feet they hurt with fetters, 

His person was laid in iron; 

19Until the time that his word came 
to pass, 
105 




The word of the LORD tested him. 

20The king sent and loosed him; 

Even the ruler of the peoples, and 
set him free. 

21He made him lord of his house, 

And ruler of all his possessions; 

22To bind his princes at his pleasure, 

And teach his elders wisdom. 

 

23Israel also came into Egypt; 

And Jacob sojourned in the land of 
Ham. 

24And He increased His people 
greatly, 

And made them too mighty for their 
adversaries. 

25He turned their heart to hate His 
people, 

To deal craftily with His servants. 

26He sent Moses His servant, 

And Aaron whom He had chosen. 

27They wrought among them His 
manifold signs, 

And wonders in the land of Ham. 

28He sent darkness, and it was dark; 

And they rebelled not against His 
word. 

29He turned their waters into blood, 

And slew their fish. 

30Their land swarmed with frogs, 

In the chambers of their kings. 

31He spoke, and there came swarms 
of flies, 

And gnats in all their borders. 

32He gave them hail for rain, 

And flaming fire in their land. 

33He smote their vines also and their 
fig-trees; 

And broke the trees of their borders. 

34He spoke, and the locust came, 

And the canker-worm without 
number, 

35And did eat up every herb in their 
land, 

And did eat up the fruit of their 
ground. 

36He smote also all the first-born in 
their land, 

The first-fruits of all their strength. 

37And He brought them forth with 
silver and gold; 

And there was none that stumbled 
among His tribes. 

38Egypt was glad when they 
departed; 

For the fear of them had fallen upon 
them. 

 

39He spread a cloud for a screen; 

And fire to give light in the night. 

40They asked, and He brought 
quails, 

And gave them in plenty the bread 
of heaven. 

41He opened the rock, and waters 
gushed out; 

They ran, a river in the dry places. 

42For He remembered His holy word 

Unto Abraham His servant; 

43And He brought forth His people 
with joy, 

His chosen ones with singing. 

44And He gave them the lands of the 
nations, 

And they took the labour of the 
peoples in possession; 

45That they might keep His statutes, 

And observe His laws. 


Hallelujah. 

 

Hallelujah. 

O give thanks unto the 
LORD; for He is good; 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

2Who can express the mighty acts of 
the LORD, 

Or make all His praise to be heard? 

3Happy are they that keep justice, 

That do righteousness at all times. 

4Remember me, O LORD, when Thou 
favourest Thy people; 

O think of me at Thy salvation; 

5That I may behold the prosperity of 
Thy chosen, 

That I may rejoice in the gladness of 
Thy nation, 

That I may glory with Thine 
inheritance. 

 

6We have sinned with our fathers, 

We have done iniquitously, we have 
dealt wickedly. 

7Our fathers in Egypt gave no heed 
unto Thy wonders; 

They remembered not the multitude 
of Thy mercies; 

But were rebellious at the sea, even 
at the Red Sea. 

8Nevertheless He saved them for 
His name's sake, 

That He might make His mighty 
power to be known. 

9And He rebuked the Red Sea, and it 
was dried up; 

And He led them through the 
depths, as through a wilderness. 

10And He saved them from the hand 
of him that hated them, 

And redeemed them from the hand 
of the enemy. 

11And the waters covered their 
adversaries; 

There was not one of them left. 

12Then believed they His words; 

They sang His praise. 

 

13They soon forgot His works; 

They waited not for His counsel; 

14But lusted exceedingly in the 
wilderness, 

And tried God in the desert. 

15And He gave them their request; 

But sent leanness into their soul. 

 

16They were jealous also of Moses 
in the camp, 

And of Aaron the holy one of the 
LORD. 

17The earth opened and swallowed 
up Dathan, 

And covered the company of 
Abiram. 

18And a fire was kindled in their 
company; 

The flame burned up the wicked. 

 

19They made a calf in Horeb, 

And worshipped a molten image. 

20Thus they exchanged their glory 

For the likeness of an ox that eateth 
grass. 

21They forgot God their saviour, 

Who had done great things in Egypt; 

22Wondrous works in the land of 
Ham, 
106 




Terrible things by the Red Sea. 

23Therefore He said that He would 
destroy them, 

Had not Moses His chosen stood 
before Him in the breach, 

To turn back His wrath, lest He 
should destroy them. 

 

24Moreover, they scorned the 
desirable land, 

They believed not His word; 

25And they murmured in their tents, 

They hearkened not unto the voice 
of the LORD. 

26Therefore He swore concerning 
them, 

That He would overthrow them in 
the wilderness; 

27And that He would cast out their 
seed among the nations, 

And scatter them in the lands. 

 

28They joined themselves also unto 
Baal of Peor, 

And ate the sacrifices of the dead. 

29Thus they provoked Him with 
their doings, 

And the plague broke in upon them. 

30Then stood up Phinehas, and 
wrought judgment, 

And so the plague was stayed. 

31And that was counted unto him for 
righteousness, 

Unto all generations for ever. 

 

32They angered Him also at the 
waters of Meribah, 

And it went ill with Moses because 
of them; 

33For they embittered his spirit, 

And he spoke rashly with his lips. 

 

34They did not destroy the peoples, 

As the LORD commanded them; 

35But mingled themselves with the 
nations, 

And learned their works; 

36And they served their idols, 

Which became a snare unto them; 

37Yea, they sacrificed their sons and 
their daughters unto demons, 

38And shed innocent blood, even the 
blood of their sons and of their 
daughters, 

Whom they sacrificed unto the idols 
of Canaan; 

And the land was polluted with 
blood. 

39Thus were they defiled with their 
works, 

And went astray in their doings. 

40Therefore was the wrath of the 
LORD kindled against His people, 

And He abhorred His inheritance. 

41And He gave them into the hand of 
the nations; 

And they that hated them ruled over 
them. 

42Their enemies also oppressed 
them, 

And they were subdued under their 
hand. 

43Many times did He deliver them; 

But they were rebellious in their 
counsel, 

And sank low through their iniquity. 

44Nevertheless He looked upon their 
distress, 


When He heard their cry; 

45And He remembered for them His 
covenant, 

And repented according to the 
multitude of His mercies. 

46He made them also to be pitied 

Of all those that carried them 
captive. 

 

47Save us, O LORD our God, 

And gather us from among the 
nations, 

That we may give thanks unto Thy 
holy name, 

That we may triumph in Thy praise. 

 

48Blessed be the LORD, the God of 
Israel, 

From everlasting even to 
everlasting, 

And let all the people say: 'Amen.' 
Hallelujah. 

 

 

'O give thanks unto the 
LORD, for He is good, 

For His mercy endureth for ever.' 

2So let the redeemed of the LORD 
say, 

Whom He hath redeemed from the 
hand of the adversary; 

3And gathered them out of the lands, 

From the east and from the west, 

From the north and from the sea. 

 

4They wandered in the wilderness in 
a desert way; 

They found no city of habitation. 

5Hungry and thirsty, 

Their soul fainted in them. 

6Then they cried unto the LORD in 
their trouble, 

And He delivered them out of their 
distresses. 

7And He led them by a straight way, 

That they might go to a city of 
habitation. 

8Let them give thanks unto the LORD 
for His mercy, 

And for His wonderful works to the 
children of men! 

9For He hath satisfied the longing 
soul, 

And the hungry soul He hath filled 
with good. 

 

10Such as sat in darkness and in the 
shadow of death, 

Being bound in affliction and iron— 

11Because they rebelled against the 
words of God, 

And contemned the counsel of the 
Most High. 

12Therefore He humbled their heart 
with travail, 

They stumbled, and there was none 
to help— 

13They cried unto the LORD in their 
trouble, 

And He saved them out of their 
distresses. 

14He brought them out of darkness 
and the shadow of death, 

And broke their bands in sunder. 
107 




15Let them give thanks unto the 
LORD for His mercy, 

And for His wonderful works to the 
children of men! 

16For He hath broken the gates of 
brass, 

And cut the bars of iron in sunder. 

 

17Crazed because of the way of their 
transgression, 

And afflicted because of their 
iniquities— 

18Their soul abhorred all manner of 
food, 

And they drew near unto the gates 
of death— 

19They cried unto the LORD in their 
trouble, 

And He saved them out of their 
distresses; 

20He sent His word, and healed 
them, 

And delivered them from their 
graves. 

21Let them give thanks unto the 
LORD for His mercy, 

And for His wonderful works to the 
children of men! 

22And let them offer the sacrifices of 
thanksgiving, 

And declare His works with singing. 

 

23They that go down to the sea in 
ships, 

That do business in great waters— 

24These saw the works of the LORD, 

And His wonders in the deep; 

25For He commanded, and raised the 
stormy wind, 

Which lifted up the waves thereof; 

26They mounted up to the heaven, 
they went down to the deeps; 

Their soul melted away because of 
trouble; 

27They reeled to and fro, and 
staggered like a drunken man, 

And all their wisdom was 
swallowed up— 

28They cried unto the LORD in their 
trouble, 

And He brought them out of their 
distresses. 

29He made the storm a calm, 

So that the waves thereof were still. 

30Then were they glad because they 
were quiet, 

And He led them unto their desired 
haven. 

31Let them give thanks unto the 
LORD for His mercy, 

And for His wonderful works to the 
children of men! 

32Let them exalt Him also in the 
assembly of the people, 

And praise Him in the seat of the 
elders. 

33He turneth rivers into a wilderness, 

And watersprings into a thirsty 
ground; 

34A fruitful land into a salt waste, 

For the wickedness of them that 
dwell therein. 

 

35He turneth a wilderness into a pool 
of water, 

And a dry land into watersprings. 

36And there He maketh the hungry 
to dwell, 


And they establish a city of 
habitation; 

37And sow fields, and plant 
vineyards, 

Which yield fruits of increase. 

38He blesseth them also, so that they 
are multiplied greatly, 

And suffereth not their cattle to 
decrease. 

 

39Again, they are minished and 
dwindle away 

Through oppression of evil and 
sorrow. 

40He poureth contempt upon princes, 

And causeth them to wander in the 
waste, where there is no way. 

41Yet setteth He the needy on high 
from affliction, 

And maketh his families like a 
flock. 

42The upright see it, and are glad; 

And all iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 

 

43Whoso is wise, let him observe 
these things, 

And let them consider the mercies 
of the LORD. 

 

A Song, a Psalm of David. 

 

2My heart is steadfast, O God; 

I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, 
even with my glory. 

3Awake, psaltery and harp; 

I will awake the dawn. 

4I will give thanks unto Thee, O 
LORD, among the peoples; 

And I will sing praises unto Thee 
among the nations. 

5For Thy mercy is great above the 
heavens, 

And Thy truth reacheth unto the 
skies. 

6Be Thou exalted, O God, above the 
heavens; 

And Thy glory be above all the 
earth. 

7That Thy beloved may be 
delivered, 

Save with Thy right hand, and 
answer me. 

 

8God spoke in His holiness, that I 
would exult; 

That I would divide Shechem, and 
mete out the valley of Succoth. 

9Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; 

Ephraim also is the defence of my 
head; 

Judah is my sceptre. 

10Moab is my washpot; 

Upon Edom do I cast my shoe; 

Over Philistia do I cry aloud. 

11Who will bring me into the 
fortified city? 

Who will lead me unto Edom? 

12Hast not Thou cast us off, O God? 

And Thou goest not forth, O God, 
with our hosts? 

13Give us help against the adversary; 

For vain is the help of man. 

14Through God we shall do 
valiantly; 

For He it is that will tread down our 
adversaries. 

 
108 




For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

O God of my praise, keep not 
silence; 

2For the mouth of the wicked and 
the mouth of deceit have they 
opened against me; 

They have spoken unto me with a 
lying tongue. 

3They compassed me about also 
with words of hatred, 

And fought against me without a 
cause. 

4In return for my love they are my 
adversaries; 

But I am all prayer. 

5And they have laid upon me evil 
for good, 

And hatred for my love: 

 

6’Set Thou a wicked man over him; 

And let an adversary stand at his 
right hand. 

7When he is judged, let him go forth 
condemned; 

And let his prayer be turned into sin. 

8Let his days be few; 

Let another take his charge. 

9Let his children be fatherless, 

And his wife a widow. 

10Let his children be vagabonds, and 
beg; 

And let them seek their bread out of 
their desolate places. 

11Let the creditor distrain all that he 
hath; 

And let strangers make spoil of his 
labour. 

12Let there be none to extend 
kindness unto him; 

Neither let there be any to be 
gracious unto his fatherless 
children. 

13Let his posterity be cut off; 

In the generation following let their 
name be blotted out. 

14Let the iniquity of his fathers be 
brought to remembrance unto the 
LORD; 

And let not the sin of his mother be 
blotted out. 

15Let them be before the LORD 
continually, 

That He may cut off the memory of 
them from the earth. 

16Because that he remembered not to 
do kindness, 

But persecuted the poor and needy 
man, 

And the broken in heart he was 
ready to slay. 

17Yea, he loved cursing, and it came 
unto him; 

And he delighted not in blessing, 
and it is far from him. 

18He clothed himself also with 
cursing as with his raiment, 

And it is come into his inward parts 
like water, 

And like oil into his bones. 

19Let it be unto him as the garment 
which he putteth on, 

And for the girdle wherewith he is 
girded continually.' 

 

20This would mine adversaries effect 
from the LORD, 
109 




And they that speak evil against my 
soul. 

21But Thou, O GOD the Lord, deal 
with me for Thy name's sake; 

Because Thy mercy is good, deliver 
Thou me. 

22For I am poor and needy, 

And my heart is wounded within 
me. 

23I am gone like the shadow when it 
lengtheneth; 

I am shaken off as the locust. 

24My knees totter through fasting; 

And my flesh is lean, and hath no 
fatness. 

25I am become also a taunt unto 
them; 

When they see me, they shake their 
head. 

 

26Help me, O LORD my God; 

O save me according to Thy mercy; 

27That they may know that this is 
Thy hand; 

That Thou, LORD, hast done it. 

28Let them curse, but bless Thou; 

When they arise, they shall be put to 
shame, but Thy servant shall 
rejoice. 

29Mine adversaries shall be clothed 
with confusion, 

And shall put on their own shame as 
a robe. 

30I will give great thanks unto the 
LORD with my mouth; 

Yea, I will praise Him among the 
multitude; 

31Because He standeth at the right 
hand of the needy, 

To save him from them that judge 
his soul. 

 

A Psalm of David. 

 

The LORD saith unto my lord: ‘Sit 
thou at My right hand, 

Until I make thine enemies thy 
footstool.' 

2The rod of Thy strength the LORD 
will send out of Zion: 

'Rule thou in the midst of thine 
enemies.' 

3Thy people offer themselves 
willingly in the day of thy 
warfare; 

In adornments of holiness, from the 
womb of the dawn, 

Thine is the dew of thy youth. 

 

4The LORD hath sworn, and will not 
repent: 

'Thou art a priest for ever 

After the manner of Melchizedek.' 

5The Lord at thy right hand 

Doth crush kings in the day of His 
wrath. 

6He will judge among the nations; 

He filleth it with the dead bodies, 

He crusheth the head over a wide 
land. 

7He will drink of the brook in the 
way; 

Therefore will he lift up the head. 

 

Hallelujah. 

 

. I will give thanks unto the LORD 
with my whole heart, 
110 

111 




. In the council of the upright, and in 
the congregation. 

. 2The works of the LORD are great, 

. Sought out of all them that have 
delight therein. 

. 3His work is glory and majesty; 

. And His righteousness endureth for 
ever. 

. 4He hath made a memorial for His 
wonderful works; 

. The LORD is gracious and full of 
compassion. 

. 5He hath given food unto them that 
fear Him; 

. He will ever be mindful of His 
covenant. 

. 6He hath declared to His people the 
power of His works, 

. In giving them the heritage of the 
nations. 

. 7The works of His hands are truth 
and justice; 

. All His precepts are sure. 

. 8They are established for ever and 
ever, 

. They are done in truth and 
uprightness. 

. 9He hath sent redemption unto His 
people; 

. He hath commanded His covenant 
for ever; 

. Holy and awful is His name. 

. 10The fear of the LORD is the 
beginning of wisdom; 

. A good understanding have all they 
that do thereafter; 

. His praise endureth for ever. 

 

Hallelujah. 

 

. Happy is the man that feareth the 
LORD, 

. That delighteth greatly in His 
commandments. 

. 2His seed shall be mighty upon 
earth; 

. The generation of the upright shall 
be blessed. 

. 3Wealth and riches are in his house; 

. And his merit endureth for ever. 

. 4Unto the upright He shineth as a 
light in the darkness, 

. Gracious, and full of compassion, 
and righteous. 

. 5Well is it with the man that dealeth 
graciously and lendeth, 

. That ordereth his affairs rightfully. 

. 6For he shall never be moved; 

. The righteous shall be had in 
everlasting remembrance. 

. 7He shall not be afraid of evil 
tidings; 

. His heart is stedfast, trusting in the 
LORD. 

. 8His heart is established, he shall not 
be afraid, 

. Until he gaze upon his adversaries. 

. 9He hath scattered abroad, he hath 
given to the needy; 

. His righteousness endureth for ever; 

. His horn shall be exalted in honour. 

. 10The wicked shall see it, and be 
vexed; 

. He shall gnash with his teeth, and 
melt away; 

. The desire of the wicked shall 
perish. 
112 




 

Hallelujah. 

Praise, O ye servants of the 
LORD, 

Praise the name of the LORD. 

2Blessed be the name of the LORD 

From this time forth and for ever. 

3From the rising of the sun unto the 
going down thereof 

The LORD'S name is to be praised. 

 

4The LORD is high above all nations, 

His glory is above the heavens. 

5Who is like unto the LORD our God, 

That is enthroned on high, 

6That looketh down low 

Upon heaven and upon the earth? 

 

7Who raiseth up the poor out of the 
dust, 

And lifteth up the needy out of the 
dunghill; 

8That He may set him with princes, 

Even with the princes of His people. 

9Who maketh the barren woman to 
dwell in her house 

As a joyful mother of children. 

Hallelujah. 

 

When Israel came forth out 
of Egypt, 

The house of Jacob from a people of 
strange language; 

2Judah became His sanctuary, 

Israel His dominion. 

 

3The sea saw it, and fled; 

The Jordan turned backward. 

4The mountains skipped like rams, 

The hills like young sheep. 

 

5What aileth thee, O thou sea, that 
thou fleest? 

Thou Jordan, that thou turnest 
backward? 

6Ye mountains, that ye skip like 
rams; 

Ye hills, like young sheep? 

7Tremble, thou earth, at the presence 
of the Lord, 

At the presence of the God of Jacob; 

8Who turned the rock into a pool of 
water, 

The flint into a fountain of waters. 

 

Not unto us, O LORD, not 
unto us, 

But unto Thy name give glory, 

For Thy mercy, and for Thy truth's 
sake. 

2Wherefore should the nations say: 

'Where is now their God?' 

 

3But our God is in the heavens; 

Whatsoever pleased Him He hath 
done. 

4Their idols are silver and gold, 

The work of men's hands. 

5They have mouths, but they speak 
not; 

Eyes have they, but they see not; 

6They have ears, but they hear not; 

Noses have they, but they smell not; 

7They have hands, but they handle 
not; 

Feet have they, but they walk not; 

Neither speak they with their throat. 
113 

114 

115 




8They that make them shall be like 
unto them; 

Yea, every one that trusteth in them. 

 

9O Israel, trust thou in the LORD! 

He is their help and their shield! 

10O house of Aaron, trust ye in the 
LORD! 

He is their help and their shield! 

11Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the 
LORD! 

He is their help and their shield. 

 

12The LORD hath been mindful of us, 
He will bless— 

He will bless the house of Israel; 

He will bless the house of Aaron. 

13He will bless them that fear the 
LORD, 

Both small and great. 

14The LORD increase you more and 
more, 

You and your children. 

15Blessed be ye of the LORD 

Who made heaven and earth. 

 

16The heavens are the heavens of the 
LORD; 

But the earth hath He given to the 
children of men. 

17The dead praise not the LORD, 

Neither any that go down into 
silence; 

18But we will bless the LORD 

From this time forth and for ever. 

Hallelujah. 

 

I love that the LORD should 
hear 

Mmy voice and my supplications. 

2Because He hath inclined His ear 
unto me, 

Therefore will I call upon Him all 
my days. 

 

3The cords of death compassed me, 

And the straits of the nether-world 
got hold upon me; 

I found trouble and sorrow. 

4But I called upon the name of the 
LORD: 

'I beseech thee, O LORD, deliver my 
soul.' 

5Gracious is the LORD, and 
righteous; 

Yea, our God is compassionate. 

6The LORD preserveth the simple; 

I was brought low, and He saved 
me. 

 

7Return, O my soul, unto Thy rest; 

For the LORD hath dealt bountifully 
with thee. 

8For thou hast delivered my soul 
from death, 

Mine eyes from tears, 

And my feet from stumbling. 

9I shall walk before the LORD 

In the lands of the living. 

10I trusted even when I spoke: 

'I am greatly afflicted.' 

11I said in my haste: 

'All men are liars.' 

 

12How can I repay unto the LORD 

All His bountiful dealings toward 
me? 

13I will lift up the cup of salvation, 116 




And call upon the name of the LORD. 

14My vows will I pay unto the LORD, 

Yea, in the presence of all His 
people. 

 

15Precious in the sight of the LORD 

Is the death of His saints. 

16I beseech Thee, O LORD, for I am 
Thy servant; 

I am Thy servant, the son of Thy 
handmaid; 

Thou hast loosed my bands. 

17I will offer to thee the sacrifice of 
thanksgiving, 

And will call upon the name of the 
LORD. 

18I will pay my vows unto the LORD, 

Yea, in the presence of all His 
people; 

19In the courts of the LORD’S house, 

In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. 

Hallelujah. 

 

O praise the LORD, all ye 
nations; 

Laud Him, all ye peoples. 

2For His mercy is great toward us; 

And the truth of the LORD endureth 
for ever. 

Hallelujah. 

 

'O give thanks unto the 
LORD, for He is good, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

2So let Israel now say, 

For His mercy endureth for ever, 

3So let the house of Aaron now say, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

4So let them now that fear the LORD 
say, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

 

5Out of my straits I called upon the 
LORD; 

He answered me with great 
enlargement. 

6The LORD is for me; I will not fear; 

What can man do unto me? 

7The LORD is for me as my helper; 

And I shall gaze upon them that hate 
me. 

8It is better to take refuge in the 
LORD 

Than to trust in man. 

9It is better to take refuge in the 
LORD 

Than to trust in princes. 

10All nations compass me about; 

Verily, in the name of the LORD I 
will cut them off. 

11They compass me about, yea, they 
compass me about; 

Verily, in the name of the LORD I 
will cut them off. 

12They compass me about like bees; 

They are quenched as the fire of 
thorns; 

Verily, in the name of the LORD I 
will cut them off. 

13Thou didst thrust sore at me that I 
might fall; 

But the LORD helped me. 

14The LORD is my strength and song; 

And He is become my salvation. 

15The voice of rejoicing and 
salvation is in the tents of the 
righteous; 
117 

118 




The right hand of the LORD doeth 
valiantly. 

16The right hand of the LORD is 
exalted; 

The right hand of the LORD doeth 
valiantly. 

17I shall not die, but live, 

And declare the works of the LORD. 

18The LORD hath chastened me sore; 

But He hath not given me over unto 
death. 

19Open to me the gates of 
righteousness; 

I will enter into them, I will give 
thanks unto the LORD. 

20This is the gate of the LORD; 

The righteous shall enter into it. 

21I will give thanks unto Thee, for 
Thou hast answered me, 

And art become my salvation. 

 

22The stone which the builders 
rejected 

Is become the chief corner-stone. 

 

23This is the LORD’S doing; 

It is marvellous in our eyes. 

 

24This is the day which the LORD 
hath made; 

We will rejoice and be glad in it. 

 

25We beseech Thee, O LORD, save 
now! 

We beseech Thee, O LORD, make us 
now to prosper! 

 

26Blessed be he that cometh in the 
name of the LORD; 

We bless you out of the house of the 
LORD. 

 

27The LORD is God, and hath given 
us light; 

Order the festival procession with 
boughs, even unto the horns of 
the altar. 

 

28Thou art my God, and I will give 
thanks unto Thee; 

Thou art my God, I will exalt Thee. 

 

29O give thanks unto the LORD, for 
He is good, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

 

 

. ALEPH. 

Happy are they that are upright in 
the way, 

Who walk in the law of the LORD. 

2Happy are they that keep His 
testimonies, 

That seek Him with the whole heart. 

3Yea, they do no unrighteousness; 

They walk in His ways. 

4Thou hast ordained Thy precepts, 

That we should observe them 
diligently. 

5Oh that my ways were directed 

To observe Thy statutes! 

6Then should I not be ashamed, 

When I have regard unto all Thy 
commandments. 

7I will give thanks unto Thee with 
uprightness of heart, 

When I learn Thy righteous 
ordinances. 
119 




8I will observe Thy statutes; 

O forsake me not utterly. 

 

 . BETH. 

9Wherewithal shall a young man 
keep his way pure? 

By taking heed thereto according to 
Thy word. 

10With my whole heart have I 
sought Thee; 

O let me not err from Thy 
commandments. 

11Thy word have I laid up in my 
heart, 

That I might not sin against Thee. 

12Blessed art Thou, O LORD; 

Teach me Thy statutes. 

13With my lips have I told 

All the ordinances of Thy mouth. 

14I have rejoiced in the way of Thy 
testimonies, 

As much as in all riches. 

15I will meditate in Thy precepts, 

And have respect unto Thy ways. 

16I will delight myself in Thy 
statutes; 

I will not forget Thy word. 

 

 . GIMEL. 

17Deal bountifully with Thy servant 
that I may live, 

And I will observe Thy word. 

18Open Thou mine eyes, that I may 
behold 

Wondrous things out of Thy law. 

19I am a sojourner in the earth; 

Hide not Thy commandments from 
me. 

20My soul breaketh for the longing 

That it hath unto Thine ordinances 
at all times. 

21Thou hast rebuked the proud that 
are cursed, 

That do err from Thy 
commandments. 

22Take away from me reproach and 
contempt; 

For I have kept Thy testimonies. 

23Even though princes sit and talk 
against me, 

Thy servant doth meditate in Thy 
statutes. 

24Yea, Thy testimonies are my 
delight, 

They are my counsellors. 

 

. DALETH. 

25My soul cleaveth unto the dust; 

Quicken Thou me according to Thy 
word. 

26I told of my ways, and Thou didst 
answer me; 

Teach me Thy statutes. 

27Make me to understand the way of 
Thy precepts, 

That I may talk of Thy wondrous 
works. 

28My soul melteth away for 
heaviness; 

Sustain me according unto Thy 
word. 

29Remove from me the way of 
falsehood; 

And grant me Thy law graciously. 

30I have chosen the way of 
faithfulness; 


Thine ordinances have I set [before 
me]. 

31I cleave unto Thy testimonies; 

O LORD, put me not to shame. 

32I will run the way of Thy 
commandments, 

For Thou dost enlarge my heart. 

 

. HE. 

33Teach me, O LORD, the way of Thy 
statutes; 

And I will keep it at every step. 

34Give me understanding, that I keep 
Thy law 

And observe it with my whole heart. 

35Make me to tread in the path of 
Thy commandments; 

For therein do I delight. 

36Incline my heart unto Thy 
testimonies, 

And not to covetousness. 

37Turn away mine eyes from 
beholding vanity, 

And quicken me in Thy ways. 

38Confirm Thy word unto Thy 
servant, 

Which pertaineth unto the fear of 
Thee. 

39Turn away my reproach which I 
dread; 

For Thine ordinances are good. 

40Behold, I have longed after Thy 
precepts; 

Quicken me in Thy righteousness. 

 

. VAU. 

41Let Thy mercies also come unto 
me, O LORD, 

Even Thy salvation, according to 
Thy word; 

42That I may have an answer for him 
that taunteth me; 

For I trust in Thy word. 

43And take not the word of truth 
utterly out of my mouth; 

For I hope in Thine ordinances; 

44So shall I observe Thy law 
continually 

For ever and ever; 

45And I will walk at ease, 

For I have sought Thy precepts; 

46I will also speak of Thy 
testimonies before kings, 

And will not be ashamed. 

47And I will delight myself in Thy 
commandments, 

Which I have loved. 

48I will lift up my hands also unto 
Thy commandments, which I 
have loved; 

And I will meditate in Thy statutes. 

. ZAIN. 

49Remember the word unto Thy 
servant, 

Because Thou hast made me to 
hope. 

50This is my comfort in my 
affliction, 

That Thy word hath quickened me. 

51The proud have had me greatly in 
derision; 

Yet have I not turned aside from 
Thy law. 

52I have remembered Thine 
ordinances which are of old, O 
LORD, 

And have comforted myself. 


53Burning indignation hath taken 
hold upon me, because of the 
wicked 

That forsake Thy law. 

54Thy statutes have been my songs 

In the house of my pilgrimage. 

55I have remembered Thy name, O 
LORD, in the night, 

And have observed Thy law. 

56This I have had, 

That I have kept Thy precepts. 

 

. HETH. 

57My portion is the LORD, 

I have said that I would observe Thy 
words. 

58I have entreated Thy favour with 
my whole heart; 

Be gracious unto me according to 
Thy word. 

59I considered my ways, 

And turned my feet unto Thy 
testimonies. 

60I made haste, and delayed not, 

To observe Thy commandments. 

61The bands of the wicked have 
enclosed me; 

But I have not forgotten Thy law. 

62At midnight I will rise to give 
thanks unto Thee 

Because of Thy righteous 
ordinances. 

63I am a companion of all them that 
fear Thee, 

And of them that observe Thy 
precepts. 

64The earth, O LORD, is full of Thy 
mercy; 

Teach me Thy statutes. 

. TETH. 

65Thou hast dealt well with Thy 
servant, 

O LORD, according unto Thy word. 

66Teach me good discernment and 
knowledge; 

For I have believed in Thy 
commandments. 

67Before I was afflicted, I did err; 

But now I observe Thy word. 

68Thou art good, and doest good; 

Teach me Thy statutes. 

69The proud have forged a lie 
against me; 

But I with my whole heart will keep 
Thy precepts. 

70Their heart is gross like fat; 

But I delight in Thy law. 

71It is good for me that I have been 
afflicted, 

In order that I might learn Thy 
statutes. 

72The law of Thy mouth is better 
unto me 

Than thousands of gold and silver. 

 

. IOD. 

73Thy hands have made me and 
fashioned me; 

Give me understanding, that I may 
learn Thy commandments. 

74They that fear Thee shall see me 
and be glad, 

Because I have hope in Thy word. 

75I know, O LORD, that Thy 
judgments are righteous, 

And that in faithfulness Thou hast 
afflicted me. 


76Let, I pray Thee, Thy 
lovingkindness be ready to 
comfort me, 

According to Thy promise unto Thy 
servant. 

77Let Thy tender mercies come unto 
me, that I may live; 

For Thy law is my delight. 

78Let the proud be put to shame, for 
they have distorted my cause with 
falsehood; 

But I will meditate in Thy precepts. 

79Let those that fear Thee return 
unto me, 

And they that know Thy 
testimonies. 

80Let my heart be undivided in Thy 
statutes, 

In order that I may not be put to 
shame. 

 

. CAPH. 

81My soul pineth for Thy salvation; 

In Thy word do I hope. 

82Mine eyes fail for Thy word, 

Saying: 'When wilt Thou comfort 
me?' 

83For I am become like a wine-skin 
in the smoke; 

Yet do I not forget Thy statutes. 

84How many are the days of Thy 
servant? 

When wilt Thou execute judgment 
on them that persecute me? 

85The proud have digged pits for me, 

Which is not according to Thy law. 

86All Thy commandments are 
faithful; 

They persecute me for nought; help 
Thou me. 

87They had almost consumed me 
upon earth; 

But as for me, I forsook not Thy 
precepts. 

88Quicken me after Thy 
lovingkindness, 

And I will observe the testimony of 
Thy mouth. 

 

. LAMED. 

89For ever, O LORD, 

Thy word standeth fast in heaven. 

90Thy faithfulness is unto all 
generations; 

Thou hast established the earth, and 
it standeth. 

91They stand this day according to 
Thine ordinances; 

For all things are Thy servants. 

92Unless Thy law had been my 
delight, 

I should then have perished in mine 
affliction. 

93I will never forget Thy precepts; 

For with them Thou hast quickened 
me. 

94I am Thine, save me; 

For I have sought Thy precepts. 

95The wicked have waited for me to 
destroy me; 

But I will consider Thy testimonies. 

96I have seen an end to every 
purpose; 

But Thy commandment is exceeding 
broad. 

 


. MEM. 

97O how love I Thy law! 

It is my meditation all the day. 

98Thy commandments make me 
wiser than mine enemies: 

For they are ever with me. 

99I have more understanding than all 
my teachers; 

For Thy testimonies are my 
meditation. 

100I understand more than mine 
elders, 

Because I have keep Thy precepts. 

101I have refrained my feet from 
every evil way, 

In order that I might observe Thy 
word. 

102I have not turned aside from 
Thine ordinances; 

For Thou hast instructed me. 

103How sweet are Thy words unto 
my palate! 

Yea, sweeter than honey to my 
mouth! 

104From Thy precepts I get 
understanding; 

Therefore I hate every false way. 

 

. NUN. 

105Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, 

And a light unto my path. 

106I have sworn, and have confirmed 
it, 

To observe Thy righteous 
ordinances. 

107I am afflicted very much; 

Quicken me, O LORD, according 
unto Thy word. 

108Accept, I beseech Thee, the 
freewill-offerings of my mouth, O 
LORD, 

And teach me Thine ordinances. 

109My soul is continually in my 
hand; 

Yet have I not forgotten Thy law. 

110The wicked have laid a snare for 
me; 

Yet went I not astray from Thy 
precepts. 

111Thy testimonies have I taken as a 
heritage for ever; 

For they are the rejoicing of my 
heart. 

112I have inclined my heart to 
perform Thy statutes, 

For ever, at every step. 

 

. SAMECH. 

113I hate them that are of a double 
mind; 

But Thy law do I love. 

114Thou art my covert and my 
shield; 

In Thy word do I hope. 

115Depart from me, ye evildoers; 

That I may keep the commandments 
of my God. 

116Uphold me according unto Thy 
word, that I may live; 

And put me not to shame in my 
hope. 

117Support Thou me, and I shall be 
saved; 

And I will occupy myself with Thy 
statutes continually. 

118Thou hast made light of all them 
that err from Thy statutes; 


For their deceit is vain. 

119Thou puttest away all the wicked 
of the earth like dross; 

Therefore I love Thy testimonies. 

120My flesh shuddereth for fear of 
Thee; 

And I am afraid of Thy judgments. 

 

. AIN. 

121I have done justice and 
righteousness; 

Leave me not to mine oppressors. 

122Be surety for Thy servant for 
good; 

Let not the proud oppress me. 

123Mine eyes fail for Thy salvation, 

And for Thy righteous word. 

124Deal with Thy servant according 
unto Thy mercy, 

And teach me Thy statutes. 

125I am Thy servant, give me 
understanding, 

That I may know Thy testimonies. 

126It is time for the LORD to work; 

They have made void Thy law. 

127Therefore I love Thy 
commandments 

Above gold, yea, above fine gold. 

128Therefore I esteem all [Thy] 
precepts concerning all things to 
be right; 

Every false way I hate. 

 

. PE. 

129Thy testimonies are wonderful; 

Therefore doth my soul keep them. 

130The opening of Thy words giveth 
light; 

It giveth understanding unto the 
simple. 

131I opened wide my mouth, and 
panted; 

For I longed for Thy 
commandments. 

132Turn Thee towards me, and be 
gracious unto me, 

As is Thy wont to do unto those that 
love Thy name. 

133Order my footsteps by Thy word; 

And let not any iniquity have 
dominion over me. 

134Redeem me from the oppression 
of man, 

And I will observe Thy precepts. 

135Make Thy face to shine upon Thy 
servant; 

And teach me Thy statutes. 

136Mine eyes run down with rivers 
of water, 

Because they observe not Thy law. 

 

. TZADE. 

137Righteous art Thou, O LORD, 

And upright are Thy judgments. 

138Thou hast commanded Thy 
testimonies in righteousness 

And exceeding faithfulness. 

139My zeal hath undone me, 

Because mine adversaries have 
forgotten Thy words. 

140Thy word is tried to the uttermost, 

And Thy servant loveth it. 

141I am small and despised; 

Yet have I not forgotten Thy 
precepts. 

142Thy righteousness is an 
everlasting righteousness, 


And Thy law is truth. 

143Trouble and anguish have 
overtaken me; 

Yet Thy commandments are my 
delight. 

144Thy testimonies are righteous for 
ever; 

Give me understanding, and I shall 
live. 

 

. KOPH. 

145I have called with my whole 
heart; answer me, O LORD; 

I will keep Thy statutes. 

146I have called Thee, save me, 

And I will observe Thy testimonies. 

147I rose early at dawn, and cried; 

I hoped in Thy word. 

148Mine eyes forestalled the night-
watches, 

That I might meditate in Thy word. 

149Hear my voice according unto 
Thy lovingkindness; 

Quicken me, O LORD, as Thou art 
wont. 

150They draw nigh that follow after 
wickedness; 

They are far from Thy law. 

151Thou art nigh, O LORD; 

And all Thy commandments are 
truth. 

152Of old have I known from Thy 
testimonies 

That Thou hast founded them for 
ever. 

 

 

 

. RESH. 

53O see mine affliction, and rescue 
me; 

For I do not forget Thy law. 

154Plead Thou my cause, and redeem 
me; 

Quicken me according to Thy word. 

155Salvation is far from the wicked; 

For they seek not Thy statutes. 

156Great are Thy compassions, O 
LORD; 

Quicken me as Thou art wont. 

157Many are my persecutors and 
mine adversaries; 

Yet have I not turned aside from 
Thy testimonies. 

158I beheld them that were faithless, 
and strove with them; 

Because they observed not Thy 
word. 

159O see how I love Thy precepts; 

Quicken me, O LORD, according to 
Thy lovingkindness. 

160The beginning of Thy word is 
truth; 

And all Thy righteous ordinance 
endureth for ever. 

 

. SHIN. 

161Princes have persecuted me 
without a cause; 

But my heart standeth in awe of Thy 
words. 

162I rejoice at Thy word, 

As one that findeth great spoil. 

163I hate and abhor falsehood; 

Thy law do I love. 


164Seven times a day do I praise 
Thee, 

Because of Thy righteous 
ordinances. 

165Great peace have they that love 
Thy law; 

And there is no stumbling for them. 

166I have hoped for Thy salvation, O 
LORD, 

And have done Thy 
commandments. 

167My soul hath observed Thy 
testimonies; 

And I love them exceedingly. 

168I have observed Thy precepts and 
Thy testimonies; 

For all my ways are before Thee. 

 

. TAU. 

169Let my cry come near before 
Thee, O LORD; 

Give me understanding according to 
Thy word. 

170Let my supplication come before 
Thee; 

Deliver me according to Thy word. 

171Let my lips utter praise: 

Because Thou teachest me Thy 
statutes. 

172Let my tongue sing of Thy word; 

For all Thy commandments are 
righteousness. 

173Let Thy hand be ready to help 
me; 

For I have chosen Thy precepts. 

174I have longed for Thy salvation, 
O LORD; 

And Thy law is my delight. 

175Let my soul live, and it shall 
praise Thee; 

And let Thine ordinances help me. 

176I have gone astray like a lost 
sheep; seek Thy servant; 

For I have not forgotten Thy 
commandments. 

 

A Song of Ascents. 

 

In my distress I called unto the 
LORD, 

And He answered me. 

2O LORD, deliver my soul from lying 
lips, 

From a deceitful tongue. 

3What shall be given unto thee, and 
what shall be done more unto 
thee, 

Thou deceitful tongue? 

4Sharp arrows of the mighty, 

With coals of broom. 

 

5Woe is me, that I sojourn with 
Meshech, 

That I dwell beside the tents of 
Kedar! 

6My soul hath full long had her 
dwelling 

With him that hateth peace. 

7I am all peace; 

But when I speak, they are for war. 

 

A Song of Ascents. 

 

I will lift up mine eyes unto the 
mountains: 

From whence shall my help come? 

2My help cometh from the LORD, 
120 

121 




Who made heaven and earth. 

 

3He will not suffer thy foot to be 
moved; 

He that keepeth thee will not 
slumber. 

4Behold, He that keepeth Israel 

Doth neither slumber nor sleep. 

 

5The LORD is thy keeper; 

The LORD is thy shade upon thy right 
hand. 

6The sun shall not smite thee by day, 

Nor the moon by night. 

 

7The LORD shall keep thee from all 
evil; 

He shall keep thy soul. 

8The LORD shall guard thy going out 
and thy coming in, 

From this time forth and for ever. 

 

A Song of Ascents; of 
David. 

 

I rejoiced when they said unto me: 

'Let us go unto the house of the 
LORD.' 

2Our feet are standing 

Within thy gates, O Jerusalem; 

3Jerusalem, that art builded 

As a city that is compact together; 

4Whither the tribes went up, even 
the tribes of the LORD, 

As a testimony unto Israel, 

To give thanks unto the name of the 
LORD. 

5For there were set thrones for 
judgment, 

The thrones of the house of David. 

 

6Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; 

May they prosper that love thee. 

7Peace be within thy walls, 

And prosperity within thy palaces. 

8For my brethren and companions' 
sakes, 

I will now say: 'Peace be within 
thee.' 

9For the sake of the house of the 
LORD our God 

I will seek thy good. 

 

A Song of Ascents. 

 

Unto Thee I lift up mine eyes, 

O Thou that art enthroned in the 
heavens. 

2Behold, as the eyes of servants unto 
the hand of their master, 

As the eyes of a maiden unto the 
hand of her mistress; 

So our eyes look unto the LORD our 
God, 

Until He be gracious unto us. 

 

3Be gracious unto us, O LORD, be 
gracious unto us; 

For we are full sated with contempt. 

4Our soul is full sated 

With the scorning of those that are 
at ease, 

And with the contempt of the proud 
oppressors. 

 

A Song of Ascents; of 
David.

'If it had not been the LORD who was 
for us', 

Let Israel now say; 

2'If it had not been the LORD who 
was for us, 

When men rose up against us, 

3Then they had swallowed us up 
alive, 

When their wrath was kindled 
against us; 

4Then the waters had overwhelmed 
us, 

The stream had gone over our soul; 

5Then the proud waters 

Had gone over our soul.' 

 

6Blessed be the LORD, 

Wo hath not given us as a prey to 
their teeth. 

7Our soul is escaped as a bird out of 
the snare of the fowlers; 

The snare is broken, and we are 
escaped. 

8Our help is in the name of the 
LORD, 

Who made heaven and earth. 

 

A Song of Ascents. 

 

They that trust in the LORD 

Are as mount Zion, which cannot be 
moved, but abideth for ever. 

2As the mountains are round about 
Jerusalem, 

So the LORD is round about His 
people, 

From this time forth and for ever. 

 

3For the rod of wickedness shall not 
rest upon the lot of the righteous; 

That the righteous put not forth their 
hands unto iniquity. 

 

4Do good, O LORD, unto the good, 

And to them that are upright in their 
hearts. 

5But as for such as turn aside unto 
their crooked ways, 

The LORD will lead them away with 
the workers of iniquity. 

Peace be upon Israel. 

 

A Song of Ascents. 

 

When the LORD brought back those 
that returned to Zion, 

We were like unto them that dream. 

2Then was our mouth filled with 
laughter, 

And our tongue with singing; 

Then said they among the nations: 

'The LORD hath done great things 
with these.' 

3The LORD hath done great things 
with us; 

We are rejoiced. 

 

4Turn our captivity, O LORD, 

As the streams in the dry land. 

5They that sow in tears 

Shall reap in joy. 

6Though he goeth on his way 
weeping that beareth the measure 
of seed, 

He shall come home with joy, 
bearing his sheaves. 

 
125 

126 




A Song of Ascents; of 
Solomon. 

 

Except the LORD build the house, 

They labour in vain that build it; 

Except the LORD keep the city, 

The watchman waketh but in vain. 

2It is vain for you that ye rise early, 
and sit up late, 

Ye that eat the bread of toil; 

So He giveth unto His beloved in 
sleep. 

 

3Lo, children are a heritage of the 
LORD; 

The fruit of the womb is a reward. 

4As arrows in the hand of a mighty 
man, 

So are the children of one's youth. 

5Happy is the man that hath his 
quiver full of them; 

They shall not be put to shame, 

When they speak with their enemies 
in the gate. 

 

A Song of Ascents. 

 

Happy is every one that feareth the 
LORD, 

That walketh in His ways. 

2When thou eatest the labour of thy 
hands, 

Happy shalt thou be, and it shall be 
well with thee. 

3Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, 
in the innermost parts of thy 
house; 

Thy children like olive plants, round 
about thy table. 

4Behold, surely thus shall the man 
be blessed 

That feareth the LORD. 

 

5The LORD bless thee out of Zion; 

And see thou the good of Jerusalem 
all the days of thy life; 

6And see thy children's children. 

Peace be upon Israel! 

 

A Song of Ascents. 

 

'Much have they afflicted me from 
my youth up', 

Let Israel now say; 

2'Much have they afflicted me from 
my youth up; 

But they have not prevailed against 
me. 

3The plowers plowed upon my back; 

They made long their furrows. 

4The LORD is righteous; 

He hath cut asunder the cords of the 
wicked.' 

 

5Let them be ashamed and turned 
backward, 

All they that hate Zion. 

6Let them be as the grass upon the 
housetops, 

Which withereth afore it springeth 
up; 

7Wherewith the reaper filleth not his 
hand, 

Nor he that bindeth sheaves his 
bosom. 

8Neither do they that go by say: 

‘The blessing of the LORD be upon 
you; 
127 

128 

129 




We bless you in the name of the 
LORD.'

132 



A Song of Ascents. 

 

Out of the depths have I called 
Thee, O LORD. 

2Lord, hearken unto my voice; 

Let Thine ears be attentive 

To the voice of my supplications. 

 

3If Thou, LORD, shouldest mark 
iniquities, 

O Lord, who could stand? 

4For with Thee there is forgiveness, 

That Thou mayest be feared. 

 

5I wait for the LORD, my soul doth 
wait, 

And in His word do I hope. 

6My soul waiteth for the Lord, 

More than watchmen for the 
morning; 

Yea, more than watchmen for the 
morning. 

 

7O Israel, hope in the LORD; 

For with the LORD there is mercy, 

And with Him is plenteous 
redemption. 

8And He will redeem Israel 

From all his iniquities. 

 

A Song of Ascents; of 
David. 

 

LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor 
mine eyes lofty; 

Neither do I exercise myself in 
things too great, or in things too 
wonderful for me. 

2Surely I have stilled and quieted 
my soul; 

Like a weaned child with his 
mother; 

My soul is with me like a weaned 
child. 

 

3O Israel, hope in the LORD 

From this time forth and for ever. 

 

A Song of Ascents. 

 

LORD, remember unto David 

All his affliction; 

2How he swore unto the LORD, 

And vowed unto the Mighty One of 
Jacob: 

3‘Surely I will not come into the tent 
of my house, 

Nor go up into the bed that is spread 
for me; 

4I will not give sleep to mine eyes, 

Nor slumber to mine eyelids; 

5Until I find out a place for the 
LORD, 

A dwelling-place for the Mighty 
One of Jacob.' 

 

6Lo, we heard of it as being in 
Ephrath; 

We found it in the field of athe 
wood. 

a Heb. Joar. See First Chr, xiii. 5. 

7Let us go into His dwelling-place; 

Let us worship at His footstool. 


8Arise, O LORD, unto Thy resting-
place; 

Thou, and the ark of Thy strength. 

9Let Thy priests be clothed with 
righteousness; 

And let Thy saints shout for joy. 

10For Thy servant David's sake 

Turn not away the face of Thine 
anointed. 

 

11The LORD swore unto David in 
truth; 

He will not turn back from it: 

'Of the fruit of thy body will I set 
upon thy throne. 

12If thy children keep My covenant 

And My testimony that I shall teach 
them, 

Their children also for ever shall sit 
upon thy throne.' 

13For the LORD hath chosen Zion; 

He hath desired it for His habitation: 

14'This is My resting-place for ever; 

Here will I dwell; for I have desired 
it. 

15I will abundantly bless her 
provision; 

I will give her needy bread in 
plenty. 

16Her priests also will I clothe with 
salvation; 

And her saints shall shout aloud for 
joy. 

17There will I make a horn to shoot 
up unto David, 

There have I ordered a lamp for 
Mine anointed. 

18His enemies will I clothe with 
shame; 

But upon himself shall his crown 
shine.' 

 

A Song of Ascents; of 
David. 

 

Behold, how good and how pleasant 
it is 

For brethren to dwell together in 
unity! 

2It is like the precious oil upon the 
head, 

Coming down upon the beard; 

Even Aaron's beard, 

That cometh down upon the collar 
of his garments; 

3Like the dew of Hermon, 

That cometh down upon the 
mountains of Zion; 

For there the LORD commanded the 
blessing, 

Even life for ever. 

 

A Song of Ascents. 

 

Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye 
servants of the LORD, 

That stand in the house of the LORD 
in the night seasons. 

2Lift up your hands to the sanctuary, 

And bless ye the LORD. 

 

3The LORD bless thee out of Zion; 

Even He that made heaven and 
earth. 

 

Hallelujah. 

Praise ye the name of the 
LORD; 
133 

134 

135 




Give praise, O ye servants of the 
LORD, 

2Ye that stand in the house of the 
LORD, 

In the courts of the house of our 
God. 

3Praise ye the LORD, for the LORD is 
good; 

Sing praises unto His name, for it is 
pleasant. 

4For the LORD hath chosen Jacob 
unto Himself, 

And Israel for His own treasure. 

 

5For I know that the LORD is great, 

And that our Lord is above all gods. 

6Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that 
hath He done, 

In heaven and in earth, in the seas 
and in all deeps; 

7Who causeth the vapours to ascend 
from the ends of the earth; 

He maketh lightnings for the rain; 

He bringeth forth the wind out of 
His treasuries. 

 

8Who smote the first-born of Egypt, 

Both of man and beast. 

9He sent signs and wonders into the 
midst of thee, O Egypt, 

Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his 
servants. 

 

10Who smote many nations, 

And slew mighty kings: 

11Sihon king of the Amorites, 

And Og king of Bashan, 

And all the kingdoms of Canaan; 

12And gave their land for a heritage, 

A heritage unto Israel His people. 

 

13O LORD, Thy name endureth for 
ever; 

Thy memorial, O LORD, throughout 
all generations. 

14For the LORD will judge His 
people, 

And repent Himself for His 
servants. 

15The idols of the nations are silver 
and gold, 

The work of men's hands. 

16They have mouths, but they speak 
not; 

Eyes have they, but they see not; 

17They have ears, but they hear not; 

Neither is there any breath in their 
mouths. 

18They that make them shall be like 
unto them; 

Yea, every one that trusteth in them. 

 

19O house of Israel, bless ye the 
LORD; 

O house of Aaron, bless ye the 
LORD; 

20O house of Levi, bless ye the 
LORD; 

Ye that fear the LORD, bless ye the 
LORD. 

21Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, 

Who dwelleth at Jerusalem. 

Hallelujah. 

 

O give thanks unto the 
LORD, for He is good, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 
136 




2O give thanks unto the God of 
gods, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

3O give thanks unto the Lord of 
lords, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

 

4To Him who alone doeth great 
wonders, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

5To Him that by understanding 
made the heavens, for His mercy 
endureth for ever. 

6To Him that spread forth the earth 
above the waters, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

7To Him that made great lights, 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

8The sun to rule by day, 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

9The moon and stars to rule by 
night, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

 

10To Him that smote Egypt in their 
first-born, 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

11And brought out Israel from 
among them, 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

12With a strong hand, and with an 
outstretched arm, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

13To Him who divided the Red Sea 
in sunder, 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

14And made Israel to pass through 
the midst of it, 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

15But overthrew Pharaoh and his 
host in the Red Sea, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

16To Him that led His people 
through the wilderness, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

 

17To Him that smote great kings; 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

18And slew mighty kings, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

19Sihon king of the Amorites, 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

20And Og king of Bashan, 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

21And gave their land for a heritage, 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

22Even a heritage unto Israel His 
servant, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

 

23Who remembered us in our low 
estate, 

For His mercy endureth for ever; 

24And hath delivered us from our 
adversaries, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

25Who giveth food to all flesh, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

26O give thanks unto the God of 
heaven, 

For His mercy endureth for ever. 

 

By the rivers of Babylon, 

There we sat down, yea, we 
wept, 

When we remembered Zion. 

2Upon the willows in the midst 
thereof 
137 




We hanged up our harps. 

3For there they that led us captive 
asked of us words of song, 

And our tormentors asked of us 
mirth: 

‘Sing us one of the songs of Zion.' 

4How shall we sing the LORD’S song 

In a foreign land? 

5If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, 

Let my right hand forget her 
cunning. 

6Let my tongue cleave to the roof of 
my mouth, 

If I remember thee not; 

If I set not Jerusalem 

Above my chiefest joy. 

 

7Remember, O LORD, against the 
children of Edom 

The day of Jerusalem; 

Who said: 'Rase it, rase it, 

Even to the foundation thereof.' 

8O daughter of Babylon, that art to 
be destroyed; 

Happy shall he be, that repayeth 
thee 

As thou hast served us. 

9Happy shall he be, that taketh and 
dasheth thy little ones 

Against the rock. 

 

[A Psalm] of David. 

 

I will give Thee thanks with my 
whole heart, 

In the presence of the mighty will I 
sing praises unto Thee. 

2I will bow down toward Thy holy 
temple, 

And give thanks unto Thy name for 
Thy mercy and for Thy truth; 

For Thou hast magnified Thy word 
above all Thy name. 

3In the day that I called, Thou didst 
answer me; 

Thou didst encourage me in my soul 
with strength. 

 

4All the kings of the earth shall give 
Thee thanks, O LORD, 

For they have heard the words of 
Thy mouth. 

5Yea, they shall sing of the ways of 
the LORD; 

For great is the glory of the LORD. 

6For though the LORD be high, yet 
regardeth He the lowly, 

And the haughty He knoweth from 
afar. 

7Though I walk in the midst of 
trouble, Thou quickenest me; 

Thou stretchest forth Thy hand 
against the wrath of mine 
enemies, 

And Thy right hand doth save me. 

8The LORD will accomplish that 
which concerneth me; 

Thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for 
ever; 

Forsake not the work of Thine own 
hands. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

O LORD, Thou hast searched me, and 
known me. 
138 

139 




2Thou knowest my downsitting and 
mine uprising, 

Thou understandest my thought afar 
off. 

3Thou measurest my going about 
and my lying down, 

And art acquainted with all my 
ways. 

4For there is not a word in my 
tongue, 

But, lo, O LORD, Thou knowest it 
altogether. 

5Thou hast hemmed me in behind 
and before, 

And laid Thy hand upon me. 

6Such knowledge is too wonderful 
for me; 

Too high, I cannot attain unto it. 

 

7Whither shall I go from Thy spirit? 

Or whither shall I flee from Thy 
presence? 

8If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art 
there; 

If I make my bed in the nether-
world, behold, Thou art there. 

9If I take the wings of the morning, 

And dwell in the uttermost parts of 
the sea; 

10Even there would Thy hand lead 
me, 

And Thy right hand would hold me. 

11And if I say: ‘Surely the darkness 
shall envelop me, 

And the light about me shall be 
night'; 

12Even the darkness is not too dark 
for Thee, 

But the night shineth as the day; 

The darkness is even as the light. 

 

13For Thou hast made my reins; 

Thou hast knit me together in my 
mother's womb. 

14I will give thanks unto Thee, for I 
am fearfully and wonderfully 
made; 

Wonderful are Thy works; and that 
my soul knoweth right well. 

15My frame was not hidden from 
Thee, 

When I was made in secret, 

And curiously wrought in the lowest 
parts of the earth. 

16Thine eyes did see mine unformed 
substance, 

And in Thy book they were all 
written— 

Even the days that were fashioned, 

When as yet there was none of 
them. 

17How weighty also are Thy 
thoughts unto me, O God! 

How great is the sum of them! 

18If I would count them, they are 
more in number than the sand; 

Were I to come to the end of them, I 
would still be with Thee. 

 

19If Thou but wouldest slay the 
wicked, O God— 

Depart from me therefore, ye men 
of blood; 

20Who utter Thy name with wicked 
thought, 

They take it for falsehood, even 
Thine enemies— 


21Do not I hate them, O LORD, that 
hate Thee? 

And do not I strive with those that 
rise up against Thee? 

22I hate them with utmost hatred; 

I count them mine enemies. 

23Search me, O God, and know my 
heart, 

Try me, and know my thoughts; 

24And see if there be any way in me 
that is grievous, 

And lead me in the way everlasting. 

 

For the Leader. A Psalm of 
David. 

 

2Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil 
man; 

Preserve me from the violent man; 

3Who devise evil things in their 
heart; 

Every day do they stir up wars. 

4They have sharpened their tongue 
like a serpent; 

Vipers' venom is under their lips. 

Selah 

 

5Keep me, O LORD, from the hands 
of the wicked; 

Preserve me from the violent man; 

Who have purposed to make my 
steps slip. 

6The proud have hid a snare for me, 
and cords; 

They have spread a net by the 
wayside; 

They have set gins for me. Selah 

 

7I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art 
my God'; 

Give ear, O LORD, unto the voice of 
my supplications. 

8O GOD the Lord, the strength of my 
salvation, 

Who hast screened my head in the 
day of battle, 

9Grant not, O LORD, the desires of 
the wicked; 

Further not his evil device, so that 
they exalt themselves. Selah 

 

10As for the head of those that 
compass me about, 

Let the mischief of their own lips 
cover them. 

11Let burning coals fall upon them; 

Let them be cast into the fire, 

Into deep pits, that they rise not up 
again. 

12A slanderer shall not be 
established in the earth; 

The violent and evil man shall be 
hunted with thrust upon thrust. 

 

13I know that the LORD will maintain 
the cause of the poor, 

And the right of the needy. 

14Surely the righteous shall give 
thanks unto Thy name; 

The upright shall dwell in Thy 
presence. 

 

A Psalm of David. 

 

LORD, I have called Thee; make 
haste unto me; 
140 

141 




Give ear unto my voice, when I call 
unto Thee. 

2Let my prayer be set forth as 
incense before Thee, 

The lifting up of my hands as the 
evening sacrifice. 

3Set a guard, O LORD, to my mouth; 

Keep watch at the door of my lips. 

4Incline not my heart to any evil 
thing, 

To be occupied in deeds of 
wickedness 

With men that work iniquity; 

And let me not eat of their dainties. 

 

5Let the righteous smite me in 
kindness, and correct me; 

Oil so choice let not my head refuse; 

For still is my prayer because of 
their wickedness. 

6Their judges are thrown down by 
the sides of the rock; 

And they shall hear my words, that 
they are sweet. 

7As when one cleaveth and breaketh 
up the earth, 

Our bones are scattered at the 
grave's mouth. 

 

8For mine eyes are unto Thee, O 
GOD the Lord; 

In Thee have I taken refuge, O pour 
not out my soul. 

9Keep me from the snare which they 
have laid for me, 

And from the gins of the workers of 
iniquity. 

10Let the wicked fall into their own 
nets, 

Whilst I withal escape. 

 

Maschil of David, when he 
was in the cave; a Prayer. 

 

2With my voice I cry unto the LORD; 

With my voice I make supplication 
unto the LORD. 

3I pour out my complaint before 
Him, 

I declare before Him my trouble; 

4When my spirit fainteth within 
me— 

Thou knowest my path— 

In the way wherein I walk 

Have they hidden a snare for me. 

5Look on my right hand, and see, 

For there is no man that knoweth 
me; 

I have no way to flee; 

No man careth for my soul. 

 

6I have cried unto Thee, O LORD; 

I have said: 'Thou art my refuge, 

My portion in the land of the living.' 

7Attend unto my cry; 

For I am brought very low; 

Deliver me from my persecutors; 

For they are too strong for me. 

8Bring my soul out of prison, 

That I may give thanks unto Thy 
name; 

The righteous shall crown 
themselves because of me; 

For Thou wilt deal bountifully with 
me. 

 

A Psalm of David. 

 
142 

143 




O LORD, hear my prayer, give ear to 
my supplications; 

In Thy faithfulness answer me, and 
in Thy righteousness. 

2And enter not into judgment with 
Thy servant; 

For in Thy sight shall no man living 
be justified. 

 

3For the enemy hath persecuted my 
soul; 

He hath crushed my life down to the 
ground; 

He hath made me to dwell in 
darkness, as those that have been 
long dead. 

4And my spirit fainteth within me; 

My heart within me is appalled. 

 

5I remember the days of old; 

I meditate on all Thy doing; 

I muse on the work of Thy hands. 

6I spread forth my hands unto Thee; 

My soul [thirsteth] after Thee, as a 
weary land. Selah 

 

7Answer me speedily, O LORD, 

My spirit faileth; 

Hide not Thy face from me; 

Lest I become like them that go 
down into the pit. 

8Cause me to hear Thy 
lovingkindness in the morning, 

For in Thee do I trust; 

Cause me to know the way wherein 
I should walk, 

For unto Thee have I lifted up my 
soul. 

 

9Deliver me from mine enemies, O 
LORD; 

With Thee have I hidden myself. 

10Teach me to do Thy will, 

For Thou art my God; 

Let Thy good spirit 

Lead me in an even land. 

11For Thy name's sake, O LORD, 
quicken me; 

In Thy righteousness bring my soul 
out of trouble. 

12And in Thy mercy cut off mine 
enemies, 

And destroy all them that harass my 
soul; 

For I am Thy servant. 

 

[A Psalm] of David. 

 

Blessed be the LORD my Rock, 

Who traineth my hands for war, 

And my fingers for battle; 

2My lovingkindness, and my 
fortress, 

My high tower, and my deliverer; 

My shield, and He in whom I take 
refuge; 

Who subdueth my people under me. 

 

3LORD, what is man, that Thou takest 
knowledge of him? 

Or the son of man, that Thou makest 
account of him? 

4Man is like unto a breath; 

His days are as a shadow that 
passeth away. 

5O LORD, bow Thy heavens, and 
come down; 
144 




Touch the mountains, that they may 
smoke. 

6Cast forth lightning, and scatter 
them; 

Send out Thine arrows, and 
discomfit them. 

7Stretch forth Thy hands from on 
high; 

Rescue me, and deliver me out of 
many waters, 

Out of the hand of strangers; 

8Whose mouth speaketh falsehood, 

And their right hand is a right hand 
of lying. 

 

9O God, I will sing a new song unto 
Thee, 

Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I 
sing praises unto Thee; 

10Who givest salvation unto kings, 

Who rescuest David Thy servant 
from the hurtful sword. 

11Rescue me, and deliver me out of 
the hand of strangers, 

Whose mouth speaketh falsehood, 

And their right hand is a right hand 
of lying. 

 

12We whose sons are as plants 
grown up in their youth; 

Whose daughters are as corner-
pillars carved after the fashion of 
a palace; 

13Whose garners are full, affording 
all manner of store; 

Whose sheep increase by thousands 
and ten thousands in our fields; 

14Whose oxen are well laden; 

With no breach, and no going forth, 

And no outcry in our broad places; 

15Happy is the people that is in such 
a case. 

Yea, happy is the people whose God 
is the LORD. 

 

[A Psalm of] praise; of 
David. 

 

. I will extol Thee, my God, O 

 King; 

 And I will bless Thy name for ever 
and ever. 

. 2Every day will I bless Thee; 

 And I will praise Thy name for ever 
and ever. 

. 3Great is the LORD, and highly to be 
praised; 

 And His greatness is unsearchable. 

. 
4One generation shall laud Thy 
works to another, 

 And shall declare Thy mighty acts. 

. 
5The glorious splendour of Thy 
majesty, 

 And Thy wondrous works, will I 
rehearse. 

. 
6And men shall speak of the might 
of Thy tremendous acts; 

 And I will tell of Thy greatness. 

. 
7They shall utter the fame of Thy 
great goodness, 

 And shall sing of Thy righteousness. 

. 
8The LORD is gracious, and full of 
compassion; 

 Slow to anger, and of great mercy. 

. 
9The LORD is good to all; 
145 




 And His tender mercies are over all 
His works. 

. 
10All Thy works shall praise Thee, O 
LORD; 

 And Thy saints shall bless Thee. 

. 
11They shall speak of the glory of 
Thy kingdom, 

 And talk of Thy might; 

. 
12To make known to the sons of men 
His mighty acts, 

 And the glory of the majesty of His 
kingdom. 

. 
13Thy kingdom is a kingdom for all 
ages, 

 And Thy dominion endureth 
throughout all generations. 

. 
14The LORD upholdeth all that fall, 

 And raiseth up all those that are 
bowed down. 

. 
15The eyes of all wait for Thee, 

 And Thou givest them their food in 
due season. 

. 
16Thou openest Thy hand, 

 And satisfiest every living thing 
with favour. 

. 
17The LORD is righteous in all His 
ways, 

 And gracious in all His works. 

. 
18The LORD is nigh unto all them that 
call upon Him, 

 To all that call upon Him in truth. 

. 
19He will fulfil the desire of them 
that fear Him; 

 He also will hear their cry, and will 
save them. 

. 
20The LORD preserveth all them that 
love Him; 

 But all the wicked will He destroy. 

. 
21My mouth shall speak the praise of 
the LORD; 

And let all flesh bless His holy 
name for ever and ever. 

 

Hallelujah. 

Praise the LORD, O my soul. 

2I will praise the LORD while I live; 

I will sing praises unto my God 
while I have my being. 

 

3Put not your trust in princes, 

Nor in the son of man, in whom 
there is no help. 

4His breath goeth forth, he returneth 
to his dust; 

In that very day his thoughts perish. 

5Happy is he whose help is the God 
of Jacob, 

Whose hope is in the LORD his God, 

6Who made heaven and earth, 

The sea, and all that in them is; 

Who keepeth truth for ever; 

7Who executeth justice for the 
oppressed; 

Who giveth bread to the hungry. 

 

The LORD looseth the prisoners; 

8The LORD openeth the eyes of the 
blind; 

The LORD raiseth up them that are 
bowed down; 

The LORD loveth the righteous; 

9The LORD preserveth the strangers; 

He upholdeth the fatherless and the 
widow; 
146 




But the way of the wicked He 
maketh crooked. 

10The LORD will reign for ever, 

Thy God, O Zion, unto all 
generations. 

Hallelujah. 

 

Hallelujah; 

For it is good to sing 
praises unto our God; 

For it is pleasant, and praise is 
comely. 

2The LORD doth build up Jerusalem, 

He gathereth together the dispersed 
of Israel; 

3Who healeth the broken in heart, 

And bindeth up their wounds. 

4He counteth the number of the 
stars; 

He giveth them all their names. 

5Great is our Lord, and mighty in 
power; 

His understanding is infinite. 

6The LORD upholdeth the humble; 

He bringeth the wicked down to the 
ground. 

7Sing unto the LORD with 
thanksgiving, 

Sing praises upon the harp unto our 
God; 

8Who covereth the heaven with 
clouds, 

Who prepareth rain for the earth, 

Who maketh the mountains to 
spring with grass. 

9He giveth to the beast his food, 

And to the young ravens which cry. 

10He delighteth not in the strength of 
the horse; 

He taketh no pleasure in the legs of 
a man. 

11The LORD taketh pleasure in them 
that fear Him, 

In those that wait for His mercy. 

 

12Glorify the LORD, O Jerusalem; 

Praise thy God, O Zion. 

13For He hath made strong the bars 
of thy gates; 

He hath blessed thy children within 
thee. 

14He maketh thy borders peace; 

He giveth thee in plenty the fat of 
wheat. 

15He sendeth out His commandment 
upon earth; 

His word runneth very swiftly. 

16He giveth snow like wool; 

He scattereth the hoar-frost like 
ashes. 

17He casteth forth His ice like 
crumbs; 

Who can stand before His cold? 

18He sendeth forth His word, and 
melteth them; 

He causeth His wind to blow, and 
the waters flow. 

19He declareth His word unto Jacob, 

His statutes and His ordinances unto 
Israel. 

20He hath not dealt so with any 
nation; 

And as for His ordinances, they 
have not known them. 

Hallelujah. 

 

Hallelujah. 

Praise ye the LORD from the 
147 

148 




 heavens; 

Praise Him in the heights. 

2Praise ye Him, all His angels; 

Praise ye Him, all His hosts. 

3Praise ye Him, sun and moon; 

Praise Him, all ye stars of light. 

4Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens, 

And ye waters that are above the 
heavens. 

5Let them praise the name of the 
LORD; 

For He commanded, and they were 
created. 

6He hath also established them for 
ever and ever; 

He hath made a decree which shall 
not be transgressed. 

 

7Praise the LORD from the earth, 

Ye sea-monsters, and all deeps; 

8Fire and hail, snow and vapour, 

Stormy wind, fulfilling His word; 

9Mountains and all hills, 

Fruitful trees and all cedars; 

10Beasts and all cattle, 

Creeping things and winged fowl; 

11Kings of the earth and all peoples, 

Princes and all judges of the earth; 

12Both young men and maidens, 

Old men and children; 

13Let them praise the name of the 
LORD, 

For His name alone is exalted; 

His glory is above the earth and 
heaven. 

14And He hath lifted up a horn for 
His people, 

A praise for all His saints, 

Even for the children of Israel, a 
people near unto Him. 

Hallelujah. 

 

Hallelujah. 

Sing unto the LORD a new 
song, 

And His praise in the assembly of 
the saints. 

2Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; 

Let the children of Zion be joyful in 
their King. 

3Let them praise His name in the 
dance; 

Let them sing praises unto Him with 
the timbrel and harp. 

4For the LORD taketh pleasure in His 
people; 

He adorneth the humble with 
salvation. 

 

5Let the saints exult in glory; 

Let them sing for joy upon their 
beds. 

6Let the high praises of God be in 
their mouth, 

And a two-edged sword in their 
hand; 

7To execute vengeance upon the 
nations, 

And chastisements upon the 
peoples; 

8To bind their kings with chains, 

And their nobles with fetters of iron; 

9To execute upon them the 
judgment written; 

He is the glory of all His saints. 

Hallelujah. 

 
149 




Hallelujah. 

Praise God in His 
sanctuary; 

Praise Him in the firmament of His 
power. 

2Praise Him for His mighty acts; 

Praise Him according to His 
abundant greatness. 

3Praise Him with the blast of the 
horn; 

Praise Him with the psaltery and 
harp. 

4Praise Him with the timbrel and 
dance; 

Praise Him with stringed 
instruments and the pipe. 

5Praise Him with the loud-sounding 
cymbals; 

Praise Him with the clanging 
cymbals. 

6Let every thing that hath breath 
praise the LORD. 

Hallelujah.
