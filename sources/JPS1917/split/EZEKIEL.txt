EZEKIEL 

 

Now it came to pass in the 
thirtieth year, in the fourth month, 
in the fifth day of the month, as I was 
among the captives by the river 
Chebar that the heavens were opened, 
and I saw visions of God. 2In the fifth 
day of the month, which was the fifth 
year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity, 
3the word of the LORD came expressly 
unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of 
Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by 
the river Chebar; and the hand of the 
LORD was there upon him. 

4And I looked, and, behold, a 
stormy wind came out of the north, a 
great cloud, with a fire flashing up, so 
that a brightness was round about it; 
and out of the midst thereof as the 
colour of electrum, out of the midst of 
the fire. 5And out of the midst thereof 
came the likeness of four living 
creatures. And this was their 
appearance: they had the likeness of a 
man. 6And every one had four faces, 
and every one of them had four wings. 
7And their feet were straight feet; and 
the sole of their feet was like the sole 
of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like 
the colour of burnished brass. 8And 
they had the hands of a man under 
their wings on their four sides; and as 
for the faces and wings of them four, 
9their wings were joined one to 
another; they turned not when they 
went; they went every one straight 
forward. 10As for the likeness of their 
faces, they had the face of a man; and 
they four had the face of a lion on the 
right side; and they four had the face 
of an ox on the left side; they four had 
also the face of an eagle. 11Thus were 
their faces; and their wings were 
stretched upward; two wings of every 
one were joined one to another, and 
two covered their bodies. 12And they 
went every one straight forward; 
whither the spirit was to go, they went; 
they turned not when they went. 13As 
for the likeness of the living creatures, 
their appearance was like coals of fire, 
burning like the appearance of torches; 
it flashed up and down among the 
living creatures; and there was 
brightness to the fire, and out of the 
fire went forth lightning. 14And the 
living creatures ran and returned as the 
appearance of a flash of lightning. 

15Now as I beheld the living 
creatures, behold one wheel at the 
bottom hard by the living creatures, at 
the four faces thereof. 16The 
appearance of the wheels and their 
work was like unto the colour of a 
beryl; and they four had one likeness; 
and their appearance and their work 
was as it were a wheel within a wheel. 
17When they went, they went toward 
their four sides; they turned not when 
1 




they went. 18As for their rings, they 
were high and they were dreadful; and 
they four had their rings full of eyes 
round about. 19And when the living 
creatures went, the wheels went hard 
by them; and when the living creatures 
were lifted up from the bottom, the 
wheels were lifted up. 20Whithersoever 
the spirit was to go, as the spirit was to 
go thither, so they went; and the 
wheels were lifted up beside them; for 
the spirit of the living creature was in 
the wheels. 21When those went, these 
went, and when those stood, these 
stood; and when those were lifted up 
from the earth, the wheels were lifted 
up beside them; for the spirit of the 
living creature was in the wheels. 

22And over the heads of the living 
creatures there was the likeness of a 
firmament, like the colour of the 
terrible ice, stretched forth over their 
heads above. 23And under the 
firmament were their wings 
conformable the one to the other; this 
one of them had two which covered, 
and that one of them had two which 
covered, their bodies. 24And when they 
went, I heard the noise of their wings 
like the noise of great waters, like the 
voice of the Almighty, a noise of 
tumult like the noise of a host; when 
they stood, they let down their wings. 
25For, when there was a voice above 
the firmament that was over their 
heads, as they stood, they let down 
their wings. 

26And above the firmament that was 
over their heads was the likeness of a 
throne, as the appearance of a sapphire 
stone; and upon the likeness of the 
throne was a likeness as the 
appearance of a man upon it above. 
27And I saw as the colour of electrum, 
as the appearance of fire round about 
enclosing it, from the appearance of 
his loins and upward; and from the 
appearance of his loins and downward 
I saw as it were the appearance of fire, 
and there was brightness round about 
him. 28As the appearance of the bow 
that is in the cloud in the day of rain, 
so was the appearance of the 
brightness round about. This was the 
appearance of the likeness of the glory 
of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell 
upon my face, and I heard a voice of 
one that spoke. 

And He said unto me: ‘Son of 
man, stand upon thy feet, and I 
will speak with thee.’ 2And spirit 
entered into me when He spoke unto 
me, and set me upon my feet; and I 
heard Him that spoke unto me. 

3And He said unto me: ‘Son of man, 
I send thee to the children of Israel, to 
rebellious nations, that have rebelled 
against Me; they and their fathers have 
transgressed against Me, even unto 
this very day; 4and the children are 
brazen-faced and stiff-hearted, I do 
send thee unto them; and thou shalt 
say unto them: Thus saith the Lord 
GOD. 5And they, whether they will 
hear, or whether they will forbear—for 
they are a rebellious house—yet shall 
know that there hath been a prophet 
among them. 
2 




6And thou, son of man, be not afraid 
of them, neither be afraid of their 
words, though defiers and despisers be 
with thee, and thou dost dwell among 
scorpions; be not afraid of their words, 
nor be dismayed at their looks, for 
they are a rebellious house. 7And thou 
shalt speak My words unto them, 
whether they will hear, or whether 
they will forbear; for they are most 
rebellious. 

8And thou, son of man, hear what I 
say unto thee: be not thou rebellious 
like that rebellious house; open thy 
mouth, and eat that which I give thee.’ 
9And when I looked, behold, a hand 
was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of 
a book was therein; 10and He spread it 
before me, and it was written within 
and without; and there was written 
therein lamentations, and moaning, 
and woe. 

And He said unto me: ‘Son of 
man, eat that which thou findest; 
eat this roll, and go, speak unto the 
house of Israel.’ 2So I opened my 
mouth, and He caused me to eat that 
roll. 3And He said unto me: ‘Son of 
man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy 
bowels with this roll that I give thee.’ 
Then did I eat it; and it was in my 
mouth as honey for sweetness. 

4And He said unto me: ‘Son of man, 
go, get thee unto the house of Israel, 
and speak with My words unto them. 
5For thou art not sent to a people of an 
unintelligible speech and of a slow 
tongue, but to the house of Israel; 6not 
to many peoples of an unintelligible 
speech and of a slow tongue, whose 
words thou canst not understand. 
Surely, if I sent thee to them, they 
would hearken unto thee. 7But the 
house of Israel will not consent to 
hearken unto thee; for they consent not 
to hearken unto Me; for all the house 
of Israel are of a hard forehead and of 
a stiff heart. 8Behold, I have made thy 
face hard against their faces, and thy 
forehead hard against their foreheads. 
9As an adamant harder than flint have I 
made thy forehead; fear them not, 
neither be dismayed at their looks, for 
they are a rebellious house.’ 

10Moreover He said unto me: ‘Son 
of man, all My words that I shall speak 
unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear 
with thine ears. 11And go, get thee to 
them of the captivity, unto the children 
of thy people, and speak unto them, 
and tell them: Thus saith the Lord 
GOD; whether they will hear, or 
whether they will forbear.’ 

12Then a spirit lifted me up, and I 
heard behind me the voice of a great 
rushing: ‘Blessed be the glory of the 
LORD from His place’; 13also the noise 
of the wings of the living creatures as 
they touched one another, and the 
noise of the wheels beside them, even 
the noise of a great rushing. 14So a 
spirit lifted me up, and took me away; 
and I went in bitterness, in the heat of 
my spirit, and the hand of the LORD 
was strong upon me. 15Then I came to 
them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that 
dwelt by the river Chebar, and I sat 
3 




where they sat; and I remained there 
appalled among them seven days. 

16And it came to pass at the end of 
seven days, that the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 17’Son of man, I 
have appointed thee a watchman unto 
the house of Israel; and when thou 
shalt hear a word at My mouth, thou 
shalt give them warning from Me. 
18When I say unto the wicked: Thou 
shalt surely die; and thou givest him 
not warning, nor speakest to warn the 
wicked from his wicked way, to save 
his life; the same wicked man shall die 
in his iniquity, but his blood will I 
require at thy hand. 19Yet if thou warn 
the wicked, and he turn not from his 
wickedness, nor from his wicked way, 
he shall die in his iniquity; but thou 
hast delivered thy soul. 20Again, when 
a righteous man doth turn from his 
righteousness, and commit iniquity, I 
will lay a stumblingblock before him, 
he shall die; because thou hast not 
given him warning, he shall die in his 
sin, and his righteous deeds which he 
hath done shall not be remembered; 
but his blood will I require at thy hand. 
21Nevertheless if thou warn the 
righteous man, that the righteous sin 
not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely 
live, because he took warning; and 
thou hast delivered thy soul.’ 

22And the hand of the LORD came 
there upon me; and He said unto me: 
‘Arise, go forth into the plain, and I 
will there speak with thee.’ 23Then I 
arose, and went forth into the plain; 
and, behold, the glory of the LORD 
stood there, as the glory which I saw 
by the river Chebar; and I fell on my 
face. 24Then spirit entered into me, and 
set me upon my feet; and He spoke 
with me, and said unto me: ‘Go, shut 
thyself within thy house. 25But thou, 
son of man, behold, bands shall be put 
upon thee, and thou shalt be bound 
with them, and thou shalt not go out 
among them; 26and I will make thy 
tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, 
that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not 
be to them a reprover; for they are a 
rebellious house. 27But when I speak 
with thee, I will open thy mouth, and 
thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith 
the Lord GOD; he that heareth, let him 
hear, and he that forbeareth, let him 
forbear; for they are a rebellious 
house. 

Thou also, son of man, take thee a 
tile, and lay it before thee, and 
trace upon it a city, even Jerusalem; 
2and lay siege against it, and build 
forts against it, and cast up a mound 
against it; set camps also against it, 
and set battering rams against it round 
about. 3And take thou unto thee an iron 
griddle, and set it for a wall of iron 
between thee and the city; and set thy 
face toward it, and it shall be besieged, 
and thou shalt lay siege against it. This 
shall be a sign to the house of Israel. 

4Moreover lie thou upon thy left 
side, and lay the iniquity of the house 
of Israel upon it; according to the 
number of the days that thou shalt lie 
upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity. 
5For I have appointed the years of their 
4 




iniquity to be unto thee a number of 
days, even three hundred and ninety 
days; so shalt thou bear the iniquity of 
the house of Israel. 6And again, when 
thou hast accomplished these, thou 
shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt 
bear the iniquity of the house of Judah; 
forty days, each day for a year, have I 
appointed it unto thee. 7And thou shalt 
set thy face toward the siege of 
Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; 
and thou shalt prophesy against it. 
8And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, 
and thou shalt not turn thee from one 
side to another, till thou hast 
accomplished the days of thy siege. 
9Take thou also unto thee wheat, and 
barley, and beans, and lentils, and 
millet, and spelt, and put them in one 
vessel, and make thee bread thereof; 
according to the number of the days 
that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even 
three hundred and ninety days, shalt 
thou eat thereof. 10And thy food which 
thou shalt eat shall be by weight, 
twenty shekels a day; from time to 
time shalt thou eat it. 11Thou shalt 
drink also water by measure, the sixth 
part of a hin; from time to time shalt 
thou drink. 12And thou shalt eat it as 
barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in 
their sight with dung that cometh out 
of man.’ 

13And the LORD said: ‘Even thus 
shall the children of Israel eat their 
bread unclean, among the nations 
whither I will drive them.’ 14Then said 
I: ‘Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath 
not been polluted; for from my youth 
up even till now have I not eaten of 
that which dieth of itself, or is torn of 
beasts; neither came there abhorred 
flesh into my mouth.’ 15Then He said 
unto me: ‘See, I have given thee cow’s 
dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt 
prepare thy bread thereon.’ 16Moreover 
He said unto me: ‘Son of man, behold, 
I will break the staff of bread in 
Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by 
weight, and with anxiety; and they 
shall drink water by measure, and in 
appalment; 17that they may want bread 
and water, and be appalled one with 
another, and pine away in their 
iniquity. 

 

And thou, son of man, take thee a 
sharp sword, as a barber’s razor 
shalt thou take it unto thee, and cause 
it to pass upon thy head and upon thy 
beard; then take thee balances to 
weigh, and divide the hair. 2A third 
part shalt thou burn in the fire in the 
midst of the city, when the days of the 
siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take 
a third part, and smite it with the 
sword round about her; and a third part 
thou shalt scatter to the wind, and I 
will draw out a sword after them. 
3Thou shalt also take thereof a few by 
number, and bind them in thy skirts. 
4And of them again shalt thou take, 
and cast them into the midst of the fire, 
and burn them in the fire; therefrom 
shall a fire come forth into all the 
house of Israel. 

5Thus saith the Lord GOD: This is 
Jerusalem! I have set her in the midst 
5 




of the nations, and countries are round 
about her. 6And she hath rebelled 
against Mine ordinances in doing 
wickedness more than the nations, and 
against My statutes more than the 
countries that are round about her; for 
they have rejected Mine ordinances, 
and as for My statutes, they have not 
walked in them. 7Therefore thus saith 
the Lord GOD: Because ye have 
outdone the nations that are round 
about you, in that ye have not walked 
in My statutes, neither have kept Mine 
ordinances, neither have done after the 
ordinances of the nations that are 
round about you; 8therefore thus saith 
the Lord GOD: Behold, I, even I, am 
against thee, and I will execute 
judgments in the midst of thee in the 
sight of the nations. 9And I will do in 
thee that which I have not done, and 
whereunto I will not do any more the 
like, because of all thine abominations. 
10Therefore the fathers shall eat the 
sons in the midst of thee, and the sons 
shall eat their fathers; and I will 
execute judgments in thee, and the 
whole remnant of thee will I scatter 
unto all the winds. 11Wherefore, as I 
live, saith the Lord GOD, surely, 
because thou hast defiled My 
sanctuary with all thy detestable 
things, and with all thine 
abominations, therefore will I also 
diminish thee; neither shall Mine eye 
spare, and I also will have no pity. 12A 
third part of thee shall die with the 
pestilence, and with famine shall they 
be consumed in the midst of thee; and 
a third part shall fall by the sword 
round about thee; and a third part I 
will scatter unto all the winds, and will 
draw out a sword after them. 13Thus 
shall Mine anger spend itself, and I 
will satisfy My fury upon them, and I 
will be eased; and they shall know that 
I the LORD have spoken in My zeal, 
when I have spent My fury upon them. 
14Moreover I will make thee an 
amazement and a reproach, among the 
nations that are round about thee, in 
the sight of all that pass by. 15So it 
shall be a reproach and a taunt, an 
instruction and an astonishment, unto 
the nations that are round about thee, 
when I shall execute judgments in thee 
in anger and in fury, and in furious 
rebukes; I the LORD have spoken it; 
16when I shall send upon them the evil 
arrows of famine, that are for 
destruction, which I will send to 
destroy you; and I will increase the 
famine upon you, and will break your 
staff of bread; 17and I will send upon 
you famine and evil beasts, and they 
shall bereave thee; and pestilence and 
blood shall pass through thee; and I 
will bring the sword upon thee. I the 
LORD have spoken it.’ 

And the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 2’Son of man, 
set thy face toward the mountains of 
Israel, and prophesy against them, 3and 
say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the 
word of the Lord GOD: Thus saith the 
Lord GOD concerning the mountains 
and concerning the hills, concerning 
the ravines and concerning the valleys: 
6 




Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword 
upon you, and I will destroy your high 
places. 4And your altars shall become 
desolate, and your sun-images shall be 
broken; and I will cast down your slain 
men before your idols. 5And I will lay 
the carcasses of the children of Israel 
before their idols; and I will scatter 
your bones round about your altars. 6In 
all your dwelling-places the cities shall 
be laid waste, and the high places shall 
be desolate; that your altars may be 
laid waste and made desolate, and your 
idols may be broken and cease, and 
your sun-images may be hewn down, 
and your works may be blotted out. 
7And the slain shall fall in the midst of 
you, and ye shall know that I am the 
LORD. 8Yet will I leave a remnant, in 
that ye shall have some that escape the 
sword among the nations, when ye 
shall be scattered through the 
countries. 9And they that escape of you 
shall remember Me among the nations 
whither they shall be carried captives, 
how that I have been anguished with 
their straying heart, which hath 
departed from Me, and with their eyes, 
which are gone astray after their idols; 
and they shall loathe themselves in 
their own sight for the evils which they 
have committed in all their 
abominations. 10And they shall know 
that I am the LORD; I have not said in 
vain that I would do this evil unto 
them. 

11Thus saith the Lord GOD: Smite 
with thy hand, and stamp with thy 
foot, and say: Alas! because of all the 
evil abominations of the house of 
Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, 
by the famine, and by the pestilence. 
12He that is far off shall die of the 
pestilence; and he that is near shall fall 
by the sword; and he that remaineth 
and is besieged shall die by the 
famine; thus will I spend My fury 
upon them. 13And ye shall know that I 
am the LORD, when their slain men 
shall be among their idols round about 
their altars, upon every high hill, in all 
the tops of the mountains, and under 
every leafy tree, and under every thick 
terebinth, the place where they did 
offer sweet savour to all their idols. 
14And I will stretch out My hand upon 
them, and make the land desolate and 
waste, more than the wilderness of 
Diblah, throughout all their 
habitations; and they shall know that I 
am the LORD.’ 

Moreover the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’And 
thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord 
GOD concerning the land of Israel: An 
end! the end is come upon the four 
corners of the land. 3Now is the end 
upon thee, and I will send Mine anger 
upon thee, and will judge thee 
according to thy ways; and I will bring 
upon thee all thine abominations. 4And 
Mine eye shall not spare thee, neither 
will I have pity; but I will bring thy 
ways upon thee, and thine 
abominations shall be in the midst of 
thee; and ye shall know that I am the 
LORD. 
7 




5Thus saith the Lord GOD: An evil, a 
singular evil, behold, it cometh. 6An 
end is come, the end is come, it 
awaketh against thee; behold, it 
cometh. 7The turn is come unto thee, O 
inhabitant of the land; the time is 
come, the day of tumult is near, and 
not of joyful shouting upon the 
mountains. 8Now will I shortly pour 
out My fury upon thee, and spend 
Mine anger upon thee, and will judge 
thee according to thy ways; and I will 
bring upon thee all thine abominations. 
9And Mine eye shall not spare, neither 
will I have pity; I will bring upon thee 
according to thy ways, and thine 
abominations shall be in the midst of 
thee; and ye shall know that I the LORD 
do smite. 10Behold the day; behold, it 
cometh; the turn is come forth; the rod 
hath blossomed, arrogancy hath 
budded. 11Violence is risen up into a 
rod of wickedness; nought cometh 
from them, nor from their tumult, nor 
from their turmoil, neither is there 
eminency among them. 12The time is 
come, the day draweth near; let not the 
buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for 
wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. 
13For the seller shall not return to that 
which is sold, although they be yet 
alive; for the vision is touching the 
whole multitude thereof, which shall 
not return; neither shall any stand 
possessed of the iniquity of his life. 
14They have blown the horn, and have 
made all ready, but none goeth to the 
battle; for My wrath is upon all the 
multitude thereof. 15The sword is 
without, and the pestilence and the 
famine within; he that is in the field 
shall die with the sword, and he that is 
in the city, famine and pestilence shall 
devour him. 16But they that shall at all 
escape of them, shall be on the 
mountains like doves of the valleys, all 
of them moaning, every one in his 
iniquity. 17All hands shall be slack, and 
all knees shall drip with water. 18They 
shall also gird themselves with 
sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; 
and shame shall be upon all faces, and 
baldness upon all their heads. 19They 
shall cast their silver in the streets, and 
their gold shall be as an unclean thing; 
their silver and their gold shall not be 
able to deliver them in the day of the 
wrath of the LORD; they shall not 
satisfy their souls, neither fill their 
bowels; because it hath been the 
stumblingblock of their iniquity. 20And 
as for the beauty of their ornament, 
which was set for a pride, they made 
the images of their abominations and 
their detestable things thereof; 
therefore have I made it unto them as 
an unclean thing. 21And I will give it 
into the hands of the strangers for a 
prey, and to the wicked of the earth for 
a spoil; and they shall profane it. 22I 
will also turn My face from them, and 
they shall profane My secret place; 
and robbers shall enter into it, and 
profane it. 

23Make the chain; for the land is full 
of bloody crimes, and the city is full of 
violence. 24Wherefore I will bring the 
worst of the nations, and they shall 


possess their houses; I will also make 
the pride of the strong to cease; and 
their holy places shall be profaned. 
25Horror cometh; and they shall seek 
peace, and there shall be none. 
26Calamity shall come upon calamity, 
and rumour shall be upon rumour; and 
they shall seek a vision of the prophet, 
and instruction shall perish from the 
priest, and counsel from the elders. 
27The king shall mourn, and the prince 
shall be clothed with appalment, and 
the hands of the people of the land 
shall be enfeebled; I will do unto them 
after their way, and according to their 
deserts will I judge them; and they 
shall know that I am the LORD.’ 

And it came to pass in the sixth 
year, in the sixth month, in the 
fifth day of the month, as I sat in my 
house, and the elders of Judah sat 
before me, that the hand of the Lord 
GOD fell there upon me. 2Then I 
beheld, and lo a likeness as the 
appearance of fire: from the 
appearance of his loins and downward, 
fire; and from his loins and upward, as 
the appearance of brightness, as the 
colour of electrum. 3And the form of a 
hand was put forth, and I was taken by 
a lock of my head; and a spirit lifted 
me up between the earth and the 
heaven, and brought me in the visions 
of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the 
gate of the inner court that looketh 
toward the north; where was the seat 
of the image of jealousy, which 
provoketh to jealousy. 4And, behold, 
the glory of the God of Israel was 
there, according to the vision that I 
saw in the plain. 5Then said He unto 
me: ‘Son of man, lift up thine eyes 
now the way toward the north.’ So I 
lifted up mine eyes the way toward the 
north, and behold northward of the 
gate of the altar this image of jealousy 
in the entry. 

6And He said unto me: ‘Son of man, 
seest thou what they do? even the great 
abominations that the house of Israel 
do commit here, that I should go far 
off from My sanctuary? but thou shalt 
again see yet greater abominations.’ 
7And He brought me to the door of the 
court; and when I looked, behold a 
hole in the wall. 8Then said He unto 
me: ‘Son of man, dig now in the wall’; 
and when I had digged in the wall, 
behold a door. 9And He said unto me: 
‘Go in, and see the wicked 
abominations that they do here.’ 10So I 
went in and saw; and behold every 
detestable form of creeping things and 
beasts, and all the idols of the house of 
Israel, portrayed upon the wall round 
about. 11And there stood before them 
seventy men of the elders of the house 
of Israel, and in the midst of them 
stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, 
every man with his censer in his hand; 
and a thick cloud of incense went up. 
12Then said He unto me: ‘Son of man, 
hast thou seen what the elders of the 
house of Israel do in the dark, every 
man in his chambers of imagery? for 
they say: The LORD seeth us not, the 
LORD hath forsaken the land.’ 13He said 
also unto me: ‘Thou shalt again see yet 
8 




greater abominations which they do.’ 
14Then He brought me to the door of 
the gate of the LORD’S house which 
was toward the north; and, behold, 
there sat the women weeping for 
Tammuz. 15Then said He unto me: 
‘Hast thou seen this, O son of man? 
thou shalt again see yet greater 
abominations than these.’ 16And He 
brought me into the inner court of the 
LORD’S house, and, behold, at the door 
of the temple of the LORD, between the 
porch and the altar, were about five 
and twenty men, with their backs 
toward the temple of the LORD, and 
their faces toward the east; and they 
worshipped the sun toward the east. 
17Then He said unto me: ‘Hast thou 
seen this, O son of man? Is it a light 
thing to the house of Judah that they 
commit the abominations which they 
commit here in that they fill the land 
with violence, and provoke Me still 
more, and, lo, they put the branch to 
their nose? 18Therefore will I also deal 
in fury; Mine eye shall not spare, 
neither will I have pity; and though 
they cry in Mine ears with a loud 
voice, yet will I not hear them.’ 

Then he called in mine ears with a 
loud voice, saying: ‘Cause ye 
them that have charge over the city to 
draw near, every man with his 
destroying weapon in his hand.’ 2And, 
behold, six men came from the way of 
the upper gate, which lieth toward the 
north, every man with his weapon of 
destruction in his hand; and one man 
in the midst of them clothed in linen, 
with a writer’s inkhorn on his side. 
And they went in, and stood beside the 
brazen altar. 3And the glory of the God 
of Israel was gone up from the cherub, 
whereupon it was, to the threshold of 
the house; and He called to the man 
clothed in linen, who had the writer’s 
inkhorn on his side. 4And the LORD 
said unto him: ‘Go through the midst 
of the city, through the midst of 
Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the 
foreheads of the men that sigh and that 
cry for all the abominations that are 
done in the midst thereof.’ 5And to the 
others He said in my hearing: ‘Go ye 
through the city after him, and smite; 
let not your eye spare, neither have ye 
pity; 6slay utterly the old man, the 
young man and the maiden, and little 
children and women; but come not 
near any man upon whom is the mark; 
and begin at My sanctuary.’ Then they 
began at the elders that were before the 
house. 7And He said unto them: 
‘Defile the house, and fill the courts 
with the slain; go ye forth.’ And they 
went forth, and smote in the city. 8And 
it came to pass, while they were 
smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon 
my face, and cried, and said: ‘Ah Lord 
GOD! wilt Thou destroy all the residue 
of Israel in Thy pouring out of Thy 
fury upon Jerusalem?’ 9Then said He 
unto me: ‘The iniquity of the house of 
Israel and Judah is exceeding great, 
and the land is full of blood, and the 
city full of wresting of judgment; for 
they say: The LORD hath forsaken the 
land, and the LORD seeth not. 10And as 
9 




for Me also, Mine eye shall not spare, 
neither will I have pity, but I will bring 
their way upon their head.’ 11And, 
behold, the man clothed in linen, who 
had the inkhorn on his side, reported, 
saying: ‘I have done according to all 
that Thou hast commanded me.’ 

Then I looked, and, behold, 
upon the firmament that was 
over the head of the cherubim, there 
appeared above them as it were a 
sapphire stone, as the appearance of 
the likeness of a throne. 2And He 
spoke unto the man clothed in linen, 
and said: ‘Go in between the 
wheelwork, even under the cherub, 
and fill both thy hands with coals of 
fire from between the cherubim, and 
dash them against the city.’ And he 
went in in my sight. 3Now the 
cherubim stood on the right side of the 
house, when the man went in; and the 
cloud filled the inner court. 4And the 
glory of the LORD mounted up from the 
cherub to the threshold of the house; 
and the house was filled with the 
cloud, and the court was full of the 
brightness of the LORD’S glory. 5And 
the sound of the wings of the cherubim 
was heard even to the outer court, as 
the voice of God Almighty when He 
speaketh. 6And it came to pass, when 
He commanded the man clothed in 
linen, saying: ‘Take fire from between 
the wheelwork, from between the 
cherubim’, that he went in, and stood 
beside a wheel. 7And the cherub 
stretched forth his hand from between 
the cherubim unto the fire that was 
between the cherubim, and took 
thereof, and put it into the hands of 
him that was clothed in linen, who 
took it and went out. 8And there 
appeared in the cherubim the form of a 
man’s hand under their wings. 9And I 
looked, and behold four wheels beside 
the cherubim, one wheel beside one 
cherub, and another wheel beside 
another cherub; and the appearance of 
the wheels was as the colour of a beryl 
stone. 10And as for their appearance, 
they four had one likeness, as if a 
wheel had been within a wheel. 
11When they went, they went toward 
their four sides; they turned not as they 
went, but to the place whither the head 
looked they followed it; they turned 
not as they went. 12And their whole 
body, and their backs, and their hands, 
and their wings, and the wheels were 
full of eyes round about, even the 
wheels that they four had. 13As for the 
wheels, they were called in my hearing 
The wheelwork. 14And every one had 
four faces: the first face was the face 
of the cherub, and the second face was 
the face of a man, and the third the 
face of a lion, and the fourth the face 
of an eagle. 15And the cherubim 
mounted up—this is the living creature 
that I saw by the river Chebar. 16And 
when the cherubim went, the wheels 
went beside them; and when the 
cherubim lifted up their wings to 
mount up from the earth, the same 
wheels also turned not from beside 
them. 17When they stood, these stood, 
and when they mounted up, these 
10 




mounted up with them; for the spirit of 
the living creature was in them. 18And 
the glory of the LORD went forth from 
off the threshold of the house, and 
stood over the cherubim. 19And the 
cherubim lifted up their wings, and 
mounted up from the earth in my sight 
when they went forth, and the wheels 
beside them; and they stood at the door 
of the east gate of the LORD’S house; 
and the glory of the God of Israel was 
over them above. 20This is the living 
creature that I saw under the God of 
Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew 
that they were cherubim. 21Every one 
had four faces apiece, and every one 
four wings; and the likeness of the 
hands of a man was under their wings. 
22And as for the likeness of their faces, 
they were the faces which I saw by the 
river Chebar, their appearances and 
themselves; they went every one 
straight forward. 

Then a spirit lifted me up, and 
brought me unto the east gate 
of the LORD’S house, which looketh 
eastward; and behold at the door of the 
gate five and twenty men; and I saw in 
the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of 
Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of 
Benaiah, princes of the people. 2And 
He said unto me: ‘Son of man, these 
are the men that devise iniquity, and 
that give wicked counsel in this city; 
3that say: The time is not near to build 
houses! this city is the caldron, and we 
are the flesh. 4Therefore prophesy 
against them, prophesy, O son of 
man.’ 5And the spirit of the LORD fell 
upon me, and He said unto me: 
‘Speak: Thus saith the LORD: Thus 
have ye said, O house of Israel; for I 
know the things that come into your 
mind. 6Ye have multiplied your slain 
in this city, and ye have filled the 
streets thereof with the slain. 
7Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Your slain whom ye have laid in the 
midst of it, they are the flesh, and this 
city is the caldron; but ye shall be 
brought forth out of the midst of it. 
8Ye have feared the sword; and the 
sword will I bring upon you, saith the 
Lord GOD. 9And I will bring you forth 
out of the midst thereof, and deliver 
you into the hands of strangers, and 
will execute judgments among you. 
10Ye shall fall by the sword: I will 
judge you upon the border of Israel; 
and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
11Though this city shall not be your 
caldron, ye shall be the flesh in the 
midst thereof; I will judge you upon 
the border of Israel; 12and ye shall 
know that I am the LORD; for ye have 
not walked in My statutes, neither 
have ye executed Mine ordinances, but 
have done after the ordinances of the 
nations that are round about you.’ 
13And it came to pass, when I 
prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of 
Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon 
my face, and cried with a loud voice, 
and said: ‘Ah Lord GOD! wilt Thou 
make a full end of the remnant of 
Israel?’ 

14And the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 15’Son of man, as for 
11 




thy brethren, even thy brethren, the 
men of thy kindred, and all the house 
of Israel, all of them, concerning 
whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
have said: Get you far from the LORD! 
unto us is this land given for a 
possession; 16therefore say: Thus saith 
the Lord GOD: Although I have 
removed them far off among the 
nations, and although I have scattered 
them among the countries, yet have I 
been to them as a little sanctuary in the 
countries where they are come; 
17therefore say: Thus saith the Lord 
GOD: I will even gather you from the 
peoples, and assemble you out of the 
countries where ye have been 
scattered, and I will give you the land 
of Israel. 18And they shall come 
thither, and they shall take away all the 
detestable things thereof and all the 
abominations thereof from thence. 
19And I will give them one heart, and I 
will put a new spirit within you; and I 
will remove the stony heart out of their 
flesh, and will give them a heart of 
flesh; 20that they may walk in My 
statutes, and keep Mine ordinances, 
and do them; and they shall be My 
people, and I will be their God. 21But 
as for them whose heart walketh after 
the heart of their detestable things and 
their abominations, I will bring their 
way upon their own heads, saith the 
Lord GOD.’ 

22Then did the cherubim lift up their 
wings, and the wheels were beside 
them; and the glory of the God of 
Israel was over them above. 23And the 
glory of the LORD went up from the 
midst of the city, and stood upon the 
mountain which is on the east side of 
the city. 24And a spirit lifted me up, 
and brought me in the vision by the 
spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of 
the captivity. So the vision that I had 
seen went up from Me. 25Then I spoke 
unto them of the captivity all the 
things that the LORD had shown me. 

The word of the LORD also 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, thou dwellest in the midst of 
the rebellious house, that have eyes to 
see, and see not, that have ears to hear, 
and hear not; for they are a rebellious 
house. 3Therefore, thou son of man, 
prepare thee stuff for exile, and 
remove as though for exile by day in 
their sight; and thou shalt remove from 
thy place to another place in their 
sight; it may be they will perceive, for 
they are a rebellious house. 4And thou 
shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in 
their sight, as stuff for exile; and thou 
shalt go forth thyself at even in their 
sight, as when men go forth into exile. 
5Dig thou through the wall in their 
sight, and carry out thereby. 6In their 
sight shalt thou bear it upon thy 
shoulder, and carry it forth in the 
darkness; thou shalt cover thy face, 
that thou see not the ground; for I have 
set thee for a sign unto the house of 
Israel.’ 7And I did so as I was 
commanded: I brought forth my stuff 
by day, as stuff for exile, and in the 
even I digged through the wall with 
my hand; I carried out in the darkness, 
12 




and bore it upon my shoulder in their 
sight. 

8And in the morning came the word 
of the LORD unto me, saying: 9’Son of 
man, hath not the house of Israel, the 
rebellious house, said unto thee: What 
doest thou? 10Say thou unto them: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD: Concerning 
the prince, even this burden, in 
Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel 
among whom they are, 11say: I am 
your sign: like as I have done, so shall 
it be done unto them—they shall go 
into exile, into captivity. 12And the 
prince that is among them shall bear 
upon his shoulder, and go forth in the 
darkness; they shall dig through the 
wall to carry out thereby; he shall 
cover his face, that he see not the 
ground with his eyes. 13My net also 
will I spread upon him, and he shall be 
taken in My snare; and I will bring 
him to Babylon to the land of the 
Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, 
though he shall die there. 14And I will 
disperse toward every wind all that are 
round about him to help him, and all 
his troops; and I will draw out the 
sword after them. 15And they shall 
know that I am the LORD, when I shall 
scatter them among the nations, and 
disperse them in the countries. 16But I 
will leave a few men of them from the 
sword, from the famine, and from the 
pestilence; that they may declare all 
their abominations among the nations 
whither they come; and they shall 
know that I am the LORD.’ 

17Moreover the word of the LORD 
came to me, saying: 18’Son of man, eat 
thy bread with quaking, and drink thy 
water with trembling and with anxiety; 
19and say unto the people of the land: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning 
the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land 
of Israel. They shall eat their bread 
with anxiety, and drink their water 
with appalment, that her land may be 
desolate from all that is therein, 
because of the violence of all them that 
dwell therein. 20And the cities that are 
inhabited shall be laid waste, and the 
land shall be desolate; and ye shall 
know that I am the LORD.’ 

21And the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 22’Son of man, what 
is that proverb that ye have in the land 
of Israel, saying: The days are 
prolonged, and every vision faileth? 
23Tell them therefore: Thus saith the 
Lord GOD: I will make this proverb to 
cease, and they shall no more use it as 
a proverb in Israel; but say unto them: 
The days are at hand, and the word of 
every vision. 24For there shall be no 
more any vain vision nor smooth 
divination within the house of Israel. 
25For I am the LORD; I will speak, what 
word soever it be that I shall speak, 
and it shall be performed; it shall be no 
more delayed; for in your days, O 
rebellious house, will I speak the 
word, and will perform it, saith the 
Lord GOD.’ 

26Again the word of the LORD came 
to me, saying: 27’Son of man, behold, 
they of the house of Israel say: The 


vision that he seeth is for many days to 
come, and he prophesieth of times that 
are far off. 28Therefore say unto them: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD: There shall 
none of My words be delayed any 
more, but the word which I shall speak 
shall be performed, saith the Lord 
GOD.’ 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, prophesy against the prophets 
of Israel that prophesy, and say thou 
unto them that prophesy out of their 
own heart: Hear ye the word of the 
LORD: 3Thus saith the Lord GOD: Woe 
unto the vile prophets, that follow their 
own spirit, and things which they have 
not seen! 4O Israel, thy prophets have 
been like foxes in ruins. 5Ye have not 
gone up into the breaches, neither 
made up the hedge for the house of 
Israel, to stand in the battle in the day 
of the LORD. 6They have seen vanity 
and lying divination, that say: The 
LORD saith; and the LORD hath not sent 
them, yet they hope that the word 
would be confirmed! 7Have ye not 
seen a vain vision, and have ye not 
spoken a lying divination, whereas ye 
say: The LORD saith; albeit I have not 
spoken? 

8Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Because ye have spoken vanity, and 
seen lies, therefore, behold, I am 
against you, saith the Lord GOD. 9And 
My hand shall be against the prophets 
that see vanity, and that divine lies; 
they shall not be in the council of My 
people, neither shall they be written in 
the register of the house of Israel, 
neither shall they enter into the land of 
Israel; and ye shall know that I am the 
Lord GOD. 10Because, even because 
they have led My people astray, 
saying: Peace, and there is no peace; 
and when it buildeth up a slight wall, 
behold, they daub it with whited 
plaster; 11say unto them that daub it 
with whited plaster, that it shall fall; 
there shall be an overflowing shower, 
and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall, 
and a stormy wind shall break forth, 
12and, lo, when the wall is fallen, shall 
it not be said unto you: Where is the 
daubing wherewith ye have daubed it? 
13Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: I 
will even cause a stormy wind to break 
forth in My fury; and there shall be an 
overflowing shower in Mine anger, 
and great hailstones in fury to 
consume it. 14So will I break down the 
wall that ye have daubed with whited 
plaster, and bring it down to the 
ground, so that the foundation thereof 
shall be uncovered; and it shall fall, 
and ye shall be consumed in the midst 
thereof; and ye shall know that I am 
the LORD. 15Thus will I spend My fury 
upon the wall, and upon them that 
have daubed it with whited plaster; 
and I will say unto you: The wall is no 
more, neither they that daubed it; 16to 
wit, the prophets of Israel that 
prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and 
that see visions of peace for her, and 
there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD. 

17And thou, son of man, set thy face 
against the daughters of thy people, 
13 




that prophesy out of their own heart; 
and prophesy thou against them, 18and 
say: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Woe to 
the women that sew cushions upon all 
elbows, and make pads for the head of 
persons of every stature to hunt souls! 
Will ye hunt the souls of My people, 
and save souls alive for yourselves? 
19And ye have profaned Me among My 
people for handfuls of barley and for 
crumbs of bread, to slay the souls that 
should not die, and to save the souls 
alive that should not live, by your 
lying to My people that hearken unto 
lies. 20Wherefore thus saith the Lord 
GOD: Behold, I am against your 
cushions, wherewith ye hunt the souls 
as birds, and I will tear them from your 
arms; and I will let the souls go, even 
the souls that ye hunt as birds. 21Your 
pads also will I tear, and deliver My 
people out of your hand, and they shall 
be no more in your hand to be hunted; 
and ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
22Because with lies ye have cowed the 
heart of the righteous, when I have not 
grieved him; and strengthened the 
hands of the wicked, that he should not 
return from his wicked way, that he be 
saved alive; 23therefore ye shall no 
more see vanity, nor divine 
divinations; and I will deliver My 
people out of your hand; and ye shall 
know that I am the LORD.’ 

Then came certain of the 
elders of Israel unto me, and 
sat before me. 2And the word of the 
LORD came unto me, saying: 3’Son of 
man, these men have set up their idols 
in their mind, and put the 
stumblingblock of their iniquity before 
their face; should I be inquired of at all 
by them? 4Therefore speak unto them, 
and say unto them: Thus saith the Lord 
GOD: Every man of the house of Israel 
that setteth up his idols in his mind, 
and putteth the stumblingblock of his 
iniquity before his face, and cometh to 
the prophet—I the LORD will answer 
him that cometh according to the 
multitude of his idols; 5that I may take 
the house of Israel in their own heart, 
because they are all turned away from 
Me through their idols. 

6Therefore say unto the house of 
Israel: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Return 
ye, and turn yourselves from your 
idols; and turn away your faces from 
all your abominations. 7For every one 
of the house of Israel, or of the 
strangers that sojourn in Israel, that 
separateth himself from Me, and 
taketh his idols into his heart, and 
putteth the stumblingblock of his 
iniquity before his face, and cometh to 
the prophet, that he inquire for him of 
Me—I the LORD will answer him by 
Myself, 8and I will set My face against 
that man, and will make him a sign 
and a proverb, and I will cut him off 
from the midst of My people; and ye 
shall know that I am the LORD. 9And 
when the prophet is enticed and 
speaketh a word, I the LORD have 
enticed that prophet, and I will stretch 
out My hand upon him, and will 
destroy him from the midst of My 
people Israel. 10And they shall bear 
14 




their iniquity; the iniquity of the 
prophet shall be even as the iniquity of 
him that inquireth; 11that the house of 
Israel may go no more astray from Me, 
neither defile themselves any more 
with all their transgressions; but that 
they may be My people, and I may be 
their God, saith the Lord GOD.’ 

12And the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 13’Son of man, when 
a land sinneth against Me by 
trespassing grievously, and I stretch 
out My hand upon it, and break the 
staff of the bread thereof, and send 
famine upon it, and cut off from it man 
and beast; 14though these three men, 
Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they 
should deliver but their own souls by 
their righteousness, saith the Lord 
GOD. 15If I cause evil beasts to pass 
through the land, and they bereave it, 
and it be desolate, so that no man may 
pass through because of the beasts; 
16though these three men were in it, as 
I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall 
deliver neither sons nor daughters; 
they only shall be delivered, but the 
land shall be desolate. 17Or if I bring a 
sword upon that land, and say: Let the 
sword go through the land, so that I cut 
off from it man and beast; 18though 
these three men were in it, as I live, 
saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver 
neither sons nor daughters, but they 
only shall be delivered themselves. 
19Or if I send a pestilence into that 
land, and pour out My fury upon it in 
blood, to cut off from it man and beast; 
20though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were 
in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they 
shall deliver neither son nor daughter; 
they shall but deliver their own souls 
by their righteousness. 21For thus saith 
the Lord GOD: How much more when I 
send My four sore judgments against 
Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, 
and the evil beasts, and the pestilence, 
to cut off from it man and beast. 
22And, behold, though there be left a 
remnant therein that shall be brought 
forth, both sons and daughters; behold, 
when they come forth unto you, and ye 
see their way and their doings, then ye 
shall be comforted concerning the evil 
that I have brought upon Jerusalem, 
even concerning all that I have brought 
upon it; 23and they shall comfort you, 
when ye see their way and their 
doings, and ye shall know that I have 
not done without cause all that I have 
done in it, saith the Lord GOD.’ 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, what is the vine-tree more 
than any tree, the vine branch which 
grew up among the trees of the forest? 
3Shall wood be taken thereof to make 
any work? or will men take a pin of it 
to hang any vessel thereon? 4Behold, it 
is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire 
hath devoured both the ends of it, and 
the midst of it is singed; is it profitable 
for any work? 5Behold, when it was 
whole, it was meet for no work; how 
much less, when the fire hath devoured 
it, and it is singed, shall it yet be meet 
for any work? 6Therefore thus saith the 
Lord GOD: As the vine-tree among the 
15 




trees of the forest, which I have given 
to the fire for fuel, so do I give the 
inhabitants of Jerusalem. 7And I will 
set My face against them; out of the 
fire are they come forth, and the fire 
shall devour them; and ye shall know 
that I am the LORD, when I set My face 
against them. 8And I will make the 
land desolate, because they have acted 
treacherously, saith the Lord GOD.’ 

Again the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, cause Jerusalem to know her 
abominations, 3and say: Thus saith the 
Lord GOD unto Jerusalem: Thine origin 
and thy nativity is of the land of the 
Canaanite; the Amorite was thy father, 
and thy mother was a Hittite. 4And as 
for thy nativity, in the day thou wast 
born thy navel was not cut, neither 
wast thou washed in water for 
cleansing; thou was not salted at all, 
nor swaddled at all. 5No eye pitied 
thee, to do any of these unto thee, to 
have compassion upon thee; but thou 
wast cast out in the open field in the 
loathsomeness of thy person, in the 
day that thou wast born. 

6And when I passed by thee, and 
saw thee wallowing in thy blood, I 
said unto thee: In thy blood, live; yea, 
I said unto thee: In thy blood, live; 7I 
cause thee to increase, even as the 
growth of the field. And thou didst 
increase and grow up, and thou camest 
to excellent beauty: thy breasts were 
fashioned, and thy hair was grown; yet 
thou wast naked and bare. 8Now when 
I passed by thee, and looked upon 
thee, and, behold, thy time was the 
time of love, I spread my skirt over 
thee, and covered thy nakedness; yea, I 
swore unto thee, and entered into a 
covenant with thee, saith the Lord 
GOD, and thou becamest Mine. 9Then 
washed I thee with water; yea, I 
cleansed away thy blood from thee, 
and I anointed thee with oil. 10I clothed 
thee also with richly woven work, and 
shod thee with sealskin, and I wound 
fine linen about thy head, and covered 
thee with silk. 11I decked thee also 
with ornaments, and I put bracelets 
upon thy hands, and a chain on thy 
neck. 12And I put a ring upon thy nose, 
and earrings in thine ears, and a 
beautiful crown upon thy head. 13Thus 
wast thou decked with gold and silver; 
and thy raiment was of fine linen, and 
silk, and richly woven work; thou didst 
eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and 
thou didst wax exceeding beautiful, 
and thou wast meet for royal estate. 
14And thy renown went forth among 
the nations for thy beauty; for it was 
perfect, through My splendour which I 
had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD. 

15But thou didst trust in thy beauty 
and play the harlot because of thy 
renown, and didst pour out thy 
harlotries on every one that passed by; 
his it was. 16And thou didst take of thy 
garments, and didst make for thee high 
places decked with divers colours, and 
didst play the harlot upon them; the 
like things shall not come, neither shall 
it be so. 17Thou didst also take thy fair 
jewels of My gold and of My silver, 
16 




which I had given thee, and madest for 
thee images of men, and didst play the 
harlot with them; 18and thou didst take 
thy richly woven garments and cover 
them, and didst set Mine oil and Mine 
incense before them. 19My bread also 
which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, 
and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou 
didst even set it before them for a 
sweet savour, and thus it was; saith the 
Lord GOD. 20Moreover thou hast taken 
thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou 
hast borne unto Me, and these hast 
thou sacrificed unto them to be 
devoured. Were thy harlotries a small 
matter, 21that thou hast slain My 
children, and delivered them up, in 
setting them apart unto them? 22And in 
all thine abominations and thy 
harlotries thou hast not remembered 
the days of thy youth, when thou wast 
naked and bare, and wast wallowing in 
thy blood. 23And it came to pass after 
all thy wickedness—woe, woe unto 
thee! saith the Lord GOD— 24that thou 
hast built unto thee an eminent place, 
and hast made thee a lofty place in 
every street. 25Thou hast built thy lofty 
place at every head of the way, and 
hast made thy beauty an abomination, 
and hast opened thy feet to every one 
that passed by, and multiplied thy 
harlotries. 26Thou hast also played the 
harlot with the Egyptians, thy 
neighbours, great of flesh; and hast 
multiplied thy harlotry, to provoke Me. 
27Behold, therefore I have stretched 
out My hand over thee, and have 
diminished thine allowance, and 
delivered thee unto the will of them 
that hate thee, the daughters of the 
Philistines, that are ashamed of thy 
lewd way. 28Thou hast played the 
harlot also with the Assyrians, without 
having enough; yea, thou hast played 
the harlot with them, and yet thou wast 
not satisfied. 29Thou hast moreover 
multiplied thy harlotry with the land of 
traffic, even with Chaldea; and yet 
thou didst not have enough herewith. 
30How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord 
GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, 
the work of a wanton harlot; 31in that 
thou buildest thine eminent place in 
the head of every way, and makest thy 
lofty place in every street; and hast not 
been as a harlot that enhanceth her 
hire. 32Thou wife that committest 
adultery, that takest strangers instead 
of thy husband— 33to all harlots gifts 
are given; but thou hast given thy gifts 
to all thy lovers, and hast bribed them 
to come unto thee from every side in 
thy harlotries. 34And the contrary is in 
thee from other women, in that thou 
didst solicit to harlotry, and wast not 
solicited; and in that thou givest hire, 
and no hire is given unto thee, thus 
thou art contrary. 

35Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word 
of the LORD! 36Thus saith the Lord 
GOD: Because thy filthiness was 
poured out, and thy nakedness 
uncovered through thy harlotries with 
thy lovers; and because of all the idols 
of thy abominations, and for the blood 
of thy children, that thou didst give 
unto them; 37therefore behold, I will 


gather all thy lovers, unto whom thou 
hast been pleasant, and all them that 
thou hast loved, with all them that thou 
hast hated; I will even gather them 
against thee from every side, and will 
uncover thy nakedness unto them, that 
they may see all thy nakedness. 38And 
I will judge thee, as women that break 
wedlock and shed blood are judged; 
and I will bring upon thee the blood of 
fury and jealousy. 39I will also give 
thee into their hand, and they shall 
throw down thine eminent place, and 
break down thy lofty places; and they 
shall strip thee of thy clothes, and take 
thy fair jewels; and they shall leave 
thee naked and bare. 40They shall also 
bring up an assembly against thee, and 
they shall stone thee with stones, and 
thrust thee through with their swords. 
41And they shall burn thy houses with 
fire, and execute judgments upon thee 
in the sight of many women; and I will 
cause thee to cease from playing the 
harlot, and thou shalt also give no hire 
any more. 42So will I satisfy My fury 
upon thee, and My jealousy shall 
depart from thee, and I will be quiet, 
and will be no more angry. 43Because 
thou hast not remembered the days of 
thy youth, but hast fretted Me in all 
these things; lo, therefore I also will 
bring thy way upon thy head, saith the 
Lord GOD; or hast thou not committed 
this lewdness above all thine 
abominations? 

44Behold, every one that useth 
proverbs shall use this proverb against 
thee, saying: As the mother, so her 
daughter. 45Thou art thy mother’s 
daughter, that loatheth her husband 
and her children; and thou art the sister 
of thy sisters, who loathed their 
husbands and their children; your 
mother was a Hittite, and your father 
an Amorite. 46And thine elder sister is 
Samaria, that dwelleth at thy left hand, 
she and her daughters; and thy 
younger sister, that dwelleth at thy 
right hand, is Sodom and her 
daughters. 47Yet hast thou not walked 
in their ways, nor done after their 
abominations; but in a very little while 
thou didst deal more corruptly than 
they in all thy ways. 48As I live, saith 
the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath 
not done, she nor her daughters, as 
thou hast done, thou and thy 
daughters. 49Behold, this was the 
iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, 
fulness of bread, and careless ease was 
in her and in her daughters; neither did 
she strengthen the hand of the poor 
and needy. 50And they were haughty, 
and committed abomination before 
Me; therefore I removed them when I 
saw it. 51Neither hath Samaria 
committed even half of thy sins; but 
thou hast multiplied thine 
abominations more than they, and hast 
justified thy sisters by all thine 
abominations which thou hast done. 
52Thou also, bear thine own shame, in 
that thou hast given judgment for thy 
sisters; through thy sins that thou hast 
committed more abominable than they, 
they are more righteous than thou; yea, 
be thou also confounded, and bear thy 


shame, in that thou hast justified thy 
sisters. 

53And I will turn their captivity, the 
captivity of Sodom and her daughters, 
and the captivity of Samaria and her 
daughters, and the captivity of thy 
captives in the midst of them; 54that 
thou mayest bear thine own shame, 
and mayest be ashamed because of all 
that thou hast done, in that thou art a 
comfort unto them. 55And thy sisters, 
Sodom and her daughters, shall return 
to their former estate, and Samaria and 
her daughters shall return to their 
former estate, and thou and thy 
daughters shall return to your former 
estate. 56For thy sister Sodom was not 
mentioned by thy mouth in the day of 
thy pride; 57before thy wickedness was 
uncovered, as at the time of the taunt 
of the daughters of Aram, and of all 
that are round about her, the daughters 
of the Philistines, that have thee in 
disdain round about. 58Thou hast borne 
thy lewdness and thine abominations, 
saith the LORD. 

59For thus saith the Lord GOD: I will 
even deal with thee as thou hast done, 
who hast despised the oath in breaking 
the covenant. 60Nevertheless I will 
remember My covenant with thee in 
the days of thy youth, and I will 
establish unto thee an everlasting 
covenant. 61Then shalt thou remember 
thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou 
shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder 
sisters and thy younger; and I will give 
them unto thee for daughters, but not 
because of thy covenant. 62And I will 
establish My covenant with thee, and 
thou shalt know that I am the LORD; 
63that thou mayest remember, and be 
confounded, and never open thy mouth 
any more, because of thy shame; when 
I have forgiven thee all that thou hast 
done, saith the Lord GOD.’ 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a 
parable unto the house of Israel, 3and 
say: Thus saith the Lord GOD: 

A great eagle with great wings 

And long pinions, 

Full of feathers, which had divers 
colours, 

Came unto Lebanon, 

And took the top of the cedar; 

4He cropped off the topmost of the 
young twigs thereof, 

And carried it into a land of traffic; 

He set it in a city of merchants. 

5He took also of the seed of the 
land, 

And planted it in a fruitful soil; 

He placed it beside many waters, 

He set it as a slip. 

6And it grew, and became a 
spreading vine 

Of low stature, 

Whose tendrils might turn toward 
him, 

And the roots thereof be under him; 

So it became a vine, and brought 
forth branches, 

And shot forth sprigs. 

 

7There was also another great eagle 
with great wings 
17 




And many feathers; 

And, behold, this vine did bend 

Its roots toward him, 

And shot forth its branches toward 
him, from the beds of its 
plantation, 

That he might water it. 

8It was planted in a good soil 

By many waters, 

That it might bring forth branches, 
and that it might bear fruit, 

That it might be a stately vine. 

9Say thou: Thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Shall it prosper? 

Shall he not pull up the roots 
thereof, 

And cut off the fruit thereof, that it 
wither, 

Yea, wither in all its sprouting 
leaves? 

Neither shall great power or much 
people be at hand 

When it is plucked up by the roots 
thereof. 

10Yea, behold, being planted, shall it 
prosper? 

Shall it not utterly wither, when the 
east wind toucheth it? 

In the beds where it grew it shall 
wither.’ 

11Moreover the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 12’Say now to 
the rebellious house: Know ye not 
what these things mean? tell them: 
Behold, the king of Babylon came to 
Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, 
and the princes thereof, and brought 
them to him to Babylon; 13and he took 
of the seed royal, and made a covenant 
with him, and brought him under an 
oath, and the mighty of the land he 
took away; 14that his might be a lowly 
kingdom, that it might not lift itself up, 
but that by keeping his covenant it 
might stand. 15But he rebelled against 
him in sending his ambassadors into 
Egypt, that they might give him horses 
and much people. Shall he prosper? 
shall he escape that doeth such things? 
shall he break the covenant, and yet 
escape? 16As I live, saith the Lord GOD, 
surely in the place where the king 
dwelleth that made him king, whose 
oath he despised, and whose covenant 
he broke, even with him in the midst 
of Babylon he shall die. 17Neither shall 
Pharaoh with his mighty army and 
great company succour him in the war, 
when they cast up mounds and build 
forts, to cut off many souls; 18seeing he 
hath despised the oath by breaking the 
covenant, when, lo, he had given his 
hand, and hath done all these things, 
he shall not escape. 19Therefore thus 
saith the Lord GOD: As I live, surely 
Mine oath that he hath despised, and 
My covenant that he hath broken, I 
will even bring it upon his own head. 
20And I will spread My net upon him, 
and he shall be taken in My snare, and 
I will bring him to Babylon, and will 
plead with him there for his treachery 
that he hath committed against Me. 
21And all his mighty men in all his 
bands shall fall by the sword, and they 
that remain shall be scattered toward 
every wind; and ye shall know that I 
the LORD have spoken it. 22Thus saith 


the Lord GOD: Moreover I will take, 
even I, of the lofty top of the cedar, 
and will set it; I will crop off from the 
topmost of its young twigs a tender 
one, and I will plant it upon a high 
mountain and eminent; 23in the 
mountain of the height of Israel will I 
plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, 
and bear fruit, and be a stately cedar; 
and under it shall dwell all fowl of 
every wing, in the shadow of the 
branches thereof shall they dwell. 
24And all the trees of the field shall 
know that I the LORD have brought 
down the high tree, have exalted the 
low tree, have dried up the green tree, 
and have made the dry tree to flourish; 
I the LORD have spoken and have done 
it.’ 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’What 
mean ye, that ye use this proverb in the 
land of Israel, saying: 

The fathers have eaten sour grapes, 

And the children’s teeth are set on 
edge? 

3As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall 
not have occasion any more to use this 
proverb in Israel. 4Behold, all souls are 
Mine; as the soul of the father, so also 
the soul of the son is Mine; the soul 
that sinneth, it shall die. 

5But if a man be just, and do that 
which is lawful and right, 6and hath 
not eaten upon the mountains, neither 
hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of 
the house of Israel, neither hath defiled 
his neighbour’s wife, neither hath 
come near to a woman in her impurity; 
7and hath not wronged any, but hath 
restored his pledge for a debt, hath 
taken nought by robbery, hath given 
his bread to the hungry, and hath 
covered the naked with a garment; 8he 
that hath not given forth upon interest, 
neither hath taken any increase, that 
hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, 
hath executed true justice between 
man and man, 9hath walked in My 
statutes, and hath kept Mine 
ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he 
shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD. 

10If he beget a son that is a robber, a 
shedder of blood, and that doeth to a 
brother any of these things, 11whereas 
he himself had not done any of these 
things, for he hath even eaten upon the 
mountains, and defiled his neighbour’s 
wife, 12hath wronged the poor and 
needy, hath taken by robbery, hath not 
restored the pledge, and hath lifted up 
his eyes to the idols, hath committed 
abomination, 13hath given forth upon 
interest, and hath taken increase; shall 
he then live? he shall not live—he hath 
done all these abominations; he shall 
surely be put to death, his blood shall 
be upon him. 

14Now, lo, if he beget a son, that 
seeth all his father’s sins, which he 
hath done, and considereth, and doeth 
not such like, 15that hath not eaten 
upon the mountains, neither hath lifted 
up his eyes to the idols of the house of 
Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour’s 
wife, 16neither hath wronged any, hath 
not taken aught to pledge, neither hath 
taken by robbery, but hath given his 
18 




bread to the hungry, and hath covered 
the naked with a garment, 17that hath 
withdrawn his hand from the poor, that 
hath not received interest nor increase, 
hath executed Mine ordinances, hath 
walked in My statutes; he shall not die 
for the iniquity of his father, he shall 
surely live. 18As for his father, because 
he cruelly oppressed, committed 
robbery on his brother, and did that 
which is not good among his people, 
behold, he dieth for his iniquity. 19Yet 
say ye: Why doth not the son bear the 
iniquity of the father with him? When 
the son hath done that which is lawful 
and right, and hath kept all My 
statutes, and hath done them, he shall 
surely live. 20The soul that sinneth, it 
shall die; the son shall not bear the 
iniquity of the father with him, neither 
shall the father bear the iniquity of the 
son with him; the righteousness of the 
righteous shall be upon him, and the 
wickedness of the wicked shall be 
upon him. 

21But if the wicked turn from all his 
sins that he hath committed, and keep 
all My statutes, and do that which is 
lawful and right, he shall surely live, 
he shall not die. 22None of his 
transgressions that he hath committed 
shall be remembered against him; for 
his righteousness that he hath done he 
shall live. 23Have I any pleasure at all 
that the wicked should die? saith the 
Lord GOD; and not rather that he 
should return from his ways, and live? 

24But when the righteous turneth 
away from his righteousness, and 
committeth iniquity, and doeth 
according to all the abominations that 
the wicked man doeth, shall he live? 
None of his righteous deeds that he 
hath done shall be remembered; for his 
trespass that he trespassed, and for his 
sin that he hath sinned, for them shall 
he die. 25Yet ye say: The way of the 
Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house 
of Israel: Is it My way that is not 
equal? is it not your ways that are 
unequal? 26When the righteous man 
turneth away from his righteousness, 
and committeth iniquity, he shall die 
therefor; for his iniquity that he hath 
done shall he die. 27Again, when the 
wicked man turneth away from his 
wickedness that he hath committed, 
and doeth that which is lawful and 
right, he shall save his soul alive. 
28Because he considereth, and turneth 
away from all his transgressions that 
he hath committed, he shall surely 
live, he shall not die. 29Yet saith the 
house of Israel: The way of the Lord is 
not equal. O house of Israel, is it My 
ways that are not equal? is it not your 
ways that are unequal? 30Therefore I 
will judge you, O house of Israel, 
every one according to his ways, saith 
the Lord GOD. Return ye, and turn 
yourselves from all your 
transgressions; so shall they not be a 
stumblingblock of iniquity unto you. 
31Cast away from you all your 
transgressions, wherein ye have 
transgressed; and make you a new 
heart and a new spirit; for why will ye 
die, O house of Israel? 32For I have no 


pleasure in the death of him that dieth, 
saith the Lord GOD; wherefore turn 
yourselves, and live. 

Moreover, take thou up a 
lamentation for the princes of 
Israel, 2and say: 

How was thy mother a lioness; 

Among lions she couched, 

In the midst of the young lions 

She reared her whelps! 

3And she brought up one of her 
whelps, 

He became a young lion; 

And he learned to catch the prey, 

He devoured men. 

4Then the nations assembled against 
him, 

He was taken in their pit; 

And they brought him with hooks 

Unto the land of Egypt. 

 

5Now when she saw that she was 
disappointed, 

And her hope was lost, 

Then she took another of her 
whelps, 

And made him a young lion. 

6And he went up and down among 
the lions, 

He became a young lion; 

And he learned to catch the prey, 

He devoured men. 

7And he knew their castles, 

And laid waste their cities; 

And the land was desolate, 

And the fulness thereof, 

Because of the noise of his roaring. 

 

8Then the nations cried out against 
him 

On every side from the provinces; 

And they spread their net over him, 

He was taken in their pit. 

9And they put him in a cage with 
hooks, 

And brought him to the king of 
Babylon; 

That they might bring him into 
strongholds, 

So that his voice should no more be 
heard 

Upon the mountains of Israel. 

 

10Thy mother was like a vine, in thy 
likeness, 

Planted by the waters; 

She was fruitful and full of branches 

By reason of many waters. 

11And she had strong rods 

To be sceptres for them that bore 
rule; 

And her stature was exalted 

Among the thick branches, 

And she was seen in her height 

With the multitude of her tendrils. 

12But she was plucked up in fury, 

She was cast down to the ground, 

And the east wind dried up her fruit; 

Her strong rods were broken off and 
withered, 

The fire consumed her. 

13And now she is planted in the 
wilderness, 

In a dry and thirsty ground. 

14And fire is gone out of the rod of 
her branches, 

It hath devoured her fruit, 
19 




So that there is in her no strong rod 

To be a sceptre to rule.’ 

This is a lamentation, and it was for a 
lamentation. 

And it came to pass in the 
seventh year, in the fifth 
month, the tenth day of the month, that 
certain of the elders of Israel came to 
inquire of the LORD, and sat before me. 
2And the word of the LORD came unto 
me, saying: 3’Son of man, speak unto 
the elders of Israel, and say unto them: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD: Are ye come 
to inquire of Me? As I live, saith the 
Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by 
you. 4Wilt thou judge them, son of 
man, wilt thou judge them? cause them 
to know the abominations of their 
fathers; 5and say unto them: Thus saith 
the Lord GOD: In the day when I chose 
Israel, and lifted up My hand unto the 
seed of the house of Jacob, and made 
Myself known unto them in the land of 
Egypt, when I lifted up My hand unto 
them, saying: I am the LORD your God; 
6in that day I lifted up My hand unto 
them, to bring them forth out of the 
land of Egypt into a land that I had 
sought out for them, flowing with milk 
and honey, which is the beauty of all 
lands; 7and I said unto them: Cast ye 
away every man the detestable things 
of his eyes, and defile not yourselves 
with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD 
your God. 8But they rebelled against 
Me, and would not hearken unto Me; 
they did not every man cast away the 
detestable things of their eyes, neither 
did they forsake the idols of Egypt; 
then I said I would pour out My fury 
upon them, to spend My anger upon 
them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 
9But I wrought for My name’s sake, 
that it should not be profaned in the 
sight of the nations, among whom they 
were, in whose sight I made Myself 
known unto them, so as to bring them 
forth out of the land of Egypt. 10So I 
caused them to go forth out of the land 
of Egypt, and brought them into the 
wilderness. 11And I gave them My 
statutes, and taught them Mine 
ordinances, which if a man do, he shall 
live by them. 12Moreover also I gave 
them My sabbaths, to be a sign 
between Me and them, that they might 
know that I am the LORD that sanctify 
them. 13But the house of Israel rebelled 
against Me in the wilderness; they 
walked not in My statutes, and they 
rejected Mine ordinances, which if a 
man do, he shall live by them, and My 
sabbaths they greatly profaned; then I 
said I would pour out My fury upon 
them in the wilderness, to consume 
them. 14But I wrought for My name’s 
sake, that it should not be profaned in 
the sight of the nations, in whose sight 
I brought them out. 15Yet also I lifted 
up My hand unto them in the 
wilderness, that I would not bring 
them into the land which I had given 
them, flowing with milk and honey, 
which is the beauty of all lands; 
16because they rejected Mine 
ordinances, and walked not in My 
statutes, and profaned My sabbaths—
for their heart went after their idols. 
20 




17Nevertheless Mine eye spared them 
from destroying them, neither did I 
make a full end of them in the 
wilderness. 18And I said unto their 
children in the wilderness: Walk ye 
not in the statutes of your fathers, 
neither observe their ordinances, nor 
defile yourselves with their idols; 19I 
am the LORD your God; walk in My 
statutes, and keep Mine ordinances, 
and do them; 20and hallow My 
sabbaths, and they shall be a sign 
between Me and you, that ye may 
know that I am the LORD your God. 
21But the children rebelled against Me; 
they walked not in My statutes, neither 
kept Mine ordinances to do them, 
which if a man do, he shall live by 
them; they profaned My sabbaths; then 
I said I would pour out My fury upon 
them, to spend My anger upon them in 
the wilderness. 22Nevertheless I 
withdrew My hand, and wrought for 
My name’s sake, that it should not be 
profaned in the sight of the nations, in 
whose sight I brought them forth. 23I 
lifted up My hand unto them also in 
the wilderness, that I would scatter 
them among the nations, and disperse 
them through the countries; 24because 
they had not executed Mine 
ordinances, but had rejected My 
statutes, and had profaned My 
sabbaths, and their eyes were after 
their fathers’idols. 25Wherefore I gave 
them also statutes that were not good, 
and ordinances whereby they should 
not live; 26and I polluted them in their 
own gifts, in that they set apart all that 
openeth the womb, that I might 
destroy them, to the end that they 
might know that I am the LORD. 
27Therefore, son of man, speak unto 
the house of Israel, and say unto them: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD: In this 
moreover have your fathers 
blasphemed Me, in that they dealt 
treacherously with Me. 28For when I 
had brought them into the land, which 
I lifted up My hand to give unto them, 
then they saw every high hill, and 
every thick tree, and they offered there 
their sacrifices, and there they 
presented the provocation of their 
offering, there also they made their 
sweet savour, and there they poured 
out their drink-offerings. 29Then I said 
unto them: What meaneth the high 
place whereunto ye go? So the name 
thereof is called Bamah unto this day. 

30Wherefore say unto the house of 
Israel: Thus saith the Lord GOD: When 
ye pollute yourselves after the manner 
of your fathers, and go after their 
abominations, 31and when, in offering 
your gifts, in making your sons to pass 
through the fire, ye pollute yourselves 
with all your idols, unto this day; shall 
I then be inquired of by you, O house 
of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, 
I will not be inquired of by you; 32and 
that which cometh into your mind 
shall not be at all; in that ye say: We 
will be as the nations, as the families 
of the countries, to serve wood and 
stone. 33As I live, saith the Lord GOD, 
surely with a mighty hand, and with an 
outstretched arm, and with fury poured 


out, will I be king over you; 34and I 
will bring you out from the peoples, 
and will gather you out of the 
countries wherein ye are scattered, 
with a mighty hand, and with an 
outstretched arm, and with fury poured 
out; 35and I will bring you into the 
wilderness of the peoples, and there 
will I plead with you face to face. 
36Like as I pleaded with your fathers in 
the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so 
will I plead with you, saith the Lord 
GOD. 37And I will cause you to pass 
under the rod, and I will bring you into 
the bond of the covenant; 38and I will 
purge out from among you the rebels, 
and them that transgress against Me; I 
will bring them forth out of the land 
where they sojourn, but they shall not 
enter into the land of Israel; and ye 
shall know that I am the LORD. 39As for 
you, O house of Israel, thus saith the 
Lord GOD: Go ye, serve every one his 
idols, even because ye will not hearken 
unto Me; but My holy name shall ye 
no more profane with your gifts, and 
with your idols. 40For in My holy 
mountain, in the mountain of the 
height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, 
there shall all the house of Israel, all of 
them, serve Me in the land; there will I 
accept them, and there will I require 
your heave-offerings, and the first of 
your gifts, with all your holy things. 
41With your sweet savour will I accept 
you, when I bring you out from the 
peoples, and gather you out of the 
countries wherein ye have been 
scattered; and I will be sanctified in 
you in the sight of the nations. 42And 
ye shall know that I am the LORD, 
when I shall bring you into the land of 
Israel, into the country which I lifted 
up My hand to give unto your fathers. 
43And there shall ye remember your 
ways, and all your doings, wherein ye 
have polluted yourselves; and ye shall 
loathe yourselves in your own sight for 
all your evils that ye have committed. 
44And ye shall know that I am the 
LORD, when I have wrought with you 
for My name’s sake, not according to 
your evil ways, nor according to your 
corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, 
saith the Lord GOD.’ 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, set thy face toward the South, 
and preach toward the South, and 
prophesy against the forest of the field 
in the South; 3and say to the forest of 
the South: Hear the word of the LORD: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I 
will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall 
devour every green tree in thee, and 
every dry tree, it shall not be 
quenched, even a flaming flame; and 
all faces from the south to the north 
shall be seared thereby. 4all flesh shall 
see that I the LORD have kindled it; it 
shall not be quenched.’ 5Then said I: 
‘Ah Lord GOD! they say of me: Is he 
not a maker of parables?’ 

6Then the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 7’Son of man, set thy 
face toward Jerusalem, and preach 
toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy 
against the land of Israel; 8say to the 
21 




land of Israel: Thus saith the LORD: 
Behold, I am against thee, and will 
draw forth My sword out of its sheath, 
and will cut off from thee the righteous 
and the wicked. 9Seeing then that I will 
cut off from thee the righteous and the 
wicked, therefore shall My sword go 
forth out of its sheath against all flesh 
from the south to the north; 10and all 
flesh shall know that I the LORD have 
drawn forth My sword out of its 
sheath; it shall not return any more. 
11Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with 
the breaking of thy loins and with 
bitterness shalt thou sigh before their 
eyes. 12And it shall be, when they say 
unto thee: Wherefore sighest thou? 
that thou shalt say: Because of the 
tidings, for it cometh; and every heart 
shall melt, and all hands shall be slack, 
and every spirit shall be faint, and all 
knees shall drip with water; behold, it 
cometh, and it shall be done, saith the 
Lord GOD.’ 

13And the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 14’Son of man, 
prophesy, and say: Thus saith the 
LORD: Say: 

A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, 

And also furbished: 

15It is sharpened that it may make a 
sore slaughter, 

It is furbished that it may glitter— 

Or shall we make mirth?— 

Against the rod of My son, 
contemning every tree. 

16 And it is given to be furbished, 

That it may be handled; 

The sword, it is sharpened, 

Yea, it is furbished, 

To give it into the hand of the 
slayer. 

17Cry and wail, son of man; for it is 
upon My people, it is upon all the 
princes of Israel; they are thrust down 
to the sword with My people; smite 
therefore upon thy thigh. 18For there is 
a trial; and what if it contemn even the 
rod? It shall be no more, saith the Lord 
GOD. 19Thou therefore, son of man, 
prophesy, and smite thy hands 
together; and let the sword be doubled 
the third time, the sword of those to be 
slain; it is the sword of the great one 
that is to be slain, which compasseth 
them about. 20I have set the point of 
the sword against all their gates, that 
their heart may melt, and their 
stumblings be multiplied; ah! it is 
made glittering, it is sharpened for 
slaughter. 21Go thee one way to the 
right, or direct thyself to the left; 
whither is thy face set? 22I will also 
smite My hands together, and I will 
satisfy My fury; I the LORD have 
spoken it.’ 

23And the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 24‘Now, thou son of 
man, make thee two ways, that the 
sword of the king of Babylon may 
come; they twain shall come forth out 
of one land; and mark a signpost, mark 
it clear at the head of the way to the 
city. 25Thou shalt make a way, that the 
sword may come to Rabbah of the 
children of Ammon, and to Judah in 
Jerusalem the fortified. 26For the king 
of Babylon standeth at the parting of 


the way, at the head of the two ways, 
to use divination; he shaketh the 
arrows to and fro, he inquireth of the 
teraphim, he looketh in the liver. 27In 
his right hand is the lot Jerusalem, to 
set battering rams, to open the mouth 
for the slaughter, to lift up the voice 
with shouting, to set battering rams 
against the gates, to cast up mounds, to 
build forts. 28And it shall be unto them 
as a false divination in their sight, who 
have weeks upon weeks! but it 
bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that 
they may be taken. 

29Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Because ye have made your iniquity to 
be remembered, in that your 
transgressions are uncovered, so that 
your sins do appear in all your doings; 
because that ye are come to 
remembrance, ye shall be taken with 
the hand. 30And thou, O wicked one, 
that art to be slain, the prince of Israel, 
whose day is come, in the time of the 
iniquity of the end; 31thus saith the 
Lord GOD: The mitre shall be removed, 
and the crown taken off; this shall be 
no more the same: that which is low 
shall be exalted, and that which is high 
abased. 32A ruin, a ruin, a ruin, will I 
make it; this also shall be no more, 
until he come whose right it is, and I 
will give it him. 

33And thou, son of man, prophesy, 
and say: Thus saith the Lord GOD 
concerning the children of Ammon, 
and concerning their taunt; and say 
thou: 

O sword, O sword keen-edged, 

Furbished for the slaughter, 

To the uttermost, because of the 
glitterings; 

34While they see falsehood unto 
thee, 

While they divine lies unto thee, 

To lay thee upon the necks of the 
wicked that are to be slain, 

Whose day is come, in the time of 
the iniquity of the end!— 

35Cause it to return into its sheath!— 

In the place where thou wast 
created, in the land of thine 
origin, 

Will I judge thee. 

36And I will pour out My 
indignation upon thee, 

I will blow upon thee with the fire 
of My wrath; 

And I will deliver thee into the hand 
of brutish men, 

Skilful to destroy. 

37Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; 

Thy blood shall be in the midst of 
the land, 

Thou shalt be no more remembered; 

For I the LORD have spoken it.’ 

 

Moreover the word of the 
LORD came unto me, saying: 
2’Now, thou, son of man, wilt thou 
judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? 
then cause her to know all her 
abominations. 3And thou shalt say: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD: O city that 
sheddest blood in the midst of thee, 
that thy time may come, and that 
makest idols unto thyself to defile 
thee; 4thou art become guilty in thy 
22 




blood that thou hast shed, and art 
defiled in thine idols which thou hast 
made; and thou hast caused thy days to 
draw near, and art come even unto thy 
years; therefore have I made thee a 
reproach unto the nations, and a 
mocking to all the countries! 5Those 
that are near, and those that are far 
from thee, shall mock thee, thou 
defiled of name and full of tumult. 

6Behold, the princes of Israel, every 
one according to his might, have been 
in thee to shed blood. 7In thee have 
they made light of father and mother; 
in the midst of thee have they dealt by 
oppression with the stranger; in thee 
have they wronged the fatherless and 
the widow. 8Thou hast despised My 
holy things, and hast profaned My 
sabbaths. 9In thee have been 
talebearers to shed blood; and in thee 
they have eaten upon the mountains; in 
the midst of thee they have committed 
lewdness. 10In thee have they 
uncovered their fathers’nakedness; in 
thee have they humbled her that was 
unclean in her impurity. 11And each 
hath committed abomination with his 
neighbour’s wife; and each hath 
lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; 
and each in thee hath humbled his 
sister, his father’s daughter. 12In thee 
have they taken gifts to shed blood; 
thou hast taken interest and increase, 
and thou hast greedily gained of thy 
neighbours by oppression, and hast 
forgotten Me, saith the Lord GOD. 

13Behold, therefore, I have smitten 
My hand at thy dishonest gain which 
thou hast made, and at thy blood 
which hath been in the midst of thee. 
14Can thy heart endure, or can thy 
hands be strong, in the days that I shall 
deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken 
it, and will do it. 15And I will scatter 
thee among the nations, and disperse 
thee through the countries; and I will 
consume thy filthiness out of thee. 
16And thou shalt be profaned in 
thyself, in the sight of the nations; and 
thou shalt know that I am the LORD.’ 

17And the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 18’Son of man, the 
house of Israel is become dross unto 
Me; all of them are brass and tin and 
iron and lead, in the midst of the 
furnace; they are the dross of silver. 
19Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Because ye are all become dross, 
therefore, behold, I will gather you 
into the midst of Jerusalem. 20As they 
gather silver and brass and iron and 
lead and tin into the midst of the 
furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to 
melt it; so will I gather you in Mine 
anger and in My fury, and I will cast 
you in, and melt you. 21Yea, I will 
gather you, and blow upon you with 
the fire of My wrath, and ye shall be 
melted in the midst thereof. 22As silver 
is melted in the midst of the furnace, 
so shall ye be melted in the midst 
thereof; and ye shall know that I the 
LORD have poured out My fury upon 
you.’ 

23And the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 24’Son of man, say 
unto her: Thou art a land that is not 


cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of 
indignation. 25There is a conspiracy of 
her prophets in the midst thereof, like 
a roaring lion ravening the prey; they 
have devoured souls, they take 
treasure and precious things, they have 
made her widows many in the midst 
thereof. 26Her priests have done 
violence to My law, and have profaned 
My holy things; they have put no 
difference between the holy and the 
common, neither have they taught 
difference between the unclean and the 
clean, and have hid their eyes from My 
sabbaths, and I am profaned among 
them. 27Her princes in the midst 
thereof are like wolves ravening the 
prey: to shed blood, and to destroy 
souls, so as to get dishonest gain. 
28And her prophets have daubed for 
them with whited plaster, seeing 
falsehood, and divining lies unto them, 
saying: Thus saith the Lord GOD, when 
the LORD hath not spoken. 29The people 
of the land have used oppression, and 
exercised robbery, and have wronged 
the poor and needy, and have 
oppressed the stranger unlawfully. 
30And I sought for a man among them, 
that should make up the hedge, and 
stand in the breach before Me for the 
land, that I should not destroy it; but I 
found none. 31Therefore have I poured 
out Mine indignation upon them; I 
have consumed them with the fire of 
My wrath; their own way have I 
brought upon their heads, saith the 
Lord GOD.’ 

 

23 



And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, there were two women, the 
daughters of one mother; 3and they 
committed harlotries in Egypt; they 
committed harlotries in their youth; 
there were their bosoms pressed, and 
there their virgin breasts were bruised. 
4And the names of them were Oholah 
the elder, and Oholibah her sister; and 
they became Mine, and they bore sons 
and daughters. And as for their names, 
Samaria is aOholah, and Jerusalem 
bOholibah. 

a That is, Her tent. 

b That is, My tent is in her. 

5And Oholah played the harlot when 
she was Mine; and she doted on her 
lovers, on the Assyrians, warriors, 
6clothed with blue, governors and 
rulers, handsome young men all of 
them, horsemen riding upon horses. 
7And she bestowed her harlotries upon 
them, the choicest men of Assyria all 
of them; and on whomsoever she 
doted, with all their idols she defiled 
herself. 8Neither hath she left her 
harlotries brought from Egypt; for in 
her youth they lay with her, and they 
bruised her virgin breasts; and they 
poured out their lust upon her. 
9Wherefore I delivered her into the 
hand of her lovers, into the hand of the 
Assyrians, upon whom she doted. 
10These uncovered her nakedness; they 
took her sons and her daughters, and 
her they slew with the sword; and she 


became a byword among women, for 
judgments were executed upon her. 

11And her sister Oholibah saw this, 
yet was she more corrupt in her doting 
than she, and in her harlotries more 
than her sister in her harlotries. 12She 
doted upon the Assyrians, governors 
and rulers, warriors, clothed most 
gorgeously, horsemen riding upon 
horses, all of them handsome young 
men. 13And I saw that she was defiled; 
they both took one way. 14And she 
increased her harlotries; for she saw 
men portrayed upon the wall, the 
images of the Chaldeans portrayed 
with vermilion, 15girded with girdles 
upon their loins, with pendant turbans 
upon their heads, all of them captains 
to look upon, the likeness of the sons 
of Babylon, even of Chaldea, the land 
of their nativity. 16And as soon as she 
saw them she doted upon them, and 
sent messengers unto them into 
Chaldea. 17And the Babylonians came 
to her into the bed of love, and they 
defiled her with their lust; and she was 
polluted with them, and her soul was 
alienated from them. 18So she 
uncovered her harlotries, and 
uncovered her nakedness; then My 
soul was alienated from her, like as 
My soul was alienated from her sister. 
19Yet she multiplied her harlotries, 
remembering the days of her youth, 
wherein she had played the harlot in 
the land of Egypt. 20And she doted 
upon concubinage with them, whose 
flesh is as the flesh of asses, and 
whose issue is like the issue of horses. 
21Thus thou didst call to remembrance 
the lewdness of thy youth, when they 
from Egypt bruised thy breasts for the 
bosom of thy youth. 

22Therefore, O Oholibah, thus saith 
the Lord GOD: Behold, I will raise up 
thy lovers against thee, from whom thy 
soul is alienated, and I will bring them 
against thee on every side: 23the 
Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, 
Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the 
Assyrians with them, handsome young 
men, governors and rulers all of them, 
captains and councillors, all of them 
riding upon horses. 24And they shall 
come against thee with hosts, chariots, 
and wheels, and with an assembly of 
peoples; they shall set themselves in 
array against thee with buckler and 
shield and helmet round about; and I 
will commit the judgment unto them, 
and they shall judge thee according to 
their judgments. 25And I will set My 
jealousy against thee, and they shall 
deal with thee in fury; they shall take 
away thy nose and thine ears, and thy 
residue shall fall by the sword; they 
shall take thy sons and thy daughters, 
and thy residue shall be devoured by 
the fire. 26They shall also strip thee of 
thy clothes, and take away thy fair 
jewels. 27Thus will I make thy 
lewdness to cease from thee, and thy 
harlotry brought from the land of 
Egypt, so that thou shalt not lift up 
thine eyes unto them, nor remember 
Egypt any more. 

28For thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Behold, I will deliver thee into the 


hand of them whom thou hatest, into 
the hand of them from whom thy soul 
is alienated; 29and they shall deal with 
thee in hatred, and shall take away all 
thy labour, and shall leave thee naked 
and bare; and the nakedness of thy 
harlotries shall be uncovered, both thy 
lewdness and thy harlotries. 30These 
things shall be done unto thee, for that 
thou hast gone astray after the nations, 
and because thou art polluted with 
their idols. 31In the way of thy sister 
hast thou walked; therefore will I give 
her cup into thy hand. 32Thus saith the 
Lord GOD: 

Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup, 

Which is deep and large; 

Thou shalt be for a scorn and a 
derision; 

It is full to the uttermost. 

33Thou shalt be filled with 
drunkenness and sorrow, 

With the cup of astonishment and 
appalment, 

With the cup of thy sister Samaria. 

34Thou shalt even drink it and drain 
it, 

And thou shalt craunch the sherds 
thereof, 

And shalt tear thy breasts; 

For I have spoken it, 

Saith the Lord GOD. 

35Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Because thou hast forgotten Me, and 
cast Me behind thy back, therefore 
bear thou also thy lewdness and thy 
harlotries.’ 

36The LORD said moreover unto me: 
‘Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah 
and Oholibah? then declare unto them 
their abominations. 37For they have 
committed adultery, and blood is in 
their hands, and with their idols have 
they committed adultery; and their 
sons, whom they bore unto Me, they 
have also set apart unto them to be 
devoured. 38Moreover this they have 
done unto Me: they have defiled My 
sanctuary in the same day, and have 
profaned My sabbaths. 39For when 
they had slain their children to their 
idols, then they came the same day 
into My sanctuary to profane it; and, 
lo, thus have they done in the midst of 
My house. 40And furthermore ye have 
sent for men that come from far; unto 
whom a messenger was sent, and, lo, 
they came; for whom thou didst wash 
thyself, paint thine eyes, and deck 
thyself with ornaments; 41and sattest 
upon a stately bed, with a table 
prepared before it, whereupon thou 
didst set Mine incense and Mine oil. 
42And the voice of a multitude being at 
ease was therein; and for the sake of 
men, they were so many, brought 
drunken from the wilderness, they put 
bracelets upon their hands, and 
beautiful crowns upon their heads. 
43Then said I of her that was worn out 
by adulteries: Still they commit 
harlotries with her, even her. 44For 
every one went in unto her, as men go 
in unto a harlot; so went they in unto 
Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd 
women. 45But righteous men, they 
shall judge them as adulteresses are 
judged, and as women that shed blood 


are judged; because they are 
adulteresses, and blood is in their 
hands. 

46For thus saith the Lord GOD: An 
assembly shall be brought up against 
them, and they shall be made a horror 
and a spoil. 47And the assembly shall 
stone them with stones, and despatch 
them with their swords; they shall slay 
their sons and their daughters, and 
burn up their houses with fire. 48Thus 
will I cause lewdness to cease out of 
the land, that all women may be taught 
not to do after your lewdness. 49And 
your lewdness shall be recompensed 
upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of 
your idols; and ye shall know that I am 
the Lord GOD.’ 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me in the ninth 
year, in the tenth month, in the tenth 
day of the month, saying: 2’Son of 
man, write thee the name of the day, 
even of this selfsame day; this 
selfsame day the king of Babylon hath 
invested Jerusalem. 3And utter a 
parable concerning the rebellious 
house, and say unto them: Thus saith 
the Lord GOD: 

Set on the pot, set it on, 

And also pour water into it; 

4Gather into it the pieces belonging 
to it, 

Even every good piece, the thigh, 
and the shoulder; 

Fill it with the choice bones. 

5Take the choice of the flock, 

And pile also the bones under it; 

Make it boil well, 

That the bones thereof may also be 
seethed in the midst of it. 

6Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Woe to the bloody city, to the pot 
whose filth is therein, and whose filth 
is not gone out of it! bring it out piece 
by piece; no lot is fallen upon it. 7For 
her blood is in the midst of her; she set 
it upon the bare rock; she poured it not 
upon the ground, to cover it with dust; 
8that it might cause fury to come up, 
that vengeance might be taken, I have 
set her blood upon the bare rock, that it 
should not be covered. 9Therefore thus 
saith the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody 
city! I also will make the pile great, 
10heaping on the wood, kindling the 
fire, that the flesh may be consumed; 
and preparing the mixture, that the 
bones also may be burned; 11then will I 
set it empty upon the coals thereof, 
that it may be hot, and the bottom 
thereof may burn, and that the 
impurity of it may be molten in it, that 
the filth of it may be consumed12It 
hath wearied itself with toil; yet its 
great filth goeth not forth out of it, yea, 
its noisome filth. 13Because of thy 
filthy lewdness, because I have purged 
thee and thou wast not purged, thou 
shalt not be purged from thy filthiness 
any more, till I have satisfied My fury 
upon thee. 14I the LORD have spoken it; 
it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I 
will not go back, neither will I spare, 
neither will I repent; according to thy 
ways, and according to thy doings, 
shall they judge thee, saith the Lord 
GOD.’ 
24 




15Also the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 16’Son of man, 
behold, I take away from thee the 
desire of thine eyes with a stroke; yet 
neither shalt thou make lamentation 
nor weep, neither shall thy tears run 
down. 17Sigh in silence; make no 
mourning for the dead, bind thy 
headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes 
upon thy feet, and cover not thine 
upper lip, and eat not the bread of 
men.’ 18So I spoke unto the people in 
the morning, and at even my wife 
died; and I did in the morning as I was 
commanded. 19And the people said 
unto me: ‘Wilt thou not tell us what 
these things are to us, that thou doest 
so?’ 20Then I said unto them: ‘The 
word of the LORD came unto me, 
saying: 21Speak unto the house of 
Israel: Thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Behold, I will profane My sanctuary, 
the pride of your power, the desire of 
your eyes, and the longing of your 
soul; and your sons and your daughters 
whom ye have left behind shall fall by 
the sword. 22And ye shall do as I have 
done: ye shall not cover your upper 
lips, nor eat the bread of men; 23and 
your tires shall be upon your heads, 
and your shoes upon your feet; ye shall 
not make lamentation nor weep; but ye 
shall pine away in your iniquities, and 
moan one toward another. 24Thus shall 
Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according 
to all that he hath done shall ye do; 
when this cometh, then shall ye know 
that I am the Lord GOD. 

25And thou, son of man, shall it not 
be in the day when I take from them 
their stronghold, the joy of their glory, 
the desire of their eyes, and the 
yearning of their soul, their sons and 
their daughters, 26that in that day he 
that escapeth shall come unto thee, to 
cause thee to hear it with thine ears? 
27In that day shall thy mouth be 
opened together with him that is 
escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be 
no more dumb; so shalt thou be a sign 
unto them; and they shall know that I 
am the LORD.’ 

 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, set thy face toward the 
children of Ammon, and prophesy 
against them; 3and say unto the 
children of Ammon: Hear the word of 
the Lord GOD: Thus saith the Lord 
GOD: Because thou saidst: Aha! against 
My sanctuary, when it was profaned, 
and against the land of Israel, when it 
was made desolate, and against the 
house of Judah, when they went into 
captivity; 4therefore, behold, I will 
deliver thee to the children of the east 
for a possession, and they shall set 
their encampments in thee, and make 
their dwellings in thee; they shall eat 
thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. 
5And I will make Rabbah a pasture for 
camels, and the children of Ammon a 
couching-place for flocks; and ye shall 
know that I am the LORD. 6For thus 
saith the Lord GOD: Because thou hast 
clapped thy hands, and stamped with 
25 




the feet, and rejoiced with all the 
disdain of thy soul against the land of 
Israel; 7therefore, behold, I stretch out 
My hand upon thee, and will deliver 
thee for a spoil to the nations; and I 
will cut thee off from the peoples, and 
I will cause thee to perish out of the 
countries; I will destroy thee, and thou 
shalt know that I am the LORD. 

8Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because 
that Moab and Seir do say: Behold, the 
house of Judah is like unto all the 
nations, 9therefore, behold, I will open 
the flank of Moab on the side of the 
cities, on the side of his cities which 
are on his frontiers, the beauteous 
country of Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, 
and Kiriathaim, 10together with the 
children of Ammon, unto the children 
of the east, and I will give them for a 
possession, that the children of 
Ammon may not be remembered 
among the nations; 11and I will execute 
judgments upon Moab; and they shall 
know that I am the LORD. 

12Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because 
that Edom hath dealt against the house 
of Judah by taking vengeance, and 
hath greatly offended, and revenged 
himself upon them; 13therefore thus 
saith the Lord GOD: I will stretch out 
My hand upon Edom, and will cut off 
man and beast from it; and I will make 
it desolate from Teman, even unto 
Dedan shall they fall by the sword. 
14And I will lay My vengeance upon 
Edom by the hand of My people Israel; 
and they shall do in Edom according to 
Mine anger and according to My fury; 
and they shall know my vengeance, 
saith the Lord GOD. 

15Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because 
the Philistines have dealt by revenge, 
and have taken vengeance with disdain 
of soul to destroy, for the old hatred; 
16therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Behold, I will stretch out My hand 
upon the Philistines, and I will cut off 
the Cherethites, and destroy the 
remnant of the sea-coast. 17And I will 
execute great vengeance upon them 
with furious rebukes; and they shall 
know that I am the LORD, when I shall 
lay My vengeance upon them.’ 

And it came to pass in the 
eleventh year, in the first day 
of the month, that the word of the 
LORD came unto me, saying: 2’Son of 
man, because that Tyre hath said 
against Jerusalem: 

Aha, she is broken that was the gate 
of the peoples; 

She is turned unto me; 

I shall be filled with her that is laid 
waste; 

3Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 

Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, 

And will cause many nations to 
come up against thee, 

As the sea causeth its waves to 
come up. 

4And they shall destroy the walls of 
Tyre, 

And break down her towers; 

I will also scrape her dust from her, 

And make her a bare rock. 

5She shall be a place for the 
spreading of nets 
26 




In the midst of the sea; 

For I have spoken it, saith the Lord 
GOD; 

And she shall become a spoil to the 
nations. 

6And her daughters that are in the 
field 

Shall be slain with the sword; 

And they shall know that I am the 
LORD. 

7For thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I 
will bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar 
king of Babylon, king of kings, from 
the north, with horses, and with 
chariots, and with horsemen, and a 
company, and much people. 

8He shall slay with the sword 

Thy daughters in the field; 

And he shall make forts against 
thee, 

And cast up a mound against thee, 

And set up bucklers against thee. 

9And he shall set his battering 
engines 

Against thy walls, 

And with his axes 

He shall break down thy towers. 

10By reason of the abundance of his 
horses 

Their dust shall cover thee; 

At the noise of the horsemen, 

And of the wheels, and of the 
chariots, 

Thy walls shall shake, 

When he shall enter into thy gates, 

As men enter into a city 

Wherein is made a breach. 

11With the hoofs of his horses 

Shall he tread down all thy streets; 

He shall slay thy people with the 
sword, 

And the pillars of thy strength 

Shall go down to the ground. 

12And they shall make a spoil of thy 
riches, 

And make a prey of thy 
merchandise; 

And they shall break down thy 
walls, 

And destroy the houses of thy 
delight; 

And thy stones and thy timber and 
thy dust 

Shall they lay in the midst of the 
waters. 

13And I will cause the noise of thy 
songs to cease, 

And the sound of thy harps shall be 
no more heard. 

14And I will make thee a bare rock; 

Thou shalt be a place for the 
spreading of nets, 

Thou shalt be built no more; 

For I the LORD have spoken, 

Saith the Lord GOD. 

15Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyre: 
Shall not the isles shake at the sound 
of thy fall, when the wounded groan, 
when the slaughter is made in the 
midst of thee? 

16Then all the princes of the sea 
shall come down from their thrones, 
and lay away their robes, and strip off 
their richly woven garments; they shall 
clothe themselves with trembling; they 
shall sit upon the ground, and shall 
tremble every moment, and be 
appalled at thee. 


17And they shall take up a 
lamentation for thee, and say to thee: 

How art thou destroyed, that wast 
peopled from the seas, 

The renowned city, 

That wast strong in the sea, 

Thou and thy inhabitants, 

That caused your terror to be 

On all that inhabit the earth! 

18Now shall the isles tremble 

In the day of thy fall; 

Yea, the isles that are in the sea 

Shall be affrighted at thy going out. 

19For thus saith the Lord GOD: When I 
shall make thee a desolate city, like the 
cities that are not inhabited; when I 
shall bring up the deep upon thee, and 
the great waters shall cover thee; 
20then will I bring thee down with 
them that descend into the pit, to the 
people of old time, and will make thee 
to dwell in the nether parts of the 
earth, like the places that are desolate 
of old, with them that go down to the 
pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I 
will set glory in the land of the living; 
21I will make thee a terror, and thou 
shalt be no more; though thou be 
sought for, yet shalt thou never be 
found again, saith the Lord GOD.’ 

Moreover the word of the 
LORD came unto me, saying: 
2’And thou, son of man, take up a 
lamentation for Tyre, 3and say unto 
Tyre, that dwelleth at the entry of the 
sea, that is the merchant of the peoples 
unto many isles: Thus saith the Lord 
GOD: 

Thou, O Tyre, hast said: 

I am of perfect beauty. 

4Thy borders are in the heart of the 
seas, 

Thy builders have perfected thy 
beauty. 

5Of cypress-trees from Senir have 
they fashioned 

All thy planks; 

They have taken cedars from 
Lebanon 

To make masts for thee. 

6Of the oaks of Bashan 

Have they made thine oars; 

Thy deck have they made of ivory 
inlaid in larch, 

From the isles of the Kittites. 

7Of fine linen with richly woven 
work from Egypt 

Was thy sail, 

That it might be to thee for an 
ensign; 

Blue and purple from the isles of 
Elishah 

Was thine awning. 

8The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad 

Were thy rowers; 

Thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee, 

They were thy pilots. 

9The elders of Gebal and the wise 
men thereof 

Were in thee thy calkers; 

All the ships of the sea with their 
mariners were in thee 

To exchange thy merchandise. 

10Persia and Lud and Put were in 
thine army, 

Thy men of war; 

They hanged the shield and helmet 
in thee, 
27 




They set forth thy comeliness. 

11The men of Arvad and Helech were 
upon thy walls round about, and the 
Gammadim were in thy towers; they 
hanged their shields upon thy walls 
round about; they have perfected thy 
beauty. 12Tarshish was thy merchant 
by reason of the multitude of all kinds 
of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and 
lead, they traded for thy wares. 
13Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they 
were thy traffickers; they traded the 
persons of men and vessels of brass for 
thy merchandise. 14They of the house 
of Togarmah traded for thy wares with 
horses and horsemen and mules. 15The 
men of Dedan were thy traffickers; 
many isles were the mart of thy hand; 
they brought thee as tribute horns of 
ivory and ebony. 16Aram was thy 
merchant by reason of the multitude of 
thy wealth; they traded for thy wares 
with carbuncles, purple, and richly 
woven work, and fine linen, and coral, 
and rubies. 17Judah, and the land of 
Israel, they were thy traffickers; they 
traded for thy merchandise wheat of 
Minnith, and balsam, and honey, and 
oil, and balm. 18Damascus was thy 
merchant for the multitude of thy 
wealth, by reason of the multitude of 
all riches, with the wine of Helbon, 
and white wool. 19Vedan and Javan 
traded with yarn for thy wares; 
massive iron, cassia, and calamus, 
were among thy merchandise. 20Dedan 
was thy trafficker in precious cloths 
for riding. 21Arabia, and all the princes 
of Kedar, they were the merchants of 
thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and 
goats, in these were they thy 
merchants. 22The traffickers of Sheba 
and Raamah, they were thy traffickers; 
they traded for thy wares with chief of 
all spices, and with all precious stones, 
and gold. 23Haran and Canneh and 
Eden, the traffickers of Sheba, Asshur 
was as thine apprentice in traffic. 
24These were thy traffickers in 
gorgeous fabrics, in wrappings of blue 
and richly woven work, and in chests 
of rich apparel, bound with cords and 
cedar-lined, among thy merchandise. 
25The ships of Tarshish brought thee 
tribute for thy merchandise; 

 

So wast thou replenished, and made 
very heavy 

In the heart of the seas. 

26Thy rowers have brought thee 

Into great waters; 

The east wind hath broken thee 

In the heart of the seas. 

27Thy riches, and thy wares, thy 
merchandise, 

Thy mariners, and thy pilots, 

Thy calkers, and the exchangers of 
thy merchandise, 

And all thy men of war, that are in 
thee, 

With all thy company which is in 
the midst of thee, 

Shall fall into the heart of the seas 

In the day of thy ruin. 

28At the sound of the cry of thy 
pilots 

The waves shall shake. 

29And all that handle the oar, 


The mariners, and all the pilots of 
the sea, 

Shall come down from their ships, 

They shall stand upon the land, 

30And shall cause their voice to be 
heard over thee, 

And shall cry bitterly, 

And shall cast up dust upon their 
heads, 

They shall roll themselves in the 
ashes; 

31And they shall make themselves 
utterly bald for thee, 

And gird them with sackcloth, 

And they shall weep for thee in 
bitterness of soul 

With bitter lamentation. 

32And in their wailing they shall 
take up a lamentation for thee, 

And lament over thee: 

Who was there like Tyre, fortified 

In the midst of the sea? 

33When thy wares came forth out of 
the seas, 

Thou didst fill many peoples; 

With the multitude of thy riches and 
of thy merchandise 

Didst thou enrich the kings of the 
earth. 

34Now that thou art broken by the 
seas 

In the depths of the waters, 

And thy merchandise and all thy 
company 

Are fallen in the midst of thee, 

35All the inhabitants of the isles 

Are appalled at thee, 

And their kings are horribly afraid, 

They are troubled in their 
countenance; 

36The merchants among the peoples 
hiss at thee; 

Thou art become a terror, 

And never shalt be any more.’ 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, say unto the prince of Tyre: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD: 

Because thy heart is lifted up, 

And thou hast said: I am a god, 

I sit in the seat of God, 

In the heart of the seas; 

Yet thou art man, and not God, 

Though thou didst set thy heart as 
the heart of God— 

3Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel! 

There is no secret that they can hide 
from thee! 

4By thy wisdom and by thy 
discernment 

Thou hast gotten thee riches, 

And hast gotten gold and silver 

Into thy treasures; 

5In thy great wisdom by thy traffic 

Hast thou increased thy riches, 

And thy heart is lifted up because of 
thy riches— 

6Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 

Because thou hast set thy heart 

As the heart of God; 

7Therefore, behold, I will bring 
strangers upon thee, 

The terrible of the nations; 

And they shall draw their swords 
against the beauty of thy wisdom, 

And they shall defile thy brightness. 
28 




8They shall bring thee down to the 
pit; 

And thou shalt die the deaths of 
them that are slain, 

In the heart of the seas. 

9Wilt thou yet say before him that 
slayeth thee: 

I am God? 

But thou art man, and not God, 

In the hand of them that defile thee. 

10Thou shalt die the deaths of the 
uncircumcised 

By the hand of strangers; 

For I have spoken, saith the Lord 
GOD.’ 

11Moreover the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 12’Son of man, take 
up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, 
and say unto him: Thus saith the Lord 
GOD: Thou seal most accurate, full of 
wisdom, and perfect in beauty, 13thou 
wast in Eden the garden of God; every 
precious stone was thy covering, the 
carnelian, the topaz, and the emerald, 
the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the 
sapphire, the carbuncle, and the 
smaragd, and gold; the workmanship 
of thy settings and of thy sockets was 
in thee, in the day that thou wast 
created they were prepared. 14Thou 
wast the far-covering cherub; and I set 
thee, so that thou wast upon the holy 
mountain of God; thou hast walked up 
and down in the midst of stones of fire. 
15Thou wast perfect in thy ways from 
the day that thou wast created, till 
unrighteousness was found in thee. 
16By the multitude of thy traffic they 
filled the midst of thee with violence, 
and thou hast sinned; therefore have I 
cast thee as profane out of the 
mountain of God; and I have destroyed 
thee, O covering cherub, from the 
midst of the stones of fire. 17Thy heart 
was lifted up because of thy beauty, 
thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by 
reason of thy brightness; I have cast 
thee to the ground, I have laid thee 
before kings, that they may gaze upon 
thee. 18By the multitude of thine 
iniquities, in the unrighteousness of 
thy traffic, thou hast profaned thy 
sanctuaries; therefore have I brought 
forth a fire from the midst of thee, it 
hath devoured thee, and I have turned 
thee to ashes upon the earth in the 
sight of all them that behold thee. 19All 
they that know thee among the peoples 
shall be appalled at thee; thou art 
become a terror, and thou shalt never 
be any more.’ 

20And the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 21’Son of man, set thy 
face toward Zidon, and prophesy 
against it, 22and say: Thus saith the 
Lord GOD: 

Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon, 

And I will be glorified in the midst 
of thee; 

And they shall know that I am the 
LORD, when I shall have executed 
judgments in her, and shall be 
sanctified in her. 

23For I will send into her pestilence 

And blood in her streets; 

And the wounded shall fall in the 
midst of her 


By the sword upon her on every 
side; and they shall know that I am the 
LORD. 24And there shall be no more a 
pricking brier unto the house of Israel, 
nor a piercing thorn of any that are 
round about them, that did have them 
in disdain; and they shall know that I 
am the Lord GOD. 

25Thus saith the Lord GOD: When I 
shall have gathered the house of Israel 
from the peoples among whom they 
are scattered, and shall be sanctified in 
them in the sight of the nations, then 
shall they dwell in their own land 
which I gave to My servant Jacob. 
26And they shall dwell safely therein, 
and shall build houses, and plant 
vineyards; yea, they shall dwell safely; 
when I have executed judgments upon 
all those that have them in disdain 
round about them; and they shall know 
that I am the LORD their God.’ 

In the tenth year, in the tenth 
month, in the twelfth day of 
the month, the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 2’Son of man, set thy 
face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, 
and prophesy against him, and against 
all Egypt; 3speak, and say: Thus saith 
the Lord GOD: 

Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh 

King of Egypt, 

The great dragon that lieth 

In the midst of his rivers, 

That hath said: My river is mine 
own, 

And I have made it for myself. 

4And I will put hooks in thy jaws, 
and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to 
stick unto thy scales; and I will bring 
thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, 
and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick 
unto thy scales. 5And I will cast thee 
into the wilderness, 

Thee and all the fish of thy rivers; 

Thou shalt fall upon the open field; 

Thou shalt not be brought together, 
nor gathered; 

To the beasts of the earth and to the 
fowls of the heaven 

Have I given thee for food. 

6And all the inhabitants of Egypt 
shall know 

That I am the LORD, 

Because they have been a staff of 
reed 

To the house of Israel. 

7When they take hold of thee with 
the hand, thou dost break, 

And rend all their shoulders; 

And when they lean upon thee, thou 
breakest, 

And makest all their loins to be at a 
stand. 

8Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, 
and will cut off from thee man and 
beast. 9And the land of Egypt shall be 
desolate and waste, and they shall 
know that I am the LORD; because he 
hath said: The river is mine, and I have 
made it. 10Therefore, behold, I am 
against thee, and against thy rivers, 
and I will make the land of Egypt 
utterly waste and desolate, from 
Migdol to Syene even unto the border 
of Ethiopia. 11No foot of man shall 
pass through it, nor foot of beast shall 
29 




pass through it, neither shall it be 
inhabited forty years. 12And I will 
make the land of Egypt desolate in the 
midst of the countries that are desolate, 
and her cities among the cities that are 
laid waste shall be desolate forty 
years; and I will scatter the Egyptians 
among the nations, and will disperse 
them through the countries. 

13For thus saith the Lord GOD: At the 
end of forty years will I gather the 
Egyptians from the peoples whither 
they were scattered; 14and I will turn 
the captivity of Egypt, and will cause 
them to return into the land of Pathros, 
into the land of their origin; and they 
shall be there a lowly kingdom. 15It 
shall be the lowliest of the kingdoms, 
neither shall it any more lift itself up 
above the nations; and I will diminish 
them, that they shall no more rule over 
the nations. 16And it shall be no more 
the confidence of the house of Israel, 
bringing iniquity to remembrance, 
when they turn after them; and they 
shall know that I am the Lord GOD.’ 

17And it came to pass in the seven 
and twentieth year, in the first month, 
in the first day of the month, the word 
of the LORD came unto me, saying: 
18’Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of 
Babylon caused his army to serve a 
great service against Tyre; every head 
was made bald, and every shoulder 
was peeled; yet had he no wages, nor 
his army, from Tyre, for the service 
that he had served against it; 
19Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Behold, I will give the land of Egypt 
unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 
and he shall carry off her abundance, 
and take her spoil, and take her prey; 
and it shall be the wages for his army. 
20I have given him the land of Egypt as 
his hire for which he served, because 
they wrought for Me, saith the Lord 
GOD. 

21In that day will I cause a horn to 
shoot up unto the house of Israel, and I 
will give thee the opening of the 
mouth in the midst of them; and they 
shall know that I am the LORD.’ 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith 
the Lord GOD: 

Wail ye: Woe worth the day! 

3For the day is near, 

Even the day of the LORD is near, 

A day of clouds, it shall be the time 
of the nations. 

4And a sword shall come upon 
Egypt, 

And convulsion shall be in Ethiopia, 

When the slain shall fall in Egypt; 

And they shall take away her 
abundance, 

And her foundation shall be broken 
down. 

5Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the 
mingled people, and Cub, and the 
children of the land that is in league, 
shall fall with them by the sword. 

6Thus saith the LORD: 

They also that uphold Egypt shall 
fall, 

And the pride of her power shall 
come down; 
30 




From Migdol to Syene shall they 
fall in it by the sword, 

Saith the Lord GOD. 

7And they shall be desolate in the 
midst of the countries that are 
desolate, 

And her cities shall be in the midst 
of the cities that are wasted. 

8And they shall know that I am the 
LORD, 

When I have set a fire in Egypt, 

And all her helpers are destroyed. 

9In that day shall messengers go 
forth from before Me in ships 

To make the confident Ethiopians 
afraid; 

And there shall come convulsion 
upon them in the day of Egypt; 

For, lo, it cometh. 

 

10Thus saith the Lord GOD: 

I will also make the multitude of 
Egypt to cease, 

By the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king 
of Babylon. 

11He and his people with him, the 
terrible of the nations, 

Shall be brought in to destroy the 
land; 

And they shall draw their swords 
against Egypt, 

And fill the land with the slain. 

12And I will make the rivers dry, 

And will give the land over into the 
hand of evil men; 

And I will make the land desolate, 

And all that is therein, by the hand 
of strangers; 

I the LORD have spoken it. 

 

13Thus saith the Lord GOD: 

I will also destroy the idols, 

And I will cause the things of 
nought to cease from Noph; 

And there shall be no more a prince 
out of the land of Egypt; 

And I will put a fear in the land of 
Egypt. 

14And I will make Pathros desolate, 

And will set a fire in Zoan, 

And will execute judgments in No. 

15And I will pour My fury upon Sin, 
the stronghold of Egypt; 

And I will cut off the multitude of 
No. 

16And I will set a fire in Egypt; 

Sin shall be in great convulsion, 

And No shall be rent asunder; 

And in Noph shall come adversaries 
in the day-time. 

17The young men of Aven and of Pi-
beseth shall fall by the sword; 

And these cities shall go into 
captivity. 

18At Tehaphnehes also the day shall 
withdraw itself, 

When I shall break there the yokes 
of Egypt, 

And the pride of her power shall 
cease in her; 

As for her, a cloud shall cover her, 

And her daughters shall go into 
captivity. 

19Thus will I execute judgments in 
Egypt; 

And they shall know that I am the 
LORD.’ 

 


20And it came to pass in the eleventh 
year, in the first month, in the seventh 
day of the month, that the word of the 
LORD came unto me, saying: 21’Son of 
man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh 
king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been 
bound up to be healed, to put a roller, 
that it be bound up and wax strong, 
that it hold the sword. 22Therefore thus 
saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I am 
against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and 
will break his arms, the strong, and 
that which was broken; and I will 
cause the sword to fall out of his hand. 
23And I will scatter the Egyptians 
among the nations, and will disperse 
them through the countries. 24And I 
will strengthen the arms of the king of 
Babylon, and put My sword in his 
hand; but I will break the arms of 
Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him 
with the groanings of a deadly 
wounded man. 25And I will hold up the 
arms of the king of Babylon, and the 
arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and 
they shall know that I am the LORD, 
when I shall put My sword into the 
hand of the king of Babylon, and he 
shall stretch it out upon the land of 
Egypt. 26And I will scatter the 
Egyptians among the nations, and 
disperse them through the countries; 
and they shall know that I am the 
LORD.’ 

And it came to pass in the 
eleventh year, in the third 
month, in the first day of the month, 
that the word of the LORD came unto 
me, saying: 2’Son of man, say unto 
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his 
multitude: 

Whom art thou like in thy 
greatness? 

3Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in 
Lebanon, 

With fair branches, and with a 
shadowing shroud, 

And of a high stature; 

And its top was among the thick 
boughs. 

4The waters nourished it, 

The deep made it to grow; 

Her rivers ran round 

About her plantation, 

And she sent out her conduits 

Unto all the trees of the field. 

5Therefore its stature was exalted 

Above all the trees of the field; 

And its boughs were multiplied, 

And its branches became long, 

Because of the multitude of waters, 
when it shot them forth. 

6All the fowls of heaven made 

Their nests in its boughs, 

And all the beasts of the field did 
bring forth their young 

Under its branches, 

And under its shadow dwelt 

All great nations. 

7Thus was it fair in its greatness, 

In the length of its branches; 

For its root was 

By many waters. 

8The cedars in the garden of God 

Could not hide it; 

The cypress-trees were not 

Like its boughs, 

And the plane-trees were not 
31 




As its branches; 

Nor was any tree in the garden of 
God 

Like unto it in its beauty. 

9I made it fair 

By the multitude of its branches; 

So that all the trees of Eden, 

That were in the garden of God, 
envied it. 

10Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Because thou art exalted in stature, and 
he hath set his top among the thick 
boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his 
height; 11I do even deliver him into the 
hand of the mighty one of the nations; 
he shall surely deal with him; I do 
drive him out according to his 
wickedness. 12And strangers, the 
terrible of the nations, do cut him off, 
and cast him down; upon the 
mountains and in all the valleys his 
branches are fallen, and his boughs lie 
broken in all the channels of the land; 
and all the peoples of the earth do go 
down from his shadow, and do leave 
him. 13Upon his carcass all the fowls 
of the heaven do dwell, and upon his 
branches are all the beasts of the field; 
14to the end that none of all the trees 
by the waters exalt themselves in their 
stature, neither set their top among the 
thick boughs, nor that their mighty 
ones stand up in their height, even all 
that drink water; for they are all 
delivered unto death, to the nether 
parts of the earth, in the midst of the 
children of men, with them that go 
down to the pit. 

15Thus saith the Lord GOD: In the 
day when he went down to the nether-
world I caused the deep to mourn and 
cover itself for him, and I restrained 
the rivers thereof, and the great waters 
were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to 
mourn for him, and all the trees of the 
field fainted for him. 16I made the 
nations to shake at the sound of his 
fall, when I cast him down to the 
nether-world with them that descend 
into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, 
the choice and best of Lebanon, all 
that drink water, were comforted in the 
nether parts of the earth. 17They also 
went down into the nether-world with 
him unto them that are slain by the 
sword; yea, they that were in his arm, 
that dwelt under his shadow in the 
midst of the nations. 

18To whom art thou thus like in 
glory and in greatness among the trees 
of Eden? yet shall thou be brought 
down with the trees of Eden unto the 
nether parts of the earth; thou shalt lie 
in the midst of the uncircumcised, with 
them that are slain by the sword. This 
is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith 
the Lord GOD.’ 

And it came to pass in the 
twelfth year, in the twelfth 
month, in the first day of the month, 
that the word of the LORD came unto 
me, saying: 2’Son of man, take up a 
lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, 
and say unto him: 

Thou didst liken thyself unto a 
young lion of the nations; 
32 




Whereas thou art as a dragon in the 
seas; 

And thou didst gush forth with thy 
rivers, 

And didst trouble the waters with 
thy feet, 

And foul their rivers. 

3Thus saith the Lord GOD: 

I will therefore spread out My net 
over thee 

With a company of many peoples; 

And they shall bring thee up in My 
net. 

4And I will cast thee upon the land, 

I will hurl thee upon the open field, 

And will cause all the fowls of the 
heaven to settle upon thee, 

And I will fill the beasts of the 
whole earth with thee. 

5And I will lay thy flesh upon the 
mountains, 

And fill the valleys with thy 
foulness. 

6I will also water with thy blood the 
land wherein thou swimmest, 
even to the mountains; 

And the channels shall be full of 
thee. 

7And when I shall extinguish thee, I 
will cover the heaven, 

And make the stars thereof black; 

I will cover the sun with a cloud, 

And the moon shall not give her 
light. 

8All the bright lights of heaven 

Will I make black over thee, 

And set darkness upon thy land, 

Saith the Lord GOD. 

9I will also vex the hearts of many 
peoples, when I shall bring thy 
destruction among the nations, into the 
countries which thou hast not known. 
10Yea, I will make many peoples 
appalled at thee, and their kings shall 
be horribly afraid for thee, when I 
shall brandish My sword before them; 
and they shall tremble at every 
moment, every man for his own life, in 
the day of thy fall. 

11For thus saith the Lord GOD: The 
sword of the king of Babylon shall 
come upon thee. 12By the swords of 
the mighty will I cause thy multitude 
to fall; 

The terrible of the nations are they 
all; 

And they shall spoil the pride of 
Egypt, 

And all the multitude thereof shall 
be destroyed. 

13I will destroy also all the beasts 
thereof 

From beside many waters; 

Neither shall the foot of man trouble 
them any more, 

Nor the hoofs of beasts trouble 
them. 

14Then will I make their waters to 
settle, 

And cause their rivers to run like oil, 

Saith the Lord GOD. 

15When I shall make the land of 
Egypt desolate and waste, 

A land destitute of that whereof it 
was full, 

When I shall smite all them that 
dwell therein, 


Then shall they know that I am the 
LORD. 

16This is the lamentation wherewith 
they shall lament; 

The daughters of the nations shall 
lament therewith; 

For Egypt, and for all her multitude, 
shall they lament therewith, 

Saith the Lord GOD.’ 

 

17It came to pass also in the twelfth 
year, in the fifteenth day of the month, 
that the word of the LORD came unto 
me, saying: 18’Son of man, wail for the 
multitude of Egypt, and cast them 
down, even her, with the daughters of 
the mighty nations, unto the nether 
parts of the earth, with them that go 
down into the pit. 

19Whom dost thou pass in beauty? 

Go down, and be thou laid with the 
uncircumcised. 

20They shall fall in the midst of them 
that are slain by the sword; she is 
delivered to the sword; draw her down 
and all her multitudes. 21The strong 
among the mighty shall speak of him 
out of the midst of the nether-world 
with them that helped him; they are 
gone down, they lie still, even the 
uncircumcised, slain by the sword. 
22Asshur is there and all her company; 
their graves are round about them; all 
of them slain, fallen by the sword; 
23whose graves are set in the uttermost 
parts of the pit, and her company is 
round about her grave; all of them 
slain, fallen by the sword, who caused 
terror in the land of the living. 24There 
is Elam and all her multitude round 
about her grave; all of them slain, 
fallen by the sword, who are gone 
down uncircumcised into the nether 
parts of the earth, who caused their 
terror in the land of the living; yet 
have they borne their shame with them 
that go down to the pit. 25They have 
set her a bed in the midst of the slain 
with all her multitude; her graves are 
round about them; all of them 
uncircumcised, slain by the sword; 
because their terror was caused in the 
land of the living, yet have they borne 
their shame with them that go down to 
the pit; they are put in the midst of 
them that are slain. 26There is 
Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude; 
her graves are round about them; all of 
them uncircumcised, slain by the 
sword; because they caused their terror 
in the land of the living. 27And they 
that are inferior to the uncircumcised 
shall not lie with the mighty that are 
gone down to the nether-world with 
their weapons of war, whose swords 
are laid under their heads, and whose 
iniquities are upon their bones; 
because the terror of the mighty was in 
the land of the living. 28But thou, in the 
midst of the uncircumcised shalt thou 
be broken and lie, even with them that 
are slain by the sword. 29There is 
Edom, her kings and all her princes, 
who for all their might are laid with 
them that are slain by the sword; they 
shall lie with the uncircumcised, and 
with them that go down to the pit. 
30There are the princes of the north, all 


of them, and all the Zidonians, who are 
gone down with the slain, ashamed for 
all the terror which they caused by 
their might, and they lie uncircumcised 
with them that are slain by the sword, 
and bear their shame with them that go 
down to the pit. 31These shall Pharaoh 
see, and shall be comforted over all his 
multitude; even Pharaoh and all his 
army, slain by the sword, saith the 
Lord GOD. 32For I have put My terror 
in the land of the living; and he shall 
be laid in the midst of the 
uncircumcised, with them that are 
slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and 
all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.’ 

 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, speak to the children of thy 
people, and say unto them: When I 
bring the sword upon a land, if the 
people of the land take a man from 
among them, and set him for their 
watchman; 3if, when he seeth the 
sword come upon the land, he blow 
the horn, and warn the people; 4then 
whosoever heareth the sound of the 
horn, and taketh not warning, if the 
sword come, and take him away, his 
blood shall be upon his own head; 5he 
heard the sound of the horn, and took 
not warning, his blood shall be upon 
him; whereas if he had taken warning, 
he would have delivered his soul. 6But 
if the watchman see the sword come, 
and blow not the horn, and the people 
be not warned, and the sword do come, 
and take any person from among them, 
he is taken away in his iniquity, but his 
blood will I require at the watchman’s 
hand. 

7So thou, son of man, I have set thee 
a watchman unto the house of Israel; 
therefore, when thou shalt hear the 
word at My mouth, warn them from 
Me. 8When I say unto the wicked: O 
wicked man, thou shalt surely die, and 
thou dost not speak to warn the wicked 
from his way; that wicked man shall 
die in his iniquity, but his blood will I 
require at thy hand. 9Nevertheless, if 
thou warn the wicked of his way to 
turn from it, and he turn not from his 
way; he shall die in his iniquity, but 
thou hast delivered thy soul. 

10Therefore, O thou son of man, say 
unto the house of Israel: Thus ye 
speak, saying: Our transgressions and 
our sins are upon us, and we pine away 
in them; how then can we live? 11Say 
unto them: As I live, saith the Lord 
GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of 
the wicked, but that the wicked turn 
from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye 
from your evil ways; for why will ye 
die, O house of Israel? 

12And thou, son of man, say unto the 
children of thy people: The 
righteousness of the righteous shall not 
deliver him in the day of his 
transgression; and as for the 
wickedness of the wicked, he shall not 
stumble thereby in the day that he 
turneth from his wickedness; neither 
shall he that is righteous be able to live 
thereby in the day that he sinneth. 
13When I say to the righteous, that he 
33 




shall surely live; if he trust to his 
righteousness, and commit iniquity, 
none of his righteous deeds shall be 
remembered; but for his iniquity that 
he hath committed, for it shall he die. 
14Again, when I say unto the wicked: 
Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from 
his sin, and do that which is lawful and 
right; 15if the wicked restore the 
pledge, give back that which he had 
taken by robbery, walk in the statutes 
of life, committing no iniquity; he 
shall surely live, he shall not die. 
16None of his sins that he hath 
committed shall be remembered 
against him; he hath done that which is 
lawful and right; he shall surely live. 
17Yet the children of thy people say: 
The way of the Lord is not equal; but 
as for them, their way is not equal. 
18When the righteous turneth from his 
righteousness, and committeth 
iniquity, he shall even die thereby. 
19And when the wicked turneth from 
his wickedness, and doeth that which 
is lawful and right, he shall live 
thereby. 20Yet ye say: The way of the 
Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, I 
will judge you every one after his 
ways.’ 

21And it came to pass in the twelfth 
year of our captivity, in the tenth 
month, in the fifth day of the month, 
that one that had escaped out of 
Jerusalem came unto me, saying: ‘The 
city is smitten.’ 22Now the hand of the 
LORD had been upon me in the 
evening, before he that was escaped 
came; and He had opened my mouth 
against his coming to me in the 
morning; and my mouth was opened, 
and I was no more dumb. 23Then the 
word of the LORD came unto me, 
saying: 24’Son of man, they that 
inhabit those waste places in the land 
of Israel speak, saying: Abraham was 
one, and he inherited the land; but we 
are many; the land is given us for 
inheritance. 25Wherefore say unto 
them: Thus saith the Lord GOD. Ye eat 
with the blood, and lift up your eyes 
unto your idols, and shed blood; and 
shall ye possess the land? 26Ye stand 
upon your sword, ye work 
abomination, and ye defile every one 
his neighbour’s wife; and shall ye 
possess the land? 27Thus shalt thou say 
unto them: Thus saith the Lord GOD: 
As I live, surely they that are in the 
waste places shall fall by the sword, 
and him that is in the open field will I 
give to the beasts to be devoured, and 
they that are in the strongholds and in 
the caves shall die of the pestilence. 
28And I will make the land most 
desolate, and the pride of her power 
shall cease; and the mountains of 
Israel shall be desolate, so that none 
shall pass through. 29Then shall they 
know that I am the LORD, when I have 
made the land most desolate, because 
of all their abominations which they 
have committed. 

30And as for thee, son of man, the 
children of thy people that talk of thee 
by the walls and in the doors of the 
houses, and speak one to another, 
every one to his brother, saying: 


Come, I pray you, and hear what is the 
word that cometh forth from the LORD; 
31and come unto thee as the people 
cometh, and sit before thee as My 
people, and hear thy words, but do 
them not—for with their mouth they 
show much love, but their heart goeth 
after their covetousness; 32and, lo, thou 
art unto them as a love song of one 
that hath a pleasant voice, and can play 
well on an instrument; so they hear thy 
words, but they do them not— 33when 
this cometh to pass—behold, it 
cometh—then shall they know that a 
prophet hath been among them.’ 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, prophesy against the 
shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say 
unto them, even to the shepherds: Thus 
saith the Lord GOD: Woe unto the 
shepherds of Israel that have fed 
themselves! should not the shepherds 
feed the sheep? 3Ye did eat the fat, and 
ye clothed you with the wool, ye killed 
the fatlings; but ye fed not the sheep. 
4The weak have ye not strengthened, 
neither have ye healed that which was 
sick, neither have ye bound up that 
which was broken, neither have ye 
brought back that which was driven 
away, neither have ye sought that 
which was lost; but with force have ye 
ruled over them and with rigour. 5So 
were they scattered, because there was 
no shepherd; and they became food to 
all the beasts of the field, and were 
scattered. 6My sheep wandered 
through all the mountains, and upon 
every high hill, yea, upon all the face 
of the earth were My sheep scattered, 
and there was none that did search or 
seek. 7Therefore, ye shepherds, hear 
the word of the LORD: 8As I live, saith 
the Lord GOD, surely forasmuch as My 
sheep became a prey, and My sheep 
became food to all the beasts of the 
field, because there was no shepherd, 
neither did My shepherds search for 
My sheep, but the shepherds fed 
themselves, and fed not My sheep; 
9therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word 
of the LORD: 10Thus saith the Lord 
GOD: Behold, I am against the 
shepherds; and I will require My sheep 
at their hand, and cause them to cease 
from feeding the sheep; neither shall 
the shepherds feed themselves any 
more; and I will deliver My sheep 
from their mouth, that they may not be 
food for them. 

11For thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Behold, here am I, and I will search 
for My sheep, and seek them out. 12As 
a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the 
day that he is among his sheep that are 
separated, so will I seek out My sheep; 
and I will deliver them out of all 
places whither they have been 
scattered in the day of clouds and thick 
darkness. 13And I will bring them out 
from the peoples, and gather them 
from the countries, and will bring them 
into their own land; and I will feed 
them upon the mountains of Israel, by 
the streams, and in all the habitable 
places of the country. 14I will feed 
them in a good pasture, and upon the 
34 




high mountains of Israel shall their 
fold be; there shall they lie down in a 
good fold, and in a fat pasture shall 
they feed upon the mountains of Israel. 
15I will feed My sheep, and I will 
cause them to lie down, saith the Lord 
GOD. 16I will seek that which was lost, 
and will bring back that which was 
driven away, and will bind up that 
which was broken, and will strengthen 
that which was sick; and the fat and 
the strong I will destroy, I will feed 
them in justice. 17And as for you, O 
My flock, thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Behold, I judge between cattle and 
cattle, even the rams and the he-goats. 
18Seemeth it a small thing unto you to 
have fed upon the good pasture, but ye 
must tread down with your feet the 
residue of your pasture? and to have 
drunk of the settled waters, but ye 
must foul the residue with your feet? 
19And as for My sheep, they eat that 
which ye have trodden with your feet, 
and they drink that which ye have 
fouled with your feet. 

20Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD 
unto them: Behold, I, even I, will 
judge between the fat cattle and the 
lean cattle. 21Because ye thrust with 
side and with shoulder, and push all 
the weak with your horns, till ye have 
scattered them abroad; 22therefore will 
I save My flock, and they shall no 
more be a prey; and I will judge 
between cattle and cattle. 23And I will 
set up one shepherd over them, and he 
shall feed them, even My servant 
David; he shall feed them, and he shall 
be their shepherd. 24And I the LORD 
will be their God, and My servant 
David prince among them; I the LORD 
have spoken. 25And I will make with 
them a covenant of peace, and will 
cause evil beasts to cease out of the 
land; and they shall dwell safely in the 
wilderness, and sleep in the woods. 
26And I will make them and the places 
round about My hill a blessing; and I 
will cause the shower to come down in 
its season; there shall be showers of 
blessing. 27And the tree of the field 
shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall 
yield her produce, and they shall be 
safe in their land; and they shall know 
that I am the LORD, when I have 
broken the bars of their yoke, and have 
delivered them out of the hand of those 
that made bondmen of them. 28And 
they shall no more be a prey to the 
nations, neither shall the beast of the 
earth devour them; but they shall dwell 
safely, and none shall make them 
afraid. 29And I will raise up unto them 
a plantation for renown, and they shall 
be no more consumed with hunger in 
the land, neither bear the shame of the 
nations any more. 30And they shall 
know that I the LORD their God am 
with them, and that they, the house of 
Israel, are My people, saith the Lord 
GOD. 31And ye My sheep, the sheep of 
My pasture, are men, and I am your 
God, saith the Lord GOD.’ 

 

Moreover the word of the 
LORD came unto me, saying: 
2’Son of man, set thy face against 
35 




mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 
3and say unto it: Thus saith the Lord 
GOD: Behold, I am against thee, O 
mount Seir, and I will stretch out My 
hand against thee, and I will make thee 
most desolate. 4I will lay thy cities 
waste, and thou shalt be desolate; and 
thou shalt know that I am the LORD. 
5Because thou hast had a hatred of old, 
and hast hurled the children of Israel 
unto the power of the sword in the 
time of their calamity, in the time of 
the iniquity of the end; 6therefore, as I 
live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare 
thee unto blood, and blood shall 
pursue thee; surely thou hast hated 
thine own blood, therefore blood shall 
pursue thee. 7Thus will I make mount 
Seir most desolate, and cut off from it 
him that passeth through and him that 
returneth. 8And I will fill his 
mountains with his slain; in thy hills 
and in thy valleys and in all thy 
streams shall they fall that are slain 
with the sword. 9I will make thee 
perpetual desolations, and thy cities 
shall not return; and ye shall know that 
I am the LORD. 10Because thou hast 
said: These two nations and these two 
countries shall be mine, and we will 
possess it; whereas the LORD was there; 
11therefore, as I live, saith the Lord 
GOD, I will do according to thine anger 
and according to thine envy, which 
thou hast used out of thy hatred against 
them; and I will make Myself known 
among them, when I shall judge thee. 
12And thou shalt know that I the LORD 
have heard all thy blasphemies which 
thou hast spoken against the mountains 
of Israel, saying: They are laid 
desolate, they are given us to devour. 
13And ye have magnified yourselves 
against Me with your mouth, and have 
multiplied your words against Me; I 
have heard it. 14Thus saith the Lord 
GOD: When the whole earth rejoiceth, I 
will make thee desolate. 15As thou 
didst rejoice over the inheritance of the 
house of Israel, because it was 
desolate, so will I do unto thee; thou 
shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all 
Edom, even all of it; and they shall 
know that I am the LORD. 

 

And thou, son of man, 
prophesy unto the mountains 
of Israel, and say: Ye mountains of 
Israel, hear the word of the LORD. 
2Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because the 
enemy hath said against you: Aha! 
even the ancient high places are ours 
in possession; 3therefore prophesy, and 
say: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Because, 
even because they have made you 
desolate, and swallowed you up on 
every side, that ye might be a 
possession unto the rest of the nations, 
and ye are taken up in the lips of 
talkers, and the evil report of the 
people; 4therefore, ye mountains of 
Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD to the 
mountains and to the hills, to the 
streams and to the valleys, to the 
desolate wastes and to the cities that 
are forsaken, which are become a prey 
and derision to the residue of the 
36 




nations that are round about; 5therefore 
thus saith the Lord GOD: Surely in the 
fire of My jealousy have I spoken 
against the residue of the nations, and 
against all Edom, that have appointed 
My land unto themselves for a 
possession with the joy of all their 
heart, with disdain of soul, to cast it 
out for a prey; 6therefore prophesy 
concerning the land of Israel, and say 
unto the mountains and to the hills, to 
the streams and to the valleys: Thus 
saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I have 
spoken in My jealousy and in My fury, 
because ye have borne the shame of 
the nations; 7therefore thus saith the 
Lord GOD: I have lifted up My hand: 
Surely the nations that are round about 
you, they shall bear their shame. 8But 
ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall 
shoot forth your branches, and yield 
your fruit to My people Israel; for they 
are at hand to come. 9For, behold, I am 
for you, and I will turn unto you, and 
ye shall be tilled and sown; 10and I will 
multiply men upon you, all the house 
of Israel, even all of it; and the cities 
shall be inhabited, and the waste 
places shall be builded; 11and I will 
multiply upon you man and beast, and 
they shall increase and be fruitful; and 
I will cause you to be inhabited after 
your former estate, and will do better 
unto you than at your beginnings; and 
ye shall know that I am the LORD. 
12Yea, I will cause men to walk upon 
you, even my people Israel, and they 
shall possess thee, and thou shalt be 
their inheritance; and thou shalt no 
more henceforth bereave them of 
children. 13Thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Because they say unto you: Thou land 
art a devourer of men, and hast been a 
bereaver of thy nations; 14therefore 
thou shalt devour men no more, 
neither bereave thy nations any more, 
saith the Lord GOD; 15neither will I 
suffer the shame of the nations any 
more to be heard against thee, neither 
shalt thou bear the reproach of the 
peoples any more, neither shalt thou 
cause thy nations to stumble any more, 
saith the Lord GOD.’ 

16Moreover the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 17’Son of man, 
when the house of Israel dwelt in their 
own land, they defiled it by their way 
and by their doings; their way before 
Me was as the uncleanness of a 
woman in her impurity. 18Wherefore I 
poured out My fury upon them for the 
blood which they had shed upon the 
land, and because they had defiled it 
with their idols; 19and I scattered them 
among the nations, and they were 
dispersed through the countries; 
according to their way and according 
to their doings I judged them. 20And 
when they came unto the nations, 
whither they came, they profaned My 
holy name; in that men said of them: 
These are the people of the LORD, and 
are gone forth out of His land. 21But I 
had pity for My holy name, which the 
house of Israel had profaned among 
the nations, whither they came. 
22Therefore say unto the house of 
Israel: Thus saith the Lord GOD: I do 


not this for your sake, O house of 
Israel, but for My holy name, which ye 
have profaned among the nations, 
whither ye came. 23And I will sanctify 
My great name, which hath been 
profaned among the nations, which ye 
have profaned in the midst of them; 
and the nations shall know that I am 
the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I 
shall be sanctified in you before their 
eyes. 24For I will take you from among 
the nations, and gather you out of all 
the countries, and will bring you into 
your own land. 25And I will sprinkle 
clean water upon you, and ye shall be 
clean; from all your uncleannesses, 
and from all your idols, will I cleanse 
you. 26A new heart also will I give 
you, and a new spirit will I put within 
you; and I will take away the stony 
heart out of your flesh, and I will give 
you a heart of flesh. 27And I will put 
My spirit within you, and cause you to 
walk in My statutes, and ye shall keep 
Mine ordinances, and do them. 28And 
ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to 
your fathers; and ye shall be My 
people, and I will be your God. 29And I 
will save you from all your 
uncleannesses; and I will call for the 
corn, and will increase it, and lay no 
famine upon you. 30And I will multiply 
the fruit of the tree, and the increase of 
the field, that ye may receive no more 
the reproach of famine among the 
nations. 31Then shall ye remember 
your evil ways, and your doings that 
were not good; and ye shall loathe 
yourselves in your own sight for your 
iniquities and for your abominations. 
32Not for your sake do I this, saith the 
Lord GOD, be it known unto you; be 
ashamed and confounded for your 
ways, O house of Israel. 

33Thus saith the Lord GOD: In the 
day that I cleanse you from all your 
iniquities, I will cause the cities to be 
inhabited, and the waste places shall 
be builded. 34And the land that was 
desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was 
a desolation in the sight of all that 
passed by. 35And they shall say: This 
land that was desolate is become like 
the garden of Eden; and the waste and 
desolate and ruined cities are fortified 
and inhabited. 36Then the nations that 
are left round about you shall know 
that I the LORD have builded the ruined 
places, and planted that which was 
desolate; I the LORD have spoken it, 
and I will do it. 

37Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will yet 
for this be inquired of by the house of 
Israel, to do it for them; I will increase 
them with men like a flock. 38As the 
flock for sacrifice, as the flock of 
Jerusalem in her appointed seasons, so 
shall the waste cities be filled with 
flocks of men; and they shall know 
that I am the LORD.’ 

 

The hand of the LORD was 
upon me, and the LORD carried 
me out in a spirit, and set me down in 
the midst of the valley, and it was full 
of bones; 2and He caused me to pass 
by them round about, and, behold, 
there were very many in the open 
37 




valley; and, lo, they were very dry. 
3And He said unto me: ‘Son of man, 
can these bones live?’ And I answered: 
‘O Lord GOD, Thou knowest.’ 4Then 
He said unto me: ‘Prophesy over these 
bones, and say unto them: O ye dry 
bones, hear the word of the LORD: 
5Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these 
bones: Behold, I will cause breath to 
enter into you, and ye shall live. 6And I 
will lay sinews upon you, and will 
bring up flesh upon you, and cover 
you with skin, and put breath in you, 
and ye shall live; and ye shall know 
that I am the LORD.’ 7So I prophesied 
as I was commanded; and as I 
prophesied, there was a noise, and 
behold a commotion, and the bones 
came together, bone to its bone. 8And I 
beheld, and, lo, there were sinews 
upon them, and flesh came up, and 
skin covered them above; but there 
was no breath in them. 9Then said He 
unto me: ‘Prophesy unto the breath, 
prophesy, son of man, and say to the 
breath: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Come 
from the four winds, O breath, and 
breathe upon these slain, that they may 
live.’ 10So I prophesied as He 
commanded me, and the breath came 
into them, and they lived, and stood up 
upon their feet, an exceeding great 
host. 11Then He said unto me: ‘Son of 
man, these bones are the whole house 
of Israel; behold, they say: Our bones 
are dried up, and our hope is lost; we 
are clean cut off. 12Therefore 
prophesy, and say unto them: Thus 
saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open 
your graves, and cause you to come up 
out of your graves, O My people; and I 
will bring you into the land of Israel. 
13And ye shall know that I am the 
LORD, when I have opened your 
graves, and caused you to come up out 
of your graves, O My people. 14And I 
will put My spirit in you, and ye shall 
live, and I will place you in your own 
land; and ye shall know that I the LORD 
have spoken, and performed it, saith 
the LORD.’ 

15And the word of the LORD came 
unto me, saying: 16’And thou, son of 
man, take thee one stick, and write 
upon it: For Judah, and for the children 
of Israel his companions; then take 
another stick, and write upon it: For 
Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and of all 
the house of Israel his companions; 
17and join them for thee one to another 
into one stick, that they may become 
one in thy hand. 18And when the 
children of thy people shall speak unto 
thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what 
thou meanest by these? 19say into 
them: Thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, 
which is in the hand of Ephraim, and 
the tribes of Israel his companions; 
and I will put them unto him together 
with the stick of Judah, and make them 
one stick, and they shall be one in My 
hand. 20And the sticks whereon thou 
writest shall be in thy hand before their 
eyes. 21And say unto them: Thus saith 
the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the 
children of Israel from among the 
nations, whither they are gone, and 


will gather them on every side, and 
bring them into their own land; 22and I 
will make them one nation in the land, 
upon the mountains of Israel, and one 
king shall be king to them all; and they 
shall be no more two nations, neither 
shall they be divided into two 
kingdoms any more at all; 23neither 
shall they defile themselves any more 
with their idols, nor with their 
detestable things, nor with any of their 
transgressions; but I will save them out 
of all their dwelling-places, wherein 
they have sinned, and will cleanse 
them; so shall they be My people, and 
I will be their God. 24And My servant 
David shall be king over them, and 
they all shall have one shepherd; they 
shall also walk in Mine ordinances, 
and observe My statutes, and do them. 
25And they shall dwell in the land that 
I have given unto Jacob My servant, 
wherein your fathers dwelt; and they 
shall dwell therein, they, and their 
children, and their children’s children, 
for ever; and David My servant shall 
be their prince for ever. 26Moreover I 
will make a covenant of peace with 
them—it shall be an everlasting 
covenant with them; and I will 
establish them, and multiply them, and 
will set My sanctuary in the midst of 
them for ever. 27My dwelling-place 
also shall be over them; and I will be 
their God, and they shall be My 
people. 28And the nations shall know 
that I am the LORD that sanctify Israel, 
when My sanctuary shall be in the 
midst of them for ever.’ 

 

And the word of the LORD 
came unto me, saying: 2’Son 
of man, set thy face toward Gog, of the 
land of Magog, the chief prince of 
Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy 
against him, 3and say: Thus saith the 
Lord GOD: Behold, I am against thee, 
O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and 
Tubal; 4and I will turn thee about, and 
put hooks into thy jaws, and I will 
bring thee forth, and all thine army, 
horses and horsemen, all of them 
clothed most gorgeously, a great 
company with buckler and shield, all 
of them handling swords: 5Persia, 
Cush, and Put with them, all of them 
with shield and helmet; 6Gomer, and 
all his bands; the house of Togarmah 
in the uttermost parts of the north, and 
all his bands; even many peoples with 
thee. 7Be thou prepared, and prepare 
for thyself, thou, and all thy company 
that are assembled unto thee, and be 
thou guarded of them. 8After many 
days thou shalt be mustered for 
service, in the latter years thou shalt 
come against the land that is brought 
back from the sword, that is gathered 
out of many peoples, against the 
mountains of Israel, which have been a 
continual waste; but it is brought forth 
out of the peoples, and they dwell 
safely all of them. 9And thou shalt 
ascend, thou shalt come like a storm, 
thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the 
land, thou, and all thy bands, and 
many peoples with thee. 
38 




10Thus saith the Lord GOD: It shall 
come to pass in that day, that things 
shall come into thy mind, and thou 
shalt devise an evil device; 11and thou 
shalt say: I will go up against the land 
of unwalled villages; I will come upon 
them that are at quiet, that dwell 
safely, all of them dwelling without 
walls, and having neither bars nor 
gates; 12to take the spoil and to take the 
prey; to turn thy hand against the 
waste places that are now inhabited, 
and against the people that are 
gathered out of the nations, that have 
gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in 
the middle of the earth. 13Sheba, and 
Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, 
with all the magnates thereof, shall say 
unto thee: Comest thou to take the 
spoil? hast thou assembled thy 
company to take the prey? to carry 
away silver and gold, to take away 
cattle and goods, to take great spoil? 

14Therefore, son of man, prophesy, 
and say unto Gog: Thus saith the Lord 
GOD: In that day when My people 
Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not 
know it? 15And thou shalt come from 
thy place out of the uttermost parts of 
the north, thou, and many peoples with 
thee, all of them riding upon horses, a 
great company and a mighty army; 
16and thou shalt come up against My 
people Israel, as a cloud to cover the 
land; it shall be in the end of days, and 
I will bring thee against My land, that 
the nations may know Me, when I 
shall be sanctified through thee, O 
Gog, before their eyes. 

17Thus saith the Lord GOD: Art thou 
he of whom I spoke in old time by My 
servants the prophets of Israel, that 
prophesied in those days for many 
years, that I would bring thee against 
them? 18And it shall come to pass in 
that day, when Gog shall come against 
the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, 
that My fury shall arise up in My 
nostrils. 19For in My jealousy and in 
the fire of My wrath have I spoken: 
Surely in that day there shall be a great 
shaking in the land of Israel; 20so that 
the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of 
the heaven, and the beasts of the field 
and all creeping things that creep upon 
the ground, and all the men that are 
upon the face of the earth, shall shake 
at My presence, and the mountains 
shall be thrown down, and the steep 
places shall fall, and every wall shall 
fall to the ground. 21And I will call for 
a sword against him throughout all my 
mountains, saith the Lord GOD; every 
man’s sword shall be against his 
brother. 22And I will plead against him 
with pestilence and with blood; and I 
will cause to rain upon him, and upon 
his bands, and upon the many peoples 
that are with him, an overflowing 
shower, and great hailstones, fire, and 
brimstone. 23Thus will I magnify 
Myself, and sanctify Myself, and I will 
make Myself known in the eyes of 
many nations; and they shall know that 
I am the LORD. 

And thou, son of man, 
prophesy against Gog, and 
say: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, 
39 




I am against thee, O Gog, chief prince 
of Meshech and Tubal; 2and I will turn 
thee about and lead thee on, and will 
cause thee to come up from the 
uttermost parts of the north; and I will 
bring thee upon the mountains of 
Israel; 3and I will smite thy bow out of 
thy left hand, and will cause thine 
arrows to fall out of thy right hand. 
4Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of 
Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the 
peoples that are with thee; I will give 
thee unto the ravenous birds of every 
sort and to the beasts of the field, to be 
devoured. 5Thou shalt fall upon the 
open field; for I have spoken it, saith 
the Lord GOD. 6And I will send a fire 
on Magog, and on them that dwell 
safely in the isles; and they shall know 
that I am the LORD. 7And My holy 
name will I make known in the midst 
of My people Israel; neither will I 
suffer My holy name to be profaned 
any more; and the nations shall know 
that I am the LORD, the Holy One in 
Israel. 8Behold, it cometh, and it shall 
be done, saith the Lord GOD; This is 
the day whereof I have spoken. 9And 
they that dwell in the cities of Israel 
shall go forth, and shall make fires of 
the weapons and use them as fuel, both 
the shields and the bucklers, the bows 
and the arrows, and the hand-staves, 
and the spears, and they shall make 
fires of them seven years; 10so that 
they shall take no wood out of the 
field, neither cut down any out of the 
forests, for they shall make fires of the 
weapons; and they shall spoil those 
that spoiled them, and rob those that 
robbed them, saith the Lord GOD. 

11And it shall come to pass in that 
day, that I will give unto Gog a place 
fit for burial in Israel, the valley of 
them that pass through on the east of 
the sea; and it shall stop them that pass 
through; and there shall they bury Gog 
and all his multitude; and they shall 
call it the valley of aHamon-gog. 12And 
seven months shall the house of Israel 
be burying them, that they may cleanse 
the land. 13Yea, all the people of the 
land shall bury them, and it shall be to 
them a renown; in the day that I shall 
be glorified, saith the Lord GOD. 14And 
they shall set apart men of continual 
employment, that shall pass through 
the land to bury with them that pass 
through those that remain upon the 
face of the land, to cleanse it; after the 
end of seven months shall they search. 
15And when they that pass through 
shall pass through the land, and any 
seeth a man’s bone, then shall he set 
up a sign by it, till the buriers have 
buried it in the valley of Hamon-gog. 
16And bHamonah shall also be the 
name of a city. Thus shall they cleanse 
the land. 

a That is, The multitude of Gog. 

b That is, Multitude. 

17And thou, son of man, thus saith 
the Lord GOD: Speak unto the birds of 
every sort, and to every beast of the 
field: Assemble yourselves, and come; 
gather yourselves on every side to My 
feast that I do prepare for you, even a 


great feast, upon the mountains of 
Israel, that ye may eat flesh and drink 
blood. 18The flesh of the mighty shall 
ye eat, and the blood of the princes of 
the earth shall ye drink; rams, lambs, 
and goats, bullocks, fatlings of Bashan 
are they all of them. 19And ye shall eat 
fat till ye be full, and drink blood till 
ye be drunken, of My feast which I 
have prepared for you. 20And ye shall 
be filled at My table with horses and 
horsemen, with mighty men, and with 
all men of war, saith the Lord GOD. 
21And I will set My glory among the 
nations, and all the nations shall see 
My judgment that I have executed, and 
My hand that I have laid upon them. 
22So the house of Israel shall know that 
I am the LORD their God, from that day 
and forward. 23And the nations shall 
know that the house of Israel went into 
captivity for their iniquity, because 
they broke faith with Me, and I hid My 
face from them; so I gave them into 
the hand of their adversaries, and they 
fell all of them by the sword. 
24According to their uncleanness and 
according to their transgressions did I 
unto them; and I hid My face from 
them. 

25Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: 
Now will I bring back the captivity of 
Jacob, and have compassion upon the 
whole house of Israel; and I will be 
jealous for My holy name. 26And they 
shall bear their shame, and all their 
breach of faith which they have 
committed against Me, when they 
shall dwell safely in their land, and 
none shall make them afraid; 27when I 
have brought them back from the 
peoples, and gathered them out of their 
enemies’lands, and am sanctified in 
them in the sight of many nations. 
28And they shall know that I am the 
LORD their God, in that I caused them 
to go into captivity among the nations, 
and have gathered them unto their own 
land; and I will leave none of them any 
more there; 29neither will I hide My 
face any more from them; for I have 
poured out My spirit upon the house of 
Israel, saith the Lord GOD.’ 

 

In the five and twentieth year 
of our captivity, in the 
beginning of the year, in the tenth day 
of the month, in the fourteenth year 
after that the city was smitten, in the 
selfsame day, the hand of the LORD 
was upon me, and He brought me 
thither. 2In the visions of God brought 
He me into the land of Israel, and set 
me down upon a very high mountain, 
whereon was as it were the frame of a 
city on the south. 3And He brought me 
thither, and, behold, there was a man, 
whose appearance was like the 
appearance of brass, with a line of flax 
in his hand, and a measuring reed; and 
he stood in the gate. 4And the man said 
unto me: ‘Son of man, behold with 
thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, 
and set thy heart upon all that I shall 
show thee, for to the intent that I might 
show them unto thee art thou brought 
thither; declare all that thou seest to 
the house of Israel.’ 
40 




5And behold a wall on the outside of 
the house round about, and in the 
man’s hand a measuring reed of six 
cubits long, of a cubit and a hand-
breadth each; so he measured the 
breadth of the building, one reed, and 
the height, one reed. 

6Then came he unto the gate which 
looketh toward the east, and went up 
the steps thereof; and he measured the 
jamb of the gate, one reed broad, and 
the other jamb, one reed broad. 7And 
every cell was one reed long, and one 
reed broad; and the space between the 
cells was five cubits; and the jambs of 
the gate by the porch of the gate within 
were one reed. 8He measured also the 
porch of the gate toward the house, 
one reed. 9Then measured he the porch 
of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts 
thereof, two cubits; and the porch of 
the gate was inward. 10And the cells of 
the gate eastward were three on this 
side, and three on that side; they three 
were of one measure; and the posts 
had one measure on this side and on 
that side. 11And he measured the 
breadth of the entry of the gate, ten 
cubits; and the length of the gate, 
thirteen cubits; 12and a border before 
the cells, one cubit [on this side], and a 
border, one cubit on that side; and the 
cells, six cubits on this side, and six 
cubits on that side. 13And he measured 
the gate from the roof of the one cell to 
the roof of the other, a breadth of five 
and twenty cubits; door against door. 
14He made also posts of threescore 
cubits; even unto the posts of the court 
in the gates round about. 15And from 
the forefront of the gate of the entrance 
unto the forefront of the inner porch of 
the gate were fifty cubits. 16And there 
were narrow windows to the cells and 
to their posts within the gate round 
about, and likewise to the arches; and 
windows were round about inward; 
and upon each post were palm-trees. 

17Then brought he me into the outer 
court, and, lo, there were chambers 
and a pavement, made for the court 
round about; thirty chambers were 
upon the pavement. 18And the 
pavement was by the side of the gates, 
corresponding unto the length of the 
gates, even the lower pavement. 
19Then he measured the breadth from 
the forefront of the lower gate unto the 
forefront of the inner court without, a 
hundred cubits, eastward as also 
northward. 

20And the gate of the outer court that 
looked toward the north, he measured 
the length thereof and the breadth 
thereof. 21And the cells thereof were 
three on this side and three on that 
side; and the posts thereof and the 
arches thereof were after the measure 
of the first gate; the length thereof was 
fifty cubits, and the breadth five and 
twenty cubits. 22And the windows 
thereof, and the arches thereof, and the 
palm-trees thereof, were after the 
measure of the gate that looketh 
toward the east; and it was ascended 
by seven steps; and the arches thereof 
were before them. 23And there was a 
gate to the inner court over against the 


other gate, northward as also eastward; 
and he measured from gate to gate a 
hundred cubits. 

24And he led me toward the south, 
and behold a gate toward the south; 
and he measured the posts thereof, and 
the arches thereof according to these 
measures. 25And there were windows 
in it and in the arches thereof round 
about, like those windows; the length 
was fifty cubits, and the breadth five 
and twenty cubits. 26And there were 
seven steps to go up to it, and the 
arches thereof were before them; and it 
had palm-trees, one on this side, and 
another on that side, upon the posts 
thereof. 27And there was a gate to the 
inner court toward the south; and he 
measured from gate to gate toward the 
south a hundred cubits. 

28Then he brought me to the inner 
court by the south gate; and he 
measured the south gate according to 
these measures; 29and the cells thereof, 
and the posts thereof, and the arches 
thereof, according to these measures; 
and there were windows in it and in 
the arches thereof round about; it was 
fifty cubits long, and five and twenty 
cubits broad. 30And there were arches 
round about, five and twenty cubits 
long, and five cubits broad. 31And the 
arches thereof were toward the outer 
court; and palm-trees were upon the 
posts thereof; and the going up to it 
had eight steps. 

32And he brought me into the inner 
court toward the east; and he measured 
the gate according to these measures; 
33and the cells thereof, and the posts 
thereof, and the arches thereof, 
according to these measures; and there 
were windows therein and in the 
arches thereof round about; it was fifty 
cubits long, and five and twenty cubits 
broad. 34And the arches thereof were 
toward the outer court; and palm-trees 
were upon the posts thereof, on this 
side, and on that side; and the going up 
to it had eight steps. 

35And he brought me to the north 
gate; and he measured it according to 
these measures; 36the cells thereof, the 
posts thereof, and the arches thereof; 
and there were windows therein round 
about; the length was fifty cubits, and 
the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
37And the posts thereof were toward 
the outer court; and palm-trees were 
upon the posts thereof, on this side, 
and on that side; and the going up to it 
had eight steps. 

38And a chamber with the entry 
thereof was by the posts at the gates; 
there was the burnt-offering to be 
washed. 39And in the porch of the gate 
were two tables on this side, and two 
tables on that side, to slay thereon the 
burnt-offering and the sin-offering and 
the guilt-offering. 40And on the one 
side without, as one goeth up to the 
entry of the gate toward the north, 
were two tables; and on the other side 
of the porch of the gate were two 
tables. 41Four tables were on this side, 
and four tables on that side, by the side 
of the gate; eight tables, whereupon to 
slay the sacrifices. 42Moreover there 


were four tables for the burnt-offering, 
of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, 
and a cubit and a half broad, and one 
cubit high, whereupon to lay the 
instruments wherewith the burnt-
offering and the sacrifice are slain. 
43And the slabs, a handbreadth long, 
were fastened within round about; and 
upon the tables was to be the flesh of 
the offering. 44And without the inner 
gate were chambers for the guard in 
the inner court, which was at the side 
of the north gate, and their prospect 
was toward the south; one at the side 
of the east gate having the prospect 
toward the north. 45And he said unto 
me: ‘This chamber, whose prospect is 
toward the south, is for the priests, the 
keepers of the charge of the house. 
46And the chamber whose prospect is 
toward the north is for the priests, the 
keepers of the charge of the altar; these 
are the sons of Zadok, who from 
among the sons of Levi come near to 
the LORD to minister unto Him.’ 

47And he measured the court, a 
hundred cubits long, and a hundred 
cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar 
was before the house. 

48Then he brought me to the porch 
of the house, and measured each post 
of the porch, five cubits on this side, 
and five cubits on that side; and the 
breadth of the gate was three cubits on 
this side, and three cubits on that side. 
49The length of the porch was twenty 
cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; 
and it was by steps that it was 
ascended; and there were pillars by the 
posts, one on this side, and another on 
that side. 

41 



And he brought me to athe 
temple, and measured the 
posts, six cubits broad on the one side, 
and six cubits broad on the other side, 
which was the breadth of the tent. 
2And the breadth of the entrance was 
ten cubits; and the sides of the 
entrance were five cubits on the one 
side, and five cubits on the other side; 
and he measured the length thereof, 
forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty 
cubits. 

a That is, the holy place. 

3Then went he inward, and 
measured each post of the entrance, 
two cubits; and the entrance, six 
cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, 
seven cubits. 4And he measured the 
length thereof, twenty cubits, and the 
breadth, twenty cubits, before the 
temple; and he said unto me: ‘This is 
the most holy place.’ 

5Then he measured the wall of the 
house, six cubits; and the breadth of 
every side-chamber, four cubits, round 
about the house on every side. 6And 
the side-chambers were one over 
another, three and thirty times; and 
there were cornices in the wall which 
belonged to the house for the side-
chambers round about, that they might 
have hold therein, and not have hold in 
the wall of the house. 7And the side-
chambers were broader as they wound 
about higher and higher; for the 
winding about of the house went 


higher and higher round about the 
house; therefore the breadth of the 
house continued upward; and so one 
went up from the lowest row to the 
highest by the middle. 8I saw also that 
the house had a raised basement round 
about; the foundations of the side-
chambers were a full reed of six cubits 
to the joining. 9The breadth of the 
outer wall which belonged to the side-
chambers was five cubits; and so that 
which was left by the structure of the 
side-chambers that belonged to the 
house. 10And between the chambers 
was a breadth of twenty cubits round 
about the house on every side. 11And 
the doors of the side-chambers were 
toward the place that was left, one 
door toward the north, and another 
door toward the south; and the breadth 
of the place that was left was five 
cubits round about. 

12And the building that was before 
the separate place at the side toward 
the west was seventy cubits broad; and 
the wall of the building was five cubits 
thick round about, and the length 
thereof ninety cubits. 

13And he measured the house, a 
hundred cubits long; and the separate 
place, and the building, with the walls 
thereof, a hundred cubits long; 14also 
the breadth of the face of the house 
and of the separate place toward the 
east, a hundred cubits. 15And he 
measured the length of the building 
before the separate place which was at 
the back thereof, and the galleries 
thereof on the one side and on the 
other side, a hundred cubits. 

Now the temple, and the inner place, 
and the porches of the court, 16the 
jambs, and the narrow windows, and 
the galleries, that they three had round 
about, over against the jambs there 
was a veneering of wood round about, 
and from the ground up to the 
windows; and the windows were 
covered; 17to the space above the door, 
even unto the inner house, and 
without, and on all the wall round 
about within and without, by measure. 
18And it was made with cherubim and 
palm-trees; and a palm-tree was 
between cherub and cherub, and every 
cherub had two faces; 19so that there 
was the face of a man toward the 
palm-tree on the one side, and the face 
of a young lion toward the palm-tree 
on the other side; thus was it made 
through all the house round about. 
20From the ground unto above the door 
were cherubim and palm-trees made; 
and so on the wall of the temple. 21As 
for the temple, the jambs were 
squared; and the face of the sanctuary 
had an appearance such as is the 
appearance. 

22The altar, three cubits high, and 
the length thereof two cubits, was of 
wood, and so the corners thereof; the 
length thereof, and the walls thereof, 
were also of wood; and he said unto 
me: ‘This is the table that is before the 
LORD.’ 

23And the temple and the sanctuary 
had two doors. 24And the doors had 


two leaves [apiece], two turning 
leaves; two leaves for the one door, 
and two leaves for the other. 25And 
there were made on them, on the doors 
of the temple, cherubim and palm-
trees, like as were made upon the 
walls; and there were thick beams of 
wood upon the face of the porch 
without. 26And there were narrow 
windows and palm-trees on the one 
side and on the other side, on the sides 
of the porch; there were also the 
brackets of the house, and the thick 
beams. 

Then he brought me forth into 
the outer court, the way 
toward the north; and he brought me 
into the chamber that was over against 
the separate place, and which was over 
against the building, toward the north, 
2even to the front of the length of a 
hundred cubits, with the door on the 
north, and the breadth of fifty cubits, 
3over against the twenty cubits which 
belonged to the inner court, and over 
against the pavement which belonged 
to the outer court; with gallery against 
gallery in three stories. 4And before 
the chambers was a walk of ten cubits 
breadth inward, a way of one cubit; 
and their doors were toward the north. 
5Now the upper chambers were 
shorter; for the galleries took away 
from these, more than from the lower 
and the middlemost, in the building. 
6For they were in three stories, and 
they had not pillars as the pillars of the 
courts; therefore room was taken away 
from the lowest and the middlemost, in 
comparison with the ground. 7And the 
wall that was without by the side of 
the chambers, toward the outer court in 
front of the chambers, the length 
thereof was fifty cubits. 8For the length 
of the chambers that were toward the 
outer court was fifty cubits; and, lo, 
before the temple were a hundred 
cubits. 9And from under these 
chambers was the entry on the east 
side, as one goeth into them from the 
outer court. 10In the breadth of the wall 
of the court toward the east, before the 
separate place, and before the building, 
there were chambers, 11with a way 
before them; like the appearance of the 
chambers which were toward the 
north, as long as they, and as broad as 
they, with all their goings out, and 
according to their fashions; and as 
their doors, 12so were also the doors of 
the chambers that were toward the 
south, there was a door in the head of 
the way, even the way directly before 
the wall, toward the way from the east, 
as one entereth into them. 

13Then said he unto me: ‘The north 
chambers and the south chambers, 
which are before the separate place, 
they are the holy chambers, where the 
priests that are near unto the LORD 
shall eat the most holy things; there 
shall they lay the most holy things, and 
the meal-offering, and the sin-offering, 
and the guilt-offering; for the place is 
holy. 14When the priests enter in, then 
shall they not go out of the holy place 
into the outer court, but there they 
shall lay their garments wherein they 
42 




minister, for they are holy; and they 
shall put on other garments, and shall 
approach to that which pertaineth to 
the people.’ 

15Now when he had made an end of 
measuring the inner house, he brought 
me forth by the way of the gate whose 
prospect is toward the east, and 
measured it round about. 16He 
measured the east side with the 
measuring reed, five hundred reeds, 
with the measuring reed round about. 
17He measured the north side, five 
hundred reeds, with the measuring 
reed round about. 18He measured the 
south side, five hundred reeds, with 
the measuring reed. 19He turned about 
to the west side, and measured five 
hundred reeds with the measuring 
reed. 20He measured it by the four 
sides; it had a wall round about, the 
length five hundred, and the breadth 
five hundred, to make a separation 
between that which was holy and that 
which was common. 

Afterward he brought me to 
the gate, even the gate that 
looketh toward the east; 2and, behold, 
the glory of the God of Israel came 
from the way of the east; and His 
voice was like the sound of many 
waters; and the earth did shine with 
His glory. 3And the appearance of the 
vision which I saw was like the vision 
that I saw when I came to destroy the 
city; and the visions were like the 
vision that I saw by the river Chebar; 
and I fell upon my face. 4And the glory 
of the LORD came into the house by the 
way of the gate whose prospect is 
toward the east. 5And a spirit took me 
up, and brought me into the inner 
court; and, behold, the glory of the 
LORD filled the house. 6And I heard 
one speaking unto me out of the house; 
and a man stood by me. 7And He said 
unto me: ‘Son of man, this is the place 
of My throne, and the place of the 
soles of My feet, where I will dwell in 
the midst of the children of Israel for 
ever; and the house of Israel shall no 
more defile My holy name, neither 
they, nor their kings, by their harlotry, 
and by the carcasses of their kings in 
their high places; 8in their setting of 
their threshold by My threshold, and 
their door-post beside My door-post, 
and there was but the wall between Me 
and them; and they have defiled My 
holy name by their abominations 
which they have committed; wherefore 
I have consumed them in Mine anger. 
9Now let them put away their harlotry, 
and the carcasses of their kings, far 
from Me, and I will dwell in the midst 
of them for ever. 

10Thou, son of man, show the house 
to the house of Israel, that they may be 
ashamed of their iniquities; and let 
them measure accurately. 11And if they 
be ashamed of all that they have done, 
make known unto them the form of the 
house, and the fashion thereof, and the 
goings out thereof, and the comings in 
thereof, and all the forms thereof, and 
all the ordinances thereof, and all the 
forms thereof, and all the laws thereof, 
and write it in their sight; that they 
43 




may keep the whole form thereof, and 
all the ordinances thereof, and do 
them. 

12This is the law of the house: upon 
the top of the mountain the whole limit 
thereof round about shall be most holy. 
Behold, this is the law of the house. 

13And these are the measures of the 
altar by cubits—the cubit is a cubit and 
a handbreadth: the bottom shall be a 
cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the 
border thereof by the edge thereof 
round about a span; and this shall be 
the base of the altar. 14And from the 
bottom upon the ground to the lower 
settle shall be two cubits, and the 
breadth one cubit; and from the lesser 
settle to the greater settle shall be four 
cubits, and the breadth a cubit. 15And 
the hearth shall be four cubits; and 
from the hearth and upward there shall 
be four horns. 16And the hearth shall 
be twelve cubits long by twelve broad, 
square in the four sides thereof. 17And 
the settle shall be fourteen cubits long 
by fourteen broad in the four sides 
thereof; and the border about it shall 
be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof 
shall be a cubit about; and the steps 
thereof shall look toward the east.’ 

18And He said unto me: ‘Son of 
man, thus saith the Lord GOD: These 
are the ordinances of the altar in the 
day when they shall make it, to offer 
burnt-offerings thereon, and to dash 
blood against it. 19Thou shalt give to 
the priests the Levites that are of the 
seed of Zadok, who are near unto Me, 
to minister unto Me, saith the Lord 
GOD, a young bullock for a sin-
offering. 20And thou shalt take of the 
blood thereof, and put it on the four 
horns of it, and on the four corners of 
the settle, and upon the border round 
about; thus shalt thou purify it and 
make atonement for it. 21Thou shalt 
also take the bullock of the sin-
offering, and it shall be burnt in the 
appointed place of the house, without 
the sanctuary. 22And on the second day 
thou shalt offer a he-goat without 
blemish for a sin-offering; and they 
shall purify the altar, as they did purify 
it with the bullock. 23When thou hast 
made an end of purifying it, thou shalt 
offer a young bullock without blemish, 
and a ram out of the flock without 
blemish. 24And thou shalt present them 
before the LORD, and the priests shall 
cast salt upon them, and they shall 
offer them up for a burnt-offering unto 
the LORD. 25Seven days shalt thou 
prepare every day a goat for a sin-
offering; they shall also prepare a 
young bullock, and a ram out of the 
flock, without blemish. 26Seven days 
shall they make atonement for the altar 
and cleanse it; so shall they consecrate 
it. 27And when they have accomplished 
the days, it shall be that upon the 
eighth day, and forward, the priests 
shall make your burnt-offerings upon 
the altar, and your peace-offerings; 
and I will accept you, saith the Lord 
GOD.’ 

Then he brought me back the 
way of the outer gate of the 
sanctuary, which looketh toward the 
44 




east; and it was shut. 2And the LORD 
said unto me: ‘This gate shall be shut, 
it shall not be opened, neither shall any 
man enter in by it, for the LORD, the 
God of Israel, hath entered in by it; 
therefore it shall be shut. 3As for the 
prince, being a prince, he shall sit 
therein to eat bread before the LORD; 
he shall enter by the way of the porch 
of the gate, and shall go out by the 
way of the same.’ 

4Then he brought me the way of the 
north gate before the house; and I 
looked, and, behold, the glory of the 
LORD filled the house of the LORD; and 
I fell upon my face. 5And the LORD 
said unto me: ‘Son of man, mark well, 
and behold with thine eyes, and hear 
with thine ears all that I say unto thee 
concerning all the ordinances of the 
house of the LORD, and all the laws 
thereof; and mark well the entering in 
of the house, with every going forth of 
the sanctuary. 6And thou shalt say to 
the rebellious, even to the house of 
Israel: Thus saith the Lord GOD: O ye 
house of Israel, let it suffice you of all 
your abominations, 7in that ye have 
brought in aliens, uncircumcised in 
heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be 
in My sanctuary, to profane it, even 
My house, when ye offer My bread, 
the fat and the blood, and they have 
broken My covenant, to add unto all 
your abominations. 8And ye have not 
kept the charge of My holy things; but 
ye have set keepers of My charge in 
My sanctuary to please yourselves. 

9Thus saith the Lord GOD: No alien, 
uncircumcised in heart and 
uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into 
My sanctuary, even any alien that is 
among the children of Israel. 10But the 
Levites, that went far from Me, when 
Israel went astray, that went astray 
from Me after their idols, they shall 
bear their iniquity; 11and they shall be 
ministers in My sanctuary, having 
charge at the gates of the house, and 
ministering in the house: they shall 
slay the burnt-offering and the 
sacrifice for the people, and they shall 
stand before them to minister unto 
them. 12Because they ministered unto 
them before their idols, and became a 
stumblingblock of iniquity unto the 
house of Israel; therefore have I lifted 
up My hand against them, saith the 
Lord GOD, and they shall bear their 
iniquity. 13And they shall not come 
near unto Me, to minister unto Me in 
the priest’s office, nor to come near to 
any of My holy things, unto the things 
that are most holy; but they shall bear 
their shame, and their abominations 
which they have committed. 14And I 
will make them keepers of the charge 
of the house, for all the service thereof, 
and for all that shall be done therein. 

15But the priests the Levites, the 
sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of 
My sanctuary when the children of 
Israel went astray from Me, they shall 
come near to Me to minister unto Me; 
and they shall stand before Me to offer 
unto Me the fat and the blood, saith the 
Lord GOD; 16they shall enter into My 


sanctuary, and they shall come near to 
My table, to minister unto Me, and 
they shall keep My charge. 17And it 
shall be that when they enter in at the 
gates of the inner court, they shall be 
clothed with linen garments; and no 
wool shall come upon them, while 
they minister in the gates of the inner 
court, and within. 18They shall have 
linen tires upon their heads, and shall 
have linen breeches upon their loins; 
they shall not gird themselves with any 
thing that causeth sweat. 19And when 
they go forth into the outer court, even 
into the outer court to the people, they 
shall put off their garments wherein 
they minister, and lay them in the holy 
chambers, and they shall put on other 
garments, that they sanctify not the 
people with their garments. 20Neither 
shall they shave their heads, nor suffer 
their locks to grow long; they shall 
only poll their heads. 21Neither shall 
any priest drink wine, when they enter 
into the inner court. 22Neither shall 
they take for their wives a widow, nor 
her that is put away; but they shall take 
virgins of the seed of the house of 
Israel, or a widow that is the widow of 
a priest. 23And they shall teach My 
people the difference between the holy 
and the common, and cause them to 
discern between the unclean and the 
clean. 24And in a controversy they 
shall stand to judge; according to Mine 
ordinances shall they judge it; and they 
shall keep My laws and My statutes in 
all My appointed seasons, and they 
shall hallow My sabbaths. 25And they 
shall come near no dead person to 
defile themselves; but for father, or for 
mother, or for son, or for daughter, for 
brother, or for sister that hath had no 
husband, they may defile themselves. 
26And after he is cleansed, they shall 
reckon unto him seven days. 27And in 
the day that he goeth into the 
sanctuary, into the inner court, to 
minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer 
his sin-offering, saith the Lord GOD. 
28And it shall be unto them for an 
inheritance: I am their inheritance; and 
ye shall give them no possession in 
Israel: I am their possession. 29The 
meal-offering, and the sin-offering, 
and the guilt-offering, they, even they, 
shall eat; and every devoted thing in 
Israel shall be theirs. 30And the first of 
all the first-fruits of every thing, and 
every heave-offering of every thing, of 
all your offerings, shall be for the 
priests; ye shall also give unto the 
priest the first of your dough, to cause 
a blessing to rest on thy house. 31The 
priests shall not eat of any thing that 
dieth of itself, or is torn, whether it be 
fowl or beast. 

Moreover, when ye shall 
divide by lot the land for 
inheritance, ye shall set apart an 
offering unto the LORD, a holy portion 
of the land; the length shall be the 
length of five and twenty thousand 
reeds, and the breadth shall be ten 
thousand; it shall be holy in all the 
border thereof round about. 2Of this 
there shall be for the holy place five 
hundred in length by five hundred in 
45 




breadth, square round about; and fifty 
cubits for the open land round about it. 
3And of this measure shalt thou 
measure a length of five and twenty 
thousand, and a breadth of ten 
thousand; and in it shall be the 
sanctuary, which is most holy. 4It is a 
holy portion of the land; it shall be for 
the priests, the ministers of the 
sanctuary, that come near to minister 
unto the LORD; and it shall be a place 
for their houses, and a place 
consecrated for the sanctuary. 5And 
five and twenty thousand in length, 
and ten thousand in breadth, which 
shall be unto the Levites, the ministers 
of the house, for a possession unto 
themselves, for twenty chambers. 6And 
ye shall appoint the possession of the 
city five thousand broad, and five and 
twenty thousand long, side by side 
with the offering of the holy portion; it 
shall be for the whole house of Israel. 
7And for the prince, on the one side 
and on the other side of the holy 
offering and of the possession of the 
city, in front of the holy offering and 
in front of the possession of the city, 
on the west side westward, and on the 
east side eastward; and in length 
answerable unto one of the portions, 
from the west border unto the east 
border 8of the land; it shall be to him 
for a possession in Israel, and My 
princes shall no more wrong My 
people; but they shall give the land to 
the house of Israel according to their 
tribes. 

9Thus saith the Lord GOD: Let it 
suffice you, O princes of Israel; 
remove violence and spoil, and 
execute justice and righteousness; take 
away your exactions from My people, 
saith the Lord GOD. 

10Ye shall have just balances, and a 
just ephah, and a just bath. 11The 
ephah and the bath shall be of one 
measure, that the bath may contain the 
tenth part of a homer, and the ephah 
the tenth part of a homer; the measure 
thereof shall be after the homer. 12And 
the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; 
twenty shekels, five and twenty 
shekels, ten, and five shekels, shall be 
your maneh. 

13This is the offering that ye shall set 
apart: the sixth part of an ephah out of 
a homer of wheat, and ye shall give the 
sixth part of an ephah out of a homer 
of barley; 14and the set portion of oil, 
the bath of oil, shall be the tithe of the 
bath out of the cor, which is ten baths, 
even a homer; for ten baths are a 
homer; 15and one lamb of the flock, 
out of two hundred, from the well-
watered pastures of Israel; for a meal-
offering, and for a burnt-offering, and 
for peace-offerings, to make 
atonement for them, saith the Lord 
GOD. 

16All the people of the land shall 
give this offering for the prince in 
Israel. 17And it shall be the prince’s 
part to give the burnt-offerings, and 
the meal-offerings, and the drink-
offerings, in the feasts, and in the new 
moons, and in the sabbaths, in all the 


appointed seasons of the house of 
Israel; he shall prepare the sin-
offering, and the meal-offering, and 
the burnt-offering, and the peace-
offerings, to make atonement for the 
house of Israel. 

18Thus saith the Lord GOD: In the 
first month, in the first day of the 
month, thou shalt take a young bullock 
without blemish; and thou shalt purify 
the sanctuary. 19And the priest shall 
take of the blood of the sin-offering, 
and put it upon the door-posts of the 
house, and upon the four corners of the 
settle of the altar, and upon the posts 
of the gate of the inner court. 20And so 
thou shalt do on the seventh day of the 
month for every one that erreth, and 
for him that is simple; so shall ye 
make atonement for the house. 21In the 
first month, in the fourteenth day of 
the month, ye shall have the passover; 
a feast of seven days; unleavened 
bread shall be eaten. 22And upon that 
day shall the prince prepare for 
himself and for all the people of the 
land a bullock for a sin-offering. 23And 
the seven days of the feast he shall 
prepare a burnt-offering to the LORD, 
seven bullocks and seven rams without 
blemish daily the seven days; and a he-
goat daily for a sin-offering. 24And he 
shall prepare a meal-offering, an ephah 
for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, 
and a hin of oil to an ephah. 25In the 
seventh month, in the fifteenth day of 
the month, in the feast, shall he do the 
like the seven days; to the sin-offering 
as well as the burnt-offering, and the 
meal-offering as well as the oil. 

Thus saith the Lord GOD: The 
gate of the inner court that 
looketh toward the east shall be shut 
the six working days; but on the 
sabbath day it shall be opened, and in 
the day of the new moon it shall be 
opened. 2And the prince shall enter by 
the way of the porch of the gate 
without, and shall stand by the post of 
the gate, and the priests shall prepare 
his burnt-offering and his peace-
offerings, and he shall worship at the 
threshold of the gate; then he shall go 
forth; but the gate shall not be shut 
until the evening. 3Likewise the people 
of the land shall worship at the door of 
that gate before the LORD in the 
sabbaths and in the new moons. 4And 
the burnt-offering that the prince shall 
offer unto the LORD shall be in the 
sabbath day six lambs without blemish 
and a ram without blemish; 5and the 
meal-offering shall be an ephah for the 
ram, and the meal-offering for the 
lambs as he is able to give, and a hin 
of oil to an ephah. 6And in the day of 
the new moon it shall be a young 
bullock without blemish; and six 
lambs, and a ram; they shall be 
without blemish; 7and he shall prepare 
a meal-offering, an ephah for the 
bullock, and an ephah for the ram, and 
for the lambs according as his means 
suffice, and a hin of oil to an ephah. 
8And when the prince shall enter, he 
shall go in by the way of the porch of 
the gate, and he shall go forth by the 
46 




way thereof. 9But when the people of 
the land shall come before the LORD in 
the appointed seasons, he that entereth 
by the way of the north gate to 
worship shall go forth by the way of 
the south gate; and he that entereth by 
the way of the south gate shall go forth 
by the way of the north gate; he shall 
not return by the way of the gate 
whereby he came in, but shall go forth 
straight before him. 10And the prince, 
when they go in, shall go in in the 
midst of them; and when they go forth, 
they shall go forth together. 11And in 
the feasts and in the appointed seasons 
the meal-offering shall be an ephah for 
a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and 
for the lambs as he is able to give, and 
a hin of oil to an ephah. 

12And when the prince shall prepare 
a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or 
peace-offerings as a freewill-offering 
unto the LORD, one shall open for him 
the gate that looketh toward the east, 
and he shall prepare his burnt-offering 
and his peace-offerings, as he doth on 
the sabbath day; then he shall go forth; 
and after his going forth one shall shut 
the gate. 

13And thou shalt prepare a lamb of 
the first year without blemish for a 
burnt-offering unto the LORD daily; 
morning by morning shalt thou prepare 
it. 14And thou shalt prepare a meal-
offering with it morning by morning, 
the sixth part of an ephah, and the third 
part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine 
flour: a meal-offering unto the LORD 
continually by a perpetual ordinance. 
15Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and 
the meal-offering, and the oil, morning 
by morning, for a continual burnt-
offering. 

16Thus saith the Lord GOD: If the 
prince give a gift unto any of his sons, 
it is his inheritance, it shall belong to 
his sons; it is their possession by 
inheritance. 17But if he give of his 
inheritance a gift to one of his 
servants, it shall be his to the year of 
liberty; then it shall return to the 
prince; but as for his inheritance, it 
shall be for his sons. 18Moreover the 
prince shall not take of the people’s 
inheritance, to thrust them wrongfully 
out of their possession; he shall give 
inheritance to his sons out of his own 
possession; that My people be not 
scattered every man from his 
possession.’ 

19Then he brought me through the 
entry, which was at the side of the 
gate, into the holy chambers for the 
priests, which looked toward the north; 
and, behold, there was a place on the 
hinder part westward. 20And he said 
unto me: ‘This is the place where the 
priests shall boil the guilt-offering and 
the sin-offering, where they shall bake 
the meal-offering; that they bring them 
not forth into the outer court, to 
sanctify the people.’ 

21Then he brought me forth into the 
outer court, and caused me to pass by 
the four corners of the court; and, 
behold, in every corner of the court 
there was a court. 22In the four corners 
of the court there were courts inclosed, 


forty cubits long and thirty broad; 
these four in the corners were of one 
measure. 23And there was a row of 
masonry round about in them, round 
about the four, and it was made with 
boiling-places under the rows round 
about. 24Then said he unto me: ‘These 
are the boiling-places, where the 
ministers of the house shall boil the 
sacrifices of the people.’ 

And he brought me back unto 
the door of the house; and, 
behold, waters issued out from under 
the threshold of the house eastward, 
for the forefront of the house looked 
toward the east; and the waters came 
down from under, from the right side 
of the house, on the south of the altar. 
2Then brought he me out by the way of 
the gate northward, and led me round 
by the way without unto the outer gate, 
by the way of the gate that looketh 
toward the east; and, behold, there 
trickled forth waters on the right side. 

3When the man went forth eastward 
with the line in his hand, he measured 
a thousand cubits, and he caused me to 
pass through the waters, waters that 
were to the ankles. 4Again he 
measured a thousand, and caused me 
to pass through the waters, waters that 
were to the knees. Again he measured 
a thousand, and caused me to pass 
through waters that were to the loins. 
5Afterward he measured a thousand; 
and it was a river that I could not pass 
through; for the waters were risen, 
waters to swim in, a river that could 
not be passed through. 6And he said 
unto me: ‘Hast thou seen this, O son of 
man?’ Then he led me, and caused me 
to return to the bank of the river. 

7Now when I had been brought 
back, behold, upon the bank of the 
river were very many trees on the one 
side and on the other. 8Then said he 
unto me: ‘These waters issue forth 
toward the eastern region, and shall go 
down into the Arabah; and when they 
shall enter into the sea, into the sea of 
the putrid waters, the waters shall be 
healed. 9And it shall come to pass, that 
every living creature wherewith it 
swarmeth, whithersoever the rivers 
shall come, shall live; and there shall 
be a very great multitude of fish; for 
these waters are come thither, that all 
things be healed and may live 
whithersoever the river cometh. 10And 
it shall come to pass, that fishers shall 
stand by it from En-gedi even unto En-
eglaim; there shall be a place for the 
spreading of nets; their fish shall be 
after their kinds, as the fish of the 
Great Sea, exceeding many. 11But the 
miry places thereof, and the marshes 
thereof, shall not be healed; they shall 
be given for salt. 12And by the river 
upon the bank thereof, on this side and 
on that side, shall grow every tree for 
food, whose leaf shall not wither, 
neither shall the fruit thereof fail; it 
shall bring forth new fruit every 
month, because the waters thereof 
issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit 
thereof shall be for food, and the leaf 
thereof for healing.’ 
47 




13Thus saith the Lord GOD: ‘This 
shall be the border, whereby ye shall 
divide the land for inheritance 
according to the twelve tribes of Israel, 
Joseph receiving two portions. 14And 
ye shall inherit it, one as well as 
another, concerning which I lifted up 
My hand to give it unto your fathers; 
and this land shall fall unto you for 
inheritance. 15And this shall be the 
border of the land: on the north side, 
from the Great Sea, by the way of 
Hethlon, unto the entrance of Zedad; 
16Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is 
between the border of Damascus and 
the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, 
which is by the border of Hauran. 
17And the border from the sea shall be 
Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus, 
and on the north northward is the 
border of Hamath. This is the north 
side. 18And the east side, between 
Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and 
the land of Israel, by the Jordan, from 
the border unto the east sea shall ye 
measure. This is the east side. 19And 
the south side southward shall be from 
Tamar as far as the waters of 
Meriboth-kadesh, to the Brook, unto 
the Great Sea. This is the south side 
southward. 20And the west side shall 
be the Great Sea, from the border as 
far as over against the entrance of 
Hamath. This is the west side. 

21So shall ye divide this land unto 
you according to the tribes of Israel. 
22And it shall come to pass, that ye 
shall divide it by lot for an inheritance 
unto you and to the strangers that 
sojourn among you, who shall beget 
children among you; and they shall be 
unto you as the home-born among the 
children of Israel; they shall have 
inheritance with you among the tribes 
of Israel. 23And it shall come to pass, 
that in what tribe the stranger 
sojourneth, there shall ye give him his 
inheritance, saith the Lord GOD. 

Now these are the names of 
the tribes: from the north end, 
beside the way of Hethlon to the 
entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan, at the 
border of Damascus, northward, 
beside Hamath; and they shall have 
their sides east and west: Dan, one 
portion. 2And by the border of Dan, 
from the east side unto the west side: 
Asher, one portion. 3And by the border 
of Asher, from the east side even unto 
the west side: Naphtali, one portion. 
4And by the border of Naphtali, from 
the east side unto the west side: 
Manasseh, one portion. 5And by the 
border of Manasseh, from the east side 
unto the west side: Ephraim, one 
portion. 6And by the border of 
Ephraim, from the east side even unto 
the west side: Reuben, one portion. 
7And by the border of Reuben, from 
the east side unto the west side: Judah, 
one portion. 

8And by the border of Judah, from 
the east side unto the west side, shall 
be the offering which ye shall set 
aside, five and twenty thousand reeds 
in breadth, and in length as one of the 
portions, from the east side unto the 
west side; and the sanctuary shall be in 
48 




the midst of it. 9The offering that ye 
shall set apart unto the LORD shall be 
five and twenty thousand reeds in 
length, and ten thousand in breadth. 
10And for these, even for the priests, 
shall be the holy offering; toward the 
north five and twenty thousand [in 
length], and toward the west ten 
thousand in breadth, and toward the 
east ten thousand in breadth, and 
toward the south five and twenty 
thousand in length; and the sanctuary 
of the LORD shall be in the midst 
thereof. 11The sanctified portion shall 
be for the priests of the sons of Zadok, 
that have kept My charge, that went 
not astray when the children of Israel 
went astray, as the Levites went astray. 
12And it shall be unto them a portion 
set apart from the offering of the land, 
a thing most holy, by the border of the 
Levites. 13And answerable unto the 
border of the priests, the Levites shall 
have five and twenty thousand in 
length, and ten thousand in breadth; all 
the length shall be five and twenty 
thousand, and the breadth ten 
thousand. 14And they shall not sell of 
it, nor exchange, nor alienate the first 
portion of the land; for it is holy unto 
the LORD. 

15And the five thousand that are left 
in the breadth, in front of the five and 
twenty thousand, shall be for common 
use, for the city, for dwelling and for 
open land; and the city shall be in the 
midst thereof. 16And these shall be the 
measures thereof: the north side four 
thousand and five hundred, and the 
south side four thousand and five 
hundred, and on the east side four 
thousand and five hundred, and the 
west side four thousand and five 
hundred. 17And the city shall have 
open land: toward the north two 
hundred and fifty, and toward the 
south two hundred and fifty, and 
toward the east two hundred and fifty, 
and toward the west two hundred and 
fifty. 18And the residue in the length, 
answerable unto the holy offering, 
shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten 
thousand westward; and it shall be 
answerable unto the holy offering; and 
the increase thereof shall be for food 
unto them that serve the city. 19And 
they that serve the city, out of all the 
tribes of Israel, shall till it. 20All the 
offering shall be five and twenty 
thousand by five and twenty thousand; 
ye shall set apart the holy offering 
foursquare, with the possession of the 
city. 

21And the residue shall be for the 
prince, on the one side and on the 
other of the holy offering and of the 
possession of the city, in front of the 
five and twenty thousand of the 
offering toward the east border, and 
westward in front of the five and 
twenty thousand toward the west 
border, answerable unto the portions, it 
shall be for the prince; and the holy 
offering and the sanctuary of the house 
shall be in the midst thereof. 22Thus 
the possession of the Levites, and the 
possession of the city, shall be in the 
midst of that which is the prince’s; 


between the border of Judah and the 
border of Benjamin shall be the 
prince’s. 

23And as for the rest of the tribes: 
from the east side unto the west side: 
Benjamin, one portion. 24And by the 
border of Benjamin, from the east side 
unto the west side: Simeon, one 
portion. 25And by the border of 
Simeon, from the east side unto the 
west side: Issachar, one portion. 26And 
by the border of Issachar, from the east 
side unto the west side: Zebulun, one 
portion. 27And by the border of 
Zebulun, from the east side unto the 
west side: Gad, one portion. 28And by 
the border of Gad, at the south side 
southward, the border shall be even 
from Tamar unto the waters of 
Meribath-kadesh, to the Brook, unto 
the Great Sea. 29This is the land which 
ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of 
Israel for inheritance, and these are 
their portions, saith the Lord GOD. 

30And these are the goings out of the 
city: on the north side four thousand 
and five hundred reeds by measure; 
31and the gates of the city shall be after 
the names of the tribes of Israel; three 
gates northward: the gate of Reuben, 
one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of 
Levi, one; 32and at the east side four 
thousand and five hundred reeds; and 
three gates: even the gate of Joseph, 
one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the 
gate of Dan, one; 33and at the south 
side four thousand and five hundred 
reeds by measure; and three gates: the 
gate of Simeon, one; the gate of 
Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, 
one; 34at the west side four thousand 
and five hundred reeds, with their 
three gates: the gate of Gad, one; the 
gate of Asher, one; the gate of 
Naphtali, one. 35It shall be eighteen 
thousand reeds round about. And the 
name of the city from that day shall be, 
The LORD is there.’
