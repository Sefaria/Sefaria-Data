MALACHI 

 

The burden of the word of the 
LORD to Israel by Malachi. 

 

2I have loved you, saith the LORD. 

Yet ye say: ‘Wherein hast Thou 
loved us?’ 

Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? 

Saith the LORD; 

Yet I loved Jacob; 

3But Esau I hated, 

And made his mountains a 
desolation, 

And gave his heritage to the jackals 
of the wilderness. 

4Whereas Edom saith: 

‘We are beaten down, 

But we will return and build the 
waste places’; 

Thus saith the LORD of hosts: 

They shall build, but I will throw 
down; 

And they shall be called The border 
of wickedness, 

And The people whom the LORD 
execrateth for ever. 

5And your eyes shall see, 

And ye shall say: 

‘The LORD is great beyond the 
border of Israel.’ 

 

6A son honoureth his father, 

And a servant his master; 

If then I be a father, 

Where is My honour? 

And if I be a master, 

Where is My fear? 

Saith the LORD of hosts 

Unto you, O priests, that despise My 
name. 

And ye say: ‘Wherein have we 
despised Thy name?’ 

7Ye offer polluted bread upon Mine 
altar. 

And ye say: ‘Wherein have we 
polluted thee?’ 

In that ye say: ‘The table of the 
LORD is contemptible.’ 

8And when ye offer the blind for 
sacrifice, is it no evil! 

And when ye offer the lame and 
sick, is it no evil! 

Present it now unto thy governor; 
will he be pleased with thee? 

Or will he accept thy person? 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

9And now, I pray you, entreat the 
favour of God 

That He may be gracious unto us!— 

This hath been of your doing.— 

Will He accept any of your persons? 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

10Oh that there were even one 
among you that would shut the 
doors, 
1 




That ye might not kindle fire on 
Mine altar in vain! 

I have no pleasure in you, 

Saith the LORD of hosts, 

Neither will I accept an offering at 
your hand. 

11For from the rising of the sun even 
unto the going down of the same 

My name is great among the 
nations; 

And in every place offerings are 
presented unto My name, 

Even pure oblations; 

For My name is great among the 
nations, 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

12But ye profane it, 

In that ye say: 

‘The table of the LORD is polluted, 

And the fruit thereof, even the food 
thereof, is contemptible.’ 

13Ye say also: 

‘Behold, what a weariness is it!’ 

And ye have snuffed at it, 

Saith the LORD of hosts; 

And ye have brought that which was 
taken by violence, 

And the lame, and the sick; 

Thus ye bring the offering; 

Should I accept this of your hand? 

Saith the LORD. 

14But cursed be he that dealeth 
craftily, 

Whereas he hath in his flock a male, 

And voweth, and sacrificeth unto 
the Lord a blemished thing; 

For I am a great King, 

Saith the LORD of hosts, 

And My name is feared among the 
nations. 

 

And now, this commandment 

Is for you, O ye priests. 

2If ye will not hearken, and if ye 
will not lay it to heart, 

To give glory unto My name, 

Saith the LORD of hosts, 

Then will I send the curse upon you, 

And I will curse your blessings; 

Yea, I curse them, 

Because ye do not lay it to heart. 

3Behold, I will rebuke the seed for 
your hurt, 

And will spread dung upon your 
faces, 

Even the dung of your sacrifices; 

And ye shall be taken away unto it. 

4Know then that I have sent 

This commandment unto you, 

That My covenant might be with 
Levi, 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

5My covenant was with him 

Of life and peace, and I gave them 
to him, 

And of fear, and he feared Me, 

And was afraid of My name. 

6The law of truth was in his mouth, 

And unrighteousness was not found 
in his lips; 

He walked with Me in peace and 
uprightness, 

And did turn many away from 
iniquity. 

7For the priest’s lips should keep 
knowledge, 
2 




And they should seek the law at his 
mouth; 

For he is the messenger of the LORD 
of hosts. 

8But ye are turned aside out of the 
way; 

Ye have caused many to stumble in 
the law; 

Ye have corrupted the covenant of 
Levi, 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

9Therefore have I also made you 

Contemptible and base before all the 
people, 

According as ye have not kept My 
ways, 

But have had respect of persons in 
the law. 

 

10Have we not all one father? 

Hath not one God created us? 

Why do we deal treacherously every 
man against his brother, 

Profaning the covenant of our 
fathers? 

11Judah hath dealt treacherously, 

And an abomination is committed in 
Israel and in Jerusalem; 

For Judah hath profaned the 
holiness of the LORD which He 
loveth, 

And hath married the daughter of a 
strange god. 

12May the LORD cut off to the man 
that doeth this, 

Him that calleth and him that 
answereth out of the tents of 
Jacob, 

And him that offereth an offering 
unto the LORD of hosts. 

13And this further ye do: 

Ye cover the altar of the LORD with 
tears, 

With weeping, and with sighing, 

Insomuch that He regardeth not the 
offering any more, 

Neither receiveth it with good will 
at your hand. 

14Yet ye say: ‘Wherefore?’ 

Because the LORD hath been witness 

Between thee and the wife of thy 
youth, 

Against whom thou hast dealt 
treacherously, 

Though she is thy companion, 

And the wife of thy covenant. 

15And not one hath done so 

Who had exuberance of spirit! 

For what seeketh the one? 

A seed given of God. 

Therefore take heed to your spirit, 

And let none deal treacherously 
against the wife of his youth. 

16For I hate putting away, 

Saith the LORD, the God of Israel, 

And him that covereth his garment 
with violence, 

Saith the LORD of hosts; 

Therefore take heed to your spirit, 

That ye deal not treacherously. 

 

17Ye have wearied the LORD with 
your words. 

Yet ye say: ‘Wherein have we 
wearied Him?’ 

In that ye say: ‘Every one that doeth 
evil 


Is good in the sight of the LORD, 

And He delighteth in them; 

Or where is the God of justice?’ 

 

Behold, I send My messenger, 
And he shall clear the way before 
Me; 

And the Lord, whom ye seek, 

Will suddenly come to His temple, 

And the messenger of the covenant, 

Whom ye delight in, 

Behold, he cometh, 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

2But who may abide the day of his 
coming? 

And who shall stand when he 
appeareth? 

For he is like a refiner’s fire, 

And like fullers’soap; 

3And he shall sit as a refiner and 
purifier of silver; 

And he shall purify the sons of Levi, 

And purge them as gold and silver; 

And there shall be they that shall 
offer unto the LORD 

Offerings in righteousness. 

4Then shall the offering of Judah 
and Jerusalem 

Be pleasant unto the LORD, 

As in the days of old, 

And as in ancient years. 

 

5And I will come near to you to 
judgment; 

And I will be a swift witness 

Against the sorcerers, and against 
the adulterers, 

And against false swearers; 

And against those that oppress the 
hireling in his wages, 

The widow, and the fatherless, 

And that turn aside the stranger 
from his right, 

And fear not Me, 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

6For I the LORD change not; 

And ye, O sons of Jacob, are not 
consumed. 

 

7From the days of your fathers ye 
have turned aside 

From Mine ordinances, and have not 
kept them. 

Return unto Me, and I will return 
unto you, 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

But ye say: ‘Wherein shall we 
return?’ 

8Will a man rob God? 

Yet ye rob Me. 

But ye say: ‘Wherein have we 
robbed Thee?’ 

In tithes and heave-offerings. 

9Ye are cursed with the curse, 

Yet ye rob Me, 

Even this whole nation. 

10Bring ye the whole tithe into the 
store-house, 

That there may be food in My 
house, 

And try Me now herewith, 

Saith the LORD of hosts, 

If I will not open you the windows 
of heaven, 

And pour you out a blessing, 

That there shall be more than 
sufficiency. 
3 




11And I will rebuke the devourer for 
your good, 

And he shall not destroy the fruits of 
your land; 

Neither shall your vine cast its fruit 
before the time in the field, 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

12And all nations shall call you 
happy; 

For ye shall be a delightsome land, 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

 

13Your words have been all too 
strong against Me, 

Saith the LORD. 

Yet ye say: ‘Wherein have we 
spoken against thee?’ 

14Ye have said: ‘It is vain to serve 
God; 

And what profit is it that we have 
kept His charge, 

And that we have walked 
mournfully 

Because of the LORD of hosts? 

15And now we call the proud happy; 

Yea, they that work wickedness are 
built up; 

Yea, they try God, and are 
delivered.’ 

16Then they that feared the LORD 

Spoke one with another; 

And the LORD hearkened, and heard, 

And a book of remembrance was 
written before Him, 

For them that feared the LORD, and 
that thought upon His name. 

17And they shall be Mine, saith the 
LORD of hosts, 

In the day that I do make, even 
Mine own treasure; 

And I will spare them, as a man 
spareth 

His own son that serveth him. 

18Then shall ye again discern 
between the righteous and the 
wicked, 

Between him that serveth God 

And him that serveth Him not. 

19For, behold, the day cometh, 

It burneth as a furnace; 

And all the proud, and all that work 
wickedness, shall be stubble; 

And the day that cometh shall set 
them ablaze, 

Saith the LORD of hosts, 

That it shall leave them neither root 
nor branch. 

20But unto you that fear My name 

Shall the sun of righteousness arise 
with healing in its wings; 

And ye shall go forth, and gambol 

As calves of the stall. 

21And ye shall tread down the 
wicked; 

For they shall be ashes under the 
soles of your feet 

In the day that I do make, 

Saith the LORD of hosts. 

 

22Remember ye the law of Moses 
My servant, 

Which I commanded unto him in 
Horeb for all Israel, 

Even statutes and ordinances. 

23Behold, I will send you 

Elijah the prophet 

Before the coming 


Of the great and terrible day of the 
LORD. 

24And he shall turn the heart of the 
fathers to the children, 

And the heart of the children to their 
fathers; 

Lest I come and smite the land with 
utter destruction. 

 

Behold, I will send you 

Elijah the prophet 

Before the coming 

Of the great and terrible day of the LORD.
