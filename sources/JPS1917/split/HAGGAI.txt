HAGGAI 

 

In the second year of Darius the 
king, in the sixth month, in the 
first day of the month, came the word 
of the LORD by Haggai the prophet 
unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, 
governor of Judah, and to Joshua the 
son of Jehozadak, the high priest, 
saying: 2’Thus speaketh the LORD of 
hosts, saying: This people say: The 
time is not come, the time that the 
LORD’S house should be built.’ 3Then 
came the word of the LORD by Haggai 
the prophet, saying: 4’Is it a time for 
you yourselves to dwell in your cieled 
houses, while this house lieth waste? 
5Now therefore thus saith the LORD of 
hosts: 

Consider your ways. 

6Ye have sown much, and brought 
in little, 

Ye eat, but ye have not enough, 

Ye drink, but ye are not filled with 
drink, 

Ye clothe you, but there is none 
warm; 

And he that earneth wages earneth 
wages 

For a bag with holes. 

7Thus saith the LORD of hosts: 
Consider your ways. 8Go up to the hill-
country, and bring wood, and build the 
house; and I will take pleasure in it, 
and I will be glorified, saith the LORD. 
9Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came 
to little; and when ye brought it home, 
I did blow upon it. Why? saith the 
LORD of hosts. Because of My house 
that lieth waste, while ye run every 
man for his own house. 10Therefore 
over you the heaven hath kept back, so 
that there is no dew, and the earth hath 
kept back her produce. 11And I called 
for a drought upon the land, and upon 
the mountains, and upon the corn, and 
upon the wine, and upon the oil, and 
upon that which the ground bringeth 
forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, 
and upon all the labour of the hands.’ 

12Then Zerubbabel the son of 
Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of 
Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the 
remnant of the people, hearkened unto 
the voice of the LORD their God, and 
unto the words of Haggai the prophet, 
as the LORD their God had sent him; 
and the people did fear before the 
LORD. 13Then spoke Haggai the LORD’S 
messenger in the LORD’S message unto 
the people, saying: ‘I am with you, 
saith the LORD.’ 14And the LORD stirred 
up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of 
Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the 
spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, 
the high priest, and the spirit of all the 
remnant of the people; and they came 
and did work in the house of the LORD 
of hosts, their God, 15in the four and 
twentieth day of the month, in the 
1 




sixth month, in the second year of 
Darius the king. 

In the seventh month, in the one 
and twentieth day of the month, 
came the word of the LORD by Haggai 
the prophet, saying: 2’Speak now to 
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, 
governor of Judah, and to Joshua the 
son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and 
to the remnant of the people, saying: 
3Who is left among you that saw this 
house in its former glory? and how do 
ye see it now? is not such a one as 
nothing in your eyes? 4Yet now be 
strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; 
and be strong, O Joshua, son of 
Jehozadak, the high priest; and be 
strong, all ye people of the land, saith 
the LORD, and work; for I am with you, 
saith the LORD of hosts. 5The word that 
I covenanted with you when ye came 
out of Egypt have I established, and 
My spirit abideth among you; fear ye 
not. 6For thus saith the LORD of hosts: 
Yet once, it is a little while, and I will 
shake the heavens, and the earth, and 
the sea, and the dry land; 7and I will 
shake all nations, and the choicest 
things of all nations shall come, and I 
will fill this house with glory, saith the 
LORD of hosts. 8Mine is the silver, and 
Mine the gold, saith the LORD of hosts. 
9The glory of this latter house shall be 
greater than that of the former, saith 
the LORD of hosts; and in this place 
will I give peace, saith the LORD of 
hosts.’ 

10In the four and twentieth day of 
the ninth month, in the second year of 
Darius, came the word of the LORD by 
Haggai the prophet, saying: 11’Thus 
saith the LORD of hosts: Ask now the 
priests for instruction, saying: 12If one 
bear hallowed flesh in the skirt of his 
garment, and with his skirt do touch 
bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or 
any food, shall it be holy?’ And the 
priests answered and said: ‘No.’ 
13Then said Haggai: ‘If one that is 
unclean by a dead body touch any of 
these, shall it be unclean?’ And the 
priests answered and said: ‘It shall be 
unclean.’ 14Then answered Haggai, 
and said: ‘So is this people, and so is 
this nation before me, saith the LORD; 
and so is every work of their hands; 
and that which they offer there is 
unclean. 15And now, I pray you, 
consider from this day and forward—
before a stone was laid upon a stone in 
the temple of the LORD, 16through all 
that time, when one came to a heap of 
twenty measures, there were but ten; 
when one came to the winevat to draw 
out fifty press-measures, there were 
but twenty; 17I smote you with blasting 
and with mildew and with hail in all 
the work of your hands; yet ye turned 
not to Me, saith the LORD—18consider, 
I pray you, from this day and forward, 
from the four and twentieth day of the 
ninth month, even from the day that 
the foundation of the LORD’S temple 
was laid, consider it; 19is the seed yet 
in the barn? yea, the vine, and the fig-
tree, and the pomegranate, and the 
olive-tree hath not brought forth—
from this day will I bless you.’

20And the word of the LORD came 
the second time unto Haggai in the 
four and twentieth day of the month, 
saying: 21’Speak to Zerubbabel, 
governor of Judah, saying: I will shake 
the heavens and the earth; 22and I will 
overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and 
I will destroy the strength of the 
kingdoms of the nations; and I will 
overthrow the chariots, and those that 
ride in them; and the horses and their 
riders shall come down, every one by 
the sword of his brother. 23In that day, 
saith the LORD of hosts, will I take 
thee, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the 
son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and 
will make thee as a signet; for I have 
chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.’
