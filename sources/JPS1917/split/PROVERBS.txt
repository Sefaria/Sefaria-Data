PROVERBS 

 

The proverbs of Solomon the son 
of David, king of Israel; 

2To know wisdom and instruction; 

To comprehend the words of 
understanding; 

3To receive the discipline of 
wisdom, 

Justice, and right, and equity; 

4To give prudence to the simple, 

To the young man knowledge and 
discretion; 

5That the wise man may hear, and 
increase in learning, 

And the man of understanding may 
attain unto wise counsels; 

6To understand a proverb, and a 
figure; 

The words of the wise, and their 
dark sayings. 

 

7The fear of the LORD is the 
beginning of knowledge; 

But the foolish despise wisdom and 
discipline. 

 

8Hear, my son, the instruction of thy 
father, 

And forsake not the teaching of thy 
mother; 

9For they shall be a chaplet of grace 
unto thy head, 

And chains about thy neck. 

 

10My son, if sinners entice thee, 

Consent thou not. 

11If they say: ‘Come with us, 

Let us lie in wait for blood, 

Let us lurk for the innocent without 
cause; 

12Let us swallow them up alive as 
the grave, 

And whole, as those that go down 
into the pit; 

13We shall find all precious 
substance, 

We shall fill our houses with spoil; 

14Cast in thy lot among us; 

Let us all have one purse’— 

15My son, walk not thou in the way 
with them, 

Restrain thy foot from their path; 

16For their feet run to evil, 

A nd they make haste to shed blood. 

17For in vain the net is spread 

In the eyes of any bird; 

18And these lie in wait for their own 
blood, 

They lurk for their own lives. 

19So are the ways of every one that 
is greedy of gain; 

It taketh away the life of the owners 
thereof. 

 

20Wisdom crieth aloud in the streets, 

She uttereth her voice in the broad 
places; 

21She calleth at the head of the noisy 
streets, 
1 




At the entrances of the gates, in the 
city, she uttereth her words: 

22’How long, ye thoughtless, will ye 
love thoughtlessness? 

And how long will scorners delight 
them in scorning, 

And fools hate knowledge? 

23Turn you at my reproof; 

Behold, I will pour out my spirit 
unto you, 

I will make known my words unto 
you. 

24Because I have called, and ye 
refused, 

I have stretched out my hand, and 
no man attended, 

25But ye have set at nought all my 
counsel, 

And would none of my reproof; 

26I also, in your calamity, will laugh, 

I will mock when your dread 
cometh; 

27When your dread cometh as a 
storm, 

And your calamity cometh on as a 
whirlwind; 

When trouble and distress come 
upon you. 

28Then will they call me, but I will 
not answer, 

They will seek me earnestly, but 
they shall not find me. 

29For that they hated knowledge, 

And did not choose the fear of the 
LORD; 

30They would none of my counsel, 

They despised all my reproof. 

31Therefore shall they eat of the fruit 
of their own way, 

And be filled with their own 
devices. 

32For the waywardness of the 
thoughtless shall slay them, 

And the confidence of fools shall 
destroy them. 

33But whoso hearkeneth unto me 
shall dwell securely, 

And shall be quiet without fear of 
evil.’ 

 

My son, if thou wilt receive my 
words, 

And lay up my commandments with 
thee; 

2So that thou make thine ear attend 
unto wisdom, 

And thy heart incline to 
discernment; 

3Yea, if thou call for understanding, 

And lift up thy voice for 
discernment; 

4If thou seek her as silver, 

And search for her as for hid 
treasures; 

5Then shalt thou understand the fear 
of the LORD, 

And find the knowledge of God. 

6For the LORD giveth wisdom, 

Out of His mouth cometh 
knowledge and discernment; 

7He layeth up sound wisdom for the 
upright, 

He is a shield to them that walk in 
integrity; 

8That He may guard the paths of 
justice, 

And preserve the way of His godly 
ones. 
2 




9Then shalt thou understand 
righteousness and justice, 

And equity, yea, every good path. 

10For wisdom shall enter into thy 
heart, 

And knowledge shall be pleasant 
unto thy soul; 

11Discretion shall watch over thee, 

Discernment shall guard thee; 

12To deliver thee from the way of 
evil, 

From the men that speak froward 
things; 

13Who leave the paths of 
uprightness, 

To walk in the ways of darkness; 

14Who rejoice to do evil, 

And delight in the frowardness of 
evil; 

15Who are crooked in their ways, 

And perverse in their paths; 

16To deliver thee from the strange 
woman, 

Even from the alien woman that 
maketh smooth her words; 

17That forsaketh the lord of her 
youth, 

And forgetteth the covenant of her 
God. 

18For her house sinketh down unto 
death, 

And her paths unto the shades; 

19None that go unto her return, 

Neither do they attain unto the paths 
of life; 

20That thou mayest walk in the way 
of good men, 

And keep the paths of the righteous. 

21For the upright shall dwell in the 
land, 

And the whole-hearted shall remain 
in it. 

22But the wicked shall be cut off 
from the land, 

And the faithless shall be plucked 
up out of it. 

 

My son, forget not my teaching; 

But let thy heart keep my 
commandments; 

2For length of days, and years of 
life, 

And peace, will they add to thee. 

3Let not kindness and truth forsake 
thee; 

Bind them about thy neck, write 
them upon the table of thy heart; 

4So shalt thou find grace and good 
favour 

In the sight of God and man. 

 

5Trust in the LORD with all thy heart, 

And lean not upon thine own 
understanding. 

6In all thy ways acknowledge Him, 

And He will direct thy paths. 

 

7Be not wise in thine own eyes; 

Fear the LORD, and depart from evil; 

8It shall be health to thy navel, 

And marrow to thy bones. 

 

9Honour the LORD with thy 
substance, 

And with the first-fruits of all thine 
increase; 
3 




10So shall thy barns be filled with 
plenty, 

And thy vats shall overflow with 
new wine. 

11My son, despise not the chastening 
of the LORD, 

Neither spurn thou His correction; 

12For whom the LORD loveth He 
correcteth, 

Even as a father the son in whom he 
delighteth. 

 

13Happy is the man that findeth 
wisdom, 

And the man that obtaineth 
understanding. 

14For the merchandise of it is better 
than the merchandise of silver, 

And the gain thereof than fine gold. 

15She is more precious than rubies; 

And all the things thou canst desire 
are not to be compared unto her. 

16Length of days is in her right hand; 

In her left hand are riches and 
honour. 

17Her ways are ways of 
pleasantness, 

And all her paths are peace. 

18She is a tree of life to them that lay 
hold upon her, 

And happy is every one that holdest 
her fast. 

 

19The LORD by wisdom founded the 
earth; 

By understanding He established the 
heavens. 

20By His knowledge the depths were 
broken up, 

And the skies drop down the dew. 

 

21My son, let not them depart from 
thine eyes; 

Keep sound wisdom and discretion; 

22So shall they be life unto thy soul, 

And grace to thy neck. 

23Then shalt thou walk in thy way 
securely, 

And thou shalt not dash thy foot. 

24When thou liest down, thou shalt 
not be afraid; 

Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy 
sleep shall be sweet. 

 

25Be not afraid of sudden terror, 

Neither of the destruction of the 
wicked, when it cometh; 

26For the LORD will be thy 
confidence, 

And will keep thy foot from being 
caught. 

 

27Withhold not good from him to 
whom it is due, 

When it is in the power of thy hand 
to do it. 

28Say not unto thy neighbour: ‘Go, 
and come again, 

And to-morrow I will give’; when 
thou hast it by thee. 

 

29Devise not evil against thy 
neighbour, 

Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. 

30Strive not with a man without 
cause, 

If he have done thee no harm. 

 


31Envy thou not the man of violence, 

And choose none of his ways. 

32For the perverse is an abomination 
to the LORD; 

But His counsel is with the upright. 

 

33The curse of the LORD is in the 
house of the wicked; 

But He blesseth the habitation of the 
righteous. 

34If it concerneth the scorners, He 
scorneth them, 

But unto the humble He giveth 
grace. 

35The wise shall inherit honour; 

But as for the fools, they carry away 
shame. 

 

Hear, ye children, the instruction 
of a father, 

And attend to know understanding. 

2For I give you good doctrine; 

Forsake ye not my teaching. 

3For I was a son unto my father, 

Tender and an only one in the sight 
of my mother. 

4And he taught me, and said unto 
me: 

‘Let thy heart hold fast my words, 

Keep my commandments, and live; 

5Get wisdom, get understanding; 

Forget not, neither decline from the 
words of my mouth; 

6Forsake her not, and she will 
preserve thee; 

Love her, and she will keep thee. 

7The beginning of wisdom is: Get 
wisdom; 

Yea, with all thy getting get 
understanding. 

8Extol her, and she will exalt thee; 

She will bring thee to honour, when 
thou dost embrace her. 

9She will give to thy head a chaplet 
of grace; 

A crown of glory will she bestow on 
thee.’ 

10Hear, O my son, and receive my 
sayings; 

And the years of thy life shall be 
many. 

11I have taught thee in the way of 
wisdom; 

I have led thee in paths of 
uprightness. 

12When thou goest, thy step shall not 
be straitened; 

And if thou runnest, thou shalt not 
stumble. 

13Take fast hold of instruction, let 
her not go; 

Keep her, for she is thy life. 

 

14Enter not into the path of the 
wicked, 

And walk not in the way of evil 
men. 

15Avoid it, pass not by it; 

Turn from it, and pass on. 

16For they sleep not, except they 
have done evil; 

And their sleep is taken away, 
unless they cause some to fall. 

17For they eat the bread of 
wickedness, 

And drink the wine of violence. 
4 




18But the path of the righteous is as 
the light of dawn, 

That shineth more and more unto 
the perfect day. 

19The way of the wicked is as 
darkness; 

They know not at what they 
stumble. 

 

20My son, attend to my words; 

Incline thine ear unto my sayings. 

21Let them not depart from thine 
eyes; 

Keep them in the midst of thy heart. 

22For they are life unto those that 
find them, 

And health to all their flesh. 

23Above all that thou guardest keep 
thy heart; 

For out of it are the issues of life. 

24Put away from thee a froward 
mouth, 

And perverse lips put far from thee. 

25Let thine eyes look right on, 

And let thine eyelids look straight 
before thee. 

26Make plain the path of thy feet, 

And let all thy ways be established. 

27Turn not to the right hand nor to 
the left; 

Remove thy foot from evil. 

 

My son, attend unto my wisdom; 

Incline thine ear to my 
understanding; 

2That thou mayest preserve 
discretion, 

And that thy lips may keep 
knowledge. 

3For the lips of a strange woman 
drop honey, 

And her mouth is smoother than oil; 

4But her end is bitter as wormwood, 

Sharp as a two-edged sword. 

5Her feet go down to death; 

Her steps take hold on the nether-
world; 

6Lest she should walk the even path 
of life, 

Her ways wander, but she knoweth 
it not. 

 

7Now therefore, O ye children, 
hearken unto me, 

And depart not from the words of 
my mouth. 

8Remove thy way far from her, 

And come not nigh the door of her 
house; 

9Lest thou give thy vigour unto 
others, 

And thy years unto the cruel; 

10Lest strangers be filled with thy 
strength, 

And thy labours be in the house of 
an alien; 

11And thou moan, when thine end 
cometh, 

When thy flesh and thy body are 
consumed, 

12And say: ‘How have I hated 
instruction, 

And my heart despised reproof; 

13Neither have I hearkened to the 
voice of my teachers, 

Nor inclined mine ear to them that 
instructed me! 

14I was well nigh in all evil 
5 




In the midst of the congregation and 
assembly.’ 

 

15Drink waters out of thine own 
cistern, 

And running waters out of thine 
own well. 

16Let thy springs be dispersed 
abroad, 

And courses of water in the streets. 

17Let them be only thine own, 

And not strangers’with thee. 

18Let thy fountain be blessed; 

And have joy of the wife of thy 
youth. 

19A lovely hind and a graceful doe, 

Let her breasts satisfy thee at all 
times; 

With her love be thou ravished 
always. 

20Why then wilt thou, my son, be 
ravished with a strange woman, 

And embrace the bosom of an alien? 

 

21For the ways of man are before the 
eyes of the LORD, 

And He maketh even all his paths. 

22His own iniquities shall ensnare 
the wicked, 

And he shall be holden with the 
cords of his sin. 

23He shall die for lack of instruction; 

And in the greatness of his folly he 
shall reel. 

 

My son, if thou art become surety 
for thy neighbour, 

If thou hast struck thy hands for a 
stranger— 

2Thou art snared by the words of thy 
mouth, 

Thou art caught by the words of thy 
mouth— 

3Do this now, my son, and deliver 
thyself, 

Seeing thou art come into the hand 
of thy neighbour; 

Go, humble thyself, and urge thy 
neighbour. 

4Give not sleep to thine eyes, 

 nor slumber to thine eyelids. 

5Deliver thyself as a gazelle from 
the hand [of the hunter], 

And as a bird from the hand of the 
fowler. 

 

6Go to the ant, thou sluggard; 

Consider her ways, and be wise; 

7Which having no chief, 

Overseer, or ruler, 

8Provideth her bread in the summer, 

And gatherest her food in the 
harvest. 

9How long wilt thou sleep, O 
sluggard? 

When wilt thou arise out of thy 
sleep? 

10’Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, 

A little folding of the hands to 
sleep’— 

11So shall thy poverty come as a 
runner, 

And thy want as an armed man. 

 

12A base person, a man of iniquity, 

Is he that walketh with a froward 
mouth; 
6 




13That winketh with his eyes, that 
scrapeth with his feet, 

That pointeth with his fingers; 

14Frowardness is in his heart, he 
deviseth evil continually; 

He soweth discord. 

15Therefore shall his calamity come 
suddenly; 

On a sudden shall he be broken, and 
that without remedy. 

 

16There are six things which the 
LORD hateth, 

Yea, seven which are an 
abomination unto Him: 

17Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, 

And hands that shed innocent blood; 

18A heart that deviseth wicked 
thoughts, 

Feet that are swift in running to evil; 

19A false witness that breatheth out 
lies, 

And he that soweth discord among 
brethren. 

 

20My son, keep the commandment 
of thy father, 

And forsake not the teaching of thy 
mother; 

21Bind them continually upon thy 
heart, 

Tie them about thy neck. 

22When thou walkest, it shall lead 
thee, 

When thou liest down, it shall watch 
over thee; 

And when thou awakest, it shall talk 
with thee. 

23For the commandment is a lamp, 
and the teaching is light, 

And reproofs of instruction are the 
way of life; 

24To keep thee from the evil woman, 

From the smoothness of the alien 
tongue. 

25Lust not after her beauty in thy 
heart; 

Neither let her captivate thee with 
her eyelids. 

26For on account of a harlot a man is 
brought to a loaf of bread, 

But the adulteress hunteth for the 
precious life. 

27Can a man take fire in his bosom, 

And his clothes not be burned? 

28Or can one walk upon hot coals, 

And his feet not be scorched? 

29So he that goeth in to his 
neighbour’s wife; 

Whosoever toucheth her shall not go 
unpunished. 

30Men do not despise a thief, if he 
steal 

To satisfy his soul when he is 
hungry; 

31But if he be found, he must restore 
sevenfold, 

He must give all the substance of his 
house. 

32He that committeth adultery with a 
woman lacketh understanding; 

He doeth it that would destroy his 
own soul. 

33Wounds and dishonour shall he 
get, 

And his reproach shall not be wiped 
away. 


34For jealousy is the rage of a man, 

And he will not spare in the day of 
vengeance. 

35He will not regard any ransom; 

Neither will he rest content, though 
thou givest many gifts. 

 

My son, keep my words, 

And lay up my commandments 
with thee. 

2Keep my commandments and live, 

And my teaching as the apple of 
thine eye. 

3Bind them upon thy fingers, 

Write them upon the table of thy 
heart. 

4Say unto wisdom: ‘Thou art my 
sister’, 

And call understanding thy 
kinswoman; 

5That they may keep thee from the 
strange woman, 

From the alien woman that maketh 
smooth her words. 

 

6For at the window of my house 

I looked forth through my lattice; 

7And I beheld among the 
thoughtless ones, 

I discerned among the youths, 

A young man void of understanding, 

8Passing through the street near her 
corner, 

And he went the way to her house; 

9In the twilight, in the evening of the 
day, 

In the blackness of night and the 
darkness. 

10And, behold, there met him a 
woman 

With the attire of a harlot, and wily 
of heart. 

11She is riotous and rebellious, 

Her feet abide not in her house; 

12Now she is in the streets, now in 
the broad places, 

And lieth in wait at every corner. 

13So she caught him, and kissed 
him, 

And with an impudent face she said 
unto him: 

14’Sacrifices of peace-offerings were 
due from me; 

This day have I paid my vows. 

15Therefore came I forth to meet 
thee, 

To seek thy face, and I have found 
thee. 

16I have decked my couch with 
coverlets, 

With striped cloths of the yarn of 
Egypt. 

17I have perfumed my bed 

With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

18Come, let us take our fill of love 
until the morning; 

Let us solace ourselves with loves. 

19For my husband is not at home, 

He is gone a long journey; 

20He hath taken the bag of money 
with him; 

He will come home at the full 
moon.’ 

 

21With her much fair speech she 
causeth him to yield, 
7 




With the blandishment of her lips 
she enticeth him away. 

22He goeth after her straightway, 

As an ox that goeth to the slaughter, 

Or as one in fetters to the correction 
of the fool; 

23Till an arrow strike through his 
liver; 

As a bird hasteneth to the snare— 

And knoweth not that it is at the cost 
of his life. 

 

24Now therefore, O ye children, 
hearken unto me, 

And attend to the words of my 
mouth. 

25Let not thy heart decline to her 
ways, 

Go not astray in her paths. 

26For she hath cast down many 
wounded; 

Yea, a mighty host are all her slain. 

27Her house is the way to the nether-
world, 

Going down to the chambers of 
death. 

 

Doth not wisdom call, 

And understanding put forth her 
voice? 

2In the top of high places by the 
way, 

Where the paths meet, she standeth; 

3Beside the gates, at the entry of the 
city, 

At the coming in at the doors, she 
crieth aloud: 

4’Unto you, O men, I call, 

And my voice is to the sons of men. 

5O ye thoughtless, understand 
prudence, 

And, ye fools, be ye of an 
understanding heart. 

6Hear, for I will speak excellent 
things, 

And the opening of my lips shall be 
right things. 

7For my mouth shall utter truth, 

And wickedness is an abomination 
to my lips. 

8All the words of my mouth are in 
righteousness, 

There is nothing perverse or 
crooked in them. 

9They are all plain to him that 
understandeth, 

And right to them that find 
knowledge. 

10Receive my instruction, and not 
silver, 

And knowledge rather than choice 
gold. 

11For wisdom is better than rubies, 

And all things desirable are not to 
be compared unto her. 

12I wisdom dwell with prudence, 

And find out knowledge of devices. 

13The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; 

Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil 
way, 

And the froward mouth, do I hate. 

14Counsel is mine, and sound 
wisdom; 

I am understanding, power is mine. 

15By me kings reign, 

And princes decree justice. 

16By me princes rule, 
8 




And nobles, even all the judges of 
the earth. 

17I love them that love me, 

And those that seek me earnestly 
shall find me. 

18Riches and honour are with me; 

Yea, enduring riches and 
righteousness. 

19My fruit is better than gold, yea, 
than fine gold; 

And my produce than choice silver. 

20I walk in the way of righteousness, 

In the midst of the paths of justice; 

21That I may cause those that love 
me to inherit substance, 

And that I may fill their treasuries. 

 

22The LORD made me as the 
beginning of His way, 

The first of His works of old. 

23I was set up from everlasting, from 
the beginning, 

Or ever the earth was. 

24When there were no depths, I was 
brought forth; 

When there were no fountains 
abounding with water. 

25Before the mountains were settled, 

Before the hills was I brought forth; 

26While as yet He had not made the 
earth, nor the fields, 

Nor the beginning of the dust of the 
world. 

27When He established the heavens, 
I was there; 

When He set a circle upon the face 
of the deep, 

28When He made firm the skies 
above, 

When the fountains of the deep 
showed their might, 

29When He gave to the sea His 
decree, 

That the waters should not 
transgress His commandment, 

When He appointed the foundations 
of the earth; 

30Then I was by Him, as a nursling; 

And I was daily all delight, 

Playing always before Him, 

31Playing in His habitable earth, 

And my delights are with the sons 
of men. 

 

32Now therefore, ye children, 
hearken unto me; 

For happy are they that keep my 
ways. 

33Hear instruction, and be wise, 

And refuse it not. 

34Happy is the man that hearkeneth 
to me, 

Watching daily at my gates, waiting 
at the posts of my doors. 

35For whoso findeth me findeth life, 

And obtaineth favour of the LORD. 

36But he that misseth me wrongeth 
his own soul; 

All they that hate me love death.’ 

 

Wisdom hath builded her house, 

She hath hewn out her seven 
pillars; 

2She hath prepared her meat, she 
hath mingled her wine; 

She hath also furnished her table. 

3She hath sent forth her maidens, 
she calleth, 
9 




Upon the highest places of the city: 

4’Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn 
in hither’; 

As for him that lacketh 
understanding, she saith to him: 

5’Come, eat of my bread, 

And drink of the wine which I have 
mingled. 

6Forsake all thoughtlessness, and 
live; 

And walk in the way of 
understanding. 

7He that correcteth a scorner getteth 
to himself shame, 

And he that reproveth a wicked 
man, it becometh unto him a blot. 

8Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate 
thee; 

Reprove a wise man, and he will 
love thee. 

9Give to a wise man, and he will be 
yet wiser; 

Teach a righteous man, and he will 
increase in learning. 

10The fear of the LORD is the 
beginning of wisdom, 

And the knowledge of the All-holy 
is understanding. 

11For by me thy days shall be 
multiplied, 

And the years of thy life shall be 
increased. 

12If thou art wise, thou art wise for 
thyself; 

And if thou scornest, thou alone 
shalt bear it.’ 

 

13The woman Folly is riotous; 

She is thoughtless, and knoweth 
nothing. 

14And she sitteth at the door of her 
house, 

On a seat in the high places of the 
city, 

15To call to them that pass by, 

Who go right on their ways: 

16’Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn 
in hither’; 

And as for him that lacketh 
understanding, she saith to him: 

17’Stolen waters are sweet, 

And bread eaten in secret is 
pleasant.’ 

18But he knoweth not that the shades 
are there; 

That her guests are in the depths of 
the nether-world. 

 

The proverbs of Solomon. 

 

A wise son maketh a glad father; 

But a foolish son is the grief of his 
mother. 

 

2Treasures of wickedness profit 
nothing; 

But righteousness delivereth from 
death. 

 

3The LORD will not suffer the soul of 
the righteous to famish; 

But He thrusteth away the desire of 
the wicked. 

 

4He becometh poor that dealeth with 
a slack hand; 
10 




But the hand of the diligent maketh 
rich. 

 

5A wise son gathereth in summer; 

But a son that doeth shamefully 
sleepeth in harvest. 

 

6Blessings are upon the head of the 
righteous; 

But the mouth of the wicked 
concealeth violence. 

 

7The memory of the righteous shall 
be for a blessing; 

But the name of the wicked shall 
rot. 

 

8The wise in heart will receive 
commandments; 

But a prating fool shall fall. 

 

9He that walketh uprightly walketh 
securely; 

But he that perverteth his ways shall 
be found out. 

 

10He that winketh with the eye 
causeth sorrow; 

And a prating fool shall fall. 

 

11The mouth of the righteous is a 
fountain of life; 

But the mouth of the wicked 
concealeth violence. 

 

12Hatred stirreth up strifes; 

But love covereth all transgressions. 

 

13In the lips of him that hath 
discernment wisdom is found; 

But a rod is for the back of him that 
is void of understanding. 

 

14Wise men lay up knowledge; 

But the mouth of the foolish is an 
imminent ruin. 

15The rich man’s wealth is his strong 
city; 

The ruin of the poor is their poverty. 

 

16The wages of the righteous is life; 

The increase of the wicked is sin. 

 

17He is in the way of life that 
heedeth instruction; 

But he that forsaketh reproof erreth. 

 

18He that hideth hatred is of lying 
lips; 

And he that uttereth a slander is a 
fool. 

 

19In the multitude of words there 
wanteth not transgression; 

But he that refraineth his lips is 
wise. 

 

20The tongue of the righteous is as 
choice silver; 

The heart of the wicked is little 
worth. 

 

21The lips of the righteous feed 
many; 

But the foolish die for want of 
understanding. 

 


22The blessing of the LORD, it 
maketh rich, 

And toil addeth nothing thereto. 

 

23It is as sport to a fool to do 
wickedness, 

And so is wisdom to a man of 
discernment. 

 

24The fear of the wicked, it shall 
come upon him; 

And the desire of the righteous shall 
be granted. 

 

25When the whirlwind passeth, the 
wicked is no more; 

But the righteous is an everlasting 
foundation. 

 

26As vinegar to the teeth, and as 
smoke to the eyes, 

So is the sluggard to them that send 
him. 

 

27The fear of the LORD prolongeth 
days; 

But the years of the wicked shall be 
shortened. 

 

28The hope of the righteous is 
gladness; 

But the expectation of the wicked 
shall perish. 

 

29The way of the LORD is a 
stronghold to the upright, 

But ruin to the workers of iniquity. 

 

30The righteous shall never be 
moved; 

But the wicked shall not inhabit the 
land. 

 

31The mouth of the righteous 
buddeth with wisdom; 

But the froward tongue shall be cut 
off. 

 

32The lips of the righteous know 
what is acceptable; 

But the mouth of the wicked is all 
frowardness. 

 

A false balance is an 
abomination to the LORD; 

But a perfect weight is His delight. 

 

2When pride cometh, then cometh 
shame; 

But with the lowly is wisdom. 

 

3The integrity of the upright shall 
guide them; 

But the perverseness of the faithless 
shall destroy them. 

 

4Riches profit not in the day of 
wrath; 

But righteousness delivereth from 
death. 

 

5The righteousness of the sincere 
shall make straight his way; 

But the wicked shall fall by his own 
wickedness. 

 
11 




6The righteousness of the upright 
shall deliver them; 

But the faithless shall be trapped in 
their own crafty device. 

 

7When a wicked man dieth, his 
expectation shall perish, 

And the hope of strength perisheth. 

 

8The righteous is delivered out of 
trouble, 

And the wicked cometh in his stead. 

 

9With his mouth the impious man 
destroyeth his neighbour; 

But through knowledge shall the 
righteous be delivered. 

 

10When it goeth well with the 
righteous, the city rejoiceth; 

And when the wicked perish, there 
is joy. 

 

11By the blessing of the upright a 
city is exalted; 

But it is overthrown by the mouth of 
the wicked. 

 

12He that despiseth his neighbour 
lacketh understanding; 

But a man of discernment holdeth 
his peace. 

 

13He that goeth about as a talebearer 
revealeth secrets; 

But he that is of a faithful spirit 
concealeth a matter. 

 

14Where no wise direction is, a 
people falleth; 

But in the multitude of counsellors 
there is safety. 

 

15He that is surety for a stranger 
shall smart for it; 

But he that hateth them that strike 
hands is secure. 

 

16A gracious woman obtaineth 
honour; 

And strong men obtain riches. 

 

17The merciful man doeth good to 
his own soul; 

But he that is cruel troubleth his 
own flesh. 

 

18The wicked earneth deceitful 
wages; 

But he that soweth righteousness 
hath a sure reward. 

 

19Stedfast righteousness tendeth to 
life; 

But he that pursueth evil pursueth it 
to his own death. 

 

20They that are perverse in heart are 
an abomination to the LORD; 

But such as are upright in their way 
are His delight. 

 

21My hand upon it! the evil man 
shall not be unpunished; 

But the seed of the righteous shall 
escape. 

 


22As a ring of gold in a swine’s 
snout, so is a fair woman that 
turneth aside from discretion. 

 

23The desire of the righteous is only 
good; 

But the expectation of the wicked is 
wrath. 

 

24There is that scattereth, and yet 
increaseth; 

And there is that withholdeth more 
than is meet, but it tendeth only to 
want. 

 

25The beneficent soul shall be made 
rich, and he that satisfieth 
abundantly shall be satisfied also 
himself. 

 

26He that withholdeth corn, the 
people shall curse him; 

But blessing shall be upon the head 
of him that selleth it. 

 

27He that diligently seeketh good 
seeketh favour; 

But he that searcheth for evil, it 
shall come unto him. 

 

28He that trusteth in his riches shall 
fall; 

But the righteous shall flourish as 
foliage. 

 

29He that troubleth his own house 
shall inherit the wind; 

And the foolish shall be servant to 
the wise of heart. 

 

30The fruit of the righteous is a tree 
of life; 

And he that is wise winneth souls. 

 

31Behold, the righteous shall be 
requited in the earth; 

How much more the wicked and the 
sinner! 

 

Whoso loveth knowledge 
loveth correction; 

But he that is brutish hateth reproof. 

 

2A good man shall obtain favour of 
the LORD; 

But a man of wicked devices will 
He condemn. 

 

3A man shall not be established by 
wickedness; 

But the root of the righteous shall 
never be moved. 

 

4A virtuous woman is a crown to her 
husband; 

But she that doeth shamefully is as 
rottenness in his bones. 

 

5The thoughts of the righteous are 
right; 

But the counsels of the wicked are 
deceit. 

 

6The words of the wicked are to lie 
in wait for blood; 

But the mouth of the upright shall 
deliver them. 

 
12 




7The wicked are overthrown, and 
are not; 

But the house of the righteous shall 
stand. 

 

8A man shall be commended 
according to his intelligence; 

But he that is of a distorted 
understanding shall be despised. 

 

9Better is he that is lightly esteemed, 
and hath a servant, 

Than he that playeth the man of 
rank, and lacketh bread. 

 

10A righteous man regardeth the life 
of his beast; 

But the tender mercies of the wicked 
are cruel. 

 

11He that tilleth his ground shall 
have plenty of bread; 

But he that followeth after vain 
things is void of understanding. 

 

12The wicked desireth the prey of 
evil men; 

But the root of the righteous 
yieldeth fruit. 

 

13In the transgression of the lips is a 
snare to the evil man; 

But the righteous cometh out of 
trouble. 

 

14A man shall be satisfied with good 
by the fruit of his mouth, 

And the doings of a man’s hands 
shall be rendered unto him. 

 

15The way of a fool is straight in his 
own eyes; 

But he that is wise hearkeneth unto 
counsel. 

 

16A fool’s vexation is presently 
known; 

But a prudent man concealeth 
shame. 

 

17He that breatheth forth truth 
uttereth righteousness; 

But a false witness deceit. 

 

18There is that speaketh like the 
piercings of a sword; 

But the tongue of the wise is health. 

 

19The lip of truth shall be 
established for ever; 

But a lying tongue is but for a 
moment. 

 

20Deceit is in the heart of them that 
devise evil; 

But to the counsellors of peace is 
joy. 

 

21There shall no mischief befall the 
righteous; 

But the wicked are filled with evil. 

 

22Lying lips are an abomination to 
the LORD; 

But they that deal truly are His 
delight. 

 


23A prudent man concealeth 
knowledge; 

But the heart of fools proclaimeth 
foolishness. 

 

24The hand of the diligent shall bear 
rule; 

But the slothful shall be under 
tribute. 

 

25Care in the heart of a man boweth 
it down; 

But a good word maketh it glad. 

 

26The righteous is guided by his 
friend; 

But the way of the wicked leadeth 
them astray. 

 

27The slothful man shall not hunt his 
prey; 

But the precious substance of men is 
to be diligent. 

 

28In the way of righteousness is life, 

And in the pathway thereof there is 
no death. 

 

A wise son is instructed of his 
father; 

But a scorner heareth not rebuke. 

 

2A man shall eat good from the fruit 
of his mouth; 

But the desire of the faithless is 
violence. 

 

3He that guardeth his mouth keepeth 
his life; 

But for him that openeth wide his 
lips there shall be ruin. 

 

4The soul of the sluggard desireth, 
and hath nothing; 

But the soul of the diligent shall be 
abundantly gratified. 

 

5A righteous man hateth lying; 

But a wicked man behaveth vilely 
and shamefully. 

 

6Righteousness guardeth him that is 
upright in the way; 

But wickedness overthroweth the 
sinner. 

 

7There is that pretendeth himself 
rich, yet hath nothing; 

There is that pretendeth himself 
poor, yet hath great wealth. 

 

8The ransom of a man’s life are his 
riches; 

But the poor heareth no threatening. 

 

9The light of the righteous rejoiceth; 

But the lamp of the wicked shall be 
put out. 

 

10By pride cometh only contention; 

But with the well-advised is 
wisdom. 

 

11Wealth gotten by vanity shall be 
diminished; 

But he that gathereth little by little 
shall increase. 

 
13 




12Hope deferred maketh the heart 
sick; 

But desire fulfilled is a tree of life. 

 

13Whoso despiseth the word shall 
suffer thereby; 

But he that feareth the 
commandment shall be rewarded. 

 

14The teaching of the wise is a 
fountain of life, 

To depart from the snares of death. 

 

15Good understanding giveth grace; 

But the way of the faithless is harsh. 

 

16Every prudent man dealeth with 
forethought; 

But a fool unfoldeth folly. 

 

17A wicked messenger falleth into 
evil; 

But a faithful ambassador is health. 

 

18Poverty and shame shall be to him 
that refuseth instruction; 

But he that regardeth reproof shall 
be honoured. 

 

19The desire accomplished is sweet 
to the soul; 

And it is an abomination to fools to 
depart from evil. 

 

20He that walketh with wise men 
shall be wise; 

But the companion of fools shall 
smart for it. 

 

21Evil pursueth sinners; 

But to the righteous good shall be 
repaid. 

 

22A good man leaveth an inheritance 
to his children’s children; 

And the wealth of the sinner is laid 
up for the righteous. 

 

23Much food is in the tillage of the 
poor; 

But there is that is swept away by 
want of righteousness. 

 

24He that spareth his rod hateth his 
son; 

But he that loveth him chasteneth 
him betimes. 

 

25The righteous eateth to the 
satisfying of his desire; 

But the belly of the wicked shall 
want. 

 

Every wise woman buildeth 
her house; 

But the foolish plucketh it down 
with her hands. 

 

2He that walketh in his uprightness 
feareth the LORD; 

But he that is perverse in his ways 
despiseth Him. 

 

3In the mouth of the foolish is a rod 
of pride; 

But the lips of the wise shall 
preserve them. 

 
14 




4Where no oxen are, the crib is 
clean; 

But much increase is by the strength 
of the ox. 

 

5A faithful witness will not lie; 

But a false witness breatheth forth 
lies. 

 

6A scorner seeketh wisdom, and 
findeth it not; 

But knowledge is easy unto him that 
hath discernment. 

 

7Go from the presence of a foolish 
man, for thou wilt not perceive 
the lips of knowledge. 

 

8The wisdom of the prudent is to 
look well to his way; 

But the folly of fools is deceit. 

 

9Amends pleadeth for fools; 

But among the upright there is good 
will. 

 

10The heart knoweth its own 
bitterness; 

And with its joy no stranger can 
intermeddle. 

 

11The house of the wicked shall be 
overthrown; 

But the tent of the upright shall 
flourish. 

 

12There is a way which seemeth 
right unto a man, 

But the end thereof are the ways of 
death. 

 

13Even in laughter the heart acheth; 

And the end of mirth is heaviness. 

 

14The dissembler in heart shall have 
his fill from his own ways; 

And a good man shall be satisfied 
from himself. 

 

15The thoughtless believeth every 
word; 

But the prudent man looketh well to 
his going. 

 

16A wise man feareth, and departeth 
from evil; 

But the fool behaveth overbearingly, 
and is confident. 

 

17He that is soon angry dealeth 
foolishly; 

And a man of wicked devices is 
hated. 

 

18The thoughtless come into 
possession of folly; 

But the prudent are crowned with 
knowledge. 

 

19The evil bow before the good, 

And the wicked at the gates of the 
righteous. 

 

20The poor is hated even of his own 
neighbour; 

But the rich hath many friends. 

 


21He that despiseth his neighbour 
sinneth; 

But he that is gracious unto the 
humble, happy is he. 

 

22Shall they not go astray that devise 
evil? But mercy and truth shall be 
for them that devise good. 

 

23In all labour there is profit; 

But the talk of the lips tendeth only 
to penury. 

 

24The crown of the wise is their 
riches; 

But the folly of fools remaineth 
folly. 

 

25A true witness delivereth souls; 

But he that breatheth forth lies is all 
deceit. 

 

26In the fear of the LORD a man hath 
strong confidence; 

And his children shall have a place 
of refuge. 

 

27The fear of the LORD is a fountain 
of life, to depart from the snares 
of death. 

 

28In the multitude of people is the 
king’s glory; 

But in the want of people is the ruin 
of the prince. 

 

29He that is slow to anger is of great 
understanding; 

But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth 
folly. 

 

30A tranquil heart is the life of the 
flesh; 

But envy is the rottenness of the 
bones. 

 

31He that oppresseth the poor 
blasphemeth his Maker; 

But he that is gracious unto the 
needy honoureth Him. 

 

32The wicked is thrust down in his 
misfortune; 

But the righteous, even when he is 
brought to death, hath hope. 

 

33In the heart of him that hath 
discernment wisdom resteth; 

But in the inward part of fools it 
maketh itself known. 

 

34Righteousness exalteth a nation; 

But sin is a reproach to any people. 

 

35The king’s favour is toward a 
servant that dealeth wisely; 

But his wrath striketh him that 
dealeth shamefully. 

 

A soft answer turneth away 
wrath; 

But a grievous word stirreth up 
anger. 

 

2The tongue of the wise useth 
knowledge aright; 
15 




But the mouth of fools poureth out 
foolishness. 

 

3The eyes of the LORD are in every 
place, 

Keeping watch upon the evil and the 
good. 

 

4A soothing tongue is a tree of life; 

But perverseness therein is a wound 
to the spirit. 

 

5A fool despiseth his father’s 
correction; 

But he that regardeth reproof is 
prudent. 

 

6In the house of the righteous is 
much treasure; 

But in the revenues of the wicked is 
trouble. 

 

7The lips of the wise disperse 
knowledge; 

But the heart of the foolish is not 
stedfast. 

 

8The sacrifice of the wicked is an 
abomination to the LORD; 

But the prayer of the upright is His 
delight. 

 

9The way of the wicked is an 
abomination to the LORD; 

But He loveth him that followeth 
after righteousness. 

 

10There is grievous correction for 
him that forsaketh the way; 

And he that hateth reproof shall die. 

 

11The nether-world and Destruction 
are before the LORD; 

How much more then the hearts of 
the children of men! 

 

12A scorner loveth not to be 
reproved; 

He will not go unto the wise. 

 

13A merry heart maketh a cheerful 
countenance; 

But by sorrow of heart the spirit is 
broken. 

 

14The heart of him that hath 
discernment seeketh knowledge; 

But the mouth of fools feedeth on 
folly. 

 

15All the days of the poor are evil; 

But he that is of a merry heart hath a 
continual feast. 

 

16Better is little with the fear of the 
LORD, 

Than great treasure and turmoil 
therewith. 

 

17Better is a dinner of herbs where 
love is, 

Than a stalled ox and hatred 
therewith. 

 

18A wrathful man stirreth up 
discord; 

But he that is slow to anger 
appeaseth strife. 


 

19The way of the sluggard is as 
though hedged by thorns; 

But the path of the upright is even. 

 

20A wise son maketh a glad father; 

But a foolish man despiseth his 
mother. 

 

21Folly is joy to him that lacketh 
understanding; 

But a man of discernment walketh 
straightforwards. 

 

22For want of counsel purposes are 
frustrated; 

But in the multitude of counsellors 
they are established. 

 

23A man hath joy in the answer of 
his mouth; 

And a word in due season, how 
good is it! 

 

24The path of life goeth upward for 
the wise, that he may depart from 
the nether-world beneath. 

 

25The LORD will pluck up the house 
of the proud; 

But He will establish the border of 
the widow. 

 

26The thoughts of wickedness are an 
abomination to the LORD; 

But words of pleasantness are pure. 

 

27He that is greedy of gain troubleth 
his own house; 

But he that hateth gifts shall live. 

 

28The heart of the righteous studieth 
to answer; 

But the mouth of the wicked poureth 
out evil things. 

 

29The LORD is far from the wicked; 

But He heareth the prayer of the 
righteous. 

 

30The light of the eyes rejoiceth the 
heart; 

And a good report maketh the bones 
fat. 

 

31The ear that hearkeneth to the 
reproof of life abideth among the 
wise. 

 

32He that refuseth correction 
despiseth his own soul; 

But he that hearkeneth to reproof 
getteth understanding. 

 

33The fear of the LORD is the 
instruction of wisdom; 

And before honour goeth humility. 

 

The preparations of the heart 
are man’s, 

But the answer of the tongue is from 
the LORD. 

 

2All the ways of a man are clean in 
his own eyes; 

But the LORD weigheth the spirits. 

 

3Commit thy works unto the LORD, 
16 




And thy thoughts shall be 
established. 

 

4The LORD hath made every things 
for His own purpose, 

Yea, even the wicked for the day of 
evil. 

 

5Every one that is proud in heart is 
an abomination to the LORD; 

My hand upon it! he shall not be 
unpunished. 

 

6By mercy and truth iniquity is 
expiated; 

And by the fear of the LORD men 
depart from evil. 

 

7When a man’s ways please the 
LORD, 

He maketh even his enemies to be at 
peace with him. 

 

8Better is a little with righteousness 

Than great revenues with injustice. 

 

9A man’s heart deviseth his way; 

But the LORD directeth his steps. 

 

10A divine sentence is in the lips of 
the king; 

His mouth trespasseth not in 
judgment. 

 

11A just balance and scales are the 
LORD’S; 

All the weights of the bag are His 
work. 

 

12It is an abomination to kings to 
commit wickedness; 

For the throne is established by 
righteousness. 

 

13Righteous lips are the delight of 
kings; 

And they love him that speaketh 
right. 

 

14The wrath of a king is as 
messengers of death; 

But a wise man will pacify it. 

 

15In the light of the king’s 
countenance is life; 

And his favour is as a cloud of the 
latter rain. 

 

16How much better is it to get 
wisdom than gold! 

Yea, to get understanding is rather 
to be chosen than silver. 

 

17The highway of the upright is to 
depart from evil; 

He that keepeth his way preserveth 
his soul. 

 

18Pride goeth before destruction, 

And a haughty spirit before a fall. 

 

19Better it is to be of a lowly spirit 
with the humble, 

Than to divide the spoil with the 
proud. 

 

20He that giveth heed unto the word 
shall find good; 


And whoso trusteth in the LORD, 
happy is he. 

 

21The wise in heart is called a man 
of discernment; 

And the sweetness of the lips 
increaseth learning. 

 

22Understanding is a fountain of life 
unto him that hath it; 

But folly is the chastisement of 
fools. 

 

23The heart of the wise teacheth his 
mouth, 

And addeth learning to his lips. 

 

24Pleasant words are as a 
honeycomb, 

Sweet to the soul, and health to the 
bones. 

 

25There is a way which seemeth 
right unto a man, 

But the end thereof are the ways of 
death. 

 

26The hunger of the labouring man 
laboureth for him; 

For his mouth compelleth him. 

 

27An ungodly man diggeth up evil, 

And in his lips there is as a burning 
fire. 

 

28A froward man soweth strife; 

And a whisperer separateth familiar 
friends. 

 

29A man of violence enticeth his 
neighbour, 

And leadeth him into a way that is 
not good. 

 

30He shutteth his eyes, it is to devise 
froward things; 

He that biteth his lips bringeth evil 
to pass. 

 

31The hoary head is a crown of 
glory, 

It is found in the way of 
righteousness. 

 

32He that is slow to anger is better 
than the mighty; 

And he that ruleth his spirit than he 
that taketh a city. 

 

33The lot is cast into the lap; 

But the whole disposing thereof is 
of the LORD. 

 

Better is a dry morsel and 
quietness therewith, 

Than a house full of feasting with 
strife. 

 

2A servant that dealeth wisely shall 
have rule over a son that dealeth 
shamefully, 

And shall have part of the 
inheritance among the brethren. 

 

3The refining pot is for silver, and 
the furnace for gold; 

But the LORD trieth the hearts. 

 
17 




4A evil-doer giveth heed to wicked 
lips; 

And a liar giveth ear to a 
mischievous tongue. 

 

5Whoso mocketh the poor 
blasphemeth his Maker; 

And he that is glad at calamity shall 
not be unpunished. 

 

6Children’s children are the crown 
of old men; 

And the glory of children are their 
fathers. 

 

7Overbearing speech becometh not a 
churl; 

Much less do lying lips a prince. 

 

8A gift is as a precious stone in the 
eyes of him that hath it; 

Whithersoever he turneth, he 
prospereth. 

 

9He that covereth a transgression 
seeketh love; 

But he that harpeth on a matter 
estrangeth a familiar friend. 

 

10A rebuke entereth deeper into a 
man of understanding 

Than a hundred stripes into a fool. 

 

11A rebellious man seeketh only 
evil; 

Therefore a cruel messenger shall be 
sent against him. 

 

12Let a bear robbed of her whelps 
meet a man, 

Rather than a fool in his folly. 

 

13Whoso rewardeth evil for good, 

Evil shall not depart from his house. 

 

14The beginning of strife is as when 
one letteth out water; 

Therefore leave off contention, 
before the quarrel break out. 

 

15He that justifieth the wicked, and 
he that condemneth the righteous, 

Even they both are an abomination 
to the LORD. 

 

16Wherefore is there a price in the 
hand of a fool 

To buy wisdom, seeing he hath no 
understanding? 

 

17A friend loveth at all times, 

And a brother is born for adversity. 

 

18A man void of understanding is he 
that striketh hands, 

And becometh surety in the 
presence of his neighbour. 

 

19He loveth transgression that loveth 
strife; 

He that exalteth his gate seeketh 
destruction. 

 

20He that hath a froward heart 
findeth no good; 

And he that hath a perverse tongue 
falleth into evil. 


 

21He that begetteth a fool doeth it to 
his sorrow; 

And the father of a churl hath no 
joy. 

 

22A merry heart is a good medicine; 

But a broken spirit drieth the bones. 

 

23A wicked man taketh a gift out of 
the bosom, 

To pervert the ways of justice. 

 

24Wisdom is before him that hath 
understanding; 

But the eyes of a fool are in the ends 
of the earth. 

 

25A foolish son is vexation to his 
father, 

And bitterness to her that bore him. 

 

26To punish also the righteous is not 
good, 

Nor to strike the noble for their 
uprightness. 

 

27He that spareth his words hath 
knowledge; 

And he that husbandeth his spirit is 
a man of discernment. 

 

28Even a fool, when he holdeth his 
peace, is counted wise; 

And he that shutteth his lips is 
esteemed as a man of 
understanding. 

 

He that separateth himself 
seeketh his own desire, 

And snarlest against all sound 
wisdom. 

 

2A fool hath no delight in 
understanding, 

But only that his heart may lay itself 
bare. 

 

3When the wicked cometh, there 
cometh also contempt, 

And with ignominy reproach. 

 

4The words of a man’s mouth are as 
deep waters; 

A flowing brook, a fountain of 
wisdom. 

 

5It is not good to respect the person 
of the wicked, 

So as to turn aside the righteous in 
judgment. 

 

6A fool’s lips enter into contention, 

And his mouth calleth for strokes. 

 

7A fool’s mouth is his ruin, 

And his lips are the snare of his 
soul. 

 

8The words of a whisperer are as 
dainty morsels, 

And they go down into the 
innermost parts of the belly. 

 

9Even one that is slack in his work 

Is brother to him that is a destroyer. 

 
18 




10The name of the LORD is a strong 
tower: 

The righteous runneth into it, and is 
set up on high. 

 

11The rich man’s wealth is his strong 
city, 

And as a high wall in his own 
conceit. 

 

12Before destruction the heart of a 
man is haughty, 

And before honour goeth humility. 

 

13He that giveth answer before he 
heareth, 

It is folly and confusion unto him. 

 

14The spirit of a man will sustain his 
infirmity; 

But a broken spirit who can bear? 

 

15The heart of the prudent getteth 
knowledge; 

And the ear of the wise seeketh 
knowledge. 

 

16A man’s gift maketh room for him, 

And bringeth him before great men. 

 

17He that pleadeth his cause first 
seemeth just; 

But his neighbour cometh and 
searcheth him out. 

 

18The lot causeth strife to cease, 

And parteth asunder the contentious. 

 

19A brother offended is harder to be 
won than a strong city; 

And their contentions are like the 
bars of a castle. 

 

20A man’s belly shall be filled with 
the fruit of his mouth; 

With the increase of his lips shall he 
be satisfied. 

 

21Death and life are in the power of 
the tongue; 

And they that indulge it shall eat the 
fruit thereof. 

 

22Whoso findeth a wife findeth a 
great good, 

And obtaineth favour of the LORD. 

 

23The poor useth entreaties; 

But the rich answereth impudently. 

 

24There are friends that one hath to 
his own hurt; 

But there is a friend that sticketh 
closer than a brother. 

 

Better is the poor that walketh 
in his integrity 

Than he that is perverse in his lips 
and a fool at the same time. 

 

2Also, that the soul be without 
knowledge is not good; 

And he that hasteth with his feet 
sinneth. 

 

3The foolishness of man perverteth 
his way; 
19 




And his heart fretteth against the 
LORD. 

 

4Wealth addeth many friends; 

But as for the poor, his friend 
separateth himself from him. 

 

5A false witness shall not be 
unpunished; 

And he that breatheth forth lies shall 
not escape. 

 

6Many will entreat the favour of the 
liberal man; 

And every man is a friend to him 
that giveth gifts. 

 

7All the brethren of the poor do hate 
him; 

How much more do his friends go 
far from him! 

He that pursueth words, they turn 
against him. 

 

8He that getteth wisdom loveth his 
own soul; 

He that keepeth understanding shall 
find good. 

 

9A false witness shall not be 
unpunished; 

And he that breatheth forth lies shall 
perish. 

 

10Luxury is not seemly for a fool; 

Much less for a servant to have rule 
over princes. 

 

11It is the discretion of a man to be 
slow to anger, 

And it is his glory to pass over a 
transgression. 

 

12The king’s wrath is as the roaring 
of a lion; 

But his favour is as dew upon the 
grass. 

 

13A foolish son is the calamity of his 
father; 

And the contentions of a wife are a 
continual dropping. 

 

14House and riches are the 
inheritance of fathers; 

But a prudent wife is from the LORD. 

 

15Slothfulness casteth into a deep 
sleep; 

And the idle soul shall suffer 
hunger. 

 

16He that keepeth the commandment 
keepeth his soul; 

But he that despiseth His ways shall 
die. 

 

17He that is gracious unto the poor 
lendeth unto the LORD; 

And his good deed will He repay 
unto him. 

 

18Chasten thy son, for there is hope; 

But set not thy heart on his 
destruction. 

 


19A man of great wrath shall suffer 
punishment; 

For if thou interpose, thou wilt add 
thereto. 

 

20Hear counsel, and receive 
instruction, 

That thou mayest be wise in thy 
latter end. 

 

21There are many devices in a man’s 
heart; 

But the counsel of the LORD, that 
shall stand. 

 

22The lust of a man is his shame; 

And a poor man is better than a liar. 

 

23The fear of the LORD tendeth to 
life; 

And he that hath it shall abide 
satisfied, 

He shall not be visited with evil. 

 

24The sluggard burieth his hand in 
the dish, 

And will not so much as bring it 
back to his mouth. 

 

25When thou smitest a scorner, the 
simple will become prudent; 

And when one that hath 
understanding is reproved, he will 
understand knowledge. 

 

26A son that dealeth shamefully and 
reproachfully 

Will despoil his father, and chase 
away his mother. 

 

27Cease, my son, to hear the 
instruction 

That causeth to err from the words 
of knowledge. 

 

28An ungodly witness mocketh at 
right; 

And the mouth of the wicked 
devoureth iniquity. 

 

29Judgments are prepared for 
scorners, 

And stripes for the back of fools. 

 

Wine is a mocker, strong drink 
is riotous; 

And whosoever reeleth thereby is 
not wise. 

 

2The terror of a king is as the 
roaring of a lion: 

He that provoketh him to anger 
forfeiteth his life. 

 

3It is an honour for a man to keep 
aloof from strife; 

But every fool will be snarling. 

 

4The sluggard will not plow when 
winter setteth in; 

Therefore he shall beg in harvest, 
and have nothing. 

 

5Counsel in the heart of man is like 
deep water; 

But a man of understanding will 
draw it out. 

 
20 




6Most men will proclaim every one 
his own goodness; 

But a faithful man who can find? 

 

7He that walketh in his integrity as a 
just man, 

Happy are his children after him. 

 

8A king that sitteth on the throne of 
judgment 

Scattereth away all evil with his 
eyes. 

 

9Who can say: ‘I have made my 
heart clean, 

I am pure from my sin’? 

 

10Divers weights, and divers 
measures, 

Both of them alike are abomination 
to the LORD. 

 

11Even a child is known by his 
doings, 

Whether his work be pure, and 
whether it be right. 

 

12The hearing ear, and the seeing 
eye, 

The LORD hath made even both of 
them. 

 

13Love not sleep, lest thou come to 
poverty; 

Open thine eyes, and thou shalt have 
bread in plenty. 

 

14’It is bad, it is bad’, saith the 
buyer; 

But when he is gone his way, then 
he boasteth. 

 

15There is gold, and a multitude of 
rubies; 

But the lips of knowledge are a 
precious jewel. 

 

16Take his garment that is surety for 
a stranger; 

And hold him in pledge that is 
surety for an alien woman. 

 

17Bread of falsehood is sweet to a 
man; 

But afterwards his mouth shall be 
filled with gravel. 

 

18Every purpose is established by 
counsel; 

And with good advice carry on war. 

 

19He that goeth about as a talebearer 
revealeth secrets; 

Therefore meddle not with him that 
openeth wide his lips. 

 

20Whoso curseth his father or his 
mother, 

His lamp shall be put out in the 
blackest darkness. 

 

21An estate may be gotten hastily at 
the beginning; 

But the end thereof shall not be 
blessed. 

 

22Say not thou: ‘I will requite evil’; 


Wait for the LORD, and He will save 
thee. 

 

23Divers weights are an abomination 
to the LORD; 

And a false balance is not good. 

 

24A man’s goings are of the LORD; 

How then can man look to his way? 

 

25It is a snare to a man rashly to say: 
‘Holy’, 

And after vows to make inquiry. 

 

26A wise king sifteth the wicked, 

And turneth the wheel over them. 

 

27The spirit of man is the lamp of 
the LORD, 

Searching all the inward parts. 

 

28Mercy and truth preserve the king; 

And his throne is upheld by mercy. 

 

29The glory of young men is their 
strength; 

And the beauty of old men is the 
hoary head. 

 

30Sharp wounds cleanse away evil; 

So do stripes that reach the inward 
parts. 

 

The king’s heart is in the hand 
of the LORD, as the 
watercourses: 

He turneth it whithersoever He will. 

 

2Every way of a man is right in his 
own eyes; 

But the LORD weigheth the hearts. 

 

3To do righteousness and justice 

Is more acceptable to the LORD than 
sacrifice. 

 

4A haughty look, and a proud 
heart— 

The tillage of the wicked is sin. 

 

5The thoughts of the diligent tend 
only to plenteousness; 

But every one that is hasty hasteth 
only to want. 

 

6The getting of treasures by a lying 
tongue 

Is a vapour driven to and fro; they 
[that seek them] seek death. 

 

7The violence of the wicked shall 
drag them away; 

Because they refuse to do justly. 

 

8The way of man is froward and 
strange; 

But as for the pure, his work is right. 

 

9It is better to dwell in a corner of 
the housetop, 

Than in a house in common with a 
contentious woman. 

 

10The soul of the wicked desireth 
evil; 

His neighbour findeth no favour in 
his eyes. 
21 




 

11When the scorner is punished, the 
thoughtless is made wise; 

And when the wise is instructed, he 
receiveth knowledge. 

 

12The Righteous One considereth 
the house of the wicked; 

Overthrowing the wicked to their 
ruin. 

 

13Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry 
of the poor, 

He also shall cry himself, but shall 
not be answered. 

 

14A gift in secret pacifieth anger, 

And a present in the bosom strong 
wrath. 

 

15To do justly is joy to the righteous, 

But ruin to the workers of iniquity. 

 

16The man that strayeth out of the 
way of understanding 

Shall rest in the congregation of the 
shades. 

 

17He that loveth pleasure shall be a 
poor man; 

He that loveth wine and oil shall not 
be rich. 

 

18The wicked is a ransom for the 
righteous; 

And the faithless cometh in the 
stead of the upright. 

 

19It is better to dwell in a desert 
land, 

Than with a contentious and fretful 
woman. 

 

20There is desirable treasure and oil 
in the dwelling of the wise; 

But a foolish man swalloweth it up. 

 

21He that followeth after 
righteousness and mercy 

Findeth life, prosperity, and honour. 

 

22A wise man scaleth the city of the 
mighty, 

And bringeth down the stronghold 
wherein it trusteth. 

 

23Whoso keepeth his mouth and his 
tongue 

Keepeth his soul from troubles. 

 

24A proud and haughty man, scorner 
is his name, 

Even he that dealeth in overbearing 
pride. 

 

25The desire of the slothful killeth 
him; 

For his hands refuse to labour. 

 

26There is that coveteth greedily all 
the day long; 

But the righteous giveth and spareth 
not. 

 

27The sacrifice of the wicked is an 
abomination; 


How much more, when he bringeth 
it with the proceeds of 
wickedness? 

 

28A false witness shall perish; 

But the man that obeyeth shall speak 
unchallenged. 

 

29A wicked man hardeneth his face; 

But as for the upright, he looketh 
well to his way. 

 

30There is no wisdom nor 
understanding 

Nor counsel against the LORD. 

 

31The horse is prepared against the 
day of battle; 

But victory is of the LORD. 

 

A good name is rather to be 
chosen than great riches, 

And loving favour rather than silver 
and gold. 

 

2The rich and the poor meet 
together— 

The LORD is the maker of them all. 

 

3A prudent man seeth the evil, and 
hideth himself; 

But the thoughtless pass on, and are 
punished. 

 

4The reward of humility is the fear 
of the LORD, 

Even riches, and honour, and life. 

 

5Thorns and snares are in the way of 
the froward; 

He that keepeth his soul holdeth 
himself far from them. 

 

6Train up a child in the way he 
should go, 

And even when he is old, he will not 
depart from it. 

 

7The rich ruleth over the poor, 

And the borrower is servant to the 
lender. 

 

8He that soweth iniquity shall reap 
vanity; 

And the rod of his wrath shall fail. 

 

9He that hath a bountiful eye shall 
be blessed; 

For he giveth of his bread to the 
poor. 

 

10Cast out the scorner, and 
contention will go out; 

Yea, strife and shame will cease. 

 

11He that loveth pureness of heart, 

That hath grace in his lips, the king 
shall be his friend. 

 

12The eyes of the LORD preserve him 
that hath knowledge, 

But He overthroweth the words of 
the faithless man. 

 

13The sluggard saith: ‘There is a lion 
without; 

I shall be slain in the streets.’ 
22 




 

14The mouth of strange women is a 
deep pit: 

He that is abhorred of the LORD shall 
fall therein. 

 

15Foolishness is bound up in the 
heart of a child; 

But the rod of correction shall drive 
it far from him. 

 

16One may oppress the poor, yet will 
their gain increase; 

One may give to the rich, yet will 
want come. 

 

17Incline thine ear, and hear the 
words of the wise, 

And apply thy heart unto my 
knowledge. 

18For it is a pleasant thing if thou 
keep them within thee; 

Let them be established altogether 
upon thy lips. 

19That thy trust may be in the LORD, 

I have made them known to thee 
this day, even to thee. 

20Have not I written unto thee 
excellent things 

Of counsels and knowledge; 

21That I might make thee know the 
certainty of the words of truth, 

That thou mightest bring back 
words of truth to them that send 
thee? 

 

22Rob not the weak, because he is 
weak, 

Neither crush the poor in the gate; 

23For the LORD will plead their 
cause, 

And despoil of life those that 
despoil them. 

 

24Make no friendship with a man 
that is given to anger; 

And with a wrathful man thou shalt 
not go; 

25Lest thou learn his ways, 

And get a snare to thy soul. 

 

26Be thou not of them that strike 
hands, 

Or of them that are sureties for 
debts; 

27If thou hast not wherewith to pay, 

Why should he take away thy bed 
from under thee? 

 

28Remove not the ancient landmark, 

Which thy fathers have set. 

 

29Seest thou a man diligent in his 
business? he shall stand before 
kings; 

He shall not stand before mean men. 

 

When thou sittest to eat with a 
ruler, 

Consider well him that is before 
thee; 

2And put a knife to thy throat, 

If thou be a man given to appetite. 

3Be not desirous of his dainties; 

Seeing they are deceitful food. 

4Weary not thyself to be rich; 

Cease from thine own wisdom. 
23 




5Wilt thou set thine eyes upon it? it 
is gone; 

For riches certainly make 
themselves wings, 

Like an eagle that flieth toward 
heaven. 

 

6Eat thou not the bread of him that 
hath an evil eye, 

Neither desire thou his dainties; 

7For as one that hath reckoned 
within himself, so is he: 

‘Eat and drink’, saith he to thee; 

But his heart is not with thee. 

8The morsel which thou hast eaten 
shalt thou vomit up, 

And lose thy sweet words. 

 

9Speak not in the ears of a fool; 

For he will despise the wisdom of 
thy words. 

 

10Remove not the ancient landmark; 

And enter not into the fields of the 
fatherless; 

11For their Redeemer is strong; 

He will plead their cause with thee. 

 

12Apply thy heart unto instruction, 

And thine ears to the words of 
knowledge. 

 

13Withhold not correction from the 
child; 

For though thou beat him with the 
rod, he will not die. 

14Thou beatest him with the rod, 

And wilt deliver his soul from the 
nether-world. 

 

15My son, if thy heart be wise, 

My heart will be glad, even mine; 

16Yea, my reins will rejoice, 

When thy lips speak right things. 

 

17Let not thy heart envy sinners, 

But be in the fear of the LORD all the 
day; 

18For surely there is a future; 

And thy hope shall not be cut off. 

 

19Hear thou, my son, and be wise, 

And guide thy heart in the way. 

20Be not among winebibbers; 

Among gluttonous eaters of flesh; 

21For the drunkard and the glutton 
shall come to poverty; 

And drowsiness shall clothe a man 
with rags. 

 

22Hearken unto thy father that begot 
thee, 

And despise not thy mother when 
she is old. 

 

23Buy the truth, and sell it not; 

Also wisdom, and instruction, and 
understanding. 

24The father of the righteous will 
greatly rejoice; 

And he that begetteth a wise child 
will have joy of him. 

25Let thy father and thy mother be 
glad, 

And let her that bore thee rejoice. 

 

26My son, give me thy heart, 

And let thine eyes observe my ways. 


27For a harlot is a deep ditch; 

And an alien woman is a narrow pit. 

28She also lieth in wait as a robber, 

And increaseth the faithless among 
men. 

 

29Who crieth: ‘Woe’? who: ‘Alas’? 

Who hath contentions? who hath 
raving? 

Who hath wounds without cause? 

Who hath redness of eyes? 

30They that tarry long at the wine; 

They that go to try mixed wine. 

31Look not thou upon the wine when 
it is red, 

When it giveth its colour in the cup, 

When it glideth down smoothly; 

32At the last it biteth like a serpent, 

And stingeth like a basilisk. 

33Thine eyes shall behold strange 
things, 

And thy heart shall utter confused 
things. 

34Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth 
down in the midst of the sea, 

Or as he that lieth upon the top of a 
mast. 

35’They have struck me, and I felt it 
not, 

They have beaten me, and I knew it 
not; 

When shall I awake? I will seek it 
yet again.’ 

 

Be not thou envious of evil 
men, 

Neither desire to be with them. 

2For their heart studieth destruction, 

And their lips talk of mischief. 

 

3Through wisdom is a house 
builded; 

And by understanding it is 
established; 

4And by knowledge are the 
chambers filled 

With all precious and pleasant 
riches. 

 

5A wise man is strong; 

Yea, a man of knowledge increaseth 
strength. 

6For with wise advice thou shalt 
make thy war; 

And in the multitude of counsellors 
there is safety. 

 

7Wisdom is as unattainable to a fool 
as corals; 

He openeth not his mouth in the 
gate. 

 

8He that deviseth to do evil, 

Men shall call him a mischievous 
person. 

9The thought of foolishness is sin; 

And the scorner is an abomination 
to men. 

10If thou faint in the day of 
adversity, 

Thy strength is small indeed. 

11Deliver them that are drawn unto 
death; 

And those that are ready to be slain 
wilt thou forbear to rescue? 

12If thou sayest: ‘Behold, we knew 
not this’, 
24 




Doth not He that weigheth the hearts 
consider it? 

And He that keepeth thy soul, doth 
not He know it? 

And shall not He render to every 
man according to his works? 

 

13My son, eat thou honey, for it is 
good, 

And the honeycomb is sweet to thy 
taste; 

14So know thou wisdom to be unto 
thy soul; 

If thou hast found it, then shall there 
be a future, 

And thy hope shall not be cut off. 

 

15Lie not in wait, O wicked man, 
against the dwelling of the 
righteous, 

Spoil not his resting-place; 

16For a righteous man falleth seven 
times, and riseth up again, 

But the wicked stumble under 
adversity. 

 

17Rejoice not when thine enemy 
falleth, 

And let not thy heart be glad when 
he stumbleth; 

18Lest the LORD see it, and it 
displease Him, 

And He turn away His wrath from 
him. 

19Fret not thyself because of 
evildoers, 

Neither be thou envious at the 
wicked; 

20For there will be no future to the 
evil man, 

The lamp of the wicked shall be put 
out. 

 

21My son, fear thou the LORD and the 
king, 

And meddle not with them that are 
given to change; 

22For their calamity shall rise 
suddenly; 

And who knoweth the ruin from 
them both? 

 

23These also are sayings of the wise. 

 

To have respect of persons in 
judgment is not good. 

24He that saith unto the wicked: 
‘Thou art righteous’, 

Peoples shall curse him, nations 
shall execrate him; 

25But to them that decide justly shall 
be delight, 

And a good blessing shall come 
upon them. 

26He kisseth the lips 

That giveth a right answer. 

 

27Prepare thy work without, 

And make it fit for thyself in the 
field; 

And afterwards build thy house. 

 

28Be not a witness against thy 
neighbour without cause; 

And deceive not with thy lips. 

29Say not: ‘I will do so to him as he 
hath done to me; 


I will render to the man according to 
his work.’ 

 

 

30I went by the field of the slothful, 

And by the vineyard of the man 
void of understanding; 

31And, lo, it was all grown over with 
thistles, 

The face thereof was covered with 
nettles, 

And the stone wall thereof was 
broken down. 

32Then I beheld, and considered 
well; 

I saw, and received instruction. 

33’Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, 

A little folding of the hands to 
sleep’— 

34So shall thy poverty come as a 
runner, 

And thy want as an armed man. 

 

These also are proverbs of 
Solomon, which the men of 
Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. 

 

2It is the glory of God to conceal a 
thing; but the glory of kings is to 
search out a matter. 

3The heaven for height, and the 
earth for depth, and the heart of 
kings is unsearchable. 

 

4Take away the dross from the 
silver, and there cometh forth a 
vessel for the refiner; 

5Take away the wicked from before 
the king, and his throne shall be 
established in righteousness. 

 

6Glorify not thyself in the presence 
of the king, and stand not in the 
place of great men; 

7For better is it that it be said unto 
thee: ‘Come up hither’, than that 
thou shouldest be put lower in the 
presence of the prince, whom 
thine eyes have seen. 

 

8Go not forth hastily to strive, lest 
thou know not what to do in the 
end thereof, when thy neighbour 
hath put thee to shame. 

9Debate thy cause with thy 
neighbour, but reveal not the 
secret of another; 

10Lest he that heareth it revile thee, 
and thine infamy turn not away. 

 

11A word fitly spoken 

Is like apples of gold in settings of 
silver. 

 

12As an ear-ring of gold, and an 
ornament of fine gold, 

So is a wise reprover upon an 
obedient ear. 

 

13As the cold of snow in the time of 
harvest, 

So is a faithful messenger to him 
that sendeth him; 

For he refresheth the soul of his 
master. 

 
25 




14As vapours and wind without rain, 

So is he that boasteth himself of a 
false gift. 

 

15By long forbearing is a ruler 
persuaded, 

And a soft tongue breaketh the 
bone. 

 

16Hast thou found honey? eat so 
much as is sufficient for thee, 

Lest thou be filled therewith, and 
vomit it. 

 

17Let thy foot be seldom in thy 
neighbour’s house; 

Lest he be sated with thee, and hate 
thee. 

 

18As a maul, and a sword, and a 
sharp arrow, 

So is a man that beareth false 
witness against his neighbour. 

 

19Confidence in an unfaithful man in 
time of trouble 

Is like a broken tooth, and a foot out 
of joint. 

 

20As one that taketh off a garment in 
cold weather, and as vinegar upon 
nitre, 

So is he that singeth songs to a 
heavy heart. 

 

21If thine enemy be hungry, give 
him bread to eat, 

And if he be thirsty, give him water 
to drink; 

22For thou wilt heap coals of fire 
upon his head, 

And the LORD will reward thee. 

 

23The north wind bringeth forth rain, 

And a backbiting tongue an angry 
countenance. 

 

24It is better to dwell in a corner of 
the housetop, 

Than in a house in common with a 
contentious woman. 

 

25As cold waters to a faint soul, 

So is good news from a far country. 

 

26As a troubled fountain, and a 
corrupted spring, 

So is a righteous man that giveth 
way before the wicked. 

 

27It is not good to eat much honey; 

So for men to search out their own 
glory is not glory. 

 

28Like a city broken down and 
without a wall, 

So is he whose spirit is without 
restraint. 

 

As snow in summer, and as 
rain in harvest, 

So honour is not seemly for a fool. 

 

2As the wandering sparrow, as the 
flying swallow, 

So the curse that is causeless shall 
come home. 

 
26 




3A whip for the horse, a bridle for 
the ass, 

And a rod for the back of fools. 

 

4Answer not a fool according to his 
folly, 

Lest thou also be like unto him. 

 

5Answer a fool according to his 
folly, 

Lest he be wise in his own eyes. 

 

6He that sendeth a message by the 
hand of a fool 

Cutteth off his own feet, and 
drinketh damage. 

 

7The legs hang limp from the lame; 

So is a parable in the mouth of 
fools. 

 

8As a small stone in a heap of 
stones, 

So is he that giveth honour to a fool. 

 

9As a thorn that cometh into the 
hand of a drunkard, 

So is a parable in the mouth of 
fools. 

 

10A master performeth all things; 

But he that stoppeth a fool is as one 
that stoppeth a flood. 

 

11As a dog that returneth to his 
vomit, 

So is a fool that repeateth his folly. 

 

12Seest thou a man wise in his own 
eyes? 

There is more hope of a fool than of 
him. 

 

13The sluggard saith: ‘There is a lion 
in the way; 

Yea, a lion is in the streets.’ 

 

14The door is turning upon its 
hinges, 

And the sluggard is still upon his 
bed. 

 

15The sluggard burieth his hand in 
the dish; 

It wearieth him to bring it back to 
his mouth. 

 

16The sluggard is wiser in his own 
eyes 

Than seven men that give wise 
answer. 

 

17He that passeth by, and meddleth 
with strife not his own, 

Is like one that taketh a dog by the 
ears. 

 

18As a madman who casteth 
firebrands, 

Arrows, and death; 

19So is the man that deceiveth his 
neighbour, 

And saith: ‘Am not I in sport?’ 

 

20Where no wood is, the fire goeth 
out; 


And where there is no whisperer, 
contention ceaseth. 

 

21As coals are to burning coals, and 
wood to fire; 

So is a contentious man to kindle 
strife. 

 

22The words of a whisperer are as 
dainty morsels, 

And they go down into the 
innermost parts of the body. 

 

23Burning lips and a wicked heart 

Are like an earthen vessel overlaid 
with silver dross. 

 

24He that hateth dissembleth with his 
lips, 

But he layeth up deceit within him. 

25When he speaketh fair, 

Believe him not; 

For there are seven abominations in 
his heart. 

26Though his hatred be concealed 
with deceit, 

His wickedness shall be revealed 
before the congregation. 

 

27Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall 
therein; 

And he that rolleth a stone, it shall 
return upon him. 

 

28A lying tongue hateth those that 
are crushed by it; 

And a flattering mouth worketh 
ruin. 

 

Boast not thyself of to- 
morrow; 

For thou knowest not what a day 
may bring forth. 

 

2Let another man praise thee, and 
not thine own mouth; 

A stranger, and not thine own lips. 

 

3A stone is heavy, and the sand 
weighty; 

But a fool’s vexation is heavier than 
they both. 

 

4Wrath is cruel, and anger is 
overwhelming; 

But who is able to stand before 
jealousy? 

 

5Better is open rebuke 

Than love that is hidden. 

 

6Faithful are the wounds of a friend; 

But the kisses of an enemy are 
importunate. 

 

7The full soul loatheth a 
honeycomb; 

But to the hungry soul every bitter 
thing is sweet. 

 

8As a bird that wandereth from her 
nest, 

So is a man that wandereth from his 
place. 

 

9Ointment and perfume rejoice the 
heart; 
27 




So doth the sweetness of a man’s 
friend by hearty counsel. 

 

10Thine own friend, and thy father’s 
friend, forsake not; 

Neither go into thy brother’s house 
in the day of thy calamity; 

Better is a neighbour that is near 
than a brother far off. 

 

11My son, be wise, and make my 
heart glad, 

That I may answer him that taunteth 
me. 

 

12A prudent man seeth the evil, and 
hideth himself; 

But the thoughtless pass on, and are 
punished. 

 

13Take his garment that is surety for 
a stranger; 

And hold him in pledge that is 
surety for an alien woman. 

 

14He that blesseth his friend with a 
loud voice, rising early in the 
morning, 

It shall be counted a curse to him. 

 

15A continual dropping in a very 
rainy day 

And a contentious woman are alike; 

16He that would hide her hideth the 
wind, 

And the ointment of his right hand 
betrayeth itself. 

 

17Iron sharpeneth iron; 

So a man sharpeneth the 
countenance of his friend. 

 

18Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall 
eat the fruit thereof; 

And he that waiteth on his master 
shall be honoured. 

 

19As in water face answereth to face, 

So the heart of man to man. 

 

20The nether-world and Destruction 
are never satiated; 

So the eyes of man are never 
satiated. 

 

21The refining pot is for silver, and 
the furnace for gold, 

And a man is tried by his praise. 

 

22Though thou shouldest bray a fool 
in a mortar with a pestle among 
groats, 

Yet will not his foolishness depart 
from him. 

 

23Be thou diligent to know the state 
of thy flocks, 

And look well to thy herds; 

24For riches are not for ever; 

And doth the crown endure unto all 
generations? 

25When the hay is mown, and the 
tender grass showeth itself, 

And the herbs of the mountains are 
gathered in; 

26The lambs will be for thy clothing, 

And the goats the price for a field. 


27And there will be goats’milk 
enough for thy food, for the food 
of thy household; 

And maintenance for thy maidens. 

 

The wicked flee when no man 
pursueth; 

But the righteous are secure as a 
young lion. 

 

2For the transgression of a land 
many are the princes thereof; 

But by a man of understanding and 
knowledge established order shall 
long continue. 

 

3A poor man that oppresseth the 
weak 

Is like a sweeping rain which 
leaveth no food. 

 

4They that forsake the law praise the 
wicked; 

But such as keep the law contend 
with them. 

 

5Evil men understand not justice; 

But they that seek the LORD 
understand all things. 

 

6Better is the poor that walketh in 
his integrity, 

Than he that is perverse in his ways, 
though he be rich. 

 

7A wise son observeth the teaching; 
ut he that is a companion of 
gluttonous men shameth his 
father. 

 

8He that augmenteth his substance 
by interest and increase, 

Gathereth it for him that is gracious 
to the poor. 

 

9He that turneth away his ear from 
hearing the law, 

Even his prayer is an abomination. 

 

10Whoso causeth the upright to go 
astray in an evil way, 

He shall fall himself into his own 
pit; 

But the whole-hearted shall inherit 
good. 

 

11The rich man is wise in his own 
eyes; 

But the poor that hath understanding 
searcheth him through. 

 

12When the righteous exult, there is 
great glory; 

But when the wicked rise, men must 
be sought for. 

 

13He that covereth his transgressions 
shall not prosper; 

But whoso confesseth and forsaketh 
them shall obtain mercy. 

 

14Happy is the man that feareth 
alway; 

But he that hardeneth his heart shall 
fall into evil. 

 

15As a roaring lion, and a ravenous 
bear; 
28 




So is a wicked ruler over a poor 
people. 

 

16The prince that lacketh 
understanding is also a great 
oppressor; 

But he that hateth covetousness 
shall prolong his days. 

 

17A man that is laden with the blood 
of any person 

Shall hasten his steps unto the pit; 
none will support him. 

 

18Whoso walketh uprightly shall be 
saved; 

But he that is perverse in his ways 
shall fall at once. 

 

19He that tilleth his ground shall 
have plenty of bread; 

But he that followeth after vain 
things shall have poverty enough. 

 

20A faithful man shall abound with 
blessings; 

But he that maketh haste to be rich 
shall not be unpunished. 

 

21To have respect of persons is not 
good; 

For a man will transgress for a piece 
of bread. 

 

22He that hath an evil eye hasteneth 
after riches, 

And knoweth not that want shall 
come upon him. 

 

23He that rebuketh a man shall in the 
end find more favour 

Than he that flattereth with the 
tongue. 

 

24Whoso robbeth his father or his 
mother, and saith: ‘It is no 
transgression’, 

The same is the companion of a 
destroyer. 

 

25He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth 
up strife; 

But he that putteth his trust in the 
LORD shall be abundantly 
gratified. 

 

26He that trusteth in his own heart is 
a fool; 

But whoso walketh wisely, he shall 
escape. 

 

27He that giveth unto the poor shall 
not lack; 

But he that hideth his eyes shall 
have many a curse. 

 

28When the wicked rise, men hide 
themselves; 

But when they perish, the righteous 
increase. 

 

He that being often reproved 
hardeneth his neck 

Shall suddenly be broken, and that 
without remedy. 

 

2When the righteous are increased, 
the people rejoice; 
29 




But when the wicked beareth rule, 
the people sigh. 

 

3Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his 
father; 

But he that keepeth company with 
harlots wasteth his substance. 

 

4The king by justice establisheth the 
land; 

But he that exacteth gifts 
overthroweth it. 

 

5A man that flattereth his neighbour 

Spreadeth a net for his steps. 

 

6In the transgression of an evil man 
there is a snare; 

But the righteous doth sing and 
rejoice. 

 

7The righteous taketh knowledge of 
the cause of the poor; 

The wicked understandeth not 
knowledge. 

 

8Scornful men set a city in a blaze; 

But wise men turn away wrath. 

 

9If a wise man contendeth with a 
foolish man, 

Whether he be angry or laugh, there 
will be no rest. 

 

10The men of blood hate him that is 
sincere; 

And as for the upright, they seek his 
life. 

 

11A fool spendeth all his spirit; 

But a wise man stilleth it within 
him. 

 

12If a ruler hearkeneth to falsehood, 

All his servants are wicked. 

 

13The poor man and the oppressor 
meet together; 

The LORD giveth light to the eyes of 
them both. 

 

14The king that faithfully judgeth the 
poor, 

His throne shall be established for 
ever. 

 

15The rod and reproof give wisdom; 

But a child left to himself causeth 
shame to his mother. 

 

16When the wicked are increased, 
transgression increaseth; 

But the righteous shall gaze upon 
their fall. 

 

17Correct thy son, and he will give 
thee rest; 

Yea, he will give delight unto thy 
soul. 

 

18Where there is no vision, the 
people cast off restraint; 

But he that keepeth the law, happy 
is he. 

 

19A servant will not be corrected by 
words; 


For though he understand, there will 
be no response. 

 

20Seest thou a man that is hasty in 
his words? 

There is more hope for a fool than 
for him. 

 

21He that delicately bringeth up his 
servant from a child 

Shall have him become master at the 
last. 

 

22An angry man stirreth up strife, 

And a wrathful man aboundeth in 
transgression. 

 

23A man’s pride shall bring him low; 

But he that is of a lowly spirit shall 
attain to honour. 

 

24Whoso is partner with a thief 
hateth his own soul: 

He heareth the adjuration and 
uttereth nothing. 

 

25The fear of man bringeth a snare; 

But whoso putteth his trust in the 
LORD shall be set up on high. 

 

26Many seek the ruler’s favour; 

But a man’s judgment cometh from 
the LORD. 

 

27An unjust man is an abomination 
to the righteous; 

And he that is upright in the way is 
an abomination to the wicked. 

 

The words of Agur the son of 
Jakeh; the burden. 

 

The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel 
and Ucal: 

2Surely I am brutish, unlike a man, 

And have not the understanding of a 
man; 

3And I have not learned wisdom, 

That I should have the knowledge of 
the Holy One. 

4Who hath ascended up into heaven, 
and descended? 

Who hath gathered the wind in his 
fists? 

Who hath bound the waters in his 
garment? 

Who hath established all the ends of 
the earth? 

What is his name, and what is his 
son’s name, if thou knowest? 

 

5Every word of God is tried; 

He is a shield unto them that take 
refuge in Him. 

6Add thou not unto His words, 

Lest He reprove thee, and thou be 
found a liar. 

 

7Two things have I asked of Thee; 

Deny me them not before I die: 

8Remove far from me falsehood and 
lies; 

Give me neither poverty nor riches; 
feed me with mine allotted bread; 

9Lest I be full, and deny, and say: 
‘Who is the LORD?’ 

Or lest I be poor, and steal, 

And profane the name of my God. 
30 




 

10Slander not a servant unto his 
master, 

Lest he curse thee, and thou be 
found guilty. 

 

11There is a generation that curse 
their father, 

And do not bless their mother. 

12There is a generation that are pure 
in their own eyes, 

And yet are not washed from their 
filthiness. 

13There is a generation, Oh how 
lofty are their eyes! 

And their eyelids are lifted up. 

14There is a generation whose teeth 
are as swords, and their great 
teeth as knives, 

To devour the poor from off the 
earth, and the needy from among 
men. 

 

15The horseleech hath two 
daughters: ‘Give, give.’ 

There are three things that are never 
satisfied, 

Yea, four that say not: ‘Enough’: 

16The grave; and the barren womb; 

The earth that is not satisfied with 
water; 

And the fire that saith not: 
‘Enough.’ 

 

17The eye that mocketh at his father, 

And despiseth to obey his mother, 

The ravens of the valley shall pick it 
out, 

And the young vultures shall eat it. 

 

18There are three things which are 
too wonderful for me, 

Yea, four which I know not: 

19The way of an eagle in the air; 

The way of a serpent upon a rock; 

The way of a ship in the midst of the 
sea; 

And the way of a man with a young 
woman. 

20So is the way of an adulterous 
woman; 

She eateth, and wipeth her mouth, 

And saith: ‘I have done no 
wickedness.’ 

 

21For three things the earth doth 
quake, 

And for four it cannot endure: 

22For a servant when he reigneth; 

And a churl when he is filled with 
food; 

23For an odious woman when she is 
married; 

And a handmaid that is heir to her 
mistress. 

 

24There are four things which are 
little upon the earth, 

But they are exceeding wise: 

25The ants are a people not strong, 

Yet they provide their food in the 
summer; 

26The rock-badgers are but a feeble 
folk, 

Yet make they their houses in the 
crags; 

27The locusts have no king, 


Yet go they forth all of them by 
bands; 

28The spider thou canst take with the 
hands, 

Yet is she in kings’palaces. 

 

29There are three things which are 
stately in their march, 

Yea, four which are stately in going: 

30The lion, which is mightiest 
among beasts, 

And turneth not away for any; 

31The greyhound; the he-goat also; 

And the king, against whom there is 
no rising up. 

 

32If thou hast done foolishly in 
lifting up thyself, 

Or if thou hast planned devices, lay 
thy hand upon thy mouth. 

33For the churning of milk bringeth 
forth curd, 

And the wringing of the nose 
bringeth forth blood; 

So the forcing of wrath bringeth 
forth strife. 

 

31 



The words of king Lemuel; the 
burden wherewith his mother 
corrected him. 

 

2What, my son? and what, O son of 
my womb? 

And what, O son of my vows? 

3Give not thy strength unto women, 

Nor thy ways to that which 
destroyeth kings. 

4It is not for kings, O aLemuel, it is 
not for kings to drink wine: 

a Heb. Lemoel. 

Nor for princes to say: ‘Where is 
strong drink?’ 

5Lest they drink, and forget that 
which is decreed, 

And pervert the justice due to any 
that is afflicted. 

6Give strong drink unto him that is 
ready to perish, 

And wine unto the bitter in soul; 

7Let him drink, and forget his 
poverty, 

And remember his misery no more. 

8Open thy mouth for the dumb, 

In the cause of all such as are 
appointed to destruction. 

9Open thy mouth, judge righteously, 

And plead the cause of the poor and 
needy. 

 

. 10A woman of valour who can find? 

 For her price is far above rubies. 

. 11The heart of her husband doth 
aafely trust in her, 

 And he hath no lack of gain. 

. 12She doeth him good and not evil 

 All the days of her life. 

. 13She seeketh wool and flax, 

 And worketh willingly with her 
hands. 

. 14She is like the merchant-ships; She 
bringeth her food from afar. 

. 15She riseth also while it is yet 
night, 


 And giveth food to her household, 
And a portion to her maidens. 

. 16She considereth a field, and 
buyeth it; 

 With the fruit of her hands she 
planteth a vineyard. 

. 17She girdeth her loins with 
strength, 

 And maketh strong her arms. 

. 18She perceiveth that her 
merchandise is good; 

 Her lamp goeth not out by night. 

. 19She layeth her hands to the distaff, 

 And her hands hold the spindle. 

. 20She stretcheth out her hand to the 
poor; 

 Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to 
the needy. 

. 21She is not afraid of the snow for 
her household; 

 For all her household are clothed 
with scarlet. 

. 22She maketh for herself coverlets; 

 Her clothing is fine linen and 
purple. 

. 23Her husband is known in the 
gates, 

 When he sitteth among the elders of 
the land. 

. 24She maketh linen garments and 
selleth them; 

 And delivereth girdles unto the 
merchant. 

. 25Strength and dignity are her 
clothing; 

 And she laugheth at the time to 
come. 

. 26She openeth her mouth with 
wisdom; 

 And the law of kindness is on her 
tongue. 

. 27She looketh well to the ways of 
her household, 

 And eateth not the bread of 
idleness. 

. 28Her children rise up, and call her 
blessed; 

 Her husband also, and he praiseth 
her: 

. 29’Many daughters have done 
valiantly, 

 But thou excellest them all.’ 

. 30Grace is deceitful, and beauty is 
vain; 

 But a woman that feareth the LORD, 
she shall be praised. 

. 31Give her of the fruit of her hands; 

 And let her works praise her in the 
gates.
