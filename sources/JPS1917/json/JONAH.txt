            "And they said every one to his fellow: \u2018Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.\u2019 So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.", 
            "Then said they unto him: \u2018Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us: what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?\u2019",
