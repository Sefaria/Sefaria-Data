<title>FOREWORD</title>
<p>Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentary on the Book of Numbers follows the pattern established in his commentaries on the first three books of the Pentateuch. It is marked by fidelity to the plain meaning of the text, an application of philosophical and scientific beliefs in elucidating texts, independence of interpretation when <italic>halakhah</italic> is not involved, and a strict respect for rabbinic tradition when <italic>halakhah</italic> is involved.</p>
<p>I.E.&#x2019;s dedication to both the literal meaning of the text and his philosophical views can be seen in his interpretation of the law of the Nazirite. Numbers 6:2-5 states: <italic>When either man or woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to consecrate himself to the Lord, he shall abstain from wine and strong drink&#x2026;All the days of his vow of Naziriteship there shall no razor come upon his head; until the days be fulfilled, in which he consecrated himself unto the Lord, he shall be holy, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long</italic>.</p>
<p>Some sages of the Talmud took a dim view of the Nazirite. &#x201C;Eleazar ha-Kappar Berabbi says: What is Scripture referring to when it says [of the Nazirite], <italic>and make atonement for him, for he sinned by reason of the soul</italic> (Num. 6:11). Against which soul did he sin? [It must refer to the fact that] he denied himself wine. We can now make this inference from minor to major: If the Nazirite who denied himself wine only is called a sinner, <italic>a fortiori</italic> one who denies himself the enjoyment of many other things (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic> 11a).&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra disagrees. He insists on taking Scripture at face value. There is nothing in the Torah and the prophets which implies that the Torah does not fully endorse Naziriteship. First of all, the Torah lays down the law of the Nazirite. Second, Scripture refers to the Nazirite as a holy person. Furthermore, the prophet Amos declares: <italic>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites</italic> (Amos 2:11). The prophet Jeremiah had only praise for the Rechabites who abstained from wine (Jer. 35:14-19).</p>
<p>Thus the notion that the Nazirite is a sinner seems to run counter to the literal meaning of Scripture. Indeed, I.E. considers Eleazar ha-Kappar Berabbi&#x2019;s proof from Num. 6:11 that the Nazirite is a sinner purely midrashic and contrary to the literal meaning of the text.</p>
<p>Aside from the literal meaning of the text, I.E. had a philosophical reason for rejecting the opinion that the Nazirite is a sinner. According to I.E. the way for a person to develop his soul is to separate himself from the pleasures of this world and dedicate himself solely to God. &#x201C;The intelligent man will not occupy himself with the vanities of the world. On the contrary, he will isolate himself for the purpose of studying and mediating upon God&#x2019;s law and observing the Lord&#x2019;s precepts. God will then open the eyes of his heart and will create a new and different spirit in him. He will be beloved of his creator while yet alive. His soul will cleave to God and enjoy the fullness of the joy of God&#x2019;s presence. Furthermore, God&#x2019;s right hand of bliss will be eternally upon his soul when it separates from the body&#x201D; (Ibn Ezra, <italic>Yesod Mora</italic>, translated by H. Norman Strickman, p. 107).</p>
<p>According to I.E. sex is one of the things that creates a barrier between man and God (<italic>Yesod Mora</italic>, chapter 7, pp. 107 and 108). The Nazirite is an individual who takes a vow to abstain from wine and haircutting. I.E. connects wine and hair to sexuality. He believes that most sexual taboos are violated because the transgressor has imbibed wine. As to the prohibition of cutting the hair, I.E. writes, &#x201C;A woman who does not fix her hair does not seek to engage in sexual relationships&#x201D; (Num. 5:31). He similarly notes that the Torah states that &#x201C;a razor shall not come upon the head of a Nazirite so that he does not make himself attractive to women.&#x201D; (<italic>Yesod Mora</italic>, p. 62).</p>
<p>I.E. believed the Nazirite to be a prince of men. He writes: &#x201C;All men are slaves of the lusts of the world. The true king, the one who has the diadem and the crown of kingship over his head is the one who is free of lust&#x201D; (Num. 6:7). &#x201C;The Nazirite is a holy person. When the Nazirite completes his term and wants to go back to drinking wine, he must bring a burnt offering, a sin offering, and a peace offering. He must also shave his head at the entrance of the tent of meeting. He is treated disrespectfully because he is distancing himself from his holiness and is descending in state (<italic>Yesod Mora</italic>, p. 145).&#x201D;</p>
<p>I.E.&#x2019;s approach to sex is seen in his acceptance of the aggadic interpretation regarding the enigmatic incident of Moses&#x2019; relation to a Cushite women. The Torah tells us (Num. 12:1,2): <italic>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman. And they said: Hath the Lord indeed spoken only with Moses? hath he not spoken also with us?</italic></p>
<p>The rabbis explain that Moses ceased having relations with Zipporah, for he was constantly in contact with God. Zipporah complained about this, and Miriam and Aaron supported her. They argued that they too were prophets, and they did not refrain from having sexual relations (<italic>Sifre</italic> 99). I.E. accepted this aggadic interpretation because it fit with his philosophical ideology.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s rendering of the word <italic>selach</italic>, which is usually translated as forgive, is unique. According to I.E. the meaning of <italic>selach</italic> is to postpone punishment. I.E. bases his interpretation on the punishment meted out to the Israelites for accepting the words of the spies sent to Canaan, i.e., that they would be unable to conquer the land. Scripture tells us that God wanted to destroy Israel for their lack of faith. However, when Moses prayed on behalf of Israel, God told Moses, <italic>salachti ke-devarekha</italic> (I have pardoned according to thy word) (Num. 14:20). God then goes on to say that since Israel did not hearken to His voice they shall not come into the land, and their children shall be wanderers in the desert for forty years until they (the original sinners) have all died (Num. 14:22,3). We thus see that Israel was ultimately punished for their lack of faith in God, even though God had told Moses, <italic>salachti ke-devarekha</italic>. I.E. thus concluded that the term <italic>selach</italic> refers to a postponement of punishment.</p>
<p>According to the Torah, Moses sinned at Meribah by failing to sanctify God in the eyes of the children of Israel (Num. 20:12). According to I.E., Moses&#x2019; sin was in being distracted by the people from properly directing his heart to God. As a result Moses was initially unable to bring water from the rock and God&#x2019;s name was desecrated.</p>
<p>I.E. uses astrology to explain the ability of Balaam to utter efficacious blessings and curses. According to I.E., Balaam was no true prophet. He was an astrologer who carefully tailored his words to what was written in the stars. He thus appeared to have the power to bless and curse.</p>
<p>According to I.E. the Biblical narratives do not necessarily follow in chronological order. He thus places Korah&#x2019;s rebellion (Num. 16) in the first year of Israel&#x2019;s sojourn in the desert, not in the fortieth year as implied by its position in Scripture.</p>
<p>While I.E. maintains an independent position regarding Biblical interpretations, he always defers to the sages of the Talmud on <italic>halakhic</italic> issues. Thus in regard to the law concerning fringes, I.E. notes it is possible that Biblical rules require that the corners of garments be left unwoven so that their threads hang down to form fringes. He further notes that the law of fringes applies to pants. However, he then goes on to say that this interpretation is of no consequence, for the rabbis say that the fringes are specially prepared threads which are placed on the corner of any garment having four corners. Therefore pants are not included in the law of fringes.</p>
<p>Although I.E.&#x2019;s commentary is distinguished by independence and by occasional bold theological statements, his commentary is also marked by a nonrationalistic bent. Thus in dealing with the copper serpent made by Moses to heal anyone bitten by poisonous snakes (Num. 21:8), I.E. takes issue with those who tried to explain this miracle rationally. He argues that God&#x2019;s powers are beyond explanation.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentary on the Book of Numbers thus reflects a confluence of the literal and the scientific, the traditional and the interpretive, the theological and the philosophical. His style of Biblical exegesis is unique and always thought-provoking and rewarding.</p>

<title>CHAPTER 1</title>
<h1>BA-MIDBAR</h1>
<p align="blockquote">In the name of God who counted those numbered above<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> and below;<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">I begin to explain according to the plain meaning</p>
<p align="blockquote">the Torah portion which begins with <italic>va-yedabber</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>1. IN THE WILDERNESS. This verse<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> informs us that Moses did not go up to Mount Sinai<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> since God&#x2019;s glory was now present in the tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE SECOND MONTH. To tell him to arrange the standards and to instruct him how the Israelites were to journey and how they were to camp with reference to the tabernacle,<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> for they journeyed on the twentieth day of the second month.<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. TAKE YE THE SUM. <italic>Se&#x2019;u et rosh bene yisra&#x2019;el</italic> (take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel) is similar to <italic>ki tissa et rosh bene yisra&#x2019;el</italic> (when thou takest the sum of the children of Israel) (Ex. 30:12). I have explained its meaning there.<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>BY THEIR FAMILIES BY THEIR FATHER&#x2019;S HOUSES. For pedigree is not determined by the mother.<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>BY THEIR POLLS. I have already explained the meaning of <italic>gulgelotam</italic> (their polls).<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. IN ISRAEL. This excludes the mixed multitude.<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. EVERY ONE HEAD OF HIS FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSE. <italic>Ish rosh le-vet avotav</italic> (every one head of his fathers&#x2019; house) is an abridged phrase. The text should have read, <italic>ish ish rosh le-vet avotav</italic> (every one head of his fathers&#x2019; house).<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. OF REUBEN. Scripture begins with Jacob&#x2019;s first-born,<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>yet not so that he was to be reckoned in the genealogy as first-born</italic> (I Chron. 5:1).<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. OF THE CHILDREN OF JOSEPH. The children of Joseph are mentioned after the children of Leah because Rachel&#x2019;s status was greater than that of the handmaids.<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> Scripture begins with Ephraim, in keeping with the actions of our father Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> Scripture places Ephraim and Manasseh<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> before Benjamin because they are in place of Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture then begins with Dan,<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> who was the first-born of the handmaids.<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> Asher follows Dan<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> because God knew that Asher would be the head of those who camp under the standard of Dan.<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> Scripture then mentions Gad because he was the first-born of Leah&#x2019;s handmaid.<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THESE WERE THE ELECT OF THE CONGREGATION. The meaning of <italic>keru&#x2019;e ha-edah</italic> (the elect of the congregation)<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> is that the congregation does nothing unless they are called.</p>
<p>THE TRIBES OF THEIR FATHERS. The meaning of <italic>mattot avotam</italic> is the tribes of their fathers. Thus each one<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> was prince of a tribe.</p>
<p>THEY WERE THE HEADS OF THE THOUSANDS OF ISRAEL. Each one was a leader over all the thousands that comprised a tribe, for there was also a chief over one thousand.<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND MOSES AND AARON TOOK. With them.</p>
<p>THAT ARE POINTED OUT BY NAME. <italic>Nikkevu</italic> means that are pointed out. Compare, <italic>yikkvennu</italic> (mark out) in <italic>Which the mouth of the Lord shall mark out</italic> (Is. 62:2).</p>
<p>18. AND THEY DECLARED THEIR PEDIGREES. They were asked for their birth dates,<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> for only those from twenty and above were to be counted. Their progeny were then recorded.<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. SO DID HE NUMBER THEM. The reference is to Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> who was the most important.<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture begins<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> with Reuben,<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> as he was the first-born. Simeon is next<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> because he was born after Reuben. Gad the first-born of Leah&#x2019;s handmaid,<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> follows. We thus have Reuben&#x2019;s standard.<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup> Next<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup> comes the standard of Judah,<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup> followed by the standard of Ephraim<sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> and the standard of Dan.<sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup> Those who camped around each standard did so in the same manner in which they offered the sacrifices dedicating the altar.</p>
<p>Note, there were twelve tribes,<sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup> for Levi was not counted and Joseph&#x2019;s two sons were. Now the world has four sides.<sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup> Behold, three tribes camped on each one of the four sides.<sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Leah had five sons,<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> for one of her six sons<sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup> was not counted. She had two standards.<sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup> They [Moses and Aaron] completed one of her standards<sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup> with [Gad] the first-born of her handmaid.<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> They placed Gad with the standard of Reuben, who was also a first-born.</p>
<p>Judah made up the second standard [of Leah]. His younger brothers camped with him.<sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rachel had a standard of her own.<sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup> Ephraim was in place of Joseph. He preceded Manasseh, in keeping with the words of Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fourth standard was that of Rachel&#x2019;s handmaid. It was led by [Dan] her first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup> Asher followed<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup> even though he was younger than Naphtali.<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup> The son of Leah&#x2019;s handmaid<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup> was so honored because the standard belonged to Rachel&#x2019;s handmaid.<sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>If you look carefully into things, you will know that the south is the head and the north the tail.<sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup> I cannot explain the aforementioned.<sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup> Reuben was therefore placed in the south<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup> because he was the head.<sup><xref rid="fn60">60</xref></sup> Dan was placed in the north.<sup><xref rid="fn61">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observe, there was no one among the tribes comparable in might to Judah, who was compared to a lion&#x2019;s whelp (Gen. 49:9),<sup><xref rid="fn62">62</xref></sup> and to the tribe of Dan, who is likewise compared to a lion by Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup> These tribes were thus first and last.<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture mentions <italic>by their polls</italic> (le-gulgelotam) with regard to Reuben<sup><xref rid="fn65">65</xref></sup> and also with regard to Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn66">66</xref></sup> to show that it was the same case with the other tribes,<sup><xref rid="fn67">67</xref></sup> for Scripture was being brief.</p>
<p>45. [AND ALL THOSE THAT WERE NUMBERED OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BY THEIR FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSES, FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD.] It means that only those who were aged twenty and above were counted. Scripture then goes on to say,<sup><xref rid="fn68">68</xref></sup> <italic>even all those that were numbered</italic>. The latter refers to their<sup><xref rid="fn69">69</xref></sup> total number.<sup><xref rid="fn70">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>47. WERE NOT NUMBERED AMONG THEM. The word <italic>hotpakdu</italic> (were not numbered) is of two forms. It is both a <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic> and a <italic>hofal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn71">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>49. HOWBEIT THE TRIBE OF LEVI THOU SHALT NOT NUMBER. This explains <italic>were not numbered</italic> (v. 47),<sup><xref rid="fn72">72</xref></sup> that the Levites were not numbered because this is what God commanded.</p>
<p>NEITHER SHALT THOU TAKE THE SUM OF THEM. Their total number, as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>50. BUT APPOINT THOU THE LEVITES OVER THE TABERNACLE. Scripture explains here why the Levites were not counted. They were not counted because the charge of the tabernacle was upon them. Therefore they did not serve in the army.<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY. The reference is to the tent of meeting and the tabernacle of the ark, which contains the testimony.<sup><xref rid="fn75">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND OVER ALL THE FURNITURE<sup><xref rid="fn76">76</xref></sup> THEREOF. Such as the menorah, the table, and the altars.</p>
<p>AND OVER ALL THAT BELONGETH TO IT. The reference is the utensils which serve the furniture.<sup><xref rid="fn77">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY SHALL BEAR THE TABERNACLE. They are the very ones who carry the tabernacle when the camp journeys, and they are the ones who shall minister unto the tabernacle when they camp. They shall camp around the tabernacle.</p>
<p>51. AND WHEN THE TABERNACLE SETTETH FORWARD, THE LEVITES SHALL TAKE IT DOWN. They shall remove its bars and posts. When the tabernacle rests, they shall set it up.</p>
<p>AND THE COMMON MAN.<sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup> A person who is not a Levite, even if he is an Israelite.</p>
<p>SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH. A law court shall put him to death.</p>
<p>52. [AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL PITCH.] Its meaning is, &#x201C;when&#x201D; the children of Israel shall pitch.<sup><xref rid="fn79">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVERY MAN WITH HIS OWN CAMP. The meaning of every man is each tribe.<sup><xref rid="fn80">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND EVERY MAN WITH HIS OWN STANDARD.] Its meaning is that the tribe of one standard shall not be mixed with the tribe of another standard.</p>
<p>53. BUT THE LEVITES SHALL PITCH ROUND ABOUT THE TABERNACLE OF TESTIMONY. Our verse explains why the earlier verse<sup><xref rid="fn81">81</xref></sup> stated that the Levites were to encamp round about the tabernacle:<sup><xref rid="fn82">82</xref></sup> so that no one from the congregation of Israel should draw close to the tabernacle and die. This is the meaning of <italic>that there be no wrath upon&#x2026;the children of Israel</italic>, as there was in the case of Uzzah, who touched the ark. Scripture there states, <italic>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah</italic> (II Sam. 6:7).</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>upon the congregation of the children of Israel</italic> is, upon anyone from the children of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn83">83</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>and was buried in the cities of Gilead</italic><sup><xref rid="fn84">84</xref></sup> (Jud. 12:7)<sup><xref rid="fn85">85</xref></sup> and <italic>Even upon a colt the foal of asses</italic><sup><xref rid="fn86">86</xref></sup> (Zech. 9:9).<sup><xref rid="fn87">87</xref></sup> There are many such cases.</p>
<p>AND THE LEVITES SHALL KEEP THE CHARGE. The Levites are obligated to guard the tabernacle.</p>
<p>54. THUS DID THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. They never touched the tabernacle.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> The stars. See Ps. 147:4, <italic>He counteth the number of the stars</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> The Book of Numbers begins with the word <italic>va-yedabber</italic> (spoke).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> Which states that <italic>the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5"><sup>5</sup> For revelation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6"><sup>6</sup> Otherwise, what follows would have been told to Moses on Mount Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn7"><sup>7</sup> Filwarg suggests emending <italic>ba&#x2019;avur ha-mishkan</italic> (with reference to the tabernacle) to <italic>be&#x2019;evre ha-mishkan</italic> (on the sides of the tabernacle).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn8"><sup>8</sup> Hence it was necessary to inform Moses of these things prior to their journey.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn9"><sup>9</sup> See I.E. on Exodus, (Vol. 2, p. 631). I.E. explains that <italic>ki tissa et rosh</italic> literally means: when you lift up the head. One who takes a census writes the particulars after the sum, which he writes at the top of the page. Thus when Scripture speaks of raising up the head, it means take up the sum.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn10"><sup>10</sup> Hence Scripture qualified <italic>by their families</italic> with <italic>by their fathers&#x2019; houses</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn11"><sup>11</sup> The word <italic>gulgelotam</italic> (their polls) literally means their skulls. In his short commentary (S.C.) on Exodus, I.E. explains that the word <italic>gulgolet</italic> means a head. The head is so called because it is round. Compare, <italic>galgal</italic> (wheel, i.e., a round object). See I.E. on Ex. 16:16 (S.C.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn12"><sup>12</sup> Foreigners who joined Israel during the Exodus. See Ex. 12:38.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn13"><sup>13</sup> The first part of the verse reads, <italic>ish ish la-matteh</italic> (a man of every tribe). Hence, in keeping with the rules of parallelism, the second part of the verse should read, <italic>ish ish rosh le-vet avotav hu</italic>) (every one head of his father&#x2019;s house).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn14"><sup>14</sup> Even though Jacob took away Reuben&#x2019;s birthright. See Gen. 49:3,4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn15"><sup>15</sup> I Chronicles explains that even though Reuben lost his birthright to Joseph, he was always to be reckoned as the first-born as far as genealogy was concerned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn16"><sup>16</sup> Hence Rachel&#x2019;s descendants are mentioned before those of the handmaids even though the children of the handmaids precede them in birth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn17"><sup>17</sup> Manassah was older than Ephraim. However, Jacob placed Ephraim before Manasseh. See Gen. 48:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn18"><sup>18</sup> Joseph&#x2019;s sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn19"><sup>19</sup> Joseph was born before Benjamin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn20"><sup>20</sup> The son of Bilhah, Rachel&#x2019;s handmaid.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn21"><sup>21</sup> Of the children born to the handmaids&#x2019;. See Gen. 30:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn22"><sup>22</sup> Gad and Asher were the sons of Zilpah, Leah&#x2019;s handmaid. According to Gen. 30:10-13, Gad was Zilpah&#x2019;s first-born. Thus Scripture should have mentioned Gad before Asher. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn23"><sup>23</sup> Asher pitched next to Dan and was therefore next in importance under that standard. Gad was third under the standard of Reuben. See Num. 2:14,27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn24"><sup>24</sup> See Gen. 30:10,11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn25"><sup>25</sup> Literally, the called of the congregation. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn26"><sup>26</sup> Each one of those listed in verses 5-16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn27"><sup>27</sup> The tribes were divided into units of thousands. Each of these units was headed by a <italic>sar</italic> (chief). See Ex. 18:21, <italic>sarei alafim</italic> (rulers over thousands). Also see I Sam. 17:8, <italic>sar ha-elef</italic> (the captain of their thousand). Each one listed in verses 5-15 was the head of all the captains of the thousands of their respective tribes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn28"><sup>28</sup> The Biblical text reads, <italic>va-yityalledu</italic> (and they declared their pedigrees). I.E. translates this as: they gave their birth dates.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn29"><sup>29</sup> See verse 2. <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads, &#x201C;Or, their progeny were recorded.&#x201D; According to this interpretation, <italic>va-yityalledu</italic> means: and they declared their children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn30"><sup>30</sup> <italic>Va-yifkedem</italic> (so did he count them) is in the singular. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn31"><sup>31</sup> Actually Aaron and the heads of the tribes also participated in counting the people (see verse 44). However, Scripture here mentions only Moses, because he was the most important.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 2</title>
<p>1. [AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON.] Scripture reads, <italic>unto Moses and unto Aaron</italic><sup><xref rid="fn88">1</xref></sup> because Aaron and his sons were to command the Kohathites as to which burdens they were to carry upon their shoulders.<sup><xref rid="fn89">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. ACCORDING TO THE ENSIGNS. There were signs upon each and every standard.</p>
<p>The ancients<sup><xref rid="fn90">3</xref></sup> said that the banner of Reuben had the form of a person on it.<sup><xref rid="fn91">4</xref></sup> Their statement is based on a midrashic interpretation concerning the mandrakes found by Reuben.<sup><xref rid="fn92">5</xref></sup> The ancients also tell us that there was an image of a lion on the standard of Judah, for Jacob had compared Judah to a lion.<sup><xref rid="fn93">6</xref></sup> They also tell us that the banner of Ephraim<sup><xref rid="fn94">7</xref></sup> had the image of an ox upon it, in keeping with the verse, <italic>His firstling bullock</italic> (Deut. 33:17). The flag of Dan had the image of an eagle. Thus the banners were similar to the cherubim which the prophet Ezekiel saw.<sup><xref rid="fn95">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>A GOOD WAY OFF. The word <italic>mi-neged</italic> means a good way off.<sup><xref rid="fn96">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. ON THE EAST SIDE TOWARD THE SUNRISING. The beginning of the east.<sup><xref rid="fn97">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND HIS HOST (<italic>U-FEKUDEHEM</italic>). Scripture could have read <italic>u-fekudav</italic> (and his host).<sup><xref rid="fn98">11</xref></sup> There is no difference between the two terms.<sup><xref rid="fn99">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THOSE THAT PITCH NEXT UNTO HIM. <italic>Ve-hachonim alav</italic> means those that pitch with him.<sup><xref rid="fn100">13</xref></sup> Issachar was behind Judah and in front of Zebulun who was third.</p>
<p>9. THEY SHALL SET FORTH FIRST. The meaning of <italic>rishonah yissa&#x2019;u</italic> is, they shall set forth first.<sup><xref rid="fn101">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. ON THE SOUTH SIDE. The word <italic>temanah</italic> (on the south side) comes from the same root as the word <italic>yemin</italic> (right).<sup><xref rid="fn102">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. SECOND. <italic>Sheniyyim</italic> (second) is an adjective.</p>
<p>17. THEN THE TENT OF MEETING, WITH THE CAMP OF THE LEVITES, SHALL SET FORWARD IN THE MIDST OF THE CAMPS. In the midst of the above-mentioned camps,<sup><xref rid="fn103">16</xref></sup> for the Gershonites and Merarites journeyed between the banner of Judah and the banner of Reuben.<sup><xref rid="fn104">17</xref></sup> And the Kohathites, and with them Aaron and his sons, journeyed between the banner of Reuben and the banner of Ephraim.<sup><xref rid="fn105">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>AS THEY ENCAMP, SO SHALL THEY SET FORWARD. The reference is to <italic>the camps</italic>, which refers to the camp of the Israelites. It<sup><xref rid="fn106">19</xref></sup> does not refer to the camp of the Levites. The Gershonites, who pitched on the west<sup><xref rid="fn107">20</xref></sup> of the sanctuary, and the Merarites on the north<sup><xref rid="fn108">21</xref></sup> journeyed together,<sup><xref rid="fn109">22</xref></sup> after the camp of Judah who pitched on the east.<sup><xref rid="fn110">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVERY MAN IN HIS PLACE. The meaning of <italic>al yado</italic> (in his place) is, in his corner and place.<sup><xref rid="fn111">24</xref></sup> The same applies to <italic>yad ha-yarden</italic> (by the side of the Jordan) (Num. 13:29) and <italic>ve-yad tiheyah lekha</italic> (and thou shalt have a paddle) (Deut. 23:13).<sup><xref rid="fn112">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. THESE ARE THEY THAT WERE NUMBERED OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. When they journeyed,<sup><xref rid="fn113">26</xref></sup> they were the same number as on the day that they were counted.<sup><xref rid="fn114">27</xref></sup> Thus not one of them died in twenty days. This is a great wonder.</p>
<p>33. BUT THE LEVITES WERE NOT NUMBERED AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Scripture makes it clear that we should not count even one Levite among those who were counted when they journeyed.<sup><xref rid="fn115">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. THUS DID THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. All the days that they spent in the desert.</p>
<ftnote id="fn88"><sup>1</sup> In most cases, only Moses is mentioned when God addresses commands. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn89"><sup>2</sup> For the burden of the Kohathites, see Num. 4:4-19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn90"><sup>3</sup> The Talmudic sages.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn91"><sup>4</sup> See <italic>Ba-Midbar Rabbah</italic> 2:6.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn93"><sup>6</sup> See Gen. 49:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn94"><sup>7</sup> The son of Joseph.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn95"><sup>8</sup> Each one of the cherubim seen by Ezekiel had four faces, the face of a man, an ox, an eagle, and a lion. See Ezek. 1:10. The camp of Israel similarly carried each one of these four images. In Ezekiel&#x2019;s vision these cherubim supported the divine throne. Similarly, according to the sages, God&#x2019;s spirit rested upon the camp of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn96"><sup>9</sup> The word <italic>neged</italic> literally means opposite. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn97"><sup>10</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>kedemah mizrachah</italic>. This literally means toward the east. According to I.E., <italic>kedemah mizrachah</italic> is a technical term for the beginning of the east, i.e., northeast. See I.E. on Ex. 27:9 and the notes thereto (Vol. 2, pp. 581-2).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn98"><sup>11</sup> As it does in verse 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn99"><sup>12</sup> <italic>U-fekudehem</italic> literally means and their host. <italic>U-fekudav</italic> means and his host. I.E. indicates that Scripture employs the singular for the plural, as the Bible uses collective nouns.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn100"><sup>13</sup> <italic>Alav</italic> literally means on him. Thus the literal meaning of <italic>ve-hachonim alav</italic> (and those that pitch next unto him) is, and those that pitch upon him. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that <italic>alav</italic> means with him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn101"><sup>14</sup> In other words, <italic>rishonah yissa&#x2019;u</italic> should be read as if written <italic>ba-rishonah yissa&#x2019;u</italic>. (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn102"><sup>15</sup> When a person faces east, the south is at his right.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn108"><sup>21</sup> Num. 3:35.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn109"><sup>22</sup> Num. 10:17. Unlike the way they camped.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn110"><sup>23</sup> Judah who pitched on the east marched first, followed by Reuben who pitched on the south, followed by Ephraim who pitched on the west, followed by Dan who pitched on the north. However, the Levites who camped on all four sides of the tabernacle did not follow this order.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn111"><sup>24</sup> The word <italic>yado</italic> literally means his hand. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn112"><sup>25</sup> The word <italic>yad</italic>, literally hand, is to be rendered as place in both of these verses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn113"><sup>26</sup> On the twentieth day of the second month (Num. 10:11).</ftnote>

</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 3</title>
<p>1. NOW THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF AARON AND MOSES. Scripture states this<sup><xref rid="fn116">1</xref></sup> because it wants to inform us that their offspring did not beget children and did not increase<sup><xref rid="fn117">2</xref></sup> in close to ten months.<sup><xref rid="fn118">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>God chose the tribe of Levi at the time God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, when Moses ascended to atone for the making of the golden calf. God then said to Moses, <italic>Bring the tribe of Levi near</italic> (v. 6). The Lord then also related all that is contained in the section<sup><xref rid="fn119">4</xref></sup> that opens with <italic>And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel</italic> (v. 12). When the tabernacle was erected, God told Moses, <italic>Number the children of Levi</italic> (v. 15). God&#x2019;s presence was then manifest in the tabernacle. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>in the wilderness of Sinai</italic> (v. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn120">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the descendants of Aaron and Moses in the wilderness of Sinai numbered the same as they did at Mount Sinai. However, two sons of Aaron were missing.<sup><xref rid="fn121">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>I therefore<sup><xref rid="fn122">7</xref></sup> said that the Levites did not give a ransom for their souls, for Scripture clearly states, <italic>for every one that passed over to them that are numbered</italic> (Ex. 38:26).</p>
<p>Some say that Moses did not count the Israelites before the tabernacle was constructed. He knew their number only by way of prophecy. However, Scripture contradicts them. It clearly states, <italic>When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel</italic> (Ex. 30:11).</p>
<p>3. THE PRIESTS THAT WERE ANOINTED. With the anointing oil, for they were high priests.<sup><xref rid="fn123">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND THEY HAD NO CHILDREN.]<sup><xref rid="fn124">9</xref></sup> They did not leave behind any grown or small children. Therefore the Levites were lacking in number,<sup><xref rid="fn125">10</xref></sup> for it is possible for the grown children to beget children.<sup><xref rid="fn126">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. IN THE PRESENCE OF. I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>al pene</italic> (in the presence of).<sup><xref rid="fn127">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. BEFORE AARON THE PRIEST. Who was the prince of the tribe.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>ve-ha&#x2019;amadt</italic> (and set them)<sup><xref rid="fn128">13</xref></sup> is, <italic>that they may minister. As the Lord liveth, before whom I stand</italic> (amadti) (II Kings 5:16) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn129">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>[7.] AND THE CHARGE OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION. In the offering of sacrifices.</p>
<p>8. AND THE CHARGE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. They will make sure that an Israelite does not enter the tabernacle.</p>
<p>9. THEY ARE WHOLLY GIVEN UNTO HIM. Forever. Or to them and their descendants who take their place.<sup><xref rid="fn130">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNTO AARON AND TO HIS SONS. Both those who are presently alive and those who will arise after them.</p>
<p>FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. To be separated from the children of Israel.</p>
<p>10. AND THOU SHALT APPOINT AARON AND HIS SONS. <italic>His sons</italic> includes the sons of his sons.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>and thou shalt appoint</italic> (tifkod) is, you shall appoint each one of them.<sup><xref rid="fn131">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>that they may keep their priesthood</italic> is that they not do anything that will disqualify them from being priests.</p>
<p>AND THE COMMON MAN THAT DRAWETH NIGH. To the priest, to serve as a priest.</p>
<p>[SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH.] An Israelite or a Levite who serves as a priest shall be put to death.</p>
<p>The chapter that opens with the words <italic>And I, behold, I have taken the Levites</italic><sup><xref rid="fn132">17</xref></sup> is also<sup><xref rid="fn133">18</xref></sup> connected to the chapter which preceded it,<sup><xref rid="fn134">19</xref></sup> for the Torah contains chapters that are separated but are connected by content. Similarly, <italic>Moreover the hand of the Lord was against them, to discomfit them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed</italic> (Deut. 2:15),<sup><xref rid="fn135">20</xref></sup> and, <italic>And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt</italic> (Ex. 6:28).<sup><xref rid="fn136">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND I, BEHOLD, I HAVE TAKEN THE LEVITES. The Levites have been greatly elevated.</p>
<p>FIRST-BORN. <italic>Bekhor</italic> (first-born) is connected to <italic>peter</italic> (openeth).<sup><xref rid="fn137">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE LEVITES SHALL BE MINE. They shall be holy unto Me.</p>
<p>13. FOR ALL THE FIRST-BORN ARE MINE. Its meaning is, for also the first-born are Mine.</p>
<p>ON THE DAY THAT I SMOTE. This means at the time that I smote.<sup><xref rid="fn138">23</xref></sup> There are many such cases.<sup><xref rid="fn139">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>MINE THEY SHALL BE. This means they are Mine and they shall be Mine,<sup><xref rid="fn140">25</xref></sup> for all human first-born and similarly the first-born of unclean cattle<sup><xref rid="fn141">26</xref></sup> shall be redeemed.</p>
<p>15. FROM A MONTH OLD AND UPWARD. Until the sun and moon are once again in conjunction,<sup><xref rid="fn142">27</xref></sup> or until the moon returns to its approximate place of departure<sup><xref rid="fn143">28</xref></sup> and its original position and its present place are near each other.<sup><xref rid="fn144">29</xref></sup> The intelligent person will understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn145">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. GERSHON. For he was the first-born. In Chronicles the name is spelled with a <italic>mem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn146">31</xref></sup> in place of a <italic>nun</italic> (I Chron. 6:1).</p>
<p>21. OF GERSHON WAS THE FAMILY OF THE LIBNITES, AND THE FAMILY OF THE SHIMEITES. Its meaning is, these two families numbered the following amount.<sup><xref rid="fn147">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. BEHIND THE TABERNACLE. <italic>Achare</italic> (behind) means the same as <italic>achore</italic> (behind).<sup><xref rid="fn148">33</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>achor va-kedem</italic> (behind and before) (Ps. 139:5).<sup><xref rid="fn149">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>WESTWARD. The term employed for westward is <italic>yamah</italic> because the great Spanish sea<sup><xref rid="fn150">35</xref></sup> lies west of the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>25. THE TABERNACLE. The reference is to the ten curtains.<sup><xref rid="fn151">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE TENT. The reference is to the eleven curtains.<sup><xref rid="fn152">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE COVERING THEREOF. The covering which covered the cover is included.<sup><xref rid="fn153">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. WHICH IS BY THE TABERNACLE. Which is inside the court.</p>
<p>AND BY THE ALTAR. Which is outside the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn154">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>[ROUND ABOUT.] Its meaning is that there was no place<sup><xref rid="fn155">40</xref></sup> that was not enclosed; there was no opening that was uncovered.</p>
<p>EVEN WHATSOEVER PERTAINETH TO THE SERVICE THEREOF. I will explain this later.<sup><xref rid="fn156">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. KEEPERS OF THE CHARGE OF THE HOLY.<sup><xref rid="fn157">42</xref></sup> The reference is to the ark. The ark, as I have previously explained,<sup><xref rid="fn158">43</xref></sup> is referred to as the holy, in contrast to the tabernacle.</p>
<p>29. SOUTHWARD. Kohath was placed at the right<sup><xref rid="fn159">44</xref></sup> because he was the most important of all the sons of Levi, and the right is more important than the left<sup><xref rid="fn160">45</xref></sup> or the back.<sup><xref rid="fn161">46</xref></sup> There is no side, with the exception of the east,<sup><xref rid="fn162">47</xref></sup> more important.</p>
<p>Gershon had an advantage over Merari, for Gershon was the first-born of Levi. Hence he carried that which was holy,<sup><xref rid="fn163">48</xref></sup> in contrast to what Merari carried.<sup><xref rid="fn164">49</xref></sup> Gershon<sup><xref rid="fn165">50</xref></sup> therefore camped on the west,<sup><xref rid="fn166">51</xref></sup> like the standard of Ephraim.<sup><xref rid="fn167">52</xref></sup> Merari camped on the north<sup><xref rid="fn168">53</xref></sup> like Dan,<sup><xref rid="fn169">54</xref></sup> who was the son of the handmaid.</p>
<p>Now the Kohathites camped next to the banner of Reuben. Korah<sup><xref rid="fn170">55</xref></sup> therefore joined with Dathan and Abiram.<sup><xref rid="fn171">56</xref></sup> I will explain this later.</p>
<p>31. AND THE ALTARS. Both of them.<sup><xref rid="fn172">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE VESSELS OF THE SANCTUARY WHEREWITH THE PRIESTS MINISTER. The reference is to the vessels of the menorah, the table, and the altars.</p>
<p>Many erred in explaining the meaning of <italic>and the screen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn173">58</xref></sup> <italic>and all that pertaineth to the service thereof</italic>. It is clearly true that the reference is to the screen of the door of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p>AND ALL THAT PERTAINETH TO THE SERVICE THEREOF. Its cords.</p>
<p>32. PRINCE OF THE PRINCES OF THE LEVITES. There were three princes of Levi.<sup><xref rid="fn174">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>The term <italic>nesi&#x2019;e</italic> (princes) in the phrase <italic>nesi&#x2019;e ha-levi</italic> (princes of Levi) applies to the word <italic>levi</italic> and also to another word.<sup><xref rid="fn175">60</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>lo</italic> (not) in <italic>It is not the great that are wise</italic> (Job 32:9).<sup><xref rid="fn176">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second part of our verse is to be interpreted as if written <italic>the princes having the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn177">62</xref></sup> Its meaning is that these three princes had oversight over the keepers of the charge of the sanctuary, who were Levites.</p>
<p>35. NORTHWARD. It is possible that the word <italic>tzafonah</italic> (northward) is derived from the word <italic>tzafanta</italic> (laid up) in <italic>Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee</italic> (Ps. 31:20) and from the word <italic>tzafon</italic> (laid up) in <italic>laid up for the righteous</italic> (Prov. 13:22). The north is so called because there is nothing in the south.<sup><xref rid="fn178">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. EASTWARD&#x2026;TOWARD THE SUNRISING. <italic>Mizrachah</italic> means toward the sunrising. It refers to the place where the circles<sup><xref rid="fn179">64</xref></sup> come together.</p>
<p>Observe, the tent of Moses, the tent of Aaron, and the tent of his children and his children&#x2019;s children and all their entire households were in the east.<sup><xref rid="fn180">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE COMMON MAN THAT DREW NIGH. To the holy place.<sup><xref rid="fn181">66</xref></sup> Note, all the Levites camped around the tabernacle in order to guard it.</p>
<p>39. WERE TWENTY AND TWO THOUSAND. In all. When you add up the figures you will find that they come to three hundred above the figure given in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn182">67</xref></sup> Some say that Scripture is being brief and mentions only the thousands and neglects the hundreds.<sup><xref rid="fn183">68</xref></sup> However, this cannot be the case. Scripture mentions less than three hundred over and above a round number.<sup><xref rid="fn184">69</xref></sup> The truth is in accordance with tradition which states that a first-born does not free a first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn185">70</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse thus is, all that were numbered of the Levites with the exception of the first-born [were twenty and two thousand].</p>
<p>Judah the Persian<sup><xref rid="fn186">71</xref></sup> calculated to prove, from the number that the first-born of the Levites were one seventy-third of the Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn187">72</xref></sup> He went on to say that if you divide the number of Israelites<sup><xref rid="fn188">73</xref></sup> by seventy-three,<sup><xref rid="fn189">74</xref></sup> and take the number of Levites who came to serve in the tabernacle<sup><xref rid="fn190">75</xref></sup> rather than the number of Levites age one month and above,<sup><xref rid="fn191">76</xref></sup> then the number will be close.<sup><xref rid="fn192">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, all this is nothing. The Israelites were counted from twenty and above. No other fixed unit was used.<sup><xref rid="fn193">78</xref></sup> However, the Levites were counted from twenty to fifty. There is a large difference between them.<sup><xref rid="fn194">79</xref></sup> We will rely only on tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn195">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. NUMBER ALL THE FIRST-BORN MALES. Note that males is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn196">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. AND THE CATTLE OF THE LEVITES.<sup><xref rid="fn197">82</xref></sup> So that the Levites do not lose. The firstlings among the cattle are also for the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn198">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>45. TAKE THE LEVITES. A second time.<sup><xref rid="fn199">84</xref></sup> It is as if it stated, when you take the Levites, then those who are over and above will be redeemed.<sup><xref rid="fn200">85</xref></sup> The word <italic>peduye</italic> (redemption of) is connected to the number.<sup><xref rid="fn201">86</xref></sup> There are many other such instances.</p>
<p>The disputers say<sup><xref rid="fn202">87</xref></sup> that here we learn that the redemption price of every first-born is five shekels. However, there is no proof here,<sup><xref rid="fn203">88</xref></sup> for this commandment stands by itself.<sup><xref rid="fn204">89</xref></sup> The truth is in keeping with tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn205">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>49. REDEMPTION. <italic>Pidyom</italic> (redemption) is spelled with a <italic>mem</italic> in place of a <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn206">91</xref></sup> Compare, Gershon.<sup><xref rid="fn207">92</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn116"><sup>1</sup> Our Torah portion deals with the census taken in the second year following the Exodus (see Num. 1:1; 3:14). The question thus arises, why does Scripture then tell us how many offspring Moses and Aaron had on the day that the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn117"><sup>2</sup> In other words, the generations of Moses and Aaron were the same at the time of the census as they had been on the day that Moses stood on Mount Sinai ten months earlier. Hence it was not necessary to count them again when the Levites were counted. See verse 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn118"><sup>3</sup> Ten months passed from the day that Moses stood on Mount Sinai in the month of Sivan and the census was taken on the first day of the second month (Iyyar) following the Exodus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn119"><sup>4</sup> Verses 12 and 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn120"><sup>5</sup> And not on Mount Sinai. The point is that the Levites were numbered when the tabernacle stood at the foot of Mount Sinai. Scripture tells us that God spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai and told him to number the Levites, because once the tabernacle was erected God&#x2019;s presence was manifest there, and God spoke to Moses there. Thus what is reported in 3:1-13 took place on Mount Sinai, and what is reported in 3:14-39 took place in the wilderness of Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn121"><sup>6</sup> This is the point of verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn122"><sup>7</sup> According to I.E. only those who went forth to war were counted by offering half a shekel as ransom for their souls. However, the Levites were in the service of God and did not have to offer a ransom for their souls. See I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary on Ex. 38:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn123"><sup>8</sup> Being anointed with the anointing oil (<italic>shemen ha-mishkhah</italic>) gave the sons of Aaron the status of high priests.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn124"><sup>9</sup> <italic>And they had no children</italic> appears in verse 4, but I.E. comments upon it here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn125"><sup>10</sup> For the other tribes increased in number from the first census. The tribe of Levi did not do so due to the loss of Nadab and Abihu.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn126"><sup>11</sup> Hence Scripture tells us that Nadab and Abihu did not have any.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn127"><sup>12</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 11:28 (Vol. 1, p. 146). There I.E. explains that <italic>al pene</italic> means in the presence of. The literal meaning of <italic>al pene</italic> is, upon the face of.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn128"><sup>13</sup> Literally, and stand them up.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn129"><sup>14</sup> Its meaning is, <italic>As the Lord liveth, before whom I minister</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn130"><sup>15</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>netunim netunim</italic> (wholly given). This literally means, given given. I.E.&#x2019;s first interpretation is that the repetition of the tern <italic>netunim</italic> indicates forever. His second interpretation is that the first <italic>netunim</italic> refers to them, and the second to their children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn131"><sup>16</sup> <italic>Tifkod</italic> can meant to count. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn132"><sup>17</sup> Verses 12 and 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn133"><sup>18</sup> Like many other such chapters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn134"><sup>19</sup> In other words, verse 12 is connected to verse 10. In the Masoretic Bible, verse 11 opens a new chapter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn135"><sup>20</sup> Deut. 2:16 is connected to Deut. 2:17 even though they are in different chapters in the Masoretic Bible. See I.E. on Deut. 2:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn136"><sup>21</sup> According to I.E., Ex. 6:28 is connected to that which follows even though they are in different chapters in the Masoretic Bible. See I.E. on Ex. 6:28 (Vol. 2, pp. 141-2).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn137"><sup>22</sup> I.E. comments thus because the canticle reading is, every first-born, openeth the womb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn138"><sup>23</sup> The first-born were smitten at night. See Ex. 11:4,5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn139"><sup>24</sup> Where day means time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn140"><sup>25</sup> The verse opens in the present (for all the first-born are Mine) and concludes with the future (Mine shall they be).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn149"><sup>34</sup> We thus see that the word <italic>achor</italic> means behind, for <italic>kedem</italic> means front.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn183"><sup>68</sup> In other words, 22,000 is a round number.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn184"><sup>69</sup> In listing the first-born, Scripture gives their number as 22,273 (v. 43). We thus see that Scripture does not employ round numbers in our chapter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn185"><sup>70</sup> See <italic>Bekhorot</italic> 4a. In other words, there were 300 first-born who were Levites. These 300 did not free Israelites from the necessity of redemption, because they had to free themselves.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn193"><sup>78</sup> There was no other age limitation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn194"><sup>79</sup> We cannot draw any conclusion from the number of Israelites and the number of Levites given by Scripture, for they apply to different age groups.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn195"><sup>80</sup> That the 300 were first-born. We cannot prove that this was the case from Scripture itself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn196"><sup>81</sup> Males (<italic>zakhor</italic>) qualifies first-born.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn197"><sup>82</sup> The cattle of the Levites which redeemed the first-born cattle of the Israelites remained with the Levites. Thus the Levites did not lose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn198"><sup>83</sup> The first part of our verse indicates that all human first-born belong to the Lord. It does not say the same with regard to the first-born of the cattle. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn199"><sup>84</sup> In other words, Scripture repeats itself, for it has already told us in verse 41 that God told Moses to take the Levites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn200"><sup>85</sup> In other words, take the Levites should be interpreted, when you take the Levites. Furthermore, when you take the Levites is connected to verse 46.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn201"><sup>86</sup> Our text reads, <italic>peduye ha-sheloshah</italic>. Now a word is usually not in the construct with a number. We thus say, <italic>shene chakahamim</italic> (two wise men), not <italic>chakhme shenaim</italic> (wise men of two) (Filwarg). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn202"><sup>87</sup> Hebrew, <italic>yesh makhhishim</italic> (there are those who dispute). This is a term usually applied to Karaites. However, in view of the fact that what the alleged disputers say is not in contradiction to tradition, it is hard to understand why I.E. refers to them as disputers. Indeed, Motot suggests changing the reading to <italic>yesh mefareshim</italic> (some interpret), and <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads, <italic>Some say</italic>. Meijler suggest that the disputers also brought proof from this that (contrary to <italic>halakha</italic>) the first-born of Levites require redemption, for the first-born of the Levites did not exempt the first-born of Israel for all time.</ftnote>

<p>2. TAKE THE SUM OF THE SONS OF KOHATH. First, because of Moses and Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn208">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. FROM THIRTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD. Close to four weeks.<sup><xref rid="fn209">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>[EVEN UNTIL FIFTY YEARS OLD.] A fifty-year-old is seven weeks of age. The body&#x2019;s strength then declines.</p>
<p>TO DO WORK IN THE TENT OF MEETING. The work of bearing.</p>
<p>4. ABOUT THE MOST HOLY THINGS. The reference is to the ark.</p>
<p>5. THE VEIL OF THE SCREEN. Which covers the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn210">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND SHALL PUT THEREON. On the cover.<sup><xref rid="fn211">4</xref></sup> Others say that the word <italic>alav</italic> (thereon) refers to the word <italic>et</italic> (v. 5), which precedes <italic>parokhet</italic> (the veil).<sup><xref rid="fn212">5</xref></sup> <italic>Va-titzpeno</italic> (and hid him)<sup><xref rid="fn213">6</xref></sup> (Josh. 2:6) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn214">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SHALL SPREAD OVER IT A CLOTH ALL OF BLUE. <italic>Kelil tekhelet</italic> means all of blue.</p>
<p>OVER IT. Some say, over the covering of <italic>tachash</italic> (sealskin). However, it appears to me that its meaning is, and they had already spread a cloth all of blue over the screen covering.<sup><xref rid="fn215">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the blue cover was used in order to glorify the ark, then the first interpretation appears correct.<sup><xref rid="fn216">9</xref></sup> The <italic>tachash</italic> covering served to protect [the ark] from the rain and the dust.<sup><xref rid="fn217">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SHALL SET THE STAVES THEREOF. Note, they removed the staves until the ark was covered.<sup><xref rid="fn218">11</xref></sup> Some say that they shall set the staves upon the shoulders of the bearers.<sup><xref rid="fn219">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>[7.] AND UPON THE TABLE OF SHOWBREAD. To teach us that there were other tables there<sup><xref rid="fn220">13</xref></sup> for the use of the meat.<sup><xref rid="fn221">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, the showbread which was placed upon this table was not removed.<sup><xref rid="fn222">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. A CLOTH OF SCARLET. Look. There were two cloth coverings<sup><xref rid="fn223">16</xref></sup> plus a covering of skin upon the table. There were similarly a screen covering,<sup><xref rid="fn224">17</xref></sup> a blue cloth covering, and a covering of skin over the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn225">18</xref></sup> A cloth covering and a cover of skin were over the menorah.<sup><xref rid="fn226">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND SHALL PUT IT UPON A BAR. For it did not have any staves.<sup><xref rid="fn227">20</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>and they bore it upon a pole</italic> (Num. 13:25).<sup><xref rid="fn228">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>13. AND THEY SHALL TAKE AWAY THE ASHES. It means, and they shall take away the ashes from the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn232">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. THESE THINGS ARE THE BURDEN OF THE SONS OF KOHATH IN THE TENT OF MEETING. For they did not carry the tent and the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn233">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THE CHARGE OF. <italic>U-fekudat</italic> (and the charge of) is related to the word <italic>pakid</italic> (overseer).<sup><xref rid="fn234">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE OIL FOR THE LIGHT. Some say that Eleazar carried oil for one night&#x2019;s light and similarly the continual meal offering.<sup><xref rid="fn235">28</xref></sup> However, I believe that Eleazar was in charge of giving <italic>the oil for the light</italic>, that is, of the utensil containing the oil for the light, and similarly the vessel containing the anointing oil and the vessel containing the sweet incense, to the children of Kohath.</p>
<p>[HE SHALL HAVE THE CHARGE OF ALL THE TABERNACLE.] Scripture states this because Eleazar had charge over the tabernacle along with his brother Ithamar.<sup><xref rid="fn236">29</xref></sup> However, Eleazar alone had charge over the oil, the sweet incense, and the meal offering because of his great status.</p>
<p>17. [UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON.] Scripture states this because Aaron and his sons were commanded to take heed that the sons of Kohath do not come to the penalty of excision (<italic>karet</italic>).</p>
<p>18. The command <italic>Cut ye not off</italic> was given to Moses, Aaron and his sons.</p>
<p>19. THAT THEY MAY LIVE. That their lives may be extended.</p>
<p>AND NOT DIE. By excision. The meaning of our verse is that the family of the Kohathites will be rewarded if they observe and will be punished if they do not. Without the phrase <italic>and not die</italic>, our verse could be taken to imply that they will not be punished.</p>
<p>AND APPOINT THEM.<sup><xref rid="fn237">30</xref></sup> The ark, the table, the menorah, and the altars.</p>
<p>EVERY ONE TO HIS SERVICE. This refers to the holy vessels.</p>
<p>AND TO HIS BURDEN. To be carried on the shoulder.</p>
<p>20. BUT THEY SHALL NOT GO IN. The Kohathites shall not go in to the tent of meeting to see the holy things as they are being covered.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>ke-vala et ha-kodesh</italic> (the holy things as they are being covered) is, when the structure is taken down, the veil of the curtain is removed and the ark is revealed.<sup><xref rid="fn238">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that the meaning of <italic>ke-vala</italic> is, when they are being covered. Thus the meaning of <italic>ke-vala et ha-kodesh</italic> is, when they cover the ark in order to carry it.<sup><xref rid="fn239">32</xref></sup> This interpretation is more plausible than the first one. Now there are two prohibitions. One, not to touch the holy vessels-they are to be carried only by staves. Two, the Kohathites shall not see the holy things.</p>

<p>22. TAKE THE SUM. <italic>Naso</italic> (take the sum) is an infinitive. It is like <italic>zakhor</italic> (remember) in <italic>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy</italic> (Ex. 20:8).<sup><xref rid="fn240">33</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>naso</italic> is, take the sum.<sup><xref rid="fn241">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>ALSO. Because he had already counted the Kohathites.</p>
<p>24. IN SERVING. To put up the tabernacle, to make the showbread, to slaughter, and to guard.</p>
<p>AND IN BEARING BURDENS. <italic>Le-massa</italic><sup><xref rid="fn242">35</xref></sup> (bearing burdens) is an infinitive. Similarly <italic>le-massa</italic><sup><xref rid="fn243">36</xref></sup> (causing to set forward) in <italic>and for causing the camps to set forward</italic> (Num. 10:2). The forms of verbs change.<sup><xref rid="fn244">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THE COVERING OF SEALSKIN THAT IS ABOVE IT. Scripture is being brief, for it does not mention the ramskin covering.<sup><xref rid="fn245">38</xref></sup> Some say that the two coverings were attached.<sup><xref rid="fn246">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF THEIR SERVICE. Such as tables, pegs, and cords.</p>
<p>AND WHATSOEVER THERE MAY BE TO DO WITH THEM. The instruments of service, or the tabernacle and the altar.</p>
<p>29. AS FOR THE SONS OF MERARI. Scripture does not mention that they were counted, for this section<sup><xref rid="fn247">40</xref></sup> is connected to the one above.<sup><xref rid="fn248">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>47. THE WORK OF SERVICE. This is to be understood as I have already explained.<sup><xref rid="fn249">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the meaning of <italic>All those that were numbered</italic> (v. 46) is, all those from thirty years old that were numbered.<sup><xref rid="fn250">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>49. EVERY ONE. The reference is to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>
<p>TO HIS SERVICE, AND TO HIS BURDEN. Hence <italic>and his numbered</italic><sup><xref rid="fn251">44</xref></sup> follows.</p>
<p>The section <italic>put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead</italic> (Num. 5:2) follows, because God&#x2019;s presence was in the camps of Israel when they journeyed and when they rested.<sup><xref rid="fn252">45</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn208"><sup>1</sup> Moses and Aaron were descended from Kohath. Hence the sons of Kohath were counted first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn209"><sup>2</sup> The Hebrew word for week is <italic>shavu&#x2019;a. Shavu&#x2019;a</italic> is related to the word <italic>sheva</italic> (seven). Hence I.E. believes that <italic>shavu&#x2019;a</italic> can also refer to seven years. Thus &#x201C;four weeks&#x201D; would equal 28 years. According to I.E. there is a mystical significance to the number seven. See I.E. on Gen. 8:5 (Vol. 1, p. 114, n. 16) and the notes thereto. Also see <italic>The Secret of the Torah</italic>, a translation and annotation of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s <italic>Yesod Morah</italic> by H. Norman Strickman (Jason Aaronson, NJ, 1995, p. 125).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn210"><sup>3</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>parokhet ha-masakh</italic>. This literally means the screen which covers. I.E. explains that the screen is so called because it covers the ark. See Ex. 40:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn211"><sup>4</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>ve-natenu alav</italic> (and put thereon). However, <italic>parokhet</italic> is feminine. Thus our text should read <italic>aleha</italic> rather then <italic>alav</italic>. Hence I.E. notes than <italic>alav</italic> refers to the word <italic>masakh</italic> (covering/screen).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn212"><sup>5</sup> The word <italic>et</italic> (the sign of the accusative) serves both the masculine and the feminine. Hence I.E. believes that either a masculine or a feminine proportional pronoun may follow a word which has <italic>et</italic> in front of it (Filwarg). Thus the word <italic>alav</italic> can refer to <italic>et parokhet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn213"><sup>6</sup> Translated literally. See next note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn214"><sup>7</sup> The text should have read, <italic>and hid them</italic>, for the reference is to the two spies sent by Joshua. Now <italic>hid him</italic> is preceded by <italic>et shene ha-anashim</italic> (the two men). However, since the word <italic>et</italic> is used both with the singular and the plural, a singular or a plural may follow a phrase preceded by <italic>et</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn215"><sup>8</sup> In other words, <italic>u-fareshu</italic> (and shall spread) is a pluperfect and is to be rendered, and they had already spread. According to this interpretation, the blue cover was placed on the ark, and the <italic>tachash</italic> (sealskin) covering was placed over the blue covering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn216"><sup>9</sup> Blue is a royal color. Hence it stands to reason that if it was placed on the ark, it should be visible.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn217"><sup>10</sup> Unlike the blue covering, which served as a decoration.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn218"><sup>11</sup> According to Ex. 25:15 the staves were never to be removed from the ark. I.E. believes that the staves were momentarily removed while the ark was being covered. Hence Scripture states, and shall set the staves thereof (back in place).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn219"><sup>12</sup> In other words, the meaning of <italic>and they shall set the staves thereof</italic> is, they shall set the staves upon the bearers of the ark. Thus our verse does not imply that the staves were ever removed from the ark. See <italic>Tosafot Yoma</italic> 72a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn220"><sup>13</sup> Hence Scripture identifies the table.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn221"><sup>14</sup> For the use of the sacrificial meat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn222"><sup>15</sup> Hence it is referred to as the table of showbread.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn223"><sup>16</sup> One of blue (v. 7) and one of scarlet (v. 8).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn224"><sup>17</sup> The <italic>parokhot ha-masakh</italic> (v. 5).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn225"><sup>18</sup> Verse 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn226"><sup>19</sup> Verses 9 and 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn227"><sup>20</sup> By which to carry it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn228"><sup>21</sup> There too the grapes, which of course did not have any staves, were placed on a bar in order to be carried. Weiser suggests that I.E. believed that bar is to be interpreted as two bars, in the same manner that pole is to be interpreted as poles.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn229"><sup>22</sup> Hebrew, <italic>beged acher</italic>. Some emend to one cloth (<italic>beged echad</italic>) (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn230"><sup>23</sup> The reference is to a covering of <italic>tachash</italic> (sealskin).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn231"><sup>24</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s comment is misplaced. It belongs in verse 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn232"><sup>25</sup> The word <italic>deshen</italic> means ashes. Thus <italic>ve-dishenu</italic> literally means, and they shall ash. This might be taken to mean, and they shall put on ashes. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation that <italic>ve-dishenu</italic> means, and they shall remove the ashes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn233"><sup>26</sup> Scripture states, <italic>These things are the burden</italic>, because they did not do any carrying.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn234"><sup>27</sup> One who assigns tasks.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn235"><sup>28</sup> The daily continual meal offering. See <italic>Yerushalmi, Sabbath</italic> 10:13. Eleazar carried oil for the lighting in his right hand and the sweet incense in his left hand, while the continual meal offering hung from his arm.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn236"><sup>29</sup> If Eleazar was in charge of the entire tabernacle, why does Scripture tell us that he was in charge of the oil, the sweet incense, and the meal offering? Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn237"><sup>30</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ve-samu otam</italic>, which literally means, and put them. This can be interpreted as referring to the <italic>kohanim</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn238"><sup>31</sup> According to I.E. the meaning of <italic>the holy things as they are being covered</italic> is, when the holy (i.e., the tabernacle) is taken down.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn239"><sup>32</sup> In other words, <italic>ke-vala</italic> means when it is covered. The word <italic>bala</italic> means swallowed. Thus <italic>ke-vala</italic> literally means when he swallows, i.e., when he covers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn240"><sup>33</sup> Which is an infinitive too.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn241"><sup>34</sup> In other words, even though <italic>naso</italic> is an infinitive, it has the meaning of an imperative. The same applies to <italic>zakhor</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn242"><sup>35</sup> From the root <italic>nun, sin, alef</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn243"><sup>36</sup> From the root <italic>nun, sin, ayin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn244"><sup>37</sup> <italic>Le-massa</italic> in our verse is vocalized <italic>kamatz, pattach</italic>. <italic>Le-massa</italic> in Num. 10:2 is vocalized <italic>pattach, pattach</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn245"><sup>38</sup> Which was above the sealskin covering. See Ex. 26:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn246"><sup>39</sup> Thus the covering of sealskin includes the ramskin covering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn247"><sup>40</sup> Verses 29-37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn248"><sup>41</sup> Verses 21-28. Thus the command <italic>Take the sum of</italic> in verse 22 also applies here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn249"><sup>42</sup> In his comments on verse 15, I.E. hints that the term <italic>work of service</italic> applies to the carrying of the tent and the tabernacle, which was the work assigned to the sons of Gershon and Merari, while the term <italic>the work of bearing burdens</italic> refers to the work done by the sons of Kohath (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn250"><sup>43</sup> In other words, our verse is a continuation of verse 46.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn251"><sup>44</sup> Hebrew, <italic>u-fekudav</italic>. The singular <italic>u-fekudav</italic> is employed because the terms which precede it (<italic>avodato</italic>, his service, and <italic>masa&#x2019;o</italic>, his burden) are i n the singular. It should be noted that J.P.S. renders <italic>u-fekudav</italic> as <italic>they were also numbered</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn252"><sup>45</sup> Hence all those who were unclean had to leave the camp.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 5</title>
<p>2. EVERY LEPER, AND EVERY ONE THAT HATH AN ISSUE,<sup><xref rid="fn253">1</xref></sup> AND WHOSOEVER IS UNCLEAN BY THE DEAD. These are states of uncleanliness that last for seven days. They also render others unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn254">2</xref></sup> Therefore a person who had a seminal omission does not leave the camp.<sup><xref rid="fn255">3</xref></sup> Similarly, no place was setaside outside the camp<sup><xref rid="fn256">4</xref></sup> for the performing of bodily functions.<sup><xref rid="fn257">5</xref></sup> On the contrary, each person dug in his own tent<sup><xref rid="fn258">6</xref></sup> as is the custom with all the camps, for there were children among them.<sup><xref rid="fn259">7</xref></sup> Now the section which opens with <italic>When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies</italic> (Deut. 23:10) speaks of a small camp wherein there are no women, and the ark is among them and they do not surround the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn260">8</xref></sup> [They have to leave the camp],<sup><xref rid="fn261">9</xref></sup> for God&#x2019;s presence is in the center of any Israelite camp. I will explain this in its proper place.<sup><xref rid="fn262">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. FEMALE. A woman who has an irregular menstrual flow,<sup><xref rid="fn263">11</xref></sup> a normal menstrual flow,<sup><xref rid="fn264">12</xref></sup> a woman who is a leper<sup><xref rid="fn265">13</xref></sup> or who was made unclean by a dead body.<sup><xref rid="fn266">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID SO. Immediately, before they journeyed. When the unclean journeyed, they journeyed between the standard of Ephraim<sup><xref rid="fn267">15</xref></sup> and the standard of Dan.<sup><xref rid="fn268">16</xref></sup> The aforementioned is based on logic,<sup><xref rid="fn269">17</xref></sup> for this is not explained in Scripture.</p>
<p>The section that begins with <italic>When a man or woman</italic> [<italic>shall commit any sin that men commit, to commit a trespass against the Lord</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn270">18</xref></sup> follows the previous chapter<sup><xref rid="fn271">19</xref></sup> because leprosy and unclean issue<sup><xref rid="fn272">20</xref></sup> are brought about by trespassing against the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn273">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reason this section is repeated<sup><xref rid="fn274">22</xref></sup> is that the Torah wants to mention <italic>but if the man have no kinsman</italic> (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn275">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THEN THEY SHALL CONFESS. Whichever one it be, a man or a woman.</p>
<p>IN FULL. <italic>Be-rosho</italic> (in full) means as it is, not less than it is.<sup><xref rid="fn276">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ADD UNTO IT THE FIFTH PART. If he confesses on his own. However, if there are witnesses then he shall add two fifths. Those who transmitted the law<sup><xref rid="fn277">25</xref></sup> say a fifth of a fifth.<sup><xref rid="fn278">26</xref></sup> Their minds are greater than ours.</p>
<p>8. THE RESTITUTION&#x2026;SHALL BE THE LORDS. For he made restitution because of his fear of the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn279">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND EVERY MAN&#x2019;S HALLOWED THINGS SHALL BE HIS. Its meaning is that they belong to the one who hallows them. He may give them to any <italic>kohen</italic> that he wants to. This is noted because Scripture mentions the gifts given to the <italic>kohanim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn280">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The portion dealing with a straying wife follows<sup><xref rid="fn281">29</xref></sup> because the straying wife commits a trespass against her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn282">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. IF ANY MAN&#x2019;S WIFE GO ASIDE. <italic>Tisteh</italic> means will go aside from the right way.<sup><xref rid="fn283">31</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>seteh</italic> (go aside) in <italic>Go aside from it</italic> (Prov. 4:15).</p>
<p>13. CARNALLY. <italic>Shikhvat zera</italic> (carnally) refers to carnal laying. It is called <italic>shikhvat zera</italic><sup><xref rid="fn284">32</xref></sup> because its purpose is for seed.<sup><xref rid="fn285">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND IT BE HID. She did not reveal the matter. There is not even one witness through whom she is suspect.</p>
<p>NEITHER SHE BE TAKEN IN THE ACT. By witnesses, men or women, so that she be suspected.</p>
<p>14. AND THE SPIRIT OF JEALOUSY COME UPON HIM. <italic>Ru&#x2019;ach</italic> (spirit) is masculine here.<sup><xref rid="fn286">34</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>ru&#x2019;ach</italic> (wind) in <italic>and a great and strong wind</italic> (I Kings 19:11).<sup><xref rid="fn287">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>COME. Come upon his mind.</p>
<p>15. BRING. Against her will.</p>
<p>FOR HER. <italic>Aleha</italic> (for her) means with her or because of her.<sup><xref rid="fn288">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>BARLEY MEAL. Our rabbis said, she acted like a beast, let her bring the food of a beast.<sup><xref rid="fn289">37</xref></sup> A free-will meal offering consists of pure wheat flower so that the celebrant will be remembered for good. However, this meal offering recalls a sin, if a sin was committed. Hence it is an inferior offering and consists of barley without oil and without frankincense.</p>
<p>16. AND THE PRIEST SHALL BRING HER NEAR. <italic>Her</italic><sup><xref rid="fn290">38</xref></sup> refers to the meal offering.<sup><xref rid="fn291">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SET HER<sup><xref rid="fn292">40</xref></sup> BEFORE THE LORD. Before the altar.</p>
<p>17. HOLY WATER. From the basin, for it has already become holy.<sup><xref rid="fn293">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>ON THE FLOOR OF THE TABERNACLE. The reference is to the well-known floor.<sup><xref rid="fn294">42</xref></sup> The word <italic>afar</italic> (dust) has a definite article before it. It refers to the earth which is beneath the floor.<sup><xref rid="fn295">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND LET THE HAIR OF THE WOMAN&#x2019;S HEAD GO LOOSE. <italic>Para</italic> (go loose) means he shall uncover.<sup><xref rid="fn296">44</xref></sup> However, I believe that it means he shall take out the hair of the woman, which was covered, and let it go loose.</p>
<p>THE WATER OF BITTERNESS. It is my opinion that the word <italic>me</italic> (water) is in the construct<sup><xref rid="fn297">45</xref></sup> and the word <italic>ha-marim</italic> is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn298">46</xref></sup> If so, then its secret is known.<sup><xref rid="fn299">47</xref></sup> It is also possible that the waters were so called because of their ultimate taste.<sup><xref rid="fn300">48</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And stripped the naked of their clothing</italic> (Job 22:6).<sup><xref rid="fn301">49</xref></sup> <italic>And the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter</italic> (v. 24) is proof of this, for this verse indicates that the <italic>oaths</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn302">50</xref></sup> which <italic>they that cause the curses</italic><sup><xref rid="fn303">51</xref></sup> refers to, will make the sweet waters bitter.</p>
<p>The word <italic>ha-me&#x2019;arerim</italic> (that causeth the curse) is a <italic>hifil</italic>. It is like the word <italic>erarah</italic> (cursed) in <italic>which the Lord hath cursed</italic> (Gen. 5:29).<sup><xref rid="fn304">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. [SHALL CAUSE HER TO SWEAR.] Its meaning is that the woman shall answer, <italic>Amen, Amen</italic>.</p>
<p>IF NO MAN HAVE LAIN WITH THEE. Its meaning is, if another man has not forced himself upon you.<sup><xref rid="fn305">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND IF THOU HAST NOT GONE ASIDE. Willingly. <italic>Satit</italic> means you have gone aside and committed an unclean act.<sup><xref rid="fn306">54</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>thou shalt not build it of hewn stones</italic> (Ex. 20:25).<sup><xref rid="fn307">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>BE THOU FREE. The meaning of <italic>hinnaki</italic> is, be thou free.<sup><xref rid="fn308">56</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>and die in the mount</italic> (Deut. 32:50).<sup><xref rid="fn309">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that the first time Scripture says, <italic>and the priest shall cause her to swear</italic><sup><xref rid="fn310">58</xref></sup> means, and the priest shall cause her to swear by invoking God&#x2019;s name. The second time this phrase is used<sup><xref rid="fn311">59</xref></sup> it means, as Scripture notes,<sup><xref rid="fn312">60</xref></sup> via the curses.</p>
<p>21. THY THIGH&#x2026;THY BELLY. They are the neighbors.<sup><xref rid="fn313">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO SWELL. The word <italic>tzavah</italic> means to swell. The word is not found anywhere else in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn314">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. TO FALL AWAY. The <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>lanpil</italic> (to fall away) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because the <italic>heh</italic> of the form<sup><xref rid="fn315">63</xref></sup> is missing.<sup><xref rid="fn316">64</xref></sup> The same is true of the word <italic>lashmid</italic> (to destroy) (Is. 23:11).<sup><xref rid="fn317">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>AMEN, AMEN. The word amen is repeated for emphasis.<sup><xref rid="fn318">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. [IN A SCROLL.] They had a specific scroll for curses.<sup><xref rid="fn319">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. THE MEMORIAL-PART THEREOF.<sup><xref rid="fn320">68</xref></sup> That which served as her memorial, for good or bad in accordance with her deeds.</p>
<p>27. AND HAVE ACTED UNFAITHFULLY. <italic>Va-timal ma&#x2019;al</italic> (and have acted unfaithfully) is to be understood here as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn321">69</xref></sup> It refers to something covered.<sup><xref rid="fn322">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AND SHALL CONCEIVE SEED. God will give her seed in recompense for the shame which befell her.</p>
<p>31. SHALL BEAR HER INIQUITY. If she was defiled.</p>
<p>Our verse states, <italic>And the man shall be clear from iniquity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn323">71</xref></sup> For if a spirit of jealousy came upon him she is prohibited to him. He is not allowed to he with her.<sup><xref rid="fn324">72</xref></sup> If he sleeps with her, he is guilty of sin.</p>
<p>Some say that the section dealing with the Nazirite follows the section dealing with the wife who is accused of adultery because if the latter was not defiled, then she will have a son who is a Nazirite. However, I believe that the chapter dealing with the Nazirite follows [the chapter dealing with the wife who is accused of adultery] because it lays down the law regarding a female Nazirite who is the reverse of the unfaithful wife. Now wine<sup><xref rid="fn325">73</xref></sup> causes most sins. Furthermore, a woman who does not fix her hair<sup><xref rid="fn326">74</xref></sup> does not seek sexual relations.<sup><xref rid="fn327">75</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn253"><sup>1</sup> Hebrew, <italic>zav</italic>. A <italic>zav</italic> or a <italic>zavah</italic> is a person who has an abnormal discharge from the genital organs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn254"><sup>2</sup> For the uncleanliness of the <italic>zav</italic> and the <italic>zavah</italic>, see Lev. 15:1-28. For the uncleanliness of those who come into contact with the dead, see Num. 19:1- 22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn255"><sup>3</sup> The camp discussed in our chapter, i.e., the camp of the entire people of Israel. I.E. comments thus because one who has a seminal mission is obligated to leave a camp of soldiers who go to war. See Deut. 23:10-14.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn257"><sup>5</sup> As there was in the case of a camp of soldiers. See Deut. 23:10-14.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 6</title>
<p>2. SHALL CLEARLY UTTER A VOW. The word <italic>yafli</italic> means to set aside. On the other hand, it might mean doing something out of the ordinary,<sup><xref rid="fn328">1</xref></sup> for most people follow their lusts.<sup><xref rid="fn329">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE VOW OF A NAZIRITE. <italic>Neder nazir</italic> means an oath to be a Nazirite, for the word <italic>nazir</italic> (Nazirite) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn330">3</xref></sup> The word <italic>ve-yenazeru</italic> (that they separate) (Lev. 22:13) is related to it.</p>
<p>[TO CONSECRATE HIMSELF UNTO THE LORD.]<sup><xref rid="fn331">4</xref></sup> To distance himself from lust. He does this in order to serve God, for wine destroys reason and the proper service of God.<sup><xref rid="fn332">5</xref></sup> I will hint at a secret in the chapter that opens with <italic>When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies</italic> (Deut. 23:10).</p>
<p>3. [HE SHALL ABSTAIN FROM WINE AND STRONG DRINK.] Its meaning is, if he took a vow to be a Nazirite and holy, then he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink.</p>
<p>According to the transmitters of tradition, <italic>shekhar</italic> (strong drink) is aged wine.<sup><xref rid="fn333">6</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>shekhar</italic> is to be taken literally; it refers to any drink that intoxicates a person.</p>
<p>[HE SHALL DRINK NO VINEGAR OF WINE&#x2026;NEITHER SHALL HE DRINK ANY LIQUOR OF GRAPES, NOR EAT FRESH GRAPES.] This explains the oath.<sup><xref rid="fn334">7</xref></sup> He must distance himself from anything connected to wine.<sup><xref rid="fn335">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the account of the wife of Manoah,<sup><xref rid="fn336">9</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>and eat not any unclean thing</italic> (Jud. 13:7). <italic>She</italic><sup><xref rid="fn337">10</xref></sup> <italic>may not eat of any thing that cometh of the grape-vine</italic> (Jud. 13:14).</p>
<p>LIQUOR OF. The word <italic>mishrat</italic> (liquor of) is not found elsewhere in Scripture. The <italic>tav</italic> indicates that the word is feminine and is in the construct. <italic>Mishrat anavim</italic> refers to anything that has been mashed with grapes. Others say that <italic>mishrat anavim</italic> refers to a cooked drink.<sup><xref rid="fn338">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. PRESSED GRAPES. The word <italic>chartzannim</italic> (pressed grapes) is not found anywhere else in Scripture. The same applies to the word <italic>zag</italic> (grape-stone). The commentaries tells us that <italic>chartzannim</italic> refers to the outer skin of the grape and <italic>zag</italic> to the pits. Others say the reverse.<sup><xref rid="fn339">12</xref></sup> According to these interpretations, <italic>me-chartzannim</italic> (from the pressed grapes)<sup><xref rid="fn340">13</xref></sup> is connected to <italic>nothing that is made of the grape-vine</italic>. The meaning of our verse is that the Nazirite shall eat nothing made from the grapevine, that is, from these two things.<sup><xref rid="fn341">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. HE SHALL LET THE LOCKS OF THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD GROW LONG. The word <italic>gaddel</italic> (grow) is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn342">15</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>gaddel</italic> is, he shall grow.</p>
<p>6. THAT HE CONSECRATETH. The word <italic>hazziro</italic> (that he consecrateth) is a <italic>hifil</italic> infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn343">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>A DEAD BODY.<sup><xref rid="fn344">17</xref></sup> The word <italic>met</italic> (dead) is an adjective describing body (<italic>nefesh</italic>). On the other hand, the word <italic>guf</italic> (body) is missing from our text.<sup><xref rid="fn345">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. FOR HIS FATHER, OR FOR HIS MOTHER. And certainly not for his wife, his daughter, and others.</p>
<p>Some say that the word <italic>nazir</italic> (Nazirite) is related to the word <italic>nezer</italic> (crown). <italic>Because his consecration</italic> (nezer) <italic>unto God is upon his head</italic><sup><xref rid="fn346">19</xref></sup> is proof of this. This interpretation is not farfetched.<sup><xref rid="fn347">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that most people are slaves to worldly lusts. The true king, the one who has a crown, the one who wears the royal diadem, is the person who is free from this lust.<sup><xref rid="fn348">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. VERY SUDDENLY. The words <italic>peta</italic> and <italic>pitom</italic><sup><xref rid="fn349">22</xref></sup> are close in meaning. The same applies to <italic>admat afar</italic> (dust of the earth) (Dan. 12:2).<sup><xref rid="fn350">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE DEFILE. The corpse will defile him.<sup><xref rid="fn351">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE DAY OF HIS CLEANSING. By the waters of purification,<sup><xref rid="fn352">25</xref></sup> for he was defiled by a corpse.<sup><xref rid="fn353">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. ONE FOR A SIN-OFFERING AND THE OTHER FOR A BURNT-OFFERING. Its secret was explained by the sages. They said that the reward of sin is sin.<sup><xref rid="fn354">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THAT HE SINNED BY REASON OF THE BODY.<sup><xref rid="fn355">28</xref></sup> The reference is to a dead body. Compare the word <italic>nefesh</italic> (body) in <italic>Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for a body</italic> (Lev. 19:28).<sup><xref rid="fn356">29</xref></sup> If the sin referred to a sin committed against his very own body,<sup><xref rid="fn357">30</xref></sup> then Scripture would not command him to return to his sin.<sup><xref rid="fn358">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND HE SHALL CONSECRATE UNTO THE LORD THE DAYS OF HIS NAZIRITESHIP. All the days that he vowed to be a Nazirite. He shall now begin to count them.<sup><xref rid="fn359">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>BECAUSE HIS CONSECRATION WAS DEFILED. For he vowed to be a Nazirite for a fixed number of days in succession without anything intervening and breaking them up.</p>
<p>13. FULFILLED. <italic>Melot</italic> (fulfilled) is an infinitive. Its final root letter is an <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn360">33</xref></sup> It is conjugated like a word that has a <italic>heh</italic> as a final root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn361">34</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>kero&#x2019;ot</italic> (call)<sup><xref rid="fn362">35</xref></sup> in <italic>that thou didst call us</italic> (Jud. 8:1).</p>
<p>HE SHALL BRING IT.<sup><xref rid="fn363">36</xref></sup> <italic>Yavi oto</italic> (he shall bring it) means he<sup><xref rid="fn364">37</xref></sup> shall bring himself.<sup><xref rid="fn365">38</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>but the shepherds fed themselves</italic> (Ezek. 34:8).<sup><xref rid="fn366">39</xref></sup> Or <italic>yavi oto</italic> means that the <italic>kohen</italic> shall bring him<sup><xref rid="fn367">40</xref></sup> against his will by commanding that he be forced to bring his sacrifice.</p>
<p>14. ONE HE-LAMB. A male, as is the law regarding all burnt offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn368">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>ONE EWE-LAMB. A female, as is the law with all sin offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn369">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ONE RAM&#x2026;FOR PEACE-OFFERINGS. As an expression of joy that he fulfilled his vow.</p>
<p>16. HIS SIN-OFFERING. The sin offering is mentioned first<sup><xref rid="fn370">43</xref></sup> because it was mentioned last,<sup><xref rid="fn371">44</xref></sup> for this is Hebrew style.</p>
<p>18. THE HAIR OF. The Hebrew word for <italic>hair of</italic> is vocalized in two ways.<sup><xref rid="fn372">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. WHEN IT IS SODDEN. The meaning of <italic>beshelah</italic> (when it is sodden) is, and it<sup><xref rid="fn373">46</xref></sup> is sodden.<sup><xref rid="fn374">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>AFTER HE HATH SHAVEN HIS CONSECRATED HEAD. This is a sign that the <italic>kodesh hu</italic> (this is holy) (v. 20) refers to the word <italic>shoulder</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn375">48</xref></sup> for that is the main organ that is being waved. On the other hand, the word <italic>hu</italic> (this)<sup><xref rid="fn376">49</xref></sup> may refer to all that is waved.<sup><xref rid="fn377">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>[21. BESIDE THAT FOR WHICH HIS MEANS SUFFICE.] It means that he is obligated to give in accordance with his wealth. He is also obligated to give in accordance with the days of his vow, whether they are few or whether they are many.<sup><xref rid="fn378">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>The chapter dealing with the blessings of the <italic>kohanim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn379">52</xref></sup> follows the chapter dealing with the Nazirite because, after concluding the laws of the Nazirite who is holy, Scripture mentions the laws of the <italic>kohanim</italic> who are holy.</p>
<p>Those who contradict Rabbinic tradition<sup><xref rid="fn380">53</xref></sup> say that the <italic>kohen</italic> used this blessing to bless all who brought a gift. They claim that the blessing of the <italic>kohanim</italic> follows the law of the Nazirite because the latter concludes with &#x201C;beside that which the means of the celebrant suffice.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn381">54</xref></sup> However, the truth is in keeping with the tradition of our sages of blessed memory.<sup><xref rid="fn382">55</xref></sup> <italic>And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them</italic> (Lev. 9:22)<sup><xref rid="fn383">56</xref></sup> on the eighth day<sup><xref rid="fn384">57</xref></sup> is proof of this. This portion<sup><xref rid="fn385">58</xref></sup> was written because God commanded Aaron to bless the people when the tabernacle was erected. Scripture there<sup><xref rid="fn386">59</xref></sup> mentions, <italic>nesi&#x2019;at kappayim</italic> (the lifting of the hands),<sup><xref rid="fn387">60</xref></sup> for the word <italic>kappayim</italic> means the same as <italic>yadayim</italic> (hands).<sup><xref rid="fn388">61</xref></sup> However, the term <italic>yadayim</italic> is a more general term.<sup><xref rid="fn389">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. THE LORD BLESS THEE. The Lord increase your life and your wealth.<sup><xref rid="fn390">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND KEEP THEE. God will protect what he has increased so that no one steals it.</p>
<p>25. THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE TO SHINE UPON THEE. Its meaning is the same as <italic>In the light of the king&#x2019;s countenance is life</italic> (Prov. 16:15). It means may God make his face to shine upon you when you ask something of Him and at the time that you make the request. May God accept you and may His will be to immediately fulfill your request.</p>
<p>[AND BE GRACIOUS TO THEE.] If you make a request of God in a time of trouble, may He be gracious to you. <italic>Ve-yechunekka</italic> (and be gracious to thee) is similar to <italic>channuni</italic> (have pity) in <italic>have pity upon me, O ye</italic> (Job. 19:21) and <italic>chanan</italic> (graciously given) in <italic>The children whom God hath graciously given</italic> (Gen. 33:5).<sup><xref rid="fn391">64</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-yechunekka</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>chanan</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn392">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. THE LORD LIFT UP HIS COUNTENANCE UPON THEE. The reverse of <italic>I will hide Mine eyes from you</italic> (Is. 1:15). As I have already explained,<sup><xref rid="fn393">66</xref></sup> its meaning is, wherever you go My face shall be lifted up to you.</p>
<p>AND GIVE THEE PEACE. Its meaning is similar to, <italic>no evil</italic> &#x2014; from stones, from evil animals, from any enemy &#x2014; <italic>touch thee</italic> (Job. 5:19).</p>
<p>27. SO SHALL THEY PUT MY NAME. Its meaning is similar to <italic>to set His name there</italic> (Deut. 14:24),<sup><xref rid="fn394">67</xref></sup> that is, the children of Israel be sanctified by God&#x2019;s name. Or it means that when they shall mention My name over the children of Israel [I will bless them], for God&#x2019;s revered and awe-inspiring name is found in each one of the three verses.<sup><xref rid="fn395">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND I WILL BLESS THEM. It is possible that the <italic>mem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn396">69</xref></sup> of <italic>avarekhem</italic> (I will bless them) refers to the <italic>kohanim</italic> who utter the blessing. It means they will bless Israel, and I will bless those who bless.<sup><xref rid="fn397">70</xref></sup> It is also possible that the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>avarekhem</italic> refers to Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn398">71</xref></sup> Its meaning is, if the <italic>kohanim</italic> bless Israel, then I will bless Israel; that is, I will fulfill the blessing of the <italic>kohanim</italic>. In my opinion, the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>avarekhem</italic> refers to all of them, the <italic>kohanim</italic> and the Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn399">72</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn328"><sup>1</sup> The word <italic>yafli</italic> is related to the word <italic>pele</italic> (wonder).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn329"><sup>2</sup> But this person took an oath to separate himself from the pleasure of drinking. Hence what he did was wondrous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn330"><sup>3</sup> <italic>Nazir</italic> modifies the person who takes the oath, for according to I.E. the meaning of <italic>neder nazir</italic> is to be a Nazirite person. See Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn331"><sup>4</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>le-hazir la-Adonai</italic>. This literally means to separate himself unto the Lord. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn332"><sup>5</sup> Thus <italic>le-nazir la-Adonai</italic> means to separate (himself from wine) in order to serve God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn333"><sup>6</sup> In other words, <italic>shekhar</italic> refers to old wine while <italic>yayin</italic> refers to young wine. See Targum and Rashi.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 7</title>
<p>1. [AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD MADE AN END OF SETTING UP THE TABERNACLE.] Moses made an end to the setting up of the tabernacle after the blessing of the <italic>kohanim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn400">1</xref></sup> as this was how events unfolded.<sup><xref rid="fn401">2</xref></sup> On the day that Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them,<sup><xref rid="fn402">3</xref></sup> the dedication of the tabernacle began.<sup><xref rid="fn403">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The verse <italic>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle</italic> is proof of the words of our sages, that Moses took the tabernacle down, raised it up and took it down again, and erected it again throughout the seven days of dedication to train the <italic>kohanim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn404">5</xref></sup> For the meaning of <italic>and sanctified them</italic> is that he sanctified them [the furniture, the altar, and the vessels] by the sprinkling of the blood<sup><xref rid="fn405">6</xref></sup> during the seven days of dedication.<sup><xref rid="fn406">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE ALTAR AND ALL THE VESSELS THEREOF. This is connected to <italic>on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn407">8</xref></sup> It means that he set the altar up in its place.</p>
<p>AND ALL THE VESSELS THEREOF, AND HAD ANOINTED THEM. With the anointing oil</p>
<p>AND SANCTIFIED THEM. With blood. Scripture mentions the altar because of its dedication.<sup><xref rid="fn408">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. THAT THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL&#x2026;OFFERED. Scripture employs a general term.<sup><xref rid="fn409">10</xref></sup> Its meaning is that they brought their offering to the Lord before the opening of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>3. COVERED. The word <italic>tzav</italic> (covered) here is similar to the word <italic>tzabbim</italic> (Utters) in <italic>and in litters, and upon mules</italic> (Is. 66:20). The reference is to a type of ox that pulls wagons.<sup><xref rid="fn410">11</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>eglot tzav</italic> (covered wagons) refers to a wagon that is overloaded and that <italic>tzav</italic> is connected to the word <italic>tzavah</italic> (swell) (Num. 5:21). However, this is farfetched.</p>
<p>[AND TWELVE OXEN.] I have already explained in my work <italic>moznayim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn411">12</xref></sup> that the <italic>mem</italic> in <italic>shenem asar</italic> (twelve) remains both in the absolute<sup><xref rid="fn412">13</xref></sup> and in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn413">14</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>shenem asar</italic> (twelve) is two (<italic>shenayim</italic>) and ten (<italic>eser</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn414">15</xref></sup> The word <italic>shenem</italic> is connected to <italic>aser</italic> for purposes of brevity. The same applies to <italic>shelosh elleh</italic> (these three) (Ex. 21:11).<sup><xref rid="fn415">16</xref></sup> The phrase <italic>shene asar</italic> (twelve)<sup><xref rid="fn416">17</xref></sup> without the <italic>mem</italic> is an abridged form.<sup><xref rid="fn417">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR EVERY TWO OF THE PRINCES. <italic>Al shene ha-nesi&#x2019;im</italic> means for every two of the princes.<sup><xref rid="fn418">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>[13. AND HIS OFFERING.] Scripture reads, <italic>and his offering</italic> because Scripture had already stated, <italic>And he that presented</italic> [<italic>his offering</italic>] (v. 12). The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-korbano</italic> (and his offering) means, and this was his offering.</p>
<p>Scripture writes with regard to the second day, <italic>hikriv et korbano</italic> (he offered his offering)<sup><xref rid="fn419">20</xref></sup> (v. 18), for this is the style of Scripture. Compare, <italic>And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said: &#x2018;My father</italic>&#x2019; (Gen. 22:7). The word father is repeated because Scripture is being lengthy. <italic>Then spoke the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen</italic> (Esth. 7:5) is also similar.<sup><xref rid="fn420">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture does not mention the term <italic>hikriv</italic> (he presented) with regard to the other princes,<sup><xref rid="fn421">22</xref></sup> for Scripture wanted to be brief. Similarly the term <italic>le-gulgelotam</italic> (by their poles) is used only in the numbering of Reuben<sup><xref rid="fn422">23</xref></sup> and Simeon.<sup><xref rid="fn423">24</xref></sup> There are many such examples.<sup><xref rid="fn424">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>48. ON THE SEVENTH DAY. Some say that Elishama the son of Ammihud presented his offering on the Sabbath. It was a ruling for that time.<sup><xref rid="fn425">26</xref></sup> Others say that the reference is to the seventh day of the dedication of the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn426">27</xref></sup> Those who disagree with our sages say that the first day of the altar&#x2019;s dedication did not fall on the first day of the week.<sup><xref rid="fn427">28</xref></sup> However, this is of no avail, for it is impossible that there be no Sabbath in twelve days.</p>
<p>I believe that the second interpretation<sup><xref rid="fn428">29</xref></sup> is correct, because of the peace offering.<sup><xref rid="fn429">30</xref></sup> The seventh day of the circling of Jericho is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn430">31</xref></sup> Likewise the seven days of the dedication of the temple (I Kings 8:65) because of the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn431">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>51. ONE YOUNG BULLOCK. <italic>Ben bakar</italic> means a young bullock. Compare, <italic>ben yonah</italic> (young dove).<sup><xref rid="fn432">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>53. TWO OXEN. These were also male bullocks.<sup><xref rid="fn433">34</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>bakar</italic> (oxen) is, from the kind of cattle.<sup><xref rid="fn434">35</xref></sup> <italic>And all the oxen for the sacrifice of peace-offerings twenty and four bullocks</italic> (v. 88) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn435">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>72. ON THE ELEVENTH DAY. I have already explained in my work <italic>moznayim</italic> why this number<sup><xref rid="fn436">37</xref></sup> differs [from the other numbers].<sup><xref rid="fn437">38</xref></sup> The word <italic>ashte</italic> in (<italic>ashte asar</italic>, eleven) is similar to the word <italic>eshtonotav</italic> (his thoughts) (Ps. 146:4). It (<italic>ashte</italic>) refers to that which a person&#x2019;s thoughts give birth to. The number ten, as it were begets [eleven, etc.]. This is a great secret.<sup><xref rid="fn438">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jonah the Sephardi<sup><xref rid="fn439">40</xref></sup> says that <italic>ashte asar</italic> is short for <italic>al shete asar</italic>. Its meaning is, the number that precedes twelve.<sup><xref rid="fn440">41</xref></sup> Now Rabbi Jonah made two great mistakes. One, contrary to his words, the number twelve is beyond (<italic>al</italic>) the number eleven.<sup><xref rid="fn441">42</xref></sup> <italic>From twenty years old and upward</italic> (va-ma&#x2019;alah) (Num. 1:3) is proof of the aforementioned.<sup><xref rid="fn442">43</xref></sup> His second mistake is that if the word <italic>ashte</italic> is short for <italic>al shete</italic>, then the text should have read <italic>ashne asar</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn443">44</xref></sup> not <italic>ashte asar</italic>. For <italic>ashte</italic> is in the feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn444">45</xref></sup> <italic>Ashte</italic> is therefore one word.</p>
<p>89. [AND WHEN MOSES WENT IN.] It is likely that the beginning of God&#x2019;s word to Moses [in the tabernacle], which is what <italic>And the Lord called unto Moses</italic> (Lev. 1:1) refers to, was uttered when the dedication of the tabernacle was completed.</p>
<p>All the grammarians say that the word <italic>middabber</italic> (speaking) in <italic>speaking unto him</italic> is a <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic><sup><xref rid="fn445">46</xref></sup> with the <italic>tav</italic> swallowed.<sup><xref rid="fn446">47</xref></sup> However, in my opinion <italic>middadbber</italic> is an infinitive. It is similar to the word <italic>dabber</italic> (speak)<sup><xref rid="fn447">48</xref></sup> in <italic>behold, I cannot speak</italic> (Jer. 1:5). The <italic>mem</italic> prefixed to <italic>middabber</italic> is in place of the word <italic>min</italic>, as is the rule in the Hebrew language.<sup><xref rid="fn448">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>va-yishma</italic> (then he heard) is that only Moses heard the voice. Anyone in the tent of meeting outside of the curtain did not hear the voice. The following is also correct: God made Moses&#x2019; ear supersensitive<sup><xref rid="fn449">50</xref></sup> as he added to the sight of Elisha&#x2019;s young man (II Kings 6:17). Similarly <italic>Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam</italic> (Num. 22:31).<sup><xref rid="fn450">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE SPOKE UNTO HIM. This was the way God&#x2019;s word always came to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn451">52</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn400"><sup>1</sup> After the <italic>kohanim</italic> blessed Israel. See Num. 6:24-26; Lev. 9:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn401"><sup>2</sup> Chapter 7 follows the blessing of the <italic>kohanim</italic> at the end of chapter 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn402"><sup>3</sup> Lev. 9:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn403"><sup>4</sup> Our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn404"><sup>5</sup> According to the rabbis, <italic>had made an end of setting up the tabernacle</italic> indicates that the tabernacle had been set up and taken down a number of times. See I.E. on Ex. 40:2 and the notes thereto (Vol. 2, p. 754). It should be noted that I.E. there rejects the opinion that Moses erected and took down the tabernacle during the seven days of dedication.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn405"><sup>6</sup> See Ex. 29:21; Ex. 29:35-7; Lev. 8:30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn406"><sup>7</sup> When the tabernacle was set up and taken down.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn407"><sup>8</sup> In other words, <italic>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle</italic> also applies to <italic>and the altar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn408"><sup>9</sup> <italic>Prima facie</italic>, the altar is included in <italic>the furniture thereof</italic>. Hence I.E. points out the altar is singled out for special mention because it had a special dedication.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn409"><sup>10</sup> Our verse tells us in general terms that the princes brought an offering. Unlike the offerings brought by the princes when the altar was dedicated (verses 12-83), Scripture does not list the offerings prince by prince.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn410"><sup>11</sup> According to this interpretation, here <italic>eglot tzav</italic> (covered wagons) means wagons pulled by a <italic>tzav</italic>. This commentary renders Is. 66:20, <italic>and upon oxen and mules</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn411"><sup>12</sup> A work on grammar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn412"><sup>13</sup> That is, in the word two (<italic>shenayim</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn413"><sup>14</sup> In the phrase <italic>shenem asar</italic> (twelve). When a word ending in a <italic>mem</italic> is connected to another word, the <italic>mem</italic> is dropped. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn414"><sup>15</sup> In other words, <italic>shenem asar</italic> is short for <italic>shenayim ve-asar</italic>, Hence the change in the vowel, <italic>shenem</italic> rather than <italic>shenayim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn415"><sup>16</sup> <italic>Shelosh</italic> is in the construct with <italic>elleh</italic>. Otherwise the phrase would be written <italic>shalosh elleh</italic>. See I.E. on Ex. 21:11 (Vol. 2, p. 464).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn416"><sup>17</sup> This is the form used in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn417"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Shene asar</italic> is short for <italic>shenem asar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn418"><sup>19</sup> The word <italic>al</italic> usually means on. I.E. points out that here it means for.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn419"><sup>20</sup> Translated literally. J.P.S. renders, <italic>he presented for his offering</italic>. There is no reason to say he offered his offering. Scripture should have read, he offered.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn420"><sup>21</sup> Here too Scripture employs a lengthy style (<italic>said</italic> and <italic>spoke</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn421"><sup>22</sup> It is used only in regard to the offering of Nethanel the son of Zuar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn422"><sup>23</sup> Num. 1:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn423"><sup>24</sup> Num. 1:22. Also see I.E. on 1:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn424"><sup>25</sup> Where Scripture employs an abbreviated style.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn425"><sup>26</sup> For personal offerings cannot be offered on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn426"><sup>27</sup> According to this interpretation, the Sabbath day is not included in the days of dedication, for no sacrifice was offered on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn427"><sup>28</sup> Hence the seventh day of dedication did not fall on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn428"><sup>29</sup> That the seventh day refers to the seventh day of dedication, not to the seventh day of the week.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn429"><sup>30</sup> Brought by Elishama. Peace offerings were not brought on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn430"><sup>31</sup> See Josh. 6:6-15. According to I.E. the seventh day on which the Israelites circled Jericho was not a Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn431"><sup>32</sup> The second series of seven days of the dedication of the first temple apparently took in the Day of Atonement. Now if this is the case, then the people ate on Yom Kippur. This is the opinion of the sages of the Talmud. According to I.E. these seven days do not include Yom Kippur, for there were no dedication festivities on that day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn432"><sup>33</sup> See Lev. 1:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn433"><sup>34</sup> They were of the same sex and kind as the young bullock.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn434"><sup>35</sup> Thus <italic>bakar shenayim</italic> (two oxen) literally means two of the kind of cattle, the reference being to two bulls.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn435"><sup>36</sup> That <italic>bakar</italic> refers to bullocks.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn436"><sup>37</sup> <italic>Ashte asar</italic> (eleven).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn437"><sup>38</sup> All the other teens are written by adding the one number to ten. For example, 12 is written <italic>shenem</italic> (2) <italic>asar</italic>; 13, <italic>sheloshah</italic> (3) <italic>asar</italic> (10); etc. However, the word for eleven in our verse is <italic>ashte asar</italic> and not <italic>ahad</italic> (1) <italic>asar</italic> (10).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn438"><sup>39</sup> According to I.E., &#x201C;Ten is the foundation of all sums, for all sums that follow ten are made up of a part or parts of ten, or come into being by doubling ten, multiplying ten, or a combination of the two&#x201D; (<italic>The Secret of the Torah</italic>, p. 163).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn439"><sup>40</sup> Jonah ibn Janach, the eleventh-century grammarian.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn440"><sup>41</sup> In other words, <italic>ashte asar</italic> means eleven.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441"><sup>42</sup> In other words, the word <italic>al</italic> means above, not before. Hence if <italic>ashte asar</italic> is short for <italic>al shetem asar</italic>, then its meaning is, not before 12 but beyond 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn442"><sup>43</sup> <italic>Va-ma&#x2019;alah</italic> and <italic>al</italic> come from the same root. We thus see that <italic>al</italic> means upward or beyond, not before.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn443"><sup>44</sup> Because the word for 12 is <italic>shenem asar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn444"><sup>45</sup> According to Rabbi Jonah, <italic>ashte</italic> is short for <italic>shetem asar</italic>. <italic>Shetem asar</italic> is feminine. Now <italic>yom</italic> is masculine. Why would Scripture employ a feminine?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn445"><sup>46</sup> So too Rashi.</ftnote>

<p>IN FRONT OF THE CANDLESTICK. This explains <italic>to give light</italic> (he&#x2019;ir) <italic>over against it</italic> (Ex. 25:37).<sup><xref rid="fn453">2</xref></sup> Now the word <italic>he&#x2019;ir</italic> (give light)<sup><xref rid="fn454">3</xref></sup> is transitive. It is similar to the word <italic>ta&#x2019;ir</italic> (dost light) in <italic>For Thou dost light my light</italic> (Ps. 18:29). However, this is not the case with the word <italic>ya&#x2019;iru</italic> (shall give light)<sup><xref rid="fn455">4</xref></sup> and the word <italic>he&#x2019;irah</italic> (did shine) in <italic>and the earth did shine</italic> (Ezek. 43:2).</p>
<p>This section<sup><xref rid="fn456">5</xref></sup> follows<sup><xref rid="fn457">6</xref></sup> in order to teach that God&#x2019;s word also came at night, for the light was to burn in the tabernacle and was not to be extinguished.</p>

<p>BEATEN. I have already explained the meaning of <italic>mikshah</italic> (beaten).<sup><xref rid="fn459">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE BASE THEREOF. This refers to the shaft upon which it stood,<sup><xref rid="fn460">9</xref></sup> for Scripture explicitly states, <italic>its base, and its shaft</italic> (Ex. 25:31).</p>
<p>THE FLOWERS THEREOF. The meaning of the word <italic>pirchah</italic> (flowers thereof) is well known.<sup><xref rid="fn461">10</xref></sup> If God had not shown Moses the menorah in a prophetic vision, then no wise craftsman would have had the ability to make the menorah described in Scripture.</p>
<p>SO HE MADE. This refers to Moses. The meaning of <italic>made</italic> is, made by command.<sup><xref rid="fn462">11</xref></sup> The same applies to <italic>And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold</italic> (Ex. 25:31).</p>
<p>The section dealing with the Levites follows the one dealing with the lighting of the menorah to teach us that Aaron shall occupy himself with the kindling of the lamps.<sup><xref rid="fn463">12</xref></sup> However, the Levites shall assist him in the other services and shall stand before him to do all that he commands.<sup><xref rid="fn464">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. TAKE THE LEVITES FROM AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. For they were mixed in.<sup><xref rid="fn465">14</xref></sup> The same was true of all the tribes before they journeyed on from Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn466">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THE WATER OF PURIFICATION. <italic>Chattat</italic> (purification)<sup><xref rid="fn467">16</xref></sup> here is similar to the word <italic>techatteni</italic> (purify me) (Ps. 51:9).<sup><xref rid="fn468">17</xref></sup> Or it is possible that the <italic>me chattat</italic> (the water of purification) was similar to a sin offering (<italic>korban chattat</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn469">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>SPRINKLE&#x2026;UPON THEM. Rabbi Moses<sup><xref rid="fn470">19</xref></sup> says that the first root letter of <italic>hazzeh</italic> (sprinkle) is a <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn471">20</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>hakkeh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn472">21</xref></sup> <italic>takkeh</italic> (thou shalt surely smite) (Deut. 13:16). Rabbi Moses is correct.</p>
<p>AND LET THEM CAUSE A RAZOR TO PASS OVER ALL THEIR FLESH. Its meaning is, and they have already caused a razor to pass over their flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn473">22</xref></sup> The sages said<sup><xref rid="fn474">23</xref></sup> even the beard,<sup><xref rid="fn475">24</xref></sup> but not the corner of the beard.<sup><xref rid="fn476">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND LET THEM WASH THEIR CLOTHES. And after this<sup><xref rid="fn477">26</xref></sup> they will be cleansed, being purified by the waters of purification.</p>
<p>[AND CLEANSE THEMSELVES.] The word <italic>ve-hitteharu</italic> (and cleanse themselves) is a <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn478">27</xref></sup> The <italic>tav</italic> of the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic> is swallowed.<sup><xref rid="fn479">28</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ha-mitkaddeshim ve-ha-mittaharim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn480">29</xref></sup> (They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves) (Is. 66:17).</p>
<p>8. A YOUNG BULLOCK. The term <italic>ben bakar</italic> indicates a young bullock.<sup><xref rid="fn481">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>FINE FLOUR. Three-tenth parts (of an <italic>efah</italic>) as is the law.</p>
<p>SHALT THOU TAKE. By issuing a command, for the Levites shall take.<sup><xref rid="fn482">31</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>Then let them take</italic> (ve-lakechu) is, then let them give.<sup><xref rid="fn483">32</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ve-yikechu li terumah</italic> (that they take for Me an offering).<sup><xref rid="fn484">33</xref></sup> On the other hand, the meaning of <italic>Then let them take</italic> might be that they shall take with them.<sup><xref rid="fn485">34</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>they shall take</italic> (ve-yikechu) <italic>to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers&#x2019; houses</italic> (Ex. 12:3).</p>
<p>11. BEFORE THE LORD. Its meaning is, when you present the Levites before the tent, the Levites shall lay their hands upon the head of each one of the bullocks.<sup><xref rid="fn486">35</xref></sup> There are many similar instances in Scripture.</p>
<p>12. AND OFFER THOU. Offer by command, for Aaron was the celebrant. Scripture&#x2019;s statement that the sin offering and also the burnt offering were to make atonement for the Levites is true proof of the aforementioned.<sup><xref rid="fn487">36</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>and Aaron made an atonement for them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn488">37</xref></sup> (v. 21).</p>
<p>[13. AND THOU SHALT SET THE LEVITES BEFORE AARON.] After Aaron shall make atonement for the Levites, you shall set them up before Aaron, and Aaron shall offer them for a wave offering.</p>
<p>AND OFFER THEM FOR A WAVE-OFFERING. Via your command. Compare, <italic>And offer thou</italic> (v. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn489">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THE LEVITES SHALL BE MINE. This is a great status.<sup><xref rid="fn490">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND AFTER THAT SHALL THE LEVITES GO IN. After you purify them.</p>
<p>AND OFFER THEM. Via your command.</p>
<p>16. FOR THEY ARE WHOLLY GIVEN UNTO ME. They, and their children, are given unto Me.<sup><xref rid="fn491">40</xref></sup> The Israelites gave them to Me<sup><xref rid="fn492">41</xref></sup> <italic>and I took them unto Me</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn493">42</xref></sup> that is, I accepted them. Why are they given [unto Me]?<sup><xref rid="fn494">43</xref></sup> In order to redeem all that openeth the womb.</p>
<p>The word <italic>pitrat</italic> (openeth) and <italic>peter</italic> (openeth)<sup><xref rid="fn495">44</xref></sup> are two different words.<sup><xref rid="fn496">45</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>tzedek</italic> (righteousness) and <italic>tzedakah</italic> (righteousness).<sup><xref rid="fn497">46</xref></sup> Or they might be the same word in two paradigms.<sup><xref rid="fn498">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. ON THE DAY THAT I SMOTE. The word <italic>yom</italic> (day)<sup><xref rid="fn499">48</xref></sup> means time.<sup><xref rid="fn500">49</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Thou art this day</italic> (yom) <italic>to pass over</italic> (Deut. 2:18).<sup><xref rid="fn501">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. [AND I HAVE TAKEN THE LEVITES.] Scripture has already stated, <italic>have I taken them unto Me</italic> (v. 16). This is the style of Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn502">51</xref></sup> <italic>And I have taken the Levites</italic> is connected to the verse which follows. It means, when I took the Levites, I gave them to Aaron and his sons (v. 19).</p>
<p>19. AND TO MAKE ATONEMENT. To be an atonement for the souls of the children of Israel, as I have already explained.<sup><xref rid="fn503">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. THUS DID MOSES AND AARON. Moses by command, Aaron by waving them, and Israel by the laying of their hands on them.</p>
<p>21. [AND THE LEVITES PURIFIED THEMSELVES.] Scripture tells us that they also performed [purification rituals].</p>
<p>AND AARON MADE ATONEMENT FOR THEM. And Aaron had already made atonement for them.<sup><xref rid="fn504">53</xref></sup> Others say that the Levites first purified themselves and afterwards laid their hands on the bullocks.<sup><xref rid="fn505">54</xref></sup> This interpretation is not far off the mark.<sup><xref rid="fn506">55</xref></sup> If this is so, then the meaning of <italic>And thou shalt set the Levites</italic> (v. 13) is: and you have already set the Levites<sup><xref rid="fn507">56</xref></sup> at the beginning.<sup><xref rid="fn508">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. SO DID THEY UNTO THEM. So did the sons of Aaron always unto the children of the Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn509">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. THIS IS THAT WHICH PERTAINETH UNTO THE LEVITES. Its meaning is, this is the set time of service which pertains to the Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn510">59</xref></sup> The verse reading <italic>from thirty years and upward</italic> (Num. 4:23)<sup><xref rid="fn511">60</xref></sup> does not contradict our verse,<sup><xref rid="fn512">61</xref></sup> for <italic>from thirty years and upward</italic> refers to the service of bearing burdens (Num. 4:24), while our verse, which reads <italic>from twenty and five years all and upward</italic>, refers to the service in the work of the tent of meeting. The meaning of <italic>li-tzeva</italic> (to perform the service) is, to be counted among the host of workers.<sup><xref rid="fn513">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. TO KEEP THE CHARGE. This command is directed to the elders.<sup><xref rid="fn514">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>The section dealing with the Passover follows the section dealing with the consecration of the Levites because the dedication of the altar took place in the first month.<sup><xref rid="fn515">64</xref></sup> The Levites were separated<sup><xref rid="fn516">65</xref></sup> at that time.<sup><xref rid="fn517">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>The section dealing with Passover<sup><xref rid="fn518">67</xref></sup> is written here because, concerning the Passover, it was written, <italic>And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land</italic> (Ex. 12:25); <italic>And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land</italic> (Ex. 13:5).<sup><xref rid="fn519">68</xref></sup> This chapter<sup><xref rid="fn520">69</xref></sup> records that God commanded that they were obligated to offer the Passover sacrifice in the desert also.<sup><xref rid="fn521">70</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn452"><sup>1</sup> See Ex. 27:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn453"><sup>2</sup> In other words, the meaning of <italic>to give light over against it</italic> is, shall give light in front of the candlestick.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn454"><sup>3</sup> In Ex. 25:37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn455"><sup>4</sup> In our verse. According to I.E., <italic>ya&#x2019;iru</italic> (shall give light) is intransitive and means shall shine, not shall shine upon. I.E. renders our clause, <italic>shall shine in front of the candlestick</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn456"><sup>5</sup> Verses 1-4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn457"><sup>6</sup> The statement telling us that God spoke to Moses in the tent of meeting.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn458"><sup>7</sup> Scripture describes the menorah because it was a unique work of art. The menorah had already been described in Ex. 25:31-40. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn459"><sup>8</sup> &#x201C;<italic>Mikshah</italic> means equal&#x201D; (I.E. on Ex. 25:31, Vol. 2, p. 547). According to I.E. the various parts of the menorah were of equal size.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn460"><sup>9</sup> The shaft, to which the menorah&#x2019;s branches were attached.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn461"><sup>10</sup> Hence there is no reason to explain it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn462"><sup>11</sup> Moses commanded a craftsman to make the menorah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn463"><sup>12</sup> By himself, as stated in verse 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn464"><sup>13</sup> See verse 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn465"><sup>14</sup> They were living among the children of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn466"><sup>15</sup> Before the standards were set up, the various tribes were intermingled.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn467"><sup>16</sup> The word <italic>chattat</italic> usually means sin. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn468"><sup>17</sup> Translated according to I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn469"><sup>18</sup> In this case, <italic>me chattat</italic> (the water of purification) means sin water, water which serves as a sin offering. In other words, the water atones for sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn470"><sup>19</sup> Moses ibn Gikatilla, an 11th-century Spanish philologist and Bible commentator.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn471"><sup>20</sup> In other words, the root of <italic>hazzeh</italic> is <italic>nun, zayin, heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn472"><sup>21</sup> The root of <italic>hakkeh</italic> (and of <italic>takkeh</italic>) is <italic>nun, kof, heh</italic>. Thus <italic>hazzeh</italic> is like <italic>hakkeh</italic>. They are both in the <italic>hifil</italic> and they both come from a root that opens with a <italic>nun</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn473"><sup>22</sup> In other words, <italic>ve-he&#x2019;eviru</italic> (and let them cause to pass) is a pluperfect. I.E. comments thus because the shaving of the body preceded the sprinkling.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn474"><sup>23</sup> See <italic>Nazir</italic> 40-41.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn475"><sup>24</sup> See Lev. 14:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn476"><sup>25</sup> See Lev. 21:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn477"><sup>26</sup> After they wash their clothes.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn480"><sup>29</sup> <italic>Mittaharim</italic> is in the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic> and does not have a <italic>tav</italic> in it, for its <italic>tav</italic> is swallowed by its <italic>tet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn481"><sup>30</sup> The Hebrew literally reads, a bull (<italic>par</italic>) <italic>ben bakar</italic> (the son of cattle). I.E. points out that this should be interpreted as a bull, a young bovine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn482"><sup>31</sup> Our verse opens by saying, <italic>Then let them</italic> (the Levites) <italic>take a young bullock</italic>. Thus it is the Levites who do the taking.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn483"><sup>32</sup> In other words, <italic>shalt thou take</italic> means shalt thou offer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn484"><sup>33</sup> Literally, that they give (<italic>ve-yikechu</italic>) to Me an offering. We thus see that the Hebrew word <italic>yikkach</italic> (to take) sometimes has the meaning of to give.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn485"><sup>34</sup> In this case, <italic>ve-lakechu</italic> (then let them take) has its usual meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn486"><sup>35</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>al rosh ha-parim</italic> (upon the heads of the bullocks). This literally reads, upon the head of the bullocks. I.E. interprets this to mean upon the head of each one of the bullocks.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn487"><sup>36</sup> That Aaron was the celebrant, for Aaron was the one making atonement offerings (v. 21).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn488"><sup>37</sup> The Levites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn489"><sup>38</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. The <italic>Mikra&#x2019;ot Gedolot</italic> reads, and whatsoever there may be to do with them (Num. 4:26). However, this appears to be an error. See Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn490"><sup>39</sup> In other words, the Levites were elevated to a great status.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn491"><sup>40</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>ki netunim, netunim li</italic> (for they are wholly given unto Me). I.E. believes that the first <italic>netunim</italic> refers to the Levites and the second to the children of the Levites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn492"><sup>41</sup> See verses 9 and 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn493"><sup>42</sup> &#x201C;And I took them unto Me&#x201D; is I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of <italic>have I taken them unto Me</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn494"><sup>43</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. The printed texts apparently read, they are not given (unto me). This is an obvious error.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn495"><sup>44</sup> Our verse refers to the first born as <italic>pitrat&#x2026;&#x1E59;echem</italic> (that openeth the womb). The Book of Exodus refers to the first-born as <italic>peter&#x2026;rechem</italic> (openeth the womb) (Ex. 13:2).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn496"><sup>45</sup> There is a difference in nuance between these two words. However, I.E. does not explain how they differ. For another interpretation, see Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn497"><sup>46</sup> <italic>Tzedek</italic> refers to any act of righteousness. <italic>Tzedakah</italic> in rabbinic literature refers to a gift of charity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn498"><sup>47</sup> In other words, there is no difference between <italic>peter</italic> and <italic>pitrat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn499"><sup>48</sup> Here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn500"><sup>49</sup> The first-born were slain at night. See Ex. 12:29. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn501"><sup>50</sup> The meaning of this is, you are about to pass over, for Israel did not pass over the Jordan until Moses died.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn502"><sup>51</sup> To repeat itself after digressing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn503"><sup>52</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 32:29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn504"><sup>53</sup> Before Aaron offered them as a sacred gift before the Lord. Thus <italic>va-yekhapper</italic> is a pluperfect that means had made atonement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn505"><sup>54</sup> After which Aaron offered them for a wave offering and made atonement for them (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn506"><sup>55</sup> For it is based on a literal interpretation of <italic>va-yekhapper</italic> (and made atonement).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn507"><sup>56</sup> The atonement ritual was the final act in the cleansing ritual of the Levites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn508"><sup>57</sup> That is, before Aaron made atoonement fot them. Thus our verse does not contradict verse 13. In this case, <italic>va-yekhapper</italic> (had atoned) is not a pluperfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn509"><sup>58</sup> The reference is to the commandments in our chapter regarding the Levites (verses 6-14). This apparently applies to future generations as well.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn510"><sup>59</sup> In other words, <italic>zot</italic> (this is) is short for <italic>zot ha-kitzvah</italic> (the set time of service).</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 9</title>
<p>6. BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN MEN. It is impossible for a camp to be big as that of the Israelites without people dying every day.</p>
<p>7. WHEREFORE ARE WE TO BE KEPT BACK. <italic>Niggara</italic> (kept back) is a <italic>nifal</italic>.</p>
<p>8. STAY YE. At the opening of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p>10. IN A JOURNEY AFAR OFF. We do not have to search for the meaning of this phrase, for our sages have already transmitted to us the meaning of <italic>afar off</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn522">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF YOU. This refers to being unclean by reason of a dead body.</p>
<p>OR OF YOUR GENERATIONS. This refers to both a person who is unclean by reason of a dead body and to one in a journey far off.</p>
<p>13. AND IS NOT ON A JOURNEY. <italic>U-ve-derekh</italic> (and on a journey) is to be rendered, or is on a journey.<sup><xref rid="fn523">2</xref></sup> <italic>U-makkeh aviv ve-immo</italic> (and he that smiteth his father, or his mother)<sup><xref rid="fn524">3</xref></sup> (Ex. 21:15) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn525">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL BEAR HIS SIN. He alone.<sup><xref rid="fn526">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND IF A STRANGER SHALL SOJOURN AMONG YOU. He too shall observe the second Passover<sup><xref rid="fn527">6</xref></sup> in accordance with the ordinance. Others say that the reference is to the first Passover.<sup><xref rid="fn528">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND ON THE DAY THAT THE TABERNACLE WAS REARED UP. Scripture begins to count the journeys of Israel. It was thus compelled to make mention of the cloud that rested on the tabernacle, for when it camped they camped and when it journeyed<sup><xref rid="fn529">8</xref></sup> they journeyed.</p>
<p>EVEN THE TENT OF THE TESTIMONY. <italic>Le-ohel</italic> (even the tent) is to be rendered, on the tent.<sup><xref rid="fn530">9</xref></sup> There are many such instances in Scripture.</p>
<p>18. AT THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED. Its meaning is clear, for God caused the cloud to rest and God caused it to journey.</p>
<p>19. AND WHEN THE CLOUD TARRIED. The meaning of <italic>u- ve-ha&#x2019;arikh</italic> (and when it tarried) is to be rendered, and if it tarried.<sup><xref rid="fn531">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture first speaks in general terms.<sup><xref rid="fn532">11</xref></sup> It then goes on to say that sometimes the Israelites would journey for a few days or encamp according to the commandment of the Lord.</p>
<p>21. OR IF IT CONTINUED BY DAY AND BY NIGHT. They thus occasionally journeyed at night.<sup><xref rid="fn533">12</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>yomam va-laylah</italic> (by day and by night) is to be interpreted literally.<sup><xref rid="fn534">13</xref></sup> This interpretation appears correct to me. The term <italic>yomayim</italic> (two days) (v. 22)<sup><xref rid="fn535">14</xref></sup> is proof that this interpretation is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn536">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. OR A YEAR. The word <italic>yomam</italic> means a full year.<sup><xref rid="fn537">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AT THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD THEY ENCAMPED. This is stated at the end of the chapter to indicate that this was the procedure as long as Israel lived in the wilderness.</p>
<ftnote id="fn522"><sup>1</sup> According to the Mishnah, <italic>Pes</italic>. 9:2, <italic>afar off</italic> means outside of the threshold of the temple courtyard. For other opinions see <italic>Pes</italic>. 9:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn523"><sup>2</sup> In other words, the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>u-ve-derekh</italic> is to be rendered &#x201C;or,&#x201D; not &#x201C;and.&#x201D; I.E. comments thus because he believes that the law of being far off did not apply in the wilderness (I.E. on verse 10). Hence he reads our verse as follows: But the man that is unclean in the wilderness, and is on a journey in future generations. So Filwarg. For additional interpretations see Krinsky and Avi Ezri.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn524"><sup>3</sup> Literally, and he that smiteth his father and his mother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn525"><sup>4</sup> In that its meaning is, and he that smiteth his father, or his mother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn526"><sup>5</sup> Not his descendants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn527"><sup>6</sup> If unclean or far off.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn528"><sup>7</sup> The Passover observed in Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn529"><sup>8</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. Our texts read, <italic>when they journeyed, they journeyed</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn530"><sup>9</sup> The <italic>lamed</italic> usually has the meaning of to. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. I.E. renders our verse, the cloud covered the tabernacle, on the tent of the testimony.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn531"><sup>10</sup> Nahmanides interprets similarly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn532"><sup>11</sup> That Israel travelled and camped in the wilderness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn533"><sup>12</sup> This means that <italic>yomam va-laylah</italic> (by day and by night) is to be rendered, by day <italic>or</italic> by night. Our verse reads as follows: or if it (the cloud) continued by day or by night, when the cloud was taken up they journeyed. In other words, sometimes the cloud stayed over the tabernacle during the day and was taken up at the beginning of the night. Thus Israel at times took up their journey at night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn534"><sup>13</sup> In other words, the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>yomam va-laylah</italic> is to be translated literally. Thus <italic>yomam va-laylah</italic> means by day <italic>and</italic> by night. Therefore what the verse is telling us is that the cloud continued on the tabernacle a day and a night and was taken up in the morning, and then Israel journeyed. The verse thus teaches that Israel journeyed in the morning, not at night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn535"><sup>14</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. See also Filwarg. The printed texts have <italic>yomam</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn536"><sup>15</sup> The term <italic>yomayim</italic> follows <italic>yomam va-laylah</italic>. <italic>Yomayim</italic> refers to two days and two nights. Hence <italic>yomam va-laylah</italic> must refer to a day and a night.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 10</title>
<p>2. MAKE THEE TWO TRUMPETS OF SILVER. <italic>Chatzotzerot</italic> (trumpets) is a noun. In its verbal form, one of the <italic>tzadis</italic> is not pronounced even though it is written.<sup><xref rid="fn538">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THE CALLING. <italic>Le-mikra</italic> (for the calling) is an infinitive. The same applies to <italic>u-le-massa</italic> (and for causing to set forward). On the other hand, they might be nouns. In this case, the word <italic>le-mikra</italic> (for the calling) means at the time of calling, and <italic>le-massa</italic> (and for causing to set forward), at the time of journeying.<sup><xref rid="fn539">2</xref></sup> The first interpretation appears correct to me.</p>
<p>3. AND WHEN THEY SHALL BLOW WITH THEM. And when the trumpeters shall blow with them.<sup><xref rid="fn540">3</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>and he said to Joseph</italic><sup><xref rid="fn541">4</xref></sup> (Gen. 48:1) <italic>and whom she bore to Levi</italic> (Num. 26:59).<sup><xref rid="fn542">5</xref></sup> Now its meaning is,<sup><xref rid="fn543">6</xref></sup> if they blow both trumpets,<sup><xref rid="fn544">7</xref></sup> then the princes and the congregation shall gather.<sup><xref rid="fn545">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND IF THEY BLOW BUT WITH ONE. This means if they blow with one trumpet, then the princes alone shall come. If a <italic>tru&#x2019;ah</italic> (an alarm)<sup><xref rid="fn546">9</xref></sup> sounds, then the standard of Judah shall journey, even though the cloud is upon the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn547">10</xref></sup> In the opinion of many, another cloud<sup><xref rid="fn548">11</xref></sup> journeyed before the Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn549">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. THE CAMPS THAT LIE ON THE EAST SIDE SHALL TAKE THEIR JOURNEY. For they consisted of three camps.<sup><xref rid="fn550">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AN ALARM THE SECOND TIME. So that the standard of Reuben will take up its journey. They did not blow the trumpets again,<sup><xref rid="fn551">14</xref></sup> for the family of Kohath and with them the <italic>kohanim</italic> who blew the trumpets journeyed before the standard of Ephraim.<sup><xref rid="fn552">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEY SHALL BLOW AN ALARM FOR THEIR JOURNEYS. The <italic>kohanim</italic> shall blow an alarm for their journeys, for they journeyed after the standard of Reuben.<sup><xref rid="fn553">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND THEY SHALL BE TO YOU FOR A STATUTE FOR EVER. The camps now journeyed to battle.<sup><xref rid="fn554">17</xref></sup> Is this not Moses&#x2019; words<sup><xref rid="fn555">18</xref></sup> when the ark journeyed?<sup><xref rid="fn556">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that Scripture explains this statute.<sup><xref rid="fn557">20</xref></sup> It says that Israel shall do the following: The <italic>kohanim</italic> shall sound the alarm upon trumpets when Israel goes forth to war, to battle in the land of their enemies, and similarly if an enemy enters their land and Israel goes forth to fight them.</p>
<p>9. AND YE SHALL BE REMEMBERED. For you have done what God the glorious commanded you do. The alarm (<italic>tru&#x2019;ah</italic>) also serves as a reminder to the people to cry out to God.<sup><xref rid="fn558">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. ALSO IN THE DAY OF YOUR GLADNESS, AND IN YOUR APPOINTED SEASONS. When you return from the land of your enemies, or you defeat the enemy who attacks you<sup><xref rid="fn559">22</xref></sup> and you establish a day of rejoicing, such as the days of Purim or the seven days of rejoicing in the days of Hezekiah.<sup><xref rid="fn560">23</xref></sup> However, our transmitters of tradition explained that the day of your gladness refers to the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn561">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The trumpets were sounded<sup><xref rid="fn562">25</xref></sup> so that Israel would hear that the burnt offerings were being offered and that they should direct their hearts to God.</p>
<p>11. ON THE TWENTIETH DAY OF THE MONTH. The standards first journeyed on this day. Thus Israel was at Sinai close to a year.<sup><xref rid="fn563">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. BY THEIR STAGES.<sup><xref rid="fn564">27</xref></sup> As it was fit for them to journey.<sup><xref rid="fn565">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE CLOUD ABODE IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN. I will explain this and, <italic>And they took their first journey</italic> (v. 13)<sup><xref rid="fn566">29</xref></sup> later.</p>
<p>17. TAKEN DOWN. The Levites took it down.</p>
<p>21. THE BEARERS OF THE SANCTUARY. The reference is to the ark.</p>
<p>MIGHT BE SET UP. That the Gershonites and the Merarites might set up the tabernacle before the coming of the Kohathites so that the <italic>kohanim</italic> could immediately bring the ark into its place.</p>
<p>25. REARWARD. According to the standards,<sup><xref rid="fn567">30</xref></sup> for Naphtali was last.<sup><xref rid="fn568">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. THUS WERE THE JOURNEYINGS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Its meaning is, thus did they journey all the days that they were in the wilderness.</p>
<p>[29. AND MOSES SAID UNTO HOBAB, THE SON OF REUEL.] We find Scripture telling us that Zipporah was the daughter of Reuel, for it is written, <italic>and he</italic> [Reuel] <italic>gave Moses Zipporah his daughter</italic> (Ex. 2:21). Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>to water their father&#x2019;s flock</italic><sup><xref rid="fn569">32</xref></sup> (Ex. 2:16), <italic>and to Reuel their</italic><sup><xref rid="fn570">33</xref></sup> <italic>father</italic> (Ex. 2:18). Now Hobab was the son of Reuel.<sup><xref rid="fn571">34</xref></sup> Thus Hobab<sup><xref rid="fn572">35</xref></sup> was the brother of Zipporah.<sup><xref rid="fn573">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to a rational analysis of Scripture, Hobab is to be identified with Jethro, because the Torah states, <italic>as thou</italic> [Hobab] <italic>knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness</italic> (v. 31) and it states with regard to Jethro when he came to the wilderness, <italic>into the wilderness where he was encamped</italic> (Ex. 18:5).</p>
<p>Should one disagree<sup><xref rid="fn574">37</xref></sup> and argue that Scripture refers to Jethro as <italic>choten mosheh</italic> (Moses&#x2019; father-in-law) (Ex. 18:1), then one can respond that it is the way of Scripture to refer to the father and the brother of a young woman by the term <italic>choten</italic> (father-in-law).<sup><xref rid="fn575">38</xref></sup> <italic>Unto Hobab, the son of Reuel&#x2026;choten mosheh</italic> (Moses&#x2019; father-in-law)<sup><xref rid="fn576">39</xref></sup> is proof of the aforementioned. For it has already been made clear to you that Hobab was the brother of Zipporah, and Scripture calls him <italic>choten mosheh</italic> (Moses&#x2019; father-in-law). Should one argue that <italic>choten mosheh</italic> (Moses&#x2019; father-in-law) is not connected to Hobab but to Reuel, then the response is, Scripture explicitly states <italic>Hobab choten mosheh</italic> (the father-in-law of Moses) (Jud. 4:11).</p>
<p>Many say that Hobab and Jethro are one and the same. They maintain that Jethro/Hobab was the father of Zipporah and that Reuel was the grandfather of Zipporah. They argue that Scripture says, <italic>to Reuel their father</italic> (Ex. 2:18)<sup><xref rid="fn577">40</xref></sup> in the same manner that Jacob said, <italic>O God of my father Abraham</italic> (Gen. 32:10).<sup><xref rid="fn578">41</xref></sup> Scripture similarly refers to Zipporah as Reuel&#x2019;s daughter in the same manner that it refers to Belshazzar as Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s son,<sup><xref rid="fn579">42</xref></sup> when in fact he was Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s grandson.</p>
<p>Our sages say that Jethro had seven names.<sup><xref rid="fn580">43</xref></sup> There are seventy faces to the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn581">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. TO MINE OWN LAND, AND TO MY KINDRED.<sup><xref rid="fn582">45</xref></sup> Where I was born and where I live unto this very day.<sup><xref rid="fn583">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. LEAVE US NOT, I PRAY THEE. The word <italic>na</italic> (I pray thee) means now. The same applies to the word <italic>na</italic> in all of Scripture. The opposite is the case in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn584">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>FORASMUCH AS THOU KNOWEST. <italic>Ki al ken</italic> (forasmuch) here means the same as <italic>ki al ken</italic> in <italic>forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son</italic> (Gen. 38:26). Since (<italic>ki al ken</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn585">48</xref></sup> you know the place where we encamped, come with us.</p>
<p>AND THOU SHALT BE TO US INSTEAD OF EYES. You will show us the way.<sup><xref rid="fn586">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many say that <italic>ve-hayita</italic> (and thou shalt be) is to be taken as a perfect<sup><xref rid="fn587">50</xref></sup> and alludes to the advice which Jethro gave Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn588">51</xref></sup> He showed Moses what Moses did not know. They say this is what eyes refers to.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>And he said: Leave us not, I pray thee</italic> is, and he had already said to him [leave us not I pray thee]<sup><xref rid="fn589">52</xref></sup> but it was to no avail.<sup><xref rid="fn590">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>[33. AND THEY SET FORWARD FROM THE MOUNT OF THE LORD THREE DAYS&#x2019; JOURNEY.] In my opinion the first journey was unlike the rest of the journeys. The verse which states, <italic>and the Kohathites&#x2026;set forward</italic> (v. 21) after the two standards journeyed refers to all the other journeys except this one, for<sup><xref rid="fn591">54</xref></sup> the ark journeyed before the camp of the Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn592">55</xref></sup> However, this was the case for only three days. This is the meaning of <italic>three days</italic> (v. 33). Similarly, <italic>And they went three days&#x2019; journey in the wilderness of Etham</italic> (Num. 33:8) does not mean that they traveled a three days journey in one day.<sup><xref rid="fn593">56</xref></sup> Others say<sup><xref rid="fn594">57</xref></sup> that they traveled a three-day journey in one day.<sup><xref rid="fn595">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that they traveled a journey of three days corresponding to the journeys when they left Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn596">59</xref></sup> and the ark was a three-day distance from them.<sup><xref rid="fn597">60</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran</italic> (v. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn598">61</xref></sup> They explain that <italic>And they took their first journey</italic> (v. 13), means that they journeyed by the command of Moses, for the cloud traveled immediately.<sup><xref rid="fn599">62</xref></sup> However, this is not so, for Moses did not distance himself from the ark, as proved by <italic>And it came to pass, when the ark set forward</italic> (v. 35) <italic>And when it rested</italic> (v. 36). What I said above appears correct to me.<sup><xref rid="fn600">63</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Paran</italic>, in <italic>and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran</italic> (v. 12), is a general name for Taberah,<sup><xref rid="fn601">64</xref></sup> which is the same as Kibroth-hattaavah (v. 34), Hazeroth (Num. 33:17), Rithmah (Num. 33:18), and many other journeys.<sup><xref rid="fn602">65</xref></sup> The fact that Scripture does not mention the wilderness of Paran in the Torah portion <italic>Elleh Mase</italic> (these are the stages)<sup><xref rid="fn603">66</xref></sup> is proof of this. I will explain this later.<sup><xref rid="fn604">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>according to the commandment of the Lord</italic> (v. 13) is, when the trumpets sounded the alarm.<sup><xref rid="fn605">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. RISE UP, O LORD. As people do when they rise up to battle.</p>
<p>[BE SCATTERED.] When Your enemies see that You arose to do battle, they will immediately be scattered.</p>
<p>[THEM THAT HATE THEE.] The word <italic>mesanekha</italic> (them that hate Thee) is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn606">69</xref></sup> The <italic>nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn607">70</xref></sup> does not receive a <italic>dagesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn608">71</xref></sup> in order to simplify the enunciation of the word.</p>
<p>SCATTERED&#x2026;FLEE. Scripture repeats itself as is its style in all prophecies,<sup><xref rid="fn609">72</xref></sup> as I will explain in the portion dealing with Balaam.<sup><xref rid="fn610">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. AND WHEN IT RESTED. When the ark rested. <italic>U-venucho</italic> (when it rested) is spelled with a <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn611">74</xref></sup> in the same way that the word <italic>oholo</italic> (his tent) (Gen. 13:3) is,<sup><xref rid="fn612">75</xref></sup> for the letters <italic>alef, heh, vav, yod</italic> interchange.<sup><xref rid="fn613">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>RETURN, O LORD. Rabbi Judah, the first grammarian, says that every time the word <italic>shav</italic> in the <italic>kal</italic> conjugation is related in meaning to <italic>teshuvah</italic> (return), it is intransitive, not transitive.<sup><xref rid="fn614">77</xref></sup> However, when it means peace and quiet, as in <italic>in sitting still</italic> (be-shuvah) <italic>and rest shall ye be saved</italic> (Is. 30:15), and similarly in <italic>Return</italic> (shuvah), <italic>O Lord, unto the ten thousands of the families of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn615">78</xref></sup> it means that God will give them rest and they will not be disturbed by any enemy.<sup><xref rid="fn616">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note, the word <italic>revavah</italic> (ten thousand) comes from the same root as the word <italic>rav</italic> (many). <italic>Revavah</italic> in our verse is similar to the word <italic>revavah</italic> (increase) in <italic>I cause thee to increase</italic> (Ezek. 16:7). It is possible that ten thousand is called a <italic>revavah</italic> because it is a great number. The word <italic>revavah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn617">80</xref></sup> is therefore connected to the word <italic>alfe</italic> (thousands).<sup><xref rid="fn618">81</xref></sup> Moses prayed that God would grant rest and quiet to all of Israel, though they be many.</p>
<ftnote id="fn538"><sup>1</sup> See <italic>machtzerim</italic> (did blow) in I Chron. 15:24. <italic>Machtzerim</italic> is spelled with two <italic>tzadis</italic>. However, only one of them is pronounced.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 11</title>
<p>1. AND THE PEOPLE. This chapter is connected to the one before,<sup><xref rid="fn619">1</xref></sup> because the Israelites camped in <italic>kibroth-hatta&#x2019;avah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn620">2</xref></sup> after the ark journeyed from Sinai. Scripture now tells what happened there.<sup><xref rid="fn621">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>AS MURMURERS. <italic>Mitonenim</italic> (murmurers) is related to the word <italic>aven</italic> (evil).<sup><xref rid="fn622">4</xref></sup> <italic>Onekh</italic> (evil) in <italic>thy evil</italic> (onekh) <italic>thoughts</italic> (Jer. 4:14) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn623">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND WHEN THE LORD HEARD.] The meaning of <italic>when the Lord heard</italic> is, and when the Lord heard that they spoke evil.</p>
<p>AND DEVOURED. <italic>Va-tokhal</italic> (and devoured) is penultimately accented. Compare, <italic>va-yomer</italic> (and he said) (Gen. 14:19).<sup><xref rid="fn624">6</xref></sup> However, when it ends a clause,<sup><xref rid="fn625">7</xref></sup> then it is ultimately accented. The latter is contrary to the laws of Hebrew grammar,<sup><xref rid="fn626">8</xref></sup> but we find it to be so.</p>
<p>2. AND THE PEOPLE CRIED UNTO MOSES. In a conciliatory manner.<sup><xref rid="fn627">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE FIRE ABATED. <italic>Va-tishka</italic> (abated) means extinguished. The word is not used again in Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn628">10</xref></sup> with this meaning.</p>
<p>3. TABERAH. I will explain this term later.<sup><xref rid="fn629">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND THE MIXED MULTITUDE. Who were gathered unto the children of Israel but were not of Israelite stock. The <italic>asafsuf</italic> (the mixed multitude) refers to the <italic>erev rav</italic> (the mixed multitude).<sup><xref rid="fn630">12</xref></sup> The word is constructed by doubling two root letters.<sup><xref rid="fn631">13</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>secharchar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn632">14</xref></sup> (fluttereth) (Ps. 38:11) and <italic>chamarmaru</italic><sup><xref rid="fn633">15</xref></sup> (burn) (Lam. 1:20).</p>
<p>AND&#x2026;WEPT. After they lusted.</p>
<p>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x2026;ON THEIR PART. With them.<sup><xref rid="fn634">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. THE FISH. The word <italic>dagah</italic> (fish) is a general term.<sup><xref rid="fn635">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR NOUGHT. Cheaply, as if we got it for nothing.</p>
<p>THE CUCUMBERS. An <italic>alef</italic> has been substituted for a <italic>heh</italic> in the word <italic>kishu&#x2019;im</italic> (cucumbers), for <italic>kishu&#x2019;im</italic> is related to the word <italic>mikshah</italic> (cucumber) (Is. 1:8).<sup><xref rid="fn636">18</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>telu&#x2019;im</italic> (suspense) in <italic>And My people are in suspense about returning to Me</italic> (Hos. 11:7).<sup><xref rid="fn637">19</xref></sup> There are many such instances.</p>
<p>MELONS. We can ascertain the meaning of <italic>avatichim</italic> (melons) from Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn638">20</xref></sup> It has no cognate in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn639">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE LEEKS. The word <italic>chatzir</italic> (leeks) refers to vegetables,<sup><xref rid="fn640">22</xref></sup> which are the grass of the field.<sup><xref rid="fn641">23</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Who maketh the mountains to spring with grass</italic> (chatzir) (Ps. 147:8). <italic>Chatzir</italic> is thus an all-inclusive noun.<sup><xref rid="fn642">24</xref></sup> However, the Aramaic translation<sup><xref rid="fn643">25</xref></sup> says that it refers to a specific kind.<sup><xref rid="fn644">26</xref></sup> It too is correct.</p>
<p>AND THE ONIONS, AND THE GARLIC. The meaning <italic>be-tzalim</italic> (onions) and <italic>shumim</italic> (garlic) is known.<sup><xref rid="fn645">27</xref></sup> They have similar names in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn646">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. BUT NOW OUR SOUL IS DRIED AWAY. The reference is to the lusting soul, which is implanted in the liver.<sup><xref rid="fn647">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL. We lack everything.</p>
<p>TO LOOK TO. For the manna came down from heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn648">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. NOW THE MANNA. Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn649">31</xref></sup> describes the stupidity of those who lusted, for the manna was like coriander seed, which is easy to pick, and it was easy to see, for it was white. Furthermore, they could eat it as it was. They could also grind it in mills and make cakes out of it. They could also beat it in mortars and cook it in pots. It had an especially good taste, for it tasted like [food] with the finest oil. Additionally, it came down after the dew had washed the place [upon which it fell]. It thus descended upon a clean place.</p>
<p>LIKE CORIANDER SEED. <italic>Zera</italic> (seed) is in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn650">32</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>neta</italic> (plant of)<sup><xref rid="fn651">33</xref></sup> in <italic>the plant of His delight</italic> (Is. 5:7).</p>
<p>CORIANDER. Some identify this with <italic>kusbarta</italic>. Others say that it refers to mustard. They connect <italic>gad</italic> (coriander) with the word <italic>gidin</italic> (sinews).<sup><xref rid="fn652">34</xref></sup> However, I do not know its meaning.</p>
<p>8. THE PEOPLE WENT ABOUT. The word <italic>shatu</italic> (went about) is related to the word <italic>shut</italic><sup><xref rid="fn653">35</xref></sup> (going to and fro) in <italic>From going to and fro</italic> (mi-shut) <italic>in the earth</italic> (Job 1:7). This shows that the individual pieces of manna did not fall in one place<sup><xref rid="fn654">36</xref></sup> but were spread and scattered.</p>
<p>IN MILLS. Operated by hand. The word <italic>rechayim</italic> (mills) does not come in the singular,<sup><xref rid="fn655">37</xref></sup> for a mill consists of two parts.<sup><xref rid="fn656">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN MORTARS. A vessel made out of wood or stone. It is called a <italic>medocha</italic> (mortars)<sup><xref rid="fn657">39</xref></sup> because they pound in it.<sup><xref rid="fn658">40</xref></sup> It was also possible to make cakes from what they pounded.<sup><xref rid="fn659">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND MADE CAKES. Compare, <italic>and make cakes</italic> (Gen. 18:6).<sup><xref rid="fn660">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>A CAKE. Some say that the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>leshad</italic> (cake) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn661">43</xref></sup> It is similar to the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>shalanan</italic> (at ease)<sup><xref rid="fn662">44</xref></sup> in <italic>at ease and quiet</italic> (Job 21:23). The word <italic>ha-shamen</italic> (with oil) should have been ultimately accented<sup><xref rid="fn663">45</xref></sup> because<sup><xref rid="fn664">46</xref></sup> the word <italic>shamen</italic> (oil) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn665">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, I believe that the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>leshad</italic> is a root letter. The word <italic>leshad</italic> is similar to the word <italic>leshadi</italic> (my sap) in <italic>My sap was turned</italic> (Ps. 32:4). <italic>My</italic> (leshadi) <italic>sap</italic> stands in contrast to <italic>the droughts</italic> (charvone) in <italic>the droughts of summer</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.)<italic>. Leshad</italic> refers to the finest part of the oil that floats on top of all oil. In this case, the word <italic>ha-shamen</italic> is penultimately vocalized in accordance with the meaning of the word.<sup><xref rid="fn666">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. WEEPING, FAMILY BY FAMILY. The families gathered together to cry, as they do when they mourn for the dead.</p>
<p>EVERY MAN AT THE DOOR OF HIS TENT. In public.</p>
<p>AND MOSES WAS DISPLEASED. The word <italic>ra</italic> (displeased) is a perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn667">49</xref></sup> On the other hand, the word <italic>hayah</italic> (was) might be missing in our text.<sup><xref rid="fn668">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. WHEREFORE HAST THOU DEALT ILL WITH THY SERVANT. Scripture describes an impetuous action.<sup><xref rid="fn669">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WHEREFORE HAVE I NOT FOUND FAVOUR IN THY SIGHT. When I said, <italic>send, I pray Thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send</italic> (Ex. 4:13).<sup><xref rid="fn670">52</xref></sup> The word <italic>matzati</italic><sup><xref rid="fn671">53</xref></sup> (found) is missing an <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn672">54</xref></sup> There are many such instances. There is nothing to wonder about when king <italic>Yehu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn673">55</xref></sup> is missing.</p>
<p>12. HAVE I CONCEIVED. Am I their mother?</p>
<p>HAVE I BROUGHT THEM FORTH. Or am I their father? <italic>Yelidtihu</italic> (brought them forth) is like the word <italic>yalad</italic> (begot) in <italic>and Shelah begot Eber</italic> (Gen. 10:24).<sup><xref rid="fn674">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>CARRY THEM. Until they come to the land.<sup><xref rid="fn675">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. WHENCE.<sup><xref rid="fn676">58</xref></sup> When the word <italic>ayin</italic> has a <italic>mem</italic> prefixed to it,<sup><xref rid="fn677">59</xref></sup> it means from which place. When <italic>ayin</italic> appears without a <italic>mem</italic> prefixed to it, it means no.<sup><xref rid="fn678">60</xref></sup> We also find the following clause, <italic>Behold, ye are nothing</italic> (me-ayin) (Is. 41:24).<sup><xref rid="fn679">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. BECAUSE IT IS TOO HEAVY FOR ME. The word <italic>kaved</italic> (heavy) is a verb in the perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn680">62</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>zaken</italic> (was old) in <italic>And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old</italic> (Gen. 27:1).<sup><xref rid="fn681">63</xref></sup> On the other hand, the word <italic>hu</italic> (it) might be missing from our text.<sup><xref rid="fn682">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>[15.] THOU. The word <italic>at</italic> (Thou) is used for both males and females.<sup><xref rid="fn683">65</xref></sup> It is like <italic>lakh</italic> (to you), <italic>bakh</italic> (in you), <italic>immakh</italic> (with you), and <italic>ittakh</italic> (with you).<sup><xref rid="fn684">66</xref></sup> However, <italic>attah</italic> (you) is only used for males.</p>
<p>KILL ME. <italic>Horgeni</italic> (kill me) means put me to death. Do this to me because of Your righteousness and my request. This is the meaning of <italic>if I have found favour in Thy sight</italic>.</p>
<p>AND LET ME NOT LOOK. Anymore upon the evil circumstances in which I find myself. There is no need for any scribal emendation.<sup><xref rid="fn685">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. GATHER UNTO ME. The word <italic>esfah</italic> (gather) is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn686">68</xref></sup> It is possible that this is so because of the guttural.<sup><xref rid="fn687">69</xref></sup> <italic>Erkhah</italic> (set in order) in <italic>Set thy words in order before me, stand forth</italic> ((Job 33:5) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn688">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND OFFICERS. For there are elders who are advanced in age but are unfit to be officers. There are also officers who are not elders.<sup><xref rid="fn689">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND I WILL COME DOWN. God&#x2019;s glory descended in fire in the midst of the cloud.<sup><xref rid="fn690">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SPEAK WITH THEE THERE. When you hear the voice they will also hear.</p>
<p>AND I WILL TAKE OF THE SPIRIT. The meaning of <italic>ve-atzalti</italic> (and I will take of the spirit) is, I will take from that which you possess.<sup><xref rid="fn691">73</xref></sup> Note that spirit<sup><xref rid="fn692">74</xref></sup> means wisdom. If some of the wisdom of Reuben is given to Simeon, Reuben&#x2019;s wisdom is not diminished. It remains as is.<sup><xref rid="fn693">75</xref></sup> Let the light of a candle serve as an example.<sup><xref rid="fn694">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. SANCTIFY YOURSELVES.<sup><xref rid="fn695">77</xref></sup> Words from the root of <italic>kodesh</italic> (to sanctify) are found in the positive and the negative.<sup><xref rid="fn696">78</xref></sup> <italic>Ha-yikdash</italic> (Haggai 2:12), which means <italic>shall it be unclean</italic>, is similar.</p>
<p>19. NOR TWO DAYS. Twice as much.<sup><xref rid="fn697">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>NOR FIVE DAYS. Corresponding to the fingers of the hand of those who eat.</p>
<p>NEITHER TEN DAYS. Twice the amount, corresponding to the fingers of the two hands of those who eat.<sup><xref rid="fn698">80</xref></sup> <italic>Nor twenty days</italic> has a similar meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn699">81</xref></sup> This may be compared to the saying: Let him eat with the fingers of his hands and with the toes of his feet.<sup><xref rid="fn700">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. BUT A WHOLE MONTH. I have already explained the meaning of the word <italic>chodesh yamim</italic> (a whole month).<sup><xref rid="fn701">83</xref></sup> The phrase <italic>chodesh yamim</italic> alludes to the time that it takes for the moon&#x2019;s light to return to its original amount.<sup><xref rid="fn702">84</xref></sup> <italic>Shenatayim yamim</italic> (two full years) (Gen. 41:1) is similar to <italic>chodesh yamim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn703">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AT YOUR NOSTRILS.]<sup><xref rid="fn704">86</xref></sup> The sense of smell is located in the nose. The sense of smell will depart from your nostrils, and will not be found there.<sup><xref rid="fn705">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND IT BE LOATHSOME. The word <italic>le-zara</italic> is spelled with an <italic>alef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn706">88</xref></sup> in place of the <italic>heh</italic>. Compare, <italic>mara</italic> in <italic>call me Mara</italic><sup><xref rid="fn707">89</xref></sup> (Ruth 1:20), for the letters <italic>alef, heh, vav, yod</italic> interchange.</p>
<p>The word <italic>zara</italic> (loathsome) refers to something which is strange<sup><xref rid="fn708">90</xref></sup> and abhorrent to the nature of a person who is not used to it.</p>
<p>21. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN ON FOOT. There is no need to mention the lesser ones.<sup><xref rid="fn709">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many interpret this section in various ways.<sup><xref rid="fn710">92</xref></sup> Some say that Moses paraphrased what the children of Israel would say to him. When they would ask, what sort of meat,<sup><xref rid="fn711">93</xref></sup> Moses would answer them, you have no need to ask,<sup><xref rid="fn712">94</xref></sup> for <italic>is the Lord&#x2019;s hand waxed short</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn713">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>I do not know why we must suffer in this manner.<sup><xref rid="fn714">96</xref></sup> The text must be interpreted according to its plain meaning. Moses did not know that God would create a sign or a miracle.<sup><xref rid="fn715">97</xref></sup> He thought, as I will explain, that he would do so only to justify his prophet.<sup><xref rid="fn716">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. WILL THEY SUFFICE THEM. <italic>U-matza la-hem</italic> (will they suffice them) is to be interpreted as in the Aramaic translation.<sup><xref rid="fn717">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>How precious is the interpretation of our ancients to the effect that the word <italic>yishachet</italic> (be slain) applies to cattle, and <italic>ya&#x2019;asef</italic> (be gathered) refers to fish.<sup><xref rid="fn718">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>23 WHETHER MY WORD SHALL COME TO PASS, The word <italic>ha-yikrekha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn719">101</xref></sup> (shall come to pass) is similar to <italic>va-yiker mikrehah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn720">102</xref></sup> (and her hap was) (Ruth 2:3).</p>
<p>24. AND MOSES WENT OUT. From the tent of meeting.</p>
<p>25. AND TOOK OF THE SPIRIT. In my opinion, the word <italic>va-yatzel</italic> (and took of the spirit) is a <italic>hifil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn721">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND THEY PROPHESIED.] The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>va-yitnabbe&#x2019;u</italic> (and they prophesied) is like an unaspirated <italic>fa</italic> in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn722">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT THY DID SO NO MORE.<sup><xref rid="fn723">105</xref></sup> A second time.<sup><xref rid="fn724">106</xref></sup> The same applies to the phrase <italic>ve-lo yasaf</italic> (and it went on no more) in <italic>with a great voice, and it went on no more</italic><sup><xref rid="fn725">107</xref></sup> (Deut. 5:19) and <italic>ve-lo yasaf</italic> (now more) in <italic>and he knew her again no more</italic><sup><xref rid="fn726">108</xref></sup> (Gen. 38:26).</p>
<p>According to the rules of Hebrew grammar, the word <italic>yasaf</italic> is not related to the word <italic>tissafu</italic> (swept away)<sup><xref rid="fn727">109</xref></sup> in <italic>lest ye be swept away in all their sins</italic> (Num. 16:26).<sup><xref rid="fn728">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our sages of blessed memory say that Moses took six men from each tribe. Their number thus came to seventy-two. However, Moses dropped the two<sup><xref rid="fn729">111</xref></sup> because God told him to gather seventy men.<sup><xref rid="fn730">112</xref></sup> This is correct.</p>
<p>26. AND THEY WERE OF THEM THAT WERE RECORDED. At first.<sup><xref rid="fn731">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT HAD NOT GONE OUT. From the camp of Israel to the tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn732">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND THERE RAN A YOUNG MAN. The word <italic>na&#x2019;ar</italic> (young man) has the definite article prefixed to it because it refers to the young man<sup><xref rid="fn733">115</xref></sup> who, aside from Joshua, was known to serve Moses. For Joshua&#x2019;s service was not the usual service rendered by young men.<sup><xref rid="fn734">116</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. FROM HIS YOUTH UP. Some say that the meaning of <italic>mi-bechurav</italic> (from his youth up) is, from his youth. It means that he did not speak as an elder speaks.<sup><xref rid="fn735">117</xref></sup> Others connect <italic>mi-bechurav</italic> (from his youth up) to <italic>mesharet mosheh</italic> (the minister of Moses);<sup><xref rid="fn736">118</xref></sup> this means the one who served Moses from the time of his youth.<sup><xref rid="fn737">119</xref></sup> However, this is incorrect, for this event occurred in the second year.<sup><xref rid="fn738">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>In my opinion, the word <italic>mi-bechurav</italic> means from the chosen. It means that he was one of those chosen to serve Moses, for there were others with him.<sup><xref rid="fn739">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that the word <italic>bachur</italic> (youth, or chosen) sometimes changes in the plural and sometimes does not.<sup><xref rid="fn740">122</xref></sup> The same applies to the word <italic>saris</italic> (officer).<sup><xref rid="fn741">123</xref></sup> It is also possible that they belong to two different paradigms.<sup><xref rid="fn742">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHUT THEM IN. The <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>kela&#x2019;em</italic> (shut them in) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn743">125</xref></sup> because a guttural<sup><xref rid="fn744">126</xref></sup> follows it.<sup><xref rid="fn745">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>[29. ART THOU JEALOUS.] The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>ha-mekanne</italic> (art thou jealous) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>. However, it should have been vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic> and <italic>a pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn746">128</xref></sup> It was so vocalized because the <italic>mem</italic> has a <italic>sheva na</italic><sup><xref rid="fn747">129</xref></sup> beneath it and two <italic>sheva nas</italic><sup><xref rid="fn748">130</xref></sup> are never joined together.</p>
<p>[WOULD THAT.] <italic>Mi yitten</italic><sup><xref rid="fn749">131</xref></sup> (would that) is an expression of desire here. It is like saying, who will grant me this request and desire?</p>
<p>30. AND MOSES WITHDREW. Moses accompanied the elders in order to honor them.</p>
<p>31. AND THERE WENT FORTH A WIND. On the second day.<sup><xref rid="fn750">132</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BROUGHT ACROSS. The word <italic>va-gaz</italic> (brought across) means cut. It is similar to the word <italic>gazi</italic> (cut) in <italic>Cut off thy hair</italic> (Jer. 7:29). The word <italic>gez</italic> (cutting) in <italic>and the first of the cutting of thy sheep</italic> (Deut. 18:4)<sup><xref rid="fn751">133</xref></sup> is related to it.</p>
<p>Scripture reads, <italic>and cut</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn752">134</xref></sup> because the quail on the shore of the sea<sup><xref rid="fn753">135</xref></sup> were as numerous as the [grains of] sand. Thus God cut off some of the quail from them.<sup><xref rid="fn754">136</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn655"><sup>37</sup> The word <italic>rechayim</italic> is in the plural. However, it also refers to the singular, that is, to a mill as in our verse, for <italic>rechayim</italic> (mills) is parallel to <italic>medochah</italic> (mortar), which is singular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn656"><sup>38</sup> An upper and a lower stone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn657"><sup>39</sup> Literally, a mortar. See previous note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn658"><sup>40</sup> The word <italic>medocha</italic> comes from the root <italic>dalet, caf, heh</italic>, which means to crush.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn660"><sup>42</sup> We thus see that the word make can mean bake.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn661"><sup>43</sup> The basic word is <italic>shad</italic> (breast). According to this interpretation, <italic>leshad ha-shamen</italic> means breast of the oil.

<ftnote id="fn666"><sup>48</sup> For the word is a noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn667"><sup>49</sup> And also a present form. Here it is a past.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn668"><sup>50</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>u-ve&#x2019;ene moshe ra</italic>. The latter literally means: and in the eyes of Moses displeased. I.E. suggests that our verse be interpreted as if it read, <italic>u-ve&#x2019;ene moshe hayah ra</italic> (and it was displeasing in the eyes of Moses). In this case, our verse is a continuous present.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn669"><sup>51</sup> Moses spoke impulsively, as one is wont to do under pressure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn670"><sup>52</sup> You chose me then. Why, then, do I not find favor in your eyes now?</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn673"><sup>55</sup> That is, when either a <italic>yod, heh, vav</italic>, or <italic>alef</italic> is dropped. These letters spell the name Yehu, who was a king of Judah. I.E. employs the king&#x2019;s name as a mnemonic device.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn676"><sup>58</sup> Hebrew, <italic>me-ayin</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn679"><sup>61</sup> In this case, <italic>me-ayin</italic> has the meaning of nothing even though it has a <italic>mem</italic> prefixed to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn680"><sup>62</sup> And also a present. In our case, it is a past.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn681"><sup>63</sup> The word <italic>zaken</italic> can be a perfect or a present form. In Gen. 27:1, it is a perfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn682"><sup>64</sup> In other words, our text should be read as if written <italic>ki khaved hu mi-menni</italic>. In this case, <italic>khaved</italic> is a present.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn683"><sup>65</sup> The word <italic>at</italic> (thou) is usually used when addressing a female. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn684"><sup>66</sup> These words are used for both masculine and feminine in the middle (at an <italic>etnachta</italic>) and end of a Biblical verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn685"><sup>67</sup> See Rashi: &#x201C;It ought to have written and let me not see their evil, only that Scripture modified the expression [i.e., it used a euphemistic expression referring the evil to himself instead of to the whole people]. This is one of the variations occurring in the Torah such as writers make for the purpose of modifying and improving the phrase&#x201D; (Rosenbaum and Silbermann translation). See Vol. 1, p. 18, and p. 195, note 33.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn686"><sup>68</sup> The <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>esfah</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic>. However, it should have been vocalized with a short <italic>kamatz</italic>. Compare, <italic>zokhrah</italic> (Neh. 5:19).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn687"><sup>69</sup> The <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>esfah</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn689"><sup>71</sup> According to I.E. the meaning of <italic>the elders of the people and the officers</italic> is the elders of the people who also serve as officers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn690"><sup>72</sup> In other words, it was God&#x2019;s glory that descended, not God himself.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn696"><sup>78</sup> According to I.E. the word <italic>hitkaddeshu</italic> (sanctify yourself) in our verse has a negative connotation. See Rashi, who explains the word to mean &#x201C;prepare yourselves to receive punishment&#x201D; (Rosenbaum and Silbermann translation).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn697"><sup>79</sup> Scripture speaks of one day, two days, five days, ten days, and twenty days. I.E. now goes on to explain the reason for these numbers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn698"><sup>80</sup> Of those who demanded meat to eat.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn703"><sup>85</sup> It means two complete years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn704"><sup>86</sup> <italic>Me-appekhem</italic> (at your nostrils) literally means from your nostrils. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn710"><sup>92</sup> The commentaries were bothered by Moses apparently doubting the ability of God to provide meat for all of the Israelites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn711"><sup>93</sup> In other words, verses 21 and 22 are Moses&#x2019; paraphrase of what the people would tell him when he told them that God would provide meat for them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn712"><sup>94</sup> See verse 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn713"><sup>95</sup> In some of the printed editions as well as in the Vatican manuscript, <italic>is the Lord&#x2019;s hand waxed short</italic> has been detached from the verse and opens a new comment on verse 23. However, this is an error. See Meijler.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn718"><sup>100</sup> Scripture speaks of slaughtering sheep and gathering fish. According to the rabbis this verse teaches us that cattle require ritual slaughter (<italic>shechitah</italic>) but fish do not. See <italic>Hullin</italic> 27b.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn723"><sup>105</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ve-lo yasaf</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn724"><sup>106</sup> The literal meaning of <italic>lo yasefu</italic> is, they did not add. Hence I.E. points out that this term is an idiom meaning they did not repeat it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn725"><sup>107</sup> It did not repeat itself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn726"><sup>108</sup> Its meaning is, he knew her not a second time.</ftnote>

<p>1. AND MIRIAM&#x2026;SPOKE. Miriam spoke. Aaron agreed or was silent.<sup><xref rid="fn767">1</xref></sup> Hence he was also punished.</p>
<p><italic>Va-tedabber</italic> (spoke) is followed by a <italic>bet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn768">2</xref></sup> and has a negative connotation. It is similar to <italic>va-yedabber ha-am be-Elohim</italic> (And the people spoke against God) (Num. 21:5). The verb <italic>dabber</italic> (spoke) followed by a <italic>bet</italic> is also found with a positive connotation.<sup><xref rid="fn769">3</xref></sup> It also appears in prophetic statements.<sup><xref rid="fn770">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that Moses was king of Cush<sup><xref rid="fn771">5</xref></sup> and took a Cushite woman.<sup><xref rid="fn772">6</xref></sup> Onkelos renders Cushite, beautiful.<sup><xref rid="fn773">7</xref></sup> According to Onkelos, Cushite is an honorific term. The Arabs similarly call pitch white. We too refer to a blind person by the term <italic>sege nahor</italic> (rich of light).<sup><xref rid="fn774">8</xref></sup> But it is illogical<sup><xref rid="fn775">9</xref></sup> to turn a positive name into a negative one.<sup><xref rid="fn776">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that <italic>Cush the Benjaminite</italic> (Ps. 7:1) refers to Saul.<sup><xref rid="fn777">11</xref></sup> They say the same with regard to <italic>Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians</italic> (Khushiyyim) <italic>unto Me</italic> (Amos 9:7).<sup><xref rid="fn778">12</xref></sup> I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn779">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that the Cushite woman is to be identified with Zipporah, for Zipporah was a Midianite.<sup><xref rid="fn780">14</xref></sup> The Midianites are Ishmaelites<sup><xref rid="fn781">15</xref></sup> and they live in tents.<sup><xref rid="fn782">16</xref></sup> Scripture similarly writes: <italic>The curtains</italic><sup><xref rid="fn783">17</xref></sup> <italic>of the land of Midian do tremble</italic> (Hab. 3:7). Because of the sun<sup><xref rid="fn784">18</xref></sup> they do not have any whiteness at all. Zipporah was black and was like a Cushite.</p>
<p>[FOR HE HAD MARRIED A CUSHITE WOMAN.] These are the words that Miriam spoke. How precious are the words of the ancients who said with regard to the elders, &#x201C;Happy are they, but woe to their wives.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn785">19</xref></sup> They suspected that Moses refrained from sleeping with Zipporah only because she was not beautiful.<sup><xref rid="fn786">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND THEY SAID: HATH THE LORD INDEED SPOKEN ONLY WITH MOSES? Miriam offered proof that Moses did not act in this manner because of the sanctity of God, for they too were prophets and they were not prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>ONLY WITH. Scripture reads, <italic>ha-rak akh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn787">21</xref></sup> One term<sup><xref rid="fn788">22</xref></sup> would have sufficed. However, Scripture is employing elegant language.<sup><xref rid="fn789">23</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ha-mi-mi-beli en kevarim</italic> (because there were no graves) (Ex. 14:11).<sup><xref rid="fn790">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE LORD HEARD IT. Even though they spoke in secret.<sup><xref rid="fn791">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. WAS VERY MEEK. The word <italic>anav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn792">26</xref></sup> (meek) is similar to the word <italic>shalev</italic><sup><xref rid="fn793">27</xref></sup> (at peace) (Job 16:12).<sup><xref rid="fn794">28</xref></sup> Its meaning is that Moses did not seek honor over his brother.<sup><xref rid="fn795">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. SUDDENLY. The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>pitom</italic> (suddenly) is superfluous. It is like the mem of <italic>shilshom</italic> (three days ago).<sup><xref rid="fn796">30</xref></sup> <italic>Pitom</italic> is related to <italic>peti</italic> (a thoughtless one) (Prov. 9:4). It refers to something that one did not think of.<sup><xref rid="fn797">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>COME OUT YE THREE UNTO THE TENT OF MEETING. Each one from his tent. Scripture first speaks generally.<sup><xref rid="fn798">32</xref></sup> It then goes into detail, namely, <italic>And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud&#x2026;and called Aaron and Miriam</italic> (v. 5), and Moses heard.<sup><xref rid="fn799">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. HEAR NOW MY WORDS. The word <italic>na</italic> means now.<sup><xref rid="fn800">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>A PROPHET AMONG YOU. If there be a prophet of God among you.<sup><xref rid="fn801">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN A VISION The meaning of <italic>im yiheyeh nevi&#x2019;akhem Adonai</italic><sup><xref rid="fn802">36</xref></sup> (if there be a prophet among you, I the Lord) is, if there be a prophet, one who is a prophet of God among you.<sup><xref rid="fn803">37</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ve-hanevu&#x2019;ah oded ha-navi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn804">38</xref></sup> (even the prophecy of Oded the prophet (II Chron. 15:8); and <italic>ha-ohelah sarah immo</italic> (his mother Sarah&#x2019;s tent) (Gen. 24:67);<sup><xref rid="fn805">39</xref></sup> and <italic>kisakha Elohim olam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn806">40</xref></sup> (Thy throne given of God is for ever) (Ps. 45:7).</p>
<p>IN A VISION. In the visions of the night.</p>
<p>I DO SPEAK WITH HIM IN A DREAM. Scripture repeats itself as is its style in prophecies.<sup><xref rid="fn807">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. HE IS TRUSTED IN ALL MY HOUSE. It means that Moses is, at it were, a member of My house. He enters without permission. If necessary he states his needs. However, in your case when I make myself known to you in a dream, then you are informed. If not, then you have no permission to ask.</p>
<p>8. WITH HIM DO I SPEAK MOUTH TO MOUTH. The meaning is, I speak to him without an intermediary.<sup><xref rid="fn808">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVEN MANIFESTLY, AND NOT IN DARK SPEECHES. This means I illustrate my word to him as I did when I commanded the erection of the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn809">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND NOT IN DARK SPEECHES. Compare, <italic>A great eagle</italic> (<italic>&#x2026;Came unto Lebanon, And took the top of the cedar</italic>) (Ezek. 17:3).</p>
<p>AND THE SIMILITUDE OF THE LORD DOTH HE BEHOLD. As in the case of <italic>Show me, I pray Thee, Thy glory</italic> (Ex. 33:18).<sup><xref rid="fn810">44</xref></sup> Or its meaning is<sup><xref rid="fn811">45</xref></sup> that God communicates with Moses when Moses is awake.</p>
<p>9. AND HE DEPARTED. The reference is to God&#x2019;s glory. <italic>And when the cloud was removed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn812">46</xref></sup> (v. 10) proves this.</p>
<p>10. FROM OVER THE TENT. From over the opening of the tent.<sup><xref rid="fn813">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND&#x2026;BEHOLD, MIRIAM WAS LEPROUS. <italic>Ve-hinneh metzora&#x2019;at</italic><sup><xref rid="fn814">48</xref></sup> is to be rendered, and behold, &#x201C;she&#x201D; [Miriam] was leprous.<sup><xref rid="fn815">49</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ka&#x2019;asher ka&#x2019;ah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn816">50</xref></sup> (as it vomited out) (Lev. 18:28).</p>
<p>11. OH MY LORD. I have already explained the meaning of <italic>bi adoni</italic> (Oh my lord).<sup><xref rid="fn817">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>LAY NOT, I PRAY THEE. The meaning of <italic>al na</italic><sup><xref rid="fn818">52</xref></sup> (&#x2026;not, I pray thee) is, now, do not.<sup><xref rid="fn819">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>WE HAVE DONE FOOLISHLY. The word <italic>no&#x2019;alnu</italic> (we have done foolishly) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. It has no cognate<sup><xref rid="fn820">54</xref></sup> except for the word <italic>no&#x2019;alu</italic> (are become fools)<sup><xref rid="fn821">55</xref></sup> in <italic>The princes of Zoan are become fools</italic> (Is. 19:13).</p>
<p>Some say that the root of <italic>no&#x2019;alnu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn822">56</xref></sup> was formed by inverting the root <italic>ivvelet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn823">57</xref></sup> (foolishness). Compare, <italic>Foolishness is bound up</italic> (Prov. 22:15) (in the heart of a child). The meaning of <italic>no&#x2019;alnu</italic> is known.<sup><xref rid="fn824">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. LET HER NOT, I PRAY, BE AS ONE DEAD. Let our sister not now be as a stillborn child, half of whose flesh is consumed when it comes out of its mother&#x2019;s womb. The same is true of the flesh of a leper.<sup><xref rid="fn825">59</xref></sup> There is no need for a scribal emendation.<sup><xref rid="fn826">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND MOSES CRIED. This shows that Moses was pained because of what happened to his sister.</p>
<p>O GOD. You who hold the power in Your hands,<sup><xref rid="fn827">61</xref></sup> heal her now. God therefore answered him as follows: If her father was angry at her and spat in her face, would she not hide in shame from seeing his face for seven days?</p>
<p>14. SHUT UP. As lepers are, so that they do not harm others.<sup><xref rid="fn828">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND AFTER THAT SHE SHALL BE BROUGHT IN AGAIN. <italic>Ve-acher te&#x2019;asef</italic> (and after that she shall be brought in again) means she shall once again be considered as a member of the community. <italic>Va-asafto</italic> (and you shall bring him in) in <italic>and you shall bring him in from his leprosy</italic> (II Kings 5:3) is similar. After Miriam returned to the camp, the people journeyed from Hazeroth.</p>
<p>16. AND PITCHED IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN. Many believe that the cloud was there.<sup><xref rid="fn829">63</xref></sup> They interpret thus because they found Scripture stating <italic>and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran</italic> (Num. 10:12).<sup><xref rid="fn830">64</xref></sup> They interpret <italic>And when the cloud was removed from over the Tent</italic> (v. 10) literally.<sup><xref rid="fn831">65</xref></sup> However, I believe that this is not the correct meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn832">66</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn767"><sup>1</sup> In other words, <italic>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses</italic> is to be interpreted: And Miriam spoke against Moses, and Aaron remained silent (or agreed). I.E. interprets thus because our verse reads, <italic>va-tedabber miriam ve-aharon</italic>. Now <italic>va-tedabber</italic> is in the feminine. Thus our verse is to be rendered, And Miriam spoke, and Aaron. If both spoke, then our text should have read, <italic>va-yedabberu miriam ve-aharon</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn768"><sup>2</sup> As it is in our verse, which reads, <italic>va-tedabber miriam ve-aharon be-mosheh</italic> (And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn769"><sup>3</sup> Compare, <italic>I will now say</italic> (adabberah): <italic>Peace be within thee</italic> (bakh) (Ps. 122:8).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn770"><sup>4</sup> Compare, <italic>The spirit of the Lord spoke by me</italic> (II Sam. 23:2).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn771"><sup>5</sup> Ethiopia.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn772"><sup>6</sup> See <italic>Yalkut Shimoni</italic> on <italic>Shemot</italic> 168; 247.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn773"><sup>7</sup> Onkelos renders <italic>ha-ishah ha-cushit</italic> (the Cushite woman) as the beautiful women (<italic>ittetah shappirtah</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn774"><sup>8</sup> See <italic>Berachot</italic> 58a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn775"><sup>9</sup> However, see Rashi, who explains Zipporah &#x201C;was called a Cushite because of her beauty. This is similar to the case of a man who calls his beautiful son Cushi so that the evil eye will not harm him.&#x201D; I.E. apparently did not believe in the evil eye. Hence he did not accept Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn776"><sup>10</sup> When something has a negative connotation we employ a euphemism. However, we do not refer to something positive by a negative term. Hence there is no reason to refer to a beautiful woman as a Cushite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn777"><sup>11</sup> They believe that Saul was very handsome and hence was called <italic>cush</italic>. See Rashi and I.E. on Ps. 7:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn778"><sup>12</sup> They say that its meaning is: Are ye not as beautiful children unto me.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn779"><sup>13</sup> See I.E. on Amos 9:7, where he explains this verse to mean: You are acting like Cushites in that you do not serve me.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn780"><sup>14</sup> See Ex. 2:15-21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn781"><sup>15</sup> See Jud. 8:24. Also see I.E. on Gen. 37:28 (Vol. 1, p. 351).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn782"><sup>16</sup> Which are pitched in the wilderness under the hot sun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn783"><sup>17</sup> The reference is to the curtains of the tents. We thus see that the Midianites live in tents.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn784"><sup>18</sup> They are very sunburned. See Cant. 1:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn785"><sup>19</sup> According to the rabbis, Zipporah complained that Moses ceased having sexual relations with her ever since he was chosen to receive Divine revelation. The rabbis say that Miriam spoke on behalf of Zipporah and argued that she too was a prophetess and yet did not abstain from relations with her husband. See <italic>Mo&#x2019;ed Katan</italic> 17b; <italic>Sifre, Devarim</italic> 99; and <italic>Yalkut Shimoni, Devarim</italic> 738.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn786"><sup>20</sup> And not because he was a prophet. According to I.E., <italic>because of the Cushite woman whom he had married</italic> is to be understood as: because he refrained from sleeping with her because she was a Cushite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn787"><sup>21</sup> <italic>Rak</italic> means only; so does <italic>akh</italic>. Thus our clause, which reads <italic>ha-rak akh be-mosheh dibber Adonai</italic>, literally reads: Hath the Lord spoken only only with Moses. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn788"><sup>22</sup> <italic>Rak</italic> or <italic>akh</italic>. Our text should have read, <italic>ha-rak be-mosheh</italic>, or <italic>ha-akh be-mosheh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn789"><sup>23</sup> It is considered poetic to repeat certain words in certain contexts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn790"><sup>24</sup> <italic>Beli</italic> and <italic>en</italic> mean the same thing. See I.E. on Ex. 14:11 (Vol. 2, p. 277).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn799"><sup>33</sup> What God told Aaron and Miriam.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn800"><sup>34</sup> See I.E. on Num. 10:31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn801"><sup>35</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>nevi&#x2019;akhem</italic>, which literally means your prophet. In this case, our verse reads, if your prophet will be.

<p>1. SEND THOU MEN. Scripture records that God told Israel: <italic>go up, take possession</italic> (Deut. 1:21)<sup><xref rid="fn833">1</xref></sup> and Israel answered: <italic>Let us send men before us</italic> (Deut. 1:22).<sup><xref rid="fn834">2</xref></sup> God then said, <italic>Send thou men</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn835">3</xref></sup></p>

[THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE MEN.] The reason that Scripture states, <italic>these are the names of the men</italic>, after earlier stating, <italic>And these were their names</italic> (v. 4),<sup><xref rid="fn846">14</xref></sup> is to teach us that, unlike Hoshea,<sup><xref rid="fn847">15</xref></sup> their names were never changed.</p>
<p>17. GET YOU UP HERE INTO THE SOUTH. Get you up this way in the south.<sup><xref rid="fn848">16</xref></sup> It is known that Egypt is south of the land of Israel, as I have explained in the Book of Daniel.<sup><xref rid="fn849">17</xref></sup> The following is proof of this. Egypt is less than thirty degrees north of the equator.<sup><xref rid="fn850">18</xref></sup> Jerusalem is thirty-three degrees north of the equator.<sup><xref rid="fn851">19</xref></sup> The desert of Paran<sup><xref rid="fn852">20</xref></sup> is south of the land of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn853">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observe that the meaning of <italic>in the South</italic><sup><xref rid="fn854">22</xref></sup> is not south of the camp<sup><xref rid="fn855">23</xref></sup> but in the south of the land of Canaan. Proof of the aforementioned is that Scripture tells us concerning Hebron, which belonged to the tribe of Judah, <italic>Judah shall abide in his border on the south</italic> (Josh. 18:5).<sup><xref rid="fn856">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND SEE THE LAND, WHAT IT IS. And the people, what is it?<sup><xref rid="fn857">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHETHER THEY ARE STRONG. In battle. Scripture then<sup><xref rid="fn858">26</xref></sup> goes on to explain, <italic>and see the land</italic>. It says, <italic>and what the land is&#x2026;whether it is good</italic>, that is, whether its air and water are good.</p>
<p>19. WHETHER IN CAMPS. Like the Kederites,<sup><xref rid="fn859">27</xref></sup> who live in tents.</p>
<p>20. WHETHER IT IS FAT. In producing wheat.</p>
<p>22. [AND CAME UNTO HEBRON.] Our sages of blessed memory said that <italic>and came</italic> refers to Caleb the son of Jephunneh,<sup><xref rid="fn860">28</xref></sup> for each one of the men went to a different part of the country.<sup><xref rid="fn861">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>ZOAN IN EGYPT. Zoan is the name of a city in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn862">30</xref></sup> <italic>Of Beth-lehem Judah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn863">31</xref></sup> (Ruth 1:1)<sup><xref rid="fn864">32</xref></sup> is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn865">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that the word <italic>tzo&#x2019;an</italic> (Zoan) is connected to the word <italic>yitzan</italic> (be removed) in <italic>A tent that shall not be removed</italic> (Is. 33:20).<sup><xref rid="fn866">34</xref></sup> However, this is farfetched. Scripture mentions Hebron in order to tell us that Hebron came into being before Zoan.</p>
<p>23. UNTO THE VALLEY OF ESHCOL. These are the words of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn867">35</xref></sup> It is possible that it is similar to <italic>and pursued as far as Dan</italic> (Gen. 14:14) in that it had another name.<sup><xref rid="fn868">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. WAS CALLED. <italic>Kara</italic> (was called) is to be rendered, someone called.<sup><xref rid="fn869">37</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>whom she bore to Levi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn870">38</xref></sup> (Num. 26:59).<sup><xref rid="fn871">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. [AT THE END.] The word <italic>mi-ketz</italic> (at the end) sometimes means at the beginning and sometimes means at the end.<sup><xref rid="fn872">40</xref></sup> <italic>Mi-ketz arba&#x2019;im yom</italic> (and the end of forty days) probably means at the start of the fortieth day.<sup><xref rid="fn873">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. AND THEY WENT. This informs us that they did not go to their tents, which were in the camp, but immediately went [to Moses, Aaron, and all the congregation].</p>
<p>AND BROUGHT BACK WORD. To Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p>27. AND THEY TOLD HIM. They told Moses, for he was the most important one.</p>
<p>30. AND CALEB STILLED THE PEOPLE. Rabbi Jonah the grammarian says that the meaning of <italic>va-yahas</italic> (and&#x2026;stilled) is: and he said be still (<italic>hasu</italic>).</p>
<p>32. AND THEY SPREAD AN EVIL REPORT OF THE LAND. <italic>Va-yotzi&#x2019;u dibbat ha-aretz</italic> (and they spread an evil report) means: and they spread a lie. This is not the meaning of <italic>va-yave yosef et dibbatam ra</italic> (and Joseph brought evil report of them) (Gen. 37:2), for <italic>va-yave</italic> (brought) is the reverse of <italic>va-yotzi</italic> (and they spread).<sup><xref rid="fn874">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVIL REPORT. The word <italic>dibbah</italic> (evil report) comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn875">43</xref></sup> It comes from the same root as the word <italic>dovev</italic> (moving gently) in <italic>Moving gently the lips of those that are asleep</italic> (Cant. 7:10). I have explained it in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn876">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>EATETH UP THE INHABITANTS THEREOF. For its air is bad.</p>
<p>MEN OF GREAT STATURE.<sup><xref rid="fn877">45</xref></sup> Every man is a man of measurements. <italic>Anshe middot</italic> means men of great measurement, men whose measurements are greater than everyone else&#x2019;s. The same applies to the phrase <italic>anshe levav</italic> (men of heart)<sup><xref rid="fn878">46</xref></sup> (Job. 34:34).<sup><xref rid="fn879">47</xref></sup> There are many other instances similar to the above.</p>
<p>33. THE NEPHILIM. I have already explained this term.<sup><xref rid="fn880">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF THE NEPHILIM. Its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn881">49</xref></sup> is that they were of the Nephilim, who <italic>were in the earth in those days, and also after that when&#x2026;came in</italic> (Gen 6:4).<sup><xref rid="fn882">50</xref></sup> I have explained it<sup><xref rid="fn883">51</xref></sup> there.<sup><xref rid="fn884">52</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn833"><sup>1</sup> Of the land of Canaan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn834"><sup>2</sup> Thus it appears that the spies were sent to Canaan in response to Israel&#x2019;s request. However, our Torah portion seems to imply that Moses sent spies to Canaan in response to God&#x2019;s command.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn835"><sup>3</sup> In other words, what is reported in our verse was in response to Israel&#x2019;s request reported in Deut. 1:21,22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn836"><sup>4</sup> Its meaning is, all of them were men known for their might.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn837"><sup>5</sup> The meaning of <italic>and show thyself a man</italic> is: and show thyself to be a man of valor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn838"><sup>6</sup> Thus <italic>and show thyself to be man</italic> cannot be taken literally.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn842"><sup>10</sup> Thus the word <italic>ehad</italic> is not missing in our text, and <italic>kol echad nasi ba-hem</italic> is not short for <italic>kol echad hu nasi ba-hem</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn843"><sup>11</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn848"><sup>16</sup> In other words, <italic>alu zeh ba-negev</italic> is to be rendered: get you up this way i n the south (of the land of Canaan). The literal meaning of <italic>alu zeh ba-negev</italic> is: get you up this into the south. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn849"><sup>17</sup> See I.E. on Dan. 11:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn850"><sup>18</sup> Hebrew, <italic>rochav</italic>, a term referring to the distance of a plane to the equator.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn851"><sup>19</sup> See above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn852"><sup>20</sup> Where Israel was encamped when Moses sent out the spies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn853"><sup>21</sup> The text reads, south of the land of Egypt. Paran was the place where Israel was when it sent out the spies. Geographically speaking, Paran is not south of Egypt. It is north of Egypt and lies between Egypt and Canaan. Hence a number of commentaries suggest emending the text to read, the wilderness of Paran is south of the land of Israel, or the wilderness of Paran is north of the land of Egypt. See Filwarg, Weiser, Krinsky, and Meijler.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn854"><sup>22</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ba-negev</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn855"><sup>23</sup> For taking a road south of the camp would lead them back into Egypt, as Paran is north of Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn856"><sup>24</sup> We thus see that the south (the Negev) is a district in the Land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn857"><sup>25</sup> In other words, the term <italic>ma hi</italic> (what is it) is carried over from <italic>ha-aretz</italic> (and the land) to <italic>ha-am</italic> (the people). Thus our text is to be read as if written, <italic>et ha-aretz mah hi vet ha-am ma hu</italic> (the land, what it is and the people what is it,) i.e., what is their nature.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn858"><sup>26</sup> In verse 19.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn862"><sup>30</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>tzo&#x2019;an mitzrayim</italic> literally, Zoan Egypt. Now a proper name does not come in the construct. Hence I.E. points out that here it does, contrary to the rule. According to I.E. <italic>tzo&#x2019;an mitzrayim</italic> is short for <italic>tzo&#x2019;an shel mitzrayim</italic>, Zoan of Egypt.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn864"><sup>32</sup> The meaning of which is Beth-lehem of Judah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn865"><sup>33</sup> Here too two common nouns are in the construct, for Beth-lehem Judah is short for Beth-lehem of Judah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn866"><sup>34</sup> These commentaries interpret <italic>tzo&#x2019;an mitzrayim</italic> as meaning the establishment of Egypt</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn867"><sup>35</sup> The valley of Eshcol was not yet so called when the spies came there. However, Moses called it by the name which the Israelites later used in referring to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn868"><sup>36</sup> Dan had two names, Dan and Layish (Jud. 18:29). However, Moses in writing the Torah used the name by which Israel referred to it. So too Nahal Eshcol had another name, and Moses used the name that the Israelites used. For other interpretations, see Filwarg and Meijler.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn869"><sup>37</sup> Our verse literally reads, called that place Nahal Eshcol. Scripture omits the subject. Hence I.E. says that &#x201C;called&#x201D; is short for &#x201C;the caller called,&#x201D; that is, someone called.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn870"><sup>38</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn871"><sup>39</sup> Here too Scripture does not identify the subject. Thus <italic>who she bore</italic> has to be rendered whom somebody bore.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn873"><sup>41</sup> According to the Torah, God decreed that Israel spend a year in the desert for each day that the spies spent in Canaan. Now Israel spent 39 years in the desert (see Rashi on 14:33). Hence I.E. assumes that the spies spent 39 days in Canaan (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn874"><sup>42</sup> For there the report was true. In other words, when <italic>dibbatam</italic> follows <italic>va- yave</italic>, it refers to the truth. When it follows <italic>va-yotzi</italic>, it refers to a lie.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 14</title>
<p>1. THEIR VOICE. <italic>Et kolam</italic> (their voice) is the object of <italic>va-tissa</italic> (lifted up) and also of <italic>va-yittenu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn885">1</xref></sup> (and cried).<sup><xref rid="fn886">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. MURMURED. <italic>Va-yillonu</italic> (murmured) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. It is an <italic>ayin vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn887">3</xref></sup> When conjugated in the <italic>nifal</italic> it looks like a whole root.</p>
<p>3. TO RETURN INTO EGYPT. <italic>Shuv</italic> (to return) is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn888">4</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>kum</italic> (to stand)<sup><xref rid="fn889">5</xref></sup> in <italic>I am not able to stand</italic> (Lam. 1:14) and <italic>kum</italic> (rising up) in <italic>And the king, against whom there is no rising up</italic> (Prov. 30:31).</p>
<p>4. THEN MOSES&#x2026;FELL. By his own will.<sup><xref rid="fn890">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN. Moses mentions Joshua first<sup><xref rid="fn891">7</xref></sup> out of regard for Joshua&#x2019;s elevated status.</p>
<p>9. FOR THEY ARE BREAD. We will eat them like bread. <italic>Who eat up My people as they eat bread</italic> (Ps. 14:4) is similar.</p>
<p>THEIR DEFENSE IS REMOVED FROM OVER THEM.<sup><xref rid="fn892">8</xref></sup> For the heart of a warrior frets when he does not have a shield to protect him and to serve as a shade for him.<sup><xref rid="fn893">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. BADE STONE THEM. Joshua and Caleb.</p>
<p>11. DESPISE ME. <italic>Yena&#x2019;atzuni</italic> (despise me) means anger me. It has many cognates in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn894">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture employs the singular <italic>be-kirbo</italic> (among them)<sup><xref rid="fn895">11</xref></sup> because at first they were united to do good.</p>
<p>13. WHEN THE EGYPTIANS SHALL HEAR&#x2013;FOR THOU BROUGHTEST UP THIS PEOPLE. The meaning of <italic>ki he&#x2019;elita</italic> (for thou broughtest up) is: that you brought up.<sup><xref rid="fn896">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Scripture states, <italic>When the Egyptians shall hear</italic> (ve-shame&#x2019;u)&#x2026;they <italic>will say to the inhabitants of this land</italic>, the reference being to the land of Canaan, it goes on to explain<sup><xref rid="fn897">13</xref></sup> what the Egyptians heard. Scripture therefore repeats the word <italic>shame&#x2019;u</italic> (have heard) and states they <italic>have heard</italic> (shame&#x2019;u) <italic>that Thou Lord</italic> [Thy glory] <italic>art in the midst of this people</italic> (v. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn898">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. ART SEEN FACE TO FACE. The reference is to the glory which the elders saw (Ex. 24:9,10), or to <italic>the appearance of the glory of the Lord&#x2026;in the eyes of the children of Israel</italic> (Ex. 24:17). The latter is correct.</p>
<p>ART SEEN. The word <italic>nirah</italic> (seen) is a verb in the perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn899">15</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>attah Adonai nirah</italic> is, Thou Lord were seen.<sup><xref rid="fn900">16</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-nishar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn901">17</xref></sup> <italic>ani</italic> (and I was left) (Ezek. 9: 8) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn902">18</xref></sup> So is <italic>ki umlal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn903">19</xref></sup> <italic>ani</italic><sup><xref rid="fn904">20</xref></sup> (for I languish away) (Ps. 6:3), because the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>umlal</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn905">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>STANDETH OVER THEM. When they camp.</p>
<p>15. THEN THE NATIONS WHICH HAVE HEARD THE FAME OF THEE. The reference is to Egypt. Also to the Canaanites and other nations.<sup><xref rid="fn906">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. ABLE. The word <italic>yekholet</italic> (able) is a noun. It is similar to the word <italic>yevoshet</italic> (dried up) in <italic>until the waters were dried up</italic> (Gen. 8:7). It does not mean a measure as in the midrashic interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn907">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEREFORE HE HATH SLAIN THEM IN THE WILDERNESS. The meaning of <italic>va-yishchatem</italic> is, He hath slain them. Scripture employs the term <italic>va-yishchatem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn908">24</xref></sup> because sheep graze in the wilderness.</p>
<p>17. LET THE POWER OF THE LORD BE GREAT. <italic>Let the</italic> power&#x2026;be <italic>great</italic> connotes being slow to anger, for all who are long-suffering have the great power to break their anger. <italic>As Thou hast spoken</italic>, that you are slow to anger<sup><xref rid="fn909">25</xref></sup> is proof of this. I have explained these attributes<sup><xref rid="fn910">26</xref></sup> in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic>.</p>
<p>19. PARDON, I PRAY THEE. Since we find Scripture saying <italic>surely they shall not see the land</italic> (v. 23) after <italic>salachti ke-devarekha</italic> (I have pardoned according to thy word) (v. 20), we learn that the term <italic>salach</italic> (pardon) refers to being slow to anger.<sup><xref rid="fn911">27</xref></sup> Similarly, the meaning of <italic>ve-nislach lo</italic> (and he shall be forgiven) (Num 15:28) is [the punishment shall be held in abeyance] until he fully repents.<sup><xref rid="fn912">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>ACCORDING UNTO THE GREATNESS OF THY LOVINGKINDNESS. The meaning of <italic>ke-godel chasdekha</italic> (according to the greatness of Thy lovingkindness) is: because of Thy great lovingkindness.<sup><xref rid="fn913">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ACCORDING AS THOU HAST FORGIVEN. The word <italic>nasata</italic> (Thou hast forgiven) is similar to the word <italic>nose</italic> (forgiving) in <italic>forgiving sin</italic> (Ex. 34:7).</p>
<p>EVEN UNTIL NOW. Until this place or from the day that they left Egypt until this very day, for the word <italic>hennah</italic> (now) can refer to a place or to a specific time. Compare, <italic>there came men in hither</italic> (hennah) (Josh. 2:2) and, <italic>and I have not seen him until now</italic> (hennah) (Gen. 44:28).<sup><xref rid="fn914">30</xref></sup> I have already explained this term.<sup><xref rid="fn915">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AS I LIVE. It means as I live, so shall My word come to pass.<sup><xref rid="fn916">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL BE FILLED WITH THE GLORY. As My glory fills the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn917">33</xref></sup> However, it most probably refers to the future.<sup><xref rid="fn918">34</xref></sup> Its meaning is, I shall do this so that my glory shall be known in the world.<sup><xref rid="fn919">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. THESE TEN TIMES. The meaning is, these many times. Scripture mentions ten because it is most important. It is the end of the one numbers and the first of the ten numbers in the second series of numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn920">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. ANY OF THEM THAT DESPISED ME. From among their children.<sup><xref rid="fn921">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. BUT MY SERVANT CALEB. Caleb alone<sup><xref rid="fn922">38</xref></sup> is mentioned because he <italic>stilled the people</italic> (Num. 13:30). The Levites and the <italic>kohanim</italic> are not included in the oath,<sup><xref rid="fn923">39</xref></sup> for no prince from among them went to spy out the land. Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number</italic> (v. 29).<sup><xref rid="fn924">40</xref></sup> Now even though there were no <italic>kohanim</italic> there,<sup><xref rid="fn925">41</xref></sup> there were in reality many Levites there.<sup><xref rid="fn926">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>ANOTHER SPIRIT. In contrast to the spies.</p>
<p>AND HATH FOLLOWED ME FULLY. He did not he but pursued my word and confirmed it by saying that the land is very good.</p>
<p>25. NOW THE AMALEKITE AND THE CANAANITE. The Canaanite refers to the Amorite, for every Amorite is a Canaanite.<sup><xref rid="fn927">43</xref></sup> Scripture does not bother to mention the Amorite by name because the other nation mentioned is the Amalekite, who is of the children of Shem.<sup><xref rid="fn928">44</xref></sup> On the other hand, Canaan, who is the father of the Amorite,<sup><xref rid="fn929">45</xref></sup> is of the children of Ham.<sup><xref rid="fn930">46</xref></sup> <italic>Then the Amalekite and the Canaanite&#x2026;came down</italic> (Num. 14:45) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn931">47</xref></sup> <italic>And the Amorites&#x2026;came out</italic> (Deut. 1:44)<sup><xref rid="fn932">48</xref></sup> is proof of this. Scripture does not mention the Amalekite in the aforementioned verse, as the Amorite was the more important.<sup><xref rid="fn933">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>DWELT IN THE VALE. To ambush you. Others say that the meaning of our verse is, even though the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley, turn toward the way of the Red Sea and do not fear.<sup><xref rid="fn934">50</xref></sup> Now the Israelites did not repent, hence God&#x2019;s word.<sup><xref rid="fn935">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. YOUR CARCASSES. The meaning of <italic>pigrekhem</italic> is your dead bodies.</p>
<p>HAVE MURMURED. <italic>Halinotem</italic> (have murmured) is related to the word <italic>va-yallinu</italic> (murmured) in <italic>and&#x2026;murmured against Moses</italic> (v. 2).</p>
<p>30. CONCERNING WHICH I LIFTED UP MY HAND. Scripture speaks as humans do, for the sky is above.<sup><xref rid="fn936">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Caleb is mentioned first<sup><xref rid="fn937">53</xref></sup> because he acted before anyone else to quiet the people.</p>
<p>32. YOUR CARCASSES.<sup><xref rid="fn938">54</xref></sup> Namely, you.</p>
<p>33. SHALL BE WANDERERS.<sup><xref rid="fn939">55</xref></sup> For it is the way of shepherds not to remain and rest in one place.<sup><xref rid="fn940">56</xref></sup> <italic>My habitation is plucked up and carried away from me As a shepherd&#x2019;s tent</italic> (Is. 38:12) is proof of this.</p>
<p>YOUR STRAYINGS. For you turned away from me and said, <italic>Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt</italic> (Num. 14:4).</p>
<p>34. WHICH YE SPIED OUT. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn941">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>MY DISPLEASURE.<sup><xref rid="fn942">58</xref></sup> I will break my word.<sup><xref rid="fn943">59</xref></sup> Or, it means<sup><xref rid="fn944">60</xref></sup> who shall break Me; that is, who shall break My oath.<sup><xref rid="fn945">61</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>But if her father break</italic> (heni) <italic>her</italic> (Num 30:6).</p>
<p>35. THAT ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST ME. For they wanted to stone<sup><xref rid="fn946">62</xref></sup> the servants of God<sup><xref rid="fn947">63</xref></sup> because they spoke of God&#x2019;s glory.<sup><xref rid="fn948">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THIS WILDERNESS. The time set for each one shall come to an end, for God has set a specific time for everyone&#x2019;s death.<sup><xref rid="fn949">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THERE THEY SHALL DIE. All of them, close to the time set by God.<sup><xref rid="fn950">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. And&#x2026;MADE ALL THE CONGREGATION TO MURMUR AGAINST HIM. <italic>Va-yillonu</italic> (and made to murmur) is a <italic>hifil</italic>.</p>
<p>37. DIED. <italic>Va-yamutu</italic> (died) is to interpreted as if written <italic>metu</italic> (died).<sup><xref rid="fn951">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>BY THE PLAGUE. All together.<sup><xref rid="fn952">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. BUT JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN. These are the words of Moses. He<sup><xref rid="fn953">69</xref></sup> mentions Joshua before Caleb.</p>
<p>41. SEEING IT SHALL NOT PROSPER. The ascent of the mountain will not prosper. Or, the violation of God&#x2019;s command cannot prosper.</p>
<p>43. FORASMUCH AS YE ARE TURNED BACK. <italic>Ki al ken shavtem</italic> (forasmuch as ye are turned back) means, since you turned back.<sup><xref rid="fn954">70</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>since</italic> (ki al ken) <italic>I gave her not</italic> (Gen. 38:26).</p>
<p>44. BUT THEY PRESUMED TO GO UP. <italic>Va-yapilu</italic> (but they presumed) is related to the word <italic>ofel</italic> (mound) in <italic>the mound and the tower</italic> (Is. 32:14). The meaning of <italic>va-yapilu</italic> is, they went up the hill.</p>
<p>45. AND BEAT THEM DOWN. Rabbi Moses the Spaniard, of blessed memory, says that our text<sup><xref rid="fn955">71</xref></sup> should have read <italic>va-yakkitum</italic> (and beat them down).<sup><xref rid="fn956">72</xref></sup> <italic>Va-yadbeku</italic> (followed hard) in <italic>even they also followed hard after them</italic> (I Sam. 14:22) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn957">73</xref></sup> However, I believe that <italic>va-yakketum</italic> (and beat them down) comes from a double root<sup><xref rid="fn958">74</xref></sup> and is an irregular word.<sup><xref rid="fn959">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVEN UNTO HORMAH. Hormah is the name of a place. Others say that the meaning of <italic>even unto Hormah</italic> is, until they destroyed them.<sup><xref rid="fn960">76</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn885"><sup>1</sup> Literally, and gave.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn886"><sup>2</sup> I.E. reads this verse as follows: And all the congregation lifted up their voice and gave their voice (i.e., they cried).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn887"><sup>3</sup> Its root is <italic>lamed, vav, nun</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn888"><sup>4</sup> <italic>Shuv</italic> can also be an imperative. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn889"><sup>5</sup> Which is an infinitive, even though the word <italic>kum</italic> can also be an imperative.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn890"><sup>6</sup> And not as a result of a prophetic trance (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn891"><sup>7</sup> Even though in the list of the spies, Caleb is mentioned first. See Num. 13:6-8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn892"><sup>8</sup> Literally, their shadow is removed from over them. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn893"><sup>9</sup> In other words, their shadow means their shield. Thus according to I.E. our clause should be understood: their shield is removed from over them; that is, they have no confidence to fight us and they will not confront us with a sword and shield. See Nachmanides on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn894"><sup>10</sup> This word is found many times in Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn895"><sup>11</sup> The word <italic>be-kirbo</italic> (among them) literally means among him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn896"><sup>12</sup> <italic>Ki he&#x2019;elita</italic> is to be interpreted as if written <italic>asher he&#x2019;elita</italic>. In other words, the <italic>ki</italic> (for) in our verse is to be rendered <italic>asher</italic> (that).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn897"><sup>13</sup> In verse 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn898"><sup>14</sup> In other words, the word <italic>shame&#x2019;u</italic> in verse 14 picks up the thought which was interrupted by <italic>they will say to the inhabitants of the land</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn899"><sup>15</sup> It is a third person perfect. Its meaning is, he was seen.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn901"><sup>17</sup> <italic>Nishar</italic> is a third person perfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn902"><sup>18</sup> In that we have an anomalous combination of a pronoun and a verb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn903"><sup>19</sup> <italic>Umlal</italic> is a third person perfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn904"><sup>20</sup> <italic>Ani</italic> is a first person pronoun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn905"><sup>21</sup> The <italic>pattach</italic> indicates that <italic>umlal</italic> is a third person perfect. However, see I.E. on Psalms 6:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn906"><sup>22</sup> In other words, the reference is to the Egyptians, Canaanites, and other nations who heard of God&#x2019;s fame.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn907"><sup>23</sup> A Midrash connects the word <italic>yekholet</italic> to the word <italic>yakhil</italic> (held a measure). See Kings I 7:26. According to Krinsky the reference is to <italic>Midrash Tanhumah</italic> on our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn908"><sup>24</sup> Which usually applies to the slaughter of cattle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn909"><sup>25</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of <italic>As Thou hast spoken, saying</italic> (v. 17): <italic>The Lord is slow to anger</italic> (v. 18).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn910"><sup>26</sup> The attributes mentioned in verse 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn911"><sup>27</sup> If <italic>salach</italic> meant full pardon, then (he people would have been permitted to enter the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn912"><sup>28</sup> <italic>Salach</italic> in all cases means that punishment is not meted out immediately but is delayed. In the case of Num. 15:28, a sacrifice delays punishment and the person is pardoned if he truly repents.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn913"><sup>29</sup> The <italic>kof</italic> usually has the meaning of like or according. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that here it means because of.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn914"><sup>30</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn915"><sup>31</sup> That <italic>hennah</italic> in Gen 44:28 refers to time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn916"><sup>32</sup> In other words, <italic>As I live</italic> is short for, As I live, so shall my word come to pass.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn917"><sup>33</sup> In other words, <italic>yimmale</italic> (shall be filled) is to be taken as a present. Thus the meaning of our clause is, and all the earth is filled with the glory of the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn918"><sup>34</sup> For <italic>yimmale</italic> is an imperfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn919"><sup>35</sup> According to this interpretation the meaning of our clause is: and all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn920"><sup>36</sup> 10,20,30, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn921"><sup>37</sup> If any of their children will follow in their footsteps (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn922"><sup>38</sup> Joshua, the <italic>kohanim</italic>, and Levites are not mentioned in this verse even though they entered the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn923"><sup>39</sup> Mentioned in verses 21-23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn924"><sup>40</sup> Scripture explicitly states that God&#x2019;s decree was limited to those who were numbered. Since the <italic>kohanim</italic> and the Levites were not among those numbered (Num. 1:49), God&#x2019;s decree did not apply to them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn925"><sup>41</sup> Thus there was no reason to exclude them in verse 29. By no <italic>kohanim</italic> I.E. means few <italic>kohanim</italic>, for Aaron and his sons were there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn926"><sup>42</sup> There were 8,580 Levites above the age of 30. See Num. 4:47,48. Hence Scripture excludes them in verse 29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn927"><sup>43</sup> The Amorites are descended from Canaan. See Gen. 10:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn928"><sup>44</sup> Scripture distinguishes between the Canaanite nations when it speaks of the Canaanites <italic>per se</italic>. However, when it speaks of one of the Canaanite nations along with a non-Canaanite nation, it does not mention its specific name but uses its general name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn929"><sup>45</sup> Hence the term Canaanite includes the Amorites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn930"><sup>46</sup> The Canaanite is mentioned by name and not called the Hammite because Ham had other sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn931"><sup>47</sup> There too the reference is to the Amorite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn932"><sup>48</sup> The reference is to the same incident as that in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn933"><sup>49</sup> The Amorite carried the brunt of the battle (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn934"><sup>50</sup> That the Canaanites and Amalekites shall pursue you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn935"><sup>51</sup> Do not go up for the Lord is not in your midst (v. 42). I.E. believed that verses 39 and 40 do not imply that Israel repented.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn936"><sup>52</sup> Hence one raises his hand towards heaven when he takes an oath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn937"><sup>53</sup> Before Joshua.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn938"><sup>54</sup> Hebrew, <italic>u-figrekhem attem</italic>. Literally, and your carcasses, you. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that the aforementioned is to be interpreted, and your carcasses, namely, you. In other words, Scripture is being explicit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn939"><sup>55</sup> Hebrew, <italic>yiheyu ro&#x2019;im</italic>. Literally, will shepherd. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn943"><sup>59</sup> My promise to bring the generation that left Egypt to Canaan. See Ex. 6:8. <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads: If I will break My word. In this case, the reference is to God&#x2019;s oath, which He took not to bring the generation that left Egypt into Canaan. In view of the belief of I.E. that God is unchangeable (see his comments on Gen. 6:6, Vol. 1, p. 96), the reading of <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 appears correct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn944"><sup>60</sup> The meaning of <italic>tenu&#x2019;ati</italic>, My breaking.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn945"><sup>61</sup> The oath which I took not to allow you to enter the land of Canaan.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn949"><sup>65</sup> The Hebrew verse reads, <italic>ba-midbar ha-zeh yittamu</italic> (in this wilderness they shall be consumed). <italic>Ba-midbar ha-zeh yittamu</italic> literally means, in this wilderness they shall be finished.

<ftnote id="fn950"><sup>66</sup> The days of the entire generation shall be completed close to the forty-year period set by God for their sojourn in the desert. In others words, the entire generation shall die in about forty years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn951"><sup>67</sup> <italic>Va-yamutu</italic> (died) means and they died. Like all verbs with a conversive <italic>vav</italic>, it usually opens a new clause. However, the context indicates that verse 37 does not open a new clause. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn952"><sup>68</sup> Unlike the generation that died in the wilderness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn953"><sup>69</sup> Unlike God. See verse 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn954"><sup>70</sup> In other words, <italic>ki al ken</italic> means since. The literal meaning of <italic>ki al ken</italic> is &#x201C;for on yes.&#x201D; Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn955"><sup>71</sup> Which reads <italic>va-yakketum</italic> (and beat them down).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn956"><sup>72</sup> For the word is a <italic>hifil</italic> from the root <italic>nun, kaf, tav</italic>. Rabbi Moses is only commenting on the irregularity of <italic>va-yakketum</italic>. The meaning remains the same.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 15</title>
<p>1. WHEN YE ARE COME INTO THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS. This chapter follows [the one dealing with the spies] in order to console the children by informing them that they would enter the land, for the Israelites grew weak and mourned.<sup><xref rid="fn961">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the real reason that this chapter follows the one dealing with the spies, is because all the congregation shouted and sinned.<sup><xref rid="fn962">2</xref></sup> God forgave their sin because of the prayer of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn963">3</xref></sup> Scripture says, <italic>And when ye shall err</italic> (15:22).<sup><xref rid="fn964">4</xref></sup> <italic>And they shall be forgiven</italic> (15:25) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn965">5</xref></sup> Scripture found it necessary to mention the law of the meal offering and of all burnt offerings and sacrifices.<sup><xref rid="fn966">6</xref></sup> At the end,<sup><xref rid="fn967">7</xref></sup> it states, <italic>But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand</italic> (v. 30). The latter alludes to Israel&#x2019;s deeds.<sup><xref rid="fn968">8</xref></sup> Scripture mentions the gatherer of wood (verses 32-34)<sup><xref rid="fn969">9</xref></sup> because he acted with a high hand. God designated the fringes as a sign<sup><xref rid="fn970">10</xref></sup> because of His great pity on Israel, so that a person will not act with a high hand or<sup><xref rid="fn971">11</xref></sup> forget.<sup><xref rid="fn972">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. CLEARLY UTTERED. <italic>Le-fale</italic> (clearly uttered) means to separate.<sup><xref rid="fn973">13</xref></sup> Similarly the word <italic>ve-hiflah</italic> (shall make a division) in <italic>And the Lord shall make a division</italic> (Ex. 9:4). This is so even though <italic>ve-hiflah</italic> is spelled with a <italic>heh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn974">14</xref></sup> for the letters <italic>alef, heh, vav, yod</italic> interchange.</p>
<p>9.<sup><xref rid="fn975">15</xref></sup> A MEAL-OFFERING OF&#x2026;FINE FLOUR. A tenth of an ephah for each one of the flock.<sup><xref rid="fn976">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THE HE-LAMBS. Or the kids.<sup><xref rid="fn977">17</xref></sup> Scripture similarly states later, <italic>for each lamb</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn978">18</xref></sup> If the celebrant offers a ram, then his meal offering is doubled,<sup><xref rid="fn979">19</xref></sup> for a lamb is a small animal.</p>
<p>Scripture does not mention the free-will offering<sup><xref rid="fn980">20</xref></sup> along with the bullock.<sup><xref rid="fn981">21</xref></sup> It mentions the peace offering<sup><xref rid="fn982">22</xref></sup> [with the bullock] because it did not mention it above.<sup><xref rid="fn983">23</xref></sup> They all have one law.<sup><xref rid="fn984">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. [ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER.] The reference is to the meal offering, the oil, and the wine.</p>
<p>14. OR WHOSOEVER MAY BE AMONG YOU. Today.<sup><xref rid="fn985">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AS FOR THE CONGREGATION. Some say that the <italic>heh</italic> prefixed to the word <italic>kahal</italic> (congregation) is the sign of the vocative.<sup><xref rid="fn986">26</xref></sup> However, I believe that there is no vocative letter in the holy tongue. The four instances<sup><xref rid="fn987">27</xref></sup> are proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn988">28</xref></sup> One of them is <italic>Moses, Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn989">29</xref></sup> On the contrary, this <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn990">30</xref></sup> is the sign of the definite object.<sup><xref rid="fn991">31</xref></sup> It is not a sign of the vocative.</p>
<p>AS YE ARE, SO SHALL THE STRANGER BE. I have already explained the rule governing two <italic>kafs</italic> joined together.<sup><xref rid="fn992">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. [ONE LAW.] Its meaning is, one law aside from the burnt offerings, for the burnt offerings are obligated by statute.<sup><xref rid="fn993">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>God also says,<sup><xref rid="fn994">34</xref></sup> as you bring a meal offering of fine flour along with the burnt offering, thus shall you do with your dough.<sup><xref rid="fn995">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no need to mention what our ancients, of blessed memory, received by tradition, namely, that one is obligated to set aside two offerings, a portion of the dough<sup><xref rid="fn996">36</xref></sup> and a portion of the grain,<sup><xref rid="fn997">37</xref></sup> and their amount.<sup><xref rid="fn998">38</xref></sup> Their words are true. Everything else is nonsense.</p>
<p>24. [ONE HE-GOAT.] Scripture adds a he-goat.<sup><xref rid="fn999">39</xref></sup> The congregation must bring a sin offering whether they erred by doing something they were prohibited from doing or erred in not doing something they were obligated to do.</p>
<p>25. AND THEIR SIN-OFFERING. The reference is to the he-goat.<sup><xref rid="fn1000">40</xref></sup> A <italic>sei&#x2019;r izzim</italic> (he-goat) refers to a young goat because the word <italic>se&#x2019;ir</italic> (he-goat) is connected to <italic>izzim</italic> (goats). The reverse is the case with the term <italic>atud</italic> (he-goat).<sup><xref rid="fn1001">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. A SHE-GOAT OF THE FIRST YEAR FOR A SIN-OFFERING. This explains <italic>a goat, a female</italic> (Lev. 4:28).<sup><xref rid="fn1002">42</xref></sup> The sin spoken of in our verse refers to a failure, due to error, to do what the Torah commands.<sup><xref rid="fn1003">43</xref></sup> Now this law is the same for the one who errs and does what he is commanded not to do.<sup><xref rid="fn1004">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. ONE LAW.<sup><xref rid="fn1005">45</xref></sup> This is similar to <italic>This is the law of</italic> (torat) <italic>the sin-offering</italic> (Lev. 6:18).<sup><xref rid="fn1006">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. WITH A HIGH HAND. To show all that he does not fear God.</p>
<p>BLASPHEMETH. This is the way people speak.<sup><xref rid="fn1007">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. BECAUSE HE HATH DESPISED THE WORD OF THE LORD. This is what <italic>with a high hand</italic> refers to.</p>
<p>AND HATH BROKEN HIS COMMANDMENT. For God commanded him not to act with a high hand. Others say that <italic>and hath broken His commandment</italic> refers to one who violates God&#x2019;s commandment in secret.</p>
<p>THAT SOUL. This does not refer to the rational soul.<sup><xref rid="fn1008">48</xref></sup> as those who err say.<sup><xref rid="fn1009">49</xref></sup> It refers rather to the connection of the soul to the body.<sup><xref rid="fn1010">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIS INIQUITY SHALL BE UPON HIM. Compare, <italic>his blood shall be upon him</italic> (Ezek. 33:4).</p>
<p>32. IN THE WILDERNESS. I believe that the reference is to the wilderness of Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn1011">51</xref></sup> I have already mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn1012">52</xref></sup> why this chapter follows the incident of the spies.<sup><xref rid="fn1013">53</xref></sup> It is also possible that the gatherer of wood acted with a high hand<sup><xref rid="fn1014">54</xref></sup> and they warned him,<sup><xref rid="fn1015">55</xref></sup> but to no avail.<sup><xref rid="fn1016">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>[33. BROUGHT HIM.] Some say they brought him in on Saturday night.<sup><xref rid="fn1017">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. IN WARD. <italic>Ba-mishmar</italic> (in ward) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1018">58</xref></sup> It refers to a specific place.<sup><xref rid="fn1019">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO HIM. How he should be put to death.<sup><xref rid="fn1020">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. AS THE LORD COMMANDED. Death by stoning.</p>
<p>38. THAT THEY MAKE THEM&#x2026;FRINGES.<sup><xref rid="fn1021">61</xref></sup> It is possible to interpret this in two ways. One, that they make fringes (<italic>tzitzit</italic>) like those in <italic>by the fringes</italic> (be-tzitzit)<sup><xref rid="fn1022">62</xref></sup> <italic>of my head</italic> (Ezek. 8:3),<sup><xref rid="fn1023">63</xref></sup> the reference in our verse being to threads that are not woven.<sup><xref rid="fn1024">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE CORNERS OF THEIR GARMENTS. Upon smooth garments<sup><xref rid="fn1025">65</xref></sup> or pants,<sup><xref rid="fn1026">66</xref></sup> for if pants are divided they will have corners.<sup><xref rid="fn1027">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>A THREAD OF BLUE. Upon the fringes. The reason the thread was blue is that blue is a sky-like color.</p>
<p>39. AND IT SHALL BE UNTO YOU FOR A FRINGE. The thread at the end was like the fringe.<sup><xref rid="fn1028">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>The other interpretation is the one which the rabbis of blessed memory transmitted.<sup><xref rid="fn1029">69</xref></sup> Now the first interpretation is nullified in view of the fact that there are true witnesses<sup><xref rid="fn1030">70</xref></sup> to the second explanation. The rabbis transmitted to us the law that this commandment applies to a garment that has four corners and that the tzitzit are fringes.<sup><xref rid="fn1031">71</xref></sup> I will explain this law later.<sup><xref rid="fn1032">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now this commandment states that everyone who has a four-cornered garment shall always cover himself with it during the day. He shall not remove it so that he remembers<sup><xref rid="fn1033">73</xref></sup> the commandments. Those who pray with a <italic>tallit</italic> during the time of prayers do so because they read in the <italic>shema</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1034">74</xref></sup> <italic>And it shall be unto you for a fringe</italic> (v. 39) and <italic>that they make them throughout their generations fringes</italic> (v. 30).</p>
<p>However, I believe that one is more obligated to enwrap oneself in fringes when he is not at prayer than during the time of prayer, so that he remembers the commandments and does not err and trespass during the other hours of the day, for in the hour of prayer he will not sin.<sup><xref rid="fn1035">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT YE MAY LOOK UPON IT. The commandment requires that the fringes be seen.</p>
<p>AFTER YOUR OWN HEART. Which lusts. The eye sees and the heart desires. The fringes thus serve as a sign and a mark that a person should not pursue the thoughts of his heart and all that his eyes desire.</p>
<p>AFTER WHICH YE USE TO GO ASTRAY. For one who follows his desires goes astray from the service of his God.</p>
<p>40. THAT YE MAY REMEMBER. Scripture has previously stated, <italic>and remember all the commandments of the Lord</italic> (v. 39).<sup><xref rid="fn1036">76</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: if you remember the commandments of God, you will be holy and you will not defile yourselves with the lusts of the heart which defile the rational soul.<sup><xref rid="fn1037">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD. I am He who took you out of Egypt to be your God. I therefore say to you: <italic>I am the Lord your God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1038">78</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn961"><sup>1</sup> See Num. 14:39. This interpretation is found in Rashi.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn964"><sup>4</sup> Which is precisely what Israel had just done.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn965"><sup>5</sup> The theme connecting the chapters is atonement for sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn966"><sup>6</sup> Since Scripture mentioned the sin offering and its accompanying meal and drink offering, it felt compelled to mention the same regarding the burnt and other offerings.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn973"><sup>13</sup> According to I.E., <italic>le-fale neder</italic> (in fulfillment of a vow clearly uttered) is to be rendered, in fulfillment of a vow set aside.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn974"><sup>14</sup> And <italic>le-fale</italic> is spelled with an <italic>alef</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn975"><sup>15</sup> The printed texts have verse 9. However, the reference appears to be to verse 4, for verse 8 speaks of the herd while verse 3 speaks of the herd and the flock. Furthermore, verse 4 speaks of a tenth of an ephah and verse 9 does not.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn976"><sup>16</sup> Mentioned in the previous verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn977"><sup>17</sup> This comment as it stands appears very difficult. First of all, what is I.E. adding to the Scriptural text, which reads: <italic>for each of the he-lambs, or of the kids?</italic> Furthermore, I.E. goes on to say, &#x201C;Scripture similarly states at the end, <italic>for each lamb</italic>.&#x201D; We do not find the phrase <italic>for each lamb</italic> in any of the following verses. Filwarg suggests that the heading verse 11 is an error and should be eliminated and that our note is a continuation of the previous one. It should read as follows:</ftnote>
<ftnote>[Verse 4.] A MEAL-OFFERING OF&#x2026;FINE FLOUR. A tenth of an ephah for each one of the flock, (that is) he-lambs or kids. Scripture similarly states at the end (of the verse), <italic>for each lamb</italic> (v. 5). See note 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn978"><sup>18</sup> We thus see that the term flock refers to lambs (and by extension also to kids).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn979"><sup>19</sup> Verse 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn980"><sup>20</sup> Hebrew, <italic>nedavah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn981"><sup>21</sup> In verse 8. It does so in verse 3. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn982"><sup>22</sup> Hebrew, <italic>shelamim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn983"><sup>23</sup> In verse 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn984"><sup>24</sup> The <italic>neder</italic> (vow) mentioned in verses 3 and 8 and the <italic>nedavah</italic> (free-will offering) mentioned in verse 3 all have one law. They are considered as <italic>shelamim</italic> (peace offerings). See Lev. 7:16-20 (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn985"><sup>25</sup> According to I.E., <italic>or whosoever may be among you, throughout your generations</italic> should be interpreted as: or whosoever be among you today or throughout your generations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn986"><sup>26</sup> According to this interpretation our verse reads: O congregation (<italic>ha-kahal</italic>), there shall be one statute both for you, and for the stranger.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn987"><sup>27</sup> Where a common noun is repeated. They are: Moses, Moses (Ex. 3:4); Abraham, Abraham (Gen. 22:11); Jacob, Jacob (Gen. 46:2); Samuel, Samuel (I Sam. 3:1).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn988"><sup>28</sup> That there is no vocative <italic>heh</italic>, otherwise why repeat the common noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn989"><sup>29</sup> Ex. 3:4. I.E. probably quotes <italic>Moses, Moses</italic> as an example because he is expounding the Book of Numbers, and Moses is the central human character.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn990"><sup>30</sup> The <italic>heh</italic> prefixed to <italic>kahal</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn991"><sup>31</sup> Thus the meaning of <italic>ha-kahal</italic> is, the congregation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn992"><sup>32</sup> According to I.E. when two <italic>kafs</italic> are affixed to two words following each other it indicates an abridged clause. Thus our verse, which states <italic>ka-khem ka-ger</italic> (as you are, so shall the stranger be) is to be interpreted: as you are, so shall the stranger be; as the stranger is, so shall you be. See I.E. on Gen. 44:18 (Vol. 1, p. 396).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn993"><sup>33</sup> For that is what the word <italic>chukkah</italic> (statute) refers to. Verse 15 states, <italic>there shall be one statute</italic> (chukkah) <italic>both for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you</italic>. Verse 16 states, <italic>One law</italic> (Torah) <italic>and one ordinance shall be both for you, and for the stranger. Prima facie</italic>, Scripture is redundant. Hence I.E. comments that verse 15 deals with that which is obligatory, namely, the burnt offering (for it concludes the law mentioned in verse 14, which deals with sacrifices), and verse 16 deals with all the other commandments, for it speaks of Torah (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn994"><sup>34</sup> In verses 19-21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn995"><sup>35</sup> One must set aside a portion of one&#x2019;s dough as a gift unto God. Hence the law of <italic>hallah</italic> follows the law of the meal offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn996"><sup>36</sup> <italic>Hallah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn997"><sup>37</sup> <italic>Terumah</italic>. In other words, one has to set aside a portion from the dough, even though he has already set aside a portion from the grain out of which this very dough was made (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn998"><sup>38</sup> How much one has to set aside.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn999"><sup>39</sup> To the bullock mentioned in Lev. 4:13,14 for the sin committed in error by the congregation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1000"><sup>40</sup> <italic>An offering made by fire unto the Lord</italic> refers to the bullock, <italic>and their sin-offering before the Lord</italic> refers to the he-goat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1001"><sup>41</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. An <italic>atud</italic> is a mature goat. Some texts read <italic>atid</italic> (the future) in place of <italic>atud</italic> (he-goat). However, the latter is practically impossible to explain. See Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1002"><sup>42</sup> Which the Torah in Lev. 4:28 mandates for one who sins through error.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1003"><sup>43</sup> Lev. 4:27-31 deals with one who violates a sin by doing something which the Lord has commanded not to be done. Hence I.E. believes that our verse deals with a failure to observe a positive commandment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1004"><sup>44</sup> In both cases he must bring a goat, a female without blemish.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1005"><sup>45</sup> Hebrew, <italic>torah achat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1006"><sup>46</sup> The word <italic>torah</italic> (law) (rather than <italic>mitzvat, chukkat, mishpat</italic>) is used with regard to the rules of the sacrifices (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1007"><sup>47</sup> People consider a high-handed act against God as blasphemous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1008"><sup>48</sup> I.E. held that man has three souls: vegetative, animal, and rational. See Foreword, Vol. 1, p. XIII.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1009"><sup>49</sup> According to I.E. man&#x2019;s rational soul is immortal if developed by study.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1010"><sup>50</sup> Premature death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1011"><sup>51</sup> For the word <italic>midbar</italic> (wilderness) has the direct article (<italic>ba</italic>) prefixed to it. The reference is thus to &#x201C;the&#x201D; wilderness, which I.E. is certain must refer to Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1012"><sup>52</sup> See I.E. on verse 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1013"><sup>53</sup> Even though this incident preceded the sending of the spies, for the sending of the spies took place after Israel journeyed from Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1014"><sup>54</sup> He deliberately violated God&#x2019;s law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1015"><sup>55</sup> The Bible does not explicitly state that the gatherer of wood was warned. According to Jewish law, however, one cannot be executed for a crime unless one is first warned to desist. Hence I.E. suggests that he was warned but to no avail.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1016"><sup>56</sup> He continued to gather wood on the Sabbath. The Sifre explains similarly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1017"><sup>57</sup> For they would not arrest him on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1018"><sup>58</sup> What I.E. means is that the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ba-mishmar</italic> (in ward) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1019"><sup>59</sup> For the preposition <italic>ba</italic> is the sign of the direct object.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1020"><sup>60</sup> The Torah earlier stated that whoever violates the Sabbath should be put to death (Ex. 35:2). However, it does not state how the culprit should be executed.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1022"><sup>62</sup> That is, the hair.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1023"><sup>63</sup> The second interpretation is given in the next verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1024"><sup>64</sup> According to this interpretation the threads at the corner are not to be woven but are left unfinished, like the hair upon the head. These unfinished threads are to serve as fringes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1025"><sup>65</sup> Such as a sheet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1026"><sup>66</sup> This is still part of the first interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1027"><sup>67</sup> Hence they require fringes now (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1028"><sup>68</sup> The blue thread that was placed on the edge of the garment was to resemble one of the loose hanging threads.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1029"><sup>69</sup> That the fringes are not part of the garment but are attached to the corners of the garment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1030"><sup>70</sup> Jewish practice throughout the ages.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1033"><sup>73</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. <italic>Mikro&#x2019;ot Gedolot</italic> reads, so that they remember.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1034"><sup>74</sup> The <italic>shema</italic> is part of the morning and evening prayers. It consists of Deut. 6:4-9; Deut. 11:13-21; Num. 15:37-41.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1035"><sup>75</sup> &#x201C;Now, the person who envelops himself in a tallit [during prayer] does not fully observe the commandment.

<ftnote id="fn1036"><sup>76</sup> Hence why repeat itself and state in our verse <italic>that ye may remember</italic>.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 16</title>
<h1>KORAH</h1>
<p>1. NOW KORAH, THE SON OF IZHAR&#x2026;TOOK. This event occurred in the wilderness of Sinai when the first-born were set aside<sup><xref rid="fn1039">1</xref></sup> and the Levites were placed in their stead.<sup><xref rid="fn1040">2</xref></sup> Israel thought that our master Moses acted out of his own will in giving his brother an elevated position. They suspected that he acted similarly towards the sons of Kohath, who were his relatives, and to all the sons of Levi who were of his family. The Levites rebelled against Moses because they were subservient to Aaron and his sons.</p>
<p>Dathan and Abiram rebelled because Moses<sup><xref rid="fn1041">3</xref></sup> removed the birthright from Reuben their forefather, and gave it to Joseph. It is also possible that they suspected that Moses favored the tribe of Joseph because Joshua was his assistant.<sup><xref rid="fn1042">4</xref></sup> Korah too was a first-born, as Scripture clearly states.<sup><xref rid="fn1043">5</xref></sup> The banner of Reuben camped in the south.<sup><xref rid="fn1044">6</xref></sup> So did Korah, for he was a Kohathite.<sup><xref rid="fn1045">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The princes of the congregation were first-born. They offered the burnt offering. They therefore took the fire pans. The miracle of the staff,<sup><xref rid="fn1046">8</xref></sup> which demonstrated to all of Israel that God chose the Levites in place of the first-born, is proof that this explanation is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn1047">9</xref></sup> Hence Scripture reads, <italic>that there may be made an end of their murmurings against Me</italic> (Num. 17:25), for the murmuring was an account of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1048">10</xref></sup> Moses also said, <italic>that I have not done them of mine own mind</italic> (v. 28). He said the aforementioned because Israel had come to believe that he had acted on his own. Furthermore, Moses said, <italic>then the Lord hath not sent me</italic> (v. 29) in this thing,<sup><xref rid="fn1049">11</xref></sup> because Israel had come to believe in him.<sup><xref rid="fn1050">12</xref></sup> Here is another rigorous proof: <italic>seeing all the congregation are holy</italic> (v. 3). The aforementioned alludes to the first-born who are holy, for Scripture states, <italic>Sanctify unto Me all the first-born</italic> (Ex. 13:2). The first-born were the priests <italic>that come near to the Lord</italic> (Ex. 19:22). They were the most important ones of the congregation.</p>
<p>NOW KORAH&#x2026;TOOK. This is short for, now Korah took men.<sup><xref rid="fn1051">13</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>an ass bread</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1052">14</xref></sup> (I Sam. 17:20).<sup><xref rid="fn1053">15</xref></sup> There are many such instances in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1054">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jonah says that the meaning of <italic>Now Korah took</italic> is now Korah took himself to rise against Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1055">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. IN THE FACE OF MOSES. They did not rise up in secret. There is a difference between <italic>li-fene</italic> (in the face of) and <italic>mi-pene</italic> (before the face of) (Gen. 3:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1056">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE ELECT MEN OF THE ASSEMBLY. They were called to the tent of meeting.</p>
<p>MEN OF RENOWN. Before they left Egypt.</p>
<p>A grammarian says that <italic>the princes of the congregation</italic> are the leaders who stood over those that were numbered (Num 1:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1057">19</xref></sup> He says that they<sup><xref rid="fn1058">20</xref></sup> are the object of took. Our text should be read as if written, And Korah and Dathan and Abiram and On took the princes of Israel to speak to them.<sup><xref rid="fn1059">21</xref></sup> This interpretation is a bit far-fetched.<sup><xref rid="fn1060">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. YE TAKE TOO MUCH UPON YOU. Enough for you. <sup><xref rid="fn1061">23</xref></sup> Its meaning is, you have grabbed the greater portion.</p>
<p>SEEING ALL THE CONGREGATION ARE HOLY. For the entire congregation became holy from the day they stood on Sinai.</p>
<p>AND THE LORD IS AMONG THEM. For the Levites were chosen after God&#x2019;s glory dwelt amidst the children of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1062">24</xref></sup> Now if Moses knew when he was on Mount Sinai that the tribe of Levi was chosen, Israel did not know.<sup><xref rid="fn1063">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHEREFORE THEN LIFT YE UP YOURSELVES ABOVE THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LORD? For Aaron to be <italic>kohen gadol</italic> (high priest) and Moses, who taught Aaron, to be above him.</p>
<p>4. HE FELL UPON HIS FACE. Willingly. Other say, like prophets when they receive a prophecy.<sup><xref rid="fn1064">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. WHO ARE HIS. Which is the chosen tribe. This was Moses&#x2019; answer to Dathan and Abiram and to the leaders of the congregation who were first-born.</p>
<p>AND WHO IS HOLY. In his tribe to be <italic>kohen gadol</italic>.</p>
<p>6. THIS. Test.<sup><xref rid="fn1065">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. YE TAKE TOO MUCH UPON YOU, YE SONS OF LEVI. The meaning of our clause is found in the following words of Moses: <italic>Is it but a small thing unto you</italic> (v. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn1066">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture says, <italic>And Moses said unto Korah</italic> (v. 8),<sup><xref rid="fn1067">29</xref></sup> for the first statement<sup><xref rid="fn1068">30</xref></sup> was addressed to Korah and to all of his company. However, this one was addressed to the Levites.</p>
<p>9. IS IT BUT A SMALL THING UNTO YOU.<sup><xref rid="fn1069">31</xref></sup> This means is it but a small thing unto you.</p>
<p>BEFORE THE CONGREGATION TO MINISTER UNTO THEM. When they bring their burnt offerings and sacrifices.</p>
<p>10. AND THAT HE HATH BROUGHT THEE NEAR. And when he has brought you and your brothers near, will you seek the priesthood also?<sup><xref rid="fn1070">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THEREFORE. Therefore you and your whole congregation that art gathered together, rebel against the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn1071">33</xref></sup> Its meaning is similar to <italic>And the rulers take counsel together, Against the Lord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1072">34</xref></sup> <italic>and against His anointed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1073">35</xref></sup> (Ps. 2:2). They gathered in order to fight with God. <italic>When they strove against the Lord</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1074">36</xref></sup> (Num. 26:9) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1075">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that the <italic>heh</italic> prefixed to <italic>no&#x2019;adim</italic> (gathered together) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1076">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND AS TO AARON, WHAT IS HE. What is his sin, what did he do?</p>
<p>12. WE WILL NOT COME UP. It is possible that the tent of meeting was on a high place in the middle of the camp.<sup><xref rid="fn1077">39</xref></sup> Scripture therefore says, <italic>Get you up from about</italic> (v. 24). On the other hand, one who goes to serve God or to the chosen place is said to go up.</p>
<p>13. IS IT A SMALL THING. Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey?</p>
<p>Scripture reads, <italic>brought us up</italic>, because Egypt is south of the Land of Israel, and one who comes from Egypt to the land of Canaan is in truth going up.<sup><xref rid="fn1078">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT THOU MUST NEEDS MAKE THYSELF ALSO A PRINCE OVER US. You brought us out of Egypt in order to make yourself a prince over us.</p>
<p>MUST NEEDS MAKE THYSELF A PRINCE OVER US. You and your brother also seek additional positions of power over us.<sup><xref rid="fn1079">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. MOREOVER THOU HAST NOT BROUGHT US UNTO A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. Its meaning is: You brought us out of a good place.<sup><xref rid="fn1080">42</xref></sup> Now if you had brought us to a place which is as good as the place you took us out of, and if you had given us fields and vineyards such as we had in Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn1081">43</xref></sup> and you sought power over us, then we would tolerate it. However, you removed us from a good place, from our fields and vineyards, and you did not bring us to a place as good as the one that you brought us out of. Why then do you seek power?<sup><xref rid="fn1082">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>WILT THOU PUT OUT THE EYES OF THESE MEN? Its meaning is: you want to put out the eyes of these men. This alludes to those who left Egypt. It is as if Korah said, you want to put out their eyes so that they do not see. But what you did is visible to the eyes. Therefore we will not come up. It is metaphoric to say so and so&#x2019;s eyes are closed and he therefore cannot see.<sup><xref rid="fn1083">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn1084">46</xref></sup> is: Do you want to darken the eyes so that they do not see? In other words, you are fooling us. We will not come up.<sup><xref rid="fn1085">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn1086">48</xref></sup> is: even if you put out our eyes we will not go up.</p>
<p>Korah said <italic>of these men</italic> because he spoke in the manner of the unintelligent, who do not want to say anything negative about themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn1087">49</xref></sup> However, I believe that <italic>of these men</italic> alludes to the elders who were with Moses, for Scripture clearly states, <italic>and the elders of Israel followed him</italic> (v. 25).</p>
<p>15. AND MOSES WAS VERY WROTH. With what Korah said.<sup><xref rid="fn1088">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>I have already explained that the burnt offering and the meal offering put off the punishment of the wicked. Dathan and Abiram were important men and offered meal offerings before this event. This is the meaning of <italic>Respect not their offering</italic> and turn to me, for I have not placed a burden upon one ass of their asses.</p>
<p>[I HAVE NOT TAKEN ONE ASS FROM THEM.] I have not placed a burden upon one of their asses.<sup><xref rid="fn1089">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>NEITHER HAVE I HURT ONE OF THEM. In any way.</p>
<p>16. AND MOSES SAID UNTO KORAH. Moses had already said so.<sup><xref rid="fn1090">52</xref></sup> Thus this means: when Moses said to Korah be before God, they took their fire-pan.</p>
<p>TOMORROW. This occurred on the day that Moses called to Dathan and Abiram.<sup><xref rid="fn1091">53</xref></sup> It is possible that he called them earlier. The latter appears correct because Scripture reads, <italic>in the morning</italic> (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn1092">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. WITH MOSES AND AARON. Moses and Aaron with them.<sup><xref rid="fn1093">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. SEPARATE YOURSELVES. For they<sup><xref rid="fn1094">56</xref></sup> were with them in front of the entrance to the tent of meeting.</p>
<p>22. AND THEY FELL UPON THEIR FACES. To pray.</p>
<p>[O GOD.] The term <italic>El</italic> (God) indicates that God has the power to destroy them in a moment.<sup><xref rid="fn1095">57</xref></sup> God is <italic>the God of the spirits</italic>. This<sup><xref rid="fn1096">58</xref></sup> explains the term <italic>El</italic>, for God can destroy them because their spirits are in His hand.</p>
<p>SHALL ONE MAN SIN. The reference<sup><xref rid="fn1097">59</xref></sup> is to <italic>Korah</italic>, who assembled all of the congregation against Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p>There are those who say that the meaning of <italic>O God, the God of the spirits</italic> is: God has the power to investigate human souls, for He is their God. God knows that one man, namely, Korah alone, sinned. He also knows if he [Korah] caused the others to sin.</p>
<p>I believe that <italic>Separate yourselves from among this congregation</italic> refers to Korah and his congregation.<sup><xref rid="fn1098">60</xref></sup> A fire went out and devoured and destroyed them in one moment.</p>
<p>24. THE DWELLING OF KORAH. I believe that Korah had a tent for his household and his wealth. This tent was far from the camp of the Levites. The tents of Dathan and Abiram were close to Korah&#x2019;s tent, for only Levites camped around the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn1099">61</xref></sup> We learn from this verse that the bearer of the banner<sup><xref rid="fn1100">62</xref></sup> camped close to the camp of the Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn1101">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL FOLLOWED HIM. I believe that the reference is to the chosen seventy elders.<sup><xref rid="fn1102">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. AND TOUCH NOTHING OF THEIRS. For if one comes to save their money they will go down to the pit like them.</p>
<p>IN ALL THEIR SINS. Because of all their sins.<sup><xref rid="fn1103">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND THEIR SONS. The reference is to adults.</p>
<p>AND THEIR LITTLE ONES. Male and female minors.</p>
<p>28. TO DO ALL THESE WORKS. To have the Levites take the place of the first-born.</p>
<p>Note, it is a major and grievous act to the one who does not believe that God ordered the first-born to be removed from their position as <italic>kohanim</italic> and to have this status conferred only upon the family of Moses. All of this was done<sup><xref rid="fn1104">66</xref></sup> because of the incident of the golden calf, because <italic>and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings</italic> (Ex. 32:6) speaks of the first-born who offered these sacrifices, for they alone were the <italic>kohanim</italic>. Also, the sons of Levi<sup><xref rid="fn1105">67</xref></sup> killed those who served the calf.<sup><xref rid="fn1106">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a question here.<sup><xref rid="fn1107">69</xref></sup> Its answer is found in the Torah portion which opens with the words <italic>va-yelekh mosheh</italic> (Deut. 31:1).<sup><xref rid="fn1108">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. BUT IF THE LORD MAKE A NEW THING. Some say that the word <italic>beri&#x2019;ah</italic> (a new thing) refers to the bringing forth of something that was never in existence.</p>
<p>I have already explained that the word <italic>beri&#x2019;ah</italic> is related to the word <italic>u-vara</italic> (hack) in <italic>and hack them</italic> (Ezek. 23:47).<sup><xref rid="fn1109">71</xref></sup> Many cities<sup><xref rid="fn1110">72</xref></sup> have been split open, and those who dwelt in them have gone down to the pit.<sup><xref rid="fn1111">73</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>bara</italic> is to cut.<sup><xref rid="fn1112">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE GROUND OPEN HER MOUTH. The word <italic>u-fatzetah</italic> means and opened. Compare, <italic>yiftzeh</italic> (doth open) in <italic>doth open his mouth</italic> (Jud. 35:16).</p>
<p>I have already hinted<sup><xref rid="fn1113">75</xref></sup> that man&#x2019;s highest soul,<sup><xref rid="fn1114">76</xref></sup> which comes from the intermediary world,<sup><xref rid="fn1115">77</xref></sup> employs human language when speaking of things above her,<sup><xref rid="fn1116">78</xref></sup> for the body is its palace.<sup><xref rid="fn1117">79</xref></sup> It similarly employs human language when speaking of things below her.<sup><xref rid="fn1118">80</xref></sup> It does so in order that people understand her.</p>
<p>32. AND THEIR HOUSEHOLDS. This is a general term for their wives, [grown] children, and their little ones.</p>
<p>AND THEIR GOODS.<sup><xref rid="fn1119">81</xref></sup> Which all of them possessed.<sup><xref rid="fn1120">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. SO THEY&#x2026;WENT DOWN. Its meaning is: when they went down, the earth closed and they were not seen.<sup><xref rid="fn1121">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE EARTH CLOSED UPON THEM. The earth itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1122">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY PERISHED. For their children who were to take their place died.<sup><xref rid="fn1123">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. AT THE CRY OF THEM. Because of their cry.<sup><xref rid="fn1124">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. [AND FIFTY MEN.] The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>ha-chamishim</italic> (the fifty) is to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn1125">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that Korah was among the ones who were swallowed. They offer as proof, <italic>And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah</italic> (Num. 26:10). Others say that Korah was burned. They offer, <italic>with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.) as proof. Our sages say that Korah was burned and swallowed.<sup><xref rid="fn1126">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that only the place of Dathan and Abiram split open,<sup><xref rid="fn1127">89</xref></sup> for no other place is mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1128">90</xref></sup> Korah was standing with his fire-pan with Aaron and the leaders of the congregation who were offering incense.<sup><xref rid="fn1129">91</xref></sup> <italic>With Korah</italic> (Num. 26:10) is not connected to <italic>and swallowed them up</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.) but rather to <italic>when that company died</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.). This is the way the aforementioned verse is to be interpreted.</p>
<p>If someone should argue and say, &#x201C;Why isn&#x2019;t Korah mentioned among those who were burned?&#x201D; the answer is: once Scripture mentions that Korah&#x2019;s company, which came to his aid, was burned, it is not necessary to mention Korah. For we know this by arguing from a minor to a major premise.<sup><xref rid="fn1130">92</xref></sup> <italic>Pharaoh&#x2019;s chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea</italic> (Ex. 15:4) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1131">93</xref></sup> Moses does not mention in the song<sup><xref rid="fn1132">94</xref></sup> that Pharaoh drowned. The truth is that Pharaoh drowned, for Scripture explicitly states, <italic>But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea</italic> (Ps. 136:15). The verse <italic>that he fare not as Korah, and as his company</italic> (Num. 17:5) is proof that Korah was among those who were burned.<sup><xref rid="fn1133">95</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn1085"><sup>47</sup> <italic>Prima facie</italic>, this interpretation seems to be identical to the one above.

<ftnote id="fn1100"><sup>62</sup> The tribe that carried the banner. For the banners, see Num. 2:1-34.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1101"><sup>63</sup> Korah&#x2019;s tent was close to the tent of Dathan and Abiram. The Levites camped around the southern, western, and northern sides of the tabernacle (Num. 3:14-38). The Israelites camped around the four sides of the tabernacle (Num. 2:2). The family of Kohath camped on the south side (Num. 3:29). So did the tribe of Reuben (Num. 2:10). Now Korah&#x2019;s tent was close to the tent of Dathan and Abiram, who came from the tribe of Reuben, because the tribe of Reuben bore the banner of the tribes that camped on the south and were thus close to the Levites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1102"><sup>64</sup> See Num. 11:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1103"><sup>65</sup> In other words, the <italic>bet</italic> before the word <italic>be-khol</italic> (in all) is to be rendered because. Thus <italic>be-khol chatotam</italic> (in all their sins) means because of all their sins.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1104"><sup>66</sup> The first-born were removed and the Levites substituted in their place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1105"><sup>67</sup> Alone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1106"><sup>68</sup> The first-born did not join Moses in extirpating the worshippers of the calf. Thus the first-born showed themselves unfit to be <italic>kohanim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1107"><sup>69</sup> It isn&#x2019;t clear what the question is. I believe it to be the issue of God changing His mind. According to medieval Jewish philosophy, God and His mind are one. Thus God&#x2019;s mind is immutable. This being the case, how could He change His mind regarding the fitness of the first-born to serve as priests?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1108"><sup>70</sup> I.E. there explains that God does not change. It is people who do. See I.E. on Deut. 31:16.

An alternative interpretation of I.E. is: The meaning of <italic>bara</italic> is to decree. According to this interpretation I.E. renders <italic>ve-im beri&#x2019;ah yivra Adonai</italic> (but if the Lord make a new thing) as, but if God shall decree.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1122"><sup>84</sup> The verb <italic>va-tekhas</italic> (and closed upon then) literally means and covered. Our clause thus reads, and the earth covered them.

<p>3. EVEN THE FIRE-PANS OF THESE MEN WHO HAVE SINNED. This explains <italic>the fire-pans</italic> (v. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn1134">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND LET THEM BE MADE.<sup><xref rid="fn1135">2</xref></sup> The reference is to the workers.<sup><xref rid="fn1136">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>BEATEN PLATES. Compare, <italic>And they did beat</italic> (ve-yerakke&#x2019;u) <italic>the gold into thin plates</italic> (Ex. 39:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1137">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FOR THEY ARE BECOME HOLY.] <italic>Because they were offered before the Lord</italic> explains <italic>for they are become holy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1138">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT THEY MAY BE A SIGN. A memorial and a mark.<sup><xref rid="fn1139">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND THEY BEAT THEM OUT. The beaters beat them out.<sup><xref rid="fn1140">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AS THE LORD SPOKE UNTO HIM BY THE HAND OF MOSES. <italic>Unto him</italic> (lo) refers to Aaron. Others say that <italic>unto him</italic> refers to Korah.<sup><xref rid="fn1141">8</xref></sup> However, I believe the latter to be farfetched.</p>
<p>6. ON THE MORROW. Of this day, for <italic>mochorat</italic> (morrow) is always connected to the previous day.<sup><xref rid="fn1142">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>YE HAVE KILLED. Its meaning is, what proof is this<sup><xref rid="fn1143">10</xref></sup> that the tribe of Levi is the chosen one, and that Aaron was chosen to be <italic>kohen gadol</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn1144">11</xref></sup> It is possible that those who offered the fire-pans were burned because of your prayer<sup><xref rid="fn1145">12</xref></sup> or through your knowledge of the sciences.<sup><xref rid="fn1146">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. WHEN THE CONGREGATION WAS ASSEMBLED.<sup><xref rid="fn1147">14</xref></sup> Whenever the word <italic>kehillah</italic> (assembly)<sup><xref rid="fn1148">15</xref></sup> is followed by the word <italic>al</italic> (on),<sup><xref rid="fn1149">16</xref></sup> it refers to an assembly for the sake of quarreling.</p>
<p>8. AND MOSES AND AARON CAME. Because they saw that God&#x2019;s glory appeared.</p>
<p>10. GET YOU UP. For they sat in the tabernacle, which was on the high ground in the camp of the Levites, as I explained in my comments on <italic>Get you up</italic> (Num. 16:24).<sup><xref rid="fn1150">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY FELL UPON THEIR FACES. To pray.</p>
<p>11. TAKE THY FIRE-PAN. The reference is to a specific fire-pan.<sup><xref rid="fn1151">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND LAY INCENSE THEREON. Scripture does not say, and lay &#x201C;the&#x201D; incense on.<sup><xref rid="fn1152">19</xref></sup> The intelligent will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn1153">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND CARRY. The word <italic>holekh</italic> (and carry) is an imperative.<sup><xref rid="fn1154">21</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>hoshev</italic> (make to dwell)<sup><xref rid="fn1155">22</xref></sup> in <italic>make thy father&#x2026;to dwell</italic> (Gen. 47:6). <italic>Holekh</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>helikhi</italic> (take away) (Ex. 2:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1156">23</xref></sup> It means bring,<sup><xref rid="fn1157">24</xref></sup> the idea being it<sup><xref rid="fn1158">25</xref></sup> should go with you.</p>
<p>15. [AND AARON RETURNED.] <italic>And Aaron returned</italic> is connected to the section that follows,<sup><xref rid="fn1159">26</xref></sup> even though it is separated.<sup><xref rid="fn1160">27</xref></sup> I have already given you many such examples.<sup><xref rid="fn1161">28</xref></sup> When Aaron returned and the plague was stayed, God spoke.<sup><xref rid="fn1162">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. RODS. Some say that the rod of Levi is not God&#x2019;s rod, for God&#x2019;s rod was already known.<sup><xref rid="fn1163">30</xref></sup> Why then write Aaron&#x2019;s name on it.<sup><xref rid="fn1164">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that the rod<sup><xref rid="fn1165">32</xref></sup> was like the other rods. There was no difference between them.<sup><xref rid="fn1166">33</xref></sup> This interpretation appears correct to me.</p>
<p>[ONE FOR EACH FATHER&#x2019;S HOUSE.] Each father&#x2019;s house means each tribe. Reuben and Simeon are examples.<sup><xref rid="fn1167">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. [FOR THERE SHALL BE ONE ROD.] Scripture tells us that there shall be one rod for the tribe of Levi because this tribe was divided into <italic>kohanim</italic> and Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn1168">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. WHERE I MEET WITH YOU. Permanently.<sup><xref rid="fn1169">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. I WILL MAKE TO CEASE. The word <italic>ve-hashikkoti</italic> (I will make to cease) comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn1170">37</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>ve-hatimmoti</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1171">38</xref></sup> (and I will consume) in <italic>and I will consume thy filthiness from out of thee</italic> (Ezek. 22:15). It is related to the word <italic>shakhakhah</italic> (assuaged) in <italic>then was the king&#x2019;s wrath assuaged</italic> (Esth. 7:10).</p>
<p><italic>Ve-hashikkoti</italic> (I will make to cease) means I [God] will find rest.<sup><xref rid="fn1172">39</xref></sup> Scripture employs human language.<sup><xref rid="fn1173">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rod of Levi was among the twelve. Behold, the tribe of Joseph was represented by one rod.<sup><xref rid="fn1174">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. FOR THE HOUSE OF LEVI. The word <italic>matteh</italic> (rod of) is to be read as if written twice. Our verse<sup><xref rid="fn1175">42</xref></sup> is to be read as if written: the rod of Aaron, the rod of the house of Levi.</p>
<p>AND BORE RIPE ALMONDS. The word <italic>va-yigmol</italic> (and bore ripe) is related to the word <italic>va-yigammal</italic> (and was weaned) in <italic>And the child grew, and was weaned</italic> (Gen. 21:8).</p>
<p>Many say that the rod<sup><xref rid="fn1176">43</xref></sup> came from an almond tree because the rod bore almonds. However, this is not proof.</p>
<p>The word <italic>shekedim</italic> (almonds) has midrashically been related to the word <italic>shoked</italic> (watch) in I <italic>watch over My word to perform it</italic> (Jer. 1:12).<sup><xref rid="fn1177">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND THEY LOOKED. At the handwriting of each one.</p>
<p>27. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING. It is enough for us that we perished and were undone.<sup><xref rid="fn1178">45</xref></sup> Now, in addition, everyone that comes near the tabernacle will die like those who were burnt. O that we should cease dying.<sup><xref rid="fn1179">46</xref></sup> God then spoke to Aaron, who was the leader of the tribe of Levi, and cautioned him that the Levites not cause the Israelites to stumble.<sup><xref rid="fn1180">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>unto Aaron</italic> (Num. 18:1) is that God communicated with Aaron through Moses. On the other hand, the clause may be taken at face value,<sup><xref rid="fn1181">48</xref></sup> because Aaron too was a prophet.</p>
<p>Also, this section<sup><xref rid="fn1182">49</xref></sup> is proof that the rebellion took place in the desert of Sinai when the tabernacle was erected and the Levites were chosen, and the first-born were disqualified.<sup><xref rid="fn1183">50</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1134"><sup>1</sup> <italic>The fire-pans</italic> in verse 2 refers to the fire-pans of <italic>these men who have sinned</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1135"><sup>2</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ve-asu otam</italic> (literally, and they shall make them).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1136"><sup>3</sup> In other words, and they shall make them means and the workers shall make them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1137"><sup>4</sup> In other words, the word <italic>reku&#x2019;e</italic> (beaten) in our verse is similar in meaning to <italic>va-yerakke&#x2019;u</italic> (and they did beat).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1138"><sup>5</sup> Our verse literally reads, because they were offered before the Lord <italic>and</italic> they are become holy. I.E. believes this should be interpreted as if written, for they are become holy <italic>because</italic> they were offered before the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1139"><sup>6</sup> See Rashi, &#x201C;For a memorial, that people will always say: These plates were from those who disputed the priesthood and were burnt.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1140"><sup>7</sup> The subject is omitted. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. See I.E. on verse 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1141"><sup>8</sup> See <italic>San</italic>. 110a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1142"><sup>9</sup> In other words, it always refers to the next morrow. I.E. comments thus, for the word <italic>machar</italic> (morrow) can refer to a morrow in the far future.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1143"><sup>10</sup> The fact that the 250 men who offered the incense were burned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1144"><sup>11</sup> High priest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1145"><sup>12</sup> You prayed that they be burned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1146"><sup>13</sup> You may have arranged for some combustible material to be mixed with the incense.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1147"><sup>14</sup> Hebrew, <italic>be-hikkahel</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1148"><sup>15</sup> That is, a word from the root <italic>kof, heh, lamed</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1149"><sup>16</sup> As it does in our verse, which reads, <italic>be-hikkahel ha-edah al mosheh ve-al aaron</italic> (when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron). The word <italic>al</italic> usually means on, not against. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1150"><sup>17</sup> I.E. apparently renders <italic>herommu</italic> (Get you up) as, remove yourself from the high place. He cites Num. 16:24, but he actually made his comments on 16:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1151"><sup>18</sup> Hence the word <italic>machtah</italic> (fire-pan) has the definite article <italic>ha</italic> prefixed to it. The literal meaning of <italic>kach et ha-machtah</italic> is, take the fire-pan. According to I.E. <italic>the fire-pan</italic> in our verse means the specific fire-pan used to offer incense (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1152"><sup>19</sup> &#x201C;The&#x201D; incense would refer to the incense usually burned in the tabernacle. Since the definite article is not prefaced to <italic>ketroret</italic> (incense), it refers to another incense.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1153"><sup>20</sup> The difference between the two types of incense. Some of the commentators on I.E. believe that he was of the opinion that the incense used by Moses to stop the plague had the power to clean the air of pollutants that caused the plague (Krinsky, Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1154"><sup>21</sup> In the <italic>hifil. Holekh</italic> looks like a <italic>kal</italic> participle. In this case the word would mean goes or walks. However, the context negates such a rendering. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1155"><sup>22</sup> A <italic>hifil</italic> imperative.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1156"><sup>23</sup> Its root is <italic>yod, lamed, kaf</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1157"><sup>24</sup> <italic>Ve-holekh meherah el ha-edah</italic> means: and bring (and carry) the fire-pan quickly to the congregation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1158"><sup>25</sup> The incense-bearing fire-pan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1159"><sup>26</sup> Verse 15 is connected to verse 16.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1163"><sup>30</sup> According to this view the rod of the Lord (the rod employed by Moses to perform miracles in Egypt) was made of different material from that of the other rods.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1164"><sup>31</sup> If the rod of the tribe of Levi was God&#x2019;s rod.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1165"><sup>32</sup> God&#x2019;s rod.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1166"><sup>33</sup> According to this view the rod of God was the rod of the tribe of Levi. In this opinion God&#x2019;s rod was made of the same material as all the other rods. Hence it was necessary to write Aaron&#x2019;s name on it (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1167"><sup>34</sup> Of tribes and fathers&#x2019; houses.</ftnote>

</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 18</title>
<p>1. THE INIQUITY OF THE SANCTUARY. Which is on the inside of the veil.<sup><xref rid="fn1184">1</xref></sup> Its meaning is, if you do not guard the sanctuary the sin is upon you.</p>
<p>[AND THY FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSE.] For they carried the sanctuary.<sup><xref rid="fn1185">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE INIQUITY OF YOUR PRIESTHOOD. If you do not keep the laws of the priesthood, the sin is upon you.</p>
<p>2. THE TRIBE OF THY FATHER. The reference is to Levi.<sup><xref rid="fn1186">3</xref></sup> Our sages say that <italic>the tribe of thy father</italic> is to be taken at face value.<sup><xref rid="fn1187">4</xref></sup> However, I believe that it is to be explained in keeping with my earlier interpretation. Our verse is to be read as if written, the tribe of Levi which is the tribe of your father.<sup><xref rid="fn1188">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT THEY MAY BE JOINED. The meaning of <italic>ve-yillavu</italic> is similar to <italic>ve-nispechu</italic> (and they shall join) (Is. 14:1). So too the word <italic>yillaveh</italic> (be joined) in <italic>Now this time will my husband be joined</italic> (Gen. 29:34). Look, the Levites are joined by their names.<sup><xref rid="fn1189">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU AND THY SONS WITH THEE. You and your sons, and not the Levites, shall abide before the tent of meeting.</p>
<p>3. NEITHER THEY, NOR YE.<sup><xref rid="fn1190">7</xref></sup> It is the way of Scripture to speak in this manner.<sup><xref rid="fn1191">8</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Rule thou over us, also you, also thy son</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1192">9</xref></sup> (Jud. 8:22). That means this one is like this one.<sup><xref rid="fn1193">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>[4. AND THEY SHALL BE JOINED UNTO THEE.] So that you do not need the services of a stranger, namely, an Israelite.</p>
<p>7. AS A SERVICE OF GIFT. And someone who is a common man in regard to the priesthood even if he be a Levite [shall be put to death]. The burnt offering of Samuel, who was a Levi, is no argument<sup><xref rid="fn1194">11</xref></sup> for it was a temporary ruling, as was the case of Gideon.<sup><xref rid="fn1195">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. FOR A CONSECRATED PORTION.<sup><xref rid="fn1196">13</xref></sup> I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn1197">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. OF THE MOST HOLY THINGS. For there are offerings that have a lesser degree of sacredness.<sup><xref rid="fn1198">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>RESERVED FROM THE FIRE.<sup><xref rid="fn1199">16</xref></sup> Of all that they sanctify,<sup><xref rid="fn1200">17</xref></sup> for <italic>isheh</italic> (fire-offering)<sup><xref rid="fn1201">18</xref></sup> and <italic>esh</italic> (fire) mean the same,<sup><xref rid="fn1202">19</xref></sup> the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>isheh</italic> being superfluous.</p>
<p>AND EVERY MEAL-OFFERING OF THEIRS. After they sanctify the memorial part thereof.<sup><xref rid="fn1203">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND EVERY SIN-OFFERING OF THEIRS, AND EVERY GUILT-OFFERING OF THEIRS.] After they offer the designated organs of the sin offering and the guilt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1204">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHICH THEY MAY RENDER<sup><xref rid="fn1205">22</xref></sup> UNTO ME. The reference is to a trespass.<sup><xref rid="fn1206">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the meal offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering are holier than the peace offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn1207">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. IN A MOST HOLY PLACE SHALT THOU EAT THEREOF. Even in a most holy place, namely, in the tent of meeting shalt thou eat thereof. The tent of meeting is called a most holy place in contrast to the courtyard of the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn1208">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THEIR GIFT. A <italic>tav</italic> is missing in the word <italic>mattanam</italic> (their gift).<sup><xref rid="fn1209">26</xref></sup> <italic>Mattanam</italic> is similar to the word <italic>pinnah</italic> (corner), which has the meaning of <italic>pinnatah</italic> (her corner) in <italic>Passing</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1210">27</xref></sup> <italic>through the street near her corner</italic> (Prov. 7:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1211">28</xref></sup> On the other hand, we may be dealing with two forms.<sup><xref rid="fn1212">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. ALL THE BEST OF THE OIL. <italic>Chelev</italic> (the best) means the most precious, the best. The reference is to the cream of the oil,<sup><xref rid="fn1213">30</xref></sup> for the word <italic>yitzhar</italic> (oil) means light.<sup><xref rid="fn1214">31</xref></sup> Its root is <italic>tzadi, heh, resh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1215">32</xref></sup> The reference is to the fat of the olive oil.</p>
<p>13. THE FIRST-RIPE FRUITS OF ALL THAT IS IN THEIR LAND.<sup><xref rid="fn1216">33</xref></sup> The first of all the fruits of the ground.</p>
<p>[EVERY ONE THAT IS CLEAN IN THY HOUSE MAY EAT THEREOF.] This verse warns that only the clean in your house may eat of fat things<sup><xref rid="fn1217">34</xref></sup> and of the breast of waving<sup><xref rid="fn1218">35</xref></sup> and the thigh of heaving<sup><xref rid="fn1219">36</xref></sup> and also everything dedicated<sup><xref rid="fn1220">37</xref></sup> by an Israelite. The Israelite shall not eat of the latter, for it belongs to God. You [the <italic>kohen</italic>] may eat of it.</p>
<p>15. SHALT THOU SURELY REDEEM. You shall accept the redemption money of the first-born. You shall similarly accept the redemption of the first-born of the unclean beast.<sup><xref rid="fn1221">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THEIR REDEMPTION-MONEY. This only refers to the first-born of humans.<sup><xref rid="fn1222">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THOU SHALT NOT REDEEM. For <italic>they are holy</italic>. You shall not accept their redemption money.</p>
<p>Many say that the word redeem<sup><xref rid="fn1223">40</xref></sup> refers to the Israelites. However,<sup><xref rid="fn1224">41</xref></sup> the reverse is true for the word <italic>tokhelunu</italic> (thou shalt eat it) (Deut. 15:20), in which the prefix thou refers to the <italic>kohen</italic>, for <italic>Thou shalt eat it</italic> refers to the one who is obligated to eat it.</p>
<p>19. COVENANT OF SALT. A &#x201C;cut covenant.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1225">42</xref></sup> The word <italic>melach</italic> (salt) is related to the word <italic>melechah</italic> (salt)<sup><xref rid="fn1226">43</xref></sup> in <italic>A fruitful land turned into salt</italic> (Ps. 107:34). A salted place is said to be cut off, for nothing grows there. Compare, <italic>brimstone, and salt</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1227">44</xref></sup> (Deut. 29:22).</p>
<p>21. IN RETURN. The word <italic>chelef</italic> means in return.</p>
<p>22. AND HENCEFORTH&#x2026;SHALL NOT COME NIGH. This<sup><xref rid="fn1228">45</xref></sup> was written because of Korah&#x2019;s assembly.</p>
<p>23. BUT THE LEVITES ALONE SHALL DO THE SERVICE.<sup><xref rid="fn1229">46</xref></sup> The word <italic>hu</italic> means himself. Others say that <italic>hu</italic> is the object.<sup><xref rid="fn1230">47</xref></sup> However, this is incorrect, for the service of the tent of meeting is the object.<sup><xref rid="fn1231">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY SHALL BEAR THEIR INIQUITY. If they do not keep the charge. Now, the tithe is their inheritance. I therefore stated: [<italic>and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance</italic>].</p>
<p>25. AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING. To Moses, not to Aaron, for Scripture goes on to say that the Levites are to give a tithe to Aaron from the tithe [they received].<sup><xref rid="fn1232">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND AS THE FULNESS. I have already explained the meaning of the word <italic>mele&#x2019;ah</italic> (fullness).<sup><xref rid="fn1233">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. OF ALL THE BEST THEREOF.<sup><xref rid="fn1234">51</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>mi-kol chelbo</italic> is, of all the best thereof. <italic>And ye shall eat the fat</italic> (chelev) <italic>of the land</italic> (Gen. 45:18) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1235">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVEN THE HALLOWED PART THEREOF. For the tenth part thereof is the holy part.<sup><xref rid="fn1236">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>[30. WHEN YE SET APART THE BEST THEREOF.] This has already been mentioned by Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1237">54</xref></sup> It is repeated in order to connect it to that which follows. Its meaning is, you<sup><xref rid="fn1238">55</xref></sup> are prohibited to eat of it<sup><xref rid="fn1239">56</xref></sup> until you set apart the best thereof,<sup><xref rid="fn1240">57</xref></sup> and afterwards it<sup><xref rid="fn1241">58</xref></sup> shall be counted [as the grain of the threshing floor] and you<sup><xref rid="fn1242">59</xref></sup> may eat it in every clean place.<sup><xref rid="fn1243">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. AND YE SHALL BEAR NO SIN BY REASON OF IT. This means when you set apart the best of it<sup><xref rid="fn1244">61</xref></sup> you shall bear no sin through it.<sup><xref rid="fn1245">62</xref></sup> Furthermore, when you give the hallowed part thereof,<sup><xref rid="fn1246">63</xref></sup> the sacred donations of the children of Israel will be preserved.<sup><xref rid="fn1247">64</xref></sup> However, if you do not offer to tithe, then you will bear a sin, for you will have trespassed the commandment and profaned the holy things of the children of Israel because you ate its holy part.</p>

<title>CHAPTER 19</title>
<h1>CHUKKAT</h1>
<p>2. THIS IS THE STATUTE. This chapter was also<sup><xref rid="fn1248">1</xref></sup> stated at Sinai. It was given when God commanded <italic>that they put out of the camp&#x2026;whosoever is unclean by the dead</italic> (Num. 5:2). There were also people who were unclean by coming into contact with a dead body when Passover<sup><xref rid="fn1249">2</xref></sup> arrived (Num. 9:6). This chapter is placed here<sup><xref rid="fn1250">3</xref></sup> because it relates to the <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1251">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A RED HEIFER, FAULTLESS. The heifer is not to be small.<sup><xref rid="fn1252">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn1253">6</xref></sup> says that <italic>the water of sprinkling</italic> (v. 13)<sup><xref rid="fn1254">7</xref></sup> is similar to honey, which is injurious to the one who has red bile<sup><xref rid="fn1255">8</xref></sup> but stimulates the one who has phlegm.<sup><xref rid="fn1256">9</xref></sup> However, there is no need for this interpretation.</p>
<p>3. AND SHE SHALL BE BROUGHT FORTH. Someone shall bring her forth.<sup><xref rid="fn1257">10</xref></sup> Or it means he shall have her brought forth by his command.<sup><xref rid="fn1258">11</xref></sup> The same applies to <italic>ve-shachat</italic> (and she shall be slain),<sup><xref rid="fn1259">12</xref></sup> for Eleazar did not slaughter the heifer. The word <italic>le-fanav</italic> (before his face) proves the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn1260">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THE HEIFER SHALL BE BURNT IN HIS SIGHT. <italic>Ve-saraf et ha-parah</italic> (and the heifer shall be burnt)<sup><xref rid="fn1261">14</xref></sup> is to be rendered, and someone shall burn the heifer. The term <italic>le&#x2019;enav</italic> (in his sight)<sup><xref rid="fn1262">15</xref></sup> proves the latter interpretation.</p>
<p>6. CEDAR-WOOD. As in the case of a leper.<sup><xref rid="fn1263">16</xref></sup> I have hinted there at some secret.<sup><xref rid="fn1264">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THEN THE PRIEST SHALL WASH HIS CLOTHES. The <italic>kohen</italic> who burns it.<sup><xref rid="fn1265">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE PRIEST SHALL BE UNCLEAN. The meaning of <italic>ve-tame ha-kohen</italic> (and the priest shall be unclean) is, and the <italic>kohen</italic> has already been unclean,<sup><xref rid="fn1266">19</xref></sup> or, as some say, the <italic>kohen</italic> shall be unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn1267">20</xref></sup> <italic>Until the even</italic> refers to the eating of sacred food.</p>
<p>9. A MAN THAT IS CLEAN. The reference is not to the <italic>kohen</italic> who burns the cow.<sup><xref rid="fn1268">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>A WATER OF SPRINKLING. The meaning of <italic>niddah</italic> (sprinkling) is distance.<sup><xref rid="fn1269">22</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>me-naddekhem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1270">23</xref></sup> (that hate you) (Is. 66:5).</p>
<p>10. AND BE UNCLEAN UNTIL THE EVEN. Once Scripture states that the gatherer of the ashes shall wash his clothes there is no need to mention that he shall wash in water.<sup><xref rid="fn1271">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND UNTO THE STRANGER THAT SOJOURNETH AMONG THEM. For the Land of Israel is holy because God&#x2019;s glory is there.<sup><xref rid="fn1272">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. EVEN ANY MAN&#x2019;S DEAD BODY. Be it the body of a Jew or a non-Jew.</p>
<p>MAN&#x2019;S&#x2026;BODY. Not the body of an animal.</p>
<p>SHALL BE UNCLEAN. The meaning of <italic>ve-tame</italic> is, shall be unclean. It is a future form, for the <italic>vav</italic> changes the verb<sup><xref rid="fn1273">26</xref></sup> from a perfect to an imperfect. However, I believe that <italic>ve-tame</italic> is in the past tense.<sup><xref rid="fn1274">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THE SAME SHALL PURIFY HIMSELF THEREWITH. The meaning of <italic>hu yitchate vo</italic> (the same shall purify himself therewith) is, he shall remove his sin therewith.<sup><xref rid="fn1275">28</xref></sup> On the other hand, the word <italic>yitchate</italic> (shall purify himself) is similar to the word <italic>techatteni</italic> (purge me) in <italic>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean</italic> (Ps. 51:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1276">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those who are acquainted with the secret of numbers know that the number three is like the number seven.<sup><xref rid="fn1277">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. BECAUSE THE WATER OF SPRINKLING. Some say that that <italic>me niddah</italic> (the water of sprinkling) has the same meaning as <italic>me niddah</italic> (water of sprinkling) in <italic>it shall be purified with the water of sprinkling</italic> (Num. 31:23).<sup><xref rid="fn1278">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>WAS NOT DASHED. The word <italic>zorak</italic> (dashed) refers to the water.<sup><xref rid="fn1279">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>IS YET. The word <italic>od</italic> (is yet) means continuously.<sup><xref rid="fn1280">33</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>od</italic> (while) in <italic>While the earth remaineth</italic> (Gen. 8:22).</p>
<p>14. IN A TENT. A house has the same law as a tent. Scripture mentions a tent because Israel then lived in tents. <italic>That killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp</italic> (Lev. 17:3) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1281">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND EVERY THING THAT IS IN THE TENT. Garments.<sup><xref rid="fn1282">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. COVERING CLOSE-BOUND. Two coverings.<sup><xref rid="fn1283">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. OR A GRAVE. Of a human being.</p>
<p>17. AND FOR THE UNCLEAN THEY SHALL TAKE. See, Scripture explains how one who comes into contact with the dead shall purge himself.<sup><xref rid="fn1284">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. A CLEAN PERSON. The reference is most probably to a <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1285">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. BUT THE MAN THAT SHALL BE UNCLEAN. Scripture has already mentioned, <italic>Whosoever toucheth the dead&#x2026;that soul shall be cut off from Israel</italic> (v. 13). It now warns the one who touches a bone or a grave [not to defile the sanctuary].</p>
<p>21. SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL EVEN. And shall not become clean until he washes.</p>
<p>22. AND WHATSOEVER THE UNCLEAN PERSON TOUCHETH SHALL BE UNCLEAN. The reference is to one who has become unclean by touching a dead body, a bone, or a grave.</p>
<p>SHALL BE UNCLEAN UNTIL EVEN. And washes.<sup><xref rid="fn1286">39</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1248"><sup>1</sup> Like the incident of Korah. See I.E. on Num 16:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1249"><sup>2</sup> Celebrated by Israel in the second year after the Exodus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1250"><sup>3</sup> Following the laws dealing with the tithes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1251"><sup>4</sup> The <italic>kohen</italic> played a major role in the ritual of the red heifer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1252"><sup>5</sup> For the Bible speaks of a <italic>parah</italic> (cow), not of an <italic>eglah</italic> (heifer).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1253"><sup>6</sup> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1254"><sup>7</sup> Which cleansed the unclean but made the clean unclean.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1255"><sup>8</sup> In medieval medicine red bile was believed to cause a volatile nature. See I.E. on Ex. 23:25 (Vol. 2, p. 516).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1256"><sup>9</sup> An excess of phlegm. This causes a phlegmatic nature.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1257"><sup>10</sup> The literal meaning of <italic>ve-hotzi otah</italic> is: and he shall bring her forth. However, since Eleazar did not actually slaughter the cow, I.E. believes that he did not bring it out. Hence his comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1258"><sup>11</sup> In other words, it means he shall command that it be brought out.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1259"><sup>12</sup> Which literally means: and he shall slaughter it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1260"><sup>13</sup> If Eleazar did the slaughtering, then what point would there be for Scripture to say &#x201C;and he [Eleazar] shall slaughter it before his [Eleazar&#x2019;s] face.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1261"><sup>14</sup> The literal meaning of <italic>ve-saraf et ha-parah</italic> is: and he shall burn the cow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1262"><sup>15</sup> Eleazar&#x2019;s sight.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1263"><sup>16</sup> Cedar wood was used in cleansing a leper (Lev. 14:4).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1264"><sup>17</sup> I.E. points out that there is a connection between leprosy and death. Hence cedar is employed in cleansing someone who has been contaminated by contract with a leper or a dead body.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1265"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Prima facie</italic>, the reference is to the cow. However, in view of the fact that the latter is stated in the next verse, some say that the reference is to the cedar. See Filwarg and Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1266"><sup>19</sup> The <italic>kohen</italic> has been made unclean by performing the ritual. According to this interpretation the <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to <italic>ve-tame</italic> means &#x201C;and.&#x201D; Hence the meaning of <italic>ve-tame ha-kohen</italic> is: and the <italic>kohen</italic> was unclean.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1267"><sup>20</sup> In this case <italic>ve-tame</italic> is a future form meaning: and he shall be unclean. The <italic>vav</italic> is a conversive <italic>vav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1268"><sup>21</sup> Another <italic>kohen</italic> does this (Krinsky). According to the <italic>Sifre</italic> on this verse, any clean person, even if not a <italic>kohen</italic>, may gather the ashes of the red cow. However, I.E. seems to believe that this task was assigned to a <italic>kohen</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1269"><sup>22</sup> The person who is unclean is distanced from the sanctuary. Thus <italic>me-niddah</italic> (water of sprinkling) means the water of the distant, i.e., the water to be used to purify the distant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1270"><sup>23</sup> <italic>Me-naddekhem</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>niddah</italic>. When one hates another person, he keeps his distance from him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1271"><sup>24</sup> For Scripture earlier linked the two. See verse 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1272"><sup>25</sup> Hence even a stranger (a non-Jew) must abide by this rule.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1273"><sup>26</sup> <italic>Tame</italic>, a third person perfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1274"><sup>27</sup> Its <italic>vav</italic> being conjunctive. Thus the meaning of <italic>ve-tame</italic> is: and he was unclean. The import of our verse thus is: and after being unclean for seven days he shall purify himself. See I.E. on verse 7 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1275"><sup>28</sup> That is, by undergoing this ritual he will remove the potentiality of entering the sanctuary in a state of impurity and thus sinning. The word <italic>chet</italic> means sin. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1276"><sup>29</sup> In other words, <italic>yitchatta</italic> means purify.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1277"><sup>30</sup> The number seven has mystical significance in that seven days make up a lunar quarter. The number three is close to half of the number 7. See I.E. on Gen. 34:25 and the notes thereto (Vol. 1, p. 330).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1278"><sup>31</sup> In other words, both refer to water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer. Num. 31:23 deals with the purification of utensils captured from non-Jews. I.E. prefaces these remarks with &#x201C;some say&#x201D; because, according to the rabbis, Num. 31:23 refers to water in which a menstruant immerses herself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1279"><sup>32</sup> Even though <italic>zorak</italic> is singular and <italic>me</italic> (water of) is plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1280"><sup>33</sup> He is continuously unclean until sprinkled.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1281"><sup>34</sup> The law laid down in Lev. 17:3 applies equally to a town. Scripture speaks of a camp because Israel then lived in tents in a camp.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1282"><sup>35</sup> For the next verse deals with vessels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1283"><sup>36</sup> Scripture reads, <italic>tzamid, petil</italic> (close bound). According to I.E. each one of these terms refers to a covering. The <italic>tzamid</italic> goes over the opening, while the petil goes round about the above covering and the rim of the utensil (Krinsky). Others claim that I.E. believes that the cover is made of two parts. See Krinsky, Filwarg, and Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1284"><sup>37</sup> Earlier, in verse 12, Scripture had said, <italic>the same shall purify himself therewith</italic>. However, it did not describe the procedure. Now it does.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1285"><sup>38</sup> For <italic>kohanim</italic> are acquainted with the laws of purification.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 20</title>
<p>1. IN THE FIRST MONTH. In the fortieth year.<sup><xref rid="fn1287">1</xref></sup> Look, the Torah does not contain any act or prophecy except in the first and the fortieth year.<sup><xref rid="fn1288">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, EVEN THE WHOLE CONGREGATION, CAME.] Scripture states this because the generation that left Egypt died in the wilderness and they who were entering Canaan came to the desert of Zin.<sup><xref rid="fn1289">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE PEOPLE ABODE IN KADESH. For they dwelt there for many days.<sup><xref rid="fn1290">4</xref></sup> The latter is clearly stated in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1291">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND THERE WAS NO WATER FOR THE CONGREGATION. Scripture tells of two incidents.<sup><xref rid="fn1292">6</xref></sup> One, the death of Miriam. Two, the death of Aaron and Moses and their failure to enter the land.<sup><xref rid="fn1293">7</xref></sup> It begins by telling the cause of the latter.</p>
<p>3. AND THE PEOPLE STROVE. <italic>Va-yarev</italic> (strove) is a <italic>hifil</italic>.</p>
<p>WHEN OUR BRETHREN PERISHED. <italic>Bi-geva</italic> (when&#x2026;perished) is an infinitive. It is similar to <italic>ki-shekav</italic> (when&#x2026;shall sleep) in <italic>when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers</italic> (I Kings 1:21).</p>
<p>OUR BRETHREN. The generation that died in the desert. They were servants of the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn1294">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND WHY HAVE YE BROUGHT. This was addressed to Moses and Aaron, for Scripture goes on to say, <italic>and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron</italic> (v. 2). Scripture reads, <italic>And the people strove with Moses</italic>, (v. 3) because their quarrel with Moses was more intense.<sup><xref rid="fn1295">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. HAVE YE MADE US TO COME UP. <italic>He&#x2019;elitunu</italic> (have ye made us to come up) is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn1296">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND MOSES AND AARON WENT<sup><xref rid="fn1297">11</xref></sup> FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE ASSEMBLY. Like those who flee.<sup><xref rid="fn1298">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND FELL UPON THEIR FACES. To pray. Other interpret, to prophetically inquire of God.</p>
<p>8. TAKE THE ROD. Many interpretations are offered for this incident.<sup><xref rid="fn1299">13</xref></sup> There is an individual opinion that Moses sinned because he said to Israel, who are the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: <italic>Hear now, ye rebels</italic> (v. 10). However, if this were the case why did he again say,<sup><xref rid="fn1300">14</xref></sup> <italic>ye have been rebellious against the Lord</italic> (Deut. 9:7).</p>
<p>Others say that the word <italic>ve-dibbartem</italic> (and speak ye) has the meaning, and ye shall strike. It is similar to the word <italic>va-tedabber</italic> (and destroyed) in <italic>and destroyed all the seed royal</italic> (II Chron. 22:10). However, this is incorrect, for <italic>va-tedabber</italic> is related to the word <italic>dever</italic> (destruction) or to the word <italic>yadber</italic> (he subdueth) in <italic>He subdueth peoples under us</italic> (Ps. 47:4). <italic>Va-tedabber</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1301">15</xref></sup> thus means, and destroyed. Indeed, it so reads in the other book.<sup><xref rid="fn1302">16</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ve-dibbartem el ha-sela</italic> (and speak ye unto the rock) thus is,<sup><xref rid="fn1303">17</xref></sup> and ye shall destroy the rock.<sup><xref rid="fn1304">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, if this is the meaning of the word,<sup><xref rid="fn1305">19</xref></sup> why was Moses punished? The above commentaries answer, because he hit the rock twice. However, if this is the case why was Aaron punished?<sup><xref rid="fn1306">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen the Spaniard, of blessed memory, says that some signs<sup><xref rid="fn1307">21</xref></sup> are performed by word of mouth, others by action and speech, as in the case of the salt<sup><xref rid="fn1308">22</xref></sup> which Elisha cast into the water.<sup><xref rid="fn1309">23</xref></sup> God commanded Moses to take the staff and strike the rock as he did in the case of the rock [at Horeb].<sup><xref rid="fn1310">24</xref></sup> He added the word <italic>ve-dibbartem</italic> (and speak ye)<sup><xref rid="fn1311">25</xref></sup> so that the water would flow via the speech and the blow. Because Israel angered him, Moses said, are we to bring you forth water from the rock? What Moses meant<sup><xref rid="fn1312">26</xref></sup> was, we do not have the power to bring water out of the rock. We can only do so by the power of God. Now Moses did not make himself clear. People thought what he said was that God cannot bring water out of the rock. This is the meaning of <italic>because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel</italic> (Deut. 32:51). Rabbi Moses offered proof from the words of the poet who said, <italic>For they embittered his spirit, And he spoke rashly with his lip</italic> (Ps. 106:33). The sin was thus in his expressing, not by striking [the rock].</p>
<p>However, this too is incorrect, for Moses said, <italic>are we to bring you forth water out of this rock</italic> (v. 10). Why was Aaron punished?<sup><xref rid="fn1313">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, no speech is mentioned in the Torah&#x2019;s description of the act of striking the rock.<sup><xref rid="fn1314">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The proof offered<sup><xref rid="fn1315">29</xref></sup> by Rabbi Moses is no proof because the meaning of <italic>For they embittered his spirit</italic> is that they embittered God&#x2019;s spirit. Scripture similarly writes, <italic>But they rebelled, and grieved His holy spirit</italic> (Is. 63:10). This is the meaning of <italic>They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah</italic> (Ps. 106:32). It means they angered God.<sup><xref rid="fn1316">30</xref></sup> Scripture similarly states, <italic>These are the waters of Meribah, where the children of Israel strove with the Lord</italic> (Num. 20:13).<sup><xref rid="fn1317">31</xref></sup> Scripture says, <italic>And it went ill with Moses because of them</italic> (Ps. 106:32) because they embittered God&#x2019;s spirit, and He decreed that Moses not enter the land.<sup><xref rid="fn1318">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that the meaning of speak to the rock can only mean strike the rock, for a rock cannot hear.<sup><xref rid="fn1319">33</xref></sup> Now if this is so, why was Moses punished?<sup><xref rid="fn1320">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that Moses and Aaron were punished because they did not sing a song of praise<sup><xref rid="fn1321">35</xref></sup> as in <italic>Spring up, O well-sing ye unto it</italic> (Num. 21:17). They say that this is the meaning of <italic>because ye sanctified Me not</italic> (Deut. 32:51).<sup><xref rid="fn1322">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that God commanded Moses and Aaron to speak to the rock, but they did not speak to it. On the contrary, Moses struck the rock.<sup><xref rid="fn1323">37</xref></sup> Therefore they were both punished and they were told, <italic>ye trespassed</italic> (Deut. 32:51); <italic>ye rebelled</italic> (v. 24); <italic>ye believed not in Me</italic> (v. 12), and <italic>ye sanctified Me not</italic> (Deut. 32:52).</p>
<p>Those who are guided by reason<sup><xref rid="fn1324">38</xref></sup> say that it is impossible that a messenger of God would alter God&#x2019;s word.<sup><xref rid="fn1325">39</xref></sup> If Moses transformed God&#x2019;s word, how can we believe his Torah?<sup><xref rid="fn1326">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the aforementioned<sup><xref rid="fn1327">41</xref></sup> also spoke incorrectly, for if Moses had altered a commandment he would have been punished immediately.<sup><xref rid="fn1328">42</xref></sup> Look, Moses was punished with regard to something which was not an eternal commandment and not a law given to Israel. Nor did he knowingly violate God&#x2019;s command. He only did so inadvertently because Israel angered him. Moses clearly said, <italic>Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes</italic> (Deut. 1:<italic>37)</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1329">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that Israel told Moses<sup><xref rid="fn1330">44</xref></sup> to bring water out of a different rock.<sup><xref rid="fn1331">45</xref></sup> They offer <italic>this rock</italic> as proof (v. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn1332">46</xref></sup> However, Moses was afraid to alter God&#x2019;s word.<sup><xref rid="fn1333">47</xref></sup> Moses was punished because he did not believe that he would be able to bring forth water from the rock that Israel chose. He was therefore punished.<sup><xref rid="fn1334">48</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>ye believed not in Me</italic> (v. 12). This interpretation is also incorrect, for Scripture states, <italic>ye rebelled against My word</italic> (v. 24). However, they did not rebel.<sup><xref rid="fn1335">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will reveal in hints the explanation which appears correct to me. Know, when the part<sup><xref rid="fn1336">50</xref></sup> knows the All,<sup><xref rid="fn1337">51</xref></sup> he cleaves to the All and creates signs and wonders with the help of the All.<sup><xref rid="fn1338">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now it is true that God told Moses and Aaron, <italic>speak ye unto the rock</italic>. They did not speak to the rock because the people were quarreling with Moses. The &#x201C;part&#x201D; thus remained a &#x201C;part.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1339">53</xref></sup> He struck the rock, and water did not come out of it<sup><xref rid="fn1340">54</xref></sup> until he struck it a second time.<sup><xref rid="fn1341">55</xref></sup> Moses and Aaron thus did not sanctify God&#x2019;s name. They inadvertently rebelled and trespassed.</p>
<p>It is also possible to explain that <italic>And he spoke rashly with his lips</italic> (Ps. 106:33) refers to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1342">56</xref></sup> It was unseemly for Moses to say anything<sup><xref rid="fn1343">57</xref></sup> before fulfilling God&#x2019;s command. Moses was therefore punished.</p>
<p>The midrashic interpretation of our ancients, of blessed memory, who said that Moses sinned because he said, <italic>Hear now, ye rebels</italic> (v. 10) is also in keeping with this interpretation. The rabbis hint at this secret.</p>
<p>UNTO THE ROCK. Which I pointed out to you or which is found close to the camp.<sup><xref rid="fn1344">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT IT GIVE FORTH ITS WATER. Many erred and said that the rock is to be identified with the stone [at Horeb]<sup><xref rid="fn1345">59</xref></sup> because Scripture reads, <italic>its</italic> water.<sup><xref rid="fn1346">60</xref></sup> However, they cannot think straight. The stone was in Horeb and this rock was at the border of the land of Edom, for it was in Kadesh.<sup><xref rid="fn1347">61</xref></sup> It is also possible to interpret <italic>its water</italic> as meaning, the water which I will place in it.</p>
<p>9. THE ROD FROM BEFORE THE LORD. The reference is to the rod of God.<sup><xref rid="fn1348">62</xref></sup> It was the rod which was placed before the testimony.<sup><xref rid="fn1349">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. ARE WE TO BRING YOU FORTH WATER OUT OF THIS ROCK? Do we have the power to bring forth water out of this rock for you?</p>
<p>12. BECAUSE YE BELIEVED NOT IN ME. This alludes to the secret at which I hinted, i.e., that God&#x2019;s name was not sanctified through them.</p>
<p>13. AND HE WAS SANCTIFIED IN THEM. Through Moses and Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn1350">64</xref></sup> Our verse has the same meaning as <italic>Through them that are nigh unto Me I will be sanctified</italic> (Lev. 10:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1351">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. FROM KADESH. Kadesh is the name of a place where a city is located. It is not to be identified with Kadesh-barnea,<sup><xref rid="fn1352">66</xref></sup> for the latter was a wilderness.<sup><xref rid="fn1353">67</xref></sup> Thus Scripture reads, <italic>The Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh</italic> (Ps. 29:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1354">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE TRAVAIL. I have already explained the meaning of the word <italic>tela&#x2019;ah</italic> (travail).<sup><xref rid="fn1355">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. EGYPTIANS DEALT ILL WITH US, AND OUR FATHERS. Who died. The meaning of our clause is that their evil<sup><xref rid="fn1356">70</xref></sup> lasted a very long time.</p>
<p>[16.] AND SENT AN ANGEL.<sup><xref rid="fn1357">71</xref></sup> This is to be taken literally. Scripture similarly states, <italic>And the angel of His presence saved them</italic> (Is. 63:9). Many said that the reference is to Moses<sup><xref rid="fn1358">72</xref></sup> for they found <italic>Then spoke Haggai the Lord&#x2019;s messenger</italic> (malakh)<sup><xref rid="fn1359">73</xref></sup> (Haggai 1:13). However, this is not my opinion.</p>
<p>17. THROUGH FIELD OR THROUGH VINEYARD. So that they do not destroy it. We will not even drink the water of your wells.</p>
<p>WE WILL GO ALONG THE KING&#x2019;S HIGHWAY. The major highway upon which the king travels. Or its meaning is, the road that the king, namely, the king of Edom, will command us to travel in.<sup><xref rid="fn1360">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. WE WILL GO UP BY THE HIGHWAY. What harm will it cause you if we up by the highway? If we need water you will sell it to us. This is the meaning of <italic>mikhram</italic> (v. 19). It means the price thereof.</p>
<p>22. [THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] Its meaning is, <italic>the entire congregation</italic>. Because Edom went to fight against them, Scripture relates that no one was missing from the children of Israel when they came from the city of Edom to Mount Hor.<sup><xref rid="fn1361">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AARON SHALL BE GATHERED UNTO HIS PEOPLE. This is similar to <italic>and die in the mount</italic> (Deut. 32:50).<sup><xref rid="fn1362">76</xref></sup> It means that Aaron should prepare himself to die, and go up the mountain.<sup><xref rid="fn1363">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>YE HAVE REBELLED. I have explained this.</p>
<p>AT THE WATERS OF MERIBAH. <italic>Le-me merivah</italic> means at the waters of Meribah.<sup><xref rid="fn1364">78</xref></sup> It is the name of a place. Or <italic>le-me merivah</italic> means because of the waters of Meribah.<sup><xref rid="fn1365">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. AND STRIP&#x2026;AND PUT THEM UPON. <italic>Ve-hafshet</italic> (and strip) and <italic>ve-hilbashtam</italic> (and put them upon) are <italic>hifils</italic>.</p>
<p>[AND AARON SHALL BE GATHERED.] Its meaning is, as soon as you strip Aaron of his garments, he shall die.</p>
<p>AND AARON WAS GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE.<sup><xref rid="fn1366">80</xref></sup> I have explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn1367">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND WHEN ALL THE CONGREGATION SAW. When they saw the event which occurred, they wept for thirty days.<sup><xref rid="fn1368">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>[DIED.] I have already explained the meaning of the term.<sup><xref rid="fn1369">83</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1287"><sup>1</sup> Following the Exodus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1288"><sup>2</sup> Scripture describes what happened in the first and the last year of Israel&#x2019;s sojourn in the wilderness. What happened in the other years is ignored. Actually the Book of Numbers opens with a command to Moses in the second month of the second year. Filwarg explains that I.E. was not being precise. Some editions read, &#x201C;except for the first year, the fortieth year.&#x201D; The latter is to be interpreted as if written, and the fortieth year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1289"><sup>3</sup> The phrase <italic>even the whole congregation</italic> appears to be unnecessary. I.E. says that it refers to those about to enter Canaan. They are now the complete congregation, for none of them need die in the wilderness. Rashi comments similarly.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 21</title>
<p>1. AND THE CANAANITE, THE KING OF ARAD. The ancients<sup><xref rid="fn1370">1</xref></sup> said he<sup><xref rid="fn1371">2</xref></sup> is Sihon. He is called a Canaanite, for all Amorites are Canaanites.<sup><xref rid="fn1372">3</xref></sup> Many say that Joshua wrote this section.<sup><xref rid="fn1373">4</xref></sup> <italic>The king of Arad, one</italic> (Josh. 12:14) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1374">5</xref></sup> They also found that Scripture states that the children of Judah called the name of the place Hormah.<sup><xref rid="fn1375">6</xref></sup> However, they are wrong, for that place<sup><xref rid="fn1376">7</xref></sup> was originally called Zephath<sup><xref rid="fn1377">8</xref></sup> while the place spoken of in our verse was ruled by the king of Arad.<sup><xref rid="fn1378">9</xref></sup> In reality they are two places.<sup><xref rid="fn1379">10</xref></sup> There are many such instances in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1380">11</xref></sup> According to the plain meaning of the text the king of Arad ruled over the eastern bank of the Jordan.<sup><xref rid="fn1381">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>This portion<sup><xref rid="fn1382">13</xref></sup> was connected to the death of Aaron, because Scripture relates what happened on Mount Hor<sup><xref rid="fn1383">14</xref></sup> before they [Israel] journeyed from there. <italic>And the Canaanite, the king of Arad&#x2026; heard&#x2026;and they journeyed from mount Hor</italic> (v. 4) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1384">15</xref></sup> If you want to find what the king of Arad heard, observe, it is clearly stated.<sup><xref rid="fn1385">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT ISRAEL CAME BY THE WAY OF ATHARIM. Some say that the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>atharim</italic> is superfluous. They say that the meaning of <italic>ha-atharim</italic> is, those who spy. The <italic>alef of ezro&#x2019;akha</italic> (your arm) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1386">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. TO COMPASS THE LAND OF EDOM. Zalmonah and Punon, for this is explicitly stated in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1387">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. THIS LIGHT BREAD. The word <italic>ha-kelokel</italic> (this light) means the very light. The word is formed by doubling the word <italic>kal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1388">19</xref></sup> There are many similar instances in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1389">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND THE LORD&#x2026;SERPENTS. The word <italic>ha-serafim</italic> (fiery) is an adjective. The following is a midrashic interpretation. Scripture states, <italic>If the serpent bite before it is charmed, Then the charmer hath no advantage</italic> (Eccles. 10:11). These people<sup><xref rid="fn1390">21</xref></sup> sent their tongues to bite.<sup><xref rid="fn1391">22</xref></sup> They were repaid with snakes being sent against them.</p>
<p>8. MAKE THEE. A form of a fiery serpent <italic>out of brass</italic>, for Scripture explicitly says so.<sup><xref rid="fn1392">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SET IT UPON A POLE. So that it be on a high place and everyone will be able to see it.</p>
<p>Many err. They say that this was an image that had the capability of receiving powers from on high.<sup><xref rid="fn1393">24</xref></sup> Far be it, far be it [for one to believe such a thing], for this thing was made by God&#x2019;s command.<sup><xref rid="fn1394">25</xref></sup> We should not investigate why Moses was commanded to make the form of a snake.<sup><xref rid="fn1395">26</xref></sup> Should someone disagree,<sup><xref rid="fn1396">27</xref></sup> let him show us if there is a tree that makes bitter waters sweet.<sup><xref rid="fn1397">28</xref></sup> Even honey will not sweeten them.<sup><xref rid="fn1398">29</xref></sup> What reason was there to put a cake of figs upon a boil?<sup><xref rid="fn1399">30</xref></sup> It is not in the nature of figs to remove boils. The truth is that the mind of the Almighty is beyond us.</p>
<p>10. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED. From the land of Edom, for Scripture states, <italic>to compass the land of Edom</italic> (v. 4). Punon<sup><xref rid="fn1400">31</xref></sup> is on the far border of Edom. The Israelites traveled from Punon to Oboth, for Scripture says so.<sup><xref rid="fn1401">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND PITCHED IN THE VALLEY OF ZERED. Zered is elsewhere referred to as Dibon-gad.<sup><xref rid="fn1402">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. FOR ARNON IS THE BORDER OF MOAB. It was so at first.<sup><xref rid="fn1403">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. IN THE BOOK OF THE WARS OF THE LORD. It was a separate book in which the wars of the Lord on behalf of His servants was recorded. It is possible that it originated in the days of Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn1404">35</xref></sup> for many books, such as the work of Nathan<sup><xref rid="fn1405">36</xref></sup> and Iddo,<sup><xref rid="fn1406">37</xref></sup> the chronicles of the kings of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn1407">38</xref></sup> and the songs of Solomon and his proverbs,<sup><xref rid="fn1408">39</xref></sup> were lost and are not found among us.</p>
<p>VAHEB IN SUPHAH. There were wars in these mentioned places in ancient times.</p>
<p>The word Vaheb is not Hebrew. Neither is Vophsi (Num. 13:14), Vashti (Esth. 1:9), Vaizatha (Esth. 9:9), and also Vashni (I Chron. 6:13). It is possible that the <italic>vav</italic> of Vashni is a connective.<sup><xref rid="fn1409">40</xref></sup> I say all this<sup><xref rid="fn1410">41</xref></sup> because we do not find the <italic>vav</italic> to be a root letter at the beginning of a word<sup><xref rid="fn1411">42</xref></sup> except in the word <italic>vave</italic> (hooks) in <italic>the hooks of the pillars</italic> (Ex. 27:10). It is found<sup><xref rid="fn1412">43</xref></sup> only in place of a <italic>yod</italic>. Compare, <italic>valed</italic> (child) (II Sam. 6:23).<sup><xref rid="fn1413">44</xref></sup> The explanation of the Aramaic translation is known.<sup><xref rid="fn1414">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THE SLOPE OF THE VALLEYS. Some say that the word <italic>eshed</italic> (slope) is Aramaic.<sup><xref rid="fn1415">46</xref></sup> The end of the matter is: all of these<sup><xref rid="fn1416">47</xref></sup> are names of places.<sup><xref rid="fn1417">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT INCLINETH. The reference is to the Israelites,<sup><xref rid="fn1418">49</xref></sup> for they passed by Ar.<sup><xref rid="fn1419">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND LEANETH UPON THE BORDER OF MOAB. This is what <italic>and they</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1420">51</xref></sup> <italic>abide over against me</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1421">52</xref></sup> (Num. 22:5) refers to. Israel journeyed from there<sup><xref rid="fn1422">53</xref></sup> to a place called <italic>be&#x2019;er</italic>, for the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>be&#x2019;erah</italic> (to Beer) is in place of the word <italic>el</italic> (to). It is like the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>mitzraymah</italic> (to Egypt) (Gen. 12 :10).<sup><xref rid="fn1423">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>This well<sup><xref rid="fn1424">55</xref></sup> was also<sup><xref rid="fn1425">56</xref></sup> the result of a miracle. I believe that it is not the well which is called Miriam&#x2019;s well.<sup><xref rid="fn1426">57</xref></sup> On the contrary, it refers to a place that Moses commanded to be dug. The princes of Israel dug it with their staffs, and water immediately gushed forth.</p>
<p>17. SPRING UP, O WELL. This is how the song opened. Scripture does not record the entire song.</p>
<p>SING YE UNTO IT. The word <italic>enu</italic> (sing) is an imperative. Note, Scripture explains<sup><xref rid="fn1427">58</xref></sup> how it came into being.<sup><xref rid="fn1428">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. WHICH THE NOBLES OF THE PEOPLE DELVED. Scripture repeats itself,<sup><xref rid="fn1429">60</xref></sup> as is its style.</p>
<p>WITH THE SCEPTRE. The meaning of <italic>bi-mechokek</italic> (with the sceptre) is, by the governors.<sup><xref rid="fn1430">61</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>My heart is toward the governors</italic> (chokeke) <italic>of Israel</italic> (Jud. 5:9).</p>
<p>This well was in the wilderness, far from an inhabited place. From this wilderness Israel journeyed to Mattanah. From Mattanah they journeyed to Nahaliel.</p>
<p>Note that <italic>eshed ha-nehalim</italic> (the slope of the valleys) and the wilderness which is called Beer and Mattanah and Nahaliel are all names of places. They are also referred to by a general name, <italic>viz.</italic>, <italic>Almon-diblathiam</italic> (Num. 33:46), which is found in the Torah portion <italic>Ve-Elleh Mase</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1431">62</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is also possible that these are the names of places that the Israelites passed over in another journey.<sup><xref rid="fn1432">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mountains of Abarim in front of Nebo (Num. 33:47) are to be identified with Bamoth and the valley that is in the field of Moab (v. 20). The following is proof of this. Scripture states that Israel journeyed from the valley<sup><xref rid="fn1433">64</xref></sup> to the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho (Num. 22:1).<sup><xref rid="fn1434">65</xref></sup> It also states that Israel journeyed from the mountains of Abarim to the plains of Moab beyond the Jordon at Jericho (Num. 33:48). It further states, <italic>So we abode in the valley</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1435">66</xref></sup> <italic>over against Beth-peor</italic> (Deut. 3:29) at the time that I [Moses] pleaded [with God].<sup><xref rid="fn1436">67</xref></sup> Scripture elsewhere states, <italic>Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo</italic> (Deut. 32:49).<sup><xref rid="fn1437">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture also states, <italic>and he was buried in the valley</italic> (Deut. 34:6). The Torah there states, <italic>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo</italic> to the top of Pisgah (Deut. 34:1). The valley was thus at the top of Pisgah. Moses died there, and there was no need to move him after his death.<sup><xref rid="fn1438">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. WHICH LOOKETH DOWN. <italic>Ve-nishkafah</italic> (which looketh down) is in the feminine. It refers to the valley.<sup><xref rid="fn1439">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>UPON THE DESERT. The word <italic>yeshimon</italic> (desert) means a wasteland (<italic>shemamah</italic>). <italic>And in the waste, a howling wilderness</italic> (yeshimon) (Deut. 32:10) is the proof text. So too is <italic>They wandered in the wilderness</italic> (yeshimon) <italic>in a desert way</italic> (Ps. 107:4).</p>
<p>23. TO JAHAZ. <italic>Yahtzah</italic> means to Jahaz.<sup><xref rid="fn1440">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. FROM THE ARNON. Which he [the king of Edom] took from Moab.</p>
<p>EVEN UNTO THE CHILDREN OF AMMON. Scripture records that half of the land of Ammon belonged to the children of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn1441">72</xref></sup> for they<sup><xref rid="fn1442">73</xref></sup> took it from the Amorites who originally took it from the children of Ammon. Now Scripture tells us that God would not give the Israelites even the size of a footstep from any of the land belonging to the Ammonites and Moabites. The reference is to the land which Ammon and Moab possessed at that time.<sup><xref rid="fn1443">74</xref></sup> Scripture therefore had to record the words of the poets.<sup><xref rid="fn1444">75</xref></sup> It did so because Israel lived in Heshbon.<sup><xref rid="fn1445">76</xref></sup> The Torah explicitly states, <italic>And Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorite, in Heshbon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1446">77</xref></sup> (v. 25).</p>
<p>25. AND IN ALL THE TOWNS THEREOF.<sup><xref rid="fn1447">78</xref></sup> Heshbon is like a mother, and the towns are like daughters.<sup><xref rid="fn1448">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. FOR HESHBON WAS THE CITY OF SIHON. It turned into the city of Sihon, for, as was well known, he fought against the former king of Moab.<sup><xref rid="fn1449">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. THEY THAT SPEAK IN PARABLES. Who invent parables on their own.<sup><xref rid="fn1450">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>[COME YE TO HESHBON.] They said this to the Amorites.</p>
<p>BE BUILT. Better than before.</p>
<p>AND ESTABLISHED. To be the city of Sihon.</p>
<p>28. FOR A FIRE IS GONE OUT OF HESHBON. This alludes to the people of Heshbon who conspired against their king.<sup><xref rid="fn1451">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>A FLAME. The idea is repeated in accord with poetic style.<sup><xref rid="fn1452">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM THE CITY OF SIHON. From the city that today belongs to Sihon.</p>
<p>AR OF MOAB. Ar is the name of a place. It is in Moab.<sup><xref rid="fn1453">84</xref></sup> Compare, Beth-lehem Judah<sup><xref rid="fn1454">85</xref></sup> (Ruth 1:1).</p>
<p>THE HIGH PLACES. <italic>Bamot</italic> means the high places.<sup><xref rid="fn1455">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. CHEMOSH. The name of an idol; Moab&#x2019;s god.</p>
<p>FUGITIVES. Those who flee. Fugitives that run from the sword.</p>
<p>30. WE HAVE SHOT THEM. These are the words of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1456">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>va-niram</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1457">88</xref></sup> (we shot at them) refers to the king of the Amorites and his troops. It has two interpretations. One, that <italic>va-niram</italic> is related to the word <italic>nir</italic> (kingship). It<sup><xref rid="fn1458">89</xref></sup> is to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn1459">90</xref></sup> It is like <italic>even the prophecy, Oded the prophet</italic> (II Chron. 15:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1460">91</xref></sup> Our verse means, and their king the king of Heshbon was destroyed. <italic>Va-niram</italic> is similar to the word <italic>ha-oholi</italic> (my tent) in <italic>in the midst of my tent</italic> (Josh. 7:21), and to <italic>ha-erkekha</italic> (thy valuation) (Lev. 27:23).<sup><xref rid="fn1461">92</xref></sup> <italic>Va-niram avad cheshbon</italic> (we have shot at them&#x2014;Heshbon is perished) means, their king, that is, the king of Heshbon, perished. Second, that <italic>va-niram</italic> is related to <italic>yereh va-yor</italic> (shoot; and he shot) (II Kings 13:17) and <italic>yariti</italic> (cast)<sup><xref rid="fn1462">93</xref></sup> (Gen. 31:51). It means,<sup><xref rid="fn1463">94</xref></sup> when we shot them Heshbon was destroyed.</p>
<p>AND WE HAVE LAID WASTE. <italic>Va-nashim</italic> comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn1464">95</xref></sup> The <italic>chirik</italic> is in place of a short <italic>kamatz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1465">96</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>va-yasev</italic> (led about) in <italic>But God led the people about</italic> (Ex. 13:18).<sup><xref rid="fn1466">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that the <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>shin</italic> of <italic>va-nashim</italic> compensates for a missing <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1467">98</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth</italic> (Job. 35:11) wherein an <italic>alef</italic> is missing in the word <italic>mallefenu</italic> (teacheth us).<sup><xref rid="fn1468">99</xref></sup> The word <italic>va-nashim</italic> is related to the word <italic>tesham</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1469">100</xref></sup> (shall bear her guilt) in <italic>Samaria shall bear her guilt</italic> (Hos. 14:1).</p>
<p>Some say that Heshbon was always the city of Sihon.<sup><xref rid="fn1470">101</xref></sup> In this case, <italic>Come ye to Heshbon</italic> (v. 27) is the line that the poets directed at the Moabites who came as captive to Heshbon. And <italic>for a fire is gone out of Heshbon</italic> is a metaphor for the army of Sihon. When the poets speak on behalf of the Moabites, they say, we thought that Heshbon will be destroyed<sup><xref rid="fn1471">102</xref></sup> and the entire land will be laid waste even unto Nophah. Or these<sup><xref rid="fn1472">103</xref></sup> are the words of Moses.</p>
<p>33. AND THEY TURNED. I have already explained its meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn1473">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>EDREI. To Edrei. Scripture is being brief.<sup><xref rid="fn1474">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. NONE LEFT HIM REMAINING. No one of the Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn1475">106</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER 22</title>
<h1>BALAK</h1>
<p>2. TO THE AMORITES. The <italic>lamed</italic> prefixed to the word <italic>emori</italic> (Amorite) is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1476">1</xref></sup> Its reference is to the famous Amorites Sihon and Og. There were no kings among the Canaanites as great as they. <italic>Whose height was like the height of the cedars</italic> (Amos 2:9) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1477">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND MOAB WAS SORE AFRAID. <italic>Va-yagar</italic> means was afraid. <italic>Guru lakhem</italic> (be ye afraid) (Job 19:29) is similar.</p>
<p>AND MOAB WAS OVERCOME WITH DREAD. <italic>Va-yakatz</italic> (overcome with dread) has the same meaning as a similarly spelled word whose letters are inverted.<sup><xref rid="fn1478">3</xref></sup> <italic>U-nekitzennah</italic> (and vex it) in <italic>Let us go up against Judah, and vex it</italic> (Is. 7:6) is similar.</p>
<p>4. UNTO THE ELDERS OF MIDIAN. It is possible that the five Midianite kings are these same elders.<sup><xref rid="fn1479">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>NOW WILL THIS MULTITUDE LICK UP&#x2026;AS THE OX LICKETH UP. <italic>Yelachakhu</italic> (will&#x2026;lick up) and <italic>ki-lechokh</italic> (as&#x2026;licketh up) are two different conjugations.<sup><xref rid="fn1480">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. TO PETHOR. <italic>Pethorah</italic> means to Pethor.<sup><xref rid="fn1481">6</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>mitzrayemah</italic> (to Egypt) (Gen. 37:25).</p>
<p>TO THE LAND OF THE CHILDREN OF HIS PEOPLE. Who were Arameans. Scripture similarly states, <italic>from Pethor of Aram-naharaim</italic> (Deut. 23:5).</p>
<p>The midrash<sup><xref rid="fn1482">7</xref></sup> identifies Balaam with Bela.<sup><xref rid="fn1483">8</xref></sup> [However, the identification is untenable] because Balaam was an Aramean. If we identify Balaam with Bela because of Beor his father,<sup><xref rid="fn1484">9</xref></sup> then, lo and behold, the son of Ahasuerus<sup><xref rid="fn1485">10</xref></sup> lived before Ahasuerus.<sup><xref rid="fn1486">11</xref></sup> They<sup><xref rid="fn1487">12</xref></sup> are definitely two different people.</p>
<p>WHICH IS BY THE RIVER. The reference is to Aram-naharaim.</p>
<p>THE FACE OF THE EARTH. I have already explained the meaning of this expression.<sup><xref rid="fn1488">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. CURSE ME. The word <italic>arah</italic> (curse) is an imperative. It comes from a double root with one of the double letters missing. The same is true of with the word <italic>kavah</italic> (curse) in curse me (v. 18). The word <italic>kov</italic> (curse) is vocalized according to the paradigm of <italic>shemor</italic> (keep).<sup><xref rid="fn1489">14</xref></sup> <italic>Kavah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1490">15</xref></sup> in <italic>kavah li</italic> (curse me) minus the <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1491">16</xref></sup> follows the paradigm of <italic>shechav</italic> (lie), <italic>rekhav</italic> (ride), and <italic>tzelach</italic> (rested on).<sup><xref rid="fn1492">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT WE MAY SMITE THEM. <italic>Nakkeh</italic> (that we may smite them)<sup><xref rid="fn1493">18</xref></sup> is an infinitive. The fact that it ends in a <italic>heh</italic> is no argument against the latter,<sup><xref rid="fn1494">19</xref></sup> for the word <italic>le-khalle</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1495">20</xref></sup> (to finish), in <italic>to finish the transgression</italic> (Dan. 9:24) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1496">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>IS CURSED. The silent <italic>vav of yu&#x2019;ar</italic> (is cursed) is in place of a <italic>dagesh</italic>, which is in place of the missing double letter.<sup><xref rid="fn1497">22</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>yusav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1498">23</xref></sup> (turned about)<sup><xref rid="fn1499">24</xref></sup> in <italic>turned about upon the cummin</italic> (Is. 28:27). There is no other word like it in this form, because of the rules concerning gutturals.<sup><xref rid="fn1500">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THE ELDERS OF MOAB. The wise men.<sup><xref rid="fn1501">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH THE REWARDS OF DIVINATION IN THEIR HAND. Rabbi Samuel Ha-Nagid the Sephardi, of blessed memory, said that the meaning of <italic>u-kesamim</italic> (with the reward of divination)<sup><xref rid="fn1502">27</xref></sup> is payment for divination. He offers as proof the word <italic>be-yadam</italic> (in their hand).<sup><xref rid="fn1503">28</xref></sup> However, he says nothing. <italic>U-kesamim be-yadam</italic> is to be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn1504">29</xref></sup> Scripture tells us that Balak sent diviners like himself to the diviner [Balaam]. Furthermore, Balaam would not be able to tarry, saying, &#x201C;I can not find a propitious day, and a propitious hour to go and curse,&#x201D; for the messengers were members of his guild. <italic>In his right hand is the instrument of divination</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1505">30</xref></sup> (ha-kesom) (Ez. 21:27) is proof that <italic>u-kesamim be-yadam</italic> is to be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn1506">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND I WILL BRING YOU BACK WORD. After you spend the night here.</p>
<p>9. AND GOD CAME. Out of regard for Israel, for God knew the coming incident of <italic>ba&#x2019;al pe&#x2019;or</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1507">32</xref></sup> Now if Balaam had cursed them then, all of the world would have said that the plague came because of Balaam&#x2019;s curse.<sup><xref rid="fn1508">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHAT MEN ARE THESE. This was a way of opening and starting a conversation.<sup><xref rid="fn1509">34</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>Where is Abel thy brother</italic> (Gen. 4:9). Now Cain denied [knowledge of Abel&#x2019;s whereabouts]. However, God told him, <italic>the voice of thy brother&#x2019;s blood crieth out unto Me</italic> (Gen. 4 :10).<sup><xref rid="fn1510">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. FOR THEY ARE BLESSED. Its meaning is, you cannot curse them, for I have blessed them.</p>
<p>13. THE PRINCES OF BALAK. Scripture does not mention the elders of Midian,<sup><xref rid="fn1511">36</xref></sup> for Balak was the protagonist and he sent the messengers to Balaam.</p>
<p>Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen the Spaniard, of blessed memory, says that even though the <italic>yod</italic> is the sign of the object<sup><xref rid="fn1512">37</xref></sup> it can only come with a <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1513">38</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ha-lehorgeni</italic> (thinkest thou to kill me) (Ex. 2:14). It does not read <italic>ha-lehorgi</italic>. However, he forgot <italic>le-titti</italic> (to give me) in <italic>to give me leave to go with you</italic> [our verse] and <italic>yabbemi</italic> (perform the duty of a husband&#x2019;s brother unto me) in <italic>he will not perform the duty of a husband&#x2019;s brother unto me</italic> (Deut. 25:7).<sup><xref rid="fn1514">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jonah the grammarian says that the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>le-titti</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1515">40</xref></sup> is superfluous, but what he says is incorrect.<sup><xref rid="fn1516">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>[14. TO COME WITH US.]<sup><xref rid="fn1517">42</xref></sup> Its meaning is, to go with us from his place.</p>
<p>15. MORE. The word <italic>rabbim</italic> (more) is to be taken literally,<sup><xref rid="fn1518">43</xref></sup> or it is to be rendered as great.<sup><xref rid="fn1519">44</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>to all the officers</italic> (rav) <italic>of his house</italic> (Esth. 1:8)<sup><xref rid="fn1520">45</xref></sup> and <italic>The city</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1521">46</xref></sup> <italic>of the great king</italic> (rav) (Ps. 48:3), that is, David, for the city was called <italic>the city where David encamped</italic> (Is. 29:1).</p>
<p>17. FOR I WILL PROMOTE THEE. With money.</p>
<p>AND WHATSOEVER THOU SAYEST UNTO ME I WILL DO. If this is necessary for you to curse them. Balaam&#x2019;s statement, <italic>If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold</italic>, is proof that the meaning of <italic>For I will promote</italic> is, and I will promote you with money.<sup><xref rid="fn1522">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. HIS HOUSE FULL. <italic>Melo beto</italic> means his house full.<sup><xref rid="fn1523">48</xref></sup> <italic>Melo khol ha-aretz kevodo</italic> (the whole earth is full of His glory) (Is. 6:3) is similar. Many err who thought that the meaning of the latter is that the contents of the earth is God&#x2019;s glory,<sup><xref rid="fn1524">49</xref></sup> as in <italic>the earth is the Lord&#x2019;s, and the fulness thereof</italic> (Ps. 24:1).</p>
<p>SMALL OR GREAT. The words <italic>ketannah</italic> (small) and <italic>gedolah</italic> (great) are adjectives. However, the nouns<sup><xref rid="fn1525">50</xref></sup> are missing. <italic>But the rich man answers impudent</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1526">51</xref></sup> (Prov. 18:23)<sup><xref rid="fn1527">52</xref></sup> and, <italic>and his food fat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1528">53</xref></sup> (Hab. 1:16)<sup><xref rid="fn1529">54</xref></sup> are similar.</p>
<p>19. HERE.<sup><xref rid="fn1530">55</xref></sup> In this place.</p>
<p>The Gaon, of blessed memory,<sup><xref rid="fn1531">56</xref></sup> says: Should someone argue and say, &#x201C;How could God tell Balaam rise up, <italic>go with them</italic> (v. 20) after telling him <italic>Thou shalt not go with them</italic> (12)?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1532">57</xref></sup> Then we can answer him that God did not want Balaam to go with these messengers but to wait until Balak sent messengers more honorable than they.</p>
<p>However, I believe that there is no need for the Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation. Its meaning is similar to God telling Israel, <italic>Send thou men</italic> (Num. 13:2) and <italic>go up, take possession</italic> (Deut. 1:21). Israel did not believe.<sup><xref rid="fn1533">58</xref></sup> On the contrary, they said, <italic>Let us send men before us</italic> (Deut. 1:22). Moses then asked God.<sup><xref rid="fn1534">59</xref></sup> God told him, <italic>Send thou men</italic> (Num. 13:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1535">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now after God told Balaam, <italic>thou shalt not curse the people</italic> (v. 12), what need did Balaam have to say, <italic>that I may know what the Lord will speak unto me more</italic> (v. 19)? Balaam had an evil thought in his heart. God told him go with the men, but take care that you do not say anything save that which I will tell you. <italic>And God&#x2019;s anger was kindled because he went</italic> (v. 22) is proof that my explanation is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn1536">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND SADDLED. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn1537">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. FOR AN ADVERSARY AGAINST HIM. I have already explained in the Book of Job that the adversary was an angel.<sup><xref rid="fn1538">63</xref></sup> The words of the Gaon that the adversary was a human being do not help or hinder.<sup><xref rid="fn1539">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. OUT OF THE WAY. Which was trodden.<sup><xref rid="fn1540">65</xref></sup> The ass went into a field wherein there was no path.</p>
<p>TO TURN HER INTO THE WAY. The phrase <italic>le-hatotah ha-derekh</italic> (to turn her the way)<sup><xref rid="fn1541">66</xref></sup> is abridged. It means to turn her into the way.</p>
<p>24. IN A HOLLOW WAY BETWEEN THE VINEYARDS. The word <italic>mishol</italic> (hollow way) is to be interpreted according to its context, for it is not found again in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1542">67</xref></sup> It should be explained as the Aramaic translation renders it.<sup><xref rid="fn1543">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND SHE THRUST HERSELF UNTO THE WALL. <italic>Va-tillachetz</italic> is to be rendered, and she thrust herself.<sup><xref rid="fn1544">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNTO THE WALL. The reference is to the fence.<sup><xref rid="fn1545">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE SMOTE HER AGAIN. For he had already hit her when she turned into the field.<sup><xref rid="fn1546">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AND THE LORD OPENED THE MOUTH OF THE ASS. The rabbis, of blessed memory, said that ten things were created on Sabbath eve at twilight.<sup><xref rid="fn1547">72</xref></sup> I believe that this means that God specifically decreed the creation of these miraculous phenomena,<sup><xref rid="fn1548">73</xref></sup> for they are beyond the laws of nature.<sup><xref rid="fn1549">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn1550">75</xref></sup> says that the ass did not speak. Rabbi Samuel the son of Hofni attacked the Gaon.<sup><xref rid="fn1551">76</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Samuel the Spanish poet tried to save the one who was attacked.<sup><xref rid="fn1552">77</xref></sup> Note, the rationalists had a need for a non-literal interpretation of our text, for they said that God would not create signs in the world to change the laws which he created.<sup><xref rid="fn1553">78</xref></sup> He would do so only to justify his prophet.<sup><xref rid="fn1554">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, they did not speak the truth, for, look, a miracle was done for Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who were not prophets.<sup><xref rid="fn1555">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some of them<sup><xref rid="fn1556">81</xref></sup> say that Balaam was a prophet.<sup><xref rid="fn1557">82</xref></sup> However, the truth is that his prophecy<sup><xref rid="fn1558">83</xref></sup> was because of Israel&#x2019;s glory, for Balaam was a diviner. Indeed, this is how Scripture refers to him.<sup><xref rid="fn1559">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that Balaam knew the mind of the heavenly beings and was able to channel them by images that he made.<sup><xref rid="fn1560">85</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>and he whom thou cursest is cursed</italic> (v. 6).</p>
<p>However, it appears to me that Balaam was an astrologer. When Balaam saw in the star of a given person that an evil time had befallen him, he would curse him. When evil befell the one whom he cursed, then those who witnessed and heard the imprecation thought that the evil came because of Balaam&#x2019;s curse. The fact that Balaam spoke with guile to the lords of Balak is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1561">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>I can not go beyond the word of the Lord my God</italic> (v. 18) is, it is not in the hand of any created being to change a deed or a decree of God. The secret is, the part<sup><xref rid="fn1562">87</xref></sup> can not change a part.<sup><xref rid="fn1563">88</xref></sup> It is only the decree of the All<sup><xref rid="fn1564">89</xref></sup> which can change the decree of the part.<sup><xref rid="fn1565">90</xref></sup> I cannot reveal this secret for it is very deep. The correct interpretation is, the ass spoke.</p>
<p>If you understand the secret of the angels of Abraham<sup><xref rid="fn1566">91</xref></sup> and of Jacob,<sup><xref rid="fn1567">92</xref></sup> then you will understand the truth.<sup><xref rid="fn1568">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WITH HIS STAFF.] Scripture states this because Balaam first hit her with a small piece of wood or with a strap.</p>
<p>TIMES. I have already explained the meaning of the term <italic>regalim</italic> (times).<sup><xref rid="fn1569">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. HAST MOCKED. I have already explained the term <italic>hitalalt</italic> (hast mocked).<sup><xref rid="fn1570">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. ALL THY LIFE LONG. This means from the day that you started to ride.</p>
<p>WAS I EVER WONT. The meaning of <italic>ha-hasken hiskanti</italic> is, was I ever wont. Its import is, was this my manner. The word <italic>hasken</italic> (acquaint)<sup><xref rid="fn1571">96</xref></sup> in <italic>Acquaint</italic> (hasken) <italic>now thyself with him</italic> (Job 22:21) is similar.</p>
<p>31. THEN THE LORD OPENED.

<p>If <italic>yirteni</italic> comes from the root <italic>yod, resh, tet</italic>, then it should be vocalized like <italic>ye&#x2019;atani</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1581">106</xref></sup> (He hath covered me) (Is. 61:10).<sup><xref rid="fn1582">107</xref></sup> <italic>Yarat</italic> and <italic>yirteni</italic> have similar meanings even though they come from two different roots.<sup><xref rid="fn1583">108</xref></sup> We find the same to be the case with the word <italic>ye&#x2019;atani</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.), which is vocalized like the word <italic>ye&#x2019;atzani</italic> (given me counsel) (Ps. 16:7).<sup><xref rid="fn1584">109</xref></sup> <italic>Ye&#x2019;atani</italic> is similar in meaning to <italic>oteh</italic> (coverest)<sup><xref rid="fn1585">110</xref></sup> in (Who coverest Thyself with light) (Ps. 104:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1586">111</xref></sup></p>

<p>The above is explained by the following.<sup><xref rid="fn1594">119</xref></sup> When a person sees an angel, he dies. <italic>And my life is preserved</italic> (Gen. 32:1),<sup><xref rid="fn1595">120</xref></sup> and the words of Manoah<sup><xref rid="fn1596">121</xref></sup> are proof.

<p>37. WHEREFORE CAMEST THOU NOT UNTO ME. The word <italic>halakhta</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1597">122</xref></sup> is to be rendered camest because it is followed by <italic>elai</italic> (unto me).

<p>Observe, Balaam was divining<sup><xref rid="fn1625">25</xref></sup> when he went,<sup><xref rid="fn1626">26</xref></sup> for Scripture clearly states, <italic>he went not, as at other times</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1627">27</xref></sup> <italic>to meet with enchantments</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1628">28</xref></sup> (Num. 24:1). See, I have given you a hint regarding a sealed secret.<sup><xref rid="fn1629">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND I HAVE OFFERED UP A BULLOCK AND A RAM ON EVERY ALTAR. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn1630">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND HE TOOK UP HIS PARABLE, AND SAID. The parable referred to is, <italic>For from the top of rocks I see him</italic> (v. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn1631">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF THE EAST. The word <italic>kedem</italic> means east.<sup><xref rid="fn1632">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>COME, CURSE ME JACOB. &#x201C;And he said&#x201D; has been omitted from our clause.<sup><xref rid="fn1633">33</xref></sup> We find many such instances in the Song of Songs. This is an abridged style.</p>
<p>EXECRATE ISRAEL. Scripture repeats itself <sup><xref rid="fn1634">34</xref></sup> as is its custom. Its manner is to employ different words to express the same thought. It repeats itself for emphasis.</p>
<p>The word <italic>zo&#x2019;amah</italic> (execrate)<sup><xref rid="fn1635">35</xref></sup> should have been vocalized like the word <italic>zokhrah</italic> (remember)<sup><xref rid="fn1636">36</xref></sup> in <italic>Remember unto me, O my God</italic> (Neh. 5:19). However, since the <italic>ayin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1637">37</xref></sup> was vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1638">38</xref></sup> because it is a guttural, a <italic>cholam</italic> rather than a short <italic>kamatz</italic> was placed between it and the <italic>zayin</italic>.</p>
<p>8. HOW SHALL I CURSE, WHOM GOD HATH NOT CURSED. The word <italic>kabboh</italic> means to curse. Its <italic>heh</italic> is in place of a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1639">39</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>oholoh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1640">40</xref></sup> (his tent) (Gen. 12:8) and the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>fera&#x2019;oh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1641">41</xref></sup> (let them loose) in <italic>for Aaron had let them loose</italic> (Ex. 32:25). <italic>Kabboh</italic> comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn1642">42</xref></sup> Its full form<sup><xref rid="fn1643">43</xref></sup> is <italic>kavevo</italic> (they curse him). Compare, <italic>savevo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1644">44</xref></sup> (they surrounded him) although it is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn1645">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HOW SHALL I EXECRATE, WHOM GOD HATH NOT EXECRATED. The words <italic>ezam</italic> (shall I execrate) and <italic>za&#x2019;am</italic> (execrate) come from the root, <italic>zayin, ayin, mem</italic> (anger). Scripture repeats itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1646">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. FOR FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCKS I SEE HIM. Balaam said this because he was high up on the hill. He went not, as at other times, to meet with enchantments. <italic>But he set his face toward the wilderness</italic> (Num. 24:1)<sup><xref rid="fn1647">47</xref></sup> and not toward the high place<sup><xref rid="fn1648">48</xref></sup> is proof that my interpretation of <italic>shefi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1649">49</xref></sup> is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn1650">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also likely that <italic>from the top of the rocks</italic> is a parable symbolizing the decrees that come down from heaven. For Balaam in his wisdom<sup><xref rid="fn1651">51</xref></sup> saw that this nation would stand alone and not intermingle with other nations that would overpower her and try to force her to give up God&#x2019;s Torah, as the nations did.</p>
<p>AND SHALL NOT BE RECKONED AMONG THE NATIONS. I will explain this in my comments on <italic>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance</italic> (Deut. 32:8).</p>
<p>10. WHO HATH COUNTED. It is a wonder that Israel is not counted with the nations, when they are a nation as numerous as the sand. It is likely for a small nation not to be counted.<sup><xref rid="fn1652">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE DUST OF JACOB. Its meaning is: Jacob is as numerous as the dust of the earth.</p>
<p>OR NUMBERED THE STOCK OF ISRAEL? One standard.<sup><xref rid="fn1653">53</xref></sup> It means the same as <italic>thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all</italic> (v. 13).<sup><xref rid="fn1654">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>[LET ME DIE THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS, AND LET MINE END BE LIKE HIS&#x0021;] The Aramaic translator beautifully explained the meaning of <italic>yesharim</italic> (the righteous).<sup><xref rid="fn1655">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that Balaam wanted to die. He wanted his end to be like the end of Israel, who are God&#x2019;s portion and are not ruled by the stars, for he was a magician.<sup><xref rid="fn1656">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that <italic>mine end</italic> repeats <italic>let me die</italic>. Balaam wanted to die like the righteous of Israel, for he knew that he would die by the sword.<sup><xref rid="fn1657">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn1658">58</xref></sup> says that <italic>Who hath counted</italic> refers to God. Our verse means: You who are able to count the dust of Jacob, give me the death of the righteous. However, if this is so, then what meaning is there to <italic>Or numbered the stock of Israel</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn1659">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many explain that <italic>rova</italic> (the stock of) is similar in meaning to <italic>rivi</italic>, which means my lying down. Compare, <italic>Thou measurest my going about and my lying down</italic> (rivi) (Ps. 139:3). They explain that the <italic>dust of Jacob</italic> refers to the time that Jacob journeys.<sup><xref rid="fn1660">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. [THOU HAST BLESSED THEM ALTOGETHER.] It is normal usage to place the infinitive first in the perfect and then the imperfect.<sup><xref rid="fn1661">61</xref></sup> The reverse is true in the imperative.<sup><xref rid="fn1662">62</xref></sup> However, there are irregular phrases such as <italic>u-verakhta barekh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1663">63</xref></sup> (thou hast blessed them altogether) (Num. 24:10); <italic>and yava vo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1664">64</xref></sup> (and he shall come on) in <italic>and he shall come on, and overflow, as he passeth through</italic> (Dan. 11:1).</p>
<p>13. BUT THE UTMOST. The meaning of <italic>efes katzehu</italic> is, but the utmost.</p>
<p>AND CURSE ME THEM. <italic>Ve-kovno</italic> (and curse them) is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn1665">65</xref></sup> According to the rules of grammar the imperative is the same as the imperfect.<sup><xref rid="fn1666">66</xref></sup> The only difference between them is the prefix.<sup><xref rid="fn1667">67</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>yirdefehu</italic> (he shall pursue him); <italic>yirdefenu</italic> (he shall pursue him); <italic>yirdefuhu</italic> (they shall pursue him); and <italic>yirdefo</italic> (shall pursue him<sup><xref rid="fn1668">68</xref></sup>) in <italic>The enemy shall pursue him</italic> (Hos. 8:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1669">69</xref></sup> However, <italic>kovno</italic> comes with a <italic>nun</italic> vocalized with a <italic>cholam</italic> joined to the root.</p>
<p>According to Rabbi Judah, the first grammarian, the word <italic>kovno</italic> comes from the root <italic>kof, bet, nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1670">70</xref></sup> If this is the case, then <italic>kovno</italic> cannot be an imperative, for we do not find such a vocalization in the <italic>kal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1671">71</xref></sup> Perhaps <italic>kovno</italic> is an infinitive vocalized like the word <italic>shomro</italic> (keep) in <italic>and because He would keep the oath</italic> (Deut. 7:8).</p>
<p>18. AND HE TOOK UP HIS PARABLE. The reference is to <italic>like the lofty horns of the wild-ox</italic> (v. 22) and <italic>a people that riseth up as a lioness</italic> (v. 24).</p>
<p>GIVE EAR UNTO ME. The word <italic>adai</italic> (unto me) is related to the word <italic>ad</italic> (unto). The word <italic>adai</italic> (unto Me) in <italic>Yet have ye not returned unto Me</italic> (Amos 4:6) is similar.</p>
<p>Scripture repeats itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1672">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>beno tzippor</italic> (son of Zippor) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1673">73</xref></sup> It is similar to the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>le-mayeno</italic> (a fountain) in <italic>into a fountain of waters</italic> (Ps. 114:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1674">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>[19. GOD IS NOT A MAN.] Balaam said this in response to Balak&#x2019;s request, <italic>and curse me them from thence</italic> (v. 13). However, Balaam had already told him, <italic>God hath not cursed</italic> (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn1675">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHEN HE HATH SAID, WILL HE NOT DO IT? His word.<sup><xref rid="fn1676">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR WHEN HE HATH SPOKEN. A word.</p>
<p>20. BEHOLD, I AM BIDDEN TO BLESS. <italic>Barekh</italic> (to bless)<sup><xref rid="fn1677">77</xref></sup> is an infinitive. It has the same meaning as a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn1678">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WHEN HE HATH BLESSED. <italic>U-verekh</italic> (and when he hath blessed) is a verb in the perfect. Its meaning is, when God pronounced a blessing, I cannot call it back.</p>
<p>21. NONE HATH BEHELD INIQUITY IN JACOB.<sup><xref rid="fn1679">79</xref></sup> I believe that Balak learned from this utterance to send Moabite women into the camp of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1680">80</xref></sup> Scripture&#x2019;s meaning is that God is not like a man that he should repent (v. 19), for He did not see iniquity in Israel. However, if there be iniquity in Israel, then God&#x2019;s word will not come to pass, for all of God&#x2019;s words are conditional unless accompanied by an oath. Compare, <italic>At one instant I may speak concerning a nation&#x2026;to build and to plant&#x2026;but if it do evil in My sight&#x2026;then I repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit it</italic>. (Jer. 18:7-10). This is the meaning of Balaam&#x2019;s statement.</p>
<p>NEITHER HATH ONE SEEN PERVERSENESS IN ISRAEL.<sup><xref rid="fn1681">81</xref></sup> Scripture repeats itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1682">82</xref></sup> The word <italic>amal</italic> (perverseness) is brother to <italic>aven</italic> (iniquity). <italic>Amal</italic> (perverseness) is so called because iniquity (<italic>aven</italic>) ultimately leads to it. Look, as long as God does not see iniquity in Jacob, He is with Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1683">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE SHOUTING FOR<sup><xref rid="fn1684">84</xref></sup> THE KING IS AMONG THEM. In the camp of Israel. The reference is to <italic>and when ye blow an alarm</italic> (tru&#x2019;ah) (Num. 10:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1685">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. GOD WHO BROUGHT THEM FORTH OUT OF EGYPT. This God who brought them out of Egypt is mighty and showed his miracles in Egypt.</p>
<p>LIKE THE LOFTY HORNS OF THE WILD-OX. <italic>Ke-to&#x2019;afot re&#x2019;em</italic> (like the lofty horns of the wild-ox) is similar to <italic>karne re&#x2019;em</italic> (the horns of the wild-ox) (Deut. 33:17).<sup><xref rid="fn1686">86</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>to&#x2019;afot is</italic>, the might of.<sup><xref rid="fn1687">87</xref></sup> <italic>To&#x2019;afot</italic> (the heights of) in <italic>The heights of the mountain are His also</italic> (Ps. 95:4) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1688">88</xref></sup> It is also possible that the meaning<sup><xref rid="fn1689">89</xref></sup> of <italic>ve-to&#x2019;afot harim lo</italic> (the heights of the mountains are His) is, the horns of the mountains are also His.<sup><xref rid="fn1690">90</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ve-kehsef to&#x2019;afot lakh</italic> (and precious silver unto thee) (Job 22:25) is, and silver, as mighty as the mountains.<sup><xref rid="fn1691">91</xref></sup> Scripture reads <italic>lo</italic> (to him). [It means to them.] Compare, <italic>and the shouting for the King is among them</italic> (v. 21). It means that this God made Israel strong. God did all this for them because Israel cleaves to God and does not seek anything from anyone but the Lord, for they have no need for an enchanter and a diviner.</p>
<p>23. NOW IT IS SAID OF JACOB. <italic>Ka-et</italic> (now) is to be rendered, like this time.<sup><xref rid="fn1692">92</xref></sup> Its meaning is: at all times it will be told to them without the assistance of an enchanter.<sup><xref rid="fn1693">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT. <italic>Mah pa&#x2019;al el</italic> (what hath God wrought) is to be rendered, what God shall do. All things decreed, even those decreed for the future, are decreed in the past. Hence Scripture employs a perfect (<italic>pa&#x2019;al)</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1694">94</xref></sup> This will be told to Israel prophetically. What is told in prophecy is the truth.</p>
<p>OF JACOB AND OF ISRAEL. Scripture repeats itself in a prophetic utterance. Compare, <italic>From the top of Senir and Hermon</italic> (Song of Songs 4:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1695">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. BEHOLD A PEOPLE THAT RISETH UP AS A LIONESS. This hints that Israel will conquer the kings of Canaan. It seems most logical to interpret it this way regarding a soon-to-occur event,<sup><xref rid="fn1696">96</xref></sup> such as the war against Midian.<sup><xref rid="fn1697">97</xref></sup> A war like it was unprecedented. No Israelites were lost in this war<sup><xref rid="fn1698">98</xref></sup> and five kings died in it,<sup><xref rid="fn1699">99</xref></sup> along with thirty-two thousand females who never slept with a man.<sup><xref rid="fn1700">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND DRINK THE BLOOD OF THE SLAIN. The spoil and all their wealth.<sup><xref rid="fn1701">101</xref></sup> According to the midrashic interpretation it means that Moses would not die until he ate of the prey.<sup><xref rid="fn1702">102</xref></sup> Scripture similarly reads: <italic>Afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people</italic> (Num. 31:2).</p>
<p>27. THAT THOU MAYEST CURSE ME THEM. <italic>Ve-kabbota</italic> (that thou mayest curse) comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn1703">103</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ve-sabboti ani</italic> (therefore I turned) (Eccles. 2:20).<sup><xref rid="fn1704">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. UNTO THE TOP OF PEOR. Balaam did not seek to use sorcery, so God&#x2019;s spirit came upon him. Balaam acted like this because he saw <italic>that there is no enchantment with Jacob</italic> (Num. 23:23).</p>
<ftnote id="fn1601"><sup>1</sup> The seventh day is holy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1602"><sup>2</sup> Rosh Ha-Shanah falls on the first day of the seventh month.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1607"><sup>7</sup> To seven. When seven bullocks are added to seven lambs and placed on seven altars. Or when seven animals are sacrificed to God the complete, the celebrant is prophetically inspired.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1611"><sup>11</sup> Balaam used all seven altars. However, Scripture tells us what he offered on one of the altars.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 24</title>
<p>1. BUT HE SET HIS FACE TOWARD THE WILDERNESS. Where Israel was, in the plains of Moab.</p>
<p>2. DWELLING TRIBE BY TRIBE. He saw all the standards.<sup><xref rid="fn1705">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that Balaam had a diabolical eye. Such people are called evildoers. Balaam did evil by employing his diabolic eye. I have already made my opinion known to you.<sup><xref rid="fn1706">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND HE TOOK UP HIS PARABLE.<sup><xref rid="fn1707">3</xref></sup> This means he lifted up his voice and uttered his parable. The parable was, <italic>As valleys stretched out</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1708">4</xref></sup> (v. 6).</p>
<p>THE SAYING OF. The word <italic>ne&#x2019;um</italic> means the saying of. Compare, <italic>va-yimamu ne&#x2019;um</italic> (and say: He saith) (Jer. 23:31).</p>
<p>Some say that <italic>who heareth</italic> and also <italic>Who seeth</italic> means who hears and who sees by divination. However, it most likely refers to that which is heard and seen in a prophetic dream. Compare Eliphaz&#x2019;s statement, <italic>A form was before mine eyes; I heard a still voice</italic> (Job 4:16).<sup><xref rid="fn1709">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHOSE EYE IS OPENED. The word <italic>shetum</italic> (opened) has no brother.<sup><xref rid="fn1710">6</xref></sup> It can be interpreted only in context. <italic>Shetum</italic> is the opposite of <italic>setum</italic> (shut).<sup><xref rid="fn1711">7</xref></sup> Some say that Balaam had only one eye.<sup><xref rid="fn1712">8</xref></sup> However, this is a midrashic interpretation.</p>
<p>4. FALLEN DOWN. Compare, <italic>a deep sleep fell upon Abram</italic> (Gen. 15:12).<sup><xref rid="fn1713">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>YET WITH OPENED EYES. Even though he sleeps, he sees with his eyes. Compare, [<italic>I sleep</italic>] <italic>but my heart waketh</italic> (Cant. 5:2).</p>
<p>5. HOW GOODLY. <italic>Tovu</italic> (goodly) is a verb in the perfect. It is similar to <italic>oru</italic> (are brightened) in <italic>how mine eyes have brightened</italic> (I Sam. 14:29).</p>
<p>6. STRETCHED OUT. The <italic>tet</italic> of <italic>nittayu</italic> (stretched out) rceives a <italic>dagesh</italic> to compensate for the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>natah</italic> (stretched),<sup><xref rid="fn1714">10</xref></sup> which is swallowed.<sup><xref rid="fn1715">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture reads <italic>stretched out</italic> because there are rivers that turn here and there and have trees over them.</p>
<p>AS ALOES. <italic>Ahalim</italic> (aloes) is similar to the word <italic>ahalot</italic> (aloes) in <italic>myrrh, and aloes</italic> (Ps. 45:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1716">12</xref></sup> Note, Balaam compares the tents<sup><xref rid="fn1717">13</xref></sup> to stretched-out rivers.<sup><xref rid="fn1718">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>AS CEDARS. Scripture repeats itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1719">15</xref></sup> Balaam mentions cedars in the sense of <italic>He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon</italic> (Ps. 92:13).</p>
<p>7. WATER SHALL FLOW. Look, <italic>mayim</italic> is in the singular.<sup><xref rid="fn1720">16</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>the water of</italic> (mai) <italic>sprinkling was not dashed</italic> (zorak)<sup><xref rid="fn1721">17</xref></sup> <italic>against him</italic> (Num. 19:13).</p>
<p>FROM HIS BRANCHES. <italic>Dalyo</italic> (his branches) is similar to <italic>daliyyotav</italic> (his branches) (Jer. 11:16).</p>
<p>AND HIS SEED SHALL BE IN MANY WATERS. Like seed saturated with water. This means he shall flourish and grow every day.</p>
<p>AND HIS KING SHALL BE HIGHER THAN AGAG. This is a prophecy regarding Saul, Israel&#x2019;s first king, for prior to Saul there were judges but no kings.</p>
<p>8. GOD WHO BROUGHT HIM FORTH. The meaning of our verse is: the God who brought him [Israel] out of Egypt made him as powerful as the lofty horns of the wild-ox. Let not the one who would dispute this claim that the word him<sup><xref rid="fn1722">18</xref></sup> refers to God, because Scripture earlier used the plural form <italic>motzi&#x2019;am</italic> (brought them forth) when it stated, <italic>God who brought them forth</italic> (Num. 23:22).<sup><xref rid="fn1723">19</xref></sup> For such is the style of Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1724">20</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And they</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1725">21</xref></sup> <italic>sit at Thy feet; he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1726">22</xref></sup> <italic>receives</italic> (yissa) <italic>Thy words</italic> (Deut. 33:3); and <italic>How long will this</italic> (ha-zeh)<sup><xref rid="fn1727">23</xref></sup> <italic>people despise Me</italic> (yena&#x2019;atzuni)<sup><xref rid="fn1728">24</xref></sup> (Num. 14:11). There are many such instances.</p>
<p>HE SHALL EAT UP THE NATIONS THAT ARE HIS ADVERSARIES. The reference is to the kings of Canaan.</p>
<p>AND SHALL BREAK THEIR BONES IN PIECES. <italic>Garem</italic> means a bone. <italic>Yigarem</italic> means he shall break their bones.<sup><xref rid="fn1729">25</xref></sup> The word <italic>itzemo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1730">26</xref></sup> (hath broken his bones) (Jer. 50:17) is similar. So too is the word <italic>mesa&#x2019;ef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1731">27</xref></sup> (shall lop) in <italic>Shall lop the boughs with terror</italic> (Is. 10:33) and <italic>tefa&#x2019;er</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1732">28</xref></sup> (go over the boughs) in <italic>thou shalt not go over the boughs</italic> (Deut. 24 :20).<sup><xref rid="fn1733">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND PIERCE THEM THROUGH WITH HIS ARROWS. Each one of his arrows shall pierce.<sup><xref rid="fn1734">30</xref></sup> So too, <italic>But the righteous are secure as a young lion</italic> (Prov. 28:1);<sup><xref rid="fn1735">31</xref></sup> <italic>Its branches run over the wall</italic> (Gen. 49:22); <italic>Blessed be every one that blesseth thee</italic> (v. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn1736">32</xref></sup> The latter means, everyone that blesses you wil be blessed. So too, <italic>and cursed be everyone that curseth thee</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).</p>
<p>9. HE COUCHED. The meaning of our verse is: Israel will inherit Canaan, after which the land will be quiet.</p>
<p>SHALL ROUSE HIM UP. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn1737">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND HE SMOTE HIS HANDS TOGETHER. <italic>Va-yispok</italic> (and he smote) is similar to <italic>safeku</italic> (clap) in <italic>All that pass by clap Their hands at thee</italic> (Lam. 2:15).</p>
<p>14. AND I WILL ANNOUNCE<sup><xref rid="fn1738">34</xref></sup> TO THEE. Some say that its meaning is: I will advise you with regard to the daughters of Moab. However, this is far-fetched, for Scripture says, <italic>in the end of days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1739">35</xref></sup> I believe that we should take it according to its plain meaning; namely, I will advise you, so that you know what you should do, for this people will do this to your people.<sup><xref rid="fn1740">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND KNOWETH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOST HIGH. By prophecy, not through enchantment.</p>
<p>17. I SEE HIM, BUT NOT NOW. It appears to me that this prophecy refers to King David. Balaam said but not now, for it referred to an event four hundred years later.</p>
<p>I BEHOLD HIM, BUT NOT NIGH. Scripture repeats itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1741">37</xref></sup> The star and the sceptre are the parable.</p>
<p>THERE SHALL STEP FORTH A STAR. There are images of stars that step forth in the sky that never existed and were never known.<sup><xref rid="fn1742">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND A SCEPTRE<sup><xref rid="fn1743">39</xref></sup> SHALL ARISE. The reference is to a royal sceptre.</p>
<p>I believe that <italic>shall step</italic> means that the star shall be seen making its way, as in <italic>The stars in their courses</italic> (Jud. 5:20). Many explained that the reference is to the messiah.</p>
<p>The ancients said that Sanherib<sup><xref rid="fn1744">40</xref></sup> mixed up the nations.<sup><xref rid="fn1745">41</xref></sup> However, note that Scripture speaks of Moab, Amalek, and Asshur.<sup><xref rid="fn1746">42</xref></sup> Furthermore, why does Balaam conclude with <italic>and shall afflict Eber</italic> (v. 24)?<sup><xref rid="fn1747">43</xref></sup> On the contrary, Balaam should have ended his parable with <italic>There shall step forth a star out of Jacob</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1748">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those who lack intelligence think that anyone who explains that <italic>There shall step forth a star</italic> refers to King David denies the coming of the messiah.<sup><xref rid="fn1749">45</xref></sup> Far be it, far be it, for the messiah is clearly stated in the prophecy of Daniel. I have already explained that Daniel first mentions the coming into existence of the Greek kings<sup><xref rid="fn1750">46</xref></sup> and the arising of the Hasmoneans. He mentions the existence of the second temple, the years of the siege, the exile, and the salvation. He notes these things in order.</p>
<p>There is no conceivable need for another prophet,<sup><xref rid="fn1751">47</xref></sup> since we have the words of Moses, who is the most important prophet: <italic>If any of thine that are dispersed be in the uttermost parts of heaven&#x2026; the Lord thy God will bring thee</italic> (Deut. 30:4,5).<sup><xref rid="fn1752">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SHALL SMITE THROUGH THE CORNERS OF MOAB. This is what David did.<sup><xref rid="fn1753">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BREAK DOWN. The word <italic>karkar</italic> (break down) is similar to <italic>mekarkar kir</italic> (Is. 22:5), the meaning of which is, breaking the wall. It is similar to the word <italic>mesa&#x2019;ef</italic> (shall lop) (Is. 10:33).<sup><xref rid="fn1754">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE SONS OF SETH. People. Seth was the most important son of Adam, for Noah was descended from him.</p>
<p>Yitzchaki<sup><xref rid="fn1755">51</xref></sup> says that the reference is to the Amonites and the Moabites, and that Scripture repeats itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1756">52</xref></sup> He also says that the word Seth is derived from the word <italic>shet</italic> (buttocks) in <italic>and with buttocks uncovered</italic> (Is. 20:4) and that it alludes to the daughters<sup><xref rid="fn1757">53</xref></sup> of Lot.<sup><xref rid="fn1758">54</xref></sup> However, this appears to me to be farfetched, for <italic>shet</italic> refers to the backside,<sup><xref rid="fn1759">55</xref></sup> which is the foundation of the body.<sup><xref rid="fn1760">56</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ki ha-shatot yeharesun</italic> (When the foundations are destroyed) (Ps. 11:3).</p>
<p>Many others have explained that the word <italic>shet</italic> (Seth) in <italic>all the sons of Seth</italic>, is related to the word <italic>ha-shatot</italic> (foundations) in <italic>When the foundations are destroyed</italic>. It means that the cities will be destroyed.<sup><xref rid="fn1761">57</xref></sup> This interpretation is not far-fetched.</p>
<p>18. AND EDOM SHALL BE A POSSESSION. The word <italic>yereshah</italic> (possession) is related to the word <italic>torishu</italic> (drive out)<sup><xref rid="fn1762">58</xref></sup> in <italic>But if ye will not drive out</italic> (Num. 33:55).<sup><xref rid="fn1763">59</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Yereshah</italic> is a noun vocalized according to the pattern of the word <italic>levenah</italic> (tile) in <italic>take thee a tile</italic> (Ezek. 4:1). It is in place of an adjective. Compare the word <italic>shemamah</italic> (desolation) in <italic>and it shall be a desolation</italic> (Is. 17:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1764">60</xref></sup> We know that David&#x2019;s hand overpowered Edom<sup><xref rid="fn1765">61</xref></sup> and Mount Seir.<sup><xref rid="fn1766">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND OUT OF JACOB SHALL ONE HAVE DOMINION.<sup><xref rid="fn1767">63</xref></sup> A ruler shall arise out of Jacob.</p>
<p>AND SHALL DESTROY THE REMNANT FROM THE CITY. From every city.<sup><xref rid="fn1768">64</xref></sup> Its meaning is, from Edom. The reference is to Joab, for Scripture clearly states, <italic>and had smitten every male in Edom</italic> (I Kings 11:15).</p>
<p>20. AND HE LOOKED ON AMALEK. Via prophecy.<sup><xref rid="fn1769">65</xref></sup> <italic>The first of the nations</italic> is the parable. It means Amalek was the first nation to wage war against Israel, but his end shall be utter destruction. This<sup><xref rid="fn1770">66</xref></sup> took place in the days of Saul, who slew <italic>man and woman, infant and suckling</italic> (I Sam. 15:3) and old men.</p>
<p>Many explain that the meaning of <italic>the first of the nations</italic> is that Amalek was considered to be the head of the nations. However, this was not the case.<sup><xref rid="fn1771">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND HE LOOKED ON THE KENITE.<sup><xref rid="fn1772">68</xref></sup> The family of Jethro. Scripture writes, <italic>These are the Kenites</italic> (I Chron. 2:55) and <italic>Now Heber the Kenite</italic> (Jud. 4:11).<sup><xref rid="fn1773">69</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>And though thy nest be set in the rock</italic> is the parable.<sup><xref rid="fn1774">70</xref></sup> The latter repeats the preceding clause.<sup><xref rid="fn1775">71</xref></sup> Its meaning is, though your dwelling place be as high as the nest of a bird, it will not save you.</p>
<p>22. KAIN SHALL BE WASTED. <italic>Le-va&#x2019;er</italic> (wasted) is similar to the word <italic>le-va&#x2019;er</italic> (eaten up) in <italic>it shall again be eaten up</italic> (Is. 6:13); and <italic>yeva&#x2019;er</italic> (sweepeth) in <italic>as a man sweepeth away dung</italic> (I Kings 14:10); and <italic>u-vi&#x2019;arta</italic> (so shalt thou put away) in <italic>So shalt thou put away the evil from thee</italic> (Deut. 13:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1776">72</xref></sup> Kain and the Kenite are one and the same.</p>
<p>[HOW LONG? ASSHUR SHALL CARRY THEE AWAY CAPTIVE.] Balaam, as it were, said: How long shall Asshur carry thee<sup><xref rid="fn1777">73</xref></sup> away captive? He will not let go of you until you are wasted. Asshur is feminine. Asshur is short for the camp of Asshur. Compare, <italic>va-tipple sheva va-tikkachem</italic> (and the Sabeans made a raid) (Job 1:15); <italic>Va-ta&#x2019;arokh yisra&#x2019;el</italic> (and Israel&#x2026;put the battle in array) (I Sam. 17:21).</p>
<p>23. AND HE TOOK UP HIS PARABLE, AND SAID. The reference is to <italic>But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim</italic> (v. 24).</p>
<p>When Balaam mentioned that the Kenite would be carried away captive, he also said that a time would come when Asshur would be afflicted and Eber along with him. The latter refers to the Hebrews that Asshur carried away captive, for the Kenites lived with the Israelites.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the Aramaic translation is well known.<sup><xref rid="fn1778">74</xref></sup> However, it is not the practice of Scripture to mention the word <italic>ever</italic> without the word <italic>nahar</italic> (river) following it.<sup><xref rid="fn1779">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some explain that <italic>tzim</italic> (ships) is a plural. It is related to the word <italic>tzi</italic> (ship) in gallant ship (Is. 33:21). Others say that the word <italic>tzim</italic> is related to the word <italic>tziyim</italic> (wild-cats) <italic>in And the wild-cats shall meet with the jackals</italic> (Is. 34:14). Balaam compared the Kittim to wild-cats because people will be gripped by fear when they appear.<sup><xref rid="fn1780">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>[ALAS, WHO SHALL LIVE AFTER GOD HATH APPOINTED HIM.] The reference is to the king of Asshur who made himself into a god. The latter is noted in the Book of Isaiah.<sup><xref rid="fn1781">77</xref></sup> Or its meaning is: Who shall survive the decrees which God placed in the world via Asshur, for the king of Assyria conquered all the nations. The latter is clearly stated in Scripture.</p>
<p>24. OF KITTIM. They are descended from Javin, for the latter is clearly stated in Scripture (Gen. 10:4). It is also possible that Scripture alludes to the kingdom of the Greeks. I have already explained in the Book of Daniel, that the kingdom of the Greeks and that of the Kittim are one and the same.<sup><xref rid="fn1782">78</xref></sup> There is clear proof that it is the third beast.<sup><xref rid="fn1783">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM THE COAST OF KITTIM. <italic>Mi-yad</italic> (from the coast of) means from the place. Compare the word <italic>yad</italic> in <italic>the side</italic> (yad) <italic>of the Jordan</italic> (Num. 13:29) and <italic>Thou shalt have a place</italic> (Deut. 23:13).</p>
<p>AND ALSO HE. The Kittim. Kittim is singular even though it comes in the plural form. <italic>And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim</italic> (Gen. 10:4) is proof of this.</p>
<p>25. AND BALAAM ROSE UP. For he was lying down. A deep sleep had fallen over him. Scripture clearly states, <italic>Fallen down, yet with opened eyes</italic> (v. 16).</p>
<ftnote id="fn1705"><sup>1</sup> He saw Israel camped around their standards.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1706"><sup>2</sup> See I.E. on Num. 22:28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1707"><sup>3</sup> Hebrew, <italic>va-yissa meshalo va-yomar</italic>, literally, and he lifted up his parable and said. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1708"><sup>4</sup> The parable ends with verse 9. What comes before is a description, not a parable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1709"><sup>5</sup> Eliphaz was describing a vision he had when asleep.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1710"><sup>6</sup> It does not occur elsewhere in Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1711"><sup>7</sup> Thus <italic>shetum ha-ayin</italic> means whose eye is opened.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1712"><sup>8</sup> See Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1713"><sup>9</sup> In other words, <italic>fallen down</italic> means fallen down in sleep.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1714"><sup>10</sup> In other words, <italic>nittayu</italic> comes from the root <italic>nun, tet, heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1715"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Nittayu</italic> is a <italic>nifal</italic>. Its <italic>nun</italic> is the <italic>nun</italic> of the <italic>nifal</italic> form, not the <italic>nun</italic> of the root.

<title>CHAPTER 25</title>
<p>1. IN SHITTIM. For Scripture clearly states, <italic>And they pitched by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth even unto Abel-shittim</italic> (Num. 33:49).<sup><xref rid="fn1784">1</xref></sup> Everything took place in the plains of Moab, for Israel did not move from there.<sup><xref rid="fn1785">2</xref></sup> Also, Joshua sent spies from there (Josh. 2:1).</p>
<p>[AND THE PEOPLE BEGAN.] I believe that <italic>va-yachel</italic> (began) is a <italic>hifil</italic>.</p>
<p>2. AND BOWED DOWN. Israel and the daughters of Moab.<sup><xref rid="fn1786">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND ISRAEL JOINED HIMSELF. The word <italic>va-yitzamed</italic> is related to the word <italic>tzemed</italic> (yoke) in <italic>a yoke of oxen</italic> (I Sam. 11:7). The reference is to the Moabite women; that is, Israel was joined with the women in the religion of <italic>pe&#x2019;or</italic>.</p>
<p>4. AND HANG THEM. The reference is to those who were joined.<sup><xref rid="fn1787">4</xref></sup> The proof text is, <italic>And Moses said unto the judges of Israel</italic> (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn1788">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HANG THEM. <italic>Ve-hoka otam</italic> (and hang them) is similar to <italic>va-yaki&#x2019;um</italic> (and they hanged them) in <italic>and they hanged them in the mountain</italic> (II Sam. 21:9). It is to be understood in accordance with the words of the Aramaic translation.<sup><xref rid="fn1789">6</xref></sup> The proof text is, <italic>In the face of the sun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1790">7</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>in the face of the sun</italic> is, in public. Compare, <italic>in the sight of this sun</italic> (II Sam. 12:11).<sup><xref rid="fn1791">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. SLAY YE EVERY ONE HIS MEN. From whatever tribe they may be. It is known that they slew,<sup><xref rid="fn1792">9</xref></sup> even though Scripture does not mention this.<sup><xref rid="fn1793">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND BROUGHT UNTO HIS BRETHREN. He gave her to his family.</p>
<p>WHILE THEY WERE WEEPING. Praying to God.</p>
<p>7. AND WHEN PHINEHAS&#x2026;SAW. When Phinehas saw this, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, which was in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p>There is a question here.<sup><xref rid="fn1794">11</xref></sup> It is possible to answer that Zimri (v. 14) was joined<sup><xref rid="fn1795">12</xref></sup> in the presence of witnesses.</p>
<p>8. INTO THE CHAMBER. <italic>El ha-kubbah</italic> (into the chamber) means into the tent. The word has a similar meaning in Arabic, although there is a difference in shape between an <italic>ohel</italic> (tent) and a <italic>kubbah</italic> (chamber).<sup><xref rid="fn1796">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THRUST. <italic>Va-yidkor</italic> (and thrust) is similar to <italic>ve-dokreni</italic> (thrust me) in <italic>and thrust me through therewith</italic> (I Sam. 31:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1797">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>THROUGH HER BELLY. <italic>El kovatah</italic> (through her belly) means in the chamber, that is, in the chamber where she was with Zimri&#x2019;s brothers.</p>
<p>Others say that the word that <italic>kovatah</italic> is related to is the word <italic>kevah</italic> (maw) in <italic>the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw</italic> (Deut. 18:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1798">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is also a midrashic statement to the effect that ten miracles were performed for Phinehas.<sup><xref rid="fn1799">16</xref></sup> However, Scripture does not mention them.</p>
<h1>PHINEHAS</h1>
<p>11. IN THAT HE WAS VERY JEALOUS FOR MY SAKE AMONG THEM. There is no <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>be-kano</italic> (in that he was very jealous) in order to simplify enunciation.<sup><xref rid="fn1800">17</xref></sup> It means that Phinehas was jealous like his creator.<sup><xref rid="fn1801">18</xref></sup> Scripture tells us that God is <italic>a jealous God</italic> (Ex. 20:5) when it comes to idolatry.</p>
<p>[SO THAT I CONSUMED NOT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL IN MY JEALOUSY.] If Phinehas had not been jealous for My sake, then I would have destroyed all of Israel in My jealousy.</p>
<p>12. MY COVENANT OF PEACE. The meaning of <italic>beriti shalom</italic> (My covenant of peace) is:<sup><xref rid="fn1802">19</xref></sup> My covenant, a covenant of peace.<sup><xref rid="fn1803">20</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Thy throne God</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1804">21</xref></sup> (Ps. 45:7).<sup><xref rid="fn1805">22</xref></sup> There are many such cases.<sup><xref rid="fn1806">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Its meaning is that Phinehas should not fear the brothers of Zimri for Zimri<sup><xref rid="fn1807">24</xref></sup> was a prince of a father&#x2019;s house (v. 14).</p>
<p>Phinehas was rewarded with the covenant of priesthood for himself and his seed forever, for all the high priests were descendants of Phinehas. It is possible that Eleazar<sup><xref rid="fn1808">25</xref></sup> had other sons.<sup><xref rid="fn1809">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>acharav</italic> (after him) (v. 13)<sup><xref rid="fn1810">27</xref></sup> is proof that Phinehas died and is in no way to be identified with Elijah.<sup><xref rid="fn1811">28</xref></sup> I have already explained it.<sup><xref rid="fn1812">29</xref></sup> Phinehas <italic>was ruler over them</italic> [Israel] (I Chron. 9:20). He was alive during the incident of the concubine from Gibeah.<sup><xref rid="fn1813">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. BECAUSE HE WAS JEALOUS FOR HIS GOD. He acted out of his love for God. He also did good for Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1814">31</xref></sup> According to the midrashic interpretation, the father<sup><xref rid="fn1815">32</xref></sup> atoned and the children<sup><xref rid="fn1816">33</xref></sup> will atone.<sup><xref rid="fn1817">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. WHO WAS SLAIN WITH THE MIDIANITISH WOMAN. <italic>Et ha-midyanit</italic> is to be rendered, with the Midianitish woman.<sup><xref rid="fn1818">35</xref></sup> There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn1819">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>A PRINCE OF A FATHER&#x2019;S HOUSE AMONG THE SIMEONITES. One of the five fathers&#x2019; [houses] of the children of Simeon.<sup><xref rid="fn1820">37</xref></sup> The head of his father&#x2019;s house was greater than he.<sup><xref rid="fn1821">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. ZUR. Zur was one of the kings of Midian. Note, each of the five kings of Midian ruled over a house.</p>
<p>17. HARASS. <italic>Tzaror</italic> (harass) is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn1822">39</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>zakhor</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1823">40</xref></sup> (remember) in <italic>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy</italic>.</p>
<p>18. FOR THEY HARASS YOU. <italic>Ki tzorerim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1824">41</xref></sup> <italic>hem lakhem</italic> (for they harass you) is to be rendered: for they harassed you.</p>
<p>BY THEIR WILES. <italic>Be-nikhlehem</italic> (by their wiles) means by their evil thoughts. <italic>Be-nikhlehem</italic> is related to the word <italic>va-yitnakkelu</italic> (they conspired) in <italic>they conspired against him</italic> (Gen. 37:18).<sup><xref rid="fn1825">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND IN THE MATTER OF COZBI. Furthermore, they intend to harm you because of what happened to Cozbi their sister.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1784"><sup>1</sup> In other words, Israel was in Shittim during the incident of Balaam. They did not journey there after the incident.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1785"><sup>2</sup> Until Israel crossed the Jordan and entered Canaan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1786"><sup>3</sup> Our verse reads: <italic>And the people did eat</italic> (va-yokhal), <italic>and bowed down</italic> (va-yishtachavu). <italic>Va-yokhal</italic> is in the singular. <italic>Va-yishtachavu</italic> is in the plural. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1787"><sup>4</sup> Not to the chiefs of the people. The text is vague. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1788"><sup>5</sup> I.E. identifies the chiefs with the judges.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1789"><sup>6</sup> Onkelos renders <italic>u-ketol de-chayyav ketol</italic>: execute those who are guilty of a capital crime. However, I.E.&#x2019;s reference might be to Targum Jonathan, who renders <italic>ve-hiki&#x2019;um, u-tzelovinun</italic> as, and hang them (Krinsky). However, it should also be noted that <italic>u-tzelovinun</italic> can also be rendered, and crucify them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1790"><sup>7</sup> That the reference is to public execution. For they were hung in the mountain so that all in the vicinity could see them executed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1791"><sup>8</sup> The entire clause reads, <italic>and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun</italic>. The next verse continues, <italic>but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1792"><sup>9</sup> Those who worshipped <italic>pe&#x2019;or</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1793"><sup>10</sup> That the judges slew those who worshipped <italic>pe&#x2019;or</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1794"><sup>11</sup> Why did Phinehas kill Zimri? Scripture does not tell us that Zimri worshipped <italic>pe&#x2019;or</italic> (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1795"><sup>12</sup> With Cozbi in the worship of <italic>pe&#x2019;or</italic>.</ftnote>

He also spoke to Eleazar via Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1827">2</xref></sup> <italic>And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1828">3</xref></sup> (Deut. 27:1) and <italic>Then sang Moses and the children of Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1829">4</xref></sup> (Ex. 15:1) are similar.</p>
<p>Scripture states <italic>after the plague</italic> because God said, <italic>Unto these</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1830">5</xref></sup> <italic>the land shall be divided</italic> (v. 53).</p>
<p>3. AND MOSES AND ELEAZAR THE PRIEST SPOKE. In place of his father.<sup><xref rid="fn1831">6</xref></sup> It is possible that Eleazar served as Moses&#x2019; spokesman as Aaron did.<sup><xref rid="fn1832">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH THEM. <italic>Otam</italic> (with them)<sup><xref rid="fn1833">8</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>dabbero</italic> (speak&#x2026;unto him) in <italic>speak peaceably unto him</italic> (Gen. 37:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1834">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD AND UPWARD. This means that they took the sum of the people<sup><xref rid="fn1835">10</xref></sup> as God commanded Moses.</p>
<p>[AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, THAT CAME FORTH OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT.] Scripture states the aforementioned because there were many among those who were numbered who came out of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn1836">11</xref></sup> They most likely came to about half the number of the Israelites. Scripture starts with Reuben in imitation of the manner in which the Israelites<sup><xref rid="fn1837">12</xref></sup> were first numbered in the wilderness of Sinai.</p>
<p>9. WHO STROVE. The word <italic>hitzu</italic> (strove) is similar in meaning to the word <italic>yinnatzu</italic> (strive) in <italic>And if men strive together</italic> (Ex. 21:22).<sup><xref rid="fn1838">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. WITH KORAH. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn1839">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY BECAME A SIGN.<sup><xref rid="fn1840">15</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>that they may be a sign</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1841">16</xref></sup> <italic>unto the children of Israel</italic> (Num. 17:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1842">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. NOTWITHSTANDING THE SONS OF KORAH DIED NOT. Samuel,<sup><xref rid="fn1843">18</xref></sup> his sons, and his grandsons who were singers<sup><xref rid="fn1844">19</xref></sup> and were called the Korahites<sup><xref rid="fn1845">20</xref></sup> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1846">21</xref></sup> The Book of Psalms states, <italic>For the leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah</italic> (Ps. 49:1). The Torah also records the family of the Korahites (v. 58).</p>
<p>Scripture mentions the sons of Korah with the sons of Reuben because the adult and the minor sons of Dathan and Abiram died. The wickedness of Dathan and Abiram was thus greater than the wickedness of Korah.<sup><xref rid="fn1847">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THE JAMINITES. Do not seek grammatical consistency in names. Compare, <italic>puvvah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1848">23</xref></sup> and <italic>puni</italic> (Punites) (v. 23).<sup><xref rid="fn1849">24</xref></sup> From <italic>shefufam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1850">25</xref></sup> Scripture derives <italic>shufami</italic> (v. 39).<sup><xref rid="fn1851">26</xref></sup> Scripture also reads: <italic>of yimnah</italic> (Imnah), <italic>the family of yimnah</italic> (v. 44), not <italic>ha-yemini</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1852">27</xref></sup> as it does in the case of <italic>bri&#x2019;ah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1853">28</xref></sup> and <italic>beri&#x2019;iy</italic> (Beriites)<sup><xref rid="fn1854">29</xref></sup> (v. 44); <italic>Chaggi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1855">30</xref></sup> and <italic>shuni</italic> (v. 15) lacking the <italic>yod</italic> gentile.<sup><xref rid="fn1856">31</xref></sup> On the other hand, the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>chaggi</italic> and <italic>shuni</italic> might be the <italic>yod</italic> gentile and the <italic>yod</italic> of the proper name<sup><xref rid="fn1857">32</xref></sup> is missing. The latter is correct.</p>
<p>After Reuben, Scripture lists Simeon and Gad, who pitched next to Reuben.<sup><xref rid="fn1858">33</xref></sup> However, Manasseh is mentioned before Ephraim.<sup><xref rid="fn1859">34</xref></sup> The order is reversed in the wilderness of Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn1860">35</xref></sup> It appears that this is due to their number, for the sons of Ephraim were more numerous than the sons of Manasseh in the wilderness of Sinai by eight thousand and three hundred,<sup><xref rid="fn1861">36</xref></sup> and in the plains of Moab the sons of Manasseh numbered more than the sons of Ephraim by twenty thousand and two hundred.<sup><xref rid="fn1862">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>No mention is made of the family of the following five sons of Benjamin: Becher, Gera, Naaman, Rosh, and Ard.<sup><xref rid="fn1863">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. OF AHIRAM.<sup><xref rid="fn1864">39</xref></sup> Ahiram<sup><xref rid="fn1865">40</xref></sup> is the same as Ehi.<sup><xref rid="fn1866">41</xref></sup> Shephupham<sup><xref rid="fn1867">42</xref></sup> is the same as Muppim,<sup><xref rid="fn1868">43</xref></sup> and Hupham<sup><xref rid="fn1869">44</xref></sup> is the same as Huppim.<sup><xref rid="fn1870">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Ard and Naaman mentioned in our verse are the sons of Bela.<sup><xref rid="fn1871">46</xref></sup> Others say that Naaman and Ard<sup><xref rid="fn1872">47</xref></sup> were among those who descended to Egypt and that they are the sons of Bela the son of Benjamin.<sup><xref rid="fn1873">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>[42.] OF SHUHAM. He is the same as Hushim.<sup><xref rid="fn1874">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>THESE ARE THE FAMILIES OF DAN AFTER THEIR FAMILIES. For <italic>hushim</italic> was divided into many families.<sup><xref rid="fn1875">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>55. THE LAND SHALL BE DIVIDED. It means that the land shall be divided among the tribes by lot.</p>
<p>[56.] ACCORDING TO THE LOT SHALL THEIR INHERITANCE BE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE MORE AND THE FEWER. To those who were numbered.<sup><xref rid="fn1876">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>57. OF GERSHON. Scripture opens with the first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn1877">52</xref></sup> It mentions Gershon&#x2019;s son Libni. It does not mention Shimei.<sup><xref rid="fn1878">53</xref></sup> It is possible that he had no children. On the other hand, Shimei might have had children and they died childless.</p>
<p>Scripture then mentions the children of Hebron the son of Kohath.<sup><xref rid="fn1879">54</xref></sup> It does not name Uzziel.<sup><xref rid="fn1880">55</xref></sup> It then mentions the sons of Merari<sup><xref rid="fn1881">56</xref></sup> and goes back and refers to the sons of Itzhar.<sup><xref rid="fn1882">57</xref></sup> Then it mentions the sons of Amram.<sup><xref rid="fn1883">58</xref></sup> Scripture places them last<sup><xref rid="fn1884">59</xref></sup> because it goes on to explain what happened to the grandsons of Amram.<sup><xref rid="fn1885">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>58. THE KORAHITES. They are the sons of Korah.<sup><xref rid="fn1886">61</xref></sup> Scripture mentions Jochebed out of respect to her sons. It does not speak of her mother, because Scripture is being brief.<sup><xref rid="fn1887">62</xref></sup> <italic>Asriel, whom she bore</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1888">63</xref></sup> (I Chron. 7:14) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1889">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>62. AND THEY THAT WERE NUMBERED. The Levites. The Levites increased by seven hundred in this numbering.<sup><xref rid="fn1890">65</xref></sup> It is amazing that the Levites increased by only seven hundred. Look&#x0021; The Israelites from among whom all those above the age of twenty died<sup><xref rid="fn1891">66</xref></sup> numbered about the same as they did during their first numbering.<sup><xref rid="fn1892">67</xref></sup> [The small increase in the number of Levites is strange] for the Levites were not included in the numbering of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1893">68</xref></sup> Eleazar the Kohen proves the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn1894">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>64. BUT AMONG THESE THERE WAS NOT A MAN. This verse refers to the number of the children of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1895">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>65. SAVE CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH. Caleb is mentioned before Joshua,<sup><xref rid="fn1896">71</xref></sup> following God&#x2019;s word.<sup><xref rid="fn1897">72</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1826"><sup>1</sup> This line concludes chapter 25, verse 19, and continues into chapter 26, verse 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1827"><sup>2</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation of: <italic>That the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest&#x2026;</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1828"><sup>3</sup> Its meaning is: Moses commanded the elders, who then commanded Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1829"><sup>4</sup> Its meaning is: Moses taught the song to the Israelites. See I.E. on Ex. 15:1 (Vol. 2, p. 291).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1830"><sup>5</sup> Those who survived the plague.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1831"><sup>6</sup> Now that Aaron was dead, Eleazar spoke God&#x2019;s word to the people.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1832"><sup>7</sup> He not only served as spokesman in this case but did so in all other cases.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1833"><sup>8</sup> <italic>Otam</italic> means them. Scripture should have read <italic>ittam</italic> (with them). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1834"><sup>9</sup> <italic>Dabbero</italic> is irregular, for it is a compound of <italic>dabber</italic> (speak) and <italic>oto</italic> (him). <italic>Dabbero</italic> literally means speak him. We thus sees that Scripture employs the term &#x201C;him&#x201D; with the meaning of &#x201C;with him.&#x201D; The same applies to the term <italic>otam</italic> (them). Scripture occasionally employs it with the meaning of &#x201C;with them.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1835"><sup>10</sup> In other words, <italic>From twenty years old and upward</italic> is short for: they took up the sum of the people from twenty years old and up.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1836"><sup>11</sup> Those who were under the age of twenty when they left Egypt did not die in the wilderness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1837"><sup>12</sup> See Num. 1:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1838"><sup>13</sup> In other words, <italic>hitzu</italic> means strove.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1841"><sup>16</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ot</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1842"><sup>17</sup> In other words, <italic>nes</italic> here means a sign. The word <italic>nes</italic> can mean banner or miracle. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1844"><sup>19</sup> In the temple.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1845"><sup>20</sup> See I Chron. 6:18-23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1846"><sup>21</sup> That Korah&#x2019;s children did not die.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1847"><sup>22</sup> Hence their children died. When Moses asked Dathan and Abiram to come to him, they refused and insulted Moses. We do not find the same with Korah (Num. 16:12-14).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1848"><sup>23</sup> Puvvah the son of Issachar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1849"><sup>24</sup> We would expect <italic>puvvi</italic> rather than <italic>puni</italic> to be used for a member of Puvvah&#x2019;s family.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1850"><sup>25</sup> The son of Benjamin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1851"><sup>26</sup> As the term for a member of his family. However, we would expect the term <italic>shefufami</italic> to be used.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1852"><sup>27</sup> Which is the correct grammatical form for a member of the family of <italic>yimnah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1853"><sup>28</sup> The son of Asher.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1854"><sup>29</sup> The family of Beriah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1855"><sup>30</sup> <italic>Chaggi</italic> and <italic>shuni</italic> were sons of Gad. Scripture refers to members of their family by the terms <italic>chaggi</italic> and <italic>shuni</italic> rather than <italic>chaggi&#x2019;iy</italic> or <italic>shuni&#x2019;iy</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1856"><sup>31</sup> These terms are thus irregular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1857"><sup>32</sup> The <italic>yod</italic> of the names of <italic>chaggi</italic> and <italic>shuni</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1858"><sup>33</sup> And similarly the other tribes. In other words, Scripture does not list the tribes in the order of their births but by their banners. See Num. 10:11-28.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1860"><sup>35</sup> In Num. 1:32-35.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1862"><sup>37</sup> Hence they were mentioned first. See verses 34 and 37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1863"><sup>38</sup> See Gen. 46:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1864"><sup>39</sup> There is a discrepancy between the sons of Benjamin as given in verses 38-40 and those given in Gen. 46:21. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1865"><sup>40</sup> In our verse.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1872"><sup>47</sup> Mentioned in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1873"><sup>48</sup> In other words, they and the Naaman and Ard mentioned in Genesis are one and the same. However, Scripture omitted their father&#x2019;s name in Genesis.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1874"><sup>49</sup> Mentioned in Gen. 46:23. There is thus no discrepancy in the names of the son of Dan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1875"><sup>50</sup> Hence <italic>the family of the Shuhamites</italic> follows <italic>of Shuham</italic> (also called Hushim).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1881"><sup>56</sup> <italic>The family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites</italic>. Mahli and Mushi were sons of Merari. See Ex. 6:19.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1887"><sup>62</sup> Our verse literally reads: And the name of Amram&#x2019;s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom she bore. Scripture does not identify the one who did the bearing, i.e., Jochebed&#x2019;s mother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1888"><sup>63</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1889"><sup>64</sup> Here too Scripture omits the subject.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1890"><sup>65</sup>The first time the Levites were counted they numbered 22,300. See Num. 3:39 along with I.E.&#x2019;s comment on it. Their number here is given as 23,000. The Levites thus increased by 700 in close to 40 years.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 27</title>
<p>3. AND HE WAS NOT AMONG THE COMPANY. The daughters<sup><xref rid="fn1898">1</xref></sup> thought that the children of those who gathered themselves together against the Lord<sup><xref rid="fn1899">2</xref></sup> would not inherit.<sup><xref rid="fn1900">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT HE DIED IN HIS OWN SIN. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi the Spaniard says <italic>but he died in his own sin</italic> is to be understood as connected to <italic>and he had no sons</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1901">4</xref></sup> It is as we say today, such and such occurred to so and so because of his sins. This interpretation is not far off.</p>
<p>4. BECAUSE HE HAD NO SON. <italic>Ki en lo ben</italic> is to be rendered, because he had no son.<sup><xref rid="fn1902">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. RIGHT. <italic>Ken</italic> means true.<sup><xref rid="fn1903">6</xref></sup> Or, the thing is so.<sup><xref rid="fn1904">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THOU SHALT CAUSE THE INHERITANCE. What he should have received, they shall receive.</p>
<p>8. AND HAVE NO SON. This is proof that a son inherits his father&#x2019;s property.</p>
<p>9. UNTO HIS BRETHREN. From his father or mother.</p>
<p>[11.] UNTO HIS KINSMAN THAT IS NEXT TO HIM. From all of his family.<sup><xref rid="fn1905">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE SHALL POSSESS IT. The inheritance. I have already explained the approach of the rabbis in my comments on <italic>unto a foreign people</italic> (Ex. 21:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1906">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>We need rabbinic tradition to know the laws of inheritance with regard to whether a father or a mother inherits a son&#x2019;s property or what a woman inherits.</p>
<p>The rabbis of blessed memory said that the chapter that opens with the words, <italic>Get thee up into this mountain</italic> (v. 12), follows the laws of inheritance because Moses wanted to know who would inherit his position.</p>
<p>14. TO SANCTIFY ME. The word <italic>le-hakdesheni</italic> (to sanctify me) is connected to <italic>meritem</italic> (ye rebelled).<sup><xref rid="fn1907">10</xref></sup> Its meaning is, ye rebelled with regard to sanctifying me.<sup><xref rid="fn1908">11</xref></sup> This, I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn1909">12</xref></sup> is the meaning of <italic>because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel</italic> (Deut. 32:51).</p>
<p>16. THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS. He knows the spirits. He knows which spirit is fit.<sup><xref rid="fn1910">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>[SET.] The word <italic>yifkod</italic> (set) is related to the word <italic>pakid</italic> (official).<sup><xref rid="fn1911">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. WHO MAY GO OUT BEFORE THEM. In war.</p>
<p>WHO MAY LEAD THEM OUT. <italic>Va-asher yotzi&#x2019;em</italic> (who may lead them out) means who will direct someone else to lead them out.<sup><xref rid="fn1912">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. IN WHOM IS SPIRIT. Now all living persons have spirit in them.<sup><xref rid="fn1913">16</xref></sup> Its meaning can only be similar to that of <italic>be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man</italic> (I Kings 2:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1914">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND LAY THY HAND UPON HIM. To show Israel that he was in Moses&#x2019; place and that he<sup><xref rid="fn1915">18</xref></sup> was the one on whom Moses had placed his hands.</p>
<p>20. AND THOU SHALT PUT OF THY HONOR UPON HIM. You will honor Joshua in front of all of Israel.</p>
<p>THAT&#x2026;MAY HEARKEN. For Israel already believes in you. When they see that you honored Joshua they will respect him, for they will follow your ways.</p>
<p>21. AT HIS WORD SHALL THEY GO OUT. Upon the word of Eleazar by the judgment of the Urim.<sup><xref rid="fn1916">19</xref></sup> Others say, in accordance to the judgment of the Urim.<sup><xref rid="fn1917">20</xref></sup> The first interpretation appears correct to me.</p>
<p>BOTH HE, AND ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. In regard to that which pertains to all.</p>
<p>EVEN ALL THE CONGREGATION. They gathered in the tent of meeting concerning a matter that pertained to the congregation.</p>
<p>The reason the chapter dealing with the sacrifices follows<sup><xref rid="fn1918">21</xref></sup> is that God then<sup><xref rid="fn1919">22</xref></sup> ordered Moses to command the children of Israel regarding the sacrifices they are obligated to offer,<sup><xref rid="fn1920">23</xref></sup> for Moses was not to enter the land with them.</p>
<p>Scripture starts with the daily burnt offering even though it was mentioned earlier.<sup><xref rid="fn1921">24</xref></sup> It is possible that the earlier burnt offering was the one offered at Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn1922">25</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is possible that Scripture wants to insure that the arrangement of the sacrifices is in order.<sup><xref rid="fn1923">26</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1898"><sup>1</sup> Of Zelophehad.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1899"><sup>2</sup> In the company of Korah (Num. 16:1-19).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1900"><sup>3</sup> Hence they said that their father was not in Korah&#x2019;s company.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1901"><sup>4</sup> In other words, the meaning here is: he died without sons because of his sins.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1902"><sup>5</sup> In other words, the meaning of <italic>ki</italic> in our verse is because. <italic>Ki</italic> has a number of meanings. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1903"><sup>6</sup> According to this interpretation our clause reads: The daughters of Zelophehad speak the truth (<italic>ken</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1904"><sup>7</sup> According this interpretation our clause reads: The facts are (<italic>ken</italic>) as the daughters of Zelophehad speak.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1905"><sup>8</sup> That is closest to the deceased.</ftnote>

<p>2. MY FOOD. I have previously explained the meaning of the term <italic>lechem</italic> (food).<sup><xref rid="fn1924">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>MADE BY FIRE. I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>le-ishai</italic> (made by fire).<sup><xref rid="fn1925">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>lachmi le-ishai re&#x2019;ach nicho&#x2019;ach</italic> (My food&#x2026;made by fire, of a sweet savour unto Me) is, food for my fire, for a sweet savour unto Me.</p>
<p>IN ITS DUE SEASON. It shall not be bought before the morning, nor delayed after evening.</p>
<p>4. THE ONE LAMB. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen the Spaniard says that our verse is abridged. It should be read as if written <italic>ha-keves, keves echad</italic> (the lamb, one lamb).<sup><xref rid="fn1926">3</xref></sup> However, I believe that the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>keves</italic> is to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn1927">4</xref></sup> I have already shown you many such cases.<sup><xref rid="fn1928">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. WHICH WAS OFFERED IN MOUNT SINAI. Its meaning is, as you offered on Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn1929">6</xref></sup> This verse<sup><xref rid="fn1930">7</xref></sup> is an additional proof that Israel did not offer burnt offerings in the wilderness after they journeyed from Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn1931">8</xref></sup> as I previously explained with perfect proof.<sup><xref rid="fn1932">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. SHALT THOU POUR OUT A DRINK-OFFERING OF STRONG DRINK. The stem <italic>nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1933">10</xref></sup> is swallowed by the <italic>samekh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1934">11</xref></sup> We will rely on the words of our sages of blessed memory as to its meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn1935">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. OF EVERY SABBATH. The <italic>vav</italic> suffixed to the word <italic>shabbat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1936">13</xref></sup> refers to the day of Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn1937">14</xref></sup> This is so even though we find the word <italic>me-challelo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1938">15</xref></sup> (from profaning it<sup><xref rid="fn1939">16</xref></sup>) in <italic>Every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it</italic> (Is. 56:6).</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>be-shabbato</italic> (of every Sabbath) is, <italic>every sabbath and sabbath</italic>. Compare, <italic>yom be-yomo</italic> (daily) (Ex. 5:13).</p>
<p>BESIDE THE CONTINUAL BURNT-OFFERING. This means after the continual burnt offering. The Sabbath burnt offering shall follow it.<sup><xref rid="fn1940">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND IN YOUR NEW MOONS. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen the Spaniard, who rests in paradise, says that <italic>u-ve-roshe chodshekhem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1941">18</xref></sup> (and in your new moons) refers to the new moon of Nisan, for Scripture clearly states, <italic>it shall be the first month of the year to you</italic> (Ex. 12:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1942">19</xref></sup> Scripture then goes on to say, <italic>This is the burnt-offering of every new moon</italic> (v. 14), that is, they shall offer this burnt offering<sup><xref rid="fn1943">20</xref></sup> on every new moon. The Torah therefore adds, <italic>throughout the months of the year</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1944">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Moses&#x2019; interpretation is correct. He is right even though the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>u-ve-roshe chodshekhem</italic> (and in your new moons) argues against his interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn1945">22</xref></sup> However, the fact that we find <italic>hinneh chodesh machar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1946">23</xref></sup> (Behold, tomorrow is the new moon) (I Sam. 20:5) shows that what he says is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn1947">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. OF EVERY NEW MOON. <italic>Chodesh be-chodsho</italic> (of every new moon) is similar<sup><xref rid="fn1948">25</xref></sup> to <italic>shabbat be-shabbato</italic> (of every sabbath) (Num. 28 :10).<sup><xref rid="fn1949">26</xref></sup> According to the plain meaning of the text there is no possibility of interpreting it any other way,<sup><xref rid="fn1950">27</xref></sup> for there is no mention of the moon in our verse.<sup><xref rid="fn1951">28</xref></sup> Furthermore, we only find the Hebrew form for the verb new in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>, which has a <italic>dagesh</italic> placed in it.<sup><xref rid="fn1952">29</xref></sup> However, here<sup><xref rid="fn1953">30</xref></sup> the <italic>dalet</italic> has no <italic>dagesh</italic> in it.</p>
<p>15. AND ONE HE-GOAT FOR A SIN-OFFERING UNTO THE LORD. Compare, <italic>upon which the lot fell for the Lord, and offer him for a sin-offering</italic> (Lev. 16:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1954">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note, in Hebrew the sin is connected to the sinner whenever the word <italic>chattat</italic> is followed by a <italic>lamed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1955">32</xref></sup> Can&#x2019;t you see that Scripture reads, <italic>ve-chatati le-avi</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1956">33</xref></sup> (I shall bear the blame to my father) (Gen. 44:32). Look, this is contrary to the midrashic interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn1957">34</xref></sup> However, the midrashic interpretation has a secret meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn1958">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH. Scripture does not mention at dusk.<sup><xref rid="fn1959">36</xref></sup> This verse is also a support for those who transmit tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn1960">37</xref></sup> even though their words need no support.</p>
<p>22. AND ONE HE-GOAT FOR A SIN-OFFERING. <italic>U-se&#x2019;ir chattat echad</italic> (and he-goat for a sin-offering) is the same as <italic>u-se&#x2019;ir izzim echad le-chattat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1961">38</xref></sup> (and one he-goat for a sin-offering). Our verse is abridged.<sup><xref rid="fn1962">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observe, Scripture does not mention the Sabbath burnt offering<sup><xref rid="fn1963">40</xref></sup> which is to be brought during the seven days of Passover. It similarly omits<sup><xref rid="fn1964">41</xref></sup> the burnt offering which accompanied the waved sheaf.<sup><xref rid="fn1965">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>We need tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1966">43</xref></sup> For the verse (v. 10) tells us that [the burnt offering] <italic>of every sabbath</italic> shall follow the daily burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1967">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. WHEN YE BRING A NEW MEAL-OFFERING UNTO THE LORD. The two waveloaves<sup><xref rid="fn1968">45</xref></sup> were the main offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn1969">46</xref></sup> The seven lambs, one young bullock, two rams and two lambs of peace offering<sup><xref rid="fn1970">47</xref></sup> were brought along with it. The burnt offering mentioned in our chapter<sup><xref rid="fn1971">48</xref></sup> refers to the obligatory sacrifice of the festival day.<sup><xref rid="fn1972">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fact that Scripture does not state<sup><xref rid="fn1973">50</xref></sup> anything at all<sup><xref rid="fn1974">51</xref></sup> about the Sabbath and festivals, but only mentions <italic>And ye shall bring an offering made by fire</italic> without telling us the number of sacrificial animals for the festival of unleavened bread (Lev. 23:8), and Sukkot (Lev. 23:36), and the holiday celebrated on the tenth day of Tishri (Lev. 23:27) is proof of the words of our sages.<sup><xref rid="fn1975">52</xref></sup> The same is true for the day of the shofar sounding.<sup><xref rid="fn1976">53</xref></sup> Scripture does not mention the new moon burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1977">54</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>And the continual burnt-offering and the meal-offering thereof</italic> (Num. 29:6) refers to the first burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1978">55</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1924"><sup>1</sup> In his comments on Ex. 16:4, I.E. explains that the term <italic>lechem</italic> can refer to bread, meat, or fruit. See I.E. on Ex. 16:4 (Vol. 2, p. 316).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1925"><sup>2</sup> According to I.E. the word <italic>isheh</italic> means a burnt offering. Thus <italic>le-ishai</italic> means for my burnt offerings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1926"><sup>3</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>et ha-keves echad</italic> (the one lamb). A word with the direct object prefixed to it cannot be in the construct. Our verse reads, the lamb one in the morning. This is incorrect syntax. Hence Rabbi Moses&#x2019; interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1927"><sup>4</sup> Our verse is to be read as if written, <italic>et ha-keves, keves echad ba-boker</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1928"><sup>5</sup> Where a letter is to be read as if written twice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1929"><sup>6</sup> In other words, they were not to bring the very same offering which they had brought at Sinai, for that offering no longer existed. They were to bring a similar offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1930"><sup>7</sup> In addition to Ex. 29:42. See I.E. on Ex. 29:42 (Vol. 2, p. 620).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1931"><sup>8</sup> Our verse speaks of the burnt offering at Sinai. It does not speak of the one offered in the wilderness. This implies that no burnt offering was offered in the wilderness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1932"><sup>9</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 29:42.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1933"><sup>10</sup> Of the root <italic>nun, samekh, caf</italic>, the root of <italic>hassekh</italic> (shalt thou pour out).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1934"><sup>11</sup> In the word <italic>hassekh</italic> (shalt thou pour out). Hence the <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>samekh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1935"><sup>12</sup> We will rely on the sages concerning what Scripture means by the term <italic>nesekh</italic> (strong drink). According to the sages it refers to undiluted wine. In ancient times wine for drinking was mixed with water.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1936"><sup>13</sup> The reference is to the <italic>vav</italic> in the word <italic>shabbato</italic> (every Sabbath).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1937"><sup>14</sup> <italic>Shabbat</italic> is feminine. Thus Scripture should have used the term <italic>shabbatah</italic> if the reference was to every Sabbath. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that the <italic>vav</italic> refers to the word <italic>yom</italic> in verse 9, which is masculine. Thus according to I.E. we should render <italic>shabbato</italic> (every Sabbath) as every Sabbath day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1938"><sup>15</sup> Rather than <italic>mechallelah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1939"><sup>16</sup> The reference is to the Sabbath. We thus see that Scripture treats <italic>shabbat</italic> as masculine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1940"><sup>17</sup> Literally, he shall place the Sabbath burnt offering upon it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1941"><sup>18</sup> Literally, and in the first of your months. Hence Rabbi Moses&#x2019; interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1942"><sup>19</sup> Hence the first of your months (see previous note) refers to the first month of the year, i.e., the new moon of Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1943"><sup>20</sup> The same burnt offering that was offered on the new moon of Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1944"><sup>21</sup> A similar burnt offering shall be offered on the new moons throughout the year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1945"><sup>22</sup> <italic>Roshe</italic> is a plural. Hence <italic>roshe chodshekhem</italic> seems to mean the many first days of the month. If the reference was to the new moon of Nisan, then Scripture should have read <italic>u-ve-rosh chodshekem</italic> (and on the first day of your months).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1946"><sup>23</sup> Not <italic>hinneh rosh chodesh machar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1947"><sup>24</sup> The Book of Samuel refers to the new moon as <italic>chodesh</italic>. This implies that an ordinary new moon is called <italic>chodesh</italic>, and the new moon of Nisan <italic>rosh chodesh</italic>. Otherwise Samuel would have referred to the new moon by the phrase <italic>rosh chodesh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1948"><sup>25</sup> In meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1949"><sup>26</sup> In other words, the meaning of <italic>chodesh be-chodsho</italic> is every new moon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1950"><sup>27</sup> Some interpreted <italic>chodesh be-chodsho</italic> to mean when it (the moon) renews itself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1951"><sup>28</sup> If we take <italic>chodesh</italic> to mean new and <italic>chodesh be-chodsho</italic> to mean as when it renews itself, then the subject (the word moon) is missing from the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1952"><sup>29</sup> In other words, if our text intended to say &#x201C;when it renews itself&#x201D; the text would have read, <italic>chodesh be-chiddusho</italic>, not <italic>chodesh be-chodsho</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1953"><sup>30</sup> In <italic>chodesh be-chodsho</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1954"><sup>31</sup> Our verse literally reads for a &#x201C;sin&#x201D; unto the Lord. Lev. 16:9 teaches us that in our context &#x201C;sin&#x201D; stands for, a sin offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1955"><sup>32</sup> The <italic>lamed</italic> prefaced to a word sometimes means of. Compare, <italic>mizmor le-david</italic> (a psalm of David). Thus the phrase <italic>chattat la-Adonai</italic> might be taken to mean a sin of God. Therefore I.E. points out that its meaning is, an offering to God to atone for a sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1956"><sup>33</sup> <italic>Ve-chatati le-avi</italic> literally means I will sin to my father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1957"><sup>34</sup> According to the midrash, <italic>le-chattat la-Adonai</italic> (for a sin-offering unto the Lord), which literally states, for a sin offering for the Lord, means that the sin offering is offered on behalf of God for diminishing the size of the moon. See <italic>Shavu&#x2019;ot</italic> 9a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1958"><sup>35</sup> I.E. does not give us its secret meaning. However, in his <italic>Yesod Ha-Ibbur</italic> he indicates that the sin offering is to avert the unfavorable consequences which come about when the moon is full. See Meijler on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1959"><sup>36</sup> As it does in Ex. 12:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1960"><sup>37</sup> According to the rabbis the paschal lamb could be offered after midday, at the moment the sun moves to the west. See I.E. on Ex. 12:6 (Vol. 2, p. 221).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1961"><sup>38</sup> This is the phrase normally used for a he-goat offering. See verses 15 and 30 in our chapter and verses 5, 11, 16, and 25 in chapter 29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1962"><sup>39</sup> <italic>Se&#x2019;ir</italic> is short for <italic>se&#x2019;ir izzim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1963"><sup>40</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. Also see Krinsky and Meijler. The printed texts omit the word Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1964"><sup>41</sup> From the Passover offerings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1965"><sup>42</sup> On the second day of Passover. See Lev. 23:9-14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1966"><sup>43</sup> As to when the Sabbath offering is to be brought on a Sabbath during the week of Passover (Meijler).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1967"><sup>44</sup> The question arises, when is the Sabbath offering to be offered on a Sabbath which falls during the week of Passover? Is it to be before or after the additional Passover offerings? According to tradition, the Sabbath offering came before the Passover offerings.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 30</title>
<h1>MATTOT</h1>
<p>2. UNTO THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES. I believe that this section<sup><xref rid="fn1996">1</xref></sup> followed the war with Midian.<sup><xref rid="fn1997">2</xref></sup> The Midianite war<sup><xref rid="fn1998">3</xref></sup> therefore comes after it.<sup><xref rid="fn1999">4</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses</italic> (Num. 12:1), which comes after <italic>and they abode in Hazeroth</italic> (Num. 11:35)<sup><xref rid="fn2000">5</xref></sup> as I explained.</p>
<p>Scripture tells us that the children of Gad came to Moses and Eleazar and the princes of the congregation, and spoke their piece (Num. 32:2-6). Scripture then writes, <italic>So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers&#x2019; houses</italic> (Num. 32:28). The <italic>heads of the fathers&#x2019;</italic> houses refers to the already-mentioned princes (Num. 32:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2001">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses told the children of Gad and the children of Reuben, <italic>and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth</italic> (Num. 32:24). Scripture therefore reads,<sup><xref rid="fn2002">7</xref></sup> <italic>And Moses spoke unto the heads of the tribes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2003">8</xref></sup> <italic>saying&#x2026;</italic>(v. 2). <italic>When a man voweth a vow&#x2026;he shall not break his word</italic>. Scripture there<sup><xref rid="fn2004">9</xref></sup> writes, <italic>he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth</italic> (v. 3).</p>
<p>OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. That they should relate this to the children of Israel.</p>
<p>3. UNTO THE LORD. He mentions God&#x2019;s name. He vows as follows: If this comes to pass, then I will give the following sum to God, or I will fast.</p>
<p>SWEARETH. <italic>Hishavah</italic> (sweareth) is an infinitive. It is connected to a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn2005">10</xref></sup> There are many such cases.<sup><xref rid="fn2006">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE SHALL NOT BREAK HIS WORD. <italic>Lo yahel</italic> (he shall not break) means he shall not profane. The word <italic>yahel</italic> is not related to the word <italic>mechilah</italic> (forgiveness).</p>
<p>We need tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn2007">12</xref></sup> for Scripture speaks of a man and a women but does not tell us at what age a person is considered a man or at what age a female is considered a women.<sup><xref rid="fn2008">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND BINDETH HERSELF BY A BOND. Or bindeth herself by a bond.<sup><xref rid="fn2009">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>[5.] HER BOND. <italic>Essarah</italic> (her bond) belongs to a different form.<sup><xref rid="fn2010">15</xref></sup> It is not the same as <italic>issar</italic> (bond).<sup><xref rid="fn2011">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. DISALLOW. The word <italic>heni</italic> (disallow) means broke or nullified. Compare, <italic>tenu&#x2019;ati</italic> (My displeasure) (Num. 14:34).</p>
<p>IN THE DAY THAT HE HEARETH. And not on any other day.</p>
<p>7. WHILE HER VOWS ARE UPON HER. In her father&#x2019;s house. If her father does not nullify her vows, her husband may disallow her vows.</p>
<p>9. HE HEARETH IT. The word from her mouth.</p>
<p>AND THE CLEAR UTTERANCE OF HER LIPS. The oath.</p>
<p>11. AND IF A WOMAN VOWED IN HER HUSBAND&#x2019;S HOUSE. If the widow vowed in an earlier time and her husband disallowed it, then she does not have to keep the vow in her widowhood. This speaks about a vow which she vowed regarding the future, and the husband died before the vow was to take effect.<sup><xref rid="fn2012">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>selichah</italic> (forgiveness) has been previously explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2013">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. TO AFFLICT THE SOUL. Even to afflict the soul. I have already explained that &#x201C;affliction of the soul&#x201D; refers to fasting.<sup><xref rid="fn2014">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. THEN HE CAUSETH ALL HER VOWS TO STAND. He has already caused all of her vows to stand.<sup><xref rid="fn2015">20</xref></sup> Scripture then explains how he caused her vows to stand, namely, because he held his peace in the day that he heard them.</p>
<p>16. THEN HE SHALL BEAR HER INIQUITY. For she is under his care.</p>
<p>17. BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS WIFE. His wife being a woman who is an adult.</p>
<p>BETWEEN A FATHER AND HIS DAUGHTER. If she has not reached adulthood. Hence Scripture reads, <italic>being in her youth</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1996"><sup>1</sup> The section dealing with the laws of vows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1997"><sup>2</sup> Even though it precedes it. The war with Midian is described in chapter 31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1998"><sup>3</sup> Which inspired this chapter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1999"><sup>4</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the laws of vows and the war with Midian are juxtaposed with each other because they occurred at the same time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2000"><sup>5</sup> We thus see that Scripture sometimes puts first that which came after, when that which came later was the cause of that which is described first. For Israel dwelled in Hazeroth because Miriam spoke against Moses (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2001"><sup>6</sup> The heads of the fathers&#x2019; houses are to be identified with the princes mentioned in Num. 32:6, for the princes mentioned in Num. 7 were no longer alive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2002"><sup>7</sup> In our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2003"><sup>8</sup> For they were to see to it that the tribes of Reuben, Gad and half of Manasseh kept their word.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2004"><sup>9</sup> That is, here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2005"><sup>10</sup> When an infinitive is connected to a word, that word is usually a verb. Compare, <italic>ve-rappo yerrape</italic> (and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed) (Ex. 21:19). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2006"><sup>11</sup> Compare, <italic>shefot ha-shofetim</italic> (when the judges judged) (Ruth 1:1).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2007"><sup>12</sup> To ascertain the age at which one is obligated to keep one&#x2019;s vows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2008"><sup>13</sup> And is obligated to keep his or her vows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2009"><sup>14</sup> The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-aserah</italic> means or, not and.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2010"><sup>15</sup> From <italic>issar</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2011"><sup>16</sup> For <italic>issar</italic> has a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>samekh</italic>. In other words, <italic>esar</italic> and <italic>issar</italic> come from the same root but belong to different forms.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2012"><sup>17</sup> Otherwise our verse would be repeating verse 9. For if a husband can annul his wife&#x2019;s vow which was made when she was under her father&#x2019;s charge, he can certainly annul avow made under his charge. Hence I.E. explains that our verse deals with a divorcee or widow who uttered a vow while married and had the vow nullified by her husband, who died before the vow became due. Our verse teaches that in such a case the nullification of the vow retains its efficacy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2013"><sup>18</sup> See I.E. on Num. 14:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2014"><sup>19</sup> See I.E. on Lev. 16:29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2015"><sup>20</sup> In other words, <italic>ve-hekim</italic> means: has already caused, rather than: and he will cause.</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 31</title>
<p>3. ARM YE MEN. The meaning of <italic>hechaletzu</italic> (arm ye men) is, gird your men of war.<sup><xref rid="fn2016">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO EXECUTE THE LORD&#x2019;S VENGEANCE. The reference is to Israel&#x2019;s vengeance<sup><xref rid="fn2017">2</xref></sup> because they were enticed<sup><xref rid="fn2018">3</xref></sup> into worshipping idols.</p>
<p>5. SO WERE DELIVERED. <italic>Va-yimasseru</italic> means and they were delivered. The word <italic>li-mesor</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2019">4</xref></sup> (to deliver) (v. 16) is close in meaning to it.</p>
<p>6. WITH THE HOLY VESSELS. The ark.</p>
<p>7. AND THEY SLEW EVERY MALE. Adult males.<sup><xref rid="fn2020">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND ZUR. The father of Cozbi.<sup><xref rid="fn2021">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>BALAAM ALSO THE SON OF BEOR. Some say that after Balaam returned to his place,<sup><xref rid="fn2022">7</xref></sup> he went back to Midian as soon as he learned of the plague that struck Israel because of his advice. He came back to receive money from the elders of Midian.<sup><xref rid="fn2023">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND ALL THEIR GOODS. The word <italic>chelam</italic> (their goods) is a general term. It refers to gold, silver, copper, iron, and garments.</p>
<p>10. AND ALL THEIR CITIES IN THE PLACES WHEREIN THEY DWELT. An all-inclusive term<sup><xref rid="fn2024">9</xref></sup> followed by a limiting term.<sup><xref rid="fn2025">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ALL THEIR ENCAMPMENTS. <italic>Tirotam</italic> (their encampments) means the palaces of the kings.<sup><xref rid="fn2026">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND THEY TOOK ALL THE SPOIL, AND ALL THE PREY. <italic>Malko&#x2019;ach</italic> (prey) is a general term for men and cattle.</p>
<p>12. THE CAPTIVES. <italic>Shevi</italic> (captive) is a specific term. It refers to humans.</p>
<p>THE SPOIL. <italic>Shalal</italic> (spoil) refers to garments.</p>
<p>14. WITH THE OFFICERS OF THE HOST. The word <italic>pekudai</italic> (officers of) is related to the word <italic>yifkod</italic> (set) in <italic>Let the Lord&#x2026;set</italic> (Num. 27 :16).<sup><xref rid="fn2027">12</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn2028">13</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>pekide he-chayil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2029">14</xref></sup> Similarly, the word <italic>keru&#x2019;e</italic> (the elect of) (Num. 1:16) means the same as <italic>keri&#x2019;e</italic> (the elect of) (Num. 16:2).</p>
<p>THE CAPTAINS OF THOUSANDS AND THE CAPTAINS OF HUNDREDS. They totaled one hundred and thirty-two.<sup><xref rid="fn2030">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. HAVE YE SAVED ALL THE WOMEN ALIVE. The meaning of <italic>kol nekevah</italic> (all the women) is, even one woman.<sup><xref rid="fn2031">16</xref></sup> <italic>En kol</italic> (had nothing)<sup><xref rid="fn2032">17</xref></sup> (II Sam. 12:3)<sup><xref rid="fn2033">18</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>It is also possible that <italic>have ye saved all the women alive</italic> is to be taken literally, for they kept all the females alive. There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2034">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THE LITTLE ONES. <italic>Taf</italic> (little ones) is a general term for male and female minors.</p>
<p>19. YE AND YOUR CAPTIVES.<sup><xref rid="fn2035">20</xref></sup> Because of the glory which dwells among you.</p>
<p>20. AND ALL WORK OF GOATS&#x2019; HAIR.<sup><xref rid="fn2036">21</xref></sup> This is to be interpreted in accordance with my earlier explanation.<sup><xref rid="fn2037">22</xref></sup> Observe, the garment<sup><xref rid="fn2038">23</xref></sup> is unclean because it touched a corpse. The meaning of our verse is, the garments shall be with you<sup><xref rid="fn2039">24</xref></sup> until you are purified.<sup><xref rid="fn2040">25</xref></sup> On the other hand, <italic>titchate&#x2019;u</italic> (ye shall purify) might be transitive.<sup><xref rid="fn2041">26</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-hitavvitem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2042">27</xref></sup> <italic>lakhem</italic> (and ye shall mark out) (Num. 34:10) is similar,<sup><xref rid="fn2043">28</xref></sup> for <italic>gevul</italic> (line)<sup><xref rid="fn2044">29</xref></sup> is the object.<sup><xref rid="fn2045">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND ELEAZAR THE PRIEST SAID. For the law regarding the cow<sup><xref rid="fn2046">31</xref></sup> was given to Eleazar.<sup><xref rid="fn2047">32</xref></sup> Moses told the people in a general manner, <italic>ye shall purify</italic> (v. 20). However, Eleazar explained it to them.<sup><xref rid="fn2048">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. THE TIN. The meaning of the <italic>bedil</italic> (tin) is known.<sup><xref rid="fn2049">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. NEVERTHELESS IT SHALL BE PURIFIED WITH THE WATER OF SPRINKLING.<sup><xref rid="fn2050">35</xref></sup> It would have appeared to us that the reference is to the mixture of the water and tahe ashes of the cow,<sup><xref rid="fn2051">36</xref></sup> as in <italic>because the water of sprinkling</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2052">37</xref></sup> <italic>was not dashed against him</italic> (Num. 19:13). However, our wise men of blessed memory say that its meaning is, in the amount of water in which a menstruant bathes.<sup><xref rid="fn2053">38</xref></sup> Their mind is much greater than our minds.</p>
<p>26. TAKE THE SUM. I have already explained the meaning of <italic>sa et rosh</italic> (take the sum).<sup><xref rid="fn2054">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF THE PREY. <italic>Malko&#x2019;ach</italic> (the prey) refers to the cattle.</p>
<p>THAT WAS TAKEN. <italic>Ha-shevi</italic> (that was taken) refers to humans. A <italic>vav</italic> is missing,<sup><xref rid="fn2055">40</xref></sup> as in <italic>shemesh yare&#x2019;ach</italic> (sun moon)<sup><xref rid="fn2056">41</xref></sup> (Hab. 3:11).</p>
<p>AND THE HEADS OF THE FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSES OF THE CONGREGATION. The reference is to the princes.<sup><xref rid="fn2057">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND DIVIDE THE PREY. <italic>Malko&#x2019;ach</italic> (prey) is a general term.<sup><xref rid="fn2058">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. ONE SOUL. <italic>Echad nefesh</italic> means the same as <italic>nefesh echad</italic> (one soul).<sup><xref rid="fn2059">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. ONE DRAWN. <italic>Achuz</italic> (drawn) is similar to <italic>ve-ha&#x2019;achuz achuz</italic> (and proportionally) (I Chron. 24:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2060">45</xref></sup> As I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn2061">46</xref></sup> they are connected.<sup><xref rid="fn2062">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVEN OF ALL THE CATTLE. Camels.<sup><xref rid="fn2063">48</xref></sup> Look, Eleazar did not take a portion from them.<sup><xref rid="fn2064">49</xref></sup> Perhaps they were few. Hence neither the number which they brought nor the amount which the Levites took is mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn2065">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. OVER AND ABOVE THE BOOTY.<sup><xref rid="fn2066">51</xref></sup> Aside from what they consumed. Scripture therefore reads <italic>yeter</italic> (above).<sup><xref rid="fn2067">52</xref></sup> The Torah mentions the amount of spoil because it consisted of a vast number. We never heard of a similar amount of spoil.<sup><xref rid="fn2068">53</xref></sup> Scripture also mentions the tribute,<sup><xref rid="fn2069">54</xref></sup> for it too was very great.</p>
<p>The word <italic>mekhes</italic> (tribute) (v. 37) comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn2070">55</xref></sup> It is vocalized like the word <italic>memer</italic> (bitterness)<sup><xref rid="fn2071">56</xref></sup> in <italic>and bitterness to her that bore him</italic> (Prov. 17:25). <italic>Mekhes</italic> is related to the word <italic>takhossu</italic> (ye shall make your count) in <italic>ye shall make your count for the lamb</italic> (Ex. 12:4). The meaning of <italic>mekhes</italic> (tribute) is a portion.</p>
<p>47. [BOTH OF MAN AND OF BEAST.] Scripture states <italic>both of man and of beast</italic>. Man<sup><xref rid="fn2072">57</xref></sup> and beast<sup><xref rid="fn2073">58</xref></sup> are general terms.</p>
<p>48. THE OFFICERS<sup><xref rid="fn2074">59</xref></sup>. I have already explained this term.<sup><xref rid="fn2075">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>49. THAT ARE UNDER OUR CHARGE. <italic>Asher be-yadenu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2076">61</xref></sup> means that they were in their<sup><xref rid="fn2077">62</xref></sup> charge. Compare, <italic>yadekh</italic> (in your hands) in <italic>And take with thee ten loaves</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2078">63</xref></sup> <italic>in your hands</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2079">64</xref></sup> (I Kings 14:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2080">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>50. AND WE HAVE BROUGHT. In thought or by mouth.<sup><xref rid="fn2081">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>ARMLETS. <italic>Etzadah</italic> (armlet) is an ornament placed on the arm. This is explicitly stated in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2082">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BRACELETS. A <italic>tzamid</italic> (bracelet) is an ornament placed on the wrist.<sup><xref rid="fn2083">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>SIGNET-RINGS. <italic>Taba&#x2019;at</italic> (signet ring) refers to an ornament placed on the finger.<sup><xref rid="fn2084">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>EAR-RINGS. <italic>Agil</italic> is an earring. This is clearly stated in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2085">70</xref></sup> This ornament is possibly so called because it is round (<italic>agul</italic>).</p>
<p>GIRDLES. <italic>Kumaz</italic> (girdles) is similar to its neighboring objects.<sup><xref rid="fn2086">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>51. EVEN ALL THE WROUGHT JEWELS.<sup><xref rid="fn2087">72</xref></sup> Scripture tells us that there was no broken object among them.</p>
<p>53. FOR THE MEN OF WAR HAD TAKEN BOOTY, EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. Scripture mentions this to inform us that each one of the men of war took a vast amount of gold and wrought articles.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2016"><sup>1</sup> Gird a sword upon your men of war (Krinsky). Or, gird the loins of your men of war. <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads gird your loins. See Job 38:3 and Is. 5:27.

<title>CHAPTER 32</title>
<p>1. THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN. For he was the son of the mistress.<sup><xref rid="fn2088">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>WAS A PLACE FOR CATTLE. For there it was good pasture.</p>
<p>2. THE CHILDREN OF GAD&#x2026;CAME. They thought of this first. Hence Scripture places them first.<sup><xref rid="fn2089">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THEY SAID&#x2026;LET THIS LAND BE GIVEN. Scripture repeats, <italic>and they said</italic> because they spoke at length.<sup><xref rid="fn2090">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that the word <italic>et</italic> is the object of <italic>yuttan</italic> (be given).<sup><xref rid="fn2091">4</xref></sup> I do not know why.<sup><xref rid="fn2092">5</xref></sup> Look, Scripture reads: <italic>netam eretz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2093">6</xref></sup> (the land is burnt up) (Is. 9:18); <italic>yechalek ha-aretz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2094">7</xref></sup> (the land shall be divided) (Num. 26:55);<sup><xref rid="fn2095">8</xref></sup> <italic>ve-lo nasa otom ha-aretz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2096">9</xref></sup> (and the land was not able to bear them) (Gen. 13:6); and <italic>asher hu va shammah be-kirbo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2097">10</xref></sup> (whither they go to be among them) (Deut. 31:16).</p>
<p>7. YE TURN AWAY. <italic>Teniyun</italic> (ye turn away) means you break.</p>
<p>9. FOR WHEN THEY WENT UP UNTO THE VALLEY OF ESHCOL. For those who went up<sup><xref rid="fn2098">11</xref></sup> to the north, went to the south.<sup><xref rid="fn2099">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THEY HAVE NOT WHOLLY FOLLOWED ME. There is no <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>mile&#x2019;u</italic> (wholly followed). <italic>Mile&#x2019;u</italic> is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2100">13</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>malle</italic> (fill)<sup><xref rid="fn2101">14</xref></sup> in <italic>fill thy horn with oil</italic> (I Sam. 16:1).</p>
<p>They did not complete what they started.<sup><xref rid="fn2102">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. CALEB THE SON OF JEPHUNNEH. Caleb is mentioned first, as in the case of God&#x2019;s oath.<sup><xref rid="fn2103">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>mile&#x2019;u</italic> (wholly followed) is similar to the word <italic>bikshu</italic> (have sought) in <italic>have sought after my soul</italic> (Ps. 44:5) and <italic>shilchu</italic> (they have set) in <italic>They have set Thy sanctuary on fire</italic> (Ps. 74:7).<sup><xref rid="fn2104">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND HE MADE THEM WANDER. <italic>Va-yeni&#x2019;em</italic> (and he made them wander) is related to the word <italic>na</italic> (a fugitive) in <italic>a fugitive and a wanderer</italic> (Gen. 4:12). Scripture reads <italic>va-yeni&#x2019;em</italic> because they did not rest.<sup><xref rid="fn2105">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. A BROOD. The word <italic>tarbut</italic> (a brood) is connected to the word <italic>ribbiti</italic> (brought up) in <italic>That I have dandled and brought up</italic> (Lam. 2:22). It is close in meaning to the word <italic>rav</italic> (officers) in <italic>all the officers</italic> (rav) <italic>of his house</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2106">19</xref></sup> (Esther 1:8). The meaning of <italic>tarbut</italic> is, grown up in years.</p>
<p>TO AUGMENT. <italic>Li-sepot</italic> (to augment) means the same as <italic>le-hosif</italic> (to add). However, it comes from a different root.<sup><xref rid="fn2107">20</xref></sup> The word <italic>sofu</italic> (add) in <italic>Add&#x2026;unto your sacrifices</italic> (Jer. 7:21) is similar,<sup><xref rid="fn2108">21</xref></sup> for we do not find this root<sup><xref rid="fn2109">22</xref></sup> among the stems that begin with a <italic>yod</italic> and drop the <italic>yod</italic> in the <italic>kal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2110">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND CITIES. First<sup><xref rid="fn2111">24</xref></sup> for our little ones.</p>
<p>17. READY. The word <italic>chushim</italic> (ready) is vocalized like the word <italic>mulim</italic> (circumcised) in <italic>were circumcised</italic> (Josh. 5:5). It means quickly. It is related to the word <italic>chushah</italic> (hasten) in <italic>Make speed, hasten, stay not</italic> (I Sam. 20:38).</p>
<p>19. AND FORWARD. The word <italic>ve-hale&#x2019;ah</italic> (and forward) is used with regard to both place<sup><xref rid="fn2112">25</xref></sup> and time.<sup><xref rid="fn2113">26</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ve-hale&#x2019;ah</italic> is, and above.<sup><xref rid="fn2114">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. UNTIL HE HATH DRIVEN OUT. God.<sup><xref rid="fn2115">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. BEFORE THE LORD. For the ark was there.<sup><xref rid="fn2116">29</xref></sup> <italic>Before the Lord</italic> is to be taken as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn2117">30</xref></sup> for the phrase<sup><xref rid="fn2118">31</xref></sup> is always used in a positive sense.<sup><xref rid="fn2119">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. FOR YOUR SHEEP. The <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>tzonakhem</italic> (your sheep) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn2120">33</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>he&#x2019;eznichu</italic> (become foul) in <italic>and the rivers shall become foul</italic> (Is. 19:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2121">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. EVERY MAN THAT IS ARMED FOR WAR. <italic>Kol chalutz tzava</italic> (every man that is armed for war) is similar to <italic>ha-aron ha-berit</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2122">35</xref></sup> (the ark of the covenant) (Josh. 3:14). Its meaning is, <italic>every man armed, armed for war</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2123">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. THEN YE SHALL GIVE THEM. The meaning of <italic>u-netattem la-hem</italic> is, you shall give them.<sup><xref rid="fn2124">37</xref></sup> The <italic>vav</italic> is like the Arabic <italic>fa</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2125">38</xref></sup> for such is the rule of the language.<sup><xref rid="fn2126">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. THEY SHALL HAVE POSSESSIONS AMONG YOU. He gave them respect,<sup><xref rid="fn2127">40</xref></sup> for the meaning of our verse is, if they<sup><xref rid="fn2128">41</xref></sup> will not go armed before you, then you shall force them to go with you and they shall have possessions among you.<sup><xref rid="fn2129">42</xref></sup> Or, if they change their minds, then they shall have possessions among you.</p>
<p>The word <italic>ve-nochazu</italic> (they shall have possessions) follows the rules of a root that has a <italic>yod</italic> as its first letter,<sup><xref rid="fn2130">43</xref></sup> for the letters <italic>alef, heh, vav</italic>, and <italic>yod</italic> interchange.</p>
<p>31. AND THE CHILDREN OF GAD&#x2026;ANSWERED. A second time for emphasis.</p>
<p>32. WE WILL PASS. The form <italic>nachnu</italic> (we) is the original form of the word. The <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>anachnu</italic> (we)<sup><xref rid="fn2131">44</xref></sup> is added. The half tribe of Manasseh is not mentioned until now because it was but half a tribe.</p>
<p>38. AND NEBO. It is likely that the reference is to Mount Nebo, where, as I shall explain,<sup><xref rid="fn2132">45</xref></sup> Moses was buried.</p>
<p>THEIR NAMES BEING CHANGED. These cities had their names changed.<sup><xref rid="fn2133">46</xref></sup> The same applies to Sibmah.<sup><xref rid="fn2134">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>39. AND DISPOSSESSED. Some say that Machir was alive.<sup><xref rid="fn2135">48</xref></sup> However, I believe that <italic>and dispossessed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2136">49</xref></sup> refers to the warrior that was in the family.<sup><xref rid="fn2137">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. [UNTO MACHIR THE SON OF MANASSEH.] The meaning of <italic>unto Machir the son of Manasseh</italic> is, unto the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh.<sup><xref rid="fn2138">51</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother</italic> (Jud. 1:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2139">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. AND JAIR THE SON OF MANASSEH. Jair was from the family of Judah.<sup><xref rid="fn2140">53</xref></sup> This is explicitly stated.<sup><xref rid="fn2141">54</xref></sup> For Hezron<sup><xref rid="fn2142">55</xref></sup> took the daughter of Machir the son of Manasseh, and she bore him Segub. Segub begot Jair,<sup><xref rid="fn2143">56</xref></sup> who had cities among the cities of Gilead.<sup><xref rid="fn2144">57</xref></sup> Jair is called after his mother&#x2019;s family. There were also <italic>kohanim</italic> who were called after the name of the children of Barzillai the Gileadite.<sup><xref rid="fn2145">58</xref></sup> The latter is clearly stated in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2146">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is no reason to ask: How did Jair<sup><xref rid="fn2147">60</xref></sup> inherit among another tribe,<sup><xref rid="fn2148">61</xref></sup> for it was the land of Canaan that was divided,<sup><xref rid="fn2149">62</xref></sup> not the land of the Amorites that was on the eastern side of the Jordan,<sup><xref rid="fn2150">63</xref></sup> for<sup><xref rid="fn2151">64</xref></sup> there were Amorites in the land of Canaan<sup><xref rid="fn2152">65</xref></sup> and they were the mightiest of the seven nations.</p>
<p>THE VILLAGES THEREOF. <italic>Chavvotehem</italic> (villages thereof) is to be interpreted in context.<sup><xref rid="fn2153">66</xref></sup> It means walled cities.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2088"><sup>1</sup> The son of Leah. Scripture mentions Reuben before Gad because he was the son of Leah whereas Gad was the son of Zilpah, who was a handmaiden. I.E. comments thus because the reverse is the case in verse 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2089"><sup>2</sup> Before the tribe of Reuben, even though the tribe of Reuben was descended from Leah and the tribe of Gad from Zilpah,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2090"><sup>3</sup> Verse 2 tells us that the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke (<italic>va-yomeru</italic>). Our verse reads, <italic>va-yomeru</italic> (and they said). The latter is superfluous. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2091"><sup>4</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>yuttan et ha-aretz</italic> (let&#x2026;[the] land be given). Now <italic>eretz</italic> is feminine. Thus our verse should read, <italic>tuttan et ha-aretz</italic>. Hence this opinion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2092"><sup>5</sup> These commentaries have to go to such extreme length.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2093"><sup>6</sup> <italic>Netem</italic> is masculine. We thus see that Scripture at times treats <italic>eretz</italic> as masculine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2094"><sup>7</sup> <italic>Yechalek</italic> is masculine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2095"><sup>8</sup> The reading in Num. 26:55 is, <italic>yechalek et ha-aretz</italic>. I.E. omits the <italic>et</italic> in his quote.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2096"><sup>9</sup> <italic>Nasa</italic> is masculine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2097"><sup>10</sup> <italic>Be-kirbo</italic> is masculine and refers to the land previously mentioned in the verse. See I.E. on Deut. 31:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2098"><sup>11</sup> Scripture reads, <italic>and they went up</italic>. According to I.E. this implies going north.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2099"><sup>12</sup> They went north from Kadesh-barnea, where they were camped, to the south of Israel. See I.E. on Num. 13:17. Note that we have rendered <italic>mi-tzafon</italic> to the north, for I.E. occasionally uses the <italic>mem</italic> to mean to. <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads: They went from the south to the north.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2100"><sup>13</sup> And therefore should have a <italic>dagesh</italic> in it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2101"><sup>14</sup> <italic>Malle</italic> is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> and has a <italic>dagesh</italic> in it. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verse 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2102"><sup>15</sup> The meaning of <italic>lo mile&#x2019;u acharai</italic> (because they have not wholly followed me).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2103"><sup>16</sup> God mentioned Caleb before Joshua. See Num. 14:30. and I.E.&#x2019;s comments thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2104"><sup>17</sup> Both <italic>bikshu</italic> and <italic>shilchu</italic> are <italic>pi&#x2019;els</italic> but, contrary to the rule, do not have a <italic>dagesh</italic> in them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2105"><sup>18</sup> During their sojourn in the wilderness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2106"><sup>19</sup> I.E. renders this as, all those brought up in his house.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2107"><sup>20</sup> <italic>Li-sepot</italic> comes from the root <italic>samekh, peh, heh</italic>. <italic>Hosif</italic> comes from the root <italic>yod, samekh, peh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2108"><sup>21</sup> To <italic>li-sepot</italic>; i.e., it comes from the root <italic>samekh, peh, heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2109"><sup>22</sup> The root <italic>yod, samekh, heh</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2115"><sup>28</sup> <italic>Horisho</italic> (He hath driven out) refers to God.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2117"><sup>30</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 16:34 (Vol. 2, p. 332). <italic>Before the Lord</italic> means before the divine glory which is upon the cherubim.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2118"><sup>31</sup> <italic>Li-fene Adonai</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2119"><sup>32</sup> The word <italic>li-fene Adonai</italic> (before the Lord) literally means before the Lord&#x2019;s face. This can be taken in a negative sense, that is, to anger God. See I.E. on the word <italic>li-fene</italic> in Gen. 11:28 (Vol. 1, p. 146).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2120"><sup>33</sup> The usual form of the word is <italic>tzonkhem</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2121"><sup>34</sup> Which is superfluous. The usual form is <italic>hiznichu</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2122"><sup>35</sup> <italic>Ha-aron</italic> has a <italic>heh</italic>, the definite article, prefixed to it. Such a word cannot be in the construct. Hence our phrase reads, the ark, the covenant. This should be read as if written, the ark, ark of the covenant. See I.E. on Gen. 2:9 (Vol. 1, p. 54, and the notes thereto).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2123"><sup>36</sup> In I.E.&#x2019;s edition of the Pentateuch the word <italic>chalutz</italic> was apparently vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>. This being the case, the verse read, armed, war. Hence I.E. suggests that our verse be read as if written, armed, armed for war (Motot). It should be noted that in our versions of Scripture the word <italic>chalutz</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>chataf pattach</italic> and is in the construct with <italic>tzava</italic>. It thus reads, armed for war.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2124"><sup>37</sup> In other words, the <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to <italic>netattem</italic> does not mean and. It is placed there for emphasis and is not to be translated.</ftnote>

<h1>MASSEY</h1>
<p>1. THESE ARE THE STAGES. Moses recorded all the journeys of the Israelites when the children of Israel camped in the plains of Moab<sup><xref rid="fn2154">1</xref></sup> and stayed there for a number of months, until the afore-mentioned cities<sup><xref rid="fn2155">2</xref></sup> were built. They did not move from there until Aaron died.<sup><xref rid="fn2156">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. THEIR GOINGS FORTH. How they went from place to place. Therefore <italic>their goings forth</italic> follows.</p>
<p>BY THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD. This is connected to <italic>stage by stage</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2157">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. ON THE MORROW AFTER THE PASSOVER. I have explained this,<sup><xref rid="fn2158">5</xref></sup> and <italic>with a high hand</italic> (Ex. 14:8)<sup><xref rid="fn2159">6</xref></sup> as well.</p>
<p>4. UPON THEIR GODS ALSO THE LORD EXECUTED JUDGMENTS. As in the incident with Dagan&#x2019;s head.<sup><xref rid="fn2160">7</xref></sup> For God said so to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2161">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND TURNED BACK. This alludes to the cloud<sup><xref rid="fn2162">9</xref></sup> or to Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2163">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. FROM PENE-HAHIROTH. Pene-hahirot and Pi-hahiroth<sup><xref rid="fn2164">11</xref></sup> refers to the same place. The mouth is in the face.<sup><xref rid="fn2165">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>THREE DAYS&#x2019; JOURNEY. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn2166">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. KIBROTH-HATTAAVAH. The latter is in Kadesh-barnea,<sup><xref rid="fn2167">14</xref></sup> as I explained.</p>
<p>37. AND THEY JOURNEYED FROM KADESH. Kadesh is the name of a city.<sup><xref rid="fn2168">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. [AND THE CANAANITE&#x2026;HEARD.] Scripture tells us this here<sup><xref rid="fn2169">16</xref></sup> because the Canaanite fought with Israel at Hor ha-Hor.<sup><xref rid="fn2170">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>42. ZALMONAH, AND&#x2026;PUNON. I have explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn2171">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>46. ALMON-DIBLATHAIM. This is a general term for many journeys, as I explained in the Torah portion, <italic>This is the statute of the law</italic> (Num. 19:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2172">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>49. FROM BETH-JESHIMOTH. This is the valley which looks down upon the wasteland.<sup><xref rid="fn2173">20</xref></sup> God then commanded Moses to warn Israel<sup><xref rid="fn2174">21</xref></sup> because they were soon to pass over.<sup><xref rid="fn2175">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>52. THEIR FIGURED STONES. <italic>Maskiyyotam</italic> (their figured stones) is similar to <italic>ve-even maskit</italic> (any figured stone) (Lev. 26:1).</p>
<p>THEIR HIGH PLACES. <italic>Bamotam</italic> means their high places. Compare, <italic>bamate aretz</italic> (the high places of the earth) (Is. 58:14).</p>
<p>54. AND YE SHALL INHERIT THE LAND. <italic>Ve-hitnachaltem</italic> (and ye shall inherit) is similar to <italic>ve-hitavvitem</italic> (and ye shall mark out) (Num. 34 :10).<sup><xref rid="fn2176">23</xref></sup> <italic>Ha-aretz</italic> (the land) is the object.<sup><xref rid="fn2177">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture mentions <italic>to the more ye shall give the more inheritance</italic> to connect <italic>But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants</italic> (v. 55) which comes after it.<sup><xref rid="fn2178">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>55. AS THORNS. <italic>Sikkim</italic> refers to sharp thorns. It is related to the word <italic>mesukkato</italic> (hedge thereof)<sup><xref rid="fn2179">26</xref></sup> in <italic>the hedge thereof</italic> (Is. 5:5) and the word <italic>sakh</italic> (hedge) in <italic>behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns</italic> (Hos. 2:8).</p>
<p>AND AS PRICKS. The word <italic>tzeninim</italic> (pricks) is to be explained according to its context. It means the same as <italic>u-leshotet be-tziddekhem</italic> (a scourge in your sides) (Josh. 23:13), which<sup><xref rid="fn2180">27</xref></sup> refers to a blow delivered by a whip.<sup><xref rid="fn2181">28</xref></sup> On the other hand, the word <italic>tzeninim</italic> (pricks) might refer to sharp thorns, as in <italic>Thorns</italic> (tzinnim) <italic>and snares in the way of the froward</italic> (Prov. 22:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2182">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observe, Scripture further explains<sup><xref rid="fn2183">30</xref></sup> the borders of their inheritance from which they are obligated to expel the inhabitants of the land.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2154"><sup>1</sup> Verse 48.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2155"><sup>2</sup> The cities mentioned in Num. 32:33-42.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2156"><sup>3</sup> This appears to be an error, for Aaron died at Mount Hor before Israel came to the plains of Moab. See Num. 20:22-29. The proper reading should be, until Moses died.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2157"><sup>4</sup> Our text should be read: Stage by stage by the commandment of the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2158"><sup>5</sup> See I.E. on Lev. 23:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2159"><sup>6</sup> See I.E. on Lev. 23:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2160"><sup>7</sup> I Sam. 5:4. Dagan fell headless, armless, and footless before the ark of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2161"><sup>8</sup> In other words, God executed judgment as he had told Moses he would (Ex. 12:12). I. E. notes this because Scripture does not previously tells us that God actually executed judgment on the Egyptian gods.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2162"><sup>9</sup> Which accompanied Israel. <italic>Va-yisu</italic> (and they journeyed) is in the plural. <italic>Va-yashav</italic> (and turned back) is in the singular. Thus our verse may be rendered: and they journeyed and it turned back. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2163"><sup>10</sup> According to this interpretation Scripture refers to Israel in the singular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2164"><sup>11</sup> See Ex. 14:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2165"><sup>12</sup> <italic>Pi</italic> means mouth of; <italic>pene</italic> face of. Hence the names Pi-hahiroth and Pene-hahiroth for the same place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2166"><sup>13</sup> See I.E. on Num. 10:31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2167"><sup>14</sup> See I.E. on Num. 20:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2168"><sup>15</sup> See I.E. on Num. 20:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2169"><sup>16</sup> After mentioning Mount Hor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2170"><sup>17</sup> Following the death of Aaron. See Num. 21:1-3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2171"><sup>18</sup> See I.E. on Num. 21:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2172"><sup>19</sup> See I.E. on Num. 21:18.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2177"><sup>24</sup> In other words, <italic>ve-hitnachaltem</italic> is transitive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2178"><sup>25</sup> In other words, the law commanding Israel to drive out the Canaanites follows the law telling Israel to inherit Canaan, in order to warn Israel that they will not inherit the land if they permit Canaanites to dwell therein.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2179"><sup>26</sup> The hedge spoken of in Is. 5:5 was made of sharp thorns.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2180"><sup>27</sup> According to its context. See Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2181"><sup>28</sup> So too the word <italic>tzeninim</italic>. Thus <italic>ve-litzninim be-tziddekhem</italic> (and as pricks in your sides) means, and lashes in their sides.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2182"><sup>29</sup> In this case, <italic>ve-litzninim be-tziddekhem</italic> (and for pricks in your sides) means, and for thorns in their sides.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2183"><sup>30</sup> In chapter 34.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 34</title>
<p>2. INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN. <italic>Ha-aretz kena&#x2019;an</italic> (the land of Canaan) is similar to <italic>ve-hanevu&#x2019;ah oded ha-navi</italic> (even the prophecy of Oded the prophet) (II Chron. 15:8), the meaning of which is, the prophecy, prophecy of Oded the prophet. The meaning of our clause is, the land, land of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn2184">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. BY THE SIDE OF EDOM. The word <italic>yede</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2185">2</xref></sup> (side of) means place of. Compare, <italic>by the side of</italic> (yad)<sup><xref rid="fn2186">3</xref></sup> <italic>the Jordan</italic> (Num. 13:29).</p>
<p>5. UNTO THE BROOK OF EGYPT. <italic>Nachlah mitzrayim</italic> means unto the brook of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2187">4</xref></sup> It does not refer to the Nile.</p>
<p>6. THE GREAT SEA. The Spanish sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2188">5</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: And the Great Sea shall be your western border.<sup><xref rid="fn2189">6</xref></sup> The Great Sea itself shall serve as the border.<sup><xref rid="fn2190">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND YE SHALL MARK OUT. The <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>ve-hitavvitem</italic> (and ye shall mark out) is in place of a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2191">8</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ve-hitvita</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2192">9</xref></sup> <italic>tav</italic> (and set a mark) (Ezek. 9:4). This is so, even though the forms differ.<sup><xref rid="fn2193">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND YE SHALL MARK OUT. <italic>Ve-hitavvitem</italic> (and ye shall mark out) is similar to the word <italic>ta&#x2019;avat</italic> (utmost bound) in <italic>Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills</italic> (Gen. 49:26).<sup><xref rid="fn2194">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND SHALL STRIKE. The word <italic>machah</italic> (strike) is to be interpreted as the ancients did. It means it shall break.<sup><xref rid="fn2195">12</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>yimcha&#x2019;u</italic> (clap) in <italic>Let the floods clap their hands</italic> (Ps. 98:8).</p>
<p>15. THE TWO TRIBES. Scripture mentions this a second time<sup><xref rid="fn2196">13</xref></sup> in order to explain the place of their inheritance.<sup><xref rid="fn2197">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. SHALL TAKE POSSESSION. <italic>Yinchalu</italic> (shall take possession) is a causative.<sup><xref rid="fn2198">15</xref></sup> The same applies to the word <italic>u-nechaltanu</italic> (and take us for Thine inheritance) (Ex. 34:9)<sup><xref rid="fn2199">16</xref></sup> in the opinion of the grammarians.</p>
<p>ELEAZAR. He is mentioned first<sup><xref rid="fn2200">17</xref></sup> because Joshua went out by his command. Furthermore, Eleazar was also the son of Aaron. Scripture does not mention the princes of the tribes of Reuben or Gad,<sup><xref rid="fn2201">18</xref></sup> for they<sup><xref rid="fn2202">19</xref></sup> had already taken their share.</p>
<p>The commentaries say that Scripture starts<sup><xref rid="fn2203">20</xref></sup> with Judah,<sup><xref rid="fn2204">21</xref></sup> for that is the way the lot came out at first.<sup><xref rid="fn2205">22</xref></sup> However, there is a great argument against them.<sup><xref rid="fn2206">23</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the comments appear correct to us.<sup><xref rid="fn2207">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. PEDAHEL. If the <italic>heh</italic> in Pedahel is silent then we have two words each with its own meaning,<sup><xref rid="fn2208">25</xref></sup> for the <italic>heh</italic> is not an implied letter.<sup><xref rid="fn2209">26</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2184"><sup>1</sup> <italic>Ha-aretz</italic> has the definite article prefixed to it. According to the rules of Hebrew grammar, a word with the definite article cannot be in the construct. The literal meaning of <italic>ha-aretz kena&#x2019;an</italic> (the land of Canaan) thus is, the land Canaan. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that our verse be read as if written, <italic>ha-aretz, eretz kena&#x2019;an. Ve-hanevu&#x2019;ah oded ha-navi</italic> (even the prophecy of Oded the prophet) (II Chron. 15:8) is, for similar reasons, to be read, <italic>ve-hanevu&#x2019;ah nevu&#x2019;at oded ha-navi</italic>. See I.E. on Gen. 2:9 (Vol. 1, p. 54).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2185"><sup>2</sup> Literally, hands of. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2186"><sup>3</sup> Literally, hand of. See I.E. on Gen. 1:26 (Vol. 1, pp. 45-46).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2187"><sup>4</sup> For the <italic>heh</italic> suffixed to <italic>nachlah</italic> is in place of the preposition <italic>el</italic> (unto).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2188"><sup>5</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s term for the Mediterranean Sea.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2189"><sup>6</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>u-gavel yam</italic>. This should be rendered, and for the western border not, and the sea. The word <italic>yam</italic> can mean either the sea or the west. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2190"><sup>7</sup> Our verse literally reads, and the border on the west, ye shall have the Great Sea, and a border. I.E. renders this, you shall have the Great Sea itself serve as your border on the west</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2191"><sup>8</sup> <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads, in place of a <italic>tav</italic>. The root of <italic>ve-hitavvitem</italic> appears to be <italic>alef, vav, heh</italic>. This root means to desire. <italic>And you shall desire</italic> appears out of place here. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s suggestion that <italic>ve-hitavvitem</italic> comes from the root <italic>tav, vav, heh</italic>, which means to mark out. <italic>And you shall mark out</italic> fits in well within the context of our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2192"><sup>9</sup> Which comes from the root <italic>tav, vav, heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2193"><sup>10</sup> <italic>Ve-hitavvitem</italic> is in the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic> while <italic>ve-hitvita</italic> is a <italic>hif&#x2019;il</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2194"><sup>11</sup> I.E. makes the same point in Genesis. See Vol. 1, p. 447.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2195"><sup>12</sup> When the boundary line reaches the lake of Kinneret, it will create a broken (not a straight) border (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2196"><sup>13</sup> The first half of our verse repeats the previous verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2197"><sup>14</sup> The second part of our verse tells us where the two and a half tribes received their inheritance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2198"><sup>15</sup> Even though it is a <italic>kal</italic>. According to I. E. the word <italic>yinchalu</italic> here should be rendered, shall cause you to take possession, rather than shall take possession.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2199"><sup>16</sup> According to I.E., <italic>u-nechaltanu</italic> (and take us for Thine inheritance) should be rendered, you will cause us to inherit. See I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary on Ex. 34:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2200"><sup>17</sup> Before Joshua.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2201"><sup>18</sup> In listing the princes of the tribes in verses 17-28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2202"><sup>19</sup> Their tribes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2203"><sup>20</sup> In listing the tribes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2204"><sup>21</sup> Even though Simeon was older.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2205"><sup>22</sup> When the land was actually divided. See Joshua 15:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2206"><sup>23</sup> If Scripture followed the order in which the tribes actually received their inheritance, the children of Joseph should have followed Judah, for they took their inheritance after Judah. See Joshua 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2207"><sup>24</sup> For no one can offer a better reason than these commentaries for listing Judah first (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2208"><sup>25</sup> The <italic>heh</italic> is silent only when it comes at the end of a word. It is not silent when it comes in the middle of a word. Since the <italic>heh</italic> in the name Pedahel is silent we must interpret it as two words, <italic>padah el</italic> (God redeemed). I.E.&#x2019;s point is that while many of the Hebrew names containing God&#x2019;s name are partially abbreviated, this is not the case with Pedahel.</ftnote>

<p>2. AND OPEN LAND. The meaning of <italic>migrash</italic> (open land) is known.<sup><xref rid="fn2210">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN. The meaning of <italic>artzah kena&#x2019;an</italic> (into the land of Canaan) is known.<sup><xref rid="fn2211">2</xref></sup> This chapter, like others,<sup><xref rid="fn2212">3</xref></sup> is connected.<sup><xref rid="fn2213">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THEN YE SHALL APPOINT YOU CITIES. The word <italic>ve-hikritem</italic> (then shall ye appoint you) is related to the word <italic>kiryah</italic> (cities).<sup><xref rid="fn2214">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. This is not connected to the previous verse,<sup><xref rid="fn2215">6</xref></sup> for the preceding verse states that these cities will be cities of refuge. However, it does not state for whom they shall serve as cities of refuge. Scripture then explains<sup><xref rid="fn2216">7</xref></sup> that these six cities shall serve as cities of refuge <italic>for the children of Israel, and for the stranger&#x2026;who lives among them</italic>.</p>
<p>19. WHEN HE MEETETH HIM. The <italic>feh</italic> of <italic>bi-figo</italic> (when he meeteth him) is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2217">8</xref></sup> like the word <italic>shivri</italic> (I break) in <italic>when I break</italic> (Lev. 26:26), for vocalization changes in the infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn2218">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND IF HE THRUST HIM. From a high place.</p>
<p>OR HURLED AT HIM. An inclining wall<sup><xref rid="fn2219">10</xref></sup> or a deadly object.</p>
<p>LYING IN WAIT. I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>bi-tzediyyah</italic> (lying in wait).<sup><xref rid="fn2220">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. SUDDENLY. The meaning of <italic>be-feta</italic> is suddenly.<sup><xref rid="fn2221">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. SEEING HIM NOT. <italic>Re&#x2019;ot</italic> is an infinitive.</p>
<p>AND HE WAS NOT HIS ENEMY. He had no intention of seeking his harm.</p>
<p>25. THEREIN UNTIL THE DEATH OF THE HIGH PRIEST. Some say that the meaning of <italic>until the death of</italic> is, until the investigation of.<sup><xref rid="fn2222">13</xref></sup> They compare it to <italic>And wisdom shall die with you</italic> (Job. 12:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2223">14</xref></sup> However, what they say is worthless. For <italic>And wisdom shall die with you</italic> means exactly what it says,<sup><xref rid="fn2224">15</xref></sup> as does <italic>until the death of the high priest</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2225">16</xref></sup> For the high priest atones on behalf of Israel, and this incident happened during his lifetime.<sup><xref rid="fn2226">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. THE BORDER OF HIS CITY. <italic>Et gevul</italic> means beyond<sup><xref rid="fn2227">18</xref></sup> the border.<sup><xref rid="fn2228">19</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>et ha-ir</italic> (out of the city) in <italic>as I am gone out of the city</italic> (Ex. 9:29).</p>
<p>27. BLOODGUILTINESS. I have already explained the meaning of <italic>dam</italic> (bloodguiltiness).<sup><xref rid="fn2229">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. SO YE SHALL NOT POLLUTE. Do evil in secret.</p>
<p>SHED IT. <italic>Shofkho</italic> (shed it) is a verb.<sup><xref rid="fn2230">21</xref></sup> Compare <italic>go&#x2019;alo</italic> (his redeemer)<sup><xref rid="fn2231">22</xref></sup> in <italic>then shall his redeemer&#x2026;come</italic> (Lev. 25:25).</p>
<p>34. AND THOU SHALT NOT DEFILE<sup><xref rid="fn2232">23</xref></sup> THE LAND. The pollution shall not defile the land.<sup><xref rid="fn2233">24</xref></sup> Or it is a command.<sup><xref rid="fn2234">25</xref></sup> The land shall not be polluted because I dwell among them.<sup><xref rid="fn2235">26</xref></sup> I do not dwell there out of respect for the land but out of respect for the children of Israel. Therefore Scripture says, <italic>I the Lord dwell in the midst of the children of Israel</italic> (v. 34).</p>
<ftnote id="fn2210"><sup>1</sup> Hence there is no need to explain its meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2211"><sup>2</sup> The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>artzah</italic> is in place of the preposition <italic>el</italic>. Thus <italic>artzah kena&#x2019;an</italic> means into the land of Canaan.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2213"><sup>4</sup> To the chapter which precedes it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2214"><sup>5</sup> From the word <italic>kir</italic>, a wall. <italic>Kiryah</italic> is thus a walled city. <italic>Ve-hikritem lakhem arim</italic> thus means, and you shall build walled cities.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2219"><sup>10</sup> Pushed the wall down upon him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2220"><sup>11</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 21:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2221"><sup>12</sup> The usual word for suddenly is <italic>pitom</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2222"><sup>13</sup> Until the high priest investigates the death of the victim. For other interpretations see Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2223"><sup>14</sup> They render this, and with you is wisdom searched out.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2225"><sup>16</sup> Which is to be taken literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2226"><sup>17</sup> Hence the murderer shall remain in the city of exile to remind the high priest of his failing. The high priest&#x2019;s piety should have prevented the murder (see Rashi). Or, the murderer shall remain in exile to remind the high priest to pray constantly that God forgive Israel for the bloodshed in its midst.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2227"><sup>18</sup> Literally, from.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2228"><sup>19</sup> The word <italic>et</italic> is usually not translated. Hence I.E. points out that here it means from.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2229"><sup>20</sup> Our clause literally reads, he has no blood. Hence I.E. points out that blood means bloodshed. Thus our clause should be rendered, he is not guilty of bloodshed. See I.E. on Ex. 22:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2230"><sup>21</sup> Not a noun. It is made up of the verb <italic>shofekh</italic> (shedder) and the word <italic>shelo</italic> (its)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2231"><sup>22</sup> Which is a verb made up of the word <italic>go&#x2019;el</italic> (redeems) and <italic>shelo</italic> (him) (translated according to I.E.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2232"><sup>23</sup> Hebrew, <italic>titamme</italic>. <italic>Titamme</italic> can be rendered either as you shall defile or it shall defile. Hence the interpretations which follow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2233"><sup>24</sup> This interpretation renders <italic>ve-lo titamme</italic>, it shall not defile.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 36</title>
<p>1. CAME NEAR. This chapter<sup><xref rid="fn2236">1</xref></sup> also is connected to the one that comes before it. When Moses commanded the Israelites to give the Levites cities from the inheritance of Israel [the heads of the fathers&#x2019; houses drew near].</p>
<p>THE HEADS OF THE FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSES. The reference is to the princes.<sup><xref rid="fn2237">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND WHEN THE JUBILEE&#x2026;SHALL BE. Even if the jubilee shall be,<sup><xref rid="fn2238">3</xref></sup> we have no hope of the inheritance returning to us, for it shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe.<sup><xref rid="fn2239">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. THE TRIBE OF THE SONS OF JOSEPH SPEAKETH RIGHT. For the heads of the fathers&#x2019; houses spoke on behalf of the entire tribe.</p>
<p>7. [SO SHALL NO INHERITANCE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL REMOVE FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE.] The meaning of <italic>tissov</italic> (remove) is, shall not turn<sup><xref rid="fn2240">5</xref></sup> from here to there,<sup><xref rid="fn2241">6</xref></sup> be it from them<sup><xref rid="fn2242">7</xref></sup> or from others.<sup><xref rid="fn2243">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>so shall no inheritance be removed</italic> is, no inheritance shall be removed from this day and onward even though they had not as yet inherited the land.</p>
<p>8. AND EVERY DAUGHTER, THAT POSSESSETH AN INHERITANCE. After the inheritance of the land. Scripture therefore states a second time, <italic>So shall no inheritance remove</italic> [<italic>from one tribe to another tribe</italic>] (v. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn2244">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. MAHLAH, TIRZAH. Scripture first mentioned them<sup><xref rid="fn2245">10</xref></sup> in the order of their birth. It now mentions them in the order in which they were first taken by men in marriage.</p>
<p>12. THEY WERE MARRIED INTO THE FAMILIES. This<sup><xref rid="fn2246">11</xref></sup> is a sign that their cousins<sup><xref rid="fn2247">12</xref></sup> were not all brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn2248">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. THESE ARE THE COMMANDMENTS. Relating to inheritance,<sup><xref rid="fn2249">14</xref></sup> vows,<sup><xref rid="fn2250">15</xref></sup> and every daughter that possesseth an inheritance,<sup><xref rid="fn2251">16</xref></sup> and the laws regarding bloodshed.<sup><xref rid="fn2252">17</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn2236"><sup>1</sup> Like other chapters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2237"><sup>2</sup> Of the tribes. Hence Scripture reads, <italic>before the princes, the heads of the fathers&#x2019; houses of the children of Israel</italic> (v. 1).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2238"><sup>3</sup> I.E. renders <italic>ve-im yiheyah ha-yovel</italic> (and when the jubilee shall be), and even if the jubilee shall be.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2239"><sup>4</sup> Into which they married.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2240"><sup>5</sup> Shall not move around. <italic>Tissov</italic> comes from the root <italic>samekh, bet, bet</italic>, meaning to turn.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2241"><sup>6</sup> Emending <italic>mi-po u-mi-po</italic> (from here and from here) to <italic>mi-po le-po</italic> (from here to there) (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2242"><sup>7</sup> The tribe of Joseph, who argued their case before Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2243"><sup>8</sup> Any other tribe.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2244"><sup>9</sup> In other words, verse 7 speaks of the present. Verse 8 speaks of the future.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2245"><sup>10</sup> In Num. 27:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2246"><sup>11</sup> The word families.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2247"><sup>12</sup> The cousins who married the daughters of Zelophehad.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2248"><sup>13</sup> If they were, then Scripture would have read, they were married into the &#x201C;family&#x201D; rather than they married into the &#x201C;families.&#x201D;</ftnote>
