<title>FOREWORD</title>
<p>In the introduction to the Book of Genesis, note was taken of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s influence on biblical exegesis. However, Ibn Ezra was not only a great Bible commentator, he was also a profound thinker who greatly influenced Jewish philosophical and mystical thought. Hence, as we approach the conclusion of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentary on the Pentateuch a discussion of this commentary&#x2019;s influence on the development of Jewish thought seems appropriate.</p>
<h1>MAIMONIDES</h1>
<p>Moses Maimonides was beyond doubt the greatest medieval Jewish philosopher. Students of Jewish philosophy have noted a close affinity between the philosophical writings of Abraham Ibn Ezra and those of Moses Maimonides. Entire passages in Maimonides&#x2019; <italic>Guide for the Perplexed</italic> (translated by M. Friedlander, Dover Publishing Co., New York, 1956, reprint of the 1904 revised edition) appear to elaborate points made by Ibn Ezra.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra believed that man&#x2019;s uniqueness lies in his intellect. He tells us that &#x201C;man&#x2019;s intelligence is the angel which mediates between him and his God&#x201D; (I.E., Vol. 1, Introduction, p. 10). Maimonides held a similar point of view (<italic>Guide</italic>, 1:1, p. 14; 3:51, p. 386).</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra held that the Torah is to be interpreted in accordance with the dictates of reason. He believed that &#x201C;every precept, be it minor or major, must be weighed in the scale of one&#x2019;s heart wherein the Eternal has planted some of his wisdom. Thus when there appears something in the Torah that is intellectually impossible to accept or contrary to the evidence of our senses, then we must search for a hidden meaning. This is so because intelligence is the basis of the Torah. The Torah was not given to ignoramuses&#x201D; (I.E., Vol. 1, Introduction, p. 10).</p>
<p>Maimonides had an identical notion. In fact, one of his reasons for writing the <italic>Guide for the Perplexed</italic> was to interpret traditional Jewish teachings in accordance with the dictates of reason (Introduction to the <italic>Guide</italic>, p. 2). One of his methods of doing so is to attribute secret meanings to passages in the Bible, Talmud, and Midrash which contradict reason (<italic>Ibid.</italic>, p. 3).</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra believed that there are secret interpretations of the Torah that are best kept from the common people and that it is necessary to write in such a way that only the initiated will understand. Thus he notes that there is a bird that cannot see on sunny days and is able to see only at night. In other words, some people are better kept in the dark, for they cannot comprehend the full truth (I.E., Vol. 1, Introduction, p. 14). Throughout his commentary Ibn Ezra hints at secrets, either by actually saying so or by such statements as <italic>and the intelligent will understand</italic>, or <italic>I cannot explain</italic>, or <italic>a secret</italic> (sod) <italic>is hidden here</italic>.</p>
<p>This is precisely the method chosen by Maimonides in the <italic>Guide</italic>. In a sentence reminiscent of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s parable of the bird that cannot see during the day, Maimonides writes that Scripture spoke in metaphors &#x201C;in order that the educated may comprehend it according to the measure of their faculties and the feebleness of their apprehension, while the educated persons may take it in a different sense&#x201D; (<italic>Guide</italic>, Introduction, p. 4).</p>
<p>According to Ibn Ezra man gains immortality by developing his soul. &#x201C;If the soul grows wise it will share the secrets of the angels and will then cleave to God the Glorious&#x201D; (I.E. on Ex. 3:15; see also <italic>Yesod Mora</italic>, 1). Maimonides had a similar notion (<italic>Guide</italic>, 3:8, p. 26; 3:54, p. 395).</p>
<p>According to the Talmud the expression <italic>dibberah torah kelashon bene adam</italic> (the Torah spoke in the language of man) is employed only in a <italic>halakhic</italic> sense. No laws are to be extended or derived from what appears to be biblical verbosity, as in the phrase <italic>hikaret yikaret</italic> (shall utterly be cut off) (Num. 15:31), or <italic>ish ish</italic> (any man) (Lev. 15:2), or <italic>ganev yigganev</italic> (but if it be stolen) (Ex. 22:11).</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra also applies the above to those parts of Scripture which speak of God in human terms. Thus in commenting on Gen. 1:26 (Vol. 1, p. 46,47) Ibn Ezra writes: &#x201C;We know that the Torah spoke the language of man, for it was given to humans who speak and hear. Now a human being cannot speak of things above or below him without employing human terminology. Hence Scripture uses such terms as <italic>the mouth of the earth</italic> (Num. 16:30), <italic>the hand of the Jordan</italic> (Num. 13:29), and <italic>the head of the dust of the world</italic>&#x201D; (Prov. 8:26).</p>
<p>Similarly in commenting on <italic>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and He ceased from work and rested on the seventh day</italic>, I.E. writes, <italic>ve-hatorah dibberah ke-lashon bene adam</italic> (the Torah spoke in the language of man) (I.E. on Ex. 31:17, Vol. 2, p. 652).</p>
<p>Maimonides follows suit in his commentary on the Mishnah (Introduction to Chapter 10 of <italic>Sanhedrin</italic>); in his <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic> (<italic>Hilkhot Yesode Ha-Torah</italic>, 1:9); and in the <italic>Guide for the Perplexed</italic> (1:26,27, pp. 35,36).</p>
<p>There are many <italic>aggadot</italic> in the Talmud which run counter to reason. Ibn Ezra claimed that many of these <italic>aggadot</italic> have a secret meaning. &#x201C;There is a secret meaning to the midrashic statement to the effect that the world will exist for 6,000 years (I.E. on Gen. 1:15, Vol. 1, p. 33); as to the Midrash which states one (the sun) was not greater than the other (the moon), there is a secret meaning to it&#x201D; (I.E. on Gen. 1:16, Vol. 1, p. 39). &#x201C;The Rabbinic statement that Noah drank from his vineyard on the day he planted it is not to be taken literally&#x201D; (I.E. on Gen. 9:20, Vol. 1, p. 127). &#x201C;Our sages say that God showed Moses the knot of the <italic>tefillin</italic>. These words are correct. However, its meaning is not in accordance with that of the wise men of this generation who interpret the Rabbinic statement literally. On the contrary, this has a deeply hidden secret meaning&#x201D; (I.E. on Ex. 33:21, Vol. 2, p. 693).</p>
<p>Maimonides similarly believed that many <italic>aggadot</italic> have a hidden meaning. In his introduction to the <italic>Guide</italic> he tells us that he refrained from writing a work explaining the <italic>aggadot</italic> because when a person who is both religious and well-educated reads them he will either take them literally and question the reasoning abilities of their author (which, according to Maimonides offers no challenge to faith), or he will assume that the passages in question has some secret meaning (<italic>Guide</italic>, Introduction, p. 5).</p>
<p>Speaking of God, Ibn Ezra writes: <italic>&#x201C;Hu le-vado yode&#x2019;a, veda&#x2019;at ve-yadu&#x2019;a</italic> (He is the knower, the content of His thought, and the object of His thought)&#x201D; (Ex. 34:6).</p>
<p>This dictum is often quoted by Maimonides (Introduction to Tractate <italic>Avot</italic>; <italic>Hilkhot Yesode Ha-Torah</italic> 2:10). He also devoted an entire chapter of the <italic>Guide for the Perplexed</italic> (1:68) to explaining this concept.</p>
<p>The medieval Jewish philosophers were concerned with explaining the divine commandments. Saadiah Gaon divided the commandments into traditional (a-rational) commandments and rational commandments. Ibn Ezra disagreed with this differentiation. Believing that all the divine commandments are rational, he argues: &#x201C;All of the commandments fall into one of the following two categories. One category consists of rational laws which God implanted into the minds of all intelligent human beings. There are many such commandments. The only one of the Ten Statements which does not fall into this category is the command to observe the Sabbath&#x2026;The second category that the precepts fall into is that of &#x2018;Hidden Commandments,&#x2019; that is, commandments for which the Torah does not reveal any reason. Far be it, far be it for one to even think that any of these commandments contradict reason. We must in all instances observe everything that God has commanded us, whether their secret has or has not been revealed to us&#x2026;(we) must search for its meaning in the books of the wise men, of blessed memory&#x2026;we must investigate and try to understand it with all our strength&#x201D; (I.E. on Ex. 20:1, Vol. 2, pp. 407-409).</p>
<p>Maimonides accepted Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s premise. He too asserts that all commandments of the Torah have a purpose and that their purposes can be discovered (<italic>Guide</italic>, 3:26, pp. 310-312).</p>
<p>However, Maimonides differs with some of the reasons which Ibn Ezra gave for the commandments. Ibn Ezra believed that some commandments, such as the ones concerning priestly garments and the temple service, have astrological or mystical import (I.E. on Ex. 25:40, Vol. 2, pp. 558-562; Ex. 20:5, Vol. 2, pp. 591-598). Maimonides disagreed. He gave a purely rational explanation for all the commandments.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra held that ultimate religious development requires an ascetic life. &#x201C;Note that most people are slaves to worldly lusts. The true king, the one who has a crown, the one who wears the royal diadem, is the person who is free from this lust&#x201D; (I.E. on Num. 6:7, Vol. 4, p. 43). I.E. believed that Moses refrained from sexual relations with his wife because of his spirituality (I.E. on Num. 12:1, Vol. 4, p. 94, and notes thereto). Maimonides had a similar notion (<italic>Guide</italic>, 3:8, p. 263).</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra considered man to be a microcosm (<italic>olam katan</italic>) (Ibn Ezra on Gen. 1:26). Maimonides agreed with this concept (<italic>Guide</italic>, 1:72, pp. 113-119).</p>
<p>It is impossible to say how much Maimonides actually took from Ibn Ezra. However, there can be no doubt that the influence was substantial.</p>
<h1>OTHER JEWISH SCHOLARS AND MOVEMENTS</h1>
<p>The writings of Ibn Ezra served as basic texts for many Jewish scholars. Leon Jehuda Mosconi, who wrote a supercommentary on Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentary on the Pentateuch (between 1362 and 1370), noted that he was aware of thirty supercommentaries on Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s works. Solomon Delmedigo of Candia (1591-1655) similarly reported seeing some twenty-four commentaries on Ibn Ezra in Constantinople.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s thinking not only influenced Jewish philosophers, it also affected mystical trends of Jewish thought. The writings of Ibn Ezra influenced the <italic>Haside Ashkenaz</italic>, the Kabbalists [I. Tishby, <italic>The Wisdom of the Zohar</italic> (Hebrew), Israel, 1957, pp. 90,91], and the Hasidic movement.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra taught that God is one. He is the creator of all. He is all. According to Ibn Ezra, God&#x2019;s relationship to the world is comparable to the relationship of the number &#x201C;one,&#x201D; which is the first all numbers and is found in all numbers (I.E. on Ex. 33:21, Vol. 2, p. 695). Similarly, the world emanated from God, and from this aspect God can be said to be all. The Hasidic movement has a similar belief. Hasidic doctrine stresses that there is no place devoid of God&#x2019;s presence (<italic>let atar panuy mineh</italic>) (Sheneyur Zalman of Ladi, <italic>Tanya</italic>, 22; <italic>Iggeret Ha-Rav</italic>, 1:218).</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra held that the true religious life consists in directing one&#x2019;s thoughts to God and cleaving to God. In his commentary on Num. 20:8 he writes, &#x201C;When the part (man) knows the All (God), he cleaves (<italic>yidbak</italic>) to the All and creates signs and wonders with the help of the All.&#x201D; I.E. believed that cleaving to God will ultimately lead to eternal life (Deut. 11:22). This is the purpose of the commandments. Thus Ibn Ezra writes: &#x201C;The intelligent man will&#x2026;isolate himself for the purpose of studying and mediating upon God&#x2019;s law and observing the Lord&#x2019;s precepts&#x2026;His soul will cleave to God and enjoy the fullness of the joy of God&#x2019;s presence&#x2026;&#x201D;(<italic>Yesod Mora</italic>, Chapter 7).</p>
<p>The above came to be known as the practice of <italic>devekut</italic> (cleaving to God). The concept of <italic>devekut</italic> is a prime element in Jewish mystical thought. Rabbi Jehiel Michal of Zlotchov describes the experience of <italic>devekut</italic> as follows: &#x201C;A man&#x2019;s heart should be constantly in dread and awe of God and that the love of God should burn always in his heart&#x2026;All man&#x2019;s psychological faculties [must be devoted to] clear and pure thoughts on God constantly, and in separation from every pleasure&#x201D; (<italic>Derekh Emet</italic> quoted in <italic>Hasidic Prayer</italic> by Louis Jacobs, pp. 20,21). According to the great eighteenth-century kabbalist Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato, <italic>devekut</italic> means &#x201C;directing oneself to God. It means recognizing God every day and finding ways to understand His presence in the world. This could include the study of holy books. This could take the form of prayer or meditation&#x201D; (Gila Nievwenholzon-Gerzoni, <italic>The Works of Unification and Devekut in the Writings of Moshe Chaim Luzzato</italic>, p. 7). It is noteworthy that the Hasidic movement, which would be expected to be critical of Ibn Ezra, actually had a positive attitude toward him. This was because they felt a special affinity for Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s spiritual side. Thus Rabbi Simchah Bunim of Peshischa is reported to have said that he could not understand how Ibn Ezra was able to remain alive here on earth in view of his great piety and fear of God (M.H. Cherez, <italic>Commentary on Ibn Ezra</italic>, Gen. p. 9). The leader of Chabad, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak, reports that it is traditional among the <italic>Chabad Chasidim</italic> to alternate yearly the study of the weekly Torah portions between Rashi and Ibn Ezra, Rashi and Nahmanides, and Rashi and the Or Ha-Chayyim.</p>
<p>Rabbi Pinchus of Koretz greatly loved Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentaries. He argued that Ibn Ezra had the soul of a <italic>tanna</italic>, a teacher of the Mishnah, and hence had the authority to disagree with Rabbinic sages. Rabbi Pinchus was careful to chant Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s Sabbath song, &#x201C;If I keep the Sabbath, God will keep me,&#x201D; every Friday night (Isaac Weiss, <italic>Elef Katav</italic>, Bene Brak, 1997, &#x0023;481).</p>
<h1>SPINOZA</h1>
<p>Baruch Spinoza is considered the father of modem Biblical criticism. Spinoza did not believe that Moses was the author of the Pentateuch. He claimed that Ibn Ezra had a similar belief. Spinoza writes:</p>
<p align="blockquote">In order to treat the subject methodically, I will begin with the received opinions concerning the true authors of the sacred books, and in the first place speak of the author of the Pentateuch, who is almost universally supposed to have been Moses. The Pharisees are so firmly convinced of his identity, that they account as a heretic anyone who differs from them on the subject. Wherefore, Aben Ezra, a man of an enlightened intelligence, and no small learning, who was the first, so far as I know, to treat of this opinion, dared not express his meaning openly, but confined himself to dark hints which I shall not scruple to elucidate, thus throwing full light on the subject (<italic>A Logico-Political treatise</italic>, Chapter 7).</p>
<p>Was Spinoza correct?</p>
<p>In his commentary on the Pentateuch, I.E. hints that there are verses or parts of verses in the Pentateuch which are post-Mosaic. Thus in commenting on <italic>And the Canaanite was then in the land</italic> (Gen. 12:6), which implies that the Canaanites were no longer in the land when this part of the verse was written, I.E. notes, &#x201C;It is possible that the Canaanites seized the land from some other tribe at that time. Should this interpretation be incorrect, then there is a secret meaning to the text. Let the one who understands it remain silent.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Commenting on Deut. 1:1, Ibn Ezra writes, &#x201C;If you will understand the secret of the twelve, and of <italic>And Moses wrote</italic> (Deut. 31:22); <italic>And the Canaanite was then in the land</italic> (Gen. 12:6); <italic>as it is said to this day. In the mount where the Lord is seen</italic> (Gen. 22:14); and <italic>behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron</italic> (Deut. 3:11), you will recognize the truth [concerning the first five verses of Deuteronomy as well].&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s point is that the last twelve verses of Deuteronomy, which describe the death of Moses, were not written by Moses. The same applies to Deut. 3:11, for Moses would not say, <italic>behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron</italic>; <italic>is it not in Rabbah of the children of Amon</italic>, to the Israelites of his generation, for he had no need to tell the people of his generation that Og&#x2019;s great height could be verified by the size of his bed. The people whom Moses was addressing were the very ones who fought against Og. They knew of Og&#x2019;s height. Hence this verse must have been written some time after Moses&#x2019; generation had passed away. I.E. similarly believed that <italic>as it is said to this day: In the mount where the Lord is seen</italic> was not written by Moses, for Mount Moriah was not a place of pilgrimage in the days of Moses. Ibn Ezra argues that just as these words were not written by Moses, neither were the first five verses in Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>According to Talmudic tradition the entire Pentateuch was written by Moses (<italic>Baba Batra</italic> 15a). According to the eighth and ninth of Maimonides&#x2019; thirteen principles of Judaism, a Jew is obligated to believe that the entire Torah which we now possess was given by God to Moses, that this Torah was dictated by God to Moses, and that nothing is to be added to it or subtracted from it (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, Commentary on the Mishnah, Introduction to Chapter 11). Despite this, there are Rabbinic precedents for Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s assertion that the Torah contains post-Mosaic glosses. Some sages are of the opinion that the last eight verses of Deuteronomy were added to the Pentateuch by Joshua (<italic>Baba Batra</italic> 15a). Furthermore, Rabbinic literature speaks of <italic>tikkune soferim</italic>, editorial changes in the <italic>Torah</italic> made by the scribes.</p>
<p>We thus read in <italic>the Midrash Beresheth Rabba</italic> 49:12: &#x201C;<italic>And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the Lord</italic> (Gen. 18:22). Rabbi Simon said: This is a scribal emendation (<italic>tikkun soferim</italic>), for the Divine presence waited for Abraham.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In other words, the original reading of the text was claimed to be: And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom; but the Lord stood yet before Abraham. However, out of respect for God the scribes changed the text so that our Bible reads: <italic>but Abraham stood yet before the Lord</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Midrash Tanchumah, Beshalach</italic> 16 states that the original reading of <italic>And if Thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in Thy sight; and let me not look upon my wretchedness</italic> (Num. 11:15) was: And if Thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in Thy sight; and let me not see Thy (God&#x2019;s) wretchedness.</p>
<p><italic>Midrash Tanchumah, Beshalach</italic> 16 similarly states that the original reading of <italic>one&#x2026;of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother&#x2019;s womb</italic> (Num. 12:12) was, half of <bold>our</bold> flesh was consumed when <bold>we</bold> cometh out of <bold>our</bold> mother&#x2019;s womb.</p>
<p>According to <italic>Tanchumah, Beshalach</italic> 16, the men of the Great Assembly were responsible for the <italic>tikkune soferim</italic>. Some scholars cite other Rabbinic sources that credit Ezra with these textual changes (<italic>tikkune soferim</italic>) (Marc Shapiro, <italic>Torah U-Maddah Journal</italic>, Vol. 4, 1993, p. 199).</p>
<p>It should also be noted that I.E. was not the only medieval rabbi who believed that there are some glosses or slight changes in the text of the Torah. Thus Rabbi David Kimchi (c. 1160-1235) notes that the word Dan in Gen. 14:14 is post-Mosaic. He argues that the original reading of Gen. 14:14 was &#x201C;and pursued as far as Leshem.&#x201D; Rabbi Kimchi maintains that after the tribe of Dan conquered the city of Leshem and changed its name to Dan (Josh. 19:47), the reading of Gen. 14:14 was changed to read &#x201C;and pursued as far as Dan&#x201D; as in our texts of Scripture (Radak on Gen. 14:14).</p>
<p>Others went much further than I.E. Rabbi Judah Ha-Hasid of Regensburg (d. 1217), the author of the <italic>Sefer Hasidim</italic> and one of the Tosafists, believes that the clause <italic>And he set Ephraim before Manasseh</italic> (Gen. 48:20) is not Mosiac. He believes that it was inserted in the verse by Joshua or by a member of the Great Assembly. According to Rabbi Judah the meaning of <italic>And he set Ephraim before Manasseh</italic> is not that Jacob set Ephraim before Manasseh but that Moses placed Ephraim before Manasseh when they marched in the wilderness (Num. 10:22,23). (See Ben Zion Katz, <italic>Jewish Bible Quarterly</italic>, Vol. 25, No. 1, 1997, p. 23).</p>
<p>Rabbi Judah believes that Psalm 136 originally followed Num. 21:18 and that King David removed it from the Book of Numbers and inserted it into Psalms. He similarly believes that David removed all other anonymous psalms composed by Moses from the &#x201C;Chumash (Pentateuch)&#x201D; and placed them in the Book of Psalms [<italic>Ibid.</italic>, p. 26; see also Israel Ta Shema in <italic>Ma-she-hu Al Bikkoret Ha-Mikra Be-Ashkenaz Be-yeme Ha-Benayim</italic>, in <italic>The Bible in The Light of Its Interpreters</italic> (Hebrew), Jerusalem, 1994].</p>
<p>Rabbi Judah also believes that the men of the Great Assembly inserted verses 31-39 into Chapter 36 of Genesis (Katz, p. 29). It should be noted that I.E. suggested that a commentary containing a similar comment be burned. (See I.E. on Gen. 36:31, Vol. 1, p. 341).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Maimonides&#x2019; position on the text of the Pentateuch did not prevent him from charging his son not to spend time on any other commentaries save those of Ibn Ezra, &#x201C;which alone are meaningful and profitable to all who study them with intelligence, understanding and deep insight.&#x201D; (I.E., Vol. 1, Preface, p. VIII). (However, there are those who believe that Maimonides&#x2019; charge to his son is apocryphal.) Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s position on post-mosaic glosses in the Pentateuch did not prevent Rabbi Maimonides&#x2019; son from studying Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s works and constantly quoting him in his commentary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rabbi David Ha-Nagid, a direct descendant of Maimonides, asked Rabbi Joseph ben Eliezer (fourteenth century) to explain to him the secrets at which Ibn Ezra hints. In explaining Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s position on post-Mosaic glosses in the Torah, Rabbi Joseph writes: &#x201C;Since we must believe in tradition and in the words of prophecy what difference does it make to me whether Moses wrote it or another prophet wrote it since it is all true and it is prophetic. If you say, does not the Torah state, <italic>Ye shall not add</italic> [<italic>unto the word which I command you</italic>] (Deut. 4:2), the answer is: Rabbi Abraham [Ibn Ezra] wrote&#x2026;that words are like bodies and their meanings are like souls&#x2026;(Ex. 20:1). Furthermore, <italic>Ye shall not add</italic> only applies to the commandments&#x2026;not to words. (<italic>Tzoffnat Pane&#x2019;ach</italic>) on Gen. 12:6 as quoted by M.E. Stem, <italic>Kokheve Ya&#x2019;akov</italic>, No. 27, Vienna, 1862, pp. 33,34).</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that Nachmanides, who often took issue with I.E. and who believed that the text of the Torah preceded the creation of the world (see C.B. Chavel, <italic>Nachmanides&#x2019; Introduction to the Pentateuch</italic>, 1959, p. 2), never condemned I.E.&#x2019;s hints of post-Mosaic writings in the Torah.</p>
<p>Normative orthodoxy ultimately accepted Maimonides&#x2019; opinion. They argued that the <italic>tikkune soferim</italic> do not refer to actual changes in the text of the Bible. They claim that what the midrash means by <italic>tikkune soferim</italic> is that Moses employed euphemisms (Rabbi Joseph Albo, <italic>Sefer Ha-Ikkarim</italic>, translated by I. Husik, Philadelphia, 1930, Vol. 3, pp. 189-200). Thus Rabbi Shabbatai Bass (1641-1718) quotes Rabbi Solomon ben Adrat (1235-1319) as saying that the term <italic>tikkune soferim</italic> &#x201C;does not, God forbid, intend to teach that they [the scribes] added or addended even one letter to Scripture&#x201D; (<italic>Sifte Chachamim</italic> on Gen. 18:22). Rabbi Joseph Albo stated the same (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>It should be noted that I.E. himself did not believe that there were any <italic>tikkune soferim</italic> in Scripture. However, he based his opinion on exegetical grounds. He wrote, &#x201C;one who correctly interprets the Torah does not need to assume any scribal emendations (<italic>tikunne soferim</italic>)&#x201D; (I.E., Vol. I, Introduction, p. 18).</p>
<p>Contemporary orthodox authorities claim that citations in I.E., Radak, Rabbi Judah Ha-Hasid, and others are misinterpretations, forgeries, or glosses inserted in the commentaries by erring students (see Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, <italic>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayyim</italic>, Part 4, Bene Berak, 1981, pp. 358-361). They believe that the whole issue should be ignored.</p>
<p>While it is true that one can argue that I.E. opened the door to biblical criticism by going somewhat further than the Talmud, it is a far cry from I.E., who added some six small emendations to those of the Talmud and Midrash, to Spinoza and to biblical criticism that questions the entire Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. Spinoza and his followers totally misrepresented the views of I.E.</p>
<p>Others projected their own conflicts onto Ibn Ezra. Thus Zalmen Shazar, the late president of Israel, claimed that Ibn Ezra led a double life, putting on a facade of piety while secretly harboring doubts with regard to certain elements in the Rabbinic tradition. Shazar, like Spinoza, considered Ibn Ezra to have been one of the forerunners of modern biblical criticism. He believed that Ibn Ezra suffered great emotional stress because he could not openly express his beliefs. Shazar hints that Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s cynicism can be traced to this inner conflict. (M. Soloweitschik and S. Rubasscheffs, <italic>Toledot Bikoret HaMikra</italic>, Berlin, 1935, pp. 42-50).</p>
<p>Abraham Geiger had a similar notion. Anticipating Freud, he claimed that Ibn Ezra often poured invective on heretics because deep down he agreed with them (I.E. Twersky, <italic>Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra, Studies in the Writings of a Twelfth-Century Jewish Polymath</italic>, p. 139).</p>
<p>Michael Creizenbach (1789-1842) of Frankfurt, a nineteenthcentury Reform rabbi and Ibn Ezra scholar, considered Ibn Ezra a kindred spirit and a precursor of Reform Judaism (Twersky, <italic>Ibid.</italic>, p. 136).</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that Ibn Ezra was a pious and believing Jew. In fact, Ibn Ezra taught that if faith is lacking, religious practice is meaningless. He emphasized that the Rabbinic tradition is true and is to be followed. What he did was to show us that we should place Rabbinic interpretation and the plain reading of the text in their proper prospective. Ibn Ezra was no more responsible for the misinterpretation of his work than the prophet Isaiah was for the Christian misinterpretation of Is: 7:14.</p>
<p>Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai compared his student Rabbi Eleazar ben Arakh to a flowing spring (<italic>Avot</italic> 2:11). The same may be said of Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra. He has been a fount of learning and a source of intellectual inspiration from the twelfth century to our own day. There is no doubt that he will do the same for coming generations.</p>

<h1>DEVARIM</h1>
<p align="blockquote">In the name of the one who speaks righteousness</p>
<p align="blockquote">and declares things that are right<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">I will explain the Torah portion which begins</p>
<p align="blockquote">with <italic>These Are The Words</italic>.</p>
<p>Some say that the meaning of <italic>eleven days&#x2019; journey from Horeb&#x2026;by the way of mount Seir</italic> (v. 2) is: Look. They traveled for forty years in the wilderness.<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>And it came to pass in the fortieth year</italic> (v. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> However, they err, for Israel came up to Kadesh-barnea in the second year.<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> Actually, <italic>And it came to pass in the fortieth year</italic> is connected to <italic>that Moses spoke</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> (v. 3).</p>
<p>I believe that <italic>These are the words</italic> (v. 1) refers to the precepts recorded in the Torah portions <italic>Re&#x2019;ah Anokhi</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> <italic>Shoftim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> <italic>Ki Tetze</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> and <italic>Ve-hayah Ki Tavo</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> which were already spoken by Moses when they were in the wilderness. <italic>Moses spoke</italic> (v. 1) should be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> This means Moses spoke,<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> in the wilderness, in the Arabah, and in Suph from the day that they journeyed from Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>1. BETWEEN PARAN AND TOPHEL, AND LABAN, AND HAZEROTH, AND DI-ZAHAB. Places not mentioned in the Torah portion <italic>These Are the Stages</italic><sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> (Num. 33:1). On the other hand, they might have been mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> under other names, for, observe, Senir<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup> has three names.<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> There are many other such instances.</p>
<p>2. IT IS ELEVEN DAYS&#x2019; JOURNEY. This means that Moses spoke these things<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> in those eleven days.</p>
<p>FROM HOREB. That they went from Horeb to Kadeshbarnea. I have already told<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> you that the spies went out from Kadesh-barnea. After God swore that they would not enter the land,<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup> no new commandment was given to them.<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> No new commandment was revealed until the fortieth year. We find the aforementioned to be so.<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> <italic>Took Moses upon him to expound this law</italic> (v. 5) is proof of this. Moses expounded the laws<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> which he had stated between Paran and Tophel, for most of the commandments are in this book.<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> <italic>According unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them</italic> (v. 3), refers to the precepts given <italic>beyond the Jordan; in the wilderness, in the Arabah</italic> (v. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>If you understand the secret of the twelve<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> and also that of <italic>So Moses wrote</italic> (Deut. 31:22);<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> <italic>And the Canaanite was then in the Land</italic> (Gen. 12:6);<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> <italic>In the mount where the Lord is seen</italic> (Gen. 22:14);<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> and <italic>behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron</italic> (Deut. 3:11);<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> then you will recognize the truth.<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that Moses died on the first day of Shevat.<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup> Scripture states that Israel mourned thirty days (Deut. 34:8). They spent six Sabbaths there.<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> They offer proof from <italic>that selfsame day</italic> (Deut. 32:48), i.e., that Moses read this book before all of Israel in one day and then died on that very day.<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> However, this is no proof, for <italic>that selfsame day</italic> refers to the song.<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> Look&#x0021; Scripture states, <italic>thou art to pass over the Jordan this day</italic> (Deut. 9:1).<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. IN THE ELEVENTH MONTH. I have explained the meaning of <italic>ashte asar</italic> (eleven) in my comments on the Torah portion <italic>Nasso</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. TOOK MOSES UPON HIM TO EXPLAIN. <italic>Ho&#x2019;il</italic> (took upon himself) and <italic>be&#x2019;er</italic> (to explain) are two verbs in the perfect attached to each other without a connective <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup> We find the same in <italic>chamak avar</italic> (had turned away, and was gone) (Cant. 5:6).</p>
<p>Look&#x0021; Moses began to explain to the children who were born in the wilderness what happened to their fathers. He related to them all the commandments. They would also hear from the mouth of the faithful messenger the Ten Statements which their fathers heard from God.</p>
<p>6. HOREB. This is Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup> as I have previously noted.</p>
<p>7. TURN YOU. Leave this place.</p>
<p>AND TAKE YOUR JOURNEY. It is the style of Scripture to say, <italic>u-se&#x2019;u lakhem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> (and take your journey). Compare, <italic>lekh lekha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup> (get thee out) (Gen.2:1).</p>
<p>9. I AM NOT ABLE TO BEAR YOU MYSELF ALONE. Its meaning is similar to <italic>thou art not able to perform it alone</italic> (Ex. 18:18).<sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. HATH MULTIPLIED YOU. In Egypt, and the blessing which your father blessed you was fulfilled.</p>
<p>[AS THE STARS OF HEAVEN.] This is a metaphor.</p>
<p>[11. A THOUSAND TIMES.] The word <italic>pe&#x2019;amim</italic> (times) comes with <italic>elef</italic> (a thousand)<sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup> and with <italic>me&#x2019;ah</italic> (a hundred).<sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> The reverse is the case in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. YOUR CUMBRANCE. <italic>Torchakhem</italic> (your cumbrance) is related to the word <italic>torach</italic> (burden) in <italic>They are a burden unto me</italic> (Is. 1:14).<sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup> <italic>Your cumbrance</italic> refers to teaching the commandments to the simple.</p>
<p>AND YOUR BURDEN. They demanded bread, water, and meat. Compare, <italic>that Thou layest the burden of all this people upon me</italic> (Num. 11:11).</p>
<p>AND YOUR STRIFE. One with another.</p>
<p>13. GET YOU. The word <italic>havu</italic> (get) is irregular. Its <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup> should have been vocalized with a <italic>sheva na</italic> and a <italic>pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND FULL OF KNOWLEDGE.<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> Men who were known, men whom all recognized.</p>
<p>15. CAPTAINS OF THOUSANDS. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. HEAR. <italic>Shamo&#x2019;a</italic> (hear) is an infinitive. It is like the word <italic>zakhor</italic> (remember) in <italic>Remember the sabbath day</italic> (Ex. 20:8).<sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup> <italic>Shamo&#x2019;a</italic> is short for <italic>shamo&#x2019;a shimu</italic> (you shall surely hear) or <italic>shimu shamo&#x2019;a</italic> (you shall surely hear).<sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE STRANGER THAT IS WITH HIM. I have already explained the meaning of the term <italic>ger</italic> (stranger).<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. RESPECT PERSONS IN JUDGMENT.<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup> To force judgment in favor of the person whom he [the judge] recognizes.</p>
<p>18. WHICH YE SHOULD DO. The reference is to the statutes and laws which he [Moses] taught them.</p>
<p>19. ALL THAT GREAT AND DREADFUL WILDERNESS. This is what the <italic>eleven day&#x2019;s journey</italic> (v. 2) refers to.</p>
<p>[THE HILL-COUNTRY OF THE AMORITES.<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup>] For Scripture states, [<italic>And the Amorites, that dwell in that hill-country, came out against you&#x2026;</italic>] <italic>and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah</italic> (Deut. 1:44).<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup> This<sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup> means that we should go out toward the hill country of the Amorites.<sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. TAKE POSSESSION. <italic>Resh</italic> (take possession) is vocalized like the word <italic>shev</italic> (sit).<sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup> <italic>Resh</italic> is related to the word <italic>yerushah</italic> (possession).</p>
<p>DISMAYED. <italic>Techat</italic> (dismayed) is similar<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup> to the word <italic>yiddal</italic> (shall be made thin) in <italic>That the glory of Jacob shall be made thin</italic> (Is. 17:4).<sup><xref rid="fn60">60</xref></sup> <italic>Techat</italic> comes from a double root.</p>
<p>22. THAT THEY MAY SEARCH THE LAND FOR US. <italic>Veyachperu</italic> (that they may search) is similar<sup><xref rid="fn61">61</xref></sup> to <italic>la-chepo</italic>r (to search out) in <italic>to search out all the land</italic> (Josh. 2:3). One who digs (<italic>chofer</italic>) searches for that which is hidden.<sup><xref rid="fn62">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>BY WHICH WE MUST GO UP. At first.<sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND THE THING PLEASED ME WELL. Because you all assented to this.</p>
<p>25. AND BROUGHT IT DOWN. Moses said this because of the height of the tree.<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup> Actually, however, he said this because they<sup><xref rid="fn65">65</xref></sup> were in the south.<sup><xref rid="fn66">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND YE MURMURED. <italic>Va-teragenu</italic> (and ye murmured) is similar to <italic>rogenim</italic> (murmur) in <italic>And they that murmur shall learn instruction</italic> (Is. 29:24). <italic>Teragenu</italic> (murmured) is in the <italic>nifal</italic>. Compare, <italic>al te&#x2019;atzevu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn67">67</xref></sup> (be not grieved).</p>
<p>29. DREAD NOT. <italic>Lo ta&#x2019;artzun</italic> means dread not. <italic>Ta&#x2019;artzun</italic> is related to the word <italic>ma&#x2019;aritzekhem</italic> (your dread) in <italic>and let him be your dread</italic> (Is. 8:13). It means the breaking of the heart by fear.<sup><xref rid="fn68">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. HE SHALL FIGHT FOR YOU. <italic>Lakhem</italic> means for you.<sup><xref rid="fn69">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. TO PITCH YOUR TENTS. <italic>La-chanotekhem</italic> (to pitch your tents) is not a transitive verb,<sup><xref rid="fn70">70</xref></sup> for we do not find this form to be transitive.</p>
<p>TO SHOW YOU. <italic>La-re&#x2019;otekhem</italic> (to show you) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> to show that the letter <italic>heh</italic>, which is placed before the direct object<sup><xref rid="fn71">71</xref></sup> (<italic>le-hare&#x2019;otekhem</italic>) is missing.</p>
<p>36. SAVE. The <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>zulati</italic> (save) is superfluous, for the word is found without the <italic>yod</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn72">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND TO HIM WILL I GIVE THE LAND THAT HE HATH TRODDEN UPON. The reference is to Hebron.<sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. [ALSO THE LORD WAS ANGRY WITH ME.] I have already shown you<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup> that the <italic>nun</italic> of the word <italic>appo</italic> (his anger) (Gen. 39:19) is swallowed by the <italic>peh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn75">75</xref></sup> However, it is present in the Aramaic.<sup><xref rid="fn76">76</xref></sup> Furthermore, <italic>appo</italic> is also related to the word <italic>anafta</italic><sup><xref rid="fn77">77</xref></sup> (thou was angry) in <italic>For though Thou was angry with me</italic> (Is. 12:1) and <italic>hitannaf</italic> (was angry)<sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup> in <italic>Also the Lord was angry with me</italic>. Moses mentions Caleb first, then Joshua.<sup><xref rid="fn79">79</xref></sup> I have already explained why.<sup><xref rid="fn80">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. WHO STANDETH BEFORE THEE. This is <italic>his minister</italic> (Ex. 24:13; Num. 11:28).<sup><xref rid="fn81">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>39. THAT THIS DAY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE. That day.<sup><xref rid="fn82">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF GOOD OR EVIL. Scripture speaks of the majority.<sup><xref rid="fn83">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. AND DEEMED IT A LIGHT THING. The meaning of <italic>va-tahinu</italic> (and deemed it a light thing) is, and you said behold (<italic>hen</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn84">84</xref></sup> Do not ask how a verb<sup><xref rid="fn85">85</xref></sup> can be derived from a word that is connected to another word,<sup><xref rid="fn86">86</xref></sup> for we find the same with <italic>al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn87">87</xref></sup> The same is true, as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn88">88</xref></sup> of the word <italic>pen</italic> (lest), for we find the word <italic>afunah</italic> (I am distracted) (Ps. 88:16).<sup><xref rid="fn89">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that <italic>va-tahinu</italic> is related to the word <italic>hin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn90">90</xref></sup> Its meaning is a measure.<sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup> However, this is far-fetched.</p>
<p>44. AND THE AMORITES&#x2026;CAME OUT. The reference, as I have explained, is to the Canaanites.<sup><xref rid="fn92">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>AS BEES DO. For they immediately chase after and bite whoever touches their abode.</p>
<p>AND BEAT YOU DOWN. I have explained the meaning of <italic>va-yakketu</italic> (and beat you down).<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>ve-khatoti</italic> (and I will beat to pieces) (Ps. 99:24).<sup><xref rid="fn94">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNTO HORMAH. Hormah is either the name of a place or an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn95">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>46. SO YE ABODE IN KADESH. Kadesh-barnea.<sup><xref rid="fn96">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>MANY DAYS, ACCORDING UNTO THE DAYS THAT YE ABODE THERE. In spying out the land. If one should argue, the spies alone abode there.<sup><xref rid="fn97">97</xref></sup> [The answer is:] Scripture similarly reads, <italic>After the number of days in which ye spied out the land</italic> (Num. 14:34).<sup><xref rid="fn98">98</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Is. 45:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> In other words, the meaning of <italic>eleven days&#x2019; journey from Horeb unto Kadesh-barnea&#x2026;by the way of mount Seir</italic> (v. 2) is, that it took them 40 years to make a journey that normally takes eleven days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> They came to Kadesh-barnea in the fortieth year. Verse 3 explains verse 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> Moses sent out the spies in the second year following the Exodus. He sent out the spies from Kadesh-barnea. See Num. 32:8. It should be noted that Num. 13:3 identifies the place from which the spies departed as the wilderness of Paran. The commentaries explain that Kadesh-barnea is at the edge of the wilderness of Paran. See Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5"><sup>5</sup> Not to Kadesh-barnea.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6"><sup>6</sup> Deut. 11:26&#x2013;16:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn7"><sup>7</sup> Deut. 16:18&#x2013;21:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn8"><sup>8</sup> Deut. 21:10&#x2013;25:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn9"><sup>9</sup> Deut. 26:1&#x2013;29:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn10"><sup>10</sup> Verse 1 is to be interpreted as if written: These are the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel beyond the Jordan. He spoke these words in the wilderness, in the Arabah, etc. He spoke them on the eleven days&#x2019; journey from Horeb unto Kadesh-barnea.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn11"><sup>11</sup> These precepts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn12"><sup>12</sup> I.E. interprets verse 1-3 as follows: These precepts, which Moses recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy beyond the Jordan, were first delivered by Moses in the wilderness between Horeb and Kadesh-barnea.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn13"><sup>13</sup> Wherein Moses records the journeys of the children of Israel in the wilderness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn14"><sup>14</sup> There.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn15"><sup>15</sup> A mountain in northern Israel. See Deut. 3:9</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn16"><sup>16</sup> It is also known as Hermon and Sirion. See Deut. 3:89.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn17"><sup>17</sup> These words of the Torah repeated by Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn18"><sup>18</sup> I.E. is referring to his comments above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn19"><sup>19</sup> See Num. 14:26-38.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn20"><sup>20</sup> See I.E. on Num. 20:1 (Vol. 4, p. 157).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn21"><sup>21</sup> The Torah does not record any commandments or prophetic utterances during this period. See I.E. on Num. 20:1 (Vol. 4, p. 157).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn22"><sup>22</sup> For that is what <italic>this law</italic> refers to.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn23"><sup>23</sup> The Book of Deuteronomy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn24"><sup>24</sup> According to I.E., <italic>Moses spoke&#x2026;</italic> (v. 3) is to be interpreted as: Moses spoke&#x2026; according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them <italic>beyond the Jordan; in the wilderness, in the Arabah</italic>, and in all the other places mentioned earlier in the eleven days&#x2019; journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn25"><sup>25</sup> The last twelve verses of the Torah. According to I.E. the last twelve verses of the Torah were not written by Moses, for they record the death of Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn26"><sup>26</sup> I.E. believes that Moses did not write this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn27"><sup>27</sup> I.E. believes that Moses did not write this verse, for Scripture implies that the Canaanite was then in the land but not at the time that this verse was written. See I.E. on Gen.12:6 and the notes thereto (Vol. 1, p. 151).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn28"><sup>28</sup> The reference is to Mount Moriah. However, in the days of Moses the temple had not yet been built. Thus Moses would not have said, <italic>In the mount where the Lord is seen</italic>. Hence this verse was inserted in the Torah at a later date.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn29"><sup>29</sup> The reference is to the bed of Og, king of Bashan, slain by Moses. I.E. believes that Moses would not have had to prove the height of the king by pointing to his bed, for all of Israel then knew of his height. Hence the verse is post-Mosaic.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn30"><sup>30</sup> That the first five verses of this book were not composed by Moses but at a later period. I.E. hints at the above because he did not want people to generalize and assume that there are other post-Mosaic additions in the Pentateuch. See I.E. on Gen. 36:31, &#x201C;&#x2026;Yitzchaki claims in his book that this chapter was composed during the reign of King Jehosaphat&#x2026;Far be it for one to believe that our chapter was written in the days of Jehosaphat as Yitzchaki maintains. Indeed his book is fit to be burned&#x201D; (Vol. 1, p. 341).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn31"><sup>31</sup> This opinion holds that Moses died on the very day that he explained the Torah to Israel, namely, the first day of Shevat (v. 3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn32"><sup>32</sup> In the land of Moab following the death of Moses. Israel mourned Moses for 30 days (Deut. 34:8). The period of mourning concluded on the first of Adar. Israel crossed the Jordan on the tenth day of Nisan (Josh. 4:19). There are six Sabbaths between the first of Adar and the tenth day of Nisan. It should be noted that some manuscripts read: &#x201C;Some say that Moses died on the first day of Adar. Scripture states that Israel mourned thirty days (Num. 34:8). They spent two Sabbaths there.&#x201D; According to this opinion Moses reviewed the Torah for thirty days, and <italic>that selfsame day</italic> refers to the day that Moses finished reviewing the Torah. If this was the case, then two Sabbaths remained from the end of the period of Moses&#x2019; mourning and the tenth of Nisan. Both of these opinions take issue with Rabbinic tradition, which believes that Moses died on the seventh of Adar. According to Weiser the opinions quoted and rejected by I.E. are those of the Karaites. It is worth noting that I.E. does not quote the Rabbinic opinion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn33"><sup>33</sup> They believe that <italic>that selfsame day</italic> refers to the day that Moses repeated the Torah to all of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn34"><sup>34</sup> The day on which Moses recited the song that opens with the words <italic>ha&#x2019;azinu</italic> (give ear) (Deut. 32:1-43).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn35"><sup>35</sup> Israel did not cross the Jordan on the day that Moses uttered Deut. 9:1, for Scripture tells us that Israel crossed into Canaan after the death of Moses. We thus see that the term &#x201C;that day&#x201D; is not to be taken literally, but means at that time. The same applies to <italic>that selfsame day</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn36"><sup>36</sup> See I.E. on Num. 7:72 (Vol. 4, p. 54).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn37"><sup>37</sup> Two verbs usually are connected with a <italic>vav</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comments. According to I.E., <italic>ho&#x2019;il moshe be&#x2019;er</italic> (took Moses upon himself to expound) is to be explained as if written, <italic>ho&#x2019;il moshe u-ve&#x2019;er</italic> (Moses began and explained).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn38"><sup>38</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary on Ex. 3:1.</ftnote>

<p>5. CONTEND NOT WITH THEM. The word <italic>titgaru</italic> (contend) is similar to the word <italic>yigareh</italic> (strife) in <italic>stirreth up strife</italic> (Prov. 28:25). It means to disturb and err.<sup><xref rid="fn99">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. YE SHALL PURCHASE FOOD OF THEM. If they want to sell.<sup><xref rid="fn100">2</xref></sup> Some say that our clause is to be read as a question. It means that Israel had no need for food and drink in these past years. <italic>For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee</italic> (v. 7) is proof.</p>
<p>9. I HAVE GIVEN AR. Of Moab.<sup><xref rid="fn101">3</xref></sup> It is possible that Sihon took Ar<sup><xref rid="fn102">4</xref></sup> and that it returned to Maob at the end.<sup><xref rid="fn103">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. THE EMIM. I have previously explained the meaning of Emim.<sup><xref rid="fn104">6</xref></sup> Scripture tells us that Moab took Ar from the Emim.</p>
<p>11. REPHAIM. I have previously explained its meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn105">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THE HORITES. They <italic>are the sons of Seir the Horite</italic> (Gen. 36:20).</p>
<p>15. TO DISCOMFIT THEM. <italic>Le-hummam</italic> (to discomfit them) is a <italic>kal</italic>. It comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn106">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. SO IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN ALL THE MEN OF WAR WERE CONSUMED. Our verse is connected to <italic>that the Lord spoke unto me saying</italic> (v. 17).<sup><xref rid="fn107">9</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing</italic> (Deut. 31:24)<sup><xref rid="fn108">10</xref></sup> and <italic>And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spoke</italic> (Ex. 6:28).<sup><xref rid="fn109">11</xref></sup> There are many other such cases. It means,<sup><xref rid="fn110">12</xref></sup> And it came to pass when they<sup><xref rid="fn111">13</xref></sup> were consumed, God said that we are about to pass over the border of Ar.</p>
<p>19. AND WHEN THOU COMEST NIGH OVER AGAINST THE CHILDREN OF AMMON. The meaning of <italic>ve-karavta</italic> is, when you come close to them.<sup><xref rid="fn112">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>HARASS THEM NOT. <italic>Tetzurem</italic> (harass) comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn113">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>NOR CONTEND WITH THEM. <italic>Titgar</italic> (contend) is in the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic>. Its root ends in a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn114">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. ZAMZUMMIM. A foreign term which was Hebraized.<sup><xref rid="fn115">17</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ha-achashdarpenim</italic> (the satraps) (Esth. 8:9).<sup><xref rid="fn116">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. BUT THE LORD DESTROYED THEM. Scripture relates that God destroyed a people on behalf of the Moabites<sup><xref rid="fn117">19</xref></sup> and gave them the land as an inheritance, as he did with Mount Seir on behalf of Esau.</p>
<p>23. [AS FAR AS GAZA.] Scripture reads <italic>as far as Gaza</italic> because Gaza belonged to the Philistines and there already was a covenant between Abraham and Abimelech, namely, <italic>that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son&#x2019;s son</italic> (Gen. 21:23).<sup><xref rid="fn118">20</xref></sup> Scripture relates that the Avvim took Gaza.<sup><xref rid="fn119">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. BEGIN TO POSSESS IT. The word <italic>rash</italic> (possess) comes from the word <italic>yerushah</italic> (possession).<sup><xref rid="fn120">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. OUT OF THE WILDERNESS OF KEDEMOTH. I believe that <italic>the wilderness of Kedemoth</italic> is the same as the place called <italic>the wilderness to Mattanah</italic> (Num. 21:18).</p>
<p>27. THE HIGHWAY. The well-known highway.<sup><xref rid="fn121">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. THOU SHALT SELL ME FOOD FOR MONEY, THAT I MAY EAT. If I need to.<sup><xref rid="fn122">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AS THE CHILDREN OF ESAU&#x2026;AND THE MOABITES THAT DWELL IN AR DID UNTO ME. Some say that <italic>did unto me</italic> refers to <italic>thou shalt sell me food for money</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn123">25</xref></sup> If this is so, then what will they do with the inhabitants of Ar who were Moabites,<sup><xref rid="fn124">26</xref></sup> about whom Scripture writes, <italic>because they met you not with bread and with water in the way</italic> (Deut. 23:5)?<sup><xref rid="fn125">27</xref></sup> They were compelled to offer this interpretation<sup><xref rid="fn126">28</xref></sup> because the king of the Edomites said, <italic>Thou shalt not pass through me</italic> (Ex. 20:18).</p>
<p>I believe that Israel&#x2019;s request refers to, <italic>I will go along by the highway</italic> (v. 27)<sup><xref rid="fn127">29</xref></sup> as the children of Esau did, for Israel went around Mount Seir by the highway. Indeed, Scripture reads, <italic>Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir</italic> (v. 4). However, the king, that is, the king of Edom, did not allow them to pass through his country, which was near Canaan. Israel therefore passed by Ar, as Scripture records (v. 18).</p>
<p>Others say that they<sup><xref rid="fn128">30</xref></sup> did not meet the Israelites<sup><xref rid="fn129">31</xref></sup> but the Israelites bought<sup><xref rid="fn130">32</xref></sup> from them.</p>
<p>31. I HAVE BEGUN. The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>hachilloti</italic> (I have begun), which is the <italic>heh</italic> of the form,<sup><xref rid="fn131">33</xref></sup> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn132">34</xref></sup> because of the guttural.<sup><xref rid="fn133">35</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ha&#x2019;irotihu</italic> (roused him)<sup><xref rid="fn134">36</xref></sup> in <italic>I have roused him up in victory</italic> (Is. 45:13).</p>
<p>33. AND WE SMOTE. The root <italic>nun</italic> is missing in the word <italic>va-nakh</italic> (and we smote).<sup><xref rid="fn135">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. THE MEN. <italic>Metim</italic> (men) means people.</p>
<p>36. TOO HIGH. <italic>Sagevah</italic> (too high) is related to the word <italic>venisgav</italic> (shall be exalted) in <italic>And the Lord alone shall be exalted</italic> (Is. 2:11).</p>
<p>37. TO THE LAND OF THE CHILDREN OF AMMON. Which, as I have noted,<sup><xref rid="fn136">38</xref></sup> is today in their hands.</p>
<p>ALL THE SIDE. The word <italic>yad</italic> (side) means place.<sup><xref rid="fn137">39</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>yad</italic> (side) in <italic>by the side of the Jordan</italic> (Num. 13:29).</p>
<ftnote id="fn99"><sup>1</sup> Strife is caused by disturbance and distance from that which is normal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn100"><sup>2</sup> We will not demand that they sell food to us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn101"><sup>3</sup> Ar is a Moabite city (Num. 21:28).</ftnote>

<p>24. THOU HAST BEGUN. The wisest of the wise<sup><xref rid="fn161">24</xref></sup> said: <italic>Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness</italic>, in heaven and on earth,<sup><xref rid="fn162">25</xref></sup> i.e., the manner in which You conduct the world.</p>
<p>AND THY STRONG HAND. Via the signs performed through Moses so that the world learned that there is no God but the Lord. The meaning of <italic>El</italic><sup><xref rid="fn163">26</xref></sup> (God) is mighty.</p>
<p>IN HEAVEN. Wherein are the angels and the hosts.<sup><xref rid="fn164">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR ON EARTH. Wherein are the beasts and human beings.</p>
<p>ACCORDING TO THY WORKS. All of which are governed by wisdom.</p>
<p>MIGHTY. In ability.<sup><xref rid="fn165">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>This section was written to instill a love of the Land of Israel. If they love the land, they will observe God&#x2019;s commandments so that they will not be exiled from the land.</p>
<p>27. GET THEE UP INTO THE TOP OF PISGAH. The reference is to the valley that is in the field of Moab, the top of Pisgah.<sup><xref rid="fn166">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. SO WE ABODE IN THE VALLEY. The meaning is, and we had already stayed in this valley, which is the top of Pisgah,<sup><xref rid="fn167">30</xref></sup> for from there<sup><xref rid="fn168">31</xref></sup> they journeyed to the plains of Moab.<sup><xref rid="fn169">32</xref></sup> The valley is in the mountains of Abarim, for the latter is clearly stated.<sup><xref rid="fn170">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses now commenced to speak about the commandments. He began with idol worship because they were near Bethpeor.<sup><xref rid="fn171">34</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn138"><sup>1</sup> Hebrew, <italic>hishir</italic> (he [Israel] left him).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn139"><sup>2</sup> <italic>Hishir</italic> (none was left) is in the singular. Thus our verse literally reads, and we smote him until he left him with no one remaining. I.E. renders this, and we smote him until each one of the Israelites left him no one standing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn140"><sup>3</sup> Onkelos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn141"><sup>4</sup> Onkelos renders <italic>chevel</italic> as <italic>tarchona</italic>, i.e., Trachonites. Trachonites is a district on the Golan heights.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn142"><sup>5</sup> They render <italic>chevel</italic> Argob as the district of clods.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn143"><sup>6</sup> Og was double the size of a normal person. I Sam. 17:4 tells us that Goliath&#x2019;s height was six cubits and a span. This is about twice the height of a normal person. Goliath was of the Rephaim (I Chron. 20: 4-8), as was Og. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s reasoning (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn144"><sup>7</sup> According to Rashi, Scripture speaks of Og&#x2019;s cubit when it describes his bed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn145"><sup>8</sup> Since we do not know Og&#x2019;s span, Scripture&#x2019;s statement that Og&#x2019;s bed was nine cubits long and four cubits wide is meaningless.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn146"><sup>9</sup> If we assume that Og&#x2019;s span was twice that of a normal person, then his bed indicates that Og&#x2019;s dimensions were way beyond that of a human being. I.E. did not believe that such giants existed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn147"><sup>10</sup> See I.E. on Num. 32:41 (Vol. 4, p. 254).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn148"><sup>11</sup> It means to the children of Machir. See I.E. on Num. 32:40 (Vol. 4, p. 254).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn150"><sup>13</sup> Literally, and border.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn151"><sup>14</sup> According to I.E. our clause should be rendered, the middle of the valley and its border.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn152"><sup>15</sup> Literally, the Jordan and boundary. I.E. believes that this should be rendered, the Jordan and its boundary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn153"><sup>16</sup> Even though he was addressing all the Israelites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn154"><sup>17</sup> Since Moses spoke to Israel, he should have used the term them when referring to Reuben and Gad.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn157"><sup>20</sup> When he said, <italic>For I know thy rebellion&#x2026;</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn158"><sup>21</sup> The point is that some of what Moses said when he spoke to the Levites was directed specifically at the Levites, but the rest was directed to all of Israel. Moses could address Israel while speaking to the Levites because the Levites are part of Israel.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 4</title>
<p>1. WHICH I TEACH YOU, TO DO THEM. The main purpose of study is the observance of the commandments.</p>
<p>THAT YE MAY LIVE. For those who worshipped <italic>pe&#x2019;or</italic> were destroyed.<sup><xref rid="fn172">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND POSSESS. The middle root letter of the verb <italic>vi-yerishtem</italic> (and possess)<sup><xref rid="fn173">2</xref></sup> is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> because the <italic>yod</italic> is silenced and made invisible by the <italic>chirik</italic> beneath the <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn174">3</xref></sup> There is no other word that is similarly vocalized.</p>
<p>2. YE SHALL NOT ADD. On your own<sup><xref rid="fn175">4</xref></sup> and think that it is in the service of God. You shall similarly not diminish.<sup><xref rid="fn176">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, my<sup><xref rid="fn177">6</xref></sup> statement <italic>that ye may live</italic> does not require witnesses, for <italic>Your eyes have seen&#x2026;</italic> (v. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn178">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. IN BAAL-PEOR. <italic>Be-va&#x2019;al pe&#x2019;or</italic> (in Baal-peor) means because of Baal-peor.<sup><xref rid="fn179">8</xref></sup> There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn180">9</xref></sup> Whoever did not worship Baal-peor is alive.</p>
<p>5. [I HAVE TAUGHT YOU.] Moses states, <italic>I have taught you</italic>, after saying <italic>which I teach you</italic> (v. 1), because he wants to add, <italic>even as the Lord my God commanded me</italic>. The meaning of our verse is, the precepts which I taught you are God&#x2019;s commandments, which you should observe in the land that God will give you for a possession. Furthermore, the commandments are your glory over the nations.</p>
<p>[6. YOUR WISDOM AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING IN THE SIGHT OF THE PEOPLES.] Because an intelligent person can understand the basis of all the commandments. An intelligent person can ascertain the reason why they were given.</p>
<p>7. FOR WHAT GREAT NATION IS THERE. That has God so near in that He always answers him in all that he intelligently<sup><xref rid="fn181">10</xref></sup> requests of Him. Furthermore, unlike Israel there is no great nation that has statutes and ordinances that reason tells us are righteous.</p>
<p>A great nation means, great in intelligent people who fear the Lord.</p>
<p>9. ONLY TAKE HEED TO THYSELF. Its meaning is, should you forget everything, do not forget the day that you stood at Sinai.</p>
<p>WHICH THINE EYES SAW. The reference is to <italic>And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings</italic> (Ex. 20:15).</p>
<p>10. [ALL THE DAYS THAT THEY LIVE UPON THE EARTH.] Scripture says this because God knows that they can not properly observe His commandments when they are in countries where others rule over them.<sup><xref rid="fn182">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. UNTO THE HEART OF HEAVEN. The middle of heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn183">12</xref></sup> Scripture speaks of those who look up. <italic>The heart of the sea</italic> (Ex. 15:8) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn184">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. ONLY A VOICE. Which you heard,<sup><xref rid="fn185">14</xref></sup> for the voice is not visible to the eye.<sup><xref rid="fn186">15</xref></sup> I have already explained the meaning of <italic>And all the people saw the sounds</italic><sup><xref rid="fn187">16</xref></sup> (Ex. 20:15).<sup><xref rid="fn188">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. [COMMANDED ME AT THAT TIME.] For God told Moses all the statutes and ordinances at Sinai. However, Moses related them to Israel in the second year<sup><xref rid="fn189">18</xref></sup> and again in the fortieth year.<sup><xref rid="fn190">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>[Moses tells the Israelites:] Since <italic>you saw no form</italic> (v. 12) <italic>take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves</italic> (v. 15) lest you corrapt what you saw (v. 16), that is, lest you corrupt the truth<sup><xref rid="fn191">20</xref></sup> or your ways.<sup><xref rid="fn192">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. A GRAVEN IMAGE. The word <italic>pesel</italic> (graven image) refers to an object that has been fashioned.<sup><xref rid="fn193">22</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>va-yifselu</italic> (did fashion) in <italic>And Solomon&#x2019;s builders&#x2026;did fashion them</italic> (I Kings 5:32).</p>
<p>MALE OR FEMALE. Worshipped by some well-known nations. There are also nations that bow down and worship any beast that they meet at the beginning of their day in order to bring down a power from on high; for example, they worship the scorpion<sup><xref rid="fn194">23</xref></sup> if they want someone bitten. The same applies to the remaining forty-seven forms.<sup><xref rid="fn195">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THE SUN AND THE MOON. Which are the great lights.<sup><xref rid="fn196">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>After mentioning the stars, Scripture goes on to use a general term, namely, <italic>even all the host of heaven. All the hosts of heaven</italic> refers to the planets,<sup><xref rid="fn197">26</xref></sup> which are light-giving stars, and all the constellations and forms.<sup><xref rid="fn198">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU BE DRAWN AWAY.<sup><xref rid="fn199">28</xref></sup> You will, as it were, slip and fall.</p>
<p>WHICH THE LORD THY GOD HATH ALLOTTED. It has been empirically established that each and every nation has a specific star and constellation. Every city similarly has its own constellation. God raised Israel to a very high level in that God, and not any star, is Israel&#x2019;s guide.<sup><xref rid="fn200">29</xref></sup> Israel is thus God&#x2019;s portion.</p>
<p>21. [NOW THE LORD WAS ANGERED WITH ME.] Moses says this because he had stated earlier, <italic>But you hath the Lord taken and brought forth&#x2026;to be unto Him a people of inheritance</italic> (v. 20) in the land, so that you will serve Him. However, I will not share in this good.</p>
<p>FOR YOUR SAKES. You were the cause of my not entering the land. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn201">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. TAKE HEED UNTO YOURSELVES&#x2026;AND MAKE YOU A GRAVEN IMAGE. Moses had previously said something to this effect.<sup><xref rid="fn202">31</xref></sup> He repeated himself because he wanted to add, <italic>For the Lord thy God is a devouring fire</italic> (v. 24). Hence<sup><xref rid="fn203">32</xref></sup> I command you to [<italic>take heed unto yourselves</italic>&#x2026;].</p>
<p>EVEN THE LIKENESS OF ANY THING. <italic>Temunat kol</italic><sup><xref rid="fn204">33</xref></sup> is to be rendered as the likeness of anything.<sup><xref rid="fn205">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHICH THE LORD THY GOD HATH FORBIDDEN THEE. <italic>Asher tzivvekha</italic> (hath forbidden thee) is to be rendered as He commanded thee.<sup><xref rid="fn206">35</xref></sup> Or <italic>tzivvekha</italic> may be interpreted: which He commanded you not to make.<sup><xref rid="fn207">36</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>I will also command</italic> (atzavveh) <italic>the clouds</italic> (from raining rain upon it)<sup><xref rid="fn208">37</xref></sup> (Is. 5:6).<sup><xref rid="fn209">38</xref></sup> Some say that the reference<sup><xref rid="fn210">39</xref></sup> is to the likeness of the stars.<sup><xref rid="fn211">40</xref></sup> However, this appears to me to be far-fetched.</p>
<p>24. A DEVOURING FIRE. There is no <italic>kaf</italic> with the meaning of like prefixed to the word <italic>esh</italic> (fire). The meaning of <italic>esh okhlah hu</italic> (a devouring fire) is, like a devouring fire.<sup><xref rid="fn212">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>A JEALOUS GOD. With regard to idol worship. His jealousy devours like fire, which does not leave root or branch.</p>
<p>25. WHEN THOU SHALT BEGET CHILDREN. Moses first tells the Israelites that the Lord God is a jealous God. He then tells them what will happen to them if they make an image.</p>
<p>AND YOU SHALL DEAL CORRUPTLY. With regard to the rest of the commandments such as to murder or to commit adultery.</p>
<p>26. I CALL HEAVEN AND EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU THIS DAY. Some say the witness of heaven and earth refers to the angels and the human beings.<sup><xref rid="fn213">42</xref></sup> Others say that the reference is to the rain, as in <italic>and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass</italic><sup><xref rid="fn214">43</xref></sup> (Lev. 26:19). However, it appears to me that heaven and earth are witnesses, and the Israelites and their children will always see them, for they are everlasting, as in <italic>as the days of the heavens above the earth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn215">44</xref></sup> (Deut. 11:21). <italic>Hear, O ye mountains, the Lord&#x2019;s controversy</italic> (Micah 6:2); and <italic>Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us</italic> (Josh. 24:27) are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn216">45</xref></sup> Should one dispute this on the basis of <italic>For the heavens shall vanish like smoke</italic><sup><xref rid="fn217">46</xref></sup> (Is. 51:6) and the like,<sup><xref rid="fn218">47</xref></sup> [then I respond] the one who makes this argument is awake but his heart sleeps.<sup><xref rid="fn219">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>YE SHALL SOON UTTERLY PERISH. The word <italic>tovedun</italic> (ye shall utterly perish)<sup><xref rid="fn220">49</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>tilmedun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn221">50</xref></sup> (that you may teach).<sup><xref rid="fn222">51</xref></sup> The word<sup><xref rid="fn223">52</xref></sup> is so vocalized<sup><xref rid="fn224">53</xref></sup> because it is not in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn225">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. FEW IN NUMBER. I have already explained the meaning of <italic>mete</italic> (few).<sup><xref rid="fn226">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. WHICH NEITHER SEE, NOR HEAR. Scripture mentions the four senses.<sup><xref rid="fn227">56</xref></sup> It is unnecessary to mention the fifth<sup><xref rid="fn228">57</xref></sup> because it is thicker<sup><xref rid="fn229">58</xref></sup> than the others.<sup><xref rid="fn230">59</xref></sup> Furthermore, it is the root of the life of the body.<sup><xref rid="fn231">60</xref></sup> Do not be amazed at the terms <italic>u-vikashtem</italic> (but&#x2026;ye will seek) and <italic>u-matzata</italic> (and thou shalt find)<sup><xref rid="fn232">61</xref></sup> for Scripture speaks to many, to an entire nation, or to one person.<sup><xref rid="fn233">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. WITH ALL THY HEART. I will explain this later.<sup><xref rid="fn234">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>[31.] HE WILL NOT FAIL THEE. <italic>Yarpekha</italic> (fail thee) is the opposite of strengthen thee.<sup><xref rid="fn235">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. FOR ASK NOW OF THE DAYS PAST. <italic>She&#x2019;al na</italic> means ask now.<sup><xref rid="fn236">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>SINCE THE DAY. The <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>le-min</italic> (since) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn237">66</xref></sup> There are many such examples.<sup><xref rid="fn238">67</xref></sup> On the other hand, it may be there for literary purposes.<sup><xref rid="fn239">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND FROM THE ONE END OF HEAVEN. Heaven, as I have explained, refers to the air,<sup><xref rid="fn240">69</xref></sup> which has ends.<sup><xref rid="fn241">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHETHER THERE HATH BEEN. In his days.</p>
<p>OR HATH BEEN HEARD LIKE IT. The reference being to <italic>Did ever a people hear&#x2026;</italic>(v. 33).</p>
<p>34. OR HATH GOD ASSAYED. Some say that <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) does not refer to the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn242">71</xref></sup> Heaven forbid. It most certainly refers to God.</p>
<p>ASSAYED. Scripture employs human language so that those who hear will understand.</p>
<p>BY TRIALS. This is a general term.<sup><xref rid="fn243">72</xref></sup> Or it refers to trials done via signs.<sup><xref rid="fn244">73</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>and did the signs in the sight of the people</italic> (Ex. 4:30).</p>
<p>AND BY WONDERS. The ten plagues. Scripture states, <italic>and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders</italic> (Ex. 11:10).</p>
<p>AND BY WAR. The reference is most probably to the killing of the first-born and to the punishments meted out to the gods of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn245">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BY A MIGHTY HAND. The reference is to Israel&#x2019;s departure by high hand.<sup><xref rid="fn246">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>The outstretched arm refers to the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud.</p>
<p>AND BY GREAT TERRORS. The drowning of Pharaoh and his army along with the splitting of the sea on behalf of Israel.</p>
<p>IN EGYPT. To the people of Egypt.</p>
<p>35. IT WAS SHOWN. <italic>Horeta</italic> (it was shown) is a <italic>hofal</italic>. The meaning of our clause is, God showed you all this so that you will know that He alone is God.</p>
<p>[THERE IS NONE ELSE.] This is to be understood according to the hint which I gave in my commentary on Koheleth on the verse that reads, <italic>for one higher than the high</italic> (Eccles. 5:7).<sup><xref rid="fn247">76</xref></sup> Hence Scripture reads, <italic>There is none else</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn248">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>[GOD.] I have explained the meaning of <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) in the Torah portion <italic>And Jethro Heard</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn249">78</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>And God</italic> (Elohim) <italic>spoke</italic> (Ex. 20:1); and <italic>God</italic> (Elohim) <italic>answered him by a voice</italic> (Ex. 19:19); <italic>God</italic> (Elohim) <italic>is come</italic> (Ex. 20:17); <italic>where God</italic> (Elohim) <italic>was</italic> (Ex. 20:18); for <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) was the speaker.<sup><xref rid="fn250">79</xref></sup> [I quoted these verses] because there are some who do not understand when one is being brief.<sup><xref rid="fn251">80</xref></sup> It is a deep secret.<sup><xref rid="fn252">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. THAT HE MIGHT INSTRUCT<sup><xref rid="fn253">82</xref></sup> THEE. He made thee to hear Him so that you would fear Him.<sup><xref rid="fn254">83</xref></sup> This is borne out when Israel said, <italic>but let not God speak with us, lest we die</italic> (Ex. 20:16). Look, you feared because of what your eyes saw and your ears heard. There was another reason why God made you hear His voice. He did so because He loved your fathers (v. 37), your fathers being three.<sup><xref rid="fn255">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. AND CHOSE THEIR SEED. <italic>Be-zaro</italic> (their seed)<sup><xref rid="fn256">85</xref></sup> alludes to Jacob. If Scripture had read <italic>be-zaram</italic> (their seed), then the eight nations<sup><xref rid="fn257">86</xref></sup> would have been included with us.</p>
<p>AND BROUGHT THEE OUT WITH HIS PRESENCE. <italic>Befanav</italic> (with His presence)<sup><xref rid="fn258">87</xref></sup> means with His anger.<sup><xref rid="fn259">88</xref></sup> He was angry at Egypt.</p>
<p>Others say that <italic>panav</italic> (presence) here is similar to <italic>panav</italic> (presence) in <italic>And the angel of His presence saved them</italic> (Is. 63:9).<sup><xref rid="fn260">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, I believe that <italic>panav</italic> (presence) here is similar to <italic>panekha</italic> (thine own person) in <italic>and thou go to battle in thy own person</italic> (Josh. 17:11).<sup><xref rid="fn261">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. AS IT IS THIS DAY. Close to this day.<sup><xref rid="fn262">91</xref></sup> However, it really alludes to their possession of the land of the two Amorite kings, for Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh are called Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn263">92</xref></sup> Scripture similarly reads, <italic>as Israel did unto the land of his possession</italic> (Deut. 2:12). The reference is not to the future, as many explain.<sup><xref rid="fn264">93</xref></sup> Proof of the latter is the fact that the psalm which opens with the words, <italic>O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good</italic> (Ps. 136) reads, <italic>To Him that smote great kings</italic> (Ps. 136:17). Now the psalm only mentions Sihon<sup><xref rid="fn265">94</xref></sup> and Og<sup><xref rid="fn266">95</xref></sup> (Ps. 136:19,20). The psalm says, <italic>And gave their land for a heritage&#x2026;Even a heritage unto Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn267">96</xref></sup> (Ps. 136:21,22).</p>
<p>After stating that the Lord, <italic>He is God; there is none else beside Him</italic> (v. 35), Moses explains why by giving a very valuable reason. He begins with what the eye sees<sup><xref rid="fn268">97</xref></sup> and goes on to logic and the wisdom of the heart.<sup><xref rid="fn269">98</xref></sup> He says, <italic>Know that the Lord alone is God in the heavens above</italic>, that is, in the heavens which are above human beings<sup><xref rid="fn270">99</xref></sup> and upon the earth which is under people. <italic>And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass</italic> [<italic>and the earth that is under thee shall be iron</italic>] (Deut. 28:23) is proof that this interpretation<sup><xref rid="fn271">100</xref></sup> is correct.</p>
<p>Now that you have seen the terrors, you shall place in your heart the conviction that you are obligated to observe God&#x2019;s commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn272">101</xref></sup> The observance of God&#x2019;s precepts will also go well with you and with your children after you.<sup><xref rid="fn273">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. THEN MOSES SEPARATED. This means, on the day that Moses separated these cities, he spoke the words of the covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn274">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>46. BEYOND THE JORDAN, IN THE VALLEY. The reference is to Mount Abarim before Israel journeyed to the plains of Moab,<sup><xref rid="fn275">104</xref></sup> even though Mount Abarim is in the land of Moab.<sup><xref rid="fn276">105</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn172"><sup>1</sup> Verse 3. For the incident of Baal-peor, see Num. 25:1-9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn173"><sup>2</sup> The <italic>resh</italic>. The root of <italic>vi-yerishtem</italic> is <italic>yod, resh, shin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn174"><sup>3</sup> According to the rules of Hebrew grammar the word should be vocalized <italic>vi-yerashtem</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn175"><sup>4</sup> According to Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, the Chief Bet Din may add laws to the Judaic code. The individual may not. I.E. seems to take the same position.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn177"><sup>6</sup> Moses.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn179"><sup>8</sup> The <italic>bet</italic> here has the meaning of because rather than in. I.E. renders our clause as: your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal-peor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn180"><sup>9</sup> Where the <italic>bet</italic> here has the meaning of because.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn181"><sup>10</sup> Hebrew, <italic>be-chokhmah</italic>. I.E. adds <italic>be-chokhmah</italic> to indicate that God responds only to intelligent requests. The word <italic>be-chokhmah</italic> is not found in <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn182"><sup>11</sup> I.E. explains earth (<italic>adamah</italic>) as referring to the Land of Israel, as in Deut. 11:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn183"><sup>12</sup> The heart lies in the middle of the body. Hence heart is used in the sense of middle. See I.E. on Ex. 15:8 (Vol. 2, p. 299). When a person looks straight up, it appears to him that he is staring at the middle of the sky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn184"><sup>13</sup> It means the middle of the sea. See above note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn185"><sup>14</sup> <italic>Only a voice</italic> is short for you only heard a voice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn186"><sup>15</sup> Hence this interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn187"><sup>16</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn188"><sup>17</sup> Scripture interchanges the way the senses are referred to because they are all perceived in one central place. See I.E. on Gen. 42:1 (Vol. 1, p. 386). Hence Scripture uses the term saw for heard.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn189"><sup>18</sup> That is, from the time of the revelation at Sinai until they sent out the spies to Canaan in the second year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn190"><sup>19</sup> Deut. 1:5.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn199"><sup>28</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ve-nidachta</italic> (literally, and you will slip). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn200"><sup>29</sup> Literally, advisor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn201"><sup>30</sup> How Israel was the cause of Moses&#x2019; not entering the Land of Israel. See I.E. on Num. 20:8 (Vol. 4, p. 159).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn202"><sup>31</sup> Verses 14 and 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn203"><sup>32</sup> Moses repeats himself because he wants to add: Since the Lord Your God is a devouring fire, take heed to yourself and do not worship idols.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn204"><sup>33</sup> Literally, the likeness of all.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn205"><sup>34</sup> In other words, <italic>kol</italic> is short for <italic>kol davar</italic> (all things, i.e., any thing).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn206"><sup>35</sup> <italic>Asher tzivvekha</italic> (hath forbidden thee) literally reads, which He has commanded you. However, it cannot have this meaning here for then our verse would read: and make you a graven image, even the likeness of anything which the Lord your God has commanded you. Hence I.E. comments that <italic>asher tzivvekha</italic> is to be read, <italic>ka&#x2019;asher tzivvekha</italic>. In other words, it is to be interpreted as, which the Lord your God had commanded.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn207"><sup>36</sup> In other words, <italic>commanded</italic> has the meaning of prohibited.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn208"><sup>37</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn209"><sup>38</sup> Here too the word command has the meaning of prohibit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn210"><sup>39</sup> That is, <italic>temunat kol</italic> (likeness of anything) refers to the making of an image of the stars.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn211"><sup>40</sup> For Deut. 5:8 speaks of <italic>kol temunah asher ba-shamayim mi-ma&#x2019;al</italic> (even any manner of likeness, of anything that is in heaven above).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn212"><sup>41</sup> In other words, <italic>esh okhlah hu</italic> (a devouring fire) should be interpreted as if written, <italic>ke-esh okhlah hu</italic> (like a devouring fire). I.E. notes this lest anyone take our text to imply any corporeality in God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn213"><sup>42</sup> In other words, <italic>I call heaven and earth to witness against you</italic> means I call the angels in heaven and the inhabitants of earth to witness against you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn214"><sup>43</sup> As a result of lack of rain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn215"><sup>44</sup> <italic>As the days of the heavens above the earth</italic> means eternally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn216"><sup>45</sup> To heaven and earth bearing witness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn217"><sup>46</sup> Which implies that the heavens are not eternal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn218"><sup>47</sup> Other similar verses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn219"><sup>48</sup> He does not understand the true meaning of the verse, for it is not to be taken literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn220"><sup>49</sup> The usual form of the word is <italic>tovedu</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn221"><sup>50</sup> The correct reading is <italic>yilmedun</italic> (v. 10). <italic>Tilmedun</italic> is not found in Scripture. See Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn222"><sup>51</sup> The usual form of the word is <italic>yilmedu</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn223"><sup>52</sup> <italic>Tovedun</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn224"><sup>53</sup> With a <italic>tzere</italic> rather than a <italic>sheva</italic> beneath the <italic>bet</italic> as in <italic>yilmedun</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn225"><sup>54</sup> If the word was closely connected to that which follows then it would have been vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>. Compare <italic>te&#x2019;abbedun</italic> (ye shall surely destroy) (Deut. 12:2) (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn226"><sup>55</sup> <italic>Mete</italic> (few) means men of. Anything that can be numbered is deemed a few. See I.E. on Gen. 34:30 (Vol. 1, p. 330).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn227"><sup>56</sup> Seeing, hearing, tasting, and smelling.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn228"><sup>57</sup> The sense of touch.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn229"><sup>58</sup> Coarser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn230"><sup>59</sup> The other senses are of a higher order. In other words, Scripture speaks only of the specialized senses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn231"><sup>60</sup> It is spread all over the body. All parts of the body are sensitive to touch.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn232"><sup>61</sup> <italic>U-vikashtem</italic> (but&#x2026;ye will seek) is plural. <italic>U-matzata</italic> (and thou shalt find) is singular. We would expect Scripture to be consistent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn233"><sup>62</sup> Hence it employs both the singular and the plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn234"><sup>63</sup> The observance of the commandments is contingent on the perfection of the heart. See I.E. on Deut. 30:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn235"><sup>64</sup> Thus <italic>yarpekha</italic> (fail thee) means will cause you to weaken.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn236"><sup>65</sup> In other words, <italic>na</italic> means now. See I.E. on Gen. 12:11 (Vol 1, p. 154).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn237"><sup>66</sup> <italic>Le-min</italic> literally means to-from. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that <italic>le-min</italic> is to be interpreted as if written from (or since).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn238"><sup>67</sup> Of Scripture&#x2019;s use of superfluous letters. See Vol. 1, p. XVII.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn239"><sup>68</sup> Perhaps to rhyme with <italic>le-yamim, le-miktzeh</italic>, and other <italic>lameds</italic> in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn240"><sup>69</sup> The firmament.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn241"><sup>70</sup> At the point where the firmament appears to merge with the sea. See I.E. on Gen. 1:6 and the notes thereto (Vol. 1, p. 34). From this it appears that the correct reading in I.E. on Gen. 1:6, is, as was stated, <italic>ketzot ha-shamayim</italic> rather than <italic>ketzot ha-shemesh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn242"><sup>71</sup> It refers to any god.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn243"><sup>72</sup> It refers to all sorts of trials.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn244"><sup>73</sup> In other words, it refers to signs which were brought by God in bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn245"><sup>74</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 12:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn246"><sup>75</sup> Confidently and fearlessly. See Ex. 14:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn247"><sup>76</sup> I.E. there explains that the verse alludes to a hierarchy of 55 powers in heaven.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn248"><sup>77</sup> That is, God is the ultimate power.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn249"><sup>78</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 18:19 (Vol. 2, p. 361).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn250"><sup>79</sup> Hence Scripture describes God as speaking.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn251"><sup>80</sup> Hence one quote would be insufficient.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn252"><sup>81</sup> Why Scripture refers to God by the term <italic>Elohim</italic>. I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 26) explains that <italic>Elohim</italic> means angels and that God is referred to as <italic>Elohim</italic> because God works through the angels. I.E. seems to imply that God revealed himself on Sinai through angels rather than through His own essence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn253"><sup>82</sup> Hebrew, <italic>le-yassereka</italic> (literally, to discipline you).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn254"><sup>83</sup> I.E. interprets <italic>le-yassereka</italic> as to put God&#x2019;s fear in you. Hence his interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn255"><sup>84</sup> In other words, <italic>thy fathers</italic> (v. 37) refers to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn256"><sup>85</sup> Literally, his seed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn257"><sup>86</sup> The six nations descended from Keturah the concubine of Abraham (Gen. 25:2), the descendants of Ishmael, and the descendants of Esau.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn258"><sup>87</sup> Literally, with His face.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn259"><sup>88</sup> See I.E. on Lev. 26:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn260"><sup>89</sup> I.E. explains this verse as follows: And the angel which He sent with His mouth (the mouth is in the face) saved them; that is, God commanded an angel to save them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn261"><sup>90</sup> In other words, <italic>panav</italic> is to be rendered presence. See I.E. on Ex. 33:14 (Vol. 2, p. 688).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn262"><sup>91</sup> In the near future. I.E. comments thus because Israel had not as yet possessed the Land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn263"><sup>92</sup> They are part of the people of Israel. Hence if they possessed their land, Moses could speak to all of Israel that they already possessed the land of mighty nations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn264"><sup>93</sup> But rather to the land possessed by Reuben, Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn265"><sup>94</sup> King of the Amorites who dwelled in Transjordan</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn269"><sup>98</sup> <italic>That thou mightest know</italic>. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know</italic> means what you saw with your eyes convinced your mind that the Lord alone is God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn270"><sup>99</sup> The layer of air. I.E. distinguished between the Heaven of Heavens (the place of the stars and planets) and the firmament. See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 21).</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 5</title>
<p>1. AND MOSES CALLED UNTO ALL ISRAEL. As I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn277">1</xref></sup> to make the children hear the words of the covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn278">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. IN HOREB. This is Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn279">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. THE LORD MADE NOT THIS COVENANT WITH OUR FATHERS. Alone.<sup><xref rid="fn280">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT WITH US, EVEN US. The meaning of <italic>ittanu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn281">5</xref></sup> (even us) is, but also with us.<sup><xref rid="fn282">6</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>thy name shall not be called any more Jacob</italic> (Gen. 35:10).<sup><xref rid="fn283">7</xref></sup> Or it means the Lord did not make a covenant with our fathers who were in Egypt but only with us,<sup><xref rid="fn284">8</xref></sup> for there were many in the camp who heard the covenant from the mouth of God.<sup><xref rid="fn285">9</xref></sup> Moses therefore said even us, those who are here, and are alive. Moses&#x2019; words, <italic>with you</italic> (v. 4) and [<italic>I stood</italic>] <italic>between</italic> [<italic>the Lord</italic>] <italic>and you</italic> (v. 5) is proof of the correctness of this interpretation.</p>
<p>4. FACE TO FACE. Without an intermediary.<sup><xref rid="fn286">10</xref></sup> This means I spoke to you, although you did not see Me. The metaphor used in our verse is that of a person who speaks to another person face to face even though the person being spoken to does not see that speaker.<sup><xref rid="fn287">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. I STOOD BETWEEN THE LORD AND YOU. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn288">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR YE WERE AFRAID BECAUSE OF THE FIRE. Even though you did not go up the mountain.</p>
<p>[SAYING.] The word <italic>saying</italic> is connected to the previous verse. Its meaning is, <italic>The Lord spoke with you face to face&#x2026;out of the midst of the fire</italic> (v. 4) <italic>saying</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn289">13</xref></sup> It is possible that <italic>I stood between the Lord and you</italic> means I stood between the Lord and you after the revelation at Sinai. Its meaning is, God spoke with you face to face [at Sinai] and from that day on I stood between the Lord and you because you were afraid,<sup><xref rid="fn290">14</xref></sup> as Moses goes on to explain.</p>
<p>AND WENT NOT UP INTO THE MOUNT. When I went up. Compare, <italic>but Moses drew near unto the thick darkness</italic> (Ex. 20:18).</p>
<p>Do not pay attention to the fact that the word <italic>saying</italic> is far removed [from the end of verse 4],<sup><xref rid="fn291">15</xref></sup> for there are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn292">16</xref></sup> The speaker<sup><xref rid="fn293">17</xref></sup> did not separate the verses and sections.<sup><xref rid="fn294">18</xref></sup> Also do not pay attention to the words,<sup><xref rid="fn295">19</xref></sup> for they are like bodies and their meanings are like souls.<sup><xref rid="fn296">20</xref></sup> One who cuts with two similar tools produces the same result. Scripture therefore interchanges <italic>shav</italic> (false)<sup><xref rid="fn297">21</xref></sup> (v. 17) and <italic>sheker</italic> (false) (Ex. 20:13),<sup><xref rid="fn298">22</xref></sup> as these terms are brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn299">23</xref></sup> All lies are vanity. I have already explained that the word <italic>zakhor</italic> (remember) (v. 8) means the same as <italic>shamor</italic> (keep).<sup><xref rid="fn300">24</xref></sup> Moses adds,<sup><xref rid="fn301">25</xref></sup> <italic>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic> (v. 12). It means, when you stood around Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn302">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. NOR THINE OX, NOR THINE ASS, NOR ANY OF THY CATTLE. A particular followed by a general term.<sup><xref rid="fn303">27</xref></sup> At first<sup><xref rid="fn304">28</xref></sup> only the general term is used. Both say the same.<sup><xref rid="fn305">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT&#x2026;MAY REST. Scripture here adds the explanation of the law regarding the man-servant and the maid-servant,<sup><xref rid="fn306">30</xref></sup> namely, <italic>And thou shalt remember that thou was a servant</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn307">31</xref></sup> Now God gave rest to your servant. <italic>Therefore the Lord your God commanded</italic> [thee] to do this on the Sabbath day refers to giving rest to one&#x2019;s servant.<sup><xref rid="fn308">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say<sup><xref rid="fn309">33</xref></sup> that a servant does not rest.<sup><xref rid="fn310">34</xref></sup> Now God took you out of slavery and commanded you to rest so that you will remember that you were a slave.<sup><xref rid="fn311">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the commandment that begins with the word <italic>Honor</italic> (v. 16),<sup><xref rid="fn312">36</xref></sup> Scripture goes on to say, <italic>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic>. This is to be understood in line with my interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn313">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THAT IT MAY GO WELL WITH THEE. Some say that this alludes to the world to come. I will allude to the secret of the world to come in my comments on <italic>I kill, and I make alive</italic> (Deut. 32:39).</p>
<p>THY DAYS. Scripture goes on to explain that they will be good days.<sup><xref rid="fn314">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Know that all the early sages are of the opinion that <italic>I am</italic> (v. 6) is the first statement<sup><xref rid="fn315">39</xref></sup> even though there is room to ask why the one who separated the statements did not separate <italic>Thou shalt have no other gods</italic> (v. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn316">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>I have already explained the Ten Statements,<sup><xref rid="fn317">41</xref></sup> relying on their opinion.<sup><xref rid="fn318">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, I believe that the statement <italic>I am</italic> is not part of the Ten Statements, for the meaning of <italic>I am</italic> is, I am the one who commands. <italic>I am</italic> is the basis of the commandments, as I have explained previously.<sup><xref rid="fn319">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>chamad</italic> (coveted) has two meanings in Hebrew.<sup><xref rid="fn320">44</xref></sup> One is to rob, to extort, to take someone&#x2019;s property by force and compulsion. This is the meaning of the word in <italic>neither shall any man covet</italic> (yachmod) <italic>thy land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn321">45</xref></sup> (Ex. 34:24). For if this is not its meaning, then the land is bad. But Scripture only comes to praise the land. The second meeting is to desire in the heart without acting.<sup><xref rid="fn322">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, <italic>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> (Ex. 20:14) is the ninth statement, and <italic>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>) is the tenth statement.<sup><xref rid="fn323">47</xref></sup> According to this interpretation, <italic>thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> and <italic>thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife</italic> are connected to each other.<sup><xref rid="fn324">48</xref></sup> On the other hand, <italic>thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> might be a general rule.<sup><xref rid="fn325">49</xref></sup> The fact that Moses in this book [Deuteronomy] in which he explains the Torah, employs <italic>ve-lo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn326">50</xref></sup> <italic>titavveh</italic> (neither shalt thou covet) (v. 18) in place of <italic>lo tachmod</italic> (thou shalt not covet) (Ex. 20:14) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn327">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many say that one cannot sin with one&#x2019;s thoughts and there is no reward and punishment for what one thinks. However, one can refute them by quoting many verses. I will not prolong my argument. I will merely point to the following: <italic>A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts</italic> (Prov. 6:18); <italic>thou didst well that it was in thy heart</italic> (II Chron. 6:8); <italic>And to them that are upright in their hearts</italic> (Ps. 125:4). Moses at the end<sup><xref rid="fn328">52</xref></sup> said, <italic>in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it</italic> (Deut. 30:14). The main purpose of the <italic>mitzvot</italic> is to perfect the heart. Most of them serve as a memorial.<sup><xref rid="fn329">53</xref></sup> The distinction made between a sin committed deliberately and one committed inadvertently should convince them.<sup><xref rid="fn330">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THESE WORDS. Its meaning is, these Ten Statements and not the words which follow them.<sup><xref rid="fn331">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>A GREAT VOICE. They never heard one like it.</p>
<p>AND IT WENT ON NO MORE. This occurred only one time. Observe, Scripture explains why the voice <italic>went on no more</italic>, namely, <italic>And it came to pass, when ye heard&#x2026;</italic>(v. 20).</p>
<p>21. HIS GLORY. The appearance of fire.</p>
<p>AND HIS GREATNESS. The voices, the lightning, and the sound of the <italic>shofar</italic>.</p>
<p>AND&#x2026;HIS VOICE. The Ten Statements. There is one opinion that God only uttered <italic>I am</italic> (v. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn332">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. THE VOICE OF THE LIVING GOD. <italic>Elohim</italic> (God), as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn333">57</xref></sup> is in the plural.</p>
<p>I believe that Scripture uses the term <italic>living</italic> to differentiate between God<sup><xref rid="fn334">58</xref></sup> and the heavenly host,<sup><xref rid="fn335">59</xref></sup> for the heavenly host does not move by its own power.<sup><xref rid="fn336">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND THOU SHALT SPEAK UNTO US ALL. The word <italic>at</italic> (thou)<sup><xref rid="fn337">61</xref></sup> is similar to the word <italic>at</italic> (thou) in <italic>And if Thou</italic><sup><xref rid="fn338">62</xref></sup> (at) <italic>deal thus with me</italic> (Num. 11:15). It is explained there.<sup><xref rid="fn339">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. THEY HAVE WELL SAID. <italic>Hetivu</italic> (they have well) is a verb in the perfect. It comes from a root in which only two letters are sounded.<sup><xref rid="fn340">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. OH THAT. Scripture does not say <italic>mi yitten li</italic> (oh that I) but rather <italic>mi yitten la-hem</italic> (oh that they).<sup><xref rid="fn341">65</xref></sup> The word <italic>la-hem</italic> (they) thus follows <italic>ve-hayah levavam zeh</italic> (such a heart as this).<sup><xref rid="fn342">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note, God&#x2019;s decrees are the source of all actions and movements.<sup><xref rid="fn343">67</xref></sup> The power and nature of all that is found beneath the heavens is determined by the arrangement of the heavenly bodies. These are connected to the roots below.<sup><xref rid="fn344">68</xref></sup> The same applies to the compounds.<sup><xref rid="fn345">69</xref></sup> All things similarly depend on the movements of the heavenly bodies day by day and time by time, for there is always a change,<sup><xref rid="fn346">70</xref></sup> as the author of the <italic>Sefer Yetizrah</italic> explained.<sup><xref rid="fn347">71</xref></sup> The parts<sup><xref rid="fn348">72</xref></sup> receive<sup><xref rid="fn349">73</xref></sup> from the categories<sup><xref rid="fn350">74</xref></sup> according to their nature.<sup><xref rid="fn351">75</xref></sup> It is due to the power of the &#x201C;categories&#x201D; that they<sup><xref rid="fn352">76</xref></sup> can make some small changes in nature.<sup><xref rid="fn353">77</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>and the Lord hardened Pharaoh&#x2019;s heart</italic> (Ex. 11:10).<sup><xref rid="fn354">78</xref></sup> In another place, Scripture states, <italic>and hardened his heart, he and his servants</italic> (Ex. 9:34).<sup><xref rid="fn355">79</xref></sup> It is all true. Scripture therefore states, <italic>O Lord, I know that man&#x2019;s way is not his own</italic> (Jer. 10:23). It similarly states, <italic>O Lord, why dost Thou make us to err from Thy ways</italic> (Jer. 63:17). Moses said, <italic>therefore choose life</italic> (Deut. 30:19).<sup><xref rid="fn356">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, since God does not withhold good,<sup><xref rid="fn357">81</xref></sup> He loves to do good. Scripture employs human language when it says, <italic>Oh that</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn358">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. GO SAY TO THEM. Moses was to go down.<sup><xref rid="fn359">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. STAND THOU HERE BY ME. Moses was to return.<sup><xref rid="fn360">84</xref></sup> Scripture similarly states, <italic>and I will speak unto thee all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances</italic>. It is thus clear that most of the Torah was told to Moses at Sinai. However, Moses transmitted it in the wilderness of Sinai. I believe that he did so in the eleven days that they traveled from Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn361">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. YE SHALL OBSERVE TO DO. Scripture states this<sup><xref rid="fn362">86</xref></sup> in order to add, <italic>and ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left</italic>.</p>
<p>30. IN ALL THE WAY. This explains <italic>to the right hand or to the left</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn363">87</xref></sup> The main purpose of this commandment<sup><xref rid="fn364">88</xref></sup> and the statutes and ordinances is that you, your son, and your son&#x2019;s son fear the Lord. Faith of the heart is the basis of the commandments. When you fear God, you are fulfilling your destiny as a person. Man, as is noted by Koheleth, was created for this very reason.<sup><xref rid="fn365">89</xref></sup> Furthermore, your days will be prolonged with everyone<sup><xref rid="fn366">90</xref></sup> on the land and for the individual,<sup><xref rid="fn367">91</xref></sup> in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn368">92</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn296"><sup>20</sup> In other words, it is the ideas and not the exact wording that matters. See I.E. on Ex. 20:1 (Vol. 2, pp. 394-406).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn299"><sup>23</sup> They convey the same meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn300"><sup>24</sup> Ex. 20:8 reads: <italic>Remember</italic> (zakhor) <italic>the sabbath day to keep it holy</italic>. Deut. 5:12 reads: <italic>Remember</italic> (shamor) <italic>the sabbath day to keep it holy</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn301"><sup>25</sup> When repeating the commandment in Deuteronomy to observe the Sabbath. <italic>As the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic> is not found in Exodus. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn302"><sup>26</sup> The meaning of <italic>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic> is keep the Sabbath as God commanded you at Sinai when he revealed the Decalogue.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn303"><sup>27</sup> Ox and ass are particulars. Cattle is the general term.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn304"><sup>28</sup> In the first version of the Decalogue. The parallel verse in Ex. 20:10 reads: <italic>nor thy cattle</italic>. Ox and ass are not mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn305"><sup>29</sup> Both versions state the same idea.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn306"><sup>30</sup> Why they are to rest on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn307"><sup>31</sup> This explanation is not found in the parallel verse in Exodus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn308"><sup>32</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of <italic>therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn309"><sup>33</sup> Some offer another meaning for <italic>And thou shalt remember that thou was a servant</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn310"><sup>34</sup> The Jews in Egypt did not have any rest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn311"><sup>35</sup> According to this interpretation, it is not a reason for giving the servant rest but it is a reason why the Israelite himself must rest. He must do so because his rest will remind him that he was a slave and that God freed him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn312"><sup>36</sup> <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn313"><sup>37</sup> On verse 5. There I.E. comments that <italic>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic> (v. 12) means as the Lord thy God commanded thee when you stood around Mount Sinai. Similarly, here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn314"><sup>38</sup> <italic>And that it may be well with thee</italic> elaborates on <italic>that thy days may be long</italic>; i.e., your long days will be good days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn315"><sup>39</sup> Contra I.E. who believes that the Decalogue begins with v. 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn316"><sup>40</sup> From <italic>I am</italic>. The Decalogue is divided into ten sections in the massoretic edition of the Torah. Each of these sections is devoted to a particular statement. Now, if <italic>I am</italic> is an independent statement, it should form an independent section. However, it does not. Hence <italic>I am</italic> seems to be an introduction to that which follows. We have followed <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 which reads <italic>lo hifsik</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn317"><sup>41</sup> And noted that <italic>I am</italic> is the first of the Ten Statements. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Ex. 20:1 in both the long and the short commentary. See Vol. 2, pp. 401-404.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn318"><sup>42</sup> On the opinion of the early sages.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn319"><sup>43</sup> &#x201C;<italic>I am</italic> includes all precepts directed at the heart, tongue, and human deeds. For one who does not believe in his heart that God exists has no reason to be obligated to observe any commandments&#x201D; (I.E., Vol. 2, p. 415).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn320"><sup>44</sup> I.E. is commenting on verse 18, which reads: <italic>ve-lo tachmod</italic> (neither shalt thou covet).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn321"><sup>45</sup> If <italic>neither shall any man covet</italic> (yachmod) <italic>thy land</italic> means no one shall desire your land, then the Land of Israel would be an undesirable land. Hence the meaning of <italic>neither shall any man covet</italic> (yachmod) <italic>thy land</italic> must be no one will take your land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn322"><sup>46</sup> On the desire.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn323"><sup>47</sup> This interpretation does not count <italic>I am</italic> as the first statement of the Decalogue. Therefore, it counts <italic>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> and <italic>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife</italic> as two separate statements.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn324"><sup>48</sup> That is, they have a similar meaning even though they form two separate statements. Hence Scripture can invert these statements. I.E. comments thus because in Exodus the prohibition against coveting <italic>thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> precedes <italic>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife</italic>, while the reverse is true in Deuteronomy (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn325"><sup>49</sup> In other words, <italic>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> is the tenth statement. Scripture first states the general rule and then goes into detail; that is, <italic>Neither&#x2026;thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> includes your neighbor&#x2019;s wife, servant, ox, ass, and all that he owns. According to this interpretation, <italic>I am</italic> is the first statement and <italic>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> is the tenth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn326"><sup>50</sup> I.E, <italic>lo</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn327"><sup>51</sup> That <italic>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> is a general statement, for Moses explains it by using a different term in Deuteronomy.</ftnote>

<p>3. AND OBSERVE TO DO IT. Behold. I command you to observe that it may be well with you.</p>
<p>A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. This is connected to <italic>to possess it</italic> (v. I).<sup><xref rid="fn369">1</xref></sup> Now, it is far from it,<sup><xref rid="fn370">2</xref></sup> or it is missing a <italic>bet</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn371">3</xref></sup> as in <italic>that was found in the house of the Lord</italic> (II Kings 12:11).<sup><xref rid="fn372">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>[4. HEAR O ISRAEL: THE LORD (<italic>YHVH</italic>) OUR GOD, THE LORD (<italic>YHVH</italic>) IS ONE.] That which the ancients, of blessed memory, transmitted regarding the reading of the <italic>shema</italic> is true,<sup><xref rid="fn373">5</xref></sup> and there is no need for further investigation.</p>
<p>Note that the glorious name (<italic>YHVH</italic>) is a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn374">6</xref></sup> This being the case, why is it said a second time?<sup><xref rid="fn375">7</xref></sup> The answer is that Adam is a noun. Adam is also an adjective, and not a noun,<sup><xref rid="fn376">8</xref></sup> even though<sup><xref rid="fn377">9</xref></sup> he was called after the very earth. The same is true of the name <italic>YHVH</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn378">10</xref></sup> The fact that <italic>YHVH</italic> is connected to <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> (hosts)<sup><xref rid="fn379">11</xref></sup> is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn380">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, the term <italic>Elohenu</italic> (our God) might be the object.<sup><xref rid="fn381">13</xref></sup> The name <italic>YHVH</italic> was repeated in order to state <italic>YHVH echad</italic> (the Lord is one) the meaning of which is, only <italic>YHVH</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn382">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are many proofs that <italic>YHVH</italic> alone is God.<sup><xref rid="fn383">15</xref></sup> The verse that states, <italic>In that day shall the Lord be One</italic> (echad)<sup><xref rid="fn384">16</xref></sup> (Zech. 14:9), speaks of men&#x2019;s thoughts.<sup><xref rid="fn385">17</xref></sup> In my opinion, the word one<sup><xref rid="fn386">18</xref></sup> is connected to the word king, for Scripture writes: <italic>And the Lord shall be King over all the earth; In that day shall the Lord</italic> alone be King <italic>and His name one</italic> (Zech. 14:9).<sup><xref rid="fn387">19</xref></sup> The latter is similar in meaning to <italic>For then will I turn to the peoples, A pure language, That they may all call upon the name of the Lord</italic> (Zeph. 3:9&#x007D;. Behold, all the nations will speak one language. The name of the Lord will therefore be one.</p>
<p>5. AND THOU SHALT LOVE. Since we have no other god aside from the Lord, you are obligated to love Him, for we have no other god.<sup><xref rid="fn388">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH ALL THY HEART, AND WITH ALL THY SOUL. The heart refers to knowledge. It is another term for the spirit of intelligence,<sup><xref rid="fn389">21</xref></sup> for the heart is its first residence.<sup><xref rid="fn390">22</xref></sup> The same applies to <italic>wise-hearted</italic> (Ex. 36:1) and to <italic>He that getteth a heart</italic> (Prov. 19:8).<sup><xref rid="fn391">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>THY SOUL.<sup><xref rid="fn392">24</xref></sup> The reference is to the spirit, which is in the body.<sup><xref rid="fn393">25</xref></sup> It is the spirit which lusts.<sup><xref rid="fn394">26</xref></sup> Its power is manifest in the liver.</p>
<p>THY MIGHT. The meaning of <italic>me&#x2019;odekha</italic> (thy might) is very very much.<sup><xref rid="fn395">27</xref></sup> It means that you should love Him to the utmost in any way that you are able. Your heart should be totally committed to the love of God.</p>
<p>[6.] AND THESE WORDS&#x2026;SHALL BE. Those who deny the Rabbinic tradition<sup><xref rid="fn396">28</xref></sup> say that the reference is to the Decalogue, and that it is in reference to the Decalogue that Scripture states, <italic>And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts</italic> (v. 9). However, the truth is that <italic>and these words&#x2026;shall be</italic> refers to all of the commandments.</p>
<p>7. AND THOU SHALT TEACH THEM. <italic>Ve-shinantam</italic> (and thou shalt teach them) is related to the word <italic>shanun</italic> (sharp) in <italic>and a sharp arrow</italic> (Prov. 25:18). The method of sharpening an arrow is well known.<sup><xref rid="fn397">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observe. Our verse teaches that the main purpose of man is to serve God.<sup><xref rid="fn398">30</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s service consists in recognizing God&#x2019;s works.<sup><xref rid="fn399">31</xref></sup> However, the transmitters of tradition taught that [our verse] refers to the time of reading the <italic>shema</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn400">32</xref></sup> We all rely on them.</p>

<p>AND WHEN THOU LIEST DOWN. To sleep, for one is not obligated to observe the commandments when one sleeps.<sup><xref rid="fn402">34</xref></sup> Behold, the meaning of our verse is, <italic>And thou shalt talk of them</italic> verbally and in your heart.</p>
<p>8. AND THOU SHALT BIND THEM FOR A SIGN UPON THY HAND. This has been explained.<sup><xref rid="fn403">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY SHALL BE FOR FRONTLETS. The word <italic>totafot</italic> (frontlets) is not found elsewhere in Scripture. Those who dispute the Rabbinic tradition<sup><xref rid="fn404">36</xref></sup> say that <italic>totafot</italic> is related to the word <italic>ve-hatef</italic> (and preach) in <italic>and preach toward the South</italic> (Ezek. 21:2). This is impossible, for the root of <italic>hattef</italic> is <italic>nun, tet, peh</italic>. However, there are two <italic>tets</italic> ands no <italic>nun</italic> in <italic>totafot</italic>.</p>
<p>[9.] AND THOU SHALT WRITE THEM. They<sup><xref rid="fn405">37</xref></sup> also said that its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn406">38</xref></sup> is <italic>Bind them</italic> (Prov. 6:8).<sup><xref rid="fn407">39</xref></sup> Now since our fathers received the truth, we will forsake those who employ their heart to invent things.</p>
<p>11. ALL GOOD THINGS. The word <italic>tuv</italic> (good) is vocalized with a <italic>shuruk</italic> in place of a <italic>cholam</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn408">40</xref></sup> for these vowels interchange and <italic>tuv</italic> is not in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn409">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>[12. OUT OF THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE.] Where you did not possess cities and houses that are full.</p>
<p>13. THOU SHALT FEAR. You shall not violate any of the negative commandments.</p>
<p>SHALT THOU SERVE. By observing the positive commandments.</p>
<p>AND BY HIS NAME SHALT THOU SWEAR. And not by the name of another god when you affirm anything or make a covenant. Similarly, <italic>Every tongue shall swear</italic><sup><xref rid="fn410">42</xref></sup> (Is. 45:23). You shall swear only the truth. The meaning of our verse is, you shall have no other god to swear by his name. You shall only swear by the name of the Lord. Scripture therefore afterwards reads, <italic>Ye shall not go after other gods</italic> (v. 14), and <italic>ye shall not try the Lord your God</italic> (v. 16).</p>
<p>16. IN MASSAH. Massah is the name of a place mentioned earlier, <italic>And the name of the place was called Massah</italic> (Ex. 17:7). The <italic>bet</italic> which is prefixed to Massah is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn411">43</xref></sup> like the <italic>bet</italic> prefixed to <italic>karkor</italic> in <italic>Now Zebah and Zalmona were in Karkor</italic><sup><xref rid="fn412">44</xref></sup> (Jud. 8:10), and the <italic>bet</italic> placed before Telaim in <italic>And numbered them in Telaim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn413">45</xref></sup> (I Sam. 15:4). I explained it<sup><xref rid="fn414">46</xref></sup> there.</p>
<p>Massah was so called because Israel said, <italic>Is the Lord among us</italic> (Ex. 17:7).<sup><xref rid="fn415">47</xref></sup> If He is, then we will serve Him.</p>
<p>[Moses told Israel:] you have no need to test God. All you have to do is observe His commandments. If you do what is good in His sight, the Lord will do to you all that is good for you and will thrust out all of your enemies.</p>
<p>19. TO THRUST OUT. The <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>la-hadof</italic> (to thrust out) is a root letter, as the word <italic>hadofo</italic> (cast it upon him) (Num. 35:22) proves.</p>
<p>20. WHAT MEAN THE TESTIMONIES. It means, Why, out of all people, is this burden placed upon us?<sup><xref rid="fn416">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>[21.] THEN THOU SHALT SAY. For God redeemed us from the house of bondage. Now, God did us this good. We are obligated to fear His name<sup><xref rid="fn417">49</xref></sup> because we have recognized that He did good to us in the past. He will do good for us in the future to keep us alive, for His commandments <italic>are life unto those that find them</italic> (Prov. 4:22).</p>
<p>25. AND IT SHALL BE RIGHTEOUSNESS UNTO US. Some say that this verse hints at the reward in the world to come for the observance of the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn418">50</xref></sup> However, according to the plain meaning of the text, our verse teaches that following God&#x2019;s will is the righteous thing to do, for He is our Master. I believe that the correct meaning is, all the nations shall see that we are righteous when we keep God&#x2019;s commandments and statutes, which Scripture clearly states are righteous.<sup><xref rid="fn419">51</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn369"><sup>1</sup> <italic>A land flowing with milk and honey</italic> is connected to the end of the first verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn370"><sup>2</sup> <italic>A land flowing with milk and honey</italic> concludes the first verse even though it is some distance from it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn371"><sup>3</sup> In other words, <italic>eretz</italic> (a land) is to be read as if written <italic>be-eretz</italic> (in a land). In this case, the clause reads, in a land flowing with milk and honey, and is connected to <italic>that it may be well with thee, and that you may increase mightily</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn372"><sup>4</sup> The verse literally reads, that was found house of the Lord. The latter is to be read as if written, that was found in the house of the Lord. In other words, <italic>bet Adonai</italic> is to be read as if written <italic>be-vet Adonai</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn373"><sup>5</sup> According to Rabbinic tradition there is a biblical command to recite <italic>Hear</italic> (shema), <italic>O Israel</italic>, morning and evening.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn374"><sup>6</sup> A proper noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn375"><sup>7</sup> Why repeat the proper noun? Scripture should have read, Hear, O Israel, the Lord (<italic>YHVH</italic>) our God is one. It should be noted that I.E. comments elsewhere that it is biblical style to repeat nouns in the same verse. See I.E. on Gen. 19:24, (Vol. 1, p. 208) and on Ps. 1:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn376"><sup>8</sup> In other words, the name Adam is at times a proper name and at other times an adjective.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn377"><sup>9</sup> &#x201C;Even though&#x201D; seems out of place. Some suggest omitting it. In this case, our text reads: Adam is also an adjective and not a noun, [for] he was called after the very earth. In other words, Adam as an adjective means the one who was created out of the earth. See I.E. on Gen. 2:8 (Vol. 1, p. 53). Adam is derived from the word used for ground (<italic>adamah</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn378"><sup>10</sup> It is employed both as a proper noun and as an adjective. See I.E. on Ex. 3:15 (Vol. 2, pp. 67,68).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn379"><sup>11</sup><italic>Adonai tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> (the Lord of hosts) (Is. 1:9).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn380"><sup>12</sup> For <italic>Adonai</italic> is in the construct with <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic>, whereas a proper name cannot come in the construct. See I.E. on Ex. 3:15 (Vol. 2, p. 65).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn381"><sup>13</sup> In other words, the main purpose of the verse is to teach us that <italic>YHVH</italic> is our God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn382"><sup>14</sup> After Scripture tells us that <italic>YHVH</italic> is our God, it goes on to say that only <italic>YHVH</italic> is our God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn383"><sup>15</sup> The medieval Jewish philosophers proved that there can be only one God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn384"><sup>16</sup> I.E. renders this, In that day shall the Lord alone be God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn385"><sup>17</sup> Actually, the Lord alone is God today also. However, in contemporary times there are many people who worship other gods.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn386"><sup>18</sup> In Zech. 14:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn387"><sup>19</sup> Zech. 14:9 reads: <italic>And the Lord shall be King over all the earth; In that day shall the Lord be One, and His name one</italic>. I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation eliminates the implication that today there are more gods than <italic>YHVH</italic>, for it speaks of all people recognizing one king, i.e., the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn388"><sup>20</sup> I.E. repeats himself for purposes of emphasis. It is also possible that we have a conflation of two different manuscripts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn389"><sup>21</sup> The rational soul.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn390"><sup>22</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 25): &#x201C;Speech is called <italic>safah</italic> (lip) because it is seen to come from the lips.

<ftnote id="fn394"><sup>26</sup> The <italic>nefesh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn395"><sup>27</sup> The word <italic>me&#x2019;od</italic> means much. Thus <italic>me&#x2019;odekha</italic> (your might) literally means your much. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn399"><sup>31</sup><italic>Prima facie</italic>, the reference is to the study of the Torah (see Weiser). However, it should be noted that in I.E., study of God&#x2019;s works usually refers to the study of the sciences. Thus I.E. writes: &#x201C;When one masters astronomy and the circuits of the [sun and. moon], he comes to know the works of God the glorious&#x201D; (<italic>The Secret of the Torah</italic>, p. 21). Perhaps I.E. is alluding here to his belief that the Torah cannot be fully understood unless it is interpreted in light of the studies of science (see <italic>The Secret of the Torah</italic>, pp. 33,34).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn400"><sup>32</sup> According to the sages <italic>when thou liest down</italic> means that we should read the <italic>shema</italic> at night, and <italic>when thou risest up</italic> refers to the reading of the <italic>shema</italic> in the morning. See chapter 1 of <italic>Mishnah Berakhot</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn401"><sup>33</sup> That is, our verse should be read, And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, not And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn402"><sup>34</sup> Thus <italic>and when thou liest down</italic> can&#x2019;t be taken to mean when you sleep.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn403"><sup>35</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 13:9, (Vol. 2, pp. 261,262).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn404"><sup>36</sup> The Karaites. However, in his commentary on Exodus, I.E. does not identify this opinion as being heretical. He merely notes that &#x201C;others say&#x201D; that <italic>totafot</italic> is related to the word <italic>ve-hatef</italic> (and preach). Actually this opinion was quoted by Rashi in the name of Menachem ben Saruk, who, far from being a heretic, was an accepted tenth-century grammarian and Bible commentator. See I.E. on Ex. 13:16 (Vol. 2, p. 266).</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 7</title>
<p>1. AND SHALL CAST OUT. The <italic>nun</italic> in <italic>ve-nashal</italic> (and shall cast out) is a root letter. It is related to the word <italic>yishal</italic> (shall drop off)<sup><xref rid="fn420">1</xref></sup> in for <italic>thine olives shall drop off</italic> (Deut. 28:40).</p>
<p>4. FOR HE WILL TURN AWAY THY SON. The reference<sup><xref rid="fn421">2</xref></sup> is to &#x201C;his son&#x201D; mentioned earlier.<sup><xref rid="fn422">3</xref></sup> That is, do not give your daughter to his son<sup><xref rid="fn423">4</xref></sup> or do not take the daughter<sup><xref rid="fn424">5</xref></sup> mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn425">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. BUT THUS. <italic>Ki im ko ta&#x2019;asu la-ham</italic> means but thus<sup><xref rid="fn426">7</xref></sup> shall ye deal with them<sup><xref rid="fn427">8</xref></sup> because <italic>thou art a holy people</italic> (v. 6) and should not defile yourself with pagan images drawn on pillars, or with <italic>asherim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn428">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. HIS OWN TREASURE. I have already explained the meaning of the word <italic>segullah</italic> (treasure).<sup><xref rid="fn429">10</xref></sup> It means a desirable thing to which nothing comparable is to be found any-where. <italic>Segullat</italic> (treasure)<sup><xref rid="fn430">11</xref></sup> in <italic>and treasure such as kings&#x2026;have as their own</italic> (Eccles. 2:8) is similar.</p>
<p>7. SET HIS LOVE UPON YOU, NOR CHOOSE YOU. You and not anyone else.</p>
<p>8. AND BECAUSE HE WOULD KEEP. <italic>U-mi-shomro</italic> (and because he would keep) is an infinitive.</p>
<p>9. HE IS GOD. This means this is truly the God who has the power and is faithful. <italic>And is faithful</italic> refers to the oath which God took. Scripture says that God is powerful and faithful, because there are others who are faithful but lack the power to keep their oaths and others who are powerful but are unfaithful.</p>
<p>WHO KEEPETH COVENANT AND MERCY WITH THEM THAT LOVE HIM. There are none higher then they.<sup><xref rid="fn431">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS. After them.<sup><xref rid="fn432">13</xref></sup> Or its meaning is, them that love Him in their hearts, they are the ones who keep His commandments verbally and in practice.</p>
<p>TO A THOUSAND GENERATIONS. The one who says that the sphere of the constellations<sup><xref rid="fn433">14</xref></sup> completes its cycle at the end of thirty-six thousand years<sup><xref rid="fn434">15</xref></sup> errs, for we find it moving one degree in seventy years.<sup><xref rid="fn435">16</xref></sup> The meaning of a thousand is, endless.<sup><xref rid="fn436">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND REPAYETH THEM THAT HATE HIM&#x2026;TO DESTROY THEM.<sup><xref rid="fn437">18</xref></sup> To destroy each individual that hates Him.<sup><xref rid="fn438">19</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>But righteous people is secure as a young lion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn439">20</xref></sup> (Prov. 28:1).<sup><xref rid="fn440">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO THEIR FACE. <italic>Be-fanav</italic> (to their face) means to him.<sup><xref rid="fn441">22</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>el panav</italic> (their face) has the meaning of <italic>befanav</italic>, that is, because of His anger.<sup><xref rid="fn442">23</xref></sup> Its means that God will repay the wicked because they hated the truth.<sup><xref rid="fn443">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO DESTROY THEM; HE WILL NOT BE SLACK TO HIM THAT HATETH HIM. Some say that the meaning of our verse is that God rewards the wicked for his good deeds in this world and does not wait to reward him in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn444">25</xref></sup> However, it appears to me that our verse contrasts the righteous<sup><xref rid="fn445">26</xref></sup> who will exist<sup><xref rid="fn446">27</xref></sup> for a thousand generations with the wicked<sup><xref rid="fn447">28</xref></sup> who will be destroyed. Scripture reads, <italic>He will not be slack</italic> because the wicked person thinks that his son or grandson shall live,<sup><xref rid="fn448">29</xref></sup> as in [<italic>visiting the iniquity of the fathers</italic>] <italic>upon the children, and upon the children&#x2019;s children</italic> (Ex. 33:7).<sup><xref rid="fn449">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THOU SHALT THEREFORE KEEP. It means as God keeps the covenant so shall you keep His commandments.</p>
<h1>EKEV</h1>
<p>12. BECAUSE. <italic>Ekev</italic> (because) has the same meaning as <italic>ekev</italic> (reward) in <italic>For ever, reward</italic><sup><xref rid="fn450">31</xref></sup> (Ps. 119:112). It means the reward which will be given at the end.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>who keepeth covenant</italic> in the previous verse (v. 9) is that God kept the covenant with Abraham. If you will be among those that love Him, then He will continue to keep the covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn451">32</xref></sup> If you will be among those who love Him, then <italic>He will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee</italic> (v. 13). This is the meaning of <italic>the covenant and the mercy</italic> (v. 12).</p>
<p>13. THY BODY. Thy children.<sup><xref rid="fn452">33</xref></sup> <italic>Bitnekha</italic> (thy body)<sup><xref rid="fn453">34</xref></sup> is a euphemism.<sup><xref rid="fn454">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE FRUIT OF THY LAND. Scripture mentions com, wine, and oil because they are the most important foods.</p>
<p>THE INCREASE. I have already explained the meaning of <italic>shegar</italic> (the increase of).<sup><xref rid="fn455">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>THY KINE. The word <italic>alafekha</italic> (thy kine) is similar to the word <italic>alufenu</italic> (oxen) in <italic>Whose oxen are well laden</italic> (Ps. 144:14).</p>
<p>AND THE YOUNG OF. <italic>Ashterot</italic> (and the young of) means and the flocks of.</p>
<p>There was a great commentator in Spain<sup><xref rid="fn456">37</xref></sup> who explained why the Hebrews referred to cattle as <italic>alef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn457">38</xref></sup> and to sheep and goats as <italic>ashterot</italic>. He similarly explained the <italic>ba&#x2019;alim</italic> and the <italic>ashtaroth</italic> (Jud. 10:6) as referring to the lord of the flowering constellation<sup><xref rid="fn458">39</xref></sup> and that of the tenth.<sup><xref rid="fn459">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture goes on to say God will not only bless the fruit of your body but there will not be a barren male, that is, one whose seed is infertile, among you or among your cattle. Furthermore, you will be healthy and avoid all sorts of well-known illnesses which normally befall people. You will similarly avoid abnormal, evil diseases.<sup><xref rid="fn460">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THOU SHALT CONSUME. This is a commandment to consume them as one consumes bread, as <italic>thine eye shall not pity them</italic> proves.</p>
<p>FOR THAT WILL BE A SNARE UNTO THEE. The reference is to each one of their gods.<sup><xref rid="fn461">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. THE HORNET. <italic>Ha-tzirah</italic> (the hornet) refers to an illness which afflicts the body. It is related to the word <italic>tzara&#x2019;at</italic> (leprosy).</p>
<p>21. THOU SHALT NOT BE AFFRIGHTED AT THEM. Only fear the Lord, who is great and awful.</p>
<p>[22. LEST THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD INCREASE UPON THEE.] The Gaon says that this is a sign regarding the time that they shall be victorious over them.<sup><xref rid="fn462">43</xref></sup> There is no need for the Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn463">44</xref></sup> I have already explained it.</p>
<p>24. THOU HAST DESTROYED THEM. <italic>Hishmidekha</italic> (thou has destroyed them) is an infinitive even though it is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn464">45</xref></sup> The word <italic>hishir</italic><sup><xref rid="fn465">46</xref></sup> (left him remaining) in <italic>until there was none left him remaining</italic> (Num. 22:35) is most likely similar to it. The word <italic>otam</italic> (them), which is the object,<sup><xref rid="fn466">47</xref></sup> proves that <italic>hishmidekha</italic> is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn467">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>[25. THE SILVER OR THE GOLD THAT IS ON THEM.] <italic>Alehem</italic> is to be rendered, that is on them. Or the meaning of our clause is, you shall not take money to leave them.<sup><xref rid="fn468">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>SNARED. The <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>tivvakesh</italic> (snared) is in place of a <italic>yod</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn469">50</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>yakoshti</italic><sup><xref rid="fn470">51</xref></sup> <italic>lakh</italic> (I have laid a snare for thee).</p>

<ftnote id="fn425"><sup>6</sup> In the previous verse, for she too will turn your son away from Me. For other interpretations, see Krinsky, Meijler, and Filwarg.</ftnote>

<p>1. ALL THE COMMANDMENT. This means, if you want to keep the commandments so that you may live then <italic>remember all the way</italic> (v. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn471">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. THAT HE MIGHT AFFLICT THEE, TO PROVE THEE. I have already explained it.<sup><xref rid="fn472">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND HE AFFLICTED THEE. On the way.</p>
<p>AND SUFFERED THEE TO HUNGER. Before the coming of the manna.<sup><xref rid="fn473">3</xref></sup> Or via the manna itself, for it was light and did not satisfy their heart&#x2019;s desire.<sup><xref rid="fn474">4</xref></sup> However, this is not so.<sup><xref rid="fn475">5</xref></sup> It most probably refers to other desires.<sup><xref rid="fn476">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>KNOW. <italic>Yade&#x2019;un</italic> (know) is spelled with a <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn477">7</xref></sup> So too the word <italic>tzakun</italic> (poured out)<sup><xref rid="fn478">8</xref></sup> in <italic>Silently they poured out a prayer</italic> (Is. 26:16) and <italic>va-yachanun</italic> (and they pitched)<sup><xref rid="fn479">9</xref></sup> in <italic>and they pitched on the other side of the Arnon</italic> (Jud. 11:18).</p>
<p>THAT HE MIGHT MAKE THEE KNOW. <italic>Hodi&#x2019;akha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn480">10</xref></sup>(make thee know) is an infinitive.</p>
<p>BREAD. Which people always eat.</p>
<p>EVERY THING THAT PROCEEDETH OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE LORD. It means that which God has decreed. Compare, <italic>As the word went out of the king&#x2019;s mouth</italic> (Esth. 7:8). The meaning of our verse is, man does not live by bread alone but by the power,<sup><xref rid="fn481">11</xref></sup> or with the power, which comes from on high<sup><xref rid="fn482">12</xref></sup> by the command of God. This is the meaning of <italic>that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord</italic>. The fact that you did not eat bread and you lived is proof of this.</p>
<p>4. THY RAIMENT. Some say via a miracle. Others say that the Israelites brought out many garments from Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn483">13</xref></sup> However, it is most likely the nature of manna not to produce sweat.<sup><xref rid="fn484">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>NEITHER&#x2026;SWELL. The word <italic>batzekah</italic> (swell) is related to the word <italic>batzek</italic> (dough)<sup><xref rid="fn485">15</xref></sup> in <italic>And they baked&#x2026;the dough</italic> (Ex. 12:39). It is usual for the feet of a wayfarer who walks great distances to swell. It is possible that God gave the Israelites strength or that he led them slowly.<sup><xref rid="fn486">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THOU SHALT CONSIDER IN THY HEART.<sup><xref rid="fn487">17</xref></sup> You shall know by believing in your heart.<sup><xref rid="fn488">18</xref></sup> The latter is what counts most.<sup><xref rid="fn489">19</xref></sup> God will reward you by bringing you into the good land, because you obeyed the God who chastens you. You obeyed God even though in order to chasten you, He afflicted you with thirst and made you suffer hunger.</p>
<p>8. A LAND OF WHEAT. Moses makes mention of the foods which produce blood.<sup><xref rid="fn490">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HONEY. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn491">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. SCARCENESS. <italic>Be-miskenut</italic> (scarceness) means in poverty and impoverishment. Compare, <italic>misken</italic> (poor) in <italic>a poor and wise child</italic> (Eccles. 4:13).</p>
<p>13. MULTIPLY. The <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>yirbeyun</italic> (multiply) is in place of a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn492">22</xref></sup> This is not the opinion of Rabbi Mosheh Ha-Kohen the Spaniard.<sup><xref rid="fn493">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. THEN THY HEART BE LIFTED UP. And you will forget that you were a slave and your heart was downcast. You will forget the affliction and the hunger which you experienced in the wilderness and even so the Lord sustained you.<sup><xref rid="fn494">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. WILDERNESS. The word <italic>midbar</italic> (wilderness) is to be read as if written twice, that is, through the great wilderness in length and width and [through] a dreadful wilderness of fiery serpents.<sup><xref rid="fn495">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF FLINT. <italic>Tzur ha-chalamish</italic> (the rock of flint) means the mighty rock.</p>
<p>17. THIS WEALTH. <italic>Chayil</italic> means wealth. Compare, the word <italic>chelam</italic> (their wealth) in <italic>And leave their wealth to others</italic> (Ps. 49:11). <italic>Chelam</italic> refers to that which they acquired by their efforts and strength.<sup><xref rid="fn496">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. BUT THOU SHALT REMEMBER. This means if the thought <italic>My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth</italic> should enter your mind, then remember the One who gives you power.</p>
<p>20. BECAUSE. The word <italic>ekev</italic> (because) refers to payment at the end. It refers both to reward<sup><xref rid="fn497">27</xref></sup> and to punishment.</p>
<ftnote id="fn471"><sup>1</sup> In other words, verse 1 and 2 are not independent statements. Furthermore, <italic>ve-zakharta</italic> (and thou shalt remember) is to be rendered, then thou shalt remember.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn472"><sup>2</sup> How to understand &#x201C;to prove thee.&#x201D; The point is, since God knows the future, what point is there in testing people. I.E. explains divine tests in his comments on the &#x201C;binding of Isaac.&#x201D; He writes, &#x201C;The reason God tested Abraham was to reward him.&#x201D; See I.E. on Gen. 22:1 (Vol. 1, pp. 221-223).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn473"><sup>3</sup> Before the manna descended, Israel suffered hunger. See Ex. 16:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn474"><sup>4</sup> See Num. 21:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn475"><sup>5</sup> For Moses goes on to speak positively of the manna in verse 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn476"><sup>6</sup> Which they could not fulfill in the wilderness (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn477"><sup>7</sup> The usual form of this word is <italic>yade&#x2019;u</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn478"><sup>8</sup> The usual form of the word is <italic>yatzeku</italic>. Be that as it may, the <italic>nun</italic> is not part of the normal form of this word. See I.E. on Is. 26:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn479"><sup>9</sup> The usual form of the word is <italic>va-yachanu</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn480"><sup>10</sup> <italic>Hodi&#x2019;a</italic> plus a pronominal suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn481"><sup>11</sup> In the nature of the food. In other words, God created the world in such a way that man can exist on all types of food. For I.E.&#x2019;s use of the word &#x201C;power&#x201D; in the sense of nature, see I.E. on Deut. 5:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn482"><sup>12</sup> See I.E. on Deut. 5:26: &#x201C;The power and nature of all that is found beneath the heavens is determined by the upper arrangement.&#x201D; According to I.E.&#x2019;s first comment, everything that <italic>proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord</italic> refers to the power to nourish which God placed in all foodstuffs. According to the second interpretation the verse refers to divine providence. The latter was demonstrated by the manna which came from on high.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn483"><sup>13</sup> The meaning of our clause is that they always had garments to wear.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn484"><sup>14</sup> Hence their garments <italic>waxed not old upon</italic> them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn485"><sup>15</sup> Dough swells.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn486"><sup>16</sup> Hence their feet did not swell.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn487"><sup>17</sup> Literally, you shall know in your heart. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn488"><sup>18</sup> What you claim to know should be what your heart believes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn489"><sup>19</sup> True belief. I.E. says, &#x201C;If belief is lacking, then the observance of the commandments is meaningless and serves no purpose&#x201D; (<italic>The Secret of the Torah</italic>, p. 91).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn490"><sup>20</sup> I.E. believed that the seven types of food mentioned in our verse increase the blood supply.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn491"><sup>21</sup> See I.E. on Lev. 2:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn492"><sup>22</sup> For the root of <italic>yirbeyun</italic> is <italic>resh, bet, heh</italic>. Compare the word <italic>yirbeh</italic> (multiplied) later on in the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn493"><sup>23</sup> Who believes that the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>yirbeyun</italic> is a root letter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn494"><sup>24</sup> Even though you were insignificant, God took pity on you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn495"><sup>25</sup> Our verse literally reads: who led thee through the wilderness and the dreadful wherein were serpents, fiery serpents. I.E. believes that our verse should be interpreted as if written, who led thee through the wilderness, a dreadful wilderness, wherein were serpents, fiery serpents, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn496"><sup>26</sup> <italic>Chayil</italic> means strength. Hence I.E. explains that it also refers to that which a person acquires by his efforts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn497"><sup>27</sup> See I.E. on Deut. 7:12.</ftnote>

<p>10. FINGER. This has already been explained.<sup><xref rid="fn504">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AT THE END.<sup><xref rid="fn505">8</xref></sup> At the end or the beginning of the fortieth day.<sup><xref rid="fn506">9</xref></sup> Look. This verse shows that the golden calf was made on the day that the tablets were given to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn507">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND I FELL DOWN. The reference is to Moses&#x2019; statement, <italic>and now I will go up unto the Lord</italic> (Ex. 32:30).<sup><xref rid="fn508">11</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>and now I fell down</italic> is, I fell with my face to the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn509">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THAT TIME ALSO. For he had previously prayed for Israel when they were at the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn510">13</xref></sup> <italic>Wherefore criest thou unto me</italic> (Ex. 14:15) is proof of the latter. Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>and he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord showed him a tree</italic> (Ex. 15:25).</p>
<p>21. AND I TOOK YOUR SIN. The calf is referred to by the term sin. Hence Moses goes on to explain and says, <italic>the calf</italic>.</p>
<p>AND BEAT IT. Into fine dust like the dust of the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn511">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND AT TABERAH. Taberah is probably the name of a place. Israel camped there for but one day. Therefore Scripture does not mention it<sup><xref rid="fn512">15</xref></sup> in the Torah portion <italic>Elleh Mase</italic> (These Are the Stages) (Num. 33:1).<sup><xref rid="fn513">16</xref></sup> It is one of the thirty journeys that Israel traveled from Mount Sinai until they came to Kibroth-hattaavah (Num. 33:17),<sup><xref rid="fn514">17</xref></sup> as I explained.<sup><xref rid="fn515">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reason Scripture connects Taberah with Massah<sup><xref rid="fn516">19</xref></sup> is that the people <italic>were as murmurers</italic> (Num. 11:1);<sup><xref rid="fn517">20</xref></sup> that is, they tested God.<sup><xref rid="fn518">21</xref></sup> Scripture mentions Taberah before Massah<sup><xref rid="fn519">22</xref></sup> because nothing happened to Israel at Massah.<sup><xref rid="fn520">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that Amalek came<sup><xref rid="fn521">24</xref></sup> because Israel tested God.<sup><xref rid="fn522">25</xref></sup> Scripture therefore mentions<sup><xref rid="fn523">26</xref></sup> the burning of God&#x2019;s fire among them,<sup><xref rid="fn524">27</xref></sup> Amalek&#x2019;s smiting of Israel&#x2019;s hindmost,<sup><xref rid="fn525">28</xref></sup> and the smiting of those who lusted.<sup><xref rid="fn526">29</xref></sup> Scripture mentions the most severe punishments first.<sup><xref rid="fn527">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that Taberah and Massah are one and the same place.<sup><xref rid="fn528">31</xref></sup> It is like <italic>From the top of Senir and Hermon</italic> (Cant. 4:8).<sup><xref rid="fn529">32</xref></sup> However, my interpretation is correct.</p>
<p>23. YE BELIEVED HIM NOT. In your hearts.</p>
<p>NOR HEARKENED. In deed.</p>
<p>Moses then goes back to describe the prayer which he offered.<sup><xref rid="fn530">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. THY PEOPLE AND THINE INHERITANCE. Because of their fathers.<sup><xref rid="fn531">34</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>Thy people</italic> is, it is well known that they are thy people, for You took them out<sup><xref rid="fn532">35</xref></sup> by Your great power, which You demonstrated to the world.</p>
<ftnote id="fn498"><sup>1</sup> That is, soon. Israel did not pass over the Jordan the day that Moses spoke to them. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn499"><sup>2</sup> When God destroys his enemies he does so quickly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn500"><sup>3</sup> Scripture therefore goes on to say, <italic>so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn501"><sup>4</sup> For Moses goes on to castigate them in the next verse for the sins they committed in Horeb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn502"><sup>5</sup> <italic>Le-min</italic> literally means &#x201C;to from.&#x201D; Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn503"><sup>6</sup> Of superfluous letters in Scripture. See Vol. 1, p. XVII.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn504"><sup>7</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 31:18 (Vol. 2, p. 654), &#x201C;Scripture&#x2019;s statement, <italic>with the finger of God</italic> is an anthropomorphism.&#x201D; The Torah employs such language so that those who hear its words will understand.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn505"><sup>8</sup> Hebrew, <italic>mi-ketz</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn506"><sup>9</sup> According to I.E. the word <italic>mi-ketz</italic> sometimes means at the beginning and sometimes at the end. See I.E. on Num. 13:25 (Vol. 4, pp. 104,105).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn507"><sup>10</sup> For God told Moses about the calf on the day He gave Moses the tablets. I.E. assumes that had the calf been made a few days earlier, God would then have told Moses to descend from the mountain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn508"><sup>11</sup> The full text of the clause (Ex. 32:30) is, <italic>and now I will go up unto the Lord, peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn509"><sup>12</sup> That is, I fell on my face in prayer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn510"><sup>13</sup> Hence Moses says that he also prayed for Israel when they made the golden calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn511"><sup>14</sup> Our verse literally reads, until it was fine to dust (<italic>le-afar</italic>). I.E. explains that <italic>le-afar</italic> (to dust) should be interpreted as <italic>ke-afar</italic> (as dust) and our text interpreted, until it was as fine as dust (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn512"><sup>15</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. The printed texts read &#x201C;them,&#x201D; in place of &#x201C;it.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn514"><sup>17</sup> Which is located in Kadesh-barnea.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn515"><sup>18</sup> That Israel journeyed from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea (Sarim). See I.E. on Deut. 1:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn516"><sup>19</sup> Israel tested God at Massah after crossing the Red Sea. See Ex. 17:7. The incident at Taberah [where Israel murmured against God and God punished them by fire (Num. 11:3)] occurred more than a year later, after Israel had journeyed from Mount Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn517"><sup>20</sup> In Taberah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn518"><sup>21</sup> Which is what they did at Massah. Hence Taberah and Massah are mentioned back to back.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn519"><sup>22</sup> Even though Israel&#x2019;s camping at Massah came before Taberah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn520"><sup>23</sup> Israel was not punished for testing God in Massah. They were punished at Taberah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn521"><sup>24</sup> To Rephidim and attacked Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn522"><sup>25</sup> In Rephidim. Thus Israel was punished for testing God at Massah. See Ex. 17:1-7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn523"><sup>26</sup> That is, mentions the places where the following punishments took place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn524"><sup>27</sup> At Taberah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn525"><sup>28</sup> At Massah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn526"><sup>29</sup> At Kibroth-hattaavah.</ftnote>

The transmitters of tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn534">2</xref></sup> of blessed memory, said that Moses first<sup><xref rid="fn535">3</xref></sup> made another ark.<sup><xref rid="fn536">4</xref></sup> Proof of the latter is, <italic>So I made an ark</italic> (v. 3), which is followed by <italic>and hewed two tables of stone</italic> (v. 3) <italic>and put the tables in the ark which I had made</italic> (v. 5). Now their minds are superior to our minds, for it appears to us<sup><xref rid="fn537">5</xref></sup> that <italic>And the glory of the Lord abode</italic> (Ex. 24:16) is connected with the glory which the elders saw (Ex. 24:10).<sup><xref rid="fn538">6</xref></sup> We do not know when Moses ascended,<sup><xref rid="fn539">7</xref></sup> for according to the plain meaning of the text it appears that Moses fasted for only eighty days,<sup><xref rid="fn540">8</xref></sup> for the meaning of <italic>Now I stayed in the mount</italic> (v. 10) repeats what was said earlier.<sup><xref rid="fn541">9</xref></sup> It means when I stayed on the mountain during those forty days<sup><xref rid="fn542">10</xref></sup> God listened to me and said, <italic>Arise, go before the people</italic> (v. 11), the reference being to <italic>And now go, lead the people</italic> (Ex. 32:34). The making of the ark of wood (v. 3) was thus by command.<sup><xref rid="fn543">11</xref></sup> It refers to the ark made by Bezalel.<sup><xref rid="fn544">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. SO I MADE AN ARK. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn545">13</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>And Moses assembled</italic> (Ex. 35:1) should be interpreted, and Moses had assembled.<sup><xref rid="fn546">14</xref></sup> I have already shown you many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn547">15</xref></sup> All of this is necessitated<sup><xref rid="fn548">16</xref></sup> by Scripture&#x2019;s statement, <italic>and there they are, as the Lord commanded me</italic> (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn549">17</xref></sup> This<sup><xref rid="fn550">18</xref></sup> is what <italic>And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony</italic> (Ex. 25:16) refers to. It is also possible that it<sup><xref rid="fn551">19</xref></sup> refers to <italic>and make thee an ark of wood</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn552">20</xref></sup> The tradition of the sages shall triumph.</p>
<p>6. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED FROM BEEROTH-BENEJAAKAN TO MOSERAH; THERE AARON DIED. This verse is placed here<sup><xref rid="fn553">21</xref></sup> because Moses said, <italic>And I prayed for Aaron also the same time</italic> (Deut. 9:20).<sup><xref rid="fn554">22</xref></sup> Moses indicated that Aaron did not die until the fortieth year (Num. 33:38).<sup><xref rid="fn555">23</xref></sup> Moses&#x2019; statement, <italic>At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi</italic> (v. 8), which took place at Mount Sinai<sup><xref rid="fn556">24</xref></sup> as I explained in the Torah portion which opens with <italic>And The Lord Spoke</italic> (Num. 1:1),<sup><xref rid="fn557">25</xref></sup> is proof that this is its meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn558">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The early authorities<sup><xref rid="fn559">27</xref></sup> tell us that Israel backtracked.<sup><xref rid="fn560">28</xref></sup> However, what shall we do with the clause, <italic>there Aaron died, and there he was buried</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn561">29</xref></sup> Rabbi Isaac ibn Giat the Spaniard,<sup><xref rid="fn562">30</xref></sup> of blessed memory, says that the meaning of <italic>sham</italic> (there) is then.<sup><xref rid="fn563">31</xref></sup> He says that <italic>mi-sham</italic> (from thence) in <italic>misham ro&#x2019;eh</italic> (from thence, from the shepherd) (Gen. 49:24) is similar. There is no need for this interpretation. On the contrary, I believe that Beeroth-benejaakan is not to be identified with Bene-jaakkan; neither is Moserah the same as Moserot (Num. 33:31).<sup><xref rid="fn564">32</xref></sup> In reality Kadesh<sup><xref rid="fn565">33</xref></sup> is called the wilderness of Beeroth-benejaakan, and the wilderness of Mount Hor is called Moserah.<sup><xref rid="fn566">34</xref></sup> There are many such examples.<sup><xref rid="fn567">35</xref></sup> Do you not see that Scripture says the wilderness of Shur (Ex. 15:22)? However, in another place Scripture refers to it as the wilderness of Etam (Num. 33:18).<sup><xref rid="fn568">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>[7.] FROM THENCE THEY JOURNEYED UNTO GUDGOD. The latter is not to be identified with Hor-haggidgad (Num. 33:32).<sup><xref rid="fn569">37</xref></sup> On the contrary, it is a general term for Zalmonah and also for Punon and Oboth (Num. 33:43,44).<sup><xref rid="fn570">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>[TO JOTBAH.] Jotbah is the place that is also called Beer,<sup><xref rid="fn571">39</xref></sup> for Scripture reads, <italic>And from thence to Beer</italic> (Num. 21:16). This is what a <italic>land of brooks of water</italic> (v. 7) refers to, for the nobles of the people dug it with their staves and water came forth (Num. 21:18). This verse, namely, <italic>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod</italic> is connected to <italic>and Eleazar&#x2026;ministered</italic> (v. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn572">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, I have already explained to you that Israel did not offer sacrifices after they journeyed from Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn573">41</xref></sup> It is possible that they offered them when they came to Zalmonah<sup><xref rid="fn574">42</xref></sup> and Punon and that the beginning of Eleazar&#x2019;s service as high priest started in those places on Rosh Ha-Shanah.<sup><xref rid="fn575">43</xref></sup> He ministered in a place called Beer<sup><xref rid="fn576">44</xref></sup> on Yom Kippur.<sup><xref rid="fn577">45</xref></sup> The meaning of our verses<sup><xref rid="fn578">46</xref></sup> thus is, And Eleazar ministered when they came to such and such a place.<sup><xref rid="fn579">47</xref></sup> Why did Eleazar minister? Because when Israel worshipped the calf, God separated the tribe of Levi to carry the ark and to stand before the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn580">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. TO MINISTER UNTO HIM. The sons of Levi with the sons of Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn581">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND TO BLESS IN HIS NAME. For Eleazar lifted up his hands.<sup><xref rid="fn582">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. THE LORD IS HIS INHERITANCE. Its meaning is the same as <italic>O Lord, the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup</italic> (Ps. 16:5). It refers to serving God by learning His ways.<sup><xref rid="fn583">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. NOW I STAYED IN THE MOUNT. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn584">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. CAUSING THEM TO SET FORWARD. <italic>Massa</italic> (causing to set forward) is an infinitive.</p>
<p>15. AND HE CHOSE THEIR SEED. Their seed being you.<sup><xref rid="fn585">53</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>even you</italic>.</p>
<p>16. CIRCUMCISE THEREFORE THE FORESKIN OF YOUR HEART. The reference is to separation from lusts, which are as gross and leaden as a foreskin. It is also possible that it refers to cleansing the heart until one understands the truth.</p>
<p>STIFFNECKED. I have already explained the meaning of this term.<sup><xref rid="fn586">54</xref></sup> Furthermore, he earlier said, <italic>for thou art a stiffnecked people</italic> (Deut. 9:6).</p>
<p>17. GOD OF GODS. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn587">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>LORD OF LORDS. For they are on various high levels,<sup><xref rid="fn588">56</xref></sup> as in <italic>and there are higher than they</italic> (Eccles. 8:7). The one who knows these measures<sup><xref rid="fn589">57</xref></sup> is of circumcised heart.<sup><xref rid="fn590">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. HE DOTH EXECUTE JUSTICE. Even though He is exalted, He executes justice on behalf of the orphan and widow who have no one to help them, as in <italic>a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows</italic> (Ps. 68:6). He similarly loves the stranger and sustains him when he<sup><xref rid="fn591">59</xref></sup> relies on Him. Now, since God loves the stranger, you too are obligated to love him.</p>
<p>20. THOU SHALT FEAR THE LORD THY GOD. You shall not violate the negative commandments.</p>
<p>HIM SHALT THOU SERVE. By observing the positive commandments.</p>
<p>AND TO HIM SHALT THOU CLEAVE. With your heart.</p>
<p>AND BY HIS NAME SHALT THOU SWEAR. With your mouth<sup><xref rid="fn592">60</xref></sup> as Scripture explains.<sup><xref rid="fn593">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. HE IS THY GLORY. Its meaning is, you should glorify yourself in Him, for He did these tremendous things for you.</p>
<p>22. WITH THREE SCORE AND TEN. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn594">62</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn533"><sup>1</sup> In Deut. 9:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn534"><sup>2</sup> The Talmudic sages.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn535"><sup>3</sup> Before ascending Mount Sinai to receive the second tablets. See <italic>Tanchuma</italic>, Ex. 1:10, and Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn536"><sup>4</sup> That is, other than the one later made by Bezalel. Thus the ark mentioned in our verse is not to be identified with the ark made by Bezalel which was placed in the Holy of Holies (Ex. 25:1-22; 37:1-9). The sages believed that God gave Moses the second pair of tablets at the end of 80 days and that Moses made an ark to hold them temporarily. See Rashi on our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn537"><sup>5</sup> Contrary to their opinion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn538"><sup>6</sup> Ex 24:16-18 reads: <italic>And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days; and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the</italic> cloud&#x2026;<italic>And Moses entered in the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount; and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights</italic>. According to the rabbis this verse relates to the giving of Torah (see Rashi on Ex. 24:16). Also, according to the rabbis, the forty days which this verse states Moses spent on the mountain starts with the seventh of Sivan. There are 120 days between that day and Yom Kippur when, according to Rabbinic tradition, Moses descended with the second pair of tablets. Moses thus spent 120 days on Mount Sinai. See <italic>Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer</italic>, chapter 46. I.E. disagrees. He believes that the plain meaning of the text does not allow one to conclude that Moses spent 120 days on Mount Sinai. The text merely says that the elders of Israel ascended Mount Sinai and had a vision of God (Ex. 24:1-12). It does not say which day they descended. Following this vision the cloud covered the mountain for seven days, after which God called Moses to ascend the mountain for 40 days. We thus do no know what day Moses ascended the mountain, and therefore, cannot calculate 120 days between revelation and Yom Kippur. Thus Moses did not necessarily spend 120 days on Mount Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn539"><sup>7</sup> To receive the tablets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn540"><sup>8</sup> According to the rabbis, <italic>Now I stayed in the mount, as the first time forty days and forty nights</italic> is not a repetition of Deut. 9:25 but speaks of an additional 40 days. Furthermore, <italic>as the first time forty days and forty nights</italic> indicates that as he fasted the first time, so did he now.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn541"><sup>9</sup> In Deut. 9:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn542"><sup>10</sup> Mentioned in Deut. 9:25.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn545"><sup>13</sup> By commanding Bezalel to make it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn546"><sup>14</sup> Ex. 35:1 tells us that Moses gathered the people and told them to make the tabernacle and its furniture, the ark included. Ex. 35 follows the account of the giving of the second tablets, which is recorded in Ex. 34. Now, since I.E. believes that the ark spoken of in our chapter is to be identified with the ark made by Bezalel, he interprets <italic>And Moses assembled</italic> as And Moses had assembled Israel; that is, Moses gathered Israel and commanded them to make the tabernacle before he ascended Mount Sinai a second time to receive the second tablets.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn548"><sup>16</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn551"><sup>19</sup> <italic>As the Lord commanded me</italic> (v. 5).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn552"><sup>20</sup> In other words, verse 5 does not refer to the command recorded in Ex. 25:16. It thus does not speak of the ark made by Bezalel. Therefore our verse does not contradict the Rabbinic tradition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn553"><sup>21</sup> Amidst the account of the golden calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn554"><sup>22</sup> Saying, <italic>And I prayed for Aaron also at that time</italic>, Moses indicated that Aaron did not go along with those who worshipped the calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn555"><sup>23</sup> And not after the incident of the golden calf, for God accepted Moses&#x2019; prayer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn556"><sup>24</sup> Not after the death of Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn557"><sup>25</sup> See I.E. on Num. 3:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn558"><sup>26</sup> That our verse is a parenthetical statement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn559"><sup>27</sup> The rabbis of the Talmud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn560"><sup>28</sup> According to Num. 20:22-29, Aaron died at Mount Hor, not at Moserah. Furthermore, Num. 33:31 tells us that Israel journeyed from Moseroth to Bene-jaakan. The rabbis identify Bene-jaakan with Beeroth-benejaakan and Moserah with Moseroth. Additionally, the rabbis identify Hor-haggidgad (Num. 33:32) with Gudgod (v. 7). Thus according to the rabbis, verses 6 and 7 contradict Num. 33:31,32. The rabbis solve the contradictions by saying that Israel backtracked from Mount Hor to Moserah. See Rashi: &#x201C;Moses reproved Israel saying that when Aaron died on Mount Hor at the end of 40 years and the clouds of glory departed you feared war with the king of Arad, and you appointed a leader that you might return to Egypt, and you turned backwards 8 stages unto Bene-jaakan and from there to Moserah. There the sons of Levi fought with you, and they slew some of you, and you some of them, until they forced you back on the road along which you had retreated. From Moserah you returned to Gudgod, (Num. 33:33), that is identical with Hor-haggidgad (v. 8).&#x201D; Also, see <italic>Yerushalmi Sotah</italic>, chapter 1, Hal. 10; <italic>Yoma</italic>, Chap 1, Hal. 1; <italic>Seder Olam</italic>, chapter 9.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn563"><sup>31</sup> At that time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn564"><sup>32</sup> Thus our verse does not contradict Num. 33:31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn565"><sup>33</sup> Not Bene-jaakan, for Num. 33:37 relates that Israel journeyed from Kadesh to Mount Hor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn566"><sup>34</sup> Hence our verse does not contradict Num. 20:22-29.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn571"><sup>39</sup> Hebrew, <italic>be&#x2019;er</italic> (well). It is not to be identified with Jotbah in Num. 33:33 to which Israel journeyed from Hor-haggidgad.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn572"><sup>40</sup> In other words, Israel did not backtrack after Aaron&#x2019;s death, for the journey to Gudgod, took place after Aaron died. See note 28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn573"><sup>41</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 29:42 (Vol. 2, p. 621).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn574"><sup>42</sup> According to I.E. on verse 7, Gudgod is a general name for Zalmonah and Punon. Now, since <italic>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod</italic> is connected to <italic>and Eleazar&#x2026;</italic> it follows that Eleazar started to serve as high priest there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn575"><sup>43</sup> Aaron died on the first day of the fifth month (Num. 33:39). Moses waited until the new year began, on the first day of the seventh month, for Eleazar to begin serving as <italic>kohen gadol</italic> (high priest).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn577"><sup>45</sup> Hence Gudgod and Jotbah are mentioned after <italic>and Eleazar&#x2026;ministered</italic>. In other words, verses 6 and 7 are to be interpreted, and Eleazar ministered in Gudgod and in Jotbah.</ftnote>

<p>[1. THEREFORE THOU SHALT LOVE THE LORD.] Since the Lord multiplied you, you are obligated to love Him. Our verse adds <italic>always</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn595">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. I SPEAK NOT WITH YOUR CHILDREN THAT HAVE NOT KNOWN. The answer is<sup><xref rid="fn596">2</xref></sup>, <italic>but your eyes have seen</italic> (v. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn597">3</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn598">4</xref></sup> means these wonders are not future phenomena which your children shall see. On the contrary, you yourselves have witnessed them.</p>
<p>HIS GREATNESS, HIS MIGHTY HAND, AND HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM. In taking you out of Egypt.</p>
<p>3. AND HIS SIGNS, AND HIS WORKS. <italic>Unto Pharaoh</italic>, for he was most important.<sup><xref rid="fn599">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. HE MADE&#x2026;TO OVERFLOW. The word <italic>hetzif</italic> (made to overflow) is related to the word <italic>tzafu</italic> (flowed)<sup><xref rid="fn600">6</xref></sup> in <italic>Waters flowed over my head</italic> (Lam. 3:54).</p>
<p>DESTROYED THEM. Its meaning is, their children did not arise in their place to be like them.<sup><xref rid="fn601">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND WHAT HE DID UNTO YOU IN THE WILDERNESS. The reference is to the manna.</p>
<p>6. AND THEIR HOUSEHOLDS.<sup><xref rid="fn602">8</xref></sup> The reference is to their wives and to their children.</p>
<p>AND EVERY LIVING SUBSTANCE. <italic>Yekum</italic> (substance) is an all-inclusive term.<sup><xref rid="fn603">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT FOLLOWED THEM. <italic>Be-raglehem</italic> (that followed them) means because of them.<sup><xref rid="fn604">10</xref></sup> On the other hand, the term may be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn605">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since you have seen all of this,<sup><xref rid="fn606">12</xref></sup> take heed so that you observe God&#x2019;s commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn607">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND POSSESS. The <italic>resh</italic> in <italic>vi-yerishtem</italic> (and possess) is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic><sup><xref rid="fn608">14</xref></sup> because the <italic>vav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn609">15</xref></sup> is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>.</p>
<p>10. FOR THE LAND. Here is another reason why you are obligated to observe God&#x2019;s commandments. The land is not like the land of Egypt. On the contrary, the land needs God to keep His eye on it.<sup><xref rid="fn610">16</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse can be understood with the following parable. The Lord will act like a person who sees all that the land needs and will give everything in its time.</p>
<p>12. FROM THE BEGINNING. <italic>Me-reshit</italic> (from the beginning) is spelled without an <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn611">17</xref></sup> There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn612">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture therefore<sup><xref rid="fn613">19</xref></sup> goes on to say, <italic>And it shall come to pass</italic> (v. 13); and <italic>I will give the rain of your land in its season</italic> (v. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn614">20</xref></sup> This is what Scripture means by the eyes of <italic>the Lord are always upon it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn615">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>AND THE LATTER RAIN. The meaning of <italic>malkosh</italic> (the latter rain) is known.<sup><xref rid="fn618">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THOU SHALT EAT AND BE SATISFIED. This refers to <italic>thy corn, and thy wine</italic> (v. 14), not to that which comes immediately before it<sup><xref rid="fn619">25</xref></sup> namely, <italic>grass in thy fields</italic>.</p>
<p>17. HER FRUIT. I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>yevulah</italic> (her fruit).<sup><xref rid="fn620">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND YE PERISH QUICKLY. They will be exiled from the land like those who perish in hunger.<sup><xref rid="fn621">27</xref></sup> Now, since the land is good, you are therefore obligated to take these words to heart.<sup><xref rid="fn622">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. FOR FRONTLETS. Its meaning has been explained.<sup><xref rid="fn623">29</xref></sup> If you will take My words to heart, you will not be exiled from the land, and your days upon the land shall be as long as the days of the heaven above the earth.</p>
<p>22. FOR IF YE SHALL DILIGENTLY KEEP. The meaning of our verse is: I told you that you will quickly be driven from the good land.<sup><xref rid="fn624">30</xref></sup> Know that you will not initially enter the land, and you will not be victorious if you do not keep the commandments of God.<sup><xref rid="fn625">31</xref></sup></p>

<p>27. THE BLESSING, IF YE SHALL HEARKEN. For if you hearken, behold, you are blessed.<sup><xref rid="fn630">36</xref></sup> A blessing means an addition of the good.<sup><xref rid="fn631">37</xref></sup> A curse means a diminution.<sup><xref rid="fn632">38</xref></sup> The word <italic>kelalah</italic> (curse) is related to the word <italic>kallah</italic> (light).<sup><xref rid="fn633">39</xref></sup></p>

<p>OVER AGAINST. The word <italic>mul</italic> means over against.</p>

<ftnote id="fn595"><sup>1</sup> Thus our verse does not merely repeat Deut. 10:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn596"><sup>2</sup> The question raised by our verse is, &#x201C;If God did not speak with their children, to whom was He speaking?&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn597"><sup>3</sup> In other words, verse 7 concludes the thought raised in our verse. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that our verse is to be understood, I speak not with your children&#x2026;but with you whose eyes have seen the great deeds that God wrought.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn598"><sup>4</sup> &#x2026;<italic>but your eyes have seen</italic> (v. 7).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn599"><sup>5</sup> Our verse mentions Pharaoh, either because he was the most important Egyptian or because he was the main source of Israel&#x2019;s trouble (Weiser).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn601"><sup>7</sup> Our verse tells us that God destroyed the Egyptians <italic>unto this day</italic>. However, the Egyptians were not wiped off the face of the earth. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation that the meaning of our verse is, God destroyed the type of Egyptians who enslaved and pursued the Israelites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn602"><sup>8</sup> Literally, and their houses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn603"><sup>9</sup> <italic>Yekum</italic> usually applies to living creatures. I.E. points out that here it applies to all sorts of property.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn614"><sup>20</sup> That is, Scripture states that God will give rain in its season if Israel observes God&#x2019;s laws, because the land requires God&#x2019;s supervision. God will care for the land if Israel observes His commandments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn615"><sup>21</sup> It means that God looks upon the land to see whether the inhabitants are observing His laws.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn616"><sup>22</sup> The word <italic>yoreh</italic> literally means to show or teach.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn617"><sup>23</sup> The early rain is an indicator of an abundance of rain.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn624"><sup>30</sup> If you worship idols.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn625"><sup>31</sup> The section dealing with exile from the land precedes our section. Scripture in effect says: not only will you be exiled from the land if in the future you worship idols, but if you do so now, you will not even be permitted to enter the land.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn629"><sup>35</sup> The word <italic>re&#x2019;eh</italic> (behold) is in the singular. That which follows is in the plural. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn642"><sup>48</sup> Gilgal received its name in the days of Joshua. See Josh. 5:9. The question thus arises how could Moses employ a name which was not in existence during his lifetime. Hence I.E. points out that our verse is similar to Gen. 14:14. There, Scripture uses the term Dan with regard to an episode in the life of Abraham, even though the place could not have had this name in Abraham&#x2019;s time, for Dan was named after the son of Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn643"><sup>49</sup> That Moses used the name Gilgal prophetically.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn644"><sup>50</sup> Two places with the same name. Gilgal in Josh. 5:9 is not the same as the Gilgal mentioned in our verse. The same would apply to Dan in Gen. 14:14.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 12</title>
<p>2. YE SHALL SURELY DESTROY ALL THE PLACES&#x2026;THEIR GODS. Rabbi Jonah the grammarian says that <italic>et elohehem</italic> (their gods) is lacking a <italic>vav</italic>, for the meaning of the phrase is, and their gods.<sup><xref rid="fn646">1</xref></sup> However, he contributes nothing.<sup><xref rid="fn647">2</xref></sup> <italic>Et elohehem</italic> is most certainly connected to <italic>asher avedu sham</italic> (wherein they served).<sup><xref rid="fn648">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVERY LEAFY TREE. The words <italic>ra&#x2019;anan</italic> (leafy) and <italic>sha&#x2019;anan</italic> (at peace) are always spelled with two <italic>nuns</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn649">4</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ra&#x2019;anan</italic> is wet.<sup><xref rid="fn650">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. THEIR ASHERIM. <italic>Asherim</italic> are trees.</p>
<p>AND YE SHALL DESTROY THEIR NAME. So that they not be mentioned.</p>
<p>4. YE SHALL NOT DO SO. This means do not sacrifice on the hills and the mountains. Do so only in the place where the Lord shall put His name.</p>
<p>5. TO PUT HIS NAME THERE. Compare, <italic>Where I cause My name to be mentioned</italic> (Ex. 20:21).</p>
<p>EVEN UNTO HIS HABITATIONS SHALL YE SEEK. The reference is to the land, that is, to the place where God&#x2019;s glory dwells.<sup><xref rid="fn651">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND THERE YE SHALL EAT. The <italic>kohanim</italic> and the Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn652">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. YE SHALL NOT DO AFTER ALL THAT WE DO HERE THIS DAY. Scripture states this because they were journeying from station to station.<sup><xref rid="fn653">8</xref></sup> After Aaron&#x2019;s death some would sacrifice a burnt offering in any one of the stations that he desired to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn654">9</xref></sup> Some would present the first-born of the flock. Others did not, for the commandment<sup><xref rid="fn655">10</xref></sup> is contingent upon the Land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn656">11</xref></sup> However, this is not my opinion. Its meaning,<sup><xref rid="fn657">12</xref></sup> rather, is that not all of them feared God. Now, Moses said &#x201C;we&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn658">13</xref></sup> because, as Scripture clearly states, he made the many commandments regarding the burnt offering contingent upon the Land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn659">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>[9. TO THE REST.] So that they and their children do not have to travel.<sup><xref rid="fn660">15</xref></sup> This is the meaning of inheritance.<sup><xref rid="fn661">16</xref></sup> However, actually the meaning of <italic>the rest</italic> is, <italic>and giveth you rest</italic> (v. 10),<sup><xref rid="fn662">17</xref></sup> and <italic>the inheritance</italic> refers to <italic>so that ye dwell in safety</italic> (v. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn663">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND ALL YOUR CHOICE VOWS. The commandment requires that offerings made by vows be brought from the choicest.<sup><xref rid="fn664">19</xref></sup> Behold, another addition, namely, <italic>And ye shall rejoice</italic><sup><xref rid="fn665">20</xref></sup> (v. 12).</p>
<p>[12.] AND THE LEVITE. You are obligated to make the Levite happy, for he does not have an inheritance as you do. Scripture repeats <italic>in every place that thou seest</italic><sup><xref rid="fn666">21</xref></sup> (v. 13) because it wants to exclude meat eaten out of desire.<sup><xref rid="fn667">22</xref></sup> Scripture states the unclean and the clean (v. 15) with regard to meat eaten out of desire because peace offerings are sacred and one who eats sacred meat in a state of impurity incurs the penalty of excision.<sup><xref rid="fn668">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AS OF THE GAZELLE, AND AS OF THE HART. Which are not offered on the altar. The fat of the gazelle and also that of the hart, is permitted. Look, this is proof of my words.<sup><xref rid="fn669">24</xref></sup> However, we rely on the tradition of our fathers.<sup><xref rid="fn670">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THOU MAYEST NOT EAT WITHIN THY GATES THE TITHE OF THY CORN. Moses speaks to the Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn671">26</xref></sup> According to many he also speaks to the Israelites regarding the second tithe.<sup><xref rid="fn672">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR THE FIRSTLINGS OF THY HERD OR OF THY FLOCK. Moses speaks to the <italic>kohanim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn673">28</xref></sup> for the Levites and also the <italic>kohanim</italic> are included among the Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn674">29</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And I commanded you</italic> (Deut. 3:18) wherein Moses speaks to two and a half tribes. Similarly, Moses speaks to Israel when he says, <italic>the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem</italic> (Num. 18:15), which means the one who is obligated to redeem.<sup><xref rid="fn675">30</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>Thou mayest not eat within thy gates</italic><sup><xref rid="fn676">31</xref></sup> and <italic>but thou shalt eat them before the Lord thy God</italic> (v. 18) refer to the one who is obligated to eat.<sup><xref rid="fn677">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The heretics<sup><xref rid="fn678">33</xref></sup> say that there are two sorts of first-born. One is the first to break out of its mother&#x2019;s womb. The second is the first-born of the flock.<sup><xref rid="fn679">34</xref></sup> There is no need to respond to their nonsense. There are also others who say that if an Israelite is in the chosen place, then he eats the first-born and the tithe. However, this is the reverse of what Scripture says.<sup><xref rid="fn680">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>[20. BECAUSE THY SOUL DESIRETH TO EAT FLESH.] This means, if your soul desires to eat flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn681">36</xref></sup> Moses already mentioned this.<sup><xref rid="fn682">37</xref></sup> He repeats himself in order to add, <italic>If the place&#x2026;be too far from thee</italic> (v. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn683">38</xref></sup> Furthermore, this verse speaks of a place that is not part of the land of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn684">39</xref></sup> Its law is the same as the law within your gates.<sup><xref rid="fn685">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. FOR THE BLOOD IS THE LIFE. I have explained this previously.<sup><xref rid="fn686">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. THAT IT MAY GO WELL WITH THEE. A person should not eat the soul [blood] of an animal for it will harm his soul.<sup><xref rid="fn687">42</xref></sup> Also, one&#x2019;s soul and form are in the image of the father.<sup><xref rid="fn688">43</xref></sup> Scripture therefore states, <italic>and with thy children after thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn689">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. ONLY THY HOLY THINGS. Burnt offerings, peace offerings, and vow offerings.</p>
<p>THOU SHALT TAKE.<sup><xref rid="fn690">45</xref></sup> This means bring them<sup><xref rid="fn691">46</xref></sup> to the chosen place.</p>
<p>27. AND THOU SHALT EAT THE FLESH. Moses speaks to the <italic>kohen</italic> concerning<sup><xref rid="fn692">47</xref></sup> a first-born, a sin offering, a guilt offering, or the shoulder or breast.<sup><xref rid="fn693">48</xref></sup> If the <italic>kohen</italic> eats from a peace offering, the major part belongs to the Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn694">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>[28. OBSERVE AND HEAR.] <italic>Observe and hear</italic> means, observe and hear the law regarding the blood which is to be poured on the altar.</p>
<p>29. WHEN THE LORD&#x2026;SHALL CUT OFF. This section<sup><xref rid="fn695">50</xref></sup> also is connected to <italic>When the Lord&#x2026;shall enlarge thy border</italic> (v. 20), for if Israel does not conquer the nations, God will not enlarge Israel&#x2019;s border.</p>
<p>[30. AND THAT&#x2026;NOT.] <italic>U-fen</italic> (and that&#x2026;not) introduces an abridged clause. So that you will follow their practices [has been omitted].<sup><xref rid="fn696">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVEN SO WILL I DO LIKEWISE. In the service of the Lord, and you will think that you are doing good. You shall not act in this manner, for God despises all their ways. <italic>For even their sons&#x2026;do they burn in the fire to their gods</italic> is proof of the latter. That which I commanded you, that shall you observe to do.<sup><xref rid="fn697">52</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn646"><sup>1</sup> Rabbi Jonah maintains that our verse should be read: Ye shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess served, &#x201C;and&#x201D; their gods. He interprets this as meaning, You shall surely destroy all the places wherein the nations that you are to dispossess worshipped. You shall also destroy their gods.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn647"><sup>2</sup> For as I.E. goes on to note, <italic>et elohehem</italic> is connected to <italic>asher avedu sham</italic> (wherein they served).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn648"><sup>3</sup> For our text reads, <italic>et elohehem</italic> (their gods) not <italic>ve-et elohehem</italic> (and their gods). I.E. feels that there is no reason to interpret <italic>et</italic> as if written <italic>ve-et</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn649"><sup>4</sup> I.E. apparently believed that the root of <italic>sha&#x2019;anan</italic> is <italic>shin, alef, nun</italic> and that of <italic>ra&#x2019;anan is resh, ayin, nun</italic>. Hence he points out that in <italic>ra&#x2019;anan</italic> and <italic>sha&#x2019;anan</italic> the final root letter is doubled. See Radak, <italic>Sefer Ha-sharoshim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn650"><sup>5</sup> Full of sap, as in a leafy tree.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn651"><sup>6</sup> The land containing the tabernacle, where God&#x2019;s glory dwells.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn652"><sup>7</sup> For Scripture goes on to speak of food that may not be eaten by Israelites. See I.E. on verse 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn653"><sup>8</sup> On their way to the Land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn654"><sup>9</sup> After Aaron&#x2019;s death the bringing of sacrifices was optional. Hence some brought sacrifices; others did not.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn655"><sup>10</sup> To offer sacrifices. After Aaron&#x2019;s death the bringing of sacrifices was optional. Hence some brought sacrifices others did not. Thus every man did whatsoever was right in his eyes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn656"><sup>11</sup> Hence Scripture tells the Israelites that once they enter the Land of Israel, they must offer the sacrifices that Scripture commands.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn657"><sup>12</sup> The meaning of, <italic>Ye shall not do after all that we do here this day. Every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn658"><sup>13</sup> Even though Moses was not included among those who did not fear the Lord. The first part of the verse, where the term &#x201C;we&#x201D; is found, applies to the laws which Israel did not observe in the wilderness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn659"><sup>14</sup> The burnt offering is representative of all laws in force only in the Land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn660"><sup>15</sup> From place to place. In other words, the reference is to when Israel settled in the Land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn661"><sup>16</sup> The word inheritance (<italic>nachalah</italic>) explains rest (<italic>menuchah</italic>). <italic>Nachalah</italic> refers to a place of final settlement. So does <italic>menuchah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn662"><sup>17</sup> After Israel has conquered the entire Land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn663"><sup>18</sup> After conquering the land. According to the first interpretation <italic>rest</italic> refers to being in the land. According to the second interpretation it refers to living securely in the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn664"><sup>19</sup> Of the animals. The point is that our verse does not repeat, for it adds that vows be brought from among the choicest of the animals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn665"><sup>20</sup> In addition to telling us that vows are to be offered from the choicest animals, it also commands the laws of rejoicing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn666"><sup>21</sup> After having stated this already in verse 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn667"><sup>22</sup> Meat which is not sacred.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn668"><sup>23</sup> That is, the law of clean and unclean does not apply to the eating of nonsacred meat (v. 15).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn669"><sup>24</sup> I.E. believes that, according to the plain meaning of the text, only the fat of an animal that has actually been offered on the altar is forbidden. See I.E. on Lev. 7:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn670"><sup>25</sup> According to the rabbis of the Talmud the fat of an animal that may be offered on the altar is forbidden.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn671"><sup>26</sup> For our verse speaks of the first tithe.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn672"><sup>27</sup> According to this interpretation the tithe spoken of in our verse refers to the first and the second tithe.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn673"><sup>28</sup> Only they may eat of the first-born.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn674"><sup>29</sup> Hence Scripture does not specify that it is speaking to the Levites or the <italic>kohanim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn675"><sup>30</sup> The import of the verse is, those among you who are obligated to redeem, shall redeem. Similarly, the previous verse speaks only to those Israelites to whom it applies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn676"><sup>31</sup> In our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn677"><sup>32</sup> Not to all Israelites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn678"><sup>33</sup> The Karaites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn679"><sup>34</sup> Which any Israelite may eat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn680"><sup>35</sup> Elsewhere Scripture states that an Israelite may not eat the first tithe or the first -born of the flock and sheep.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn681"><sup>36</sup> In other words, the term <italic>ki</italic> (because) has the meaning of if here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn682"><sup>37</sup> In verse 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn683"><sup>38</sup> This verse teaches that they may eat non-sacred meat outside the sanctuary only if they are far from it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn684"><sup>39</sup> Verse 15 speaks of the Land of Israel. However, our verse speaks of the land beyond the borders of Israel. Thus our verse teaches that it is permitted to slaughter cattle for meat beyond the borders of the Holy Land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn685"><sup>40</sup> That is, the law regarding the eating of non-sacred meat outside the land of Canaan is the same as the law dealing with the eating of non-sacred meat within the gates of the cities in the land of Canaan. See verse 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn686"><sup>41</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 9:4 (Vol. 1, p. 122).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn687"><sup>42</sup> According to Ibn Ezra the eating of anything which the Torah proscribes has a deleterious effect on the soul.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn688"><sup>43</sup> A person&#x2019;s soul and form are in the image of his father.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 13</title>
<p>2. IF THERE ARISE IN THE MIDST OF THEE. Scripture reads <italic>in the midst of thee</italic> because there is no prophet except from among Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn698">1</xref></sup> This section is connected to the previous one<sup><xref rid="fn699">2</xref></sup> because they both deal with idol worship, for the burning of the children (Deut. 12:31) was an act of idol worship.</p>
<p>Our verse deals with a prophet who claims that God, or God&#x2019;s messenger, spoke to him while he was awake or in a dream. Some say that it is possible that the prophet<sup><xref rid="fn700">3</xref></sup> was one of those who steal God&#x2019;s word (Jer. 26:30). They explain that a true prophet said that a certain sign would appear to verify his word.<sup><xref rid="fn701">4</xref></sup> Someone heard this and related the sign so that it should bear witness for him.<sup><xref rid="fn702">5</xref></sup> Others say that even if the sign or a wonder came to pass<sup><xref rid="fn703">6</xref></sup> we do not believe him,<sup><xref rid="fn704">7</xref></sup> for what he says<sup><xref rid="fn705">8</xref></sup> contradicts reason.<sup><xref rid="fn706">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that the terms wonder<sup><xref rid="fn707">10</xref></sup> and sign<sup><xref rid="fn708">11</xref></sup> apply also<sup><xref rid="fn709">12</xref></sup> to symbolic acts.<sup><xref rid="fn710">13</xref></sup> Compare, the words of the prophet Isaiah: <italic>Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me shall be for signs and for wonders</italic> (Is. 8:18); the sign of the prophet<sup><xref rid="fn711">14</xref></sup> in <italic>Like as My servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot</italic> (Is. 20:3);<sup><xref rid="fn712">15</xref></sup> the names of his children, which served as signs regarding things that would occur in their lifetime, namely, Emanuel (Is. 7:14); Maher-shalal-hash-baz (Is. 8:3); Shearjashub (Is. 7:3). Also Scripture&#x2019;s statement with regard to the plagues,<sup><xref rid="fn713">16</xref></sup> <italic>And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder</italic> (Deut. 28:46). There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn714">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. [PUTTETH YOU TO PROOF.] Scripture says, <italic>for the Lord&#x2026;putteth you to proof</italic>, because God left the prophet<sup><xref rid="fn715">18</xref></sup> alone and did not kill him. The purpose of God&#x2019;s test is to show the righteousness of the one who is being tried.<sup><xref rid="fn716">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AFTER THE LORD YOUR GOD SHALL YE WALK. You shall do your utmost to imitate God&#x2019;s deeds and pursue His paths.</p>
<p>AND HIM SHALL YE FEAR. You shall refrain from asking why this is so.<sup><xref rid="fn717">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HIS COMMANDMENTS SHALL YE KEEP. The commandments which are most important.<sup><xref rid="fn718">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND UNTO HIS VOICE SHALL YE HEARKEN. This refers to precepts which recall that which is most important.<sup><xref rid="fn719">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HIM SHALL YE SERVE. In deed.</p>
<p>AND UNTO HIM SHALL YE CLEAVE. With your heart. In the beginning and at the end.<sup><xref rid="fn720">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. BECAUSE HE HATH SPOKEN PERVERSION. The word <italic>davar</italic> (thing) has been omitted from our clause.<sup><xref rid="fn721">24</xref></sup> <italic>But in the multitude of counselors established</italic><sup><xref rid="fn722">25</xref></sup> (Prov. 15:22) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn723">26</xref></sup> Scripture reads <italic>sarah</italic> (perversion) because God commanded Israel to turn away (<italic>la-sur</italic>) from idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn724">27</xref></sup> On the other hand, the word <italic>sarah</italic> might be related to the word <italic>soreh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn725">28</xref></sup> (defiant) in <italic>defiant</italic><sup><xref rid="fn726">29</xref></sup> <italic>and rebellious</italic> (Deut. 21:20). The latter interpretation is correct. The <italic>resh</italic> should have received a <italic>dagesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn727">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, AND REDEEMED THEE OUT OF THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE. Scripture repeats itself for the sake of emphasis.</p>
<p>SO SHALT THOU PUT AWAY. I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>u-vi&#x2019;arta</italic> (so thou put away).<sup><xref rid="fn728">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. IF THY BROTHER&#x2026;ENTICE THEE. This means even thy brother.<sup><xref rid="fn729">32</xref></sup> The import of <italic>thy mother</italic> is, you<sup><xref rid="fn730">33</xref></sup> were in one womb. The mother is like matter and the father is like form.<sup><xref rid="fn731">34</xref></sup> Very few people understand the nature of form.</p>
<p>9. THOU SHALT NOT CONSENT UNTO HIM. By believing in your heart.</p>
<p>NOR HEARKEN UNTO HIM. In deed.</p>
<p>NEITHER SHALL THINE EYE PITY HIM. You shall not refrain from killing him.</p>
<p>NEITHER SHALT THOU CONCEAL HIM. You shall not leave him alone but you shall reveal the matter until witnesses hear it<sup><xref rid="fn732">35</xref></sup> from his mouth, as is stated in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn733">36</xref></sup> You shall then kill him.</p>
<p>10. THY HAND SHALL BE FIRST UPON HIM. Were it not for tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn734">37</xref></sup> it would appear that the reference<sup><xref rid="fn735">38</xref></sup> is to the two witnesses.</p>
<p>11. AND THOU SHALT STONE HIM. Scripture explains the manner of his death.</p>
<p>15. THEN SHALT THOU INQUIRE, AND MAKE SEARCH, AND ASK DILIGENTLY. These words are well explained in the writings of our rabbis of blessed memory.<sup><xref rid="fn736">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. EVERY WHIT. Completely to the Lord your God.<sup><xref rid="fn737">40</xref></sup> You shall bum it in fire because of God&#x2019;s honor.<sup><xref rid="fn738">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>A HEAP. The word <italic>tel</italic> (heap) is related to <italic>talul</italic> (heaped) in <italic>upon a high mountain and heaped</italic> (Ezek. 17:22).<sup><xref rid="fn739">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. THAT THE LORD MAY TURN FROM THE FIERCENESS OF HIS ANGER. And He will not destroy you because of the sins of that city.</p>
<p>[19. WHEN THOU SHALT HEARKEN.] The meaning of <italic>When</italic><sup><xref rid="fn740">43</xref></sup> <italic>thou shalt hearken</italic> is, thus shall you do if you desire to do what is right in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>The section which opens with <italic>Ye are children of the Lord</italic> (Deut. 14:1) is connected to this section because of the enticers,<sup><xref rid="fn741">44</xref></sup> namely, a brother, a sister, and a son or daughter (v. 7), or the inhabitants of the idol-worshipping city (v. 14). It is prohibited to mourn for them,<sup><xref rid="fn742">45</xref></sup> and it is certainly prohibited to cut oneself,<sup><xref rid="fn743">46</xref></sup> for behold, that is prohibited over any deceased.<sup><xref rid="fn744">47</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn698"><sup>1</sup> Prophesy is found only among Israelites. I.E. considered Balaam an astrologer who claimed to be a prophet. See I.E. on Num. 22:28 (Vol. 4, p. 186). This is also the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi. See Book I of the Kuzari.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn710"><sup>13</sup> The terms <italic>mofet</italic> (wonder) and <italic>ot</italic> (sign) usually refer to a miraculous act such as changing a rod into a serpent or water into blood. However, it may also refer to an act which illustrates what the prophet predicts will happen. According to I.E. the sign spoken of in our verse refers to the latter. Hence Scripture speaks of the sign coming to pass; i.e., the act played out by the prophet came to be.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn711"><sup>14</sup> Isaiah gave his sons names which alluded to that which would occur in the future. Thus he named one son Immanuel (God is with us) to indicate that Judah would survive.

<ftnote id="fn717"><sup>20</sup> A person must observe the commandments even if he does not understand the reasons for them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn718"><sup>21</sup> Such as belief in God. See chapter 5 of <italic>Yesod Mora</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn719"><sup>22</sup> Some commandments serve as reminders of the most important precepts. For example, the Sabbath commemorates creation.

<ftnote id="fn721"><sup>24</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>ki dibber sarah</italic> (for he hath spoken perversion). <italic>Sarah</italic> is an adjective. Hence I.E. notes that the word which <italic>sarah</italic> is describing has been omitted. Our text is to be interpreted as if written, <italic>ki dibber davar sarah</italic>. I.E. interprets the latter as, for he has spoken words commanding us to turn away from the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn722"><sup>25</sup> Translated according to I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn723"><sup>26</sup> Our text should be read as if written: But in the multitude of counselors, counsel is established.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn729"><sup>32</sup> <italic>If thy&#x2026;brother entice thee</italic> is to be understood as even if your brother entices you, for the law applies to anyone who entices you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn730"><sup>33</sup> And your brother were in one womb. Thus the meaning of our verse is, even if your brother who was in one womb with you entices you. Our verse speaks of <italic>thy brother, the son of thy mother</italic>. This is an appellation rarely used in Scripture. The question thus arises, &#x201C;Why did Scripture add <italic>the son of thy mother</italic>?&#x201D; Furthermore, why did the Torah not describe the brother as the son of thy father? Hence I.E. comments that the matter from which a person is made comes from the mother; the father&#x2019;s sperm (so I.E. believed) shapes the matter. Thus a person, biologically speaking, is closer to a brother from a mother than to a brother from a father, and probably has closer emotional ties to him. Hence Scripture states, even if your brother who is made of the same matter as you entices you, do not listen to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn731"><sup>34</sup> Form gives shape to matter. Form is intangible. Different men will give different form to the matter produced by the same woman. However, all of the children will share the same matter. Hence Scripture speaks of <italic>thy mother</italic> not thy father.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 14</title>
<p>1. YE SHALL NOT CUT YOURSELVES. <italic>Titgodedu</italic> (ye shall not cut yourselves) means the same as <italic>ve-seret</italic> (cuttings) in <italic>cuttings&#x2026;for the dead</italic> (Lev. 19:28).<sup><xref rid="fn745">1</xref></sup> <italic>Titgodedu</italic> is related to the word <italic>gedudot<sup><xref rid="fn746">2</xref></sup></italic> (cuttings) in <italic>Upon all the hands are cuttings</italic> (Jer. 48:37).</p>
<p>NOR MAKE ANY BALDNESS. As the nations do unto this very day.</p>
<p>[CHILDREN.] The meaning of <italic>children</italic> is, now that you know that you are children of God and that the Lord loves you more than a father loves his son, do not cut yourselves over anything that God does, for whatever the Lord does is for the good. If you do not understand God,<sup><xref rid="fn747">3</xref></sup> then act like small children who do not understand what their father does but nevertheless rely upon him. <italic>For thou art a holy people</italic> (v. 2) and you are not like all the Canaanites. You shall therefore not imitate their practices.</p>
<p>The section opening with the words <italic>Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing</italic> (v. 3) follows because Scripture says, as it were, you are holy in your heart and in your mouth. You shall be separated from the nations. All who see you shall recognize you, for you will not make yourself bald for the dead and you do not eat all living creatures. If you are a holy people, then it is unfitting for you to eat that which is unclean and defiles one&#x2019;s soul.</p>
<p>3. ANY ABOMINABLE THING. Anything which is abominable to a pure soul such as anything that crawls on the ground.</p>
<p>4. THE OX, THE SHEEP. A <italic>vav</italic> should have been placed before the word <italic>seh</italic> (sheep).<sup><xref rid="fn748">4</xref></sup> The term <italic>seh</italic> applies to both sheep and goats.<sup><xref rid="fn749">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. THE HART, AND THE GAZELLE. We know the meaning [of <italic>ayyal</italic> (the hart) and <italic>tzevi</italic> (the gazelle)]. We need tradition<sup><xref rid="fn750">6</xref></sup> for the other five.<sup><xref rid="fn751">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. BUT CHEWETH NOT THE CUD. The word <italic>yiggar</italic> (will chew) is missing.<sup><xref rid="fn752">8</xref></sup> Our text employs abbreviated terminology.<sup><xref rid="fn753">9</xref></sup> On the other hand, the word <italic>lo</italic> (to it) might be missing.<sup><xref rid="fn754">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. FINS AND SCALES. This has been explained previously.<sup><xref rid="fn755">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. OF ALL CLEAN BIRDS YOU MAY EAT. <italic>Tzippor</italic> (birds) is a general term.<sup><xref rid="fn756">12</xref></sup> The dove and turtledove are subcategories of the general term &#x201C;birds.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn757">13</xref></sup> The <italic>dayyah</italic> (the kite)<sup><xref rid="fn758">14</xref></sup> and the <italic>ayyah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn759">15</xref></sup> (the falcon)<sup><xref rid="fn760">16</xref></sup> are subcategories of the <italic>da&#x2019;ah</italic> (falcon) (Lev. 11:14),<sup><xref rid="fn761">17</xref></sup> as Scripture now elaborates.<sup><xref rid="fn762">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. OF ALL CLEAN WINGED THINGS. Such as the lo-cust.<sup><xref rid="fn763">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. YE SHALL NOT EAT OF ANY THING THAT DIETH OF ITSELF. Of fowl or beast.<sup><xref rid="fn764">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU MAYEST GIVE IT UNTO THE STRANGER. Who, as I have explained, did not convert to the Jewish faith.<sup><xref rid="fn765">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR THOU MAYEST SELL IT UNTO A FOREIGNER. Who does not live in your country. The law stating <italic>Thou shalt not seethe a kid</italic><sup><xref rid="fn766">22</xref></sup> follows, for it<sup><xref rid="fn767">23</xref></sup> refers to meat.<sup><xref rid="fn768">24</xref></sup> I have already explained the latter.</p>
<p>22. THOU SHALT SURELY TITHE. This section<sup><xref rid="fn769">25</xref></sup> follows<sup><xref rid="fn770">26</xref></sup> because it is prohibited to eat any unclean winged creature and any unclean animal, nor any animal which died of natural causes.<sup><xref rid="fn771">27</xref></sup> Now it is similarly forbidden to eat sacred grain<sup><xref rid="fn772">28</xref></sup> or sacred meat in any but the chosen place.</p>
<p>WHICH IS BROUGHT FORTH IN THE FIELD YEAR BY YEAR. Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi the Spaniard, who rests in Eden, said <italic>that which is brought forth in the field</italic> is connected to the word <italic>seed</italic>, and our verse is to be understood as, you shall tithe the seed which is brought into the field for planting.<sup><xref rid="fn773">29</xref></sup> However, I believe that we are to interpret the verse according to its plain meaning. Our clause refers to the produce which the field brings forth.<sup><xref rid="fn774">30</xref></sup> Should some dispute this and argue that Scripture reads <italic>ha-yotze</italic> (which is brought forth), and <italic>yotze</italic> (brought forth) is an intransitive verb, then we will show him <italic>ha-ir ha-yotzet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn775">31</xref></sup> <italic>elef</italic> (the city that sent forth a thousand) (Amos 5:3). <italic>Shall have a hundred left</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn776">32</xref></sup> proves this.<sup><xref rid="fn777">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rabbis said that the reference is to the second tithe.<sup><xref rid="fn778">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note.<sup><xref rid="fn779">35</xref></sup> If you start from the top,<sup><xref rid="fn780">36</xref></sup> then one is the first number. If you start from below,<sup><xref rid="fn781">37</xref></sup> then, behold, ten is the first number.<sup><xref rid="fn782">38</xref></sup> This is the secret of the first-born and the tithe.<sup><xref rid="fn783">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observe. The number one does not depend on a sum.<sup><xref rid="fn784">40</xref></sup> The number ten is similar. It is the counterpart of one because it is the beginning of the second series of numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn785">41</xref></sup> It is also the end of the first series.<sup><xref rid="fn786">42</xref></sup> All parts of sums are connected to ten in front and in back.<sup><xref rid="fn787">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>The numbers one and ten are the main numbers; the middle numbers, five and six, are called the round numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn788">44</xref></sup> These four numbers<sup><xref rid="fn789">45</xref></sup> therefore<sup><xref rid="fn790">46</xref></sup> form the silent letters.<sup><xref rid="fn791">47</xref></sup> They are also the letters that form the glorious and awe-inspiring name.<sup><xref rid="fn792">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND THE FIRSTLINGS OF THY HERD. The one who is fit<sup><xref rid="fn793">49</xref></sup> to eat them shall eat them, as I have previously explained.</p>
<p>THAT THOU MAYEST LEARN.<sup><xref rid="fn794">50</xref></sup> This means that when you go to the revered place,<sup><xref rid="fn795">51</xref></sup> there they [<italic>kohanim</italic>] will teach you. There is a second meaning to <italic>le-ma&#x2019;an tilmad</italic> (that thou mayest learn). <italic>Tilmad</italic> is similar in meaning to <italic>melummadah</italic> (well broken), as in <italic>And Ephraim is a heifer well broken</italic> (Hos. 10:11). Its meaning is habituated.<sup><xref rid="fn796">52</xref></sup> This interpretation appears correct to me.</p>
<p>25. THEN SHALT THOU TURN IT INTO MONEY. The reference is to the tithe.<sup><xref rid="fn797">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THY HAND. It is placed in your hands.<sup><xref rid="fn798">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. OR FOR STRONG DRINK. Made from honey, dates, wheat, or barley.</p>
<p>OR FOR WHATEVER THY SOUL ASKETH OF THEE. Fruits.<sup><xref rid="fn799">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU AND THY HOUSEHOLD. You and your sons are obligated.<sup><xref rid="fn800">56</xref></sup> It is optional for your household, for the commandment mandating the three pilgrimages falls on males.<sup><xref rid="fn801">57</xref></sup> The woman who goes to the chosen place, as Elkanah&#x2019;s wives did,<sup><xref rid="fn802">58</xref></sup> is rewarded.</p>
<p>27. AND THE LEVITE THAT IS WITHIN THY GATES. The reference is to the house of Levi.<sup><xref rid="fn803">59</xref></sup> You will be rewarded if you do not forsake him. You shall give the Levite what you can afford.<sup><xref rid="fn804">60</xref></sup> The verse probably speaks of the first tithe.<sup><xref rid="fn805">61</xref></sup> Since Scripture mentioned the second tithe,<sup><xref rid="fn806">62</xref></sup> it now goes on to say, do not think that you have fulfilled your obligation<sup><xref rid="fn807">63</xref></sup> with the second tithe alone.<sup><xref rid="fn808">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT IS WITHIN THY GATES.] The meaning of <italic>that is within thy gates</italic> is that one should give it to the Levite that is within his gates. Her should not say,<sup><xref rid="fn809">65</xref></sup> I will keep it with me and give it to another Levite, or<sup><xref rid="fn810">66</xref></sup> that I have given it.<sup><xref rid="fn811">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AT THE END OF EVERY THREE YEARS. The reference is to the third tithe.<sup><xref rid="fn812">68</xref></sup> The Israelites do not have to give the second tithe this year. Some say that the Israelites had to give all thee tithes.<sup><xref rid="fn813">69</xref></sup> Those who deny the Rabbinic tradition<sup><xref rid="fn814">70</xref></sup> say that the first tithe<sup><xref rid="fn815">71</xref></sup> is the commandment referred to in the verse that begins, <italic>Thou shalt surely tithe</italic> (v. 1). They say that <italic>thou shalt turn it into money</italic> (v. 25) is directed to the Levite<sup><xref rid="fn816">72</xref></sup> and that similarly <italic>the firstlings&#x2026; of thy flock</italic> (v. 23) is directed to the <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn817">73</xref></sup> They say there is no such thing as the second tithe except for tithe given in the third year.<sup><xref rid="fn818">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>AT THE END.<sup><xref rid="fn819">75</xref></sup> At the beginning.<sup><xref rid="fn820">76</xref></sup> The tithe given in the third year is called the &#x201C;poor tithe.&#x201D; We will rely on the tradition of our fathers.<sup><xref rid="fn821">77</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn749"><sup>5</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>seh kevasim ve-seh izzim</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn751"><sup>7</sup> Mentioned in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn752"><sup>8</sup> Our text reads, <italic>ve-lo gerah. Gerah</italic> is a noun. Thus our text reads, and no cud. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn755"><sup>11</sup> See I.E. on Lev. 11:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn756"><sup>12</sup> It does not refer to a specific species of birds.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn758"><sup>14</sup> Mentioned in our verse but not in Leviticus&#x2019; enumeration of the prohibited birds. See Lev. 11:13-20.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn761"><sup>17</sup> Mentioned only in Leviticus. Thus there is no contradiction between the lists of the 20 prohibited birds in our chapter and the 21 of Leviticus. See <italic>The Secret of the Torah</italic>, pp. 36,37: &#x201C;We find that the number of prohibited fowl listed in the Torah portion <italic>Shemini</italic> is 20. However, in the Torah portion <italic>Re&#x2019;eh Anokhi</italic>, the number is 21. The answer is found in the science of logic, for <italic>da&#x2019;ah</italic> (Lev. 11:14) is a supreme kind that includes both the <italic>dayyah</italic> and the <italic>ra&#x2019;ah</italic> (Deut. 14:13).&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn773"><sup>29</sup> That is, the produce from the seed. Rabbi Yehuudah believes that <italic>yotze</italic> (is brought forth) is intransitive. Hence his interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn774"><sup>30</sup> In other words, that <italic>yotze</italic> (is brought forth) is transitive. Our verse is to be understood as follows: You shall tithe the seed which the field produces.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn775"><sup>31</sup> <italic>Ha-yotzet</italic> is the feminine form of <italic>ha-yotze</italic>. It is transitive. We thus see that <italic>ha-yotze</italic> can also be transitive.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn777"><sup>33</sup> That <italic>ha-yotzet</italic> is transitive, for it speaks about what is left in the city.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn781"><sup>37</sup> At the bottom of the first ten numbers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn782"><sup>38</sup> That is, the first of the tens.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn783"><sup>39</sup> This is the reason the first-born and the tithe are holy. The first-born corresponds to the number one, while the tithe corresponds to the number ten.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn784"><sup>40</sup> Every number is made up of sums. However, the number one stands by itself. It does not consist of any sum.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn785"><sup>41</sup> It is the first of the tens. Hence it is similar to one.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn786"><sup>42</sup> One through nine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn787"><sup>43</sup> &#x201C;Front&#x201D; means before ten. &#x201C;Back&#x201D; means after ten. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the main numbers, that is numbers 1-9 end in 10. Thus 1-9 are connected to ten in front. All numbers after 10 are either 10 plus one of the main numbers or multiples of ten plus one of the main numbers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn788"><sup>44</sup> If 5 and 6 are squared, cubed or raised to the nth power, their root is always visible. For example, 5 squared is 25, 5 cubed is 125; 6 squared is 36, 6 cubed is 216, and so on (Meijler). Thus 5 and 6 are called round numbers because in effect, they orbit their root or make a circle and ultimately return to their root.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 15</title>
<p>[1. AT THE END OF<sup><xref rid="fn822">1</xref></sup> EVERY SEVEN YEARS.] Its meaning, as I have explained, is, at the beginning of the year.<sup><xref rid="fn823">2</xref></sup> <italic>Assemble the people</italic> (Deut. 31:12) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn824">3</xref></sup> This section follows<sup><xref rid="fn825">4</xref></sup> because Scripture states that the poor tithe<sup><xref rid="fn826">5</xref></sup> belongs to the Levite, the stranger, the orphan, and the widow.<sup><xref rid="fn827">6</xref></sup> Scripture now says that the same applies to the remission of debts (<italic>shemittah</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn828">7</xref></sup> The word <italic>shemittah</italic> is similar to <italic>shimtuha</italic> (throw her down) (II Kings 98:33), the meaning of which is, release her and she will fall.<sup><xref rid="fn829">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. CREDITOR. The word <italic>masheh</italic> (loan) follows the paradigm of <italic>matteh</italic> (rod) (Ex. 4:4).<sup><xref rid="fn830">9</xref></sup> I believe that <italic>masheh</italic> is a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn831">10</xref></sup> However, many believe that <italic>masheh</italic> is a verb.<sup><xref rid="fn832">11</xref></sup> The word <italic>ba&#x2019;al</italic> (creditor) is similar to <italic>be&#x2019;aleha</italic> (him that hath it) in <italic>wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it</italic> (Eccles. 7:12) and <italic>be&#x2019;alav</italic> (the owners thereof) in <italic>It taketh away the life of the owners thereof</italic> (Prov. 1:19). It means the one who has the matter<sup><xref rid="fn833">12</xref></sup> in his power.</p>
<p>THAT WHICH HE HATH LENT. <italic>Yasheh</italic> (that which he hath lent) is a transitive verb. The one who borrows is called a <italic>nosheh bo</italic> (a borrower) (Is. 24:2).<sup><xref rid="fn834">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE SHALL NOT EXACT IT. The word <italic>yiggos</italic> (exact) means to press. Compare, <italic>tingosu</italic> (exact) in <italic>and exact all your labors</italic> (Is. 58:3). Look, the <italic>nun</italic> is visible in the imperfect in a word whose stem begins with a <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn835">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE LORD&#x2019;S RELEASE.<sup><xref rid="fn836">15</xref></sup> In honor of God,<sup><xref rid="fn837">16</xref></sup> who has bestowed wealth upon him. The name of God is connected to the word release because the year of release is called a Sabbath unto the Lord (Lev. 25:2,4).<sup><xref rid="fn838">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. OF A FOREIGNER THOU MAYEST EXACT IT. It is optional.</p>
<p>4. HOWBEIT. This means that you shall take note that that which I commanded you, not to exact interest from your brother, will be unnecessary if all of Israel or most of them will listen to God&#x2019;s voice. In this case, there will be no poor among you who need you to lend to them. On the contrary, all of you shall lend to many nations (v. 6). The meaning of <italic>ve-ha&#x2019;avateta</italic> (and thou shalt lend) (v. 6) is, you shall take his pledge (<italic>avot</italic>), that is, his pawn, for the money that you shall give him, which he needs to do business.</p>
<p>6. AND THOU SHALT RULE. Furthermore, being upright you will rule over nations. However, there is a commandment stating <italic>If there be among you a needy man</italic> (v. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn839">18</xref></sup> Moses knew that a generation will arise that will not be mostly meritorious. He therefore said, <italic>For the poor shall never cease out of the land</italic> (v. 11).</p>
<p>7. THOU SHALT NOT HARDEN THY HEART. By refraining from addressing comforting words to him.</p>
<p>SHUT. <italic>Tikpotz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn840">19</xref></sup> means you shall <italic>shut</italic>. Compare, <italic>kafetzah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn841">20</xref></sup> (stoppeth) in <italic>kafetzah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn842">21</xref></sup> <italic>piha</italic> (stoppeth her mouth) (Ps. 107:42; Job 5:16); <italic>kafatz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn843">22</xref></sup> <italic>be-af</italic> (shut up His compassion) (Ps. 77:10); and <italic>yikpetzu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn844">23</xref></sup> (shall shut) in <italic>Kings shall shut their mouths</italic> (Is. 52:15). <italic>Tikpotz</italic> is a verb in the <italic>kal</italic>.</p>
<p>NEEDY. Some say that the word <italic>evyon</italic> (needy) is related to the word <italic>avah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn845">24</xref></sup> (would) in <italic>and he would not</italic> (Ex. 10:27), for <italic>evyon</italic> follows the paradigm <italic>elyon, chevy on</italic>, and <italic>hegyon</italic>, the roots of which are <italic>ayin, lamed, heh; chet, bet, heh; heh, gimel, heh</italic>. An <italic>evyon</italic> is so called because he desires everything because of his need.</p>
<p>8. BUT THOU SHALT SURELY OPEN THY HAND. <italic>Pato&#x2019;ach</italic> (open) is an infinitive. Whenever Scripture omits the infinitive,<sup><xref rid="fn846">25</xref></sup> it is employing an abridged style. The midrashic interpretation is also beautiful.<sup><xref rid="fn847">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>OPEN THY HAND TO HIM. To the one who has nothing.</p>
<p>AND SHALT SURELY LEND HIM. The meaning of <italic>veha&#x2019;avet tavitennu</italic> (and shalt surely lend him) is, give him from yours by taking his pledge.<sup><xref rid="fn848">27</xref></sup> <italic>Tavitennu</italic> means take his pledge.</p>
<p>9. BASE. The word <italic>beliya&#x2019;al</italic> (base) is a noun. Some say that <italic>beliya&#x2019;al</italic> is a compound. It refers to a prayer that the vile person should not ascend, should not grow, and should not live.<sup><xref rid="fn849">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THINE EYE BE EVIL. <italic>Ve-ra&#x2019;ah</italic> (and thine eye be evil) is similar to <italic>ve-shavah</italic> (and is returned) in <italic>and is returned unto her father&#x2019;s house</italic> (Lev. 22:13). The word comes from a root two of whose letters are pronounced.<sup><xref rid="fn850">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. THAT. <italic>Bi-gelal</italic> (that) means the same as <italic>sibbah</italic> (because of). Compare, <italic>sabbev</italic> (cause) in <italic>cause to change</italic> (II Sam. 14:20).<sup><xref rid="fn851">30</xref></sup> For the All<sup><xref rid="fn852">31</xref></sup> is in the parts,<sup><xref rid="fn853">32</xref></sup> that is, in the parts of the All, that is, the body.<sup><xref rid="fn854">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU SHALT SURELY GIVE HIM. It means that if you give him, then God will add to your wealth.</p>
<p>11. FOR THE POOR SHALL NEVER CEASE OUT OF THE LAND. As I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn855">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNTO THY&#x2026;BROTHER. First, the one who is close to you.<sup><xref rid="fn856">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNTO THY POOR. The poor of your family. The needy of your land come before the needy of another place.</p>
<p><italic>If thy brother, a Hebrew man</italic> (v. 12) follows<sup><xref rid="fn857">36</xref></sup> because of <italic>thou shalt furnish him liberally</italic> (v. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn858">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THY BROTHER A HEBREW. I have explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn859">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR A HEBREW WOMAN. The reference is to <italic>And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant</italic> (Ex. 21:7).<sup><xref rid="fn860">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. EMPTY. I have explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn861">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. THOU SHALT FURNISH HIM LIBERALLY. <italic>Ha&#x2019;anek ta&#x2019;anik</italic> (thou shalt furnish him liberally) means treat him gloriously. <italic>Ta&#x2019;anik</italic> (thou shalt furnish him) is related to the word <italic>anakim</italic> (chains)<sup><xref rid="fn862">41</xref></sup> in <italic>And chains about thy neck</italic> (Prov. 1:9).<sup><xref rid="fn863">42</xref></sup> On the other hand, the meaning of <italic>ta&#x2019;anik</italic> is to be derived from its context.<sup><xref rid="fn864">43</xref></sup> In this case, the word has no brother.<sup><xref rid="fn865">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THROUGH HIS EAR AND INTO THE DOOR. I have explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn866">45</xref></sup> Scripture mentions this<sup><xref rid="fn867">46</xref></sup> because it states<sup><xref rid="fn868">47</xref></sup> that you are obligated to furnish him liberally when he goes free. However, if the slave does not want to go free, then you shall pierce his ear through with an awl.</p>
<p>AND ALSO UNTO THY BONDWOMAN THOU SHALT DO LIKEWISE. This is connected to<sup><xref rid="fn869">48</xref></sup> <italic>thou shalt furnish him liberally</italic> (v. 14), even though it is some distance from it, for a woman does not have her ear pierced. Compare, <italic>He shall make restitution; if he have nothing</italic><sup><xref rid="fn870">49</xref></sup> (Ex. 22:2);<sup><xref rid="fn871">50</xref></sup> <italic>And if he do not these three unto her</italic> (Ex. 21:11),<sup><xref rid="fn872">51</xref></sup> and many other instances.</p>
<p>18. IT SHALL NOT SEEM HARD UNTO THEE. We find it written in Scripture, <italic>three years, as the years of a hireling</italic> (Is. 16:14). The latter proves that a person has no right to hire himself out for more than three years. The law similarly applies to the one who hires him and pays his. wages.<sup><xref rid="fn873">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>[DOUBLE.]<sup><xref rid="fn874">53</xref></sup> The following is the definition of <italic>mishneh</italic>. It means double. Similarly <italic>mishneh</italic> (twice) <italic>in ve-hayah mishneh</italic> (and it shall be twice as much) (Ex. 16:5). The word <italic>mishneh</italic> in the latter is a noun. However, <italic>mishneh</italic> (next) in <italic>mishneh la-melekh</italic> (next unto king) (Esth. 10:3) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn875">54</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn876">55</xref></sup> is also related, as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn877">56</xref></sup> to the word <italic>shenayin</italic> (two).<sup><xref rid="fn878">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note, our verse explains that <italic>and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing</italic> (Ex. 21:2) refers to the beginning of the year.<sup><xref rid="fn879">58</xref></sup> There is also proof of this from the year of release (<italic>shemitttah</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn880">59</xref></sup> as well as from the Sabbath day.<sup><xref rid="fn881">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND&#x2026;WILL BLESS THEE. <italic>U-verakhekha</italic> (and will bless you) is an imperfect, not a perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn882">61</xref></sup> There is no difference between the perfect and imperfect.<sup><xref rid="fn883">62</xref></sup> The tense can only be determined by the context.</p>
<p>19. ALL THE FIRSTLINGS. This is mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn884">63</xref></sup> because of <italic>thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thine ox</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn885">64</xref></sup></p>

<p>21. ANY ILL BLEMISH. That are mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn888">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. WITHIN THY GATES. Some say that this means that the <italic>kohen</italic> shall eat it outside of the sanctuary.<sup><xref rid="fn889">68</xref></sup> Others say, since the animal has a blemish it belongs to the Israelite. However, this appears far-fetched to me.</p>
<p>THE UNCLEAN AND THE CLEAN. The reference is to <italic>may eat it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn890">69</xref></sup> Our verse is to be understood as a call: you, the clean and the unclean. Its meaning is, one is permitted to eat it whether one is clean or unclean. Scripture states this because one who is unclean and eats holy meat is punished with <italic>karet</italic> (excision).</p>
<p>Scripture reads <italic>three times in a year</italic> (Deut. 16:16) because it here (v. 20) states year by year.<sup><xref rid="fn891">70</xref></sup> Additionally,<sup><xref rid="fn892">71</xref></sup> because the firstling is to be eaten in the sanctuary.<sup><xref rid="fn893">72</xref></sup> The paschal offering<sup><xref rid="fn894">73</xref></sup> is similarly to be eaten in the sanctuary, not outside it.</p>

<ftnote id="fn853"><sup>32</sup> In human beings, who are part of the whole.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn854"><sup>33</sup> Thus by being kind to his fellow human being, a person is being kind to God (Weiser). Other commentaries explain that the All refers to the community of Israel and the parts to each individual Jew. Now, since all of Israel forms one body, by helping another Jew one is helping oneself (Motot and Rabbi Yosef ben Eliezer tov Elem, followed by Krinsky, Netter, and others). See Book III of the Kuzari: &#x201C;Plato calls&#x2026;that which is expended on behalf of the law the portion of the whole. If, however, an individual neglects &#x2018;the portion of the whole&#x2019;&#x2026;of which he forms a part, he sins against the commonwealth and more against himself; for the relation of the individual to the commonwealth is as the relation of the single limb to the body&#x2026;&#x201D; (Isaak Heinemann translation in <italic>Three Jewish Philosophers</italic>, N.Y., 1969, p. 99). In other words, the All is the nation, and the individual is a part of the nation. However, it should be noted that I.E. refers to God as the All. See I.E. on Gen. 1:26 (Vol. 1, p. 46), &#x201C;God is one&#x2026;He is all.&#x201D; Also see I.E. on Gen. 18:21 (Vol. 1, p. 196) and Ex. 33:21 (Vol. 2, p. 695). The above-noted commentaries may have shied away from interpreting God as All here because of its pantheistic implications. It should be noted that when I.E. says that God is All, he does not intend to identify God with the world as the pantheists do. He means that God&#x2019;s power and supervision hold the world together and give it continuous existence. Indeed, I.E. compares God&#x2019;s relation to the world to that of speech to the speaker. As long as the speaker speaks, sounds are uttered. However, the speaker is not identified with the speech which he utters. On the other hand, I.E. was a contemporary of Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi and may be employing terminology similar to the one quoted above.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 16</title>
<p>1. THE MONTH OF ABIV. It is called the month of Aviv because when the Israelites went out of the land of Egypt, the first of the barley crop (<italic>aviv</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn895">1</xref></sup> appeared in the fields in that month. Those who deny the Rabbinic tradition say that Passover<sup><xref rid="fn896">2</xref></sup> is not to be observed if the first of the barley crop has not appeared.<sup><xref rid="fn897">3</xref></sup> I have previously responded to their nonsense.<sup><xref rid="fn898">4</xref></sup> We will also admit that the Beth Din<sup><xref rid="fn899">5</xref></sup> took the appearance of the first barley crop into consideration.<sup><xref rid="fn900">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that in Hebrew the months have no names.<sup><xref rid="fn901">7</xref></sup> Nisan (Esth. 3:7; Neh. 2:1), Sivan (Esth. 8:9), and also Kislev (Neh. 1:1), Tevet (Esth. 2:16), and Adar (Esth. 3:7), which are mentioned in Scripture, are Chaldean terms. Hence Scripture states, <italic>which is the month of Nisan</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn902">8</xref></sup> However, we find Ziv (I Kings 6:37),<sup><xref rid="fn903">9</xref></sup> Etanim (I Kings 8:2),<sup><xref rid="fn904">10</xref></sup> and Bul (I Kings 6:38).<sup><xref rid="fn905">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of first<sup><xref rid="fn906">12</xref></sup> is that when you find the first barley ripe, then the first month has arrived, for one starts counting the months from it We do not care about this,<sup><xref rid="fn907">13</xref></sup> whether the year that passed consisted of twelve months or thirteen months.<sup><xref rid="fn908">14</xref></sup> This is the meaning of first.<sup><xref rid="fn909">15</xref></sup> However, the ancients of blessed memory transmitted traditions regarding many other things along with the ripe barley grain.<sup><xref rid="fn910">16</xref></sup> All of their words are true.</p>
<p>BY NIGHT.<sup><xref rid="fn911">17</xref></sup> He took you from the authority of Pharaoh. They left Egypt close to night.<sup><xref rid="fn912">18</xref></sup> I will explain it later.<sup><xref rid="fn913">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. OF THE FLOCK. To fulfill the obligation of the paschal sacrifice.</p>
<p>AND THE HERD. For peace offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn914">20</xref></sup> The fact that Scripture says, <italic>and three thousand bullocks</italic> (II Chron. 35:7), after it says, <italic>all of them for the passover-offerings</italic>, with regard to the lambs and kids (<italic>Ibid.</italic>), is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn915">21</xref></sup> It similarly tells us that they gave (unto the Levite) <italic>for the passover-offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>, v. 9). Scripture thus mentions the Passover offerings before it mentions the cattle.<sup><xref rid="fn916">22</xref></sup> It similarly states, <italic>thou and thy household</italic> (Deut. 14:26).<sup><xref rid="fn917">23</xref></sup> Some say that Scripture commanded that a lamb or a he-goat were to be offered in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn918">24</xref></sup> However, Scripture now tells us if one is able to, he may offer cattle. However, the first interpretation is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn919">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. THOU SHALT EAT NO LEAVENED BREAD. No leaven shall be present when the paschal offering is slaughtered.</p>
<p>BREAD OF AFFLICTION. For a memorial.</p>
<p>ALL THE DAYS OF THY LIFE. Every year.</p>
<p>4. WHICH THOU SACRIFICEST&#x2026;AT EVEN. The reference is to the flesh of the Passover offering.</p>
<p>6. AT EVEN, AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN. I have explained this previously.<sup><xref rid="fn920">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>AT THE SEASON THAT THOU CAMEST FORTH OUT OF EGYPT. The reference is to the Passover offering, as the Israelites left Egypt in the month of Aviv. It<sup><xref rid="fn921">27</xref></sup> is not connected to <italic>at the going down of the sun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn922">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND THOU SHALT ROAST.<sup><xref rid="fn923">29</xref></sup> I have previously explained that <italic>u-vishalta</italic> means you shall roast in fire.<sup><xref rid="fn924">30</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And they roasted</italic> (va-yevashelu)<sup><xref rid="fn925">31</xref></sup> <italic>the passover with fire</italic> (II Chron. 35:13). Scripture reads <italic>u-vishalta</italic> to indicate that the Passover offering is not to be eaten raw.<sup><xref rid="fn926">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THOU SHALT TURN IN THE MORNING. Those who deny the Rabbinic tradition<sup><xref rid="fn927">33</xref></sup> say that the verse tells the Israelite to go to his house and land on the holy day.<sup><xref rid="fn928">34</xref></sup> We will not rely on our own minds when it comes to the commandments. We will rely only on those who transmitted the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn929">35</xref></sup> Look, we find Scripture stating, <italic>On the eighth day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn930">36</xref></sup> <italic>he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn931">37</xref></sup> <italic>sent the people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn932">38</xref></sup> <italic>away</italic> (I Kings 8:66). The latter was a holy day.<sup><xref rid="fn933">39</xref></sup> Another verse says, <italic>And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month</italic><sup><xref rid="fn934">40</xref></sup> <italic>he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn935">41</xref></sup> <italic>sent the people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn936">42</xref></sup> <italic>away unto their tents</italic> (II Chron. 7:1). Some say that the meaning of <italic>unto their tents</italic> is, to their tents, which were close by.<sup><xref rid="fn937">43</xref></sup> They went to their lands<sup><xref rid="fn938">44</xref></sup> on the weekday.</p>
<p>AND GO UNTO THY TENTS. Around Jerusalem. The Israelite would then go to his land on the weekday.</p>
<p>8. SIX DAYS. The ancients said six days from the lifting of the sickle.<sup><xref rid="fn939">45</xref></sup> It is possible that <italic>and on the seventh day</italic> is connected to <italic>six days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn940">46</xref></sup> <italic>And on the seventh day</italic> was separated from the first half of the verse and placed in the second half of the verse because Scripture wanted to warn against doing work.<sup><xref rid="fn941">47</xref></sup> Scripture does not say all manner of work.<sup><xref rid="fn942">48</xref></sup> The reason for the latter is that only servile work<sup><xref rid="fn943">49</xref></sup> is prohibited. Where Scripture does state all manner of work,<sup><xref rid="fn944">50</xref></sup> it reads, &#x201C;Save&#x201D; [that which every man must eat].<sup><xref rid="fn945">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Scripture mentions that one is obligated to offer the Passover sacrifice in the glorious place, it also mentions the second festival (v. 9)<sup><xref rid="fn946">52</xref></sup> and the third festival (v. 13).<sup><xref rid="fn947">53</xref></sup> It does not mention the day of <italic>shofar</italic> sounding<sup><xref rid="fn948">54</xref></sup> and the tenth day,<sup><xref rid="fn949">55</xref></sup> because the congregation does not gather then in the sanctuary.<sup><xref rid="fn950">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AFTER THE MEASURE. The <italic>samekh</italic> of <italic>missat</italic> (after the measure) receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> to compensate for the missing <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn951">57</xref></sup> <italic>Missat</italic> is related to the word <italic>nes</italic> (banner). It means the lifting of the hand.<sup><xref rid="fn952">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE FREEWILL-OFFERING OF THY HAND. For burnt offerings and peace offerings.</p>
<p>12. AND THOU SHALT REMEMBER THAT THOU WAST A BONDMAN. This is connected to <italic>thy man-servant and thy maid-servant</italic> (v. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn953">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AFTER THAT THOU HAST GATHERED IN FROM THY THRESHING-FLOOR AND FROM THY WINEPRESS. Hence this festival is called <italic>the feast of ingathering</italic> (Ex. 34:22).<sup><xref rid="fn954">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. SHALT THOU KEEP A FEAST. <italic>Tachog</italic> (shalt thou keep a feast) means you shall sacrifice the offering.<sup><xref rid="fn955">61</xref></sup> The reference is to the congregation.<sup><xref rid="fn956">62</xref></sup> On the other hand, it might refer to the individual. The Israelite is told to make burnt and peace offerings. <italic>Shall bless thee</italic> is proof of this. It means do this<sup><xref rid="fn957">63</xref></sup> because God blessed you. Scripture adds <italic>all thine increase</italic> to explain that the object of <italic>bless thee</italic> is the produce which the earth will bring forth.</p>
<p>THE WORK OF THY HANDS. Trade and goods produced by craftsmen.</p>
<p>AND THOU SHALT BE ALTOGETHER JOYFUL. There is a commandment to be joyful on the festival of Sukkot.<sup><xref rid="fn958">64</xref></sup> Others say that it means that God will bless you in the future and you will always be happy.<sup><xref rid="fn959">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>[ALTOGETHER.] The meaning of altogether is, you shall always be happy.</p>
<p>16. AND THEY SHALL NOT APPEAR&#x2026;EMPTY. This is what Scripture means by <italic>after the measure of the freewill-offering of thy hand</italic> (v. 10).</p>
<p>BEFORE THE LORD. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn960">66</xref></sup></p>

<p>18. [JUDGES.] Even though each and every commandment stands by itself there is, as it were, a midrashic reason for the connection of the sections.<sup><xref rid="fn961">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning <italic>of Judges&#x2026;</italic>is, even though you are obligated to go three times a year to the place of the <italic>kohanim</italic> who serve in the sanctuary and there inquire regarding the statues and laws, it will not suffice. You must have judges in all of your cities.<sup><xref rid="fn962">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>OFFICERS. <italic>Shoterim</italic> (officers) means rulers. It is related to <italic>shoter</italic> (ruler) in <italic>Overseer, or ruler</italic> (Prov. 6:6) and similarly <italic>mishtaro</italic> (dominion thereof) in <italic>the dominion thereof in the earth</italic> (Job 38:33).</p>
<p>The <italic>shofetim</italic> (judges) judge and the <italic>shoterim</italic> (officers) force the crooked [to obey the law].</p>
<p>IN ALL THY GATES. We find that Jehoshaphat<sup><xref rid="fn963">69</xref></sup> acted in this manner.<sup><xref rid="fn964">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>TRIBE BY TRIBE. In all the gates of each and every tribe.</p>
<p>AND THEY SHALL JUDGE. The reference is to the judges.</p>
<p>19. THOU SHALT NOT WREST JUDGMENT. Scripture speaks to each one of the judges.</p>
<p>THOU SHALT NOT RESPECT PERSONS. I have explained the word <italic>takkir</italic> (thou shalt respect) in my comments on <italic>Ye shall not respect</italic> (takkiru) <italic>persons in judgment</italic> (Deut. 1:17).</p>
<p>20. JUSTICE, JUSTICE. Moses speaks to the disputants. Moses repeats the word justice to indicate that one should pursue justice whether one gains or loses. Or the word is repeated to indicate that one should pursue justice as long as one exists;<sup><xref rid="fn965">71</xref></sup> or the word is repeated for emphasis.</p>
<p>THAT THOU MAYEST LIVE. Moses speaks to those who are entering the land.</p>
<p>AND INHERIT THE LAND. Moses speaks to their children. It means, you<sup><xref rid="fn966">72</xref></sup> will keep this inheritance.<sup><xref rid="fn967">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first thing that the judge has to be concerned with is widespread pagan practices such as the one referred to in <italic>Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah</italic> (v. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn968">74</xref></sup> The Torah states the latter, for such is the practice of pagan worship, as <italic>Behind one in the midst</italic> (Is. 66:17)<sup><xref rid="fn969">75</xref></sup> shows.</p>
<p>22. NEITHER SHALT THOU SET THEE UP A PILLAR. For an idol, as <italic>which the Lord thy God hateth</italic> proves.<sup><xref rid="fn970">76</xref></sup> However, a pillar which is not set up for idol worship is permitted. The most convincing proof of this is found in the portion which opens with the words <italic>And Jacob sent</italic> (Gen. 32:4).<sup><xref rid="fn971">77</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn895"><sup>1</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 13:4 (Vol. 2, p. 259). I.E. there renders <italic>aviv</italic> as the first of the barley crop. Thus according to I.E. <italic>the month of Abiv</italic> means the month when the first of the barley crop appears in the field.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn896"><sup>2</sup> The offering of the paschal lamb (Meijler).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn897"><sup>3</sup> If the <italic>aviv</italic> did not appear, then the paschal lamb was not offered that year. They do not believe that an additional month was added to the year if the <italic>aviv</italic> had not yet arrived. (See Meijler).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn898"><sup>4</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 12:2 (Vol. 2, p. 203).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn899"><sup>5</sup> The law court which determined the onset of the new month.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn900"><sup>6</sup> When deciding whether to add an additional month to the year. However, they also took other things into consideration. See Talmud <italic>San</italic>. 11a,b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn901"><sup>7</sup> Hence adding a thirteenth month presented no problems.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn902"><sup>8</sup> Esth. 3:7 reads, <italic>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan</italic>. Scripture identifies the first month by its Chaldean name because the Jews did not call the month by that name in earlier times.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn903"><sup>9</sup> For the second month.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn904"><sup>10</sup> For the seventh month.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn905"><sup>11</sup> For the eighth month. In other words, only the second, seventh, and eighth months had appellations. The other months were known only by number.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn906"><sup>12</sup> Why Scripture calls Nisan the first month. See Ex: 12:2, <italic>It shall be the first month of the year to you</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn907"><sup>13</sup> The declaration of the first month.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn908"><sup>14</sup> The arrival of Aviv determines the arrival of the first month. The number of months of the previous year is irrelevant. If the year had a set number of months their exhaustion would determine the year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn909"><sup>15</sup> The point is, we start to count the months when the <italic>aviv</italic> arrives.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn910"><sup>16</sup> According to the Talmud the year may also be intercalated and the coming month not declared the first month because the fruit has not yet ripened and because the season of spring has not yet arrived. See <italic>San</italic>. 11:a,b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn911"><sup>17</sup> The night of the fifteenth. I.E. comments thus because according to Ex. 13:4, Israel left Egypt by day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn912"><sup>18</sup> They actually left in the early morning, when it was still dark. Hence Scripture refers to it as night (Weiser). See I.E. on Ex. 12:31 (Vol. 2, p. 245).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn913"><sup>19</sup> He didn&#x2019;t in this commentary. However, he did in the Long Commentary. See Vol. 2, p. 245.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn914"><sup>20</sup> The paschal sacrifice could only be brought from the flock. See Ex. 12:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn915"><sup>21</sup> That <italic>And the herd</italic> refers to peace offerings, for Scripture implies that only the lambs and kids were offered as paschal sacrifices. II Chron. 35:7 states: <italic>And Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all of them for the passover-offerings, unto all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn916"><sup>22</sup> Which shows that the oxen were not for the Passover offerings, for if they were they would have been so mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn917"><sup>23</sup> The meaning of which is, you are obligated to eat the tithe in the place of the sanctuary. Your household may do so if they want to. However, they are not obligated to do so. We thus see that Scripture juxtaposes two things that are similar but not identical in one verse. The same is true of <italic>the flock and the herd</italic>. The former applies to the paschal offering and the latter to peace offerings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn918"><sup>24</sup> In Ex. 12:5, I.E. quotes this in the name of Rabbi Moses ben Amram Ha-Parsi. The later was a Karaite Bible commentator. See Vol. 2, p. 220.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn919"><sup>25</sup> The first interpretation is that of the rabbis.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn920"><sup>26</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 12:6 (Vol. 2, pp. 221-225).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn921"><sup>27</sup> <italic>At the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn922"><sup>28</sup> <italic>At the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt</italic> refers to <italic>thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering</italic>, not to <italic>at the going down of the sun</italic>, which precedes <italic>At the season</italic>, etc., for the Israelites did not leave Egypt at the going down of the sun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn923"><sup>29</sup> Hebrew, <italic>u-vishalta</italic> [literally, and you shall cook].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn924"><sup>30</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 12:9 (Vol. 2, pp. 228-231). Ex. 12:9 states, <italic>Eat not of it&#x2026;sodden at all with water, but roast with fire</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn925"><sup>31</sup> Here too the word means roasted, not cooked.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn926"><sup>32</sup> The word <italic>bashel</italic> (cooked) comes from the same root as the word ripe. Thus <italic>u-vishalta</italic> can be taken to mean prepare (cook or roast) it to the point where it is fit to be eaten.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn927"><sup>33</sup> The Karaites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn928"><sup>34</sup> On the first day of Passover, for that is the day following the night that the Passover offering is eaten.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn929"><sup>35</sup> According to the rabbis, <italic>and thou shalt turn in the morning</italic> refers to the morning of the sixteenth of Nissan. See <italic>Hagigah</italic> 17a,b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn930"><sup>36</sup> Of Sukkot, i.e., Shemini Atzeret.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn931"><sup>37</sup> King Solomon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn932"><sup>38</sup> Who came to celebrate the dedication of the Holy Temple.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn933"><sup>39</sup> For it was Shemini Atzeret.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn934"><sup>40</sup> That is, on Shemini Atzeret.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn935"><sup>41</sup> King Solomon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn936"><sup>42</sup> Who came to celebrate the dedication of the Holy Temple.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn937"><sup>43</sup> Around Jerusalem. Thus going to their tents did not entail a violation of the festival. The same is true in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn938"><sup>44</sup> To their place of residence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn939"><sup>45</sup> On the new crop. The reference is to the cutting of the <italic>&#x201C;omer.&#x201D;</italic> This took place on the second day of Passover. See Lev. 23:9-12. Scripture prohibits eating of the new crop of grain before a measure (an omer) of new grain is cut and offered on the altar. Now, the Torah commands that matzot be eaten for seven days (v. 3). This contradicts our verse which states that matzot be eaten for six days. The Talmud (<italic>Menachot</italic> 66a) explains that our verse refers to matzot baked from the new crop, which could not be eaten before the second day of Passover, while the verse that tells the Israelites to eat matzot for seven days speaks of matzot made from grain from the previous year. See Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn940"><sup>46</sup> In other words, our text should read, Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and [so too] on the seventh day. In other words, you shall eat unleavened bread for seven days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn941"><sup>47</sup> On the seventh day. The point is <italic>and on the seventh day</italic> refers to both the first part of the verse and to the second. Our verse is to be understood as follows: <italic>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread;</italic> and [so too] on the seventh day; <italic>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly &#x2026;thou shalt do no work therein</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn942"><sup>48</sup> All manner of work is prohibited on the Sabbath and Yom Kippur. However, work necessary for the preparation of food is permitted on festivals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn943"><sup>49</sup> All work except that which is necessary for the preparation of food. See Ex. 12:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn944"><sup>50</sup> With regard to a festival.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn945"><sup>51</sup> See Ex. 12:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn946"><sup>52</sup> The second pilgrimage festival, i.e., Shavu&#x2019;ot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn947"><sup>53</sup> The third pilgrimage festival, i.e., Sukkot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn948"><sup>54</sup> Rosh Ha-Shanah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn949"><sup>55</sup> The tenth day of Tishri, i.e., Yom Kippur.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn950"><sup>56</sup> On these days. There is no commandment to make a pilgrimage to the sanctuary on Rosh Ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn951"><sup>57</sup> <italic>Missat comes</italic> from <italic>the root nun, samekh, samekh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn952"><sup>58</sup> Thus <italic>missat nidvat yadekha</italic> (after the measure of the freewill-offering of thy hand) means the lifting of the freewill-offering of thy hand. Scripture uses the term lifting when it deals with an offering to the sanctuary. Compare the word <italic>trumah</italic> (offering), which literally means a lifting.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn953"><sup>59</sup> You shall be kind to your servants, for you were a slave in the land of Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn954"><sup>60</sup> The festival of Sukkot is also referred to as the festival of ingathering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn955"><sup>61</sup> According to I.E. the word <italic>chag</italic> not only means a holiday, it also refers to the sacrifice that is offered on the festival. See I.E. on Ex. 5:1 (Vol. 2, p. 115).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn956"><sup>62</sup> The injunction, you shall sacrifice the offering, is directed to the congregation, for the congregation is obligated to bring the special offerings on the festivals (the <italic>musaf</italic> offerings).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn957"><sup>63</sup> Sacrifice burnt and peace offerings</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn958"><sup>64</sup> In other words, <italic>and thou shalt be&#x2026;joyful</italic> refers to the festival of Sukkot</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn959"><sup>65</sup> In other words, <italic>and thou shalt be&#x2026;joyful</italic> refers not only to the festival of Sukkot, it refers to the whole year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn960"><sup>66</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 23:15 (Vol. 2, p. 501). I.E. there explains that <italic>et pene Adonai</italic> means before the Lord. <italic>Et pene Adonai</italic> literally means the face of God. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn961"><sup>67</sup> The commandments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn962"><sup>68</sup> Literally, your gates. Hence the law of judges follows the law of the three pilgrimage festivals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn963"><sup>69</sup> A king of Judah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn964"><sup>70</sup> See II Chron. 19:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn965"><sup>71</sup> The repetition of the word connotes continuity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn966"><sup>72</sup> The children of those who inherit the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn967"><sup>73</sup> The Land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn968"><sup>74</sup> Hence this law follows the one of appointing judges.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn969"><sup>75</sup> I.E. in Isaiah renders this as, Behind one <italic>asherah</italic> in the midst of the garden. See I.E. on Is. 66:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn970"><sup>76</sup> God hates a pillar set up to an idol.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn971"><sup>77</sup> There, Scripture (Gen. 35:14) relates that Jacob set up a pillar to God. Also see I.E. on Gen. 28:17, (Vol. 1, p. 279), where he writes that Scripture does not prohibit a pillar to honor God.</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 17</title>
<p>1. THOU SHALT NOT SACRIFICE UNTO THE LORD THY GOD. Look, when Moses mentions the <italic>asherah</italic> and the pillar he also mentions that it is prohibited to slaughter any blemished animal to God.<sup><xref rid="fn972">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVEN ANY EVIL THING. <italic>Any evil thing</italic> explains any blemish.</p>
<p>FOR THAT IS AN ABOMINATION. Its meaning is similar to <italic>Present it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn973">2</xref></sup> <italic>now unto thy governor</italic><sup><xref rid="fn974">3</xref></sup> (Mal. 12:8). The one who offers it is punished. However, no punishment befalls one who does not sacrifice at all, unless he is obligated to bring an offering.<sup><xref rid="fn975">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. IF THERE BE FOUND IN THE MIDST OF THEE. After Moses mentions that one is prohibited to plant an <italic>asherah</italic> near an altar which is in public view, he backtracks and warns the individual not to worship idols.<sup><xref rid="fn976">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN TRANSGRESSING HIS COVENANT. <italic>La&#x2019;avor brito</italic> (in transgressing His covenant) is the reverse of keeping His covenant.</p>
<p>I have previously explained grammatically the word <italic>vayishtachu</italic> (and worshipped), in the <italic>Sefer Ha-Yesod</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn977">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. OTHER GODS. Idols, the work of man.</p>
<p>OR THE SUN, OR THE MOON, OR ANY OF THE HOST OF HEAVEN. Which are the work of God.</p>
<p>WHICH I HAVE COMMANDED NOT. To serve them, even though they are My works.</p>
<p>THEN THOU SHALT INQUIRE DILIGENTLY. <italic>Hetev</italic> (diligently) means very much. Similarly <italic>hetev</italic> (greatly) in <italic>Art thou greatly angry</italic> (Jonah 4:9). It is a bit far-fetched to connect <italic>hetev</italic> to the word <italic>tov</italic> (good).<sup><xref rid="fn978">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THOU SHALT STONE THEM. The man or the woman.<sup><xref rid="fn979">8</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>they shall be burnt with fire</italic>, <italic>both he and they</italic> (Lev. 20:14).<sup><xref rid="fn980">9</xref></sup> Since Scripture says, <italic>and it be told thee</italic> (v. 4) in secret,<sup><xref rid="fn981">10</xref></sup> and <italic>thou hear it</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>) in public,<sup><xref rid="fn982">11</xref></sup> it had to explain that even though it was told to you, and you heard, they shall not be put to death except upon the testimony of two witnesses.<sup><xref rid="fn983">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. OR THREE WITNESSES. Who accept the testimony of two witnesses.<sup><xref rid="fn984">13</xref></sup> So says the Gaon.<sup><xref rid="fn985">14</xref></sup> Look, the Torah does not state whether we accept the testimony of relatives or of a woman or the testimony of an enemy of the deceased.<sup><xref rid="fn986">15</xref></sup> Some say that if two witnesses contradict two witnesses, then a third witnesses determines innocence or guilt.<sup><xref rid="fn987">16</xref></sup> Others say two witnesses from among the wise men and three from the others.<sup><xref rid="fn988">17</xref></sup> We are thus forced to rely on the words of tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn989">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THE HAND<sup><xref rid="fn990">19</xref></sup> OF THE WITNESSES.<sup><xref rid="fn991">20</xref></sup> The hand of each one of the witnesses.<sup><xref rid="fn992">21</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>and the heart of the people melted</italic><sup><xref rid="fn993">22</xref></sup> (Josh. 7:6).<sup><xref rid="fn994">23</xref></sup> There are many other such instances.</p>
<p>SO THOU SHALT PUT AWAY. I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>u-vi&#x2019;arta</italic> (so thou shalt put away).</p>
<p>8. IF THERE ARISE A MATTER TOO HARD FOR THEE. Moses speaks to the judges. This follows the previous law because two witnesses are required in order to execute a person. The meaning of <italic>between blood and blood</italic> is, between innocent blood and guilty blood.<sup><xref rid="fn995">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>yippale</italic> (too hard) is similar to the word <italic>hayippale</italic> (is anything too hard) (Gen. 18:14). I have explained it there.<sup><xref rid="fn996">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>BETWEEN PLEA AND PLEA. With regard to money.</p>
<p>AND BETWEEN STROKE AND STROKE.<sup><xref rid="fn997">26</xref></sup> Such as wounds and bruises.<sup><xref rid="fn998">27</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Even matters of controversy</italic> is a general term.</p>
<p>THEN THOU SHALT ARISE, AND GET THEE UP. I have explained this before.<sup><xref rid="fn999">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES. For, as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn1000">29</xref></sup> there are <italic>kohanim</italic> who are not descended from Levi.<sup><xref rid="fn1001">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND UNTO THE JUDGE. The reference is to the king who writes a copy of the Torah from the one which is in the hands of the <italic>kohanim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1002">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND UNTO THE JUDGE. In the place where he is.<sup><xref rid="fn1003">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. ACCORDING TO THE LAW WHICH THEY SHALL TEACH THEE. With regard to the matter that is too hard for you.</p>
<p>12. EVEN THAT MAN SHALL DIE. The court shall put him to death. The reason for the latter is so that <italic>the people shall hear, and fear</italic> (v. 13). When Moses mentions the judge, he explains the laws that the judge must keep.</p>
<p>15. THOU SHALT IN ANY WISE SET HIM KING OVER THEE. This is optional.</p>
<p>WHOM THE LORD THY GOD SHALL CHOOSE. Via a prophet or via the <italic>urim</italic> (Ex. 28:30). The point of the clause is you shall not choose him.<sup><xref rid="fn1004">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU MAYEST NOT.<sup><xref rid="fn1005">34</xref></sup> From a rational point of view.<sup><xref rid="fn1006">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHO IS NOT THY BROTHER. Who is not of the family of Israel, and also one who is an Edomite even though Scripture refers to Edomites as &#x201C;your brother.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1007">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now in those days horses were brought from Egypt. Scripture&#x2019;s words concerning Solomon, <italic>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt</italic> (I Kings 10:29), is proof of this. The king would thus cause Israel to sin if he wanted to multiply his horses, for he would cause the people to return to Egypt. This is clearly so:<sup><xref rid="fn1008">37</xref></sup> God took Israel out of Egypt, and by going back they would desecrate God&#x2019;s name. Uriah the prophet fled to Egypt because his life was in danger.<sup><xref rid="fn1009">38</xref></sup> Also Jeremiah went to Egypt against his will.<sup><xref rid="fn1010">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. YE SHALL HENCEFORTH RETURN NO MORE. This was a commandment that was not written down.<sup><xref rid="fn1011">40</xref></sup> Some say that this law is derived from ye <italic>shall see them again no more for ever</italic> (Ex. 14:13). However, the latter has a different meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn1012">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THAT HIS HEART TURN NOT AWAY. For he will go after his lusts.</p>
<p>NEITHER SHALL HE GREATLY MULTIPLY TO HIMSELF SILVER AND GOLD. So that he does not punish<sup><xref rid="fn1013">42</xref></sup> Israel. Now Israel complained about Solomon who, because of his great love of money, <italic>made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones</italic> (I Kings 10:27). They said [to his son], <italic>Thy father made our yoke grievous</italic> (I Kings 12:10). Some say that they complained because of the buildings.<sup><xref rid="fn1014">43</xref></sup> However, this is not so, for strangers built the house.<sup><xref rid="fn1015">44</xref></sup> The latter is clearly stated in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1016">45</xref></sup> Look, following Solomon&#x2019;s death Adinoram, who was over the levy,<sup><xref rid="fn1017">46</xref></sup> was stoned to death by the Israelites (I Kings 10:18).<sup><xref rid="fn1018">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND IT SHALL BE, WHEN HE SITTETH UPON THE THRONE. At the beginning of his kingship.</p>
<p>A COPY. The meaning of <italic>mishneh</italic> is a second rendition.<sup><xref rid="fn1019">48</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn972"><sup>1</sup> That is, since Moses mentions that the <italic>asherah</italic> and the pillar are prohibited, he also mentions that it is prohibited to sacrifice any blemished animal to God, for these acts are an abomination to God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn973"><sup>2</sup> A blemished animal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn974"><sup>3</sup> As a gift. Will he accept it? No, he will reject it and despise you for insulting him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn975"><sup>4</sup> Such as the Passover or sin offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn976"><sup>5</sup> In private.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn977"><sup>6</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 23:7 (Vol. 1, p. 230) and Ex. 18:7 (Vol. 2, p. 351).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn978"><sup>7</sup> If we connect <italic>hetev</italic> to the word <italic>tov</italic> (good), the meaning of our clause is, then thou shalt inquire well.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn979"><sup>8</sup> Who worshipped idols. <italic>And thou shalt stone them</italic> cannot refer to both of them, for Scripture speaks of a man or a woman.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn980"><sup>9</sup> The verse speaks of a man who takes a mother and daughter, or a daughter and mother. <italic>They shall be burnt with fire, both he and they</italic> (ethen) can&#x2019;t refer to both women, for what sin did the first woman commit? It is only the second woman taken who is put to death. If he first takes the mother, then it is the daughter who is put to death.

<ftnote id="fn982"><sup>11</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s elaboration of the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn983"><sup>12</sup> The law of witnesses follows the law of idolatry because the punishment of idolaters requires two witnesses to the act of idol worship.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn984"><sup>13</sup> According to the Gaon two witnesses may testify before three witnesses. The latter may then testify as to what they heard. However, two witnesses cannot testify before two other witnesses. Thus according to the Gaon our verse should be read as follows: at the mouth of two witnesses who saw the event that they are testifying to, or at the mouth of three witnesses who heard it from two witnesses, shall he that is to die be put to death. The Gaon so interpreted our verse because he wanted to avoid the question, &#x201C;If two witnesses are enough to convict a person, why does Scripture go on to say or <italic>three witnesses</italic>?&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn985"><sup>14</sup> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 18</title>
<p>1. THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES, EVEN ALL THE TRIBE OF LEVI, SHALL HAVE NO PORTION. When Scripture mentions the laws of the king,<sup><xref rid="fn1020">1</xref></sup> who is the judge,<sup><xref rid="fn1021">2</xref></sup> it makes mention of the laws of the <italic>kohanim</italic>, who are the teachers of the Torah. After Scripture states that they have no inheritance,<sup><xref rid="fn1022">3</xref></sup> it states that they will take from the sacrificer<sup><xref rid="fn1023">4</xref></sup> the shoulder, the cheeks, and the maw:<sup><xref rid="fn1024">5</xref></sup> the shoulder from the body; the cheeks, which have the tongue between them, from the head; and the maw from the insides. There is a midrashic interpretation that since the <italic>kohen</italic> slaughters the peace offerings, he receives the shoulder as payment for the use of his shoulder in the slaughtering, the cheeks as payment for reciting the blessing,<sup><xref rid="fn1025">6</xref></sup> and the maw as payment for the investigation.<sup><xref rid="fn1026">7</xref></sup> However, according to the plain meaning of the text, these<sup><xref rid="fn1027">8</xref></sup> are better than the rest of the meat.<sup><xref rid="fn1028">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture also mentions the laws regarding the Levites,<sup><xref rid="fn1029">10</xref></sup> for they too<sup><xref rid="fn1030">11</xref></sup> will teach the Torah in the gates. The Book of Chronicles shows this to be the case.<sup><xref rid="fn1031">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. BESIDE THAT WHICH IS HIS DUE. Some say that <italic>mimkarav</italic> (which is his due) is similar to <italic>makkarekhem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1032">13</xref></sup> (them that bestow it upon you)<sup><xref rid="fn1033">14</xref></sup> in <italic>from them that bestow it upon you</italic> (II Kings 12:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1034">15</xref></sup> However, they are a bit off the mark. The rules of grammar will not accede to it.<sup><xref rid="fn1035">16</xref></sup> On the contrary, <italic>mimkarav</italic> is related to <italic>timkeru mimkar</italic> (sell aught) in <italic>and if thou sell aught</italic> (Lev. 25:14).<sup><xref rid="fn1036">17</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>le-vad mimkarav al ha-avot</italic> (beside that which is due according to the father&#x2019;s house)<sup><xref rid="fn1037">18</xref></sup> is, if the <italic>kohen</italic> sold his house, which he inherited from his father as Scripture states, <italic>then the house that was sold in the city of his</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1038">19</xref></sup> <italic>possession, shall go out</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1039">20</xref></sup> (Lev. 25:33). The latter explains <italic>according to the fathers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1040">21</xref></sup> The local <italic>kohanim</italic> shall not say to him, Look, you have money, you shall not in addition eat the sacred food with us. On the contrary, they shall eat like portions.<sup><xref rid="fn1041">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Moses concludes the laws pertaining to the judge<sup><xref rid="fn1042">23</xref></sup> and the <italic>kohen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1043">24</xref></sup> he mentions the laws regarding the prophet.<sup><xref rid="fn1044">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. ONE THAT MAKETH HIS SON OR HIS DAUGHTER TO PASS THROUGH THE FIRE. This was a form of idol worship, for we have among us today many gentiles who worship the fire.<sup><xref rid="fn1045">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>ANYONE THAT USETH DIVINATION.<sup><xref rid="fn1046">27</xref></sup> <italic>Kosem</italic> (one that useth divination) is most probably a general term. It refers to those who issue decrees and declare things will undoubtedly be so.<sup><xref rid="fn1047">28</xref></sup> The term <italic>gazerin</italic> (magicians) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1048">29</xref></sup> The word <italic>kesem</italic> (divine sentence) in <italic>A divine sentence is in the lips of the king</italic> (Prov. 16:10) is close in meaning to it. The particulars<sup><xref rid="fn1049">30</xref></sup> are a <italic>soothsayer</italic> (me&#x2019;onen), <italic>or an enchanter</italic> (menachesh), <italic>or a sorcerer</italic> (mechashef). It is also possible that <italic>kosem</italic> is a specific term for astrologers<sup><xref rid="fn1050">31</xref></sup> and that <italic>kesamim</italic> (divinations) refers to divination that astrologers make based on the primary and secondary stars.<sup><xref rid="fn1051">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>A SOOTHSAYER,<sup><xref rid="fn1052">33</xref></sup> OR AN ENCHANTER.<sup><xref rid="fn1053">34</xref></sup> I have explained these terms previously.<sup><xref rid="fn1054">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR A SORCERER.<sup><xref rid="fn1055">36</xref></sup> I have also explained this term.<sup><xref rid="fn1056">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. OR A CHARMER.<sup><xref rid="fn1057">38</xref></sup> One who calls the demons together.</p>
<p>OR ONE THAT CONSULTETH A GHOST OR A FAMILIAR SPIRIT. I have explained these terms before.<sup><xref rid="fn1058">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>OR A NECROMANCER. Such as those who go to cemeteries and take the bone of a dead person and, because of their imagination and madness, see shapes<sup><xref rid="fn1059">40</xref></sup> while they are awake<sup><xref rid="fn1060">41</xref></sup> or in a dream. All of these things<sup><xref rid="fn1061">42</xref></sup> are abominations to God. The truth is that a person must fully believe in his creator in his heart. When a person relies on his wisdom, and not on God, in seeking the truth and what will be in the future, his mind is deficient, for it is perverted. The person who wants to inquire,<sup><xref rid="fn1062">43</xref></sup> let him inquire from God via a prophet. Scripture therefore afterward reads, <italic>A prophet will the Lord&#x2026;raise up&#x2026;from the midst of thee</italic> (v. 15). The latter refers to Joshua. <italic>Unto him ye shall hearken</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>), which is later followed by <italic>and the children of Israel hearkened unto him</italic> (Deut. 34:9), is proof of this. The fact that we do not find any other prophet but Joshua entering Canaan<sup><xref rid="fn1063">44</xref></sup> is additional proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1064">45</xref></sup> It is also possible that our verse lays down a general rule for each and every prophet who will arise after Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1065">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. LIKE UNTO ME. Who is a prophet of God and not an enchanter.</p>
<p>19. I WILL REQUIRE IT OF HIM. His death is thus caused by God.<sup><xref rid="fn1066">47</xref></sup> What happened to the man who did not listen to the words of the prophet who said, <italic>Smite me, I pray thee</italic> (I Kings 20:35) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1067">48</xref></sup> Scripture states there that the prophet<sup><xref rid="fn1068">49</xref></sup> spoke <italic>by the word of the Lord</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1069">50</xref></sup> (I Kings 21:35), The prophet was previously known as a prophet of God.</p>
<p>22. WHEN A PROPHET SPEAKETH. The prophet Jeremiah similarly says, <italic>when the word of the prophet shall come to pass</italic> (Jer. 28:9) in the time predicted by the prophet.<sup><xref rid="fn1070">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Moses finished explaining the law relating to the soothsayers and their practices, which were practiced by the idolaters of the land, he warned<sup><xref rid="fn1071">52</xref></sup> that no innocent blood be shed in the land. The reason for this is that the land shall be pure from the abomination of the soothsayers, and it should also not be defiled by the shedding of innocent blood.</p>

It should be noted that according to the commentaries, Levite in our verse refers to a <italic>kohen</italic> from the house of Levi.</ftnote>

<p>3. THOU SHALT PREPARE THEE THE WAY. The cities should be in a place where the way<sup><xref rid="fn1072">1</xref></sup> is prepared<sup><xref rid="fn1073">2</xref></sup> and settled.<sup><xref rid="fn1074">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND DIVIDE. <italic>Ve-shillashta</italic> (and divide) means divide the land into three, or place a city of refuge in each third of the land.</p>
<p>5. HIS NEIGHBOR. <italic>Et re&#x2019;ehu</italic> means with his neighbor. There are many such cases.<sup><xref rid="fn1075">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>FETCHETH A STROKE. <italic>Ve-niddechah</italic> (fetcheth a stroke) is a <italic>nifal. Nidche</italic> (the dispersed of) in <italic>He gathereth together the dispersed of Israel</italic> (Ps. 147:2) is the <italic>kal</italic> form.</p>
<p>WITH THE AXE. <italic>Garzen</italic> (axe) refers to a metal instrument used to cut a tree down. It is related to the word <italic>nigzarti</italic> (I was cut off).<sup><xref rid="fn1076">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE HEAD SLIPPETH FROM THE HELVE. <italic>Venashal</italic> (slippeth) is similar to <italic>ve-nasa</italic> (shall set forward) (Num. 2:17).<sup><xref rid="fn1077">6</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>yishal</italic> (shall drop off) in <italic>for thine olives shall drop off</italic> (Deut. 28:40). The word <italic>ve-nashal</italic> (and shall cast) in <italic>and shall cast out many nations</italic> (Deut. 7:1) is transitive. However, <italic>ve-nashal</italic> (slippeth) in our verse is intransitive. According to a great grammarian the same is true of the word <italic>yasaf</italic> (more) in <italic>with a great voice, and it went on no more</italic> (Deut. 5:19) and <italic>yasaf</italic> (added) in <italic>For the Lord hath added sorrow</italic> (Jer. 45:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1078">7</xref></sup> However, I believe that they are both transitive.</p>
<p>6. AND SMITE HIM MORTALLY. <italic>Ve-hikkahu nefesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1079">8</xref></sup> (and smite him mortally) is short for <italic>ve-hikkahu makkat nefesh</italic> (and smite him with a mortal blow). He will strike him in a place where his soul will depart.</p>
<p>8. AND IF THE LORD THY GOD ENLARGE THY BORDER. If Israel observes the entire Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1080">9</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads,<sup><xref rid="fn1081">10</xref></sup> <italic>if thou shalt keep all this commandment</italic> (v. 9), the reference being to the commandment dealing with the three cities of refuge.<sup><xref rid="fn1082">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND TO WALK EVER IN HIS WAYS.<sup><xref rid="fn1083">12</xref></sup> Without any break in them.<sup><xref rid="fn1084">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. THOU SHALT NOT REMOVE THY NEIGHBOUR&#x2019;S LANDMARKS. The meaning of <italic>tassig</italic> (thou shalt&#x2026;remove) is known.<sup><xref rid="fn1085">14</xref></sup> Its meaning is similar to the word <italic>tasseg</italic> (remove) in <italic>Remove not the ancient landmark</italic> (Prov. 22:28). It is close in meaning to destroyed.<sup><xref rid="fn1086">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHICH THEY OF OLD TIME HAVE SET. The ones who divided up the land.<sup><xref rid="fn1087">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>[15. ONE WITNESS SHALL NOT RISE UP.] This section<sup><xref rid="fn1088">17</xref></sup> follows,<sup><xref rid="fn1089">18</xref></sup> because destroying the boundary markers<sup><xref rid="fn1090">19</xref></sup> leads to quarrels, blows, and murder. Scripture therefore goes on to state, following this, <italic>Life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth</italic> (v. 21). The one who claims that his neighbor removed his landmark must bring witnesses. Hence, Scripture reads, <italic>one witness shall not rise up</italic>, which means that two witnesses are required in cases involving murder, assault, landmark removal, or any matter.<sup><xref rid="fn1091">20</xref></sup> S<italic>hene edim</italic> (two witnesses) is an abridged phrase,<sup><xref rid="fn1092">21</xref></sup> for Scripture elsewhere reads, <italic>shenayim edim</italic> (two witnesses) (Deut. 17:6).</p>
<p>16. TO BEAR PERVERTED WITNESS AGAINST HIM. Such as accusing him of idol worship.</p>
<p>18. TESTIFIED. <italic>Anah</italic> means testified. The same law applies to flogging<sup><xref rid="fn1093">22</xref></sup> and fines.<sup><xref rid="fn1094">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>[21. AND THINE EYE SHALL NOT PITY.] This means thine eye shall not pity the false witness.<sup><xref rid="fn1095">24</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 20</title>
<p>1. WHEN THOU GOEST FORTH TO BATTLE. This is connected to <italic>And thine eye shall not pity</italic> (Deut. 19:21), for one is not to have pity.<sup><xref rid="fn1096">1</xref></sup> However, when going forth to war you should pity<sup><xref rid="fn1097">2</xref></sup> the man who has betrothed a woman, or built a house, or planted a vineyard, or one whose heart is faint.<sup><xref rid="fn1098">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. THAT THE PRIEST SHALL APPROACH. The <italic>kohen</italic> who has been anointed for war.<sup><xref rid="fn1099">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. FEAR NOT. In your heart.</p>
<p>NOR BE ALARMED. And flee.</p>
<p>NEITHER BE YE AFFRIGHTED. In deed.<sup><xref rid="fn1100">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. DEDICATED IT. <italic>Chanakho</italic> (dedicated it) is similar to the word <italic>chanukkat</italic> (dedication of) in <italic>the dedication offer of the altar</italic> (Num. 7:10). The word <italic>chanokh</italic> (train) in <italic>Train up a child</italic> (Prov. 22:6) is similar. Our rabbis, of blessed memory, learned from the latter that we train (<italic>mekhannechin</italic>) children.</p>
<p>The reason that [one who has not dedicated his house is released from service] is that such a man&#x2019;s heart and desire is to dedicate his house. Look, his mind will be upon his house, not on the battle. He will therefore flee and cause others to flee.</p>
<p>6. USED THE FRUIT THEREOF. The word <italic>chillelo</italic> (used the fruit thereof) is connected to the word <italic>challilim</italic> (flutes), for they were in the habit of dancing<sup><xref rid="fn1101">6</xref></sup> in the vineyards<sup><xref rid="fn1102">7</xref></sup> (Jud. 21:21).<sup><xref rid="fn1103">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND WHAT MAN IS THERE THAT HATH BETROTHED A WIFE, AND HATH NOT TAKEN HER? In marriage.<sup><xref rid="fn1104">9</xref></sup> Look, this verse is a sign that there are people who die when their time comes.<sup><xref rid="fn1105">10</xref></sup> However, the one who dies in battle dies before his time. Hence David said, <italic>or he shall go down into battle, and be swept away</italic> (I Sam. 26:10).<sup><xref rid="fn1106">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. THAT IS FEARFUL. To strike another person.</p>
<p>AND FAINT-HEARTED. To suffer someone&#x2019;s blow.</p>
<p>HIS BRETHREN&#x2019;S HEART. Look, the word <italic>et</italic> appears superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1107">12</xref></sup> However, its meaning is as I have previously explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1108">13</xref></sup> It indicates the thing itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1109">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. SHALL BE APPOINTED. <italic>U-fakedu</italic> (shall be appointed) is related to the word <italic>pekod</italic> (appoint).</p>
<p>10. THEN PROCLAIM PEACE UNTO IT. The meaning of <italic>ve-karata</italic> is proclaim unto it.<sup><xref rid="fn1110">15</xref></sup> This is a commandment, or it is most likely an option.<sup><xref rid="fn1111">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND IF IT WILL MAKE NO PEACE. The meaning of <italic>tashlim</italic> is, it will make peace.</p>
<p>15. WHICH ARE VERY FAR OFF FROM THEE. Who are not of the seven nations.</p>
<p>16. THOU SHALT SAVE ALIVE NOTHING. It is forbidden to give them food or drink. The general rule is that they were to kill them if possible. The latter applied to their days. Moses does not mention the Girgashites,<sup><xref rid="fn1112">17</xref></sup> for they were the least and the smallest among them.</p>
<p>19. FOR IS THE TREE OF THE FIELD MAN.<sup><xref rid="fn1113">18</xref></sup> I have previously explained in the <italic>Sefer Ha-Yesod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1114">19</xref></sup> that it is possible in all languages to be brief and to apply an abbreviated style, as in &#x201C;an ass bread&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1115">20</xref></sup> (I Sam. 16:20).<sup><xref rid="fn1116">21</xref></sup> However, it is impossible to leave out the word <italic>lo</italic> (no, not),<sup><xref rid="fn1117">22</xref></sup> for in this case the meaning would be reversed.<sup><xref rid="fn1118">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>A great Spanish grammarian<sup><xref rid="fn1119">24</xref></sup> said that a <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1120">25</xref></sup> has been omitted.<sup><xref rid="fn1121">26</xref></sup> Our clause should be interpreted as if written, <italic>hakhi adam etz ha-sadeh</italic> (for is the tree of the field man).<sup><xref rid="fn1122">27</xref></sup> Now this interpretation does not appear correct to me. Why would Scripture say that you shall not destroy fruit trees, because, unlike a human being, they cannot run away from you?<sup><xref rid="fn1123">28</xref></sup> I believe there is no need for all this.<sup><xref rid="fn1124">29</xref></sup> The following is the meaning of our clause. For thou mayest eat of them, but thou shalt not cut them down, for the tree of the field is man; that is, the life of man is supported by trees.<sup><xref rid="fn1125">30</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>For he taketh a life to pledge</italic> (Deut. 24:6), which is short for, for he taketh that which sustains man&#x2019;s life to pledge.</p>
<p>BUT THOU SHALT NOT CUT THEM DOWN. This is connected to <italic>that it should he besieged of thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1126">31</xref></sup> Look, do not destroy a fruit tree, which is a source of sustenance for human life. Be that as it may, you are permitted to eat of it but you are prohibited from destroying it so that the city will be besieged because of you. The fact that Scripture then states <italic>thou mayest destroy and cut down</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1127">32</xref></sup> <italic>that thou mayest build bulwarks</italic> (v. 20), is proof of this.</p>
<p>20. UNTIL IT FALL. Scripture would not have said a <italic>long time</italic> (v. 19) if the city were not mighty.<sup><xref rid="fn1128">33</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1096"><sup>1</sup> On the guilty or on the one who is obligated to go into battle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1097"><sup>2</sup> And exempt from battle.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1102"><sup>7</sup> To the accompaniment of flutes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1103"><sup>8</sup> According to I.E. we should render our clause, and did not play music over it; i.e., he did not harvest his vineyard.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1104"><sup>9</sup> Brought her into his house. There were two stages to marriage in ancient Israel, <italic>erusin</italic> (betrothal) and <italic>nesu&#x2019;in</italic> (marriage). In the first stage the woman, though married, still lived in her father&#x2019;s house. In the second stage she went to live with her husband. The marriage was not consummated till the second stage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1105"><sup>10</sup> Thus the man who has married a woman but has not consummated the marriage is exempt from the army because his time to die has probably not yet come. He will therefore be able to consummate his marriage if he does not go forth to war.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1106"><sup>11</sup> The entire clause reads: <italic>or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle, and be swept away</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1107"><sup>12</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>ve-lo yimmas et levav echav</italic> (lest brethren&#x2019;s heart melt). The particle <italic>et</italic> usually connects an active verb with the object. However, <italic>yimmas</italic> is in the <italic>nifal</italic>; it is passive. Hence the particle <italic>et</italic> appears to be superfluous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1108"><sup>13</sup> That <italic>et</italic> does not always connect an active verb with the direct object. See I.E. on Ex. 10:8 (Vol. 2, pp. 187,188).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1110"><sup>15</sup> In other words, <italic>ve-karata</italic> is an imperative.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1113"><sup>18</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ki ha-adam etz ha-sadeh</italic>. The latter literally means for man is a tree of the field. This, as I.E. goes on to say, does not make sense. Hence the interpretations which follow.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 21</title>
<p>1. IF ONE BE FOUND SLAIN. As Scripture mentions the war against enemies,<sup><xref rid="fn1129">1</xref></sup> it goes on to say what the law is if one fights against his fellow<sup><xref rid="fn1130">2</xref></sup> and a corpse is found in the land of Israel, and the one who slew him is unknown.<sup><xref rid="fn1131">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. THY ELDERS. The elders and judges of the cities that are close to the body.</p>
<p>3. A HEIFER OF THE HERD, WHICH HATH NOT BEEN WROUGHT WITH. Never used for plowing.<sup><xref rid="fn1132">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WHICH HATH NOT DRAWN IN THE YOKE. To bring stones, as is the practice with heifers.<sup><xref rid="fn1133">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. ROUGH. The word <italic>etan</italic> (rough) means mighty.</p>
<p>AND SHALL BREAK&#x2026;THE NECK. <italic>Ve-arefu</italic> (and they shall break) means they shall remove the back of the neck of the heifer.<sup><xref rid="fn1134">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THE PRIESTS THE SONS OF LEVI SHALL COME NEAR. The priests (<italic>kohanim</italic>) who are clearly of the sons of Levi.<sup><xref rid="fn1135">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ACCORDING TO THEIR WORD SHALL&#x2026;BE. The punishment for every controversy and every stroke.<sup><xref rid="fn1136">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND ALL THE ELDERS OF THAT CITY. The elders referred to in <italic>then thy elders&#x2026;shall come forth</italic> (v. 2).</p>
<p>7. [SHED.] The <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>shafekhu</italic> (shed) indicates the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn1137">9</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>shafekhu ashurai</italic> (my steps slipped) (Ps. 73:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1138">10</xref></sup> However, interpreting it midrashically, the <italic>heh</italic> refers to each one of the hands, for the word <italic>yad</italic> (hand) is in most cases feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn1139">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>NEITHER HAVE OUR EYES SEEN IT. It is possible that God commanded the city closest to the slain to perform this<sup><xref rid="fn1140">12</xref></sup> because if the city had not committed a similar deed, then the murder of a person near their city would not have occurred. God&#x2019;s thoughts are deep and infinitely beyond our comprehension.<sup><xref rid="fn1141">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY SHALL SPEAK AND SAY. <italic>Ve-anu ve-ameru</italic> (and they shall speak and say) is similar to <italic>ve-anita ve-amarta</italic> (and thou shalt speak and say) (Deut. 26:5). I will explain it there.<sup><xref rid="fn1142">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. FORGIVE, O LORD, THY PEOPLE. Who erred and did not guard the dangerous roads.<sup><xref rid="fn1143">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHALL BE FORGIVEN. A <italic>tav</italic> has been omitted in the word <italic>ve-nikapper</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1144">16</xref></sup> (shall be forgiven). It is similar to the word <italic>venivasseru</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1145">17</xref></sup> (may be taught) in <italic>that all women may be taught</italic> (Ezek. 23:48). They<sup><xref rid="fn1146">18</xref></sup> are a combination of two forms, the <italic>nifal</italic> and the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic>.</p>
<p>Scripture mentions <italic>whom thou hast redeemed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1147">19</xref></sup> to indicate that as You redeemed Israel from Egypt as a manifestation of Your great mercies, similarly redeem them from this blood and the punishment for its shedding.</p>
<p>9. SO SHALT THOU PUT AWAY THE INNOCENT BLOOD. The meaning of <italic>the innocent blood</italic> is, the punishment for the shedding of the innocent blood.<sup><xref rid="fn1148">20</xref></sup> On the other hand, the word <italic>ha-dam ha-naki</italic> (the innocent blood) is short for <italic>ha-dam, dam ha-naki</italic> (the blood, the innocent blood).<sup><xref rid="fn1149">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that the meaning of <italic>so shalt thou put away the innocent blood</italic> is, you must eradicate the shedding of blood. However, in my opinion, and I have mentioned this before, it means no innocent blood will be shed in your land if you do what is right in the eyes of God. The latter is in keeping with the secret that the reward of sin is sin, and the reward of a commandment is the commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn1150">22</xref></sup></p>
<h1>KI TETZE</h1>
<p>10. WHEN THOU GOEST FORTH TO BATTLE. This section is connected with <italic>When thou shalt besiege a city</italic> (Deut. 20:19).<sup><xref rid="fn1151">23</xref></sup> The section dealing with the decapitated heifer<sup><xref rid="fn1152">24</xref></sup> was inserted between them because it deals with a slain person found in the Land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1153">25</xref></sup> This law does not apply outside of the Land of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn1154">26</xref></sup> and certainly not in time of war.<sup><xref rid="fn1155">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. A WOMAN. The rabbis have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn1156">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF GOODLY FORM. In his own eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn1157">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THOU HAST A DESIRE UNTO HER. You will desire to take her for a wife,<sup><xref rid="fn1158">30</xref></sup> for after this Scripture states, <italic>and be her husband. So I took her to be my wife</italic> (le-ishah) (Gen. 12:19) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1159">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THEN THOU SHALT BRING HER HOME TO THY HOUSE; AND SHE SHALL SHAVE HER HEAD. Some say that she shaves her head as he may have desired her because of her hair.</p>
<p>PARE. <italic>Ve-asetah et tzipparneha</italic> (and pare her nails) means she shall let her nails grow long so that she will appear disgusting in his eyes.</p>
<p>13. AND SHE SHALL PUT THE RAIMENT OF HER CAPTIVITY FROM OFF HER. For he may have desired her because of her beautiful garments.</p>
<p>AND BEWAIL. So that he is no longer happy with her.<sup><xref rid="fn1160">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>A FULL MONTH. Perhaps his desire will cool.</p>
<p>Others say:<sup><xref rid="fn1161">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>[12. SHE SHALL SHAVE HER HEAD.] Because she is unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn1162">34</xref></sup> The law regarding the leper is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1163">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND PARE. <italic>Ve-asetah</italic> (and pare)<sup><xref rid="fn1164">36</xref></sup> means and fix. Its fixing consists in cutting off the excess.<sup><xref rid="fn1165">37</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>asah</italic> (trimmed)<sup><xref rid="fn1166">38</xref></sup> in <italic>nor trimmed his heard</italic> (II Sam. 19:25) and in <italic>And instead of curled hair</italic> (ma&#x2019;aseh<sup><xref rid="fn1167">39</xref></sup> miksheh) <italic>baldness</italic> (Is. 3:24). The main meaning of the word <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh</italic> (work) in Scripture is fixing,<sup><xref rid="fn1168">40</xref></sup> except for instances when something unseemly follows.<sup><xref rid="fn1169">41</xref></sup> However, even in the latter instance the reference might be to complete an evil deed.</p>
<p>AND SHE SHALL PUT THE RAIMENT OF HER CAPTIVITY FROM OFF HER. For it is filthy.<sup><xref rid="fn1170">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SHALL REMAIN IN THY HOUSE, AND BE WAIL&#x2026;A FULL MONTH. This means she shall remain in your house a month to cry.<sup><xref rid="fn1171">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER. If close by.<sup><xref rid="fn1172">44</xref></sup> Some say that she bewails her father and mother because they did not convert to Judaism.<sup><xref rid="fn1173">45</xref></sup> However, I believe that reason teaches us that every person is obligated to honor his father and his mother while they live and also after their deaths. The meaning of <italic>and bewail&#x2026;</italic> is, she shall mourn her parents if they were killed while she was taken captive in the same manner that an Israelite women mourns, for she is converting to Judaism.</p>
<p>Scripture had no need to mention that she shall bathe,<sup><xref rid="fn1174">46</xref></sup> for it is necessary for her to be purified by the waters of sprinkling,<sup><xref rid="fn1175">47</xref></sup> as Scripture earlier states, <italic>ye and your captives</italic> (Num. 31:19).<sup><xref rid="fn1176">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND AFTER THAT THOU MAYEST GO INTO HER, AND BE HER HUSBAND.] Our rabbis, of blessed memory, said that he has to wait three months.<sup><xref rid="fn1177">49</xref></sup> Even though the words of our sages need no support<sup><xref rid="fn1178">50</xref></sup> I offer the following <italic>as</italic> proof, <italic>And it came to pass about three months after</italic> (Gen. 38:24).<sup><xref rid="fn1179">51</xref></sup> The latter is the time when the fetus begins to move. It is prohibited to have sexual relations with a women when one is in doubt as to whether she is pregnant or not, because of the uncertain paternity of the fetus; for some women give birth two months short of the normal term.<sup><xref rid="fn1180">52</xref></sup> Others give birth later than the normal term.<sup><xref rid="fn1181">53</xref></sup> However, the latter rarely occurs.<sup><xref rid="fn1182">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>A FULL MONTH. <italic>Yerach yamim</italic> (a full month) is similar to <italic>chodesh yamim</italic> (a whole month) (Num. 11:21).<sup><xref rid="fn1183">55</xref></sup> I have explained this previously.<sup><xref rid="fn1184">56</xref></sup> A month is called a <italic>yerach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1185">57</xref></sup> because the moon is its basis.</p>
<p>14. THEN THOU SHALT LET HER GO.<sup><xref rid="fn1186">58</xref></sup> You shall do to her as she desires.<sup><xref rid="fn1187">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT THOU SHALT NOT SELL HER AT ALL FOR MONEY. Scripture speaks of what is widely practiced.<sup><xref rid="fn1188">60</xref></sup> Its true meaning is, do not sell her.</p>
<p>THOU SHALT NOT DEAL WITH HER AS WITH A SLAVE. The word <italic>titammer</italic> (deal as with a slave) is similar to the word <italic>ve-hitammer</italic> (and he deal as with a slave) in <italic>and he deal with him as a slave</italic> (Deut. 24:7). The word is not found a third time.<sup><xref rid="fn1189">61</xref></sup> The meaning of the word has to be ascertained from its context. It means deceitfully.<sup><xref rid="fn1190">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. BELOVED. In his eyes, not in the eyes of God.<sup><xref rid="fn1191">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT WAS HATED. <italic>Seni&#x2019;ah</italic> (hated) is an adjective. This section follows<sup><xref rid="fn1192">64</xref></sup> because the preceding section<sup><xref rid="fn1193">65</xref></sup> reads, <italic>and thou hast a desire unto her</italic> (v. 11)<sup><xref rid="fn1194">66</xref></sup> <italic>and&#x2026;if thou have no delight in her</italic> (v. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn1195">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. IN THE DAY THAT HE CAUSETH HIS SONS TO INHERIT. When he is in good health; or on the day of his demise when he is deathly ill;<sup><xref rid="fn1196">68</xref></sup> or the law courts cause his sons to inherit.<sup><xref rid="fn1197">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>MAKE&#x2026;FIRST-BORN. In word<sup><xref rid="fn1198">70</xref></sup> and in status.</p>
<p>[THAT HE MAY NOT.] <italic>Lo yukhal</italic> (that he may not) is to be understood like its counterparts.<sup><xref rid="fn1199">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. HE SHALL ACKNOWLEDGE. He shall acknowledge him by an act,<sup><xref rid="fn1200">72</xref></sup> or he shall admit before others who the firstborn is, if the first-born is in a place where he is unknown, or he is obligated right at the beginning to acknowledge which one of his sons is the first-born should they be twins.</p>
<p>BY GIVING HIM A DOUBLE PORTION. The first-born shall take two parts. If there are three sons let them imagine that there are four and the first-born shall take two parts. If there are two sons let them imagine that there are three, and so in all cases. In my opinion this too is the meaning of <italic>I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me</italic> (II Kings 2:9), as I explained in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn1201">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR HE IS THE FIRST-FRUITS OF HIS STRENGTH. The one known as first-born. Scripture speaks of the upright.<sup><xref rid="fn1202">74</xref></sup> All of Israel are presumed to be upright.<sup><xref rid="fn1203">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. STUBBORN AND REBELLIOUS. Towards God and towards the parents if they be God-fearing.<sup><xref rid="fn1204">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>STUBBORN. The word <italic>soreh</italic> (stubborn) is similar to the word <italic>sorre&#x2019;ah</italic> (stubborn) in <italic>like a stubborn heifer</italic> (Hos. 4:16). He does not keep the positive commandments.</p>
<p>AND REBELLIOUS. With regard to the negative commandments.</p>
<p>AND THOUGH THEY CHASTEN HIM. In the presence of witnesses. The parents are commanded to take hold of him and bring him [to the elders]. The words of tradition are true.<sup><xref rid="fn1205">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>[20.] HE IS A GLUTTON. The meaning of <italic>zolel</italic> (glutton) is explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1206">78</xref></sup> It refers to one who gluttonously devours meat. However, the term refers to anyone who commits himself to all that he lusts for, to all that his desires ask of him.<sup><xref rid="fn1207">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND A DRUNKARD. <italic>Sove</italic> refers to one who drinks a lot. It refers to a drunkard. This individual is essentially a heretic.<sup><xref rid="fn1208">80</xref></sup> He desires life in this world only for eating and drinking.</p>
<p>This portion<sup><xref rid="fn1209">81</xref></sup> was placed here because of the <italic>woman of goodly form</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1210">82</xref></sup> <italic>And his</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1211">83</xref></sup> <italic>mother&#x2019;s name was Shelomith</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1212">84</xref></sup> (Lev. 24:11) and the hint which I gave with reference to the sons of Aaron<sup><xref rid="fn1213">85</xref></sup> are proof of this.</p>
<p>22. AND THOU HANG HIM. We have received from the rabbis, of blessed memory, traditions regarding those who are hanged.<sup><xref rid="fn1214">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. FOR HE THAT IS HANGED IS A REPROACH UNTO GOD.<sup><xref rid="fn1215">87</xref></sup> For he cursed God.<sup><xref rid="fn1216">88</xref></sup> However, according to the plain meaning of the text, God is the subject.<sup><xref rid="fn1217">89</xref></sup> The curse comes to all places close to the hanged.<sup><xref rid="fn1218">90</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn1219">91</xref></sup> has a secret connected to the soul.<sup><xref rid="fn1220">92</xref></sup> Scripture therefore goes on to say, <italic>that thou defile not thy land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1221">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>This section follows because of the war,<sup><xref rid="fn1222">94</xref></sup> for Scripture first states, <italic>When thou goest forth to battle</italic> (Deut. 20:1). Now the incident at Gibeon<sup><xref rid="fn1223">95</xref></sup> shows that the purpose of the law which says that his body shall not remain upon the tree all night is not out of respect for the deceased but rather out of respect for the land,<sup><xref rid="fn1224">96</xref></sup> for the law of the Canaanites and the law of the Israelites differ.<sup><xref rid="fn1225">97</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1129"><sup>1</sup> In the previous chapter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1130"><sup>2</sup> And kills him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1131"><sup>3</sup> In other words, the previous chapter deals with war against enemies. Our chapter deals with conflict between Israelites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1132"><sup>4</sup> The heifer was not tied to a plow. The Hebrew reads <italic>lo ubbad bah</italic> (which hath not been wrought with). I.E. interprets <italic>ubbad</italic> as referring to plowing, for Scripture later uses a word from this root in the sense of ploughed. Compare, <italic>lo ye&#x2019;aved bo</italic> (which may neither be plowed) (v. 4).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1133"><sup>5</sup> They are used for pulling wagons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1134"><sup>6</sup> That is, they shall decapitate it. <italic>Oref</italic> means back of the neck. <italic>Ve-arefu</italic> literally means they shall neck it. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1135"><sup>7</sup> There are some who are called <italic>kohanim</italic> who are not descended from the tribe of Levi. See I.E. on Deut. 17:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1136"><sup>8</sup> Wound. See I.E. on Deut. 17:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1137"><sup>9</sup> A <italic>vav</italic> is usually used to indicate the third person plural perfect. In our verse a <italic>heh</italic> is used in place of the <italic>vav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1138"><sup>10</sup> Here too the word <italic>shafekhu</italic> is spelled with a <italic>heh</italic> in place of a <italic>vav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1139"><sup>11</sup> If we ignore the vowels, then our word reads <italic>shafekhah. Shafekhah</italic> is the third person perfect feminine. In this case our verse reads: <italic>yadenu shafekhah</italic> (our hands it has spilled). According to I.E. a combination of the plural with the singular refers to each one of the plural. See I.E. on Gen. 49:22 (Vol. 1, p. 441).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1140"><sup>12</sup> Ritual.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1141"><sup>13</sup> Hence it is very difficult to understand the details of the ritual which they must perform.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1142"><sup>14</sup> See I.E. on Deut. 26:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1143"><sup>15</sup> And are thus indirectly responsible for the death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1144"><sup>16</sup> The word should have read <italic>ve-nitkapper</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1145"><sup>17</sup> The word should have read <italic>ue-nitvassseru</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1146"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Ve-nikapper</italic> and <italic>ve-nivasseru</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1147"><sup>19</sup> The question is, why add this appellation to Israel? The Bible does not usually describe Israel in this manner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1148"><sup>20</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>So shalt thou put away the innocent blood</italic> (ha-dam hanaki) <italic>from the midst of thee</italic>. The question arises, &#x201C;What does this clause mean?&#x201D; The innocent blood has already been shed, i.e., put away. Hence I.E. points out that <italic>ha-dam ha-naki</italic> is short for <italic>onesh ha-dam ha-naki</italic> (the punishment for the innocent blood), and our verse teaches that by performing this ritual you remove from your midst the punishment for the shedding of innocent blood. See Meijler.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1149"><sup>21</sup> According to Meijler our verse is interpreted as if written <italic>shofekh hadam, dam ha-naki</italic>, the spiller of innocent blood. That is, if after the ritual is performed the murderer is discovered, you shall put away the shedder of blood, of innocent blood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1150"><sup>22</sup> <italic>Avot</italic> 2:1. If innocent blood was shed near the city it was because the people of the city committed a similar crime. Thus the wages of sin is more sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1151"><sup>23</sup> Both deal with war.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1152"><sup>24</sup> Verses 1-9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1153"><sup>25</sup> When one goes to war he encounters slain people. There is thus a thematic connection between the sections.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1154"><sup>26</sup> For verse 1 explicitly states, <italic>in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1155"><sup>27</sup> In the Land of Israel. Thus Scripture contrasts the law regarding finding a slain person in time of peace and finding one in time of war.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1156"><sup>28</sup> The rabbis tell us that the law also applies to married women. See <italic>Sifre</italic> on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1157"><sup>29</sup> In other words, the law applies even in cases where most people would consider the captive woman unattractive. See <italic>Sifre</italic> on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1158"><sup>30</sup> Our verse literally reads: and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee for a woman (<italic>le-ishah</italic>). &#x201C;Wouldest take her to thee for a woman&#x201D; might mean that the Israelite merely wants to have sex with her. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that the intention is to marry her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1159"><sup>31</sup> That I took her to be my woman means I took her to be my wife.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1160"><sup>32</sup> So that he no longer enjoys her company, for she is morose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1161"><sup>33</sup> What follows is an alternate interpretation of verses 12 and 13. It may be a later insertion into the commentary by I.E., for he repeats the verse. It should be noted that a similar phenomenon appears at the end of his comments on Ex. 20:14 and in his comments on Ex. 34:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1162"><sup>34</sup> Ritually unclean.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1163"><sup>35</sup> The leper shaves his head when undergoing purification. See Lev. 14:8,9.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1170"><sup>42</sup> Her garments are most probably soiled. This interpretation, unlike the previous one, does not believe that he removes her garments of captivity because they were the cause of her captor&#x2019;s desire for her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1171"><sup>43</sup> For her father and her mother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1172"><sup>44</sup> If her parents were recently killed, that is, if they were killed in the war. Weiser believes that the reference is to her parents&#x2019; residence. If the place of their residence is close by, then the captive woman can ascertain the fate of her parents. <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads, if he (her captor) killed them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1173"><sup>45</sup> In this case she bewails her parents even they are still alive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1174"><sup>46</sup> In a <italic>mikveh</italic>, a pool of water which purifies the impure. All converts have to immerse themselves in a <italic>mikveh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1175"><sup>47</sup> Hebrew, <italic>me niddah</italic>. According to Rabbinic interpretation the reference is to a <italic>mikveh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1176"><sup>48</sup> Shall purify yourselves in the &#x201C;waters of sprinkling.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1177"><sup>49</sup> Before marrying the captive woman, in order to ascertain the paternity of the child that she might be carrying. See <italic>Sifre</italic> on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1178"><sup>50</sup> That it takes three months before one is certain as to whether or not a woman is pregnant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1179"><sup>51</sup> Three months after Tamar had intercourse with Judah her pregnancy first became evident.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1180"><sup>52</sup> Thus if a woman gives birth after nine months and had intercourse with one man nine months ago, and intercourse with another man seven months ago, we do not know whether she carried for nine months and the first man is the father, or she had the child prematurely and the second man is the father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1181"><sup>53</sup> At 11 months it is thus possible for the captor to wait three months before taking the captive woman and for the latter to have a child 8 months later without the captor being the husband. This being the case, why did the rabbis say that the captor has to wait three months? They should have said that he should wait four months.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1182"><sup>54</sup> The rabbis were not concerned with what occurs rarely.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1183"><sup>55</sup> Both terms mean a full month.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1184"><sup>56</sup> The term <italic>chodesh yamim</italic>. See I.E. on Gen. 4:4 (Vol. 1, p. 81). According to I.E., <italic>chodesh yamim</italic> refers to a complete cycle of the month.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1187"><sup>59</sup> I.E. takes the word <italic>nafshah</italic> to mean her desire. He interprets <italic>veshilachta le-nafshah</italic> as you shall allow her to do whatever she wants.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1191"><sup>63</sup> Contra the Rabbinic interpretation. According to the Talmud, &#x201C;hated&#x201D; means hated by God, i.e., taken in a marriage which God hates, that is, in a prohibited marriage (such as a <italic>kohen</italic> marrying a divorced woman).

<title>CHAPTER 22</title>
<p>1. THOU SHALT NOT SEE THY BROTHER&#x2019;S OX. Even when you go out to war.<sup><xref rid="fn1226">1</xref></sup> This is midrashic.</p>
<p>[2.] THEN THOU SHALT BRING IT HOME.<sup><xref rid="fn1227">2</xref></sup> If you are coming back<sup><xref rid="fn1228">3</xref></sup> or you command someone; that is, you give it to an honest person for safekeeping. <sup><xref rid="fn1229">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HIDE THYSELF. This is connected to <italic>Thou shalt not</italic> see.<sup><xref rid="fn1230">5</xref></sup> Scripture mentions the ox and the sheep (v. 1). The ass was previously mentioned (Ex. 23:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1231">6</xref></sup> The same law applies to all beasts.</p>
<p>3. THOU MAYEST NOT. <italic>Lo tukhal</italic> (thou mayest not)<sup><xref rid="fn1232">7</xref></sup> is to be understood like its counterparts.<sup><xref rid="fn1233">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. FALLEN DOWN. <italic>Nofelim</italic> (fallen down) means crouching. The word <italic>nofelim</italic> is a general term.<sup><xref rid="fn1234">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU SHALT SURELY HELP HIM TO LIFT THEM UP AGAIN. Not by yourself.<sup><xref rid="fn1235">10</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>thou shalt surely release it with him</italic> (Ex. 23:5).</p>
<p>5. A WOMAN SHALL NOT WEAR THAT WHICH PERTAINETH UNTO A MAN. This law was stated here because Scripture deals with going out to war. Women were created only to have children.<sup><xref rid="fn1236">11</xref></sup> If a woman joins men in going to war she will come to engage in illicit sexual relations on the way.<sup><xref rid="fn1237">12</xref></sup> The law that states <italic>neither shall a man put on a woman&#x2019;s garment</italic> is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1238">13</xref></sup> The reason for this law is as follows. If a male who does not have a full beard<sup><xref rid="fn1239">14</xref></sup> mixes with women, then he and they will have sexual relations without anyone knowing.<sup><xref rid="fn1240">15</xref></sup> This law indicates that the custom of Israel was for the garments of men to be unlike the garments of women. There was a definite difference between the garments.<sup><xref rid="fn1241">16</xref></sup> This is also the practice in most countries.</p>
<p>Some say that our verse speaks of unnatural intercourse.<sup><xref rid="fn1242">17</xref></sup> However, there is no need for this interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn1243">18</xref></sup> The fact is that God abominates the one who changes the works of the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn1244">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>CHANCE. The word <italic>yikkare</italic> (chance) is similar to <italic>nikro nikreti</italic> (As I happened by chance) (II Sam. 1:6). These words have the meaning of chance.<sup><xref rid="fn1247">22</xref></sup> It is close in meaning to &#x201C;meet.&#x201D;</p>
<p>[YOUNG ONES.] The <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>efrochim</italic> (young ones) is superfluous. It is like the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>u-ve-ezro&#x2019;akha</italic> (and with your arm) (Jer. 32:21).<sup><xref rid="fn1248">23</xref></sup> It is very cruel to crush a mother with her children. Hence the reason for this law. The same applies to an ox <sup><xref rid="fn1249">24</xref></sup> or a sheep.<sup><xref rid="fn1250">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH THEE. For God will pity you and do good things for you.</p>
<p>AND THAT THOU MAYEST PROLONG THY DAYS. As you did not exterminate all of the nest but left its root.<sup><xref rid="fn1251">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. WHEN THOU BUILDEST A NEW HOUSE. This section<sup><xref rid="fn1252">27</xref></sup> is placed here because it deals with Israel in its land after they wage war. Scripture opens with the law dealing with a house.</p>
<p>A PARAPET. The meaning of <italic>ma&#x2019;akeh</italic> (parapet) is known from its context. It has no neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn1253">28</xref></sup> A grammarian connected it to the word <italic>akat</italic> (oppression of) in <italic>the oppression of the wicked</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1254">29</xref></sup> (Ps. 55:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1255">30</xref></sup> However, he oppressed himself.<sup><xref rid="fn1256">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>IF ANY MAN FALL.<sup><xref rid="fn1257">32</xref></sup> Scripture speaks of the end result.<sup><xref rid="fn1258">33</xref></sup> The following are similar: <italic>The dead shall be put to death</italic> (Deut. 17:6);<sup><xref rid="fn1259">34</xref></sup> <italic>And stripped the naked of their garments</italic> (Job 22:6);<sup><xref rid="fn1260">35</xref></sup> <italic>And the children</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1261">36</xref></sup> <italic>struggled together</italic> (Gen. 25:22). There are an innumerable number of words that are named because of the end result. We do not know if this is linguistic style or prophetic statements, as in <italic>and pursued as far as Dan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1262">37</xref></sup> (Gen. 14:14); <italic>unto the valley of Eshcol</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1263">38</xref></sup> (Num. 13:23); and <italic>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1264">39</xref></sup> (Gen. 2:24).</p>
<p>After laying down the law dealing with the house, Scripture goes on to deal with the laws of seeds and plants, for after entering the land the Israelite would build a house and then plant.</p>
<p>9. THOU SHALT NOT SOW THY VINEYARD. The following is the meaning of <italic>pen tikdash</italic> (lest the fullness): Rabbi Menachem ben Saruk the Sephardi has already explained in his notebook that the word <italic>tikdash</italic> (fullness) is related to the word <italic>kodesh</italic> (holy).<sup><xref rid="fn1265">40</xref></sup> [The product of two seeds sown together becomes holy] because one mixes with the other.<sup><xref rid="fn1266">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. THOU SHALT NOT PLOW WITH AN OX AND AN ASS. This law is connected to the one dealing with sowing two kinds of seed. God had mercy on his creatures. An ass is not as strong as an ox. The law prohibiting the mixture of linen and wool<sup><xref rid="fn1267">42</xref></sup> follows<sup><xref rid="fn1268">43</xref></sup> because Scripture earlier mentioned the prohibition of mixing seeds. This law was previously mentioned in general terms.<sup><xref rid="fn1269">44</xref></sup> However, Scripture is specific here. It limits the prohibition to wool and linen, and not to any other kinds of material.</p>
<p>12. THOU SHALT MAKE TWISTED CORDS. The deniers<sup><xref rid="fn1270">45</xref></sup> say that this is a separate commandment<sup><xref rid="fn1271">46</xref></sup> pertaining to nighttime. It is similar to the fringes that are to be worn during the day. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>wherewith thou coverest thyself</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1272">47</xref></sup> However, the transmitters of tradition say that our verse speaks of the fringes that are to be worn during the day.<sup><xref rid="fn1273">48</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>gedilim</italic> (twisted cords) is similar to the word <italic>gedilim</italic> (wreaths) which is employed with regard to the building of the temple. Compare, <italic>wreaths</italic> (gedilim) <italic>of chainwork</italic> (I Kings 7:17).<sup><xref rid="fn1274">49</xref></sup> The deniers connect the word <italic>gedilim</italic> to the word <italic>gedolah</italic> (large).<sup><xref rid="fn1275">50</xref></sup> We believe only in the words of our ancestors.</p>
<p>Scripture mentions this law a second time<sup><xref rid="fn1276">51</xref></sup> in order to add <italic>upon the four corners</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1277">52</xref></sup> The law mandating fringes is connected to the law prohibiting a mixture of linen and wool because the latter does not apply to fringes.</p>
<p>13. IF ANY MAN TAKE A WIFE. According to the deniers<sup><xref rid="fn1278">53</xref></sup> this section was connected to the law of fringes because the latter contain the phrase <italic>wherewith thou coverest thyself</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1279">54</xref></sup> Its true reason can be explained midrashically. The laws are placed one next to the other because first comes the house, next a garment,<sup><xref rid="fn1280">55</xref></sup> and then the mistress of the house.<sup><xref rid="fn1281">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. WANTON. The word <italic>alilot</italic> (wanton) means a cause.<sup><xref rid="fn1282">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>CHARGES. Whether true or false.<sup><xref rid="fn1283">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>VIRGINITY. The word <italic>betulim</italic> (virginity) is a plural. It never comes in the singular. The same applies to <italic>bacharut</italic> (youth), <italic>zekunim</italic> (old age), <italic>alumim</italic> (youth).</p>
<p>15. THE FATHER OF THE DAMSEL, AND HER MOTHER. If they are alive. Otherwise, someone appointed by the court.</p>
<p>19. [HE MAY NOT PUT HER AWAY ALL HIS DAYS.] The meaning of <italic>all his days</italic> is that she shall always be under his care. She shall be so until the day of his death.</p>
<p>21. SHALL STONE HER. Someone most likely slept with her after he betrothed her, for the one who betrothed her would not have done so unless she told him that she was a virgin. The transmitters of the law explained the matter very clearly.<sup><xref rid="fn1284">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>The signs of virginity are found until a fixed time, according to the nature of young ladies.<sup><xref rid="fn1285">60</xref></sup> The law dealing with a married women was connected to the law of the betrothed damsel because Scripture states, <italic>and the men of the city shall stone her</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1286">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>[22. BOTH OF THEM.] The meaning of <italic>gam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1287">62</xref></sup> is this one like the other one. Now Scripture goes on to further elucidate this topic.</p>
<p>23. IF THERE BE. When this thing shall happen.</p>
<p>24. THE GATE. The place where the elders of the city sit. Look, Scripture refers to the betrothed woman as his neighbor&#x2019;s wife. We cannot ascertain the meaning of betrothal except through tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1288">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>[26. UNTO THE DAMSEL&#x2026;DO NOTHING.] She most probably did not agree<sup><xref rid="fn1289">64</xref></sup> and was unaware until he came and raped her. Hence the rapist is compared to a murderer.<sup><xref rid="fn1290">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. CRIED. She most likely cried.</p>
<p>28. THAT IS NOT BETROTHED. Our verse deals with rape, not with seduction.<sup><xref rid="fn1291">66</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1226"><sup>1</sup> The law concerning a lost object was placed in the Torah portion <italic>When Thou Goest Forth to Battle</italic> to teach us that this law applies even in time of war.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1227"><sup>2</sup> This superscription from verse 2 was probably inadvertently misplaced by a copyist because it seems to belong after I.E.&#x2019;s comment&#x2019;s on verse 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1228"><sup>3</sup> If you find the lost animal on your way back from the war.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1229"><sup>4</sup> When you go off to war you ask someone else to bring the animal home.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1230"><sup>5</sup> The meaning of our verse is, thou shalt not see <italic>and hide thyself</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1231"><sup>6</sup> Where Scripture first mentions the law dealing with a lost animal. I.E. was disturbed by the omission of ass in verse 1. Hence his Exodus citation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1232"><sup>7</sup> Literally, you will not be able.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1233"><sup>8</sup> It (<italic>lo tukhal</italic>), like its counterparts, is to be rendered, you are not permitted (thou mayest not). See I.E. on Deut. 17:15; 21:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1234"><sup>9</sup> It applies to all sorts of non-standing positions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1235"><sup>10</sup> You do not have to do the lifting by yourself. You are obligated to help the owner lift the animal. However, this obligation does not apply in instances where the owner stands by and does not assist you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1236"><sup>11</sup> Legitimate children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1237"><sup>12</sup> Women who march off to war with men will have relations with them and produce illegitimate children. I.E. most probably inserted &#x201C;on the way&#x201D; because he wanted to explain why this law follows the previous one. It does so because both deal with something happening on the way. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verse 6 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1238"><sup>13</sup> The purpose of the law is to prevent illicit sexual intercourse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1239"><sup>14</sup> A full beard is not to be taken literally. It means enough facial hair to indicate that the person is a male.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1240"><sup>15</sup> Reading <italic>ve-en yode&#x2019;a</italic>, as in <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. A male dressing as a female has access to women. Rashi has a similar explanation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1241"><sup>16</sup> Of males and females.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1242"><sup>17</sup> The reference is to homosexuality.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1243"><sup>18</sup> Our verse should be taken in accordance with its plain meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1244"><sup>19</sup> Which cross dressing does, for one is then unable to distinguish between male and female.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1245"><sup>20</sup> Verses 6 and 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1246"><sup>21</sup> Both sections thus have a common theme.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1247"><sup>22</sup> The root of <italic>yikkare</italic> and of <italic>nikro nikreti</italic> is <italic>kof, resh, alef</italic>. This root means to call. However, this meaning would be out of place here and in II Sam. 1:6. Hence I.E. points out that our root is a variant of <italic>kof, resh, heh</italic>, which means to meet or to chance upon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1248"><sup>23</sup> There is no such word in Scripture. I.E. probably has Jer. 32:21 in mind. However, the reading there is <italic>u-ve-ezro&#x2019;a</italic>. I.E. probably quoted from memory.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1249"><sup>24</sup> Lev. 22:28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1250"><sup>25</sup> <italic>Ibid</italic>. Lev. 22:28 prohibits the killing of a lamb or an ox and its mother in the same day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1251"><sup>26</sup> The mother bird. God will repay you measure for measure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1252"><sup>27</sup> Verses 8 and 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1253"><sup>28</sup> That is, it is not found again in Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1254"><sup>29</sup> The grammarian reads this as the enclosure of the wicked; i.e., the wicked surround him with trouble.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1255"><sup>30</sup> The roof is enclosed by the fence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1256"><sup>31</sup> By offering an unacceptable interpretation. For <italic>ma&#x2019;akeh</italic> comes from the root <italic>ayin, kof, heh</italic>, and <italic>akat</italic> from <italic>ayin, vav, kof</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1257"><sup>32</sup> Literally, for the one who falls will fall.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1258"><sup>33</sup> Hence Scripture refers to the person who will fall as the one who falls, even though he had not yet fallen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1259"><sup>34</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1260"><sup>35</sup> The naked cannot be stripped. Thus Scripture refers to those who are about to be stripped as stripped.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1261"><sup>36</sup> The reference is to the fetuses that Rebekah was carrying. Scripture refers to them as children because they soon would be so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1262"><sup>37</sup> Scripture speaks of Abraham&#x2019;s pursuit of the Mesopotamian kings who invaded Canaan. Dan, the person after whom the city of Dan was named, was not yet born. Hence the name is used prophetically. See I.E. on Gen. 14:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1263"><sup>38</sup> The Torah relates that the spies sent out by Moses came to a place called the valley of Eshcol. However, it was so named after the spies came there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1264"><sup>39</sup> This was said prophetically by Adam. When Adam made the statement, there were as yet no children or fathers and mothers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1265"><sup>40</sup> The word <italic>kodesh</italic> can also be taken to mean profaned. See Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1266"><sup>41</sup> I.E. does not explain why. He most likely believed that producing a species which God did not create was emulating God&#x2019;s work. The product was thus a godlike creation and holy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1267"><sup>42</sup> <italic>Shatnez</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1268"><sup>43</sup> In verse 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1269"><sup>44</sup> In Lev. 19:19. There, Scripture forbids the wearing of a garment from of a mixture. However, it does not say what sort of mixture is prohibited. It does so here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1270"><sup>45</sup> Those who deny the Rabbinic tradition. The reference is to the Karaites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1271"><sup>46</sup> It is not to be identified with a similar commandment in Num. 15:37-41 requiring the wearing of fringes, for the latter pertains to the day, whereas our verse deals with the night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1272"><sup>47</sup> To indicate that it deals with fringes that are to be worn at night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1273"><sup>48</sup> See <italic>Menachot</italic> 43a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1274"><sup>49</sup> In other words, <italic>gedilim</italic> means twisted threads, for chain-work means twisted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1275"><sup>50</sup> They saw that <italic>gedilim</italic> means large threads.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1276"><sup>51</sup> That is, in addition to mentioning it in Num. 15:37-41, it also mentions it here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1277"><sup>52</sup> Numbers mentions corners, it does not mention four corners.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1278"><sup>53</sup> The Karaites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1279"><sup>54</sup> They take <italic>coverest thyself</italic> (v. 12) to refer to a blanket. Scripture alludes to marriage as placing a covering over a woman. Cf. Ruth 3:9. The allusion is to sharing one blanket.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1280"><sup>55</sup> The reference must be to new garments, for one does not build a house if he does not have a garment to wear.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1281"><sup>56</sup> A wife. A person first builds a house, then buys new garments, and then marries.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1282"><sup>57</sup> I.E. connects <italic>alilot</italic> to the word <italic>illah</italic> (cause). He renders <italic>alilot devarim</italic> as &#x201C;a cause of words.&#x201D; In other words, he states the reason he wants to divorce her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1283"><sup>58</sup> Some commentators interpret <italic>alilot devarim</italic> as false charges. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1284"><sup>59</sup> Witnesses are required to the act of adultery if the damsel is to be executed. She is not executed if she is merely found not to be a virgin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1285"><sup>60</sup> Thus past a certain age the husband cannot claim that his wife was not a virgin. According to the Talmud, the virginity of a girl above the age of 12 1/2 dissipates. See <italic>Yevamot</italic> 59a, &#x201C;And he (the High Priest) shall take a wife in her virginity (Lev. 21:13) excludes one who is a <italic>bogeret</italic> (a female above the age of 12 1/2) for her virginity has ended.&#x201D; I.E. took this statement literally. However, other rabbis interpret this to mean that older women bleed less than those younger than 12 1/2. See <italic>Tosafot, Yevamot</italic> 59a. Also see <italic>Ketuvot</italic> 9a,b and Rashi and <italic>Tosafot</italic> comments there. Also see Maimonides, <italic>Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Ishut</italic> 11:12,13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1286"><sup>61</sup> The same penalty is exacted from a woman living in the house of her husband (v. 24).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1287"><sup>62</sup> The literal meaning of <italic>gam</italic> is also. The literal meaning of <italic>u-metu gam shenehem</italic> (then they shall both of them die) thus is, they shall also die both of them. The word <italic>gam</italic> seems out of place. Hence I.E. renders <italic>gam</italic> as this one like that one. The meaning of <italic>u-metu gam shenehem</italic> thus is, the two of them shall die, this one like that one.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1288"><sup>63</sup> According to the rabbis, betrothal is the first step in marriage. Thus a betrothed damsel is in reality a married woman although she lives in the home of her father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1289"><sup>64</sup> To the sex act.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1290"><sup>65</sup> The rapist, like a murderer, stalks and commits an act of violence upon an unwilling victim.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1291"><sup>66</sup> The parallel law in Ex. 22:15,16 deals with seduction.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 23</title>
<p>1. A MAN SHALL NOT TAKE HIS FATHER&#x2019;S WIFE. The woman whom his father raped.<sup><xref rid="fn1292">1</xref></sup> This section therefore follows.<sup><xref rid="fn1293">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. HE THAT IS CRUSHED.<sup><xref rid="fn1294">3</xref></sup> <italic>Dakkah</italic> (crushed) refers to the testicles.<sup><xref rid="fn1295">4</xref></sup> The word<sup><xref rid="fn1296">5</xref></sup> does not appear again in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1297">6</xref></sup> The grammarians say that it refers to the flesh,<sup><xref rid="fn1298">7</xref></sup> which is soft.<sup><xref rid="fn1299">8</xref></sup> However, this is far-fetched.</p>
<p>PRIVY PARTS. <italic>Shofkhah</italic> (privy parts) refers to the organ from which urine and semen pour.</p>
<p>INTO THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LORD. It means that they shall not be considered as part of God&#x2019;s assembly with regard to taking a daughter of Israel. Similarly, an Ammonite male to the exclusion of an Ammonite female, and a Moabite male to the exclusion of a Moabite female.<sup><xref rid="fn1300">9</xref></sup> Ruth is the true witness to the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn1301">10</xref></sup> The verse that says <italic>neither shall they come among you</italic> (I Kings 11:2)<sup><xref rid="fn1302">11</xref></sup> speaks of the women of the seven nations.<sup><xref rid="fn1303">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, the verse in the Book of Ezra<sup><xref rid="fn1304">13</xref></sup> which states, <italic>that they separated from Israel all the alien mixture</italic> (Neh. 13:3),<sup><xref rid="fn1305">14</xref></sup> refers to the males. I have explained it there.<sup><xref rid="fn1306">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our rabbis, of blessed memory, said that a <italic>mamzer</italic> (bastard) is a child that results from a sexual act which is deemed an <italic>uncovering of the nakedness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1307">16</xref></sup> The two <italic>mems</italic> of <italic>mamzer</italic> are superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1308">17</xref></sup> They are like the <italic>mems</italic> in <italic>mamgurot</italic> (barns) in <italic>the barns are broken down</italic> (Joel 1:17). Others say that <italic>mamzer</italic> is the name of a people. Compare, <italic>And a mamzer shall dwell in Ashdod</italic> (Zech. 9:6), for it is far-fetched for Israel to be given a shameful name.<sup><xref rid="fn1309">18</xref></sup> It is even more unlikely for this to happen in the time of the salvation.<sup><xref rid="fn1310">19</xref></sup> The Aramaic translator of the Bible was brief and midrashic.<sup><xref rid="fn1311">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. BUT THE LORD THY GOD TURNED. For Balaam intended to curse. However, God did not permit him to do so.</p>
<p>10. WHEN THOU GOEST FORTH IN CAMP. The reference is to a camp which goes out to fight the enemy accompanied by the ark. Scripture speaks of a small camp. The Torah does not speak of the great camp,<sup><xref rid="fn1312">21</xref></sup> for this camp had built partitions.<sup><xref rid="fn1313">22</xref></sup> When Israel went to war they were close to and around the ark. It is clear that a person who is unclean because of a nocturnal event<sup><xref rid="fn1314">23</xref></sup> destroys his seed.<sup><xref rid="fn1315">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>This section follows because of the Midianite war, for Scripture mentioned the topic of Balaam.<sup><xref rid="fn1316">25</xref></sup> The Midianites assailed Israel because of the affair of their sister.<sup><xref rid="fn1317">26</xref></sup> The ark was with the camp that went out to fight the Midianites.<sup><xref rid="fn1318">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM EVERY EVIL THING. Spiritually<sup><xref rid="fn1319">28</xref></sup> or physically, such as ejaculations.<sup><xref rid="fn1320">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. CHANCETH. The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>mi-kereh</italic> (chanceth) is a preposition.<sup><xref rid="fn1321">30</xref></sup> <italic>Mi-kereh</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>mi-sedeh</italic> (part of the field) in <italic>part of the field of his possession</italic> (Lev. 27:16).</p>
<p>12. WHEN EVENING COMETH ON. <italic>Li-fenot erev</italic> (when evening cometh) is similar in meaning to <italic>ki fanah ha-yom</italic> (for the day declineth) (Jer. 6:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1322">31</xref></sup> This also strengthens the opinion of the rabbis of blessed memory.<sup><xref rid="fn1323">32</xref></sup> The deniers<sup><xref rid="fn1324">33</xref></sup> say that <italic>li-fenot</italic> (cometh on) means before.<sup><xref rid="fn1325">34</xref></sup> They say nothing of value. Some say<sup><xref rid="fn1326">35</xref></sup> that the meaning of <italic>li-fenot erev</italic> (when evening cometh) is, when the evening begins to come.<sup><xref rid="fn1327">36</xref></sup> Now, after Scripture employs the phrase <italic>li-fenot erev</italic>, it says, <italic>and when the sun is down. Li-fenot erev</italic> thus means before the evening.<sup><xref rid="fn1328">37</xref></sup> <italic>Li-fenot boker</italic> (when the morning appeared) is similarly before sunrise.<sup><xref rid="fn1329">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. A PLACE. The word <italic>yad</italic> means a place.<sup><xref rid="fn1330">39</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>yad ha-yarden</italic> (by the side of the Jordan) (Num. 13:29). This too is proof [that Scripture speaks of a small camp],<sup><xref rid="fn1331">40</xref></sup> for none of the following had to leave the camp of Israel:<sup><xref rid="fn1332">41</xref></sup> one who experienced an ejaculation, one who had to tend to his bodily needs, and certainly no children. Proof of this is the verse which states, <italic>that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is unclean by the dead</italic> (Num. 5:2),<sup><xref rid="fn1333">42</xref></sup> which refers to uncleanliness that is passed on<sup><xref rid="fn1334">43</xref></sup> and not to one who is unclean for a day.<sup><xref rid="fn1335">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. [THY WEAPONS.] The <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>azenekha</italic> (thy weapons) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1336">45</xref></sup> <italic>Azenekha</italic> is related to the word <italic>zonot</italic> (weapons) in <italic>and the weapons washed</italic> (I Kings 22:38).<sup><xref rid="fn1337">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND COVER THAT WHICH COMETH FROM THEE. For all disgusting things which are visible to the eye give birth to a defect in the soul.<sup><xref rid="fn1338">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. NO UNSEEMLY THING. In deed or speech.<sup><xref rid="fn1339">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND TURN AWAY FROM THEE. Its meaning is that God will not go before you, for the latter<sup><xref rid="fn1340">49</xref></sup> is clearly stated.<sup><xref rid="fn1341">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THOU SHALT NOT DELIVER&#x2026;A BONDMAN. It is possible that when Israel goes to war, a non-Israelite bondman escapes into their camp.<sup><xref rid="fn1342">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM HIS MASTER. The master too is not an Israelite. The bondman came for the glory of God, whose name is called over Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1343">52</xref></sup> If the Israelite turns the slave over to his master this will entail the desecration of God&#x2019;s name.<sup><xref rid="fn1344">53</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads, <italic>thou shalt not wrong him</italic>.</p>
<p>18 [THERE SHALL BE NO HARLOT] The law of the <italic>kedeshah</italic> (harlot) follows because the previous section deals with a bondman.<sup><xref rid="fn1345">54</xref></sup> The transmitters of tradition say that the term <italic>kadesh</italic> (sodomite) refers to the one who is slept with.<sup><xref rid="fn1346">55</xref></sup> The phrase <italic>of the sons of Israel</italic> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1347">56</xref></sup> Elihu said, [<italic>Their soul perisheth in youth] And their life as that of the depraved</italic> (kedeshim) (Job 36:14); <italic>their soul</italic> corresponds to <italic>their life</italic> and <italic>kedeshim</italic> corresponds to <italic>in youth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1348">57</xref></sup> Scripture also states, <italic>And there were also sodomites</italic> (kadesh) <italic>in the land</italic> (I Kings 14:24); <italic>the house of the sodomites</italic> (kedeshim) II Kings 23:7). Scripture there continues, <italic>where the women</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1349">58</xref></sup> <italic>wove coverings</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>I do not understand the meaning of the word <italic>kedeshah</italic>. (harlot). When we investigate carefully the meaning of the word we find that it refers to a woman who is known to be prepared to offer herself to all who come and go. <italic>Where is the harlot</italic> (kedeshah) (Gen. 38:21) is proof of this. If this is so,<sup><xref rid="fn1350">59</xref></sup> then the term <italic>kadesh</italic> refers to an Egyptian-like practice.<sup><xref rid="fn1351">60</xref></sup> The intelligent will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn1352">61</xref></sup> The law dealing with a harlot&#x2019;s hire follows because our section deals with a harlot.</p>
<p>19. HIRE. The word <italic>etnan</italic> (hire) is similar to <italic>mattan</italic> (gift).<sup><xref rid="fn1353">62</xref></sup> The <italic>alef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1354">63</xref></sup> is superfluous and the <italic>nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1355">64</xref></sup> is doubled<sup><xref rid="fn1356">65</xref></sup> like the <italic>peh</italic> of <italic>na&#x2019;afufehah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1357">66</xref></sup> (her adulteries) (Hos. 2:4) and like the <italic>resh</italic> of the word <italic>sagrir</italic> (rainy) (Prov. 27:15). <italic>Etnan</italic> refers to what the harlot took, that which those who turn to her give her. [The hire of a harlot shall not be brought to the house of God] because it was given for a prohibited act.</p>
<p>OR THE PRICE OF A DOG. For it is a disrespectful act.<sup><xref rid="fn1358">67</xref></sup> Scripture therefore goes on to say, <italic>for&#x2026;these are an abomination</italic>.</p>
<p>20. THOU SHALT NOT LEND UPON INTEREST TO THY BROTHER. This law is mentioned here because Scripture earlier mentions the non-Jewish bondman (v. 17). Scripture states that even though it is prohibited to wrong the latter,<sup><xref rid="fn1359">68</xref></sup> it is permitted to take interest from him.</p>
<p>THOU SHALT NOT LEND UPON INTEREST TO THY BROTHER. There is a difference between <italic>tishokh</italic> (you shall take interest)<sup><xref rid="fn1360">69</xref></sup> and <italic>tashikh</italic> (Thou shalt lend upon interest).<sup><xref rid="fn1361">70</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>lo tashikh</italic> (Thou shalt not lend upon interest) is, you shall not accept interest from your brother when he offers it;<sup><xref rid="fn1362">71</xref></sup> your brother also violates the law regarding interest.<sup><xref rid="fn1363">72</xref></sup> Notice, <italic>tashikh</italic> is a word governing two acts.<sup><xref rid="fn1364">73</xref></sup> Many say that <italic>tashikh</italic> is similar to <italic>tishokh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1365">74</xref></sup> There is no difference between them. There are many such verbs in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1366">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. WHEN THOU SHALT VOW A VOW. This law follows because Scripture mentioned <italic>for any vow</italic> when it spoke of <italic>the hire of a harlot</italic> (v. 19).</p>
<p>FOR THE LORD THY GOD WILL SURELY REQUIRE IT. This is a metaphoric statement. God will act like a person.<sup><xref rid="fn1367">76</xref></sup> He will demand what you vowed.</p>
<p>AND IT WILL BE SIN IN THEE. <italic>Chet</italic> (sin) means punishment.<sup><xref rid="fn1368">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. THAT WHICH IS GONE OUT OF THY LIPS. Regarding anything where God&#x2019;s name is mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1369">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>FREELY.<sup><xref rid="fn1370">79</xref></sup> For every vow offering<sup><xref rid="fn1371">80</xref></sup> is a free-will offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1372">81</xref></sup> However, not every free-will offering is a vow offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1373">82</xref></sup> The aforementioned is clear.<sup><xref rid="fn1374">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHICH THOU HAST PROMISED WITH THY MOUTH. After the vow has come out of your mouth you cannot take it back.</p>
<p>25. WHEN THOU COMEST INTO THY NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S VINEYARD. To harvest grapes<sup><xref rid="fn1375">84</xref></sup> then you are permitted to eat of them. This section follows to indicate that you are obligated to set aside from your own when taking a vow, but you must not take to yourself that which belongs to another.<sup><xref rid="fn1376">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THY VESSEL. The word <italic>kelyekha</italic> (thy vessel) is similar to the word <italic>edyekha</italic> (thy ornaments) (Ex. 33:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1377">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. WHEN THOU COMEST INTO THY NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S STANDING CORN. To harvest.<sup><xref rid="fn1378">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEN THOU MAYEST PLUCK. The word <italic>ve-katafta</italic> (then thou mayest pluck) is similar to the word <italic>ha-kotefim</italic> (they pluck) in <italic>They pluck salt-wort</italic> (Job 30:4).</p>
<p>EARS. The meaning of <italic>melilot</italic> (ears) is known from its context.</p>
<p>A SICKLE. <italic>Chermesh</italic> (sickle) is a quadriliteral.<sup><xref rid="fn1379">88</xref></sup> The deniers<sup><xref rid="fn1380">89</xref></sup> say that this law applies to those who pass by the field,<sup><xref rid="fn1381">90</xref></sup> for Scripture says, <italic>thou shalt not move a sickle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1382">91</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1292"><sup>1</sup> This is the opinion of Rabbi Judah in the Talmud. However, the <italic>halakhah</italic> is not in keeping with this ruling. See <italic>Yevamot</italic> 97a.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1294"><sup>3</sup> Hebrew, <italic>petzu&#x2019;a dakkah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1295"><sup>4</sup> I.E. renders <italic>petzu&#x2019;a dakkah</italic> as one who is wounded (<italic>petzu&#x2019;a</italic>) in the testicles (<italic>dakkah</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1296"><sup>5</sup> <italic>Dakkah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1297"><sup>6</sup> With the meaning of testicle. We have followed the reading of <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38, which says, <italic>betzim belo chaver</italic>. The <italic>Mikra&#x2019;ot Gedolot</italic> edition of I.E. reads: <italic>betzim belo ever</italic> (testicles without a penis). This reading appears wrong in view of the fact that Scripture goes on to say that one missing a penis shall not enter the congregation of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1298"><sup>7</sup> The flesh of the testicles, literally their flesh.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1299"><sup>8</sup> The word <italic>dakkah</italic> (testicles) means soft. The grammarians explain that the testicles are referred to by the term <italic>dakkah</italic> because the flesh of the testicles is soft.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1300"><sup>9</sup> Similarly when Scripture states that an Ammonite and a Moabite may not enter the congregation of the Lord (v. 4), it means that they are not permitted to marry an Israelite woman.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1301"><sup>10</sup> That the law prohibiting a Moabite from coming into the congregation of the Lord is limited to males, for Ruth was a Moabitess and she was permitted to marry an Israelite. The same rule would apply to the Ammonites, for the prohibition of marriage between Ammonites or Moabites and Israelites is stated in the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1302"><sup>11</sup> The verse speaks of the women whom Solomon took. Scripture mentions Moabites, Ammonites, Zidonians, and the Hittites (I Kings 11:2). <italic>Prima facie</italic>, Ammonite and Moabite women fall under Scripture&#x2019;s marriage ban.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1303"><sup>12</sup> The seven Canaanite nations. In other words, <italic>neither shall they come among you</italic> refers to the Zidonians and Hittites, who were Canaanites, and not to the Moabites and the Ammonites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1304"><sup>13</sup> I.E. refers to both Ezra and Nehemiah as the Book of Ezra.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1305"><sup>14</sup> The verse speaks of Ammonites and Moabites. See Neh. 13:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1306"><sup>15</sup> Our editions of I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Nehemiah do not have this explanation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1307"><sup>16</sup> A sexual act involving people who cannot marry each other, e.g., as in incest or adultery.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1308"><sup>17</sup> For <italic>mamzer</italic> is a variant of <italic>zar</italic>, (a stranger). A <italic>mamzer</italic> is a child born to people who must remain strangers to each other with regard to sexual relations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1309"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Mamzer</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1310"><sup>19</sup> Zechariah speaks of the messianic era. If <italic>mamzer</italic> refers to Israel then the prophet is saying that the bastards (Israel) shall dwell in Ashdod when the messiah comes. Therefore what the prophet says is that in the messianic era a nation called <italic>mamzer</italic> will dwell in Ashdod.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1311"><sup>20</sup> <italic>Targum Jonathan</italic> to Zech. 9:6 renders <italic>And a mamzer shall dwell in Ashdod</italic>, and the children of Israel shall dwell in Ashdod where they were strangers. Thus the <italic>Targum</italic> renders <italic>mamzer</italic> in Zechariah as strangers. <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 says, the Aramaic translator of the Bible interpreted it midrashically. The latter reading appears correct, for the <italic>Targum</italic> elaborates on the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1312"><sup>21</sup> The camp which comprised the entire Israelite nation.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1322"><sup>31</sup> The verse continues, <italic>For the shadows of the evening are stretched out</italic>. In other words, <italic>li-fenot erev</italic> means when the day declines, when the shadows of evening come. According to Krinsky and others the reference is to the afternoon when the sun begins its decline. Filwarg believes the reference is to about an hour and a third before the onset of night. See I.E. on Gen. 1:18 (Vol. 1, p. 40). &#x201C;Know that evening begins at sunset and lasts for one and a third hours, during which time a light-like appearance is seen before sunrise.&#x201D; Also see Rashi: &#x201C;He should immerse himself close before the setting of the sun&#x201D; (Rosenbaun and Silberman translation).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1327"><sup>36</sup> That is, when night begins, for they believe that evening is identical with night.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1335"><sup>44</sup> Who does not render unclean a person whom he touches.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1336"><sup>45</sup> <italic>Zayin</italic> is a weapon. <italic>Azenekha</italic> is a variant of <italic>zaynekha</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1346"><sup>55</sup> The one who takes the passive position in male homosexual intercourse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1347"><sup>56</sup> That the reference is to the passive partner in male homosexuality, for the term &#x201C;of&#x201D; implies passivity. Otherwise Scripture would have used the term &#x201C;among&#x201D; (Krinsky, Meijler). I.E.&#x2019;s point is that &#x201C;of&#x201D; means belonging to. Hence within the context of our verse it alludes to the docile sex partner.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1349"><sup>58</sup> I.E. takes this reference to be to prostitutes (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1350"><sup>59</sup> If the term <italic>kedeshah</italic> refers to a female engaged in heterosexual intercourse, then so must the term <italic>kadesh</italic>, for <italic>kadesh</italic> is the masculine form of the noun.</ftnote>

<p>FREE. <italic>Naki</italic> (free) is similar to <italic>naki</italic> (innocent)<sup><xref rid="fn1395">13</xref></sup> in <italic>him that is innocent</italic> (Job 22:30).</p>
<p>[WITH ANY BUSINESS.] The <italic>lamed</italic> placed before <italic>le-khol davar</italic> (with any business) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1396">14</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>lamed</italic> in <italic>le-avshalom</italic> (Absalom) in <italic>the third, Absalom</italic> (I Chron. 3:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1397">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. NO MAN SHALL TAKE THE MILL OR THE UPPER MILLSTONE TO PLEDGE. The deniers<sup><xref rid="fn1398">16</xref></sup> say that this section is connected to <italic>and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken</italic> (v. 5),<sup><xref rid="fn1399">17</xref></sup> for our verse alludes to coitus, namely, that it is forbidden to abstain from sexual intercourse. However, this is sheer nonsense. They offer as proof, <italic>Then let my wife grind unto another</italic> (Job 31:10). I have previously explained the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn1400">18</xref></sup> The truth is that our verse is to be taken at face value,<sup><xref rid="fn1401">19</xref></sup> that a person is prohibited from taking a mill to pledge. The word <italic>chovel</italic> (one who takes a pledge) is missing from our verse.<sup><xref rid="fn1402">20</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>and he said to Joseph</italic> (Gen. 48:1) and to <italic>whom she bore to Levi</italic> (Num. 26:29), for the meaning of the former is, someone said to Joseph, and of the latter, the one who bore, bore to Levi.<sup><xref rid="fn1403">21</xref></sup> There are many such cases.<sup><xref rid="fn1404">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE MILL. The word <italic>rechayim</italic> (mill) is in the dual form. It does not come in the singular.</p>
<p>THE UPPER MILLSTONE. <italic>Rechev</italic> (upper millstone) refers to a water mill. Others say that it refers to the wood which is placed on the mill.<sup><xref rid="fn1405">23</xref></sup> Still others say that the <italic>rechayim</italic> (mill) refers to the lower millstone and <italic>rechev</italic> to the upper millstone.</p>
<p>FOR HE TAKETH A MAN&#x2019;S LIFE TO PLEDGE. For life is sustained by these instruments.</p>
<p>Those who rely on the juxtaposition of the sections have no argument,<sup><xref rid="fn1406">24</xref></sup> for each commandment stands by itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1407">25</xref></sup> The explanation of their juxtapositions is midrashic.<sup><xref rid="fn1408">26</xref></sup> This section<sup><xref rid="fn1409">27</xref></sup> is connected to the previous ones in the following way:<sup><xref rid="fn1410">28</xref></sup> the Torah mentions that one is not to steal grapes by putting them in his pots (Deut. 23:25), or to lift up a sickle upon his neighbor&#x2019;s grain (Deut. 23:26); or to take a woman after she has been his and then left his house and married another (v. 1). It also states that one has to cheer the woman whom he marries (v. 5); he is not to be oppressed by going into the army (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). The taking of a millstone in pledge is a form of oppression.<sup><xref rid="fn1411">29</xref></sup> So too is kidnapping a person. Similarly the plague of leprosy, for if he does not observe its laws then the plague will injure those in proximity to it.<sup><xref rid="fn1412">30</xref></sup> Scripture similarly states, do not oppress a poor person by taking a pledge from him (v. 10). It similarly states do not oppress a hired person (v. 14) and small children should not be put to death for the sins of the fathers (v. 16). It likewise warns against perverting the justice due a stranger or the fatherless (v. 17). It prohibits the taking of a widow&#x2019;s garment as a pledge (v. 17). It prohibits one from retrieving a sheaf which was forgotten in the field, for it belongs to the poor (v. 19). Similarly <italic>Thou shalt not glean</italic> (v. 21). Likewise <italic>lest if he should exceed&#x2026;Then thy brother should be dishonored</italic> (Deut. 25:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1413">31</xref></sup> The muzzling of an ox (v. 4) is an act of oppression, for the animal toils but cannot eat of its toil. Similarly, refusing to perform levirate marriage (Deut. 25:5-10) is a form of oppression. The woman who grabs a man&#x2019;s testicles (Deut. 25:11) commits an act of oppression. Employing diverse weights and diverse measures (Deut. 25:13,14) is oppression in its purest form. Furthermore, Amalek oppressed Israel (Deut. 25:17-19).<sup><xref rid="fn1414">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. ANY OF HIS BRETHREN. Scripture adds <italic>of the children of Israel</italic> because the Edomites are called brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn1415">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE DEAL WITH HIM AS A SLAVE. The word <italic>vehitammer</italic> (and he deal with him as a slave) is to be explained as its counterpart.<sup><xref rid="fn1416">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES. The <italic>kohanim</italic> who are members of the tribe of Levi.<sup><xref rid="fn1417">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. UNTO MIRIAM. Here is proof of the midrashic statement that we should not read the word <italic>metzora</italic> as <italic>metzora</italic> (a leper) but as an acronym for <italic>motzi shem ra</italic> (one who invents libel).<sup><xref rid="fn1418">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. DOST LEND. The word <italic>tasheh</italic> (thou&#x2026;dost lend) comes from the root <italic>nun, shin, heh</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>heh</italic> of the word <italic>me&#x2019;umah</italic> (any manner of loan) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1419">37</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>laylah</italic> (night).<sup><xref rid="fn1420">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO FETCH. To take his pledge.<sup><xref rid="fn1421">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND IT SHALL BE RIGHTEOUSNESS<sup><xref rid="fn1422">40</xref></sup> UNTO THEE. You shall weigh your neighbor in the righteous scales<sup><xref rid="fn1423">41</xref></sup> which you possess<sup><xref rid="fn1424">42</xref></sup> so that he sleeps with his pledge.<sup><xref rid="fn1425">43</xref></sup> According to the transmitters of tradition there are places wherein there is a difference between the word <italic>tzedek</italic> (righteousness) and <italic>tzedakah</italic> (righteousness).<sup><xref rid="fn1426">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE PLEDGE.] I have previously explained the meaning of the pledge<sup><xref rid="fn1427">45</xref></sup> in the Torah portion <italic>Now These Are the Ordinances</italic> (Ex 21:1) in my comments on &#x201C;his garment&#x201D; (Ex. 22:26).<sup><xref rid="fn1428">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. IN THE SAME DAY THOU SHALT GIVE HIM HIS HIRE, NEITHER SHALL THE SUN GO DOWN UPON IT. A negative commandment follows the positive commandment for emphasis.</p>
<p>UPON IT. His wages</p>
<p>SETTETH HIS HEART. To sustain himself from it. He therefore hired himself out.</p>
<p>16. [THE FATHERS SHALL NOT BE PUT TO DEATH.] Those whose spirits wander ask: &#x201C;How could Scripture say: <italic>The fathers shall not he put to death&#x2026;</italic>when it says in another place, <italic>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children</italic> (Ex. 20:5; Deut. 5:9)?&#x201D; Their question is nonsense, for <italic>the fathers shall not he put to death for the children</italic> is a commandment directed to Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1429">47</xref></sup> However, God is the one who metes out punishment in <italic>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children</italic>. I have earlier explained this in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn1430">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. BUT THOU SHALT REMEMBER. Scripture mentioned the stranger<sup><xref rid="fn1431">49</xref></sup> for this reason,<sup><xref rid="fn1432">50</xref></sup> namely, that you do not pervert the justice due him. Moses previously mentioned some of the laws to the fathers.<sup><xref rid="fn1433">51</xref></sup> He also repeated them to the children.<sup><xref rid="fn1434">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THAT THE LORD&#x2026;MAY BLESS THEE. For you gave<sup><xref rid="fn1435">53</xref></sup> what you thought was yours<sup><xref rid="fn1436">54</xref></sup> but God will give you what is truthfully His.<sup><xref rid="fn1437">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. WHEN THOU BEATEST. <italic>Tachbot</italic> (thou beatist) is similar to <italic>chovet</italic> (beating) in <italic>beating out wheat</italic> (Jud. 6:11). It is in the <italic>pa&#x2019;al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1438">56</xref></sup> The word <italic>yechavet</italic> (is beaten) in <italic>But the black cummin is beaten</italic> (Is. 28:27) is a <italic>nifal</italic>. All letters whose first root letter is an <italic>alef, chet, heh, ayin</italic>, or <italic>resh</italic> are vocalized like <italic>yechavet</italic> when conjugated in the <italic>nifal</italic>. The following are examples of each one of the aforementioned: <italic>ye&#x2019;atzer</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1439">57</xref></sup> (treasured) and <italic>yechasen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1440">58</xref></sup> (laid up) in <italic>it shall not be treasured nor laid up</italic> (Is. 23:18); <italic>yehareg</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1441">59</xref></sup> (killed) as in <italic>ve-lo yehareg</italic> (and will not be killed); <italic>ye&#x2019;aved</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1442">60</xref></sup> (plowed) in <italic>neither be plowed</italic> (Deut. 21:4); <italic>yera&#x2019;eh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1443">61</xref></sup> (appear) in <italic>and they shall not appear</italic> (Deut,. 16:16), for this is the rule.<sup><xref rid="fn1444">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. THOU SHALT NOT GO OVER THE BOUGHS AGAIN. <italic>Lo tefa&#x2019;er</italic> (Thou shalt not go over the boughs) means you shall not seek after its &#x201C;glory,&#x201D; that is, after its branches. Compare, <italic>pore&#x2019;ot</italic> (sprigs) in <italic>And shot forth sprigs</italic> (Ezek. 17:6). It too<sup><xref rid="fn1445">63</xref></sup> is spelled with an <italic>alef</italic> even though it is read as if written with a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1446">64</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>nodot</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1447">65</xref></sup> (wineskins) in <italic>and wineskins, worn</italic> (Josh. 9:4).</p>
<p>22. AND THOU SHALT REMEMBER. This<sup><xref rid="fn1448">66</xref></sup> is connected to <italic>for the stranger</italic> (v. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn1449">67</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1383"><sup>1</sup> Hebrew, <italic>kesherah</italic>. However, she is disliked by her husband. I.E. takes issue with Beth Shamai, which interprets <italic>some unseemly thing</italic> as a sexual transgression. See <italic>Mishnah, Gitten</italic> 9:10. Other editions read, she is also considered as a field (<italic>ke-sadeh</italic>). A woman, like a field, is acquired by a money transaction. See <italic>Kedushin</italic> 2a. Hence the law regarding a woman follows that of the field. Filwarg believes that I.E. compares a woman to a field in that both are seeded and produce fruit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1384"><sup>2</sup> The reason that she did not find favor in her husband&#x2019;s eyes was not due to a moral imperfection.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1385"><sup>3</sup> Hebrew, <italic>u-matza</italic>. I.E.&#x2019;s reading is <italic>And he had found</italic>. The problem is that the verse reads <italic>ki matza</italic> (because he has found). Weiser suggests that <italic>u-matza</italic> is I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of <italic>ki matza</italic>. However, I.E. goes on to prove that the <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to a word sometimes has the meaning of &#x201C;or.&#x201D; It is a bit farfetched to say that I.E. intends to say that <italic>ki matza</italic> should be interpreted as <italic>u-matza</italic>, and that <italic>u-matza</italic> should be interpreted as <italic>or has found</italic>, because a <italic>vav</italic> sometimes has the meaning of or. It thus appears either that I.E.&#x2019;s copy of Deuteronomy had <italic>u-matza</italic> or that I.E. quoted from memory and committed an egregious error.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1386"><sup>4</sup> The moral imperfection found in her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1387"><sup>5</sup> To the immoral act that he accuses her of.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1390"><sup>8</sup> Which should have followed the <italic>heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1391"><sup>9</sup> It too is a <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic> with the <italic>tav</italic> of the form omitted. The latter is compensated by placing a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>caf</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1392"><sup>10</sup> In other words, new means a woman who was never married.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1393"><sup>11</sup> Even a widow or divorcee.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1394"><sup>12</sup> He shall not be conscripted into doing any of the king&#x2019;s service.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1395"><sup>13</sup> That is, free from guilt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1396"><sup>14</sup> <italic>Le-khol davar</italic> should be read <italic>kol davar. Le-khol davar</italic> literally means to any business. <italic>Khol davar</italic> means any business.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1397"><sup>15</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ha-shelishi le-avshalom</italic>. Literally, the third, to Absalom. However, the context does not permit this interpretation. Hence the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>le-avshalom</italic> is superfluous, and <italic>le-avshalom</italic> is to be read as if written <italic>avshalom</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1398"><sup>16</sup> The Karaites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1399"><sup>17</sup> The reference is to the Karaite Bible commentator Levi ben Yefet. According to Levi ben Yefet the meaning of our clause is that a man (the upper millstone) or a woman (the mill) shall not abstain from sexual relations with each other. The Hebrew word for take to pledge is <italic>lo yachavol</italic>. This can be rendered, he shall not harm (Krinsky). Thus the meaning of our verse is, one shall not harm his partner by refraining from taking the upper position (the upper millstone) or the lower position (the mill).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1400"><sup>18</sup> That intercourse is metaphorically described by the term &#x201C;grinding.&#x201D; See I.E. on Job 31:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1401"><sup>19</sup> Despite the fact that &#x201C;grind&#x201D; is used as a metaphor for sexual intercourse in Job.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1402"><sup>20</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>lo yachavol rechayim va-rechev</italic>. This literally means he shall not take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge. The question is: To whom does &#x201C;he&#x201D; refer? Hence I.E. points out that the word <italic>chovel</italic> (anyone that takes a pledge) has been omitted. Our verse should be read as if written, <italic>lo yachavol chovel rechayim va-rechev</italic> (any one that takes a pledge shall not take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1403"><sup>21</sup> See I.E. Gen. 48:1 (Vol. 1, p. 412).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1404"><sup>22</sup> Where Scripture omits the subject.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1405"><sup>23</sup> The reference is probably to a wooden handle which was used to turn the upper stone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1406"><sup>24</sup> That our verse speaks metaphorically of sexual intercourse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1407"><sup>25</sup> The commandments are not necessarily tied together. Each commandment is an independent unit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1408"><sup>26</sup> It therefore cannot be used as a reason to interpret a law metaphorically when the plain meaning of the text is acceptable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1409"><sup>27</sup> The law regarding taking a mill to pledge.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1410"><sup>28</sup> That is, if we want to connect this section midrashically to what comes before, we can so in the following manner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1411"><sup>29</sup> Hence the positioning of our law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1412"><sup>30</sup> By infecting them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1413"><sup>31</sup> Deut. 25:3 prohibits the infliction of more that 40 stripes to one being punished by lashes. Exceeding this number of stripes is a form of oppression.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1414"><sup>32</sup> Thus the laws in Deut. 23:25-25:19 are thematically related. Hence the law prohibiting the taking of a mill was included in this section.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1415"><sup>33</sup> In other words, brethren in our verse applies only to an Israelite. Edom is referred to as Israel&#x2019;s brother in verse 34.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1416"><sup>34</sup> <italic>Titammer</italic> (deal with&#x2026;as a slave) in Deut. 21:14. I.E. there explains it to mean treacherously.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1417"><sup>35</sup> See I.E. on Deut. 10:7,8; 17:9, and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1418"><sup>36</sup> See <italic>Tanchumah</italic> on the Torah portion <italic>Metzora</italic> 2. According to the rabbis, leprosy is a punishment for speaking ill of one&#x2019;s neighbor. Miriam was punished with leprosy for speaking ill of Moses (see Num. 12). According to I.E., Scripture&#x2019;s telling us that we are to recall Miriam&#x2019;s punishment is another way of saying, remember the punishment for speaking ill of your neighbor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1419"><sup>37</sup> The basic word is <italic>me&#x2019;um</italic>. Compare, Job 31:7; Dan. 1:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1420"><sup>38</sup> The basic word is <italic>layil</italic>. Compare, Is. 16:3. See I.E. on Gen. 1:5 (Vol. 1, p. 33).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1421"><sup>39</sup> The verse reads, <italic>la&#x2019;avot avoto</italic>. I.E. notes that the verb <italic>la&#x2019;avot</italic> means to take a pledge. In other words, Scripture uses a verb which is derived from a noun. Compare, <italic>tadshe ha-aretz deshe</italic> (let the earth put forth grass) (Gen. 1:11).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1422"><sup>40</sup> Hebrew, <italic>tzedakah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1423"><sup>41</sup> Righteous scales is I.E.&#x2019;s metaphor for one&#x2019;s sense of acting righteously and mercifully.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1424"><sup>42</sup> In other words, <italic>and it shall be righteousness unto thee</italic> means and you shall act righteously.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1425"><sup>43</sup> That is, you permit him to sleep in his garment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1426"><sup>44</sup> According to the rabbis, <italic>tzedek</italic> means righteousness and <italic>tzedakah</italic> charity.

<p>[3. THEN THY BROTHER SHOULD BE DISHONORED.] For the thing<sup><xref rid="fn1464">15</xref></sup> is well known. It is a decree from the Almighty that the sufferer suffer forty blows. This is a decree from heaven so that the number of blows not depend on the will of the judge.</p>
<p>4. [WHEN HE TREADETH.] The deniers<sup><xref rid="fn1465">16</xref></sup> say that the <italic>bet</italic> in <italic>be-disho</italic> (when he treadeth down) indicates prior to treading.<sup><xref rid="fn1466">17</xref></sup> However, this is unnecessary.<sup><xref rid="fn1467">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. IF BRETHREN<sup><xref rid="fn1468">19</xref></sup> DWELL TOGETHER. The deniers also say that these brethren<sup><xref rid="fn1469">20</xref></sup> are not actual brothers,<sup><xref rid="fn1470">21</xref></sup> but are relatives. They brought proof from Boaz.<sup><xref rid="fn1471">22</xref></sup> However, they contribute nothing, for there is no mention of levirate marriage,<sup><xref rid="fn1472">23</xref></sup> only of redemption.<sup><xref rid="fn1473">24</xref></sup> Why mention the word <italic>together</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn1474">25</xref></sup> Does it matter if they were in one state or in one courtyard, or if they loved each other?<sup><xref rid="fn1475">26</xref></sup> They say,<sup><xref rid="fn1476">27</xref></sup> look, the verse says <italic>ve-yibbemah</italic> (and shall perform the duty of a husband&#x2019;s brother unto her).<sup><xref rid="fn1477">28</xref></sup> This shows that he is her brother-in-law in name only.<sup><xref rid="fn1478">29</xref></sup> It is like <italic>thy sister-in-law</italic> (yevimtekh)<sup><xref rid="fn1479">30</xref></sup> <italic>is gone back</italic> (Ruth 1:15). Now observe that they have become foolish and stupid, for Scripture states, with regard to the sons of Judah, <italic>and perform the duty of a husband&#x2019;s brother</italic> (ve-yabbem) <italic>unto her</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1480">31</xref></sup> (Gen. 38:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1481">32</xref></sup> Now he<sup><xref rid="fn1482">33</xref></sup> was her<sup><xref rid="fn1483">34</xref></sup> brother-in-law.<sup><xref rid="fn1484">35</xref></sup> Also, the term <italic>yevimtekh</italic> (thy sister-in-law) (Ruth 1:15) was used because they were married to two brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn1485">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>All intelligent people know that the negative commandments given to Moses<sup><xref rid="fn1486">37</xref></sup> were not previously prohibited.<sup><xref rid="fn1487">38</xref></sup> However, it would not have been evil in the eyes of God if someone abstained from them<sup><xref rid="fn1488">39</xref></sup> before the law was given to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1489">40</xref></sup> The fact that Scripture states, <italic>for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you</italic> (Lev. 18:27), shows that this is certainly the case. We do not find a prophet who warned them.<sup><xref rid="fn1490">41</xref></sup> Look, Scripture says of Onan, who did not give seed to his brother, <italic>the thing which he did was evil in the sight of God</italic> (Gen. 38:10).<sup><xref rid="fn1491">42</xref></sup> We will therefore rely on the tradition that they are actual brothers.</p>
<p>AND HAVE NO CHILD. For if the deceased has a son, there is no need for him<sup><xref rid="fn1492">43</xref></sup> to take his brother&#x2019;s wife, for she is forbidden to him.</p>
<p>The word <italic>yachdav</italic> (together) is to be understood in accordance with the explanation of the transmitters of tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1493">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>ONE NOT OF HIS KIN. This explains the term <italic>ha-chutzah</italic> (abroad).<sup><xref rid="fn1494">45</xref></sup> This law applies only if the brother-in-law intends to marry her.<sup><xref rid="fn1495">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. THE FIRST-BORN THAT SHE BEARETH. Will be called by the name of his<sup><xref rid="fn1496">47</xref></sup> brother.</p>
<p>THAT HIS NAME BE NOT BLOTTED OUT. Scripture speaks of his inheritance.<sup><xref rid="fn1497">48</xref></sup> I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>that she beareth</italic> in my comments on <italic>unto a foreign people</italic> (Ex. 21:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1498">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. MY HUSBAND&#x2019;S BROTHER. The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>yevami</italic> (my husband&#x2019;s brother) is in fact the sign of the object.<sup><xref rid="fn1499">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND IF HE STAND, AND SAY. Until the elders hear.<sup><xref rid="fn1500">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND LOOSE. <italic>Ve-chaletzah</italic> (and loose) is similar to <italic>chaletzu</italic> (draw out) in <italic>draw out the breast</italic> (Lam. 3:4). Its meaning is to remove.</p>
<p>IN HIS FACE. The transmitters of tradition explain that the word <italic>be-fanav</italic> (in his face) has the meaning of before his face.<sup><xref rid="fn1501">52</xref></sup> According to its plain meaning, <italic>be-fanav</italic> means before the shoe, for <italic>panav</italic> here is similar to <italic>panim</italic> (in front) in <italic>front and on the back</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1502">53</xref></sup> (Ezek. 2:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1503">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. WHEN MEN STRIVE. The reverse of <italic>If brethren dwell together</italic> (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn1504">55</xref></sup> The men spoken of are strangers or brothers.</p>
<p>BY THE SECRETS. <italic>Mevushav</italic> (the secrets) means his testicles. It is related to the word <italic>bushah</italic> (shame).<sup><xref rid="fn1505">56</xref></sup> It is an act of audacity to uncover that which is hidden, namely, a person&#x2019;s nakedness. It is also a vital organ.<sup><xref rid="fn1506">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THEN THOU SHALT CUT OFF HER HAND. If she does not pay ransom money. Its meaning is similar to <italic>eye for eye</italic> (Ex. 21:24).<sup><xref rid="fn1507">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>THINE EYE SHALL HAVE NO PITY. If she be poor.<sup><xref rid="fn1508">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. IN THY BAG.<sup><xref rid="fn1509">60</xref></sup> Where you place the scales.<sup><xref rid="fn1510">61</xref></sup> Or, do not deceitfully take the weights from the bag.<sup><xref rid="fn1511">62</xref></sup> The first interpretation is correct. The proof text is, <italic>Let us all have one hag</italic> (kis)<sup><xref rid="fn1512">63</xref></sup> (Prov. 1:14), the meaning of which is, one scale.<sup><xref rid="fn1513">64</xref></sup> The word <italic>kis</italic> (bag) is related to the word <italic>tachossu</italic> (ye shall make your count)<sup><xref rid="fn1514">65</xref></sup> in <italic>ye shall make your count for the lamb</italic> (Ex. 12:4) even though <italic>tachossu</italic> comes from a different root.<sup><xref rid="fn1515">66</xref></sup> Many explained the word <italic>kis</italic> to mean a pouch.<sup><xref rid="fn1516">67</xref></sup> There is no need for this interpretation.</p>
<p>15. PERFECT. No part shall be missing.<sup><xref rid="fn1517">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>[JUST MEASURE.] A just measure means a measure which conforms to the market measure.<sup><xref rid="fn1518">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT THY DAYS MAY BE LONG. For it is well known that all righteous kingdoms will endure, for righteousness is like a building. However, unrighteousness<sup><xref rid="fn1519">70</xref></sup> is like a ruin. Its wall collapses in a moment</p>
<p>16. FOR ALL THAT DO SUCH THINGS. Those who possess diverse measures and diverse weights. This is followed by a general rule, namely, <italic>even all that do unrighteously</italic> verbally and by deed, secretly or publicly.</p>
<p>18. HOW HE MET THEE. <italic>Karekha</italic> (met thee) is related to the word <italic>korot</italic> (befallen) in <italic>all that had befallen them</italic> (Gen. 42:29).</p>
<p>AND SMOTE THE HINDMOST OF THEE. <italic>Va-yezanev bekhah</italic> (and smote the hindmost of thee) means,<sup><xref rid="fn1520">71</xref></sup> and cut off your tail (<italic>zanav</italic>), namely, <italic>all that were enfeebled in thy rear</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1521">72</xref></sup> that is, those who did not have the strength to walk. It is possible that the word <italic>necheshalim</italic> (enfeebled)<sup><xref rid="fn1522">73</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>nechelashim</italic> (enfeebled).<sup><xref rid="fn1523">74</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>keves</italic> (lamb) and <italic>kesev</italic> (lamb).<sup><xref rid="fn1524">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHEN THOU WAS FAINT. For Amalek came to Rephidim where the people thirsted for water. The latter is clearly stated.<sup><xref rid="fn1525">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WEARY. From the way.</p>
<p>AND HE FEARED NOT. This refers to Amalek. <italic>Yare</italic> (feared) is a verb in the perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn1526">77</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>kaved</italic> (heavy) in <italic>for the thing is too heavy for thee</italic> (Ex. 18:8); <italic>zaken</italic> (old) in <italic>that when Isaac was old</italic> (Gen. 27:1), and <italic>ahev</italic> (loveth) in <italic>such as he loveth</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>, 8).<sup><xref rid="fn1527">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. WHEN THE LORD THY GOD HATH GIVEN THEE REST. It means that this commandment takes effect after Israel inherits the land and the land is quiet from all the wars with the surrounding nations, for as long as they are involved in waging war with the nations close to them they are not obligated to fight Amalek.</p>
<p>THAT THOU SHALT BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE. Namely, <italic>slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass</italic> (I Sam 15:3), so that no one says this ox is from the spoil taken from Amalek. The words of the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn1528">79</xref></sup> are a general statement. The words of the prophet Samuel<sup><xref rid="fn1529">80</xref></sup> go into detail.</p>
<p>THOU SHALT NOT FORGET. Scripture says this after having already stated <italic>Remember&#x2026;</italic>(v. 17) for emphasis. The same is true with many other commandments in the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1530">81</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1450"><sup>1</sup> <italic>U-shefatum</italic> literally means and they will judge them. The subject is omitted. Our verse literally reads, <italic>if there be a controversy between men and they go unto judgment, and they judge them</italic> (u-shefatum). Hence I.E. explains that &#x201C;and they judge them&#x201D; is short for: and the judges judge them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1451"><sup>2</sup> Here too the subject is omitted, for the verse literally reads, He shall not take the mill to pledge. See I.E. on Deut. 24:6 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1452"><sup>3</sup> It is usually vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic>, i.e., <italic>ben</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1453"><sup>4</sup> The word <italic>ben</italic> usually means son of. However, in <italic>bin hakkot</italic> and <italic>ben bliyya&#x2019;al, ben</italic> signifies that the subject belongs to a certain group.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1454"><sup>5</sup> <italic>Bin hakkot</italic> means that the wicked falls into the category of those whom the judge is obligated to have beaten.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1455"><sup>6</sup> Hebrew, <italic>rasha</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1456"><sup>7</sup> The judge shall ask officers of the court to place him in a prone position.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1459"><sup>10</sup> Regardless of the sin committed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1460"><sup>11</sup> That all those who are punished by flogging receive 39 lashes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1461"><sup>12</sup> That is, <italic>according to the measure of his wickedness</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1462"><sup>13</sup> It refers to the intensity of the blows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1463"><sup>14</sup> In other words, all those who are punished by flogging receive 40 lashes. However, their intensity varies according to the type of sin committed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1464"><sup>15</sup> That this particular individual is flogged.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1465"><sup>16</sup> The Karaites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1466"><sup>17</sup> The deniers render <italic>be-disho</italic>, before he treads. The muzzle is not put on the animal while he treads. It is put on the animal before the treading begins. Hence their interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1467"><sup>18</sup> For the meaning of Scripture is, do not put a muzzle on the animal so that it is muzzled while it treads the grain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1468"><sup>19</sup> Hebrew, <italic>achim</italic> (brothers).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1469"><sup>20</sup> The brothers spoken of in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1470"><sup>21</sup> For Scripture explicitly prohibits a man from marrying his sister-inlaw. See Lev. 18:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1471"><sup>22</sup> Boaz married Ruth, who was the wife of his deceased relative, <italic>to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance</italic> (Ruth 4:5).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1472"><sup>23</sup> In the Book of Ruth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1473"><sup>24</sup> Boaz married Ruth so that her husband&#x2019;s field would not pass into the hands of a stranger. He thus &#x201C;redeemed&#x201D; the said field. See Ruth 4:1-6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1474"><sup>25</sup> In our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1475"><sup>26</sup> According to the Rabbinic tradition the word brethren means brothers and together means alive at the same time. However, if we accept the Karaitic interpretation then we do not know what Scripture means by the word together.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1476"><sup>27</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. <italic>Mikra&#x2019;ot Gedolot</italic> reads: He says.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1477"><sup>28</sup> The word <italic>yavam</italic> means a brother-in-law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1478"><sup>29</sup> The Karaites interpret <italic>ve-yibbemah</italic> as, and be a brother-in-law to her. Now if the true brother-in-law was being addressed Scripture would not say, and be a brother-in-law to her. Hence we must interpret <italic>ve-yibbemah</italic> as meaning &#x201C;act as a brother-in-law to her.&#x201D; The upshot of all this is that a true brother-in-law is not being addressed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1479"><sup>30</sup> <italic>Yevimtekh</italic> is the word <italic>yevamah</italic> (sister-in-law) plus the second person personal pronoun. Orpah was the wife of Ruth&#x2019;s brother-in-law (<italic>yavam</italic>). She is referred to as a <italic>yevamah</italic> because she took her husband&#x2019;s place. We thus see that the term <italic>yavam</italic> in its various forms can refer to one who acts like one&#x2019;s brother-in-law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1480"><sup>31</sup> Tamar, the widow of Er the son of Judah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1481"><sup>32</sup> Judah told his son Onan to go <italic>and perform the duty of a husband&#x2019;s brother unto</italic> your sister-in-law Tamar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1482"><sup>33</sup> Onan the brother of Er.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1483"><sup>34</sup> Tamar&#x2019;s.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1484"><sup>35</sup> It is thus clear that levirate marriage was performed by the actual brother-in-law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1485"><sup>36</sup> In other words, the term <italic>yevamah</italic> was not employed figuratively in Ruth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1486"><sup>37</sup> Excluding the Noahide laws, which were given to Adam and Noah (see Meijler).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1487"><sup>38</sup> There was thus no prohibition before the revelation at Sinai against a man to marrying his sister-in-law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1488"><sup>39</sup> That is, from those negative commandments from which reason tells us to abstain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1489"><sup>40</sup> In other words, God would have been pleased with a person who abstained from practices which He would later prohibit. If the law prohibiting intercourse with a sister-in-law was based on reason, i.e., it was an abomination, then Scripture would not have condemned Onan for not wanting to impregnate his sister-in-law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1490"><sup>41</sup> From engaging in the practices that Lev. 18:27 refers to, for Scripture believes that one ought to know not to engage in these practices by employing one&#x2019;s rationality. See <italic>Yesod Mora</italic> 5: &#x201C;The fundamental commandments are those precepts that are implanted in the heart. They&#x2026;were known by reason before the Torah was given through the agency of Moses&#x201D; (Strickman translation, p. 75).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1491"><sup>42</sup> God thus wants a brother to marry the childless widow of his biological brother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1492"><sup>43</sup> The living brother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1493"><sup>44</sup> According to the rabbis, &#x201C;together&#x201D; means that they were alive at the same time. See <italic>Yevamot</italic> 17b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1494"><sup>45</sup> In other words, abroad (<italic>ha-chutzah</italic>) means to <italic>one not of his kin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1495"><sup>46</sup> If her brother-in-law does not want to marry her, she is free to marry anyone else after the ceremony of <italic>chalitzah</italic> has been performed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1496"><sup>47</sup> Deceased.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1497"><sup>48</sup> The property of the dead brother will be given to the first son born of the levirate marriage. The name of the deceased will thus be tied to his property, for people will say, &#x201C;This is the property of the deceased, which his &#x2018;son&#x2019; (actually his nephew) inherited.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1498"><sup>49</sup> According to the rabbis, <italic>And it shall be, that the first-born that she beareth&#x2026;</italic>refers to the deceased&#x2019;s first-born brother (<italic>Yevamot</italic> 24a). See Rashi on this verse, &#x201C;It is the eldest brother who is to perform the duty of levirate marriage.&#x201D; I.E. in his short commentary on Ex. 21:8 states that this interpretation is not in keeping with the plain meaning of the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1499"><sup>50</sup> In other words, the word <italic>yevami</italic> is not the noun <italic>yavam</italic> (brother-in-law) plus the <italic>yod</italic> suffix meaning &#x201C;my&#x201D; but a combination of the verb <italic>yabem</italic> plus the <italic>yo</italic>d suffix meaning me.

Since Scripture wrote, <italic>Therefore it shall be, when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest</italic> (Deut. 25:19),<sup><xref rid="fn1531">1</xref></sup> God now says that there are commandments that must be observed before He gives you rest. In fact, these commandments take effect as soon as you enter the land. They are: the first fruits,<sup><xref rid="fn1532">2</xref></sup> the tithes,<sup><xref rid="fn1533">3</xref></sup> writing the Torah on the stones,<sup><xref rid="fn1534">4</xref></sup> building the altar,<sup><xref rid="fn1535">5</xref></sup> and the blessing and the curse on the two mountains.<sup><xref rid="fn1536">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. IN A BASKET. <italic>Tene</italic> (basket) is a basket-like receptacle. The word <italic>tanakha</italic> (thy basket) (Deut 28:5) is its companion.<sup><xref rid="fn1537">7</xref></sup> This commandment<sup><xref rid="fn1538">8</xref></sup> is incumbent upon those who are close to the place of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>3. [THAT SHALL BE IN THOSE DAYS.] <italic>In those days</italic> means that this law is in force as long as there is a <italic>kohen gadol</italic> there.<sup><xref rid="fn1539">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>I PROFESS. The reason for this utterance is so that the children will hear. Or it is, like a statement of thanks to God, for He has fulfilled his oath. The fruit<sup><xref rid="fn1540">10</xref></sup> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1541">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THOU SHALT SPEAK. It is possible that the <italic>kohanim</italic> will ask,<sup><xref rid="fn1542">12</xref></sup> &#x201C;What is this that you brought?&#x201D; Hence Scripture reads <italic>ve-anita</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1543">13</xref></sup> (and thou shalt speak). On the other hand, <italic>ve-anita</italic> may mean, and you shall begin speaking. Compare, <italic>And Job spoke</italic> (va-ya&#x2019;an)<sup><xref rid="fn1544">14</xref></sup> <italic>and said</italic> (Job 3:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1545">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>A WANDERING ARAMEAN. The word <italic>oved</italic> (wandering) is an intransitive verb. If Aramean referred to Laban<sup><xref rid="fn1546">16</xref></sup> then Scripture should have read <italic>mavid or me&#x2019;abbed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1547">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, what reason would Scripture have had for stating, <italic>Laban sought to destroy my father and he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1548">18</xref></sup> <italic>went down to Egypt</italic>? Laban did not cause Jacob to descend to Egypt. It thus appears to me that the term Aramean refers to Jacob. Scripture, as it were, reads, when my father was in Aram he was &#x201C;perishing.&#x201D; That is, he was poor, he had no money. Similarly <italic>oved</italic> (perish) in <italic>Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish</italic> (Prov. 31:6). <italic>Let him drink, and forget his poverty</italic> (Prov. 31:7) is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn1549">19</xref></sup> The meaning of our phrase thus is, a perishing Aramean was my father. Its import is, I did not inherit the land from my father, for my father was poor when he came to Aram.<sup><xref rid="fn1550">20</xref></sup> He was also a stranger in Egypt. He was few in number.<sup><xref rid="fn1551">21</xref></sup> He then became a large nation.<sup><xref rid="fn1552">22</xref></sup> You O Lord took us out of slavery and gave us a good land. Let the one who disputes<sup><xref rid="fn1553">23</xref></sup> not argue, &#x201C;How could Jacob be called an Aramean?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1554">24</xref></sup> Look, we find the same with Ithra the Ishmaelite<sup><xref rid="fn1555">25</xref></sup> who, as Scripture clearly states,<sup><xref rid="fn1556">26</xref></sup> was an Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn1557">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>FEW IN NUMBER.<sup><xref rid="fn1558">28</xref></sup> The word <italic>mete</italic> (men of) is in the construct,<sup><xref rid="fn1559">29</xref></sup> for it is not found in the singular.<sup><xref rid="fn1560">30</xref></sup> The word <italic>metim</italic> is a plural. Rabbi Jonah the grammarian explained it very well under the entry <italic>mem, tav, heh</italic>.</p>
<p>7. OUR AFFLICTION. In lacking wealth.</p>
<p>OUR TOIL. In building.<sup><xref rid="fn1561">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>OUR OPPRESSION.<sup><xref rid="fn1562">32</xref></sup> As in [<italic>And the taskmasters] were urgent, saying: Fulfill your work</italic> (Ex. 5:13).</p>
<p>11. [THOU, AND THE LEVITE, AND THE STRANGER.] This means you are obligated to cheer them up with the fruit of your land.</p>
<p>12. OF TITHING. <italic>La-ser</italic> (of tithing) is a <italic>hifil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1563">33</xref></sup> It has no neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn1564">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHICH IS THE YEAR OF TITHING. The reference is to the poor tithe.<sup><xref rid="fn1565">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNTO THE LEVITE, TO THE STRANGER, TO THE FATHERLESS. To any one of them that you wish.<sup><xref rid="fn1566">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. I HAVE PUT AWAY THE HALLOWED THINGS. The reference is to the tithe. I have also not deposited it.<sup><xref rid="fn1567">37</xref></sup> On the contrary, I have handed it over to the one I am obligated to give it to.</p>
<p>I HAVE NOT TRANSGRESSED. Deliberately.</p>
<p>NEITHER HAVE I FORGOTTEN THEM.<sup><xref rid="fn1568">38</xref></sup> I did not forget to take the tithes from my house. Or its meaning is, I did not forget to give the two tithes.<sup><xref rid="fn1569">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. I HAVE NOT EATEN THEREOF IN MY MOURNING. The word <italic>oni</italic> (my mourning) is similar to the word <italic>oni</italic> (sorrow) in <italic>ben-oni</italic> (the son of my sorrow) (Gen. 35:18) and <italic>onim</italic> (mourners) in <italic>bread of mourners</italic> (Hosea 9:4). I alluded<sup><xref rid="fn1570">40</xref></sup> to its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn1571">41</xref></sup> in Hebrew.<sup><xref rid="fn1572">42</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>oni</italic> is, my mourning. If I was in mourning then I did not eat of it before setting aside the tithe.<sup><xref rid="fn1573">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>NEITHER HAVE I PUT AWAY THEREOF. This means neither did I destroy any of that which was holy.<sup><xref rid="fn1574">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>BEING UNCLEAN. <italic>Be-tame</italic> (being unclean) means for something unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn1575">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THE DEAD. For the need of the dead. Others say the reference is to idol worship.<sup><xref rid="fn1576">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>These things<sup><xref rid="fn1577">47</xref></sup> are enumerated<sup><xref rid="fn1578">48</xref></sup> because it is prohibited to use the grain for any purpose before giving of the tithe which is holy.<sup><xref rid="fn1579">49</xref></sup> If he gives from the remainder he is acting disrespectfully.<sup><xref rid="fn1580">50</xref></sup> This is certainly so if he exchanges it for something unclean. As I kept myself and I kept the grain, that is, I removed that which is holy from my house, so may our God watch over our country.<sup><xref rid="fn1581">51</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>and the land</italic> (v. 15).</p>
<p>15. [A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY.] It means a land that will always flow with milk and honey.<sup><xref rid="fn1582">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THIS DAY. These are the words of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1583">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU SHALT THEREFORE OBSERVE. In your heart.</p>
<p>AND DO THEM. In the land.</p>
<p>17. THOU HAST AVOUCHED. <italic>He&#x2019;emarta</italic> (avouched) means exalted. It is close in meaning to <italic>amir</italic> (uppermost bough) in <italic>In the top of the uppermost bough</italic> (Is. 17:6). Rabbi Yehudah Ha-Levi, who rests in Eden, says that the word is related to <italic>va-yomer</italic> (said). Its meaning is, you were so righteous that the Lord said He is your God. God likewise acted very righteously towards you that you said that you would be His own treasure. He explained well. Now the word <italic>he&#x2019;emarta</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1584">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND TO MAKE THEE HIGH. This is the reward for extolling God.</p>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 27</title>
<p>1. AND MOSES&#x2026;COMMANDED. By the dictate of God.</p>
<p>AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL. He<sup><xref rid="fn1585">1</xref></sup> said this to lighten his load.<sup><xref rid="fn1586">2</xref></sup> There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn1587">3</xref></sup> I have previously noted them.<sup><xref rid="fn1588">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>KEEP ALL THE COMMANDMENTS. Namely, <italic>that thou shalt set thee up great stones</italic> to contain the entire Torah. The Gaon,<sup><xref rid="fn1589">5</xref></sup> of blessed memory, said that the commandments<sup><xref rid="fn1590">6</xref></sup> were listed upon the stones, as in the <italic>Halakhot Gedolot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1591">7</xref></sup> They were listed in a manner similar to the <italic>azharot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1592">8</xref></sup> He explained well.</p>
<p>2. [WITH PLASTER] Plaster was employed so that it<sup><xref rid="fn1593">9</xref></sup> would last.<sup><xref rid="fn1594">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. THAT THOU MAYEST. For God will aid you<sup><xref rid="fn1595">11</xref></sup> if you begin to observe His commandments. This first precept upon entering the Land of Israel, namely, the command to build a new altar, was to give thanks to God for their starting to inherit the land.</p>
<p>8. VERY PLAINLY. The reference is to the writing.</p>
<p>9. AND MOSES AND THE PRIESTS THE LEVITES. This is in keeping with Scripture&#x2019;s statement, <italic>and the elders of Israel</italic> (v. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn1596">12</xref></sup> Moses was the main one.<sup><xref rid="fn1597">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>KEEP SILENCE. The meaning of the word <italic>hasket</italic> (keep silence) can only be known from its context, for it has no neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn1598">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>THIS DAY THOU ART BECOME A PEOPLE. For God will make a covenant with you.</p>
<p>10. THOU SHALT THEREFORE HEARKEN. Today, to His voice.</p>
<p>AND DO HIS COMMANDMENTS. In the future.</p>
<p>Scripture mentions <italic>the priests and the Levites</italic> (v. 9), for they are the ones who said, <italic>Cursed be the man</italic> (v. 15). The children of the main wives<sup><xref rid="fn1599">15</xref></sup> stood over the blessings,<sup><xref rid="fn1600">16</xref></sup> while the children of the handmaids<sup><xref rid="fn1601">17</xref></sup> stood over the curse.<sup><xref rid="fn1602">18</xref></sup> Now if the latter lacked two,<sup><xref rid="fn1603">19</xref></sup> the sons of Leah were numerous,<sup><xref rid="fn1604">20</xref></sup> and her oldest<sup><xref rid="fn1605">21</xref></sup> and youngest<sup><xref rid="fn1606">22</xref></sup> were taken.<sup><xref rid="fn1607">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THE LEVITES SHALL SPEAK. <italic>Ve-anu</italic> (shall speak) is similar to <italic>ve-anita</italic> (and thou shalt speak) in <italic>And thou shalt speak and say</italic> (Deut. 26:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1608">24</xref></sup> Our rabbis, of blessed memory, said that the meaning of <italic>to bless</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1609">25</xref></sup> is to say, <italic>blessed is the man who does not make a graven or molten image</italic>, and similarly all of them.<sup><xref rid="fn1610">26</xref></sup> However, according to the plain meaning of the text, the blessing refers to <italic>Blessed shalt thou be in the city</italic> (Deut. 28:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1611">27</xref></sup> The curse is the reverse of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1612">28</xref></sup> Proof of this is found in the Book of Joshua.<sup><xref rid="fn1613">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture mentions these eleven sins<sup><xref rid="fn1614">30</xref></sup> because an individual can commit them in secret. <italic>And setteth it up in secret</italic> (v. 15) is proof, for if one commits this crime<sup><xref rid="fn1615">31</xref></sup> in the open he is put to death.<sup><xref rid="fn1616">32</xref></sup> <italic>He that smiteth his neighbor in secret</italic> (v. 24) is similar.</p>
<p>Scripture begins with the most important, namely, that which concerns a person and his creator.<sup><xref rid="fn1617">33</xref></sup> It then speaks of a person and his parents,<sup><xref rid="fn1618">34</xref></sup> for who knows if he dishonors them.<sup><xref rid="fn1619">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. DISHONORETH. The word <italic>makleh</italic> (dishonoreth) means to dishonor. It is a transitive verb.</p>
<p>17. CURSED BE HE THAT REMOVETH HIS NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S LANDMARK. For it is done in secret.</p>
<p>[MAKETH THE BLIND TO GO ASTRAY.] Likewise it is not possible for the blind person to identify the one who led him astray.</p>
<p>19. CURSED BE HE THAT PERVERTETH THE JUSTICE DUE TO THE STRANGER, FATHERLESS. For they have no one to help them. Look, this too is done in secret.<sup><xref rid="fn1620">36</xref></sup> Scripture mentions the stranger as well as the orphan and the widow because if the judge perverts the justice due others, they will accuse and publicize him. The stranger, the orphan, and the widow are powerless. Sleeping with one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s wife, with a sister, or with a mother-in-law is an act that is committed in secret, for one is not suspected when he is alone with any one of them. It is not so with other sins.<sup><xref rid="fn1621">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. CURSED BE HE THAT LIETH WITH ANY MANNER OF BEAST.<sup><xref rid="fn1622">38</xref></sup> Male or female, for neither have a mouth with which to cry out and protest. Thus, a female animal is like a male animal;<sup><xref rid="fn1623">39</xref></sup> therefore Scripture does not mention the male.</p>
<p>25. HE THAT TAKETH A BRIBE. According to many the reference is to the judge. According to my opinion the reference is to a false witness.</p>
<p>26. THAT CONFIRMETH NOT. Some say that the reference is to the entire Torah. Others say that it refers to the specifically mentioned sins.<sup><xref rid="fn1624">40</xref></sup> However, what they say is meaningless, for Scripture says, <italic>to do them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1625">41</xref></sup> However, it appears to me that Scripture cursed the violators of the precepts which are mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1626">42</xref></sup> It also cursed the one who secretly does not observe the positive commandments. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>to do them</italic>.</p>

<p>2. [AND&#x2026;SHALL COME.] The meaning of <italic>And&#x2026;shall come</italic> is that they shall come by themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn1628">2</xref></sup></p>

The reverse is written [in the curses].<sup><xref rid="fn1640">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. [THAT RISE UP AGAINST THEE.] Since Scripture earlier stated that God will set Israel on high above the nations (v. 1), it now goes on to say that should the nations revolt against Israel [the Lord will cause thine enemies] <italic>that rise up against thee</italic> [to be smitten before thee].</p>
<p>AND&#x2026;SEVEN. This means many.<sup><xref rid="fn1641">15</xref></sup> The number seven is employed because of the continuous cycle of seven days of the week.<sup><xref rid="fn1642">16</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn1643">17</xref></sup> has a set number of days because is contingent on the bodies which are on high.<sup><xref rid="fn1644">18</xref></sup></p>

<p>AND THOU SHALT LEND UNTO MANY NATIONS. For they shall suffer famine. However, no time shall come where you shall borrow. The sum of the matter is, you will always be on top.<sup><xref rid="fn1649">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. IF THOU SHALT HEARKEN. In your heart to observe and to do. The sum of the matter is, do not turn aside from God to serve idols, for the root of all sins is to deny God.<sup><xref rid="fn1650">24</xref></sup> The reverse of the aforementioned is to affirm that the Lord is one and to hearken and to observe, for the most important aspect of hearkening is observing.</p>

Others say the reverse is true. Its meaning is then thin.<sup><xref rid="fn1655">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WITH MILDEW. <italic>Yerakon</italic> (mildew) is to be rendered according to its meaning in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn1656">30</xref></sup> Some say that these<sup><xref rid="fn1657">31</xref></sup> refer to diseases of the seed.<sup><xref rid="fn1658">32</xref></sup> <italic>U-vashiddafon</italic> (blasting) is similar to <italic>shidufot</italic> (blasted) in <italic>blasted with the east wind</italic> (Gen. 41:23). <italic>I have smitten you with blasting</italic> (shiddafon)<sup><xref rid="fn1659">33</xref></sup> <italic>and mildew</italic> (Amos 4:9) is proof. Therefore Scripture afterwards reads, <italic>and thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass</italic>. We find the same in the Torah portion <italic>If Ye Walk in My Statutes</italic> (Lev. 26:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1660">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. BRASS. Like brass. The same applies to iron.<sup><xref rid="fn1661">35</xref></sup></p>

<p>27. [THE BOIL OF EGYPT.] Those who remain will be struck with the boil of Egypt.</p>
<p>AND WITH THE EMERODS. They appear in the hidden places.<sup><xref rid="fn1668">42</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads <italic>u-vafolim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1669">43</xref></sup> (and with the emerods). The latter is related to the world <italic>ofel</italic> (hill) in <italic>And when he came to the hill</italic> (II Kings 5:24).<sup><xref rid="fn1670">44</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn1710"><sup>84</sup> The word reads <italic>oyevekha</italic> rather than <italic>oyivkha</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1711"><sup>85</sup> In other words, <italic>oyevekha</italic> is really a singular. Our text should thus be rendered, wherewith thine enemy shall straiten thee.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1718"><sup>92</sup> Suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1719"><sup>93</sup> A noun in the plural. <italic>Makkot</italic> is a plural.

However, the <italic>tav</italic> in <italic>makkotekha</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>, and <italic>makkotekha</italic> has no <italic>yod</italic> in it. The latter is the spelling and vocalization of the singular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1720"><sup>94</sup> <italic>Edot</italic> is a plural. Thus the word should read <italic>edotai</italic>, for &#x201C;i&#x201D; is a singular suffix. Thus <italic>edoti</italic> is a compound of a plural with a singular pronominal suffix.</ftnote>

</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 29</title>
<p>1. AND MOSES CALLED UNTO ALL ISRAEL. To establish a covenant. Scripture therefore reads afterwards, <italic>Ye are standing this day</italic> (v. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn1733">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reason Scripture reads <italic>Ye have seen</italic> and then <italic>And I have led</italic> (v. 4) and then <italic>And Og&#x2026;came out</italic> (v. 6) is that some of the Israelites saw the signs that God showed in Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn1734">2</xref></sup> and they and those who came after them<sup><xref rid="fn1735">3</xref></sup> saw the miracle of the manna,<sup><xref rid="fn1736">4</xref></sup> for they ate no food aside from the manna. And these sons<sup><xref rid="fn1737">5</xref></sup> saw that God helped them and they smote two kings (v. 6).</p>
<p>3. [BUT THE LORD HATH NOT GIVEN YOU A HEART TO KNOW.] Scripture reads a <italic>heart to know</italic> because they tested God ten times<sup><xref rid="fn1738">6</xref></sup> and did not make mention of the signs which they witnessed. Scripture reads <italic>given</italic> because God is the first cause.<sup><xref rid="fn1739">7</xref></sup> Furthermore,<sup><xref rid="fn1740">8</xref></sup> they saw that they had no need for bread or wine.<sup><xref rid="fn1741">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. [ARE NOT WAXEN OLD.] I have previously explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn1742">10</xref></sup> Sihon and Og were recently<sup><xref rid="fn1743">11</xref></sup> defeated.<sup><xref rid="fn1744">12</xref></sup> You are therefore<sup><xref rid="fn1745">13</xref></sup> obligated to keep the covenant.</p>
<p>8. THAT YE MAY&#x2026;PROSPER. <italic>Taskilu</italic> means prosper. It is a <italic>hifil</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1746">14</xref></sup> as the word <italic>ta&#x2019;asun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1747">15</xref></sup> (all that ye do) proves. Compare, <italic>maskil</italic> (great success) in <italic>And David had great success in all his ways</italic> (I Sam. 18:14).<sup><xref rid="fn1748">16</xref></sup></p>
<h1>NITZAVIM</h1>
<p>9. YE ARE STANDING THIS DAY. Around the ark.</p>
<p>YOUR HEADS. <italic>Roshekhem</italic> (your heads) is similar <italic>to ha</italic><italic>ohelah</italic> (the tent) in <italic>into the tent Sarah his mother</italic> (Gen. 24:67)<sup><xref rid="fn1749">17</xref></sup> and <italic>even the prophecy, Odad the prophet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1750">18</xref></sup> (II Chron. 15:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1751">19</xref></sup> <italic>Roshekhem shivtekhem</italic> (your heads, your tribes) is to be interpreted as your heads, who are the heads of your tribes.<sup><xref rid="fn1752">20</xref></sup> <italic>Roshekhem</italic> (your heads) is like the word <italic>va-niram</italic> (we have shot at them) (Num. 21:30).<sup><xref rid="fn1753">21</xref></sup> The word is to be so interpreted for the princes<sup><xref rid="fn1754">22</xref></sup> were closest to the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn1755">23</xref></sup> After them came the elders, followed by the officers, after whom came all the men of Israel, that is, the males, followed by the male little ones, after whom came the women, followed by the strangers.</p>
<p>11. THAT THOU SHOULDEST ENTER INTO THE COVENANT. <italic>Le-ovrekha</italic> (that thou shouldest enter) is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn1756">24</xref></sup> It is like <italic>va-ya&#x2019;avru</italic> (and passed) in <italic>and passed between the parts thereof</italic> (Jer. 34:18).<sup><xref rid="fn1757">25</xref></sup> Observe, the word <italic>avar</italic> (passed) minus the <italic>bet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1758">26</xref></sup> has the opposite meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn1759">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. NEITHER WITH YOU ONLY. But with you and with those who come after you, namely, your sons and your sons&#x2019; sons.</p>
<p>14. [BUT WITH HIM THAT STANDETH HERE WITH US THIS DAY.] The nun of <italic>yeshno</italic> (that standth here) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1760">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ALSO WITH HIM THAT IS NOT HERE WITH US. <italic>Ve&#x2019;et asher ennnu</italic> (and also with him that is not) means with him that is not here with us<sup><xref rid="fn1761">29</xref></sup> but will come after us. It is not to be interpreted as those who say that the spirits of the coming generations were there.<sup><xref rid="fn1762">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. FOR YE KNOW. There are among you some who witnessed the abominations of Egypt, namely, their gods. Additionally, all of you have seen the abominations of the nations.</p>
<p>WHICH YE PASSED. Among them, namely, the Edomites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, and the Midianites.</p>
<p>17. [A ROOT THAT BEARETH GALL AND WORMWOOD.] For gall injures the healthy.<sup><xref rid="fn1763">31</xref></sup> It is a disease that is infectious.<sup><xref rid="fn1764">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>[18. THIS CURSE.] This curse refers to <italic>Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image</italic> (Deut. 27:15).</p>
<p>THAT HE BLESS HIMSELF IN HIS HEART. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, of blessed memory, says <italic>that he bless himself</italic> is to be taken according to its plain meaning. When he hears the curse he will bless himself in his heart and say I shall have peace. In other words, when he hears the ban<sup><xref rid="fn1765">33</xref></sup> he will say it will not fall on me but upon someone else.</p>
<p>THAT&#x2026;BE SWEPT AWAY. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, who rests in paradise, says that the word <italic>sefot</italic> (swept away) means to extirpate. Compare, <italic>tispeh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1766">34</xref></sup> [thou (wilt) sweep away] in <italic>Wilt Thou indeed sweep away</italic> (Gen. 18:23). In other words, the one who blesses himself<sup><xref rid="fn1767">35</xref></sup> wants to nullify the words of the righteous,<sup><xref rid="fn1768">36</xref></sup> who are metaphorically called &#x201C;the watered,&#x201D; with the words of &#x201C;the dry.&#x201D; Look, the righteous are called watered. Compare, <italic>For he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water</italic> (Jer. 17:8). The wicked are called dry. Compare, <italic>For he shall be like a tamarisk in the desert</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>, v. 6). The wicked person thinks that the blessing which he utters in his heart will also stop the curse. He explained well were it not that the word <italic>ravah</italic> (well watered) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn1769">37</xref></sup> Our text should have read, <italic>ravi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1770">38</xref></sup> <italic>et ha-tzama</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1771">39</xref></sup> (the well watered&#x2026;with the dry).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jonah the grammarian<sup><xref rid="fn1772">40</xref></sup> says that it means<sup><xref rid="fn1773">41</xref></sup> because the corrupt sees the righteous<sup><xref rid="fn1774">42</xref></sup> destroyed along with the wicked<sup><xref rid="fn1775">43</xref></sup> he therefore thinks evil in his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn1776">44</xref></sup> However, this is incorrect because Scripture reads, <italic>I shall have peace</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1777">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>In my opinion the word <italic>sefot</italic> (swept) means to add. Compare, <italic>sefot chattat</italic> (add sin) (Is. 30:1). The added sin is the wicked person&#x2019;s statement, I shall have peace even though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart. I will live because of the righteousness of the righteous, for the pious are many and I am an individual sinner.<sup><xref rid="fn1778">46</xref></sup> Scripture therefore afterwards reads, <italic>The Lord will not be willing to pardon him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1779">47</xref></sup> <italic>but then&#x2026;</italic> (v. 19). The meaning of the latter is he shall immediately be destroyed. This verse is also proof of my interpretation of <italic>and he shall be forgiven</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1780">48</xref></sup> (Num. 15:28). The meaning of <italic>sefot</italic> is that the well watered will add to the dry. Scripture compares the righteous to the well watered, as in <italic>And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water</italic> (Ps. 1:3). It compares the wicked to the dry. Compare, <italic>For he shall be like a tamarisk in the desert</italic> (Jer. 17: 6). The fact that Scripture at first reads, <italic>a root that beareth gall and wormwood</italic> (v. 17), is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1781">49</xref></sup> It is in a dry place.<sup><xref rid="fn1782">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THE ANGER OF THE LORD&#x2026;SHALL BE KINDLED.<sup><xref rid="fn1783">51</xref></sup> The fire of God&#x2019;s anger shall bum him to the point where the smoke will be visible. Observe, if the sinner be an individual he will die immediately, and if it is a family <italic>all the curse&#x2026;shall lie upon him</italic>. This means that the curse shall lie upon the family until its name is eradicated. If the sinner be a tribe, <italic>the Lord shall separate him unto evil</italic> (v. 20).<sup><xref rid="fn1784">52</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>And I will offer it up for a burnt-offering</italic> (Jud. 11:31), as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1785">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THE GENERATION TO COME. Your children. Also the foreigners who see the plagues of the land.</p>
<p>22. BRIMSTONE. A prayer to God that all the land should be burnt in brimstone and salt like the overthrow of the places that are mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1786">54</xref></sup> Some explain that <italic>even all the nations shall say</italic> (v. 23) repeats what was stated earlier<sup><xref rid="fn1787">55</xref></sup> because Scripture went off on a tangent,<sup><xref rid="fn1788">56</xref></sup> as is the style of the language.<sup><xref rid="fn1789">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>[24.] THEN MEN SHALL SAY. The earlier inhabitants.<sup><xref rid="fn1790">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS.] They forsook the God that they and their fathers knew and they served gods whom they did not know.</p>
<p>25. AND THAT HE HAD NOT ALLOTTED UNTO THEM. I have previously explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn1791">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND THE LORD ROOTED THEM OUT. <italic>Va-yitteshem</italic> (and rooted them out) is missing a nun.<sup><xref rid="fn1792">60</xref></sup> Compare li-netosh (to root out) (Jer. 1:10). The <italic>nun</italic> is swallowed by the <italic>dagesh</italic>, as is the rule.<sup><xref rid="fn1793">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AS IS THIS DAY.] These are the words of the respondents.<sup><xref rid="fn1794">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. THE SECRET THINGS. The reference is to one who serves idols in secret.</p>
<p>BELONG UNTO THE LORD OUR GOD. Its meaning is that his punishment is in the hands of God, and the Lord will exact punishment from him. However, if the sin was committed in public there is an obligation on us and our children to do in accordance with that which is written in the Torah.</p>
<p>Others say<sup><xref rid="fn1795">63</xref></sup> that the secret and the revealed things belong to God. It is incumbent upon us only to observe the words of the Torah. Now this interpretation has no head or foot.<sup><xref rid="fn1796">64</xref></sup> What reason is there to mention this here?<sup><xref rid="fn1797">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture states that if you <italic>return unto the Lord</italic> (Deut. 30:2), <italic>God will turn thy captivity</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>, v. 3) even though you are outside of the land because it stated earlier, <italic>and cast them into another land</italic> (v. 27). According to Rabbi Judah<sup><xref rid="fn1798">66</xref></sup> the first grammarian, the meaning of <italic>ve-shav</italic> (then shall turn) (Deut. 30:3) means God will give rest;<sup><xref rid="fn1799">67</xref></sup> that is, he will give rest to the captives and be merciful to them, and after this He will return and gather.<sup><xref rid="fn1800">68</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1733"><sup>1</sup> And goes on to say, <italic>that thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the Lord</italic> (v. 11).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1734"><sup>2</sup> <italic>You have seen&#x2026;</italic>was directed to this group.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1735"><sup>3</sup> The first generation born in the wilderness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1736"><sup>4</sup> <italic>And I have led</italic>&#x2026;was directed to this group.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1737"><sup>5</sup> The second generation born in the wilderness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1738"><sup>6</sup> See Num. 14:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1739"><sup>7</sup> Man has free will and thus must develop a &#x201C;knowing heart&#x201D; on his own. However, our verse implies that it is God who gives man <italic>a heart to know</italic>. Hence I.E. points out that Scripture ascribes man&#x2019;s achievements to God because God is the first cause and in that sense can be said to give man <italic>a heart to know</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1740"><sup>8</sup> Israel is obligated to observe the commandments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1741"><sup>9</sup> In addition to the miracles which Israel witnessed in Egypt, they experienced the miracle of living in the wilderness for forty years without bread or wine (Meijler). In other words, our verse (and the one before it) continues the theme of verse 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1742"><sup>10</sup> See I.E. on Deut. 8:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1743"><sup>11</sup> Shortly before Moses gave this address.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1744"><sup>12</sup> Thus even the youngest among them witnessed the defeat of these kings. Furthermore, the event was fresh in their minds.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1745"><sup>13</sup> Because of what precedes it in verses 1-7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1746"><sup>14</sup> A causative.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1747"><sup>15</sup> <italic>Ta&#x2019;asun</italic> is the object of <italic>taskilu</italic>. Hence the meaning of <italic>le-ma&#x2019;an taskilu et kol asher ta&#x2019;asun</italic> is that <italic>ye may make to prosper all that ye do</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1748"><sup>16</sup> We thus see that the word <italic>maskil</italic> means to prosper. The root of <italic>maskil</italic> (<italic>sin, kaf, lamed</italic>) means intelligence. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1749"><sup>17</sup> Translated literally. According to I. E. <italic>into the tent Sarah his mother</italic> is short for into the tent, the tent of Sarah his mother. Similarly, <italic>your heads</italic> is short for your heads the heads of. See I.E. on Gen. 24:67 (Vol. 1, p. 243).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1750"><sup>18</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1751"><sup>19</sup> According to I.E. <italic>even the prophecy, Odad the prophet</italic> is short for even the prophecy, the prophecy of Odad the prophet. See I.E. on Gen. 24:67 (Vol. 1, p. 243).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1752"><sup>20</sup> <italic>Roshekhem shivtekhem</italic> is short for <italic>roshekhem roshe shivtekhem</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1753"><sup>21</sup> Num. 21:30 reads, <italic>va-niram avad cheshbon</italic> (we have shot at them, Heshbon is destroyed). According to I.E. this is to be interpreted as And their king, the king of Heshbon was destroyed. See I.E. on Num. 21:30 (Vol. 4, p. 175).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1754"><sup>22</sup> The heads of the tribes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1755"><sup>23</sup> According to I.E. our verse records the hierarchical arrangement of the Israelites before the ark, when the covenant was made. If we take our verse literally the word &#x201C;tribes&#x201D; breaks up the arrangement. Hence I.E. insists that our verse reads, your heads, the heads of your tribes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1756"><sup>24</sup> With the pronominal suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1757"><sup>25</sup> In other words, <italic>le-ovrekha</italic> (that thou shouldest enter) means that you should pass, i.e., that you should enter the covenant, for they used to cut an animal in half when making a covenant and walk between the halves.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1758"><sup>26</sup> Following it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1759"><sup>27</sup> The word <italic>avar</italic> preceding <italic>brit</italic> means to violate the covenant. Hence our verse reads, <italic>le-ovrekha bi-verit</italic>. Had our verse read, <italic>le-ovrekha berit</italic>, it would have meant that you should violate the covenant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1760"><sup>28</sup> <italic>Yeshno</italic> is the word <italic>yesh</italic> plus the third person pronominal suffix. That suffix is a <italic>vav</italic>. Thus we would expect <italic>yesho</italic> rather than <italic>yeshno</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1761"><sup>29</sup> Here with us today. In other words, <italic>ve&#x2019;et</italic> means and with. This is not the usual meaning of <italic>et</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. See I.E. on Gen. 1:1 (Vol. 1, p. 27): <italic>&#x201C;Et</italic> means the very thing&#x2026;However, sometimes&#x2026;<italic>et</italic> is used in place of with.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1762"><sup>30</sup> This is the opinion of some <italic>midrashim</italic>. See <italic>Tanchuma, Nitzavim: The souls were there, but the bodies</italic> [these souls were to enter] <italic>had not yet been created</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1763"><sup>31</sup> Hence it symbolizes idolatry. Even a spiritually healthy person is injured by idolatry.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1764"><sup>32</sup> The person afflicted by idolatry will infect others.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1765"><sup>33</sup> The curse.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1767"><sup>35</sup> The wicked.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1768"><sup>36</sup> Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1769"><sup>37</sup> As is <italic>tzeme&#x2019;ah</italic> (dry). The point is that Rabbi Judah&#x2019;s interpretation requires that nouns, not adjectives, be employed in our verse, for according to his interpretation the verse speaks of people. Filwarg argues that Rabbi Judah&#x2019;s interpretation requires a noun because the dry and the watered are metaphors for curses and blessing, which are nouns. He interprets in this manner because later on I.E. himself interprets the dry and the watered as referring to people. The problem with Filwarg&#x2019;s interpretation is that I.E. quotes Rabbi Judah as saying, &#x201C;The righteous are called watered&#x2026;The wicked are called dry.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1770"><sup>38</sup> A noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1771"><sup>39</sup> A noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1772"><sup>40</sup> Rabbi Jonah ibn Janach.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1773"><sup>41</sup> The meaning of <italic>that he blesses himself in his heart&#x2026;that the watered are swept away with the dry</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1774"><sup>42</sup> The watered.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1775"><sup>43</sup> The dry.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1776"><sup>44</sup> Rabbi Jonah&#x2019;s interpretation of <italic>that he bless himself in his heart</italic>. The wicked person says I might as well be wicked, for both the righteous and the wicked suffer one fate. They are both swept away.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1777"><sup>45</sup> <italic>That he blesses himself in his heart</italic> implies that he says something positive to himself. However, there is nothing positive in saying the righteous and I will be swept away.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1778"><sup>46</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation of <italic>the watered be swept away with the dry</italic>. A nation is judged by the majority of its people. The wicked believe that the merit of the majority, who are righteous, will protect the sinners, who are a minority.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1779"><sup>47</sup> Hebrew, <italic>selo&#x2019;ach lo</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1780"><sup>48</sup> <italic>Hebrew, ve-nislach lo</italic>. According to I.E. the word <italic>salach</italic> means to delay punishment. See I.E. on Num. 14:19, &#x201C;Selach refers to being slow to anger.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1781"><sup>49</sup> That dry refers to the wicked.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1782"><sup>50</sup> The <italic>root that beareth gall and wormwood</italic> grows in parched land. Hence the wicked person is called the dry (Meijler, Krinsky). I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation presents a problem. He interprets &#x201C;the watered and the dry&#x201D; as referring to people. However, earlier I.E. rejects Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi&#x2019;s interpretation for this very reason. As noted above, Filwarg attempts to justify I.E.&#x2019;s position. However, his interpretation is forced.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1783"><sup>51</sup> Hebrew, <italic>yeshan</italic> (literally, shall smoke). Our clause literally reads, the anger of the Lord&#x2026;shall smoke. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1784"><sup>52</sup> Thus <italic>The anger of the Lord&#x2026;shall be kindled against that man</italic> refers to an individual; <italic>and all the curse&#x2026;shall lie upon him</italic> refers to a family; <italic>and the Lord shall separate him unto evil</italic> refers to a tribe.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1785"><sup>53</sup> We no longer have I.E.&#x2019;s commentary on Judges. However, Radak in his comments on Judges notes that the <italic>vav</italic> there has the meaning of or. It appears that I.E. interpreted similarly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1786"><sup>54</sup> Our verse records the prayer that will be offered by coming generations and by the foreigner. When they see what God did to the land, they too will curse it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1787"><sup>55</sup> In verse 21. Our verse repeats parts of verse 21 because it picks up its trend of thought.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1788"><sup>56</sup> In verse 22. In other words, verse 23 is a continuation of verse 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1789"><sup>57</sup> To go off on a tangent and then return to the original point.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1790"><sup>58</sup> The earlier inhabitants shall respond to their children and to the foreigner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1791"><sup>59</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on <italic>which the Lord thy God hath allotted</italic> (Deut. 4:19).</ftnote>

<p>4. IN THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF HEAVEN. With regard to the Land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1801">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND THE LORD THY GOD WILL CIRCUMCISE. For He is the first cause of all actions.<sup><xref rid="fn1802">2</xref></sup> After saying, you shall return unto the Lord and listen to His voice,<sup><xref rid="fn1803">3</xref></sup> Moses says that unlike the circumcision of the flesh, which you are obligated to execute, God will help you and will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed.</p>
<p>9. [AND THE LORD THY GOD WILL MAKE THEE OVERABUNDANT.] Scripture states <italic>ve-hotirekha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1804">4</xref></sup> (make thee overabundant) because God will place curses upon the enemies [of Israel]<sup><xref rid="fn1805">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>AS HE REJOICED OVER THY FATHERS. Who inherited the land, for Scripture addresses those who were exiled from it.</p>
<p>10. WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK OF THE LAW. For the main part of all the commandments is there,<sup><xref rid="fn1806">6</xref></sup> although they need the explanation provided by tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn1807">7</xref></sup> They<sup><xref rid="fn1808">8</xref></sup> cannot be kept unless the heart is complete.<sup><xref rid="fn1809">9</xref></sup> Scripture therefore states, <italic>with all thy heart</italic>, for the commandment to keep means to keep with one&#x2019;s heart.<sup><xref rid="fn1810">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. TOO HARD. The word <italic>niflet</italic> (too hard) means concealed.<sup><xref rid="fn1811">11</xref></sup> Or its meaning is, wondrous, that is, something that will cause you to grow weary while trying to accomplish it.<sup><xref rid="fn1812">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. IT IS NOT IN HEAVEN. This explains <italic>niflet</italic> (too hard) (v. 11).</p>
<p>13. BEYOND THE SEA. This explains <italic>neither is it far off</italic> (v. 11). It is possible that the reference is to the great sea<sup><xref rid="fn1813">13</xref></sup> whose width a person cannot enter<sup><xref rid="fn1814">14</xref></sup> because of the darkness of the water.<sup><xref rid="fn1815">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. IN THY MOUTH, AND IN THY HEART. For the heart is the core of the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn1816">16</xref></sup> Some commandments require the uttering of statements which serve to reinforce the heart.<sup><xref rid="fn1817">17</xref></sup> Others consist of deeds<sup><xref rid="fn1818">18</xref></sup> so that a person will utter the required statements.<sup><xref rid="fn1819">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. LIFE. Long life.<sup><xref rid="fn1820">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND GOOD. Wealth, bodily health and honor. Death and evil are the reverse of the above.</p>
<p>16. TO LOVE. This is most important.</p>
<p>TO WALK IN HIS WAYS. You shall not modify the way He asked you to act<sup><xref rid="fn1821">21</xref></sup> and the precepts which He commanded you, even though you do not know why the statutes and ordinances were given. Note, <italic>Then thou shalt live</italic> explains the term <italic>life</italic> (v. 15).</p>
<p>AND MULTIPLY. This explains <italic>and good</italic> (v. 15), for it refers to material increase,<sup><xref rid="fn1822">22</xref></sup> that is, in children and in wealth.</p>
<p>17. BUT IF THY HEART TURN AWAY. For the heart is most important.<sup><xref rid="fn1823">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT SHALT BE DRAWN AWAY. I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>ve-niddachta</italic> (but shall be drawn away).<sup><xref rid="fn1824">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. THAT YE SHALL SURELY PERISH. This explains <italic>death and evil</italic> (v. 15), for they and their children and their wealth shall perish.</p>
<p>YE SHALL NOT PROLONG YOUR DAYS. The reverse of <italic>the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land</italic> (v. 16).</p>
<p>19. HEAVEN AND EARTH. For they endure.<sup><xref rid="fn1825">25</xref></sup> Similarly with regard to <italic>this stone shall be a witness against us</italic> (Josh. 24:27) and <italic>Hear, O ye mountains, the Lord&#x2019;s controversy</italic> (Micah 6:2).</p>
<p>LIFE AND DEATH. The reference is to <italic>the blessing and the curse</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1826">26</xref></sup> Observe, it is incumbent upon you to choose life.<sup><xref rid="fn1827">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT THOU MAYEST LIVE. Physically or in memory. Scripture explains that life is to love.<sup><xref rid="fn1828">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. FOR THAT IS THY LIFE.<sup><xref rid="fn1829">29</xref></sup> According to the commentaries this refers to the voice of God. I believe that the reference is to God,<sup><xref rid="fn1830">30</xref></sup> as the poet says,<sup><xref rid="fn1831">31</xref></sup> the Lord is my salvation;<sup><xref rid="fn1832">32</xref></sup> <italic>The God of my mercy</italic> (Ps. 59:11); <italic>My shield</italic> (Ps. 18:3); and my sword.<sup><xref rid="fn1833">33</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1801"><sup>1</sup> For a person living in the Land of Israel, the place of Israel&#x2019;s exile appears to be at the uttermost parts of the heavens. However, in truth the heavens have no uttermost part for they are round.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1802"><sup>2</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of I Sam. 2:3. In other words, God is the first cause who gave man the power to circumcise his heart. Since all things can be traced back to God, God can be said to &#x201C;circumcise&#x201D; man&#x2019;s heart. <italic>And the Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart</italic> seems to indicate that man has no free will, for it implies that God will change man&#x2019;s nature so that he will no longer sin. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1803"><sup>3</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of the opening of verse 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1804"><sup>4</sup> I. E. renders <italic>ve-hotirekha</italic> as He will permit you to remain.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1810"><sup>10</sup> Belief must accompany observance. See I.E. on Ex. 31:18 (Vol. 2, p. 653).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1811"><sup>11</sup> See Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1812"><sup>12</sup> In other words, too hard.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1815"><sup>15</sup> A dark cloud covers it. I.E. like other medievalists believed that one cannot cross the &#x201C;large sea.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1816"><sup>16</sup> The commandments that pertain to the heart are the most important ones. Among the latter are the commandments to believe in God, to love God, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1817"><sup>17</sup> We thus recite the <italic>shema</italic> to reinforce our belief.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1818"><sup>18</sup> Such as donning <italic>tefilin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1819"><sup>19</sup> So that a person will remember to recall verbally the commandment tied to the ritual. However, not all commandments observed by deeds have this as their purpose. See I.E. on Ex. 31:18 (Vol. 2, p. 410) where he divides the positive commandments into three categories: those to be observed by the heart, those to be observed by speech, and those to be observed by action.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1820"><sup>20</sup> A person must ultimately die. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1821"><sup>21</sup> Literally, the way of His deeds.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1822"><sup>22</sup> Literally, an increase in bodies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1823"><sup>23</sup> Hence it personifies the entire human being.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1824"><sup>24</sup> See I.E. on Deut. 4:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1825"><sup>25</sup> From generation to generation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1826"><sup>26</sup> <italic>The blessing and the curse</italic> is not an addition to what precedes it but is synonymous with it.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1828"><sup>28</sup> The object of life is to love God.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1831"><sup>31</sup> We should not be surprised that the Torah refers to God by the term life. For Scripture terms God my sword, my shield, my mercy, my salvation.</ftnote>

<h1>VA-YELEKH</h1>
<p>1. AND MOSES WENT. Moses went to each tribe and tribe to inform them that he was about to die and that they should not fear.<sup><xref rid="fn1834">1</xref></sup> He strengthened them<sup><xref rid="fn1835">2</xref></sup> with his words to Joshua.<sup><xref rid="fn1836">3</xref></sup> Scripture therefore afterwards reads, <italic>and thou shalt cause them to inherit it</italic> (v. 7). I believe that he then<sup><xref rid="fn1837">4</xref></sup> blessed the tribes.<sup><xref rid="fn1838">5</xref></sup> This is so even though the blessings are recorded later.<sup><xref rid="fn1839">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. GO OUT AND COME IN. In war.<sup><xref rid="fn1840">7</xref></sup> Even if I did not die now, I would not have the ability to wage war. You have no need for any person to help you, for God will destroy the nations.<sup><xref rid="fn1841">8</xref></sup> Joshua will do the same.<sup><xref rid="fn1842">9</xref></sup> What you saw with your eyes in the war of Sihon and Og is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn1843">10</xref></sup></p>

<p>AND MOSES&#x2026;WENT. From the camp of Israel, for that is where he was.<sup><xref rid="fn1855">22</xref></sup> He then came to the camp where God&#x2019;s presence rested.</p>
<p>15. AND THE LORD APPEARED IN THE TENT. The specified tent.<sup><xref rid="fn1856">23</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is that the pillar of cloud was at the door of the tent and God was seen inside the tent. This<sup><xref rid="fn1857">24</xref></sup> is what the glory<sup><xref rid="fn1858">25</xref></sup> refers to.<sup><xref rid="fn1859">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The statement <italic>that I may give him a charge</italic> (v. 14) refers to <italic>And he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1860">27</xref></sup> <italic>gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge</italic> (v. 23) by the command of God, may He be blessed. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>which I swore unto them</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1861">28</xref></sup> After this came the passage <italic>Behold, thou art about to sleep with thy fathers</italic> (v. 16).<sup><xref rid="fn1862">29</xref></sup> There is no chronological order in the Torah. The passage <italic>And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law</italic> (v. 24) is connected to<sup><xref rid="fn1863">30</xref></sup> <italic>And Moses wrote this law</italic> (v. 9).</p>
<p>16. AND THIS PEOPLE WILL RISE UP. It is not possible for this to be connected to what precedes it, for what reason is there to say,<sup><xref rid="fn1864">31</xref></sup> <italic>and this people will rise up, and go astray</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1865">32</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ve-zanah</italic> (and go astray) is, to leave God&#x2019;s authority<sup><xref rid="fn1866">33</xref></sup> in one&#x2019;s thought.</p>
<p>AFTER THE FOREIGN GODS OF THE LAND. We know that God is one.<sup><xref rid="fn1867">34</xref></sup> Change comes from the recepients.<sup><xref rid="fn1868">35</xref></sup> God does not change His works,<sup><xref rid="fn1869">36</xref></sup> for they are executed in wisdom. It is part of the service of God to harness one&#x2019;s power to receive spiritual inspiration in accordance with the place.<sup><xref rid="fn1870">37</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads, <italic>the manner of the God of the land</italic> (II Kings 17:26).<sup><xref rid="fn1871">38</xref></sup> Jacob therefore said,<sup><xref rid="fn1872">39</xref></sup> <italic>Put away the strange gods</italic> (Gen. 35:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1873">40</xref></sup> The place is unlike other places with regard to engaging in sexual intercourse with women whom Scripture deems as being of close flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn1874">41</xref></sup> The intelligent will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn1875">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AMONG THEM.] <italic>Be-kirbo</italic> (among them) refers to <italic>foreign</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1876">43</xref></sup> Scripture, as it were, states, and go astray after the gods of a foreign people,<sup><xref rid="fn1877">44</xref></sup> who are the gods of the land.<sup><xref rid="fn1878">45</xref></sup> However, it appears that <italic>be-kirbo</italic> refers to the word <italic>ha-aretz</italic> (of the land),<sup><xref rid="fn1879">46</xref></sup> for the word <italic>eretz</italic> is found in the masculine.<sup><xref rid="fn1880">47</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And the land</italic> (ha-aretz) <italic>was not able to bear</italic> (nasa)<sup><xref rid="fn1881">48</xref></sup> <italic>them</italic> (Gen. 13:6); <italic>the land</italic> [is] <italic>burnt up</italic> (netam<sup><xref rid="fn1882">49</xref></sup> aretz) (Is. 9:18).</p>
<p>17. AND I WILL FORSAKE THEM. All of them.</p>
<p>AND THEY SHALL BE.<sup><xref rid="fn1883">50</xref></sup> Each one of them shall be food for the enemy.<sup><xref rid="fn1884">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. [AND I WILL SURELY HIDE.] The meaning of <italic>And I will surely hide</italic> is, if they call Me, I will not answer. Scripture compares God to a person who does not see or know what is happening. It is the custom of Scripture to employ two verbs.<sup><xref rid="fn1885">52</xref></sup> Those who know grammar understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn1886">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THAT THEY ARE TURNED. This,<sup><xref rid="fn1887">54</xref></sup> as I previously explained,<sup><xref rid="fn1888">55</xref></sup> is the great evil. There is no evil which tops it.</p>
<p>19. NOW&#x2026;WRITE THIS. A commandment that Moses, and all who know how to write,<sup><xref rid="fn1889">56</xref></sup> should write it.</p>
<p>AND TEACH THOU IT. Explain to them the difficult meanings.</p>
<p>PUT IT IN THEIR MOUTHS. That they should be able to recite it orally.<sup><xref rid="fn1890">57</xref></sup> The words <italic>ve-lammedah</italic> (and teach thou it) and also <italic>simah</italic> (put it) are irregular, for grammatically the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>ve-lammedah</italic> should have been vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> and the <italic>lamed</italic> with a <italic>segol</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1891">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>A WITNESS&#x2026;AGAINST THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. This meaning of our verse is tied to <italic>For when I shall have brought them</italic> (v. 20).<sup><xref rid="fn1892">59</xref></sup> It is also possible that our verse is independent,<sup><xref rid="fn1893">60</xref></sup> because Scripture states, <italic>ve-anetah</italic> (that&#x2026;shall testify) (v. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn1894">61</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-anetah</italic> (that&#x2026;shall testify) is similar to <italic>ta&#x2019;aneh</italic> (bear)<sup><xref rid="fn1895">62</xref></sup> in <italic>thou shalt not bear&#x2026;against thy neighbor</italic> (Ex. 20: 13). The song, as it were, will testify before those who ask, &#x201C;Why did all this happen to us?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1896">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. BEFORE THEM. <italic>Le-fanav</italic> means before them. It means that the witness will not be removed from before them but shall always be with them.<sup><xref rid="fn1897">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR I KNOW THEIR IMAGINATION. For even if I did not know the future,<sup><xref rid="fn1898">65</xref></sup> I know what they have done until this day.<sup><xref rid="fn1899">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. THE SAME DAY. Moses did not tarry in doing this thing.<sup><xref rid="fn1900">67</xref></sup> It is possible that this took place on the day he died, which was after writing the words of the Torah, for Moses wrote the song with it.</p>
<p>24. UNTIL THEY WERE FINISHED. This is connected to <italic>the words</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1901">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. THAT MOSES COMMANDED THE LEVITES. Scripture is being brief.<sup><xref rid="fn1902">69</xref></sup> Our verse, as it were, says, the earlier-mentioned Levites who are <italic>kohanim</italic>, but not all the Levites, for they do not touch the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn1903">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT BORE THE ARK OF THE CONVENT OF THE LORD.] By command. There are many such instances.</p>
<p>26. IT MAY BE THERE FOR A WITNESS AGAINST THEE. Moses speaks to all of Israel. The <italic>kohanim</italic> are included when he speaks to Israel. However, when Moses addressed the Reubenites and the Gadites he spoke to them alone, as I previously explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1904">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND HOW MUCH MORE AFTER MY DEATH. In addition, I know that after my death&#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn1905">72</xref></sup> for God told me, <italic>and this people will rise up, and go astray</italic> (v. 16) after you sleep with your fathers. This is what <italic>after my death</italic> refers to.<sup><xref rid="fn1906">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. [BEFALL YOU.] The meaning of <italic>ve-karata</italic> (and&#x2026;will befall you) is similar to <italic>ve-chatat</italic> (but the fault is) in <italic>but the fault is in thine people</italic> (Ex. 5:15).<sup><xref rid="fn1907">74</xref></sup> It is explained there.<sup><xref rid="fn1908">75</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1834"><sup>1</sup> For they would not be left leaderless.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1835"><sup>2</sup> He encouraged them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1836"><sup>3</sup> <italic>Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt go with this people into the land</italic>, etc.,(vs. 7,8).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1837"><sup>4</sup> After charging Joshua <italic>in the sight of all of Israel</italic> (v. 7).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1838"><sup>5</sup> While they were assembled together.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1839"><sup>6</sup> In Deut. 33.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1840"><sup>7</sup> To lead you into battle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1841"><sup>8</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of the first part of verse 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1842"><sup>9</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation of <italic>and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath spoken</italic> (v. 3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1843"><sup>10</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation of verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1844"><sup>11</sup> See Deut. 7:5, which literally reads: <italic>But thus shall you do unto them&#x2026;dash in pieces their pillars</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1845"><sup>12</sup> As he did to Israel (v. 6).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1846"><sup>13</sup> Thus <italic>et ha-am</italic> means with this people. The word <italic>et</italic> usually indicates the accusative and is not translated. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1847"><sup>14</sup> To interpret the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1848"><sup>15</sup> The meaning of which is that the elders assisted Moses in transmitting the word of God. Similarly, here too Moses commanded the elders to assist the <italic>kohanim</italic> in teaching the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1849"><sup>16</sup> According to I.E. the word <italic>mi-ketz</italic> (at the end) sometimes means at the beginning. See I.E. on Deut. 15:1. I.E. interprets thus because the seventh year was to be a year of Torah study. He felt that the public reading of the Torah was not the climax of this year but the initiation of a year of Torah study.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1850"><sup>17</sup> The year was to be devoted to Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1851"><sup>18</sup> Is to be devoted to Torah study.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1852"><sup>19</sup> The Torah being read.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1853"><sup>20</sup> To pass away.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1854"><sup>21</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 23:26 (Vol. 2, p. 518).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1855"><sup>22</sup> When he took leave of and blessed Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1856"><sup>23</sup> The tent of meeting mentioned in the previous verse. Hence the word <italic>ohel</italic> (tent) has a <italic>heh ha-yedi&#x2019;ah</italic> prefixed to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1857"><sup>24</sup> The pillar of cloud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1858"><sup>25</sup> The glory of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1859"><sup>26</sup> When Scripture speaks of the glory of God appearing in the tent of meeting, the reference is to the pillar of cloud. See Ex. 16:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1860"><sup>27</sup> Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1861"><sup>28</sup> Moses uses the term &#x201C;I&#x201D; because he was speaking for God by God&#x2019;s command.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1862"><sup>29</sup> According to I.E. the sequence of events was as follows: Verses 14,15; 23; 16-22; 9. The reason for the aforementioned is purely exegetical. It allows for a logical, sequential unfolding of events.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1863"><sup>30</sup> It follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1864"><sup>31</sup> At this point.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1865"><sup>32</sup> Our verse does not logically follow God&#x2019;s telling Moses that He is going to charge Joshua. Hence verses 16-22 follow what is recorded in verse 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1866"><sup>33</sup> Literally, to leave God&#x2019;s domain, to believe in another god.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1867"><sup>34</sup> God is unchangeable. God remains the same at all times.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1868"><sup>35</sup> Of Divine beneficence. According to I.E. praying to God does not change God&#x2019;s mind. It changes the petitioner. The person changes his fate because he becomes a different person. Thus God&#x2019;s decrees remain unchangeable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1869"><sup>36</sup> The laws of nature, or any of His actions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1870"><sup>37</sup> The Land of Israel. According to I.E. if a person follows a certain way of life, i.e., following God&#x2019;s commandments, certain things will follow automatically. He also believed that God&#x2019;s influence varies in accordance with the place. Hence certain laws have to be followed in the Land of Israel if the land is to maintain its sanctity and receive the amount of divine influence allotted to it. See I.E. on Gen. 4:14; 28:16. Also see Ex. 15:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1871"><sup>38</sup> The reference is to the people whom the king of Assyria brought to Samaria. They wanted to learn the manner of the God of the land because they knew that if they wanted to remain in the Land of Israel, they would have to alter their ways to fit the religious requirements of the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1872"><sup>39</sup> To his sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1873"><sup>40</sup> According to I.E., Jacob told his sons, &#x201C;Now that we are in the Land of Israel put away the images which you held on to while you were outside of the Land of Israel.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1874"><sup>41</sup> A person is not allowed to marry a variety of close relatives. Among these are two sisters and an aunt. However, Jacob married two sisters and Amram married his aunt. According to I.E. they did so because they were outside of the Land of Israel. See I.E. on Lev. 18:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1875"><sup>42</sup> That the Land of Israel has special spiritual significance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1876"><sup>43</sup> That is, foreign people. Our verse reads, <italic>and go astray after the foreign gods of the land, whither they go to he among them</italic>. I.E. does not believe that Scripture would use the term &#x201C;among them&#x201D; when referring to foreign gods, for such gods do not exist, and it is impossible to come among them. Hence his interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1877"><sup>44</sup> The Canaanite nations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1878"><sup>45</sup> In other words, <italic>the foreign gods of the land</italic> is short for &#x201C;the foreign people of the gods of the land.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1879"><sup>46</sup> In this case <italic>be-kirbo</italic> should be translated as &#x201C;in it&#x201D; or &#x201C;into the midst of it&#x201D; and our verse rendered, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land into the midst of which they enter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1880"><sup>47</sup> Hence the word <italic>be-kirbo</italic> which is masculine, can refer to <italic>eretz. Eretz</italic> is usually feminine. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1881"><sup>48</sup> <italic>Nasa</italic> is masculine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1882"><sup>49</sup> <italic>Netam</italic> is masculine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1883"><sup>50</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ve-hayah</italic> (literally, and he shall be).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1884"><sup>51</sup> Hence the combination of the plural and the singular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1885"><sup>52</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>haster astir</italic> (I will surely hide). Literally, hide, I will hide.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1886"><sup>53</sup> That it is biblical style to employ an infinitive followed by a conjugated verb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1887"><sup>54</sup> Idol worship.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1888"><sup>55</sup> See I.E. on verse 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1889"><sup>56</sup> <italic>Kitvu</italic> (write) is in the plural. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1890"><sup>57</sup> Literally, that they should be proficient in it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1891"><sup>58</sup> Our word should have read <italic>ve-lamdeha</italic> rather than <italic>ve-lammedah</italic>. Similarly <italic>simah</italic> should have read <italic>simeha</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1892"><sup>59</sup> Our verse and the next one form one unit. The verses are to be read as follows: <italic>Now&#x2026;write ye this song&#x2026;that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel</italic> (v. 19), <italic>For when I shall have brought them into the land&#x2026;</italic> The song that is being discussed in these verses is the song in the following chapter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1893"><sup>60</sup> In other words, our verse is not tied to the verse that follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1894"><sup>61</sup> In this case, verse 20 opens a new thought and is tied to verse 21. The verses are to be read: <italic>For when I shall have brought them into the land&#x2026;</italic>(v. 20) <italic>that this song shall testify before them</italic> (v. 21).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1895"><sup>62</sup> That is, testify. In other words, <italic>ve-anetah</italic> does not mean will answer but rather will testify.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1896"><sup>63</sup> The song will explain to all why what occurred came to pass.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1897"><sup>64</sup> Israel shall always have a copy of the song with them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1898"><sup>65</sup> Supernaturally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1899"><sup>66</sup> And on this basis can surmise how they will act in the future.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1900"><sup>67</sup> In committing the song to writing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1901"><sup>68</sup> Hence the plural &#x201C;they were finished.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1902"><sup>69</sup> <italic>The Levites is short for the kohanim, the Levites</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1903"><sup>70</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation of <italic>that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1904"><sup>71</sup> See Deut. 3:18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1905"><sup>72</sup> You will rebel. According to I.E., <italic>ve-af ki achare moti</italic> (and how much more after my death) means, and how much more after my death will you rebel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1906"><sup>73</sup> After my death you will rebel.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 32</title>
<h1>HA&#x2019;AZINU</h1>
<p>1. GIVE EAR. I have previously explained in my book<sup><xref rid="fn1909">1</xref></sup> that the word <italic>ha&#x2019;azinu</italic> (give ear) is related to the word <italic>ozen</italic> (ear). Scripture, as it were, says incline your ear.<sup><xref rid="fn1910">2</xref></sup> I have previously informed you<sup><xref rid="fn1911">3</xref></sup> that the Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn1912">4</xref></sup> says that the meaning of <italic>heavens</italic> is the angels and the meaning of the <italic>earth</italic> is the people of the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn1913">5</xref></sup> On the other hand, its meaning might be that the rain that comes down from heaven and the fruit which the earth produces are called to bear witness.<sup><xref rid="fn1914">6</xref></sup> I believe that the correct interpretation is that Moses called heaven and earth to witness because they last forever.<sup><xref rid="fn1915">7</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>Hear, O ye mountains</italic> (Micah 6:2) and also Joshua&#x2019;s stone.<sup><xref rid="fn1916">8</xref></sup> Scripture there writes that the stone heard. I have hinted to you that man&#x2019;s soul is intermediary between the upper and lower worlds.<sup><xref rid="fn1917">9</xref></sup> The soul compares all things to its body.<sup><xref rid="fn1918">10</xref></sup> It certainly does so when speaking to other human beings.<sup><xref rid="fn1919">11</xref></sup> It therefore elevates the low and lowers the high.<sup><xref rid="fn1920">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. SHALL DROP. The word <italic>ya&#x2019;arof</italic> (shall drop) is related to the word <italic>ya&#x2019;arof</italic> (he will break down) in <italic>He will break down their altars</italic> (Hos. 10:2). The meaning of <italic>ya&#x2019;arof</italic> (shall drop) is will come down.</p>
<p>MY DOCTRINE. <italic>Likchi</italic> (My doctrine) refers to that which one will take away<sup><xref rid="fn1921">13</xref></sup> from him.<sup><xref rid="fn1922">14</xref></sup> It means a lesson. Compare, <italic>lekech</italic> (doctrine) in <italic>For I give you a good doctrine</italic> (Prov. 4:2).</p>
<p>AS THE SMALL RAIN. I believe that <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic> (small rain) refers to light rain.<sup><xref rid="fn1923">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND AS THE SHOWERS. The word <italic>revivim</italic> (showers) is related to the word <italic>rav</italic> (numerous). They<sup><xref rid="fn1924">16</xref></sup> are adjectives. The fact that <italic>esev</italic> (herb) is stronger than <italic>deshe</italic> (tender grass) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1925">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic> (small rain) is related to <italic>sa&#x2019;ar</italic> (hair).<sup><xref rid="fn1926">18</xref></sup> Others say that it is related to the word <italic>sa&#x2019;arat</italic> (storm of)<sup><xref rid="fn1927">19</xref></sup> in <italic>storm of God</italic> (Jer. 30:23) even though <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic> is spelled with a <italic>sin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1928">20</xref></sup> Similarly, the phrase <italic>ve-yista&#x2019;er alav</italic> (shall come against him like a whirlwind) (Dan. 11:40), which is spelled with a <italic>sin</italic>, means the same as <italic>ve-yista&#x2019;er alav</italic> spelled with a <italic>samekh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1929">21</xref></sup> It is also possible that the word <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic> has no brother in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1930">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our verse repeats itself<sup><xref rid="fn1931">23</xref></sup> for emphasis, as is the style in all prophecies.</p>
<p>The essence of our verse is that Moses prayed that his words be like dew and rain which, as it is written, do not return unfulfilled<sup><xref rid="fn1932">24</xref></sup> but water the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn1933">25</xref></sup> The meaning of the latter is that Moses&#x2019; words should enter the hearts of those who hear them in the same way that the rain affects the earth and fructifies it and causes it to produce plants.</p>
<p>3. ASCRIBE YE GREATNESS. This is addressed to the heavens and the earth, as Scripture states, <italic>The heavens declare the glory of God</italic> (Ps. 19:2), which is to be understood in accordance with my interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn1934">26</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>Let the heavens and earth praise Him</italic> (Ps. 69:35).</p>
<p>4. [THE ROCK, HIS WORK IS PERFECT.] Moses opens with this phrase to make it known that all that befell Israel did so because of their evil deeds.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>The Rock</italic> is that God, like a rock, is everlasting. Do not be amazed at this,<sup><xref rid="fn1935">27</xref></sup> for Scripture similarly states, <italic>The Lord&#x2026;shall roar like a lion</italic> (Hos. 11:10).<sup><xref rid="fn1936">28</xref></sup> Scripture does this because one who speaks cannot compare God&#x2019;s work to anything but His works, for everything is His work. Rock, in <italic>But God is the rock of my heart</italic> (Ps. 73:26), similarly means a support, might, and permanence.</p>
<p>Others say that <italic>tzur</italic> (rock) is related to the word <italic>tzurah</italic> (image). Compare, <italic>tzuram</italic> (their form) in <italic>And their form shall be for the nether-world</italic> (Ps. 49:15). Its basic meaning is that God does not consist of matter,<sup><xref rid="fn1937">29</xref></sup> which can be molded into a form.<sup><xref rid="fn1938">30</xref></sup> On the contrary, He is Primary form.<sup><xref rid="fn1939">31</xref></sup> The first interpretation appears correct to me.</p>
<p>HIS WORK IS PERFECT. All the works of an artisan are incomplete<sup><xref rid="fn1940">32</xref></sup> because the artisan needs the assistance of one greater than he.<sup><xref rid="fn1941">33</xref></sup> The work of God alone is perfect. Everything is a duality<sup><xref rid="fn1942">34</xref></sup> except for the creator of all.<sup><xref rid="fn1943">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR ALL HIS WAYS ARE JUSTICE. His ways do not change.<sup><xref rid="fn1944">36</xref></sup> On the contrary, they follow one law.<sup><xref rid="fn1945">37</xref></sup> This is the praise of God.<sup><xref rid="fn1946">38</xref></sup> All those who are created change their deeds in accordance with their needs.<sup><xref rid="fn1947">39</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s works<sup><xref rid="fn1948">40</xref></sup> were done for His glory,<sup><xref rid="fn1949">41</xref></sup> with might<sup><xref rid="fn1950">42</xref></sup> and wisdom.<sup><xref rid="fn1951">43</xref></sup> The standing still of the sun (Josh. 10:12)<sup><xref rid="fn1952">44</xref></sup> is no argument to the contrary because, as I explained in its place,<sup><xref rid="fn1953">45</xref></sup> its secret is clear, from the clause <italic>And thou, Moon in the valley of Aijalon</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1954">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>A GOD OF FAITHFULNESS AND WITHOUT INIQUITY. God alone has true might,<sup><xref rid="fn1955">47</xref></sup> for all the might of the mighty is an &#x201C;accident;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1956">48</xref></sup> that is, it depends on outside sources.<sup><xref rid="fn1957">49</xref></sup> The meaning of our clause is, it is not possible that God does iniquity because He is a God of faithfulness.<sup><xref rid="fn1958">50</xref></sup> It is possible that <italic>ve-en avel</italic> (and without iniquity) means and without iniquity in His ways.<sup><xref rid="fn1959">51</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is possible that the word <italic>El</italic> (God) is to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn1960">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>JUST AND RIGHT IS HE. Since Scripture states <italic>shichet lo</italic> (is corruption His) (v. 5),<sup><xref rid="fn1961">53</xref></sup> it says a perverse people corrupted God&#x2019;s righteousness.<sup><xref rid="fn1962">54</xref></sup> Look, God alone is right.<sup><xref rid="fn1963">55</xref></sup> The rightness of the right is to fix that which is crooked.<sup><xref rid="fn1964">56</xref></sup> The word <italic>lo</italic> (v. 5) therefore refers to what He had at first.<sup><xref rid="fn1965">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. NO; HIS CHILDREN&#x2019;S IS THE BLEMISH. <italic>Lo banav</italic> (no, his children&#x2019;s) means those who say that they are not his children. Scripture similarly states, <italic>Children in whom is no faithfulness</italic> (v. 20). Its meaning is that they do not admit that God created them. Although they might profess their belief verbally, they do not believe it in their hearts. The fact that they do not fear God<sup><xref rid="fn1966">58</xref></sup> is proof of their lack of belief. The <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>lo</italic> (his) serves itself and another word along with it. It is to be prefixed to the word <italic>mumam</italic> (the blemish).<sup><xref rid="fn1967">59</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>lemumam</italic> is, because of their blemish, their blemish consisting in being <italic>A generation crooked and perverse</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1968">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND PERVERSE. The meaning of <italic>u-fetaltol</italic> (and perverse) is he grows strong and triumphant in his crookedness.<sup><xref rid="fn1969">61</xref></sup> Compare the word <italic>naftule</italic> (wrestlings)<sup><xref rid="fn1970">62</xref></sup> in <italic>with mighty wrestlings</italic> (Gen. 30:8). Some say that the meaning of <italic>shichet lo</italic> (is corruption His) is, they corrupted themselves; that is, they corrupted their souls. Do not wonder that the singular <italic>lo</italic> is employed,<sup><xref rid="fn1971">63</xref></sup> for this is the style of the language. Can you not see that Scripture reads, <italic>Remember</italic> (zekhor)<sup><xref rid="fn1972">64</xref></sup> <italic>the days of old, Consider</italic> (binu)<sup><xref rid="fn1973">65</xref></sup> <italic>the years of many generations</italic> (v. 7).</p>
<p>I believe that <italic>shichet lo</italic> (is corruption His) means they corrupted God;<sup><xref rid="fn1974">66</xref></sup> that is, they corrupted the ways of God, which are implanted in man&#x2019;s mind,<sup><xref rid="fn1975">67</xref></sup> as well as the statutes which He commanded. Scripture, as it were, says the crooked generation that is not His children corrupted Him.<sup><xref rid="fn1976">68</xref></sup> This is their blemish. The verse that follows, namely, <italic>Do you thus requite the Lord</italic>, is proof that this is its interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn1977">69</xref></sup> I have explained the meaning of the <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1978">70</xref></sup> in the book entitled <italic>Moznayim</italic>.</p>
<p>6. FOOLISH. In their deeds.</p>
<p>AND UNWISE. In heart. Look, the entire people are totally deficient in thought and deed.</p>
<p>THY FATHER. Scripture states this because it earlier stated that they are not His children.</p>
<p>THAT HATH GOTTEN THEE. <italic>Kanekha</italic> (gotten thee) is similar to <italic>kanani</italic> (made me)<sup><xref rid="fn1979">71</xref></sup> in <italic>The Lord made me</italic> (Prov. 8:22).</p>
<p>HE&#x2026;MADE THEE. Fully developed you.<sup><xref rid="fn1980">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ESTABLISHED THEE.<sup><xref rid="fn1981">73</xref></sup> For full development.<sup><xref rid="fn1982">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THE DAYS OF. <italic>Yemot</italic> (days of) and <italic>yeme</italic> (days of) are two forms.<sup><xref rid="fn1983">75</xref></sup> The same is the case with <italic>shenot</italic> (years of) and <italic>shene</italic> (years of).<sup><xref rid="fn1984">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF OLD. <italic>Olam</italic> (of old) means the time that has past.</p>
<p>ASK THY FATHER. Scripture states this because it earlier<sup><xref rid="fn1985">77</xref></sup> said <italic>Remember</italic>. If you forgot what your fathers told you, ask them.</p>
<p>AND HE WILL DECLARE UNTO THEE. <italic>Ve-yaggedekha</italic> means and he will declare unto thee.<sup><xref rid="fn1986">78</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>netattani</italic> (thou hast given to me)<sup><xref rid="fn1987">79</xref></sup> in <italic>for that thou hast given to me in the Southland</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1988">80</xref></sup> (Josh. 15:19). And <italic>yetzauni</italic> (are gone forth of me) in <italic>My children are gone forth of me</italic> (Jer. 10:20).<sup><xref rid="fn1989">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>THINE ELDERS. Scripture repeats itself, for it is elegant to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn1990">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. WHEN THE MOST HIGH GAVE TO THE NATIONS THEIR INHERITANCE. The commentaries<sup><xref rid="fn1991">83</xref></sup> say that the reference is to &#x201C;the generation of the dispersion&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1992">84</xref></sup> when all the earth became inhabited.<sup><xref rid="fn1993">85</xref></sup> God at that time decreed that the land of the seven nations should belong to Israel, as this land would be large enough for them. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>According to the number of the children of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1994">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE SET. Some say that <italic>yatzev</italic> (he set) is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn1995">87</xref></sup> Compare the word <italic>dabber</italic> (speak)<sup><xref rid="fn1996">88</xref></sup> in <italic>behold, I cannot speak</italic> (Jer. 1:6). Others say that <italic>yatzev</italic> (he set) is a verb in the imperfect,<sup><xref rid="fn1997">89</xref></sup> employed as a perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn1998">90</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>ya&#x2019;asu</italic> (they made)<sup><xref rid="fn1999">91</xref></sup> in <italic>They made a calf in Horeb</italic> (Ps. 106:19). I believe that <italic>Ask thy father</italic> alludes to those &#x201C;who understand.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2000">92</xref></sup> The same applies to &#x201C;thy elders.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>the portion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2001">93</xref></sup> <italic>of the Lord is His people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2002">94</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>which the Lord thy God hath allotted</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2003">95</xref></sup> (Deut. 4:19), for every portion<sup><xref rid="fn2004">96</xref></sup> below<sup><xref rid="fn2005">97</xref></sup> has a portion<sup><xref rid="fn2006">98</xref></sup> above.<sup><xref rid="fn2007">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The rabbis, of blessed memory, say that the image of our father Jacob is engraved on the throne of glory.<sup><xref rid="fn2008">100</xref></sup> The latter is a great secret.<sup><xref rid="fn2009">101</xref></sup> <italic>For the portion of the Lord is His people</italic> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn2010">102</xref></sup> This is a very great status. God did not do this for any nation. Scripture therefore states, <italic>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise</italic>? (v. 6), that is, a people who have fallen from their status in their foolishness. Now, this God is your father, for he created you for His glory,<sup><xref rid="fn2011">103</xref></sup> and as Scripture goes on to explain,<sup><xref rid="fn2012">104</xref></sup> he taught you as a father teaches his son.</p>
<p>9. THE LOT. <italic>Chevel</italic> (lot) means a section.<sup><xref rid="fn2013">105</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>chavalim</italic> (the lines) (Ps. 16:6). A section is so called because land is measured with a cord.<sup><xref rid="fn2014">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. HE FOUND HIM. The reference is to <italic>thy father that hath gotten thee</italic> (v. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn2015">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>He found him</italic> is that God&#x2019;s glory entered into the desert with them. Furthermore, they were like a person wandering in the wilderness,<sup><xref rid="fn2016">108</xref></sup> a place where no man passes,<sup><xref rid="fn2017">109</xref></sup> for so Scripture states.<sup><xref rid="fn2018">110</xref></sup> The wilderness is a waste.</p>
<p>A HOWLING. A place where animals such as jackals and ostriches howl, and whoever hears their voices is astonished.<sup><xref rid="fn2019">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE COMPASSED HIM ABOUT. The reference is to the clouds.<sup><xref rid="fn2020">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE CARED FOR HIM. By giving him the Torah.</p>
<p>HE KEPT HIM. From the enemies.</p>
<p>AS THE APPLE OF HIS EYE. I have previously explained the meaning of <italic>ishon</italic> (apple).<sup><xref rid="fn2021">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture speaks as humans do when it says His eye.<sup><xref rid="fn2022">114</xref></sup> It means that God protected them from all enemies and all that lay in wait.<sup><xref rid="fn2023">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AS AN EAGLE THAT STIRRETH UP HER NEST. <italic>Ya&#x2019;ir</italic> (stirreth up) is a transitive verb.<sup><xref rid="fn2024">116</xref></sup> It means He leads them from place to place.<sup><xref rid="fn2025">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>HER YOUNG. <italic>Gozalav</italic> means her young. The word <italic>gozal</italic> (a young pigeon) in <italic>and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon</italic> (Gen. 15:9) is similar. The word <italic>gozal</italic>, along with the term <italic>efrochim</italic> (young birds), is a general term.<sup><xref rid="fn2026">118</xref></sup> It is similar to the term <italic>tzippor</italic> (bird).<sup><xref rid="fn2027">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>HOVERETH. When they journey.<sup><xref rid="fn2028">120</xref></sup> <italic>Yerachef</italic> (hovereth) is related to the word <italic>merachefet</italic> (hovered) (Gen. 1:2). The cloud acted similarly when Israel journeyed.<sup><xref rid="fn2029">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>SPREADETH ABROAD HER WINGS, TAKETH THEM.<sup><xref rid="fn2030">122</xref></sup> As an eagle takes each and every chick and bears it<sup><xref rid="fn2031">123</xref></sup> on her wing, for the chick does not have the strength to fly. This is the meaning of our verse.<sup><xref rid="fn2032">124</xref></sup> However, the meaning of <italic>how I bore you on eagles&#x2019; wings</italic> (Ex. 19:4) is connected to <italic>and brought you unto Myself</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). It means that Israel went out with a high hand<sup><xref rid="fn2033">125</xref></sup> and came quickly to Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn2034">126</xref></sup> It is similar in meaning to <italic>Who are these that fly as a cloud</italic> (Is. 60:8).</p>
<p>12. THE LORD ALONE DID LEAD THEM. <italic>Adonai badad</italic> (the Lord alone) means only the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn2035">127</xref></sup> Its meaning is<sup><xref rid="fn2036">128</xref></sup> similar to <italic>At the commandment of the</italic> Lord<sup><xref rid="fn2037">129</xref></sup> <italic>they encamped, and at the commandment of the Lord</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2038">130</xref></sup> <italic>they journeyed</italic> (Num. 9:23). God had no associate. It is possible that the word <italic>badad</italic> (alone) refers to Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2039">131</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone</italic> (Num. 23:9).</p>
<p>AND THERE WAS NO STRANGE GOD WITH HIM. With Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2040">132</xref></sup> <italic>They roused Him to jealousy with strange gods</italic> (v. 16) is proof that this interpretation is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn2041">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. HE MADE HIM RIDE ON THE HIGH PLACES OF THE EARTH. The land of Canaan, which is in the center of the inhabited world. <italic>He made him ride</italic> is metaphorical.</p>
<p>The reading of the word <italic>bamote</italic> (high places) does not change because of the <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2042">134</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>bamotemo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2043">135</xref></sup> (their high places) (Deut. 33:29). The word <italic>bemotav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2044">136</xref></sup> (with&#x2026;his tomb) in <italic>the wicked</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2045">137</xref></sup>&#x2026;<italic>with&#x2026;his tomb</italic> (Is. 53:9) is not related to our word.</p>
<p>FRUITAGE. The word <italic>tenuvot</italic> (fruitage) means fruit. It is related to the word <italic>yanuv</italic> (increase) in <italic>If riches increase</italic> (Ps. 62:11).</p>
<p>FIELD. <italic>Sadai</italic> (field) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn2046">138</xref></sup> It follows the paradigm of <italic>chakham</italic> (wise).<sup><xref rid="fn2047">139</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>sadai</italic> is in place of a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2048">140</xref></sup> It is similar to the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>shalev</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2049">141</xref></sup> (at ease) in <italic>I was at ease</italic> (Job 16:12). The clause <italic>ya&#x2019;aloz sadai</italic> (let the field exult) (Ps. 96:12) wherein <italic>ya&#x2019;aloz</italic> is in the singular proves this.<sup><xref rid="fn2050">142</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE MADE HIM TO SUCK HONEY OUT OF THE CRAG. This is a metaphor. It is like <italic>That the mountains shall drop down sweet wine</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2051">143</xref></sup> (Joel 4:18). The reference is to the abundance of honey and oil which, as is clearly stated in Scripture,<sup><xref rid="fn2052">144</xref></sup> were exported from the land of Canaan</p>
<p>OUT OF THE FLINTY ROCK. The <italic>lamed</italic> in <italic>chalmish</italic> (flinty) has no <italic>dagesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2053">145</xref></sup> because the word is in the construct. <italic>Me-chalmish tzur</italic> (out of the flinty rock) is the reverse of <italic>mi-tzur ha-challamish</italic> (out of the rock of flint) (Deut. 8:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2054">146</xref></sup> The same is true of <italic>charvot tzurim</italic> (knives of flint) <italic>and tzur charbo</italic> (his sword of flint)<sup><xref rid="fn2055">147</xref></sup> (Ps. 89:44).</p>
<p>14. CURD OF KINE. An abundance of meat.<sup><xref rid="fn2056">148</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND MILK OF SHEEP, WITH FAT OF LAMBS. Were it not for tradition<sup><xref rid="fn2057">149</xref></sup> then this verse<sup><xref rid="fn2058">150</xref></sup> would serve to support my opinion regarding the fat<sup><xref rid="fn2059">151</xref></sup> which I mentioned in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn2060">152</xref></sup> On the other hand, fat in <italic>with fat of lambs</italic> means the fleshy and the good.<sup><xref rid="fn2061">153</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>All the best</italic> (chelev)<sup><xref rid="fn2062">154</xref></sup> <italic>of the oil</italic> (Num. 18:12).<sup><xref rid="fn2063">155</xref></sup></p>
<p>OF THE BREED OF BASHAN. Who were raised in the mountain of the Bashan.</p>
<p>WITH THE KIDNEY-FAT OF WHEAT. This<sup><xref rid="fn2064">156</xref></sup> is metaphorical,<sup><xref rid="fn2065">157</xref></sup> for the fat lies on the kidneys.<sup><xref rid="fn2066">158</xref></sup> The kernel of wheat also<sup><xref rid="fn2067">159</xref></sup> looks like a kidney.</p>
<p>AND OF THE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE. The wine. The Land of Israel thus contains an abundance of honey, oil, meat, bread, wine, and all sorts of fruit. This is the meaning of <italic>the fruitage of the field</italic> (v. 13). Some say that honey refers to date honey.<sup><xref rid="fn2068">160</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOAMING WINE. The word <italic>chamer</italic> (foaming wine) means wine. Compare, <italic>kerem chemed</italic> (a vineyard of foaming wine) (Is. 27:2).</p>
<p>[THOU DRANKEST FOAMING WINE.]<sup><xref rid="fn2069">161</xref></sup> The <italic>tav</italic> of the word <italic>tishteh</italic> (thou drinkest) is a second person<sup><xref rid="fn2070">162</xref></sup> prefix. Our verse, as it were, speaks like a person who tells his friend the land has so much wine that you will drink it at all times.</p>
<p>Some say that <italic>enav</italic> (grape) is in the feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn2071">163</xref></sup> However, what they say is worthless, for the <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2072">164</xref></sup> should have been vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2073">165</xref></sup> so that it would be a causative. Some say that <italic>tishteh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2074">166</xref></sup> speaks of the community,<sup><xref rid="fn2075">167</xref></sup> for the word Israel is sometimes in the masculine and sometimes in the feminine. This interpretation is a bit closer to the correct meaning.</p>
<p>[15.] BUT JESHURUN WAXED FAT. Jeshurun refers to Israel. It is possible that the name <italic>Jeshurun</italic> is related to the word <italic>yashar</italic> (upright). Its meaning is, the one who was upright became fat. Some say that the word <italic>Jeshurun</italic> is related to the word <italic>ashurennu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2076">168</xref></sup> (I behold him) (Num. 23:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2077">169</xref></sup> The first interpretation appears &#x201C;upright&#x201D; in my eyes. The fact that Jeshurun is in the singular<sup><xref rid="fn2078">170</xref></sup> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn2079">171</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND KICKED. The word <italic>va-yivat</italic> (and kicked) is similar to <italic>tivatu</italic> (kick ye) in <italic>Wherefore kick ye</italic> (I Sam. 2:29). Its meaning is to be ascertained from its context.<sup><xref rid="fn2080">172</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU DIDST WAX FAT. It did not enter their minds to take stock of themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn2081">173</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU DIDST GROW THICK. The word <italic>avita</italic> (thou didst grow thick) is similar to the word <italic>avah</italic> (thicker) in <italic>My little finger is thicker</italic> (I Kings 12:10).</p>
<p>THOU DIDST BECOME GROSS. Some say that <italic>kasita</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2082">174</xref></sup> (thou didst grow thick) is similar to <italic>kissah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2083">175</xref></sup> (he hath covered) in <italic>he hath covered his face with his fatness</italic> (Job 15:27),<sup><xref rid="fn2084">176</xref></sup> for the word is found in the <italic>kal</italic> conjugation.<sup><xref rid="fn2085">177</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>kasita</italic> is similar to <italic>ke-seh</italic> (like&#x2026;a sheep) in <italic>I have gone astray like a lost sheep</italic> (Ps. 119:176).<sup><xref rid="fn2086">178</xref></sup> We do not find such a construction in any of the verbs.<sup><xref rid="fn2087">179</xref></sup> It appears to me the word <italic>kasita</italic> has no brother.<sup><xref rid="fn2088">180</xref></sup> Its meaning is, you kicked.</p>
<p>AND HE FORSOOK. The commandments of his God.</p>
<p>AND CONTEMNED. In mind and verbally. Its correct meaning is that Israel profaned the name of the Lord for not saving him. He caused this to be.<sup><xref rid="fn2089">181</xref></sup> Scripture therefore continues, <italic>the Rock of his salvation</italic>, which is to be understood as <italic>The Rock, His work is perfect</italic> (v. 4).<sup><xref rid="fn2090">182</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THEY ROUSED HIM. In their thoughts.<sup><xref rid="fn2091">183</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>and now nothing will he withheld from them</italic> (Gen. 11:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2092">184</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH STRANGE GODS. <italic>Be-zarim</italic> is to be interpreted as with strange gods.<sup><xref rid="fn2093">185</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH ABOMINATIONS. The reference is to idols.</p>
<p>17. DEMONS. <italic>Shedim</italic> (demons) has the same meaning as s<italic>e&#x2019;irim</italic> (satyrs) in <italic>the satyrs after whom they go astray</italic> (Lev. 17:7).<sup><xref rid="fn2094">186</xref></sup> Therefore Rabbi Isaac the son of Saul<sup><xref rid="fn2095">187</xref></sup> who rests in Eden says that the word <italic>se&#x2019;arum</italic> (dreaded) in <italic>Which your fathers dreaded not</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2096">188</xref></sup> is related to the word <italic>se&#x2019;irim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2097">189</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>la-shedim</italic> (unto demons) pertains to <italic>shedim</italic> and also to another word.<sup><xref rid="fn2098">190</xref></sup> <italic>La-shedim lo eloha</italic> (unto demons, no-gods) is to be read as if written <italic>la-shedim u-le-lo eloha</italic> (unto demons and unto no-gods).<sup><xref rid="fn2099">191</xref></sup> I believe that there is no need for this interpretation. On the contrary, the meaning of <italic>la-shedim lo eloha</italic> is clearly, unto demons who are no-gods. They are called <italic>shedim</italic> in the same way that the Emim are called Emim.<sup><xref rid="fn2100">192</xref></sup> They are called <italic>shedim</italic> because they destroy reason.<sup><xref rid="fn2101">193</xref></sup></p>
<p>GODS THAT THEY KNEW NOT. How could Israel think that these gods were deities when they did not know these gods by proof.<sup><xref rid="fn2102">194</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>they knew not</italic>. Neither did they know them by tradition. This is what <italic>Which your fathers dreaded not</italic> refers to.</p>
<p>NEW GODS THAT CAME UP OF LATE. A few days ago. They are not ancient. Even their fathers did not know them.</p>
<p>DREADED. <italic>Se&#x2019;arum</italic> means they were not in dread of them. <italic>Se&#x2019;arum</italic> is related to the word <italic>ve-yista&#x2019;er</italic> (shall come like a whirlwind) in <italic>shall come against him like a whirlwind</italic> (Dan. 11:40). It is similar in meaning to <italic>sa&#x2019;ar</italic> in <italic>That made the hair</italic> (sa&#x2019;arat)<sup><xref rid="fn2103">195</xref></sup> <italic>of my flesh to stand up</italic> (Job 4:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2104">196</xref></sup> However, it appears that <italic>se&#x2019;arum</italic> is related to the word <italic>sa&#x2019;arah</italic> (storm) even though the latter is spelled with a <italic>samekh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2105">197</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Se&#x2019;arum</italic> is similar to <italic>yetza&#x2019;uni</italic> (are gone forth of me)<sup><xref rid="fn2106">198</xref></sup> in <italic>My children are gone forth of me</italic> (Jer. 10:20) and in <italic>chazaktani</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2107">199</xref></sup> (Thou hast overcome me) in <italic>Thou hast overcome me, and hast prevailed</italic> (Jer. 20:7); that is, you are more powerful than me.<sup><xref rid="fn2108">200</xref></sup> Look, the meaning of <italic>se&#x2019;arum</italic> is, they were not afraid of them.</p>
<p>18. OF THE ROCK THAT BEGOT THEE THOU WAST UNMINDFUL. These are the words of the prophet.<sup><xref rid="fn2109">201</xref></sup> He wonders: How did you forget the One who begot you? You served new gods. Also, this clause,<sup><xref rid="fn2110">202</xref></sup> <italic>the</italic> <italic>rock that begot thee</italic>, is similar <italic>to Look unto the rock whence ye were hewn</italic> (Is. 51:1). Israel, as it were, came from God, for everything comes from God&#x2019;s might.<sup><xref rid="fn2111">203</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>That spread the earth by Myself</italic> (Is. 44:24). One must be amazed by those who err in their hearts<sup><xref rid="fn2112">204</xref></sup> because Scripture states, <italic>This day have I begotten thee</italic> (Ps. 2:7).<sup><xref rid="fn2113">205</xref></sup> They have forgotten this verse.<sup><xref rid="fn2114">206</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THOU WAST UNMINDFUL.] The word <italic>teshi</italic> (thou wast unmindful) is related to the word <italic>tinnasheh</italic> (you will forget)<sup><xref rid="fn2115">207</xref></sup> in [the clause] you shall not forget.<sup><xref rid="fn2116">208</xref></sup> The missing silent letter following the <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2117">209</xref></sup> is in place of the omitted <italic>dagesh</italic> which compensates for the first root letter, <sup><xref rid="fn2118">210</xref></sup> and the <italic>yod</italic> is in place of the <italic>heh</italic>. Compare the word <italic>temchi</italic> (blot out)<sup><xref rid="fn2119">211</xref></sup> in <italic>Neither blot out their sin</italic> (Jer. 18:23). Both words<sup><xref rid="fn2120">212</xref></sup> are accented penultimately in order to show a difference between the masculine and the feminine in verbs whose last letter is a silent <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2121">213</xref></sup> However, it appears to me that the <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2122">214</xref></sup> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn2123">215</xref></sup> It follows the same rule as <italic>tet</italic> (decline)<sup><xref rid="fn2124">216</xref></sup> does in <italic>neither decline</italic> (Prov. 4:5).</p>
<p>THAT BORE THEE. <italic>Mecholelekha</italic> means that bore thee. Observe, God who is powerful and mighty as a rock [gave birth to you]. It is possible that the word <italic>mecholelekha</italic> is related to the word <italic>chil</italic> (pain), as in <italic>Like as a woman with child</italic>, <italic>that draweth near the time of her delivery, Is in pain</italic> (tachil) (Is. 26:17).</p>
<p>[19. AND SPURNED.]<sup><xref rid="fn2125">217</xref></sup> Scripture similarly writes, <italic>veyanetz ha-shaked</italic> (And the almond-tree shall blossom) (Eccles. 12:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2126">218</xref></sup> On the other hand, it might be an intransitive verb.<sup><xref rid="fn2127">219</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIS SONS AND HIS DAUGHTERS. Men and women, for they too <sup><xref rid="fn2128">220</xref></sup> sacrificed to the idols.</p>
<p>20. AND HE SAID. God in His heart or to the angels.</p>
<p>I WILL HIDE MY FACE. Scripture speaks as people do.<sup><xref rid="fn2129">221</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>I will hide Mine eyes from you</italic> (Is. 1:15). It means<sup><xref rid="fn2130">222</xref></sup> that when they search for Me they will not find help.</p>
<p>I WILL SEE WHAT THEIR END WILL BE. Some say that our verse is to be interpreted, <italic>I will hide My face from them</italic> because I see what they will ultimately do.<sup><xref rid="fn2131">223</xref></sup> However, it is to be understood according to its literal meaning, that is, [so that] I will see what they will do when trouble comes upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn2132">224</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THEY ARE A VERY FROWARD GENERATION. This is connected to <italic>I will hide My face</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2133">225</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROWARD.<sup><xref rid="fn2134">226</xref></sup> They turned about and served gods besides Me. They were My children, for I gave birth to them. Look, there is no faithfulness in them. The word <italic>emun</italic> (faithfulness) is a noun. On the other hand, it might be an adjective<sup><xref rid="fn2135">227</xref></sup> meaning there is no faithful man among them, for we find <italic>for the faithful fail</italic> (Ps. 12:2)<sup><xref rid="fn2136">228</xref></sup> in which <italic>faithful</italic> is parallel to <italic>godly</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2137">229</xref></sup> <italic>We</italic> also find <italic>that keepeth faithfulness</italic> (emunim) (Is. 26:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2138">230</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. THEY HAVE ROUSED ME. The second root letter<sup><xref rid="fn2139">231</xref></sup> has no <italic>dagesh</italic> in order to simplify enunciation.</p>
<p>WITH A NO-GOD. Its meaning is, a god that has no power to deliver.<sup><xref rid="fn2140">232</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH THEIR VANITIES. Rather than with something which truly exists.</p>
<p>I WILL ROUSE THEM. <italic>Akni&#x2019;em</italic> (I will rouse them) is a <italic>hifil</italic>. It describes two actions.<sup><xref rid="fn2141">233</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH A NO-PEOPLE. A nation who are not My people. Scripture describes how God shall anger them.<sup><xref rid="fn2142">234</xref></sup> He will bring upon Israel, upon Israel alone, unique troubles which surpass the adversity that he brought upon all others.</p>
<p>A VILE NATION. For a fool and a vile person lack understanding. He therefore kills and has no pity.</p>
<p>22. KINDLED. Their provocation, or that which they did,<sup><xref rid="fn2143">235</xref></sup> for we find the word <italic>kadechah</italic> (kindled) to be transitive, as in <italic>For ye have kindled</italic> (kedachtem) <italic>a fire in My nostril</italic> (Jer. 17:4). It is possible that <italic>kadechah</italic> means is kindled.<sup><xref rid="fn2144">236</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>chaveru</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2145">237</xref></sup> (came as allies) (Gen. 14:3), the meaning of which is gathered. All of this<sup><xref rid="fn2146">238</xref></sup> refers to God&#x2019;s burning anger.</p>
<p>UNTO THE DEPTHS OF THE NETHER-WORLD. Its meaning is similar to that of <italic>and that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning</italic> (Deut. 29:22).</p>
<p>AND DEVOURETH. Israel.</p>
<p>AND SETTETH ABLAZE. <italic>Va-telahet</italic> (and setteth ablaze)<sup><xref rid="fn2147">239</xref></sup> is related to the word <italic>lahat</italic> (flaming) in <italic>and the flaming sword</italic> (Gen. 3:24).</p>
<p>THE MOUNTAINS. The mountains of Israel.</p>
<p>23. I WILL HEAP. Some say that the word <italic>aspeh</italic> (I will heap) means I will add. However, it really means I will consume.<sup><xref rid="fn2148">240</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>tispeh</italic> (sweep away) in <italic>Wilt Thou indeed sweep away</italic> (Gen. 18:23). The aforementioned is so, even though <italic>aspeh</italic> and <italic>tispeh</italic> differ in conjugation.<sup><xref rid="fn2149">241</xref></sup> It means<sup><xref rid="fn2150">242</xref></sup> that there will be no evil that will not come upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn2151">243</xref></sup> Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn2152">244</xref></sup> compares the evils to arrows that suddenly appear and there is no way to guard oneself against them.<sup><xref rid="fn2153">245</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. THE WASTING OF HUNGER. <italic>Meze ra&#x2019;av</italic> (the wasting of hunger) means burnt by hunger. <italic>Meze</italic> (wasting) is similar to <italic>le-meze</italic> (that they should heat) in <italic>that they should heat the furnace</italic> (Dan. 3:19).</p>
<p>AND THE DEVOURING OF THE FIERY BOLT. <italic>Le-chume reshef</italic> (the devouring of the fiery bolt) means consumed<sup><xref rid="fn2154">246</xref></sup> by birds.<sup><xref rid="fn2155">247</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>As the birds</italic> (bene reshef)<sup><xref rid="fn2156">248</xref></sup> <italic>fly upward</italic> (Job 5:7).<sup><xref rid="fn2157">249</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that Scripture mentions the four evil punishments. They are: <span class="underline">starvation</span>, which is what <italic>The wasting of hunger</italic> refers to; <italic>and the devouring of the fiery bolt, And bitter destruction</italic> refers to <span class="underline">the plague</span>; <italic>And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them</italic> refers to <span class="underline">the beast</span>: and finally [there is] <span class="underline">the sword</span>, as in <italic>Without shall the sword bereave</italic> (v. 25).</p>
<p><italic>Reshef</italic> (the fiery bolt) is thus similar to <italic>reshfeha rishpe esh</italic> (The flashes thereof are flashes of fire) (Cant. 8:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2158">250</xref></sup> It means that the air will grow hot.<sup><xref rid="fn2159">251</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND &#x2026;DESTRUCTION. <italic>Ketev</italic> means destruction.</p>
<p>BITTER. <italic>Meriri</italic> (bitter) refers to bitterness in the air. Compare, <italic>ke-meriri yom</italic> (like the bitterness of the day) (Job 3:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2160">252</xref></sup> Scripture similarly writes, <italic>Nor of the destruction</italic> (ketev) <italic>that wasteth at noonday</italic> (Ps. 91:6). The latter refers to the plague.</p>
<p>The word <italic>u-lechume</italic> in <italic>u-lechume reshef</italic> (and the devouring of the fiery bolt) means devoured by. There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2161">253</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH THE VENOM OF CRAWLING THINGS OF THE DUST. The reference is to being bitten. Venom<sup><xref rid="fn2162">254</xref></sup> refers to being bitten.</p>
<p>[DUST.] This refers to fiery snakes.<sup><xref rid="fn2163">255</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Zochale</italic> (crawling) is related to the word fear.<sup><xref rid="fn2164">256</xref></sup> They are called <italic>zochale</italic> because all who see them are afraid of them.<sup><xref rid="fn2165">257</xref></sup> It is similar to the term <italic>emim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2166">258</xref></sup> This is so because there are adjectives [without nouns].<sup><xref rid="fn2167">259</xref></sup> Its counterpart<sup><xref rid="fn2168">260</xref></sup> is found in the speech of Elihu the son of Barachel (Job 32:6).</p>
<p>25. BOTH YOUNG MAN. This<sup><xref rid="fn2169">261</xref></sup> is connected to <italic>Without shall the sword bereave</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2170">262</xref></sup> Scripture reads <italic>gam</italic> (both)<sup><xref rid="fn2171">263</xref></sup> in accordance with the rules of the Hebrew language, as I have previously explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2172">264</xref></sup> Look, the Torah includes<sup><xref rid="fn2173">265</xref></sup> all: young men, virgins, old men, and youths.</p>
<p>[26.] I WOULD MAKE AN END OF THEM. Some say that the word <italic>afehem</italic> (I would make an end of them) is a combination of three words.<sup><xref rid="fn2174">266</xref></sup> Actually, it has no neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn2175">267</xref></sup> Its meaning is, I will destroy them, for Scripture states afterwards, <italic>I would make their memory cease from among</italic> <italic>m</italic>en. Look, all of them will die.<sup><xref rid="fn2176">268</xref></sup> If the grammarians<sup><xref rid="fn2177">269</xref></sup> who say that <italic>afehem</italic> means I will scatter them to all the corners are right,<sup><xref rid="fn2178">270</xref></sup> then the idea expressed by the first part of the verse is not to be connected to that of the second.<sup><xref rid="fn2179">271</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that the meaning of <italic>afehem</italic> is, I will destroy them in my anger.<sup><xref rid="fn2180">272</xref></sup> Behold, the meaning of <italic>afehem</italic> is,<sup><xref rid="fn2181">273</xref></sup> I will destroy them.<sup><xref rid="fn2182">274</xref></sup> <italic>Afehem</italic> is similar in meaning to <italic>ashbitah</italic> (I would make&#x2026;cease). Scripture repeats itself.<sup><xref rid="fn2183">275</xref></sup> This interpretation<sup><xref rid="fn2184">276</xref></sup> would be correct were it not for the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>afehem</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2185">277</xref></sup> for the word should have read <italic>anfehem</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2186">278</xref></sup> meaning I will be angry at them. The first interpretation<sup><xref rid="fn2187">279</xref></sup> is correct.</p>
<p>[I THOUGHT.] The meaning of <italic>amarti</italic> (I thought) is, I said to Myself. The Torah speaks as people do.</p>
<p>27. I DREADED. <italic>Agur</italic> means I dreaded. It is related to the word <italic>va-yagar</italic> (was sore afraid) in <italic>And Moab was sore afraid</italic> (Num. 22:3). The Aramaic translation connects it to the word <italic>agerah</italic> (gathereth) in <italic>And gatherest&#x2026;in the harvest</italic> (Prov. 6:8).<sup><xref rid="fn2188">280</xref></sup> Actually it is related to the word <italic>tigrah</italic> (fight).<sup><xref rid="fn2189">281</xref></sup> Scripture speaks as people do so that those who hear will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn2190">282</xref></sup></p>
<p>SHOULD MISDEEM. <italic>Yenakkeru</italic> (misdeem)<sup><xref rid="fn2191">283</xref></sup> is the reverse of <italic>yakkiru</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2192">284</xref></sup> (they shall recognize).<sup><xref rid="fn2193">285</xref></sup> <italic>Yenakkeru</italic> is similar<sup><xref rid="fn2194">286</xref></sup> to <italic>va-yitnakker</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2195">287</xref></sup> (but made himself strange) in <italic>but made himself strange unto them</italic> (Gen. 42:7).</p>
<p>HATH WROUGHT ALL THIS. Upon the tribes.<sup><xref rid="fn2196">288</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. FOR THEY ARE A NATION VOID OF COUNSEL. The reference is to the enemies of Israel. This is its correct interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn2197">289</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>ovad</italic> (void) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn2198">290</xref></sup> It is in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn2199">291</xref></sup> It is therefore vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>bet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2200">292</xref></sup> It is known that the word <italic>ovad</italic> is an intransitive verb.<sup><xref rid="fn2201">293</xref></sup> The correct interpretation of <italic>ovad etzot</italic> is that <italic>etzot</italic> (counsel) reverts to <italic>ovad</italic> (void).<sup><xref rid="fn2202">294</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>novelet aleha</italic> (whose leaf fadeth)<sup><xref rid="fn2203">295</xref></sup> (Is. 1:30). The same is true of <italic>ve-tovedu derekh</italic> (and ye perish in the way) (Ps. 2:12)<sup><xref rid="fn2204">296</xref></sup> wherein <italic>tovedu</italic> is connected to <italic>derekh</italic>. The Aramaic translator who rendered <italic>ovad etzot</italic> as <italic>me&#x2019;abbede etzah</italic> (void of counsel) understood this.</p>
<p>29. IF THEY WERE WISE. If they were wise and understood that God did all of this to Israel because of all their sins, they would comprehend their eventual end, namely, that God would do so<sup><xref rid="fn2205">297</xref></sup> because of their sins.<sup><xref rid="fn2206">298</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. HOW SHOULD ONE CHASE. If Israel was wise<sup><xref rid="fn2207">299</xref></sup> they would understand how one of their enemies could pursue a thousand Israelites. This occurred only because their Rock has forsaken them. Others interpret our verse as how did Israel, who are now weak, at first pursue a thousand of their enemies.<sup><xref rid="fn2208">300</xref></sup></p>
<p>EXCEPT THEIR ROCK HAD GIVEN THEM OVER. <italic>Mekharam</italic> means had given them over.<sup><xref rid="fn2209">301</xref></sup> The same applies to <italic>yimkor</italic> (will give over) in <italic>for the Lord will give Sisera over</italic> (Jud. 4:9). Its meaning is that God, as it were, gave them over as in payment<sup><xref rid="fn2210">302</xref></sup> for their deeds. It is thus a literal sale.<sup><xref rid="fn2211">303</xref></sup></p>
<p>HAD DELIVERED THEM UP. <italic>Hisgiram</italic> (had delivered them up) is similar to <italic>yisgor</italic> (shutteth up) in, <italic>He shutteth up a man</italic> (Job 12:14).<sup><xref rid="fn2212">304</xref></sup> On the other hand, it might be similar to <italic>hasgiro</italic> (deliver him up) in <italic>and our part shall be to deliver him up</italic> (I Sam. 23:20).</p>
<p>31. FOR THEIR ROCK IS NOT AS OUR ROCK. These are the words of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2213">305</xref></sup> Moses explains <italic>for they</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2214">306</xref></sup> <italic>are a nation void of counsel</italic> (v. 28). It means that our Rock<sup><xref rid="fn2215">307</xref></sup> has handed us over, and the nations have no rock like our Rock, and they are no better than we<sup><xref rid="fn2216">308</xref></sup> are.<sup><xref rid="fn2217">309</xref></sup> Scripture similarly states, and our enemies are not judges.<sup><xref rid="fn2218">310</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And I have not learned wisdom</italic> (Prov. 30:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2219">311</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that the meaning of <italic>Even our enemies themselves being judges</italic> is as follows: our enemies admit this.<sup><xref rid="fn2220">312</xref></sup> It is therefore not connected to<sup><xref rid="fn2221">313</xref></sup> <italic>For their vine is of the vine of Sodom</italic> (v. 32).<sup><xref rid="fn2222">314</xref></sup></p>
<p>[32.] AND OF THE FIELDS OF GOMORRAH. Scripture repeats itself.<sup><xref rid="fn2223">315</xref></sup> The same is true of <italic>Their clusters are bitter</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2224">316</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. THE VENOM OF. Look, the wine<sup><xref rid="fn2225">317</xref></sup> is like the venom of angry serpents.<sup><xref rid="fn2226">318</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE CRUEL POISON OF ASPS. <italic>Petanim</italic> (asps) is similar to the word <italic>paten</italic> (asp) in <italic>on the hole of the asp</italic> (Is. 11:8). Even though <italic>rosh</italic> (poison) is spelled with an <italic>alef</italic>, it has the same meaning as its counterparts which are spelled with a <italic>vav.<sup><xref rid="fn2227">319</xref></sup></italic></p>
<p>CRUEL. <italic>Akhzar</italic> (cruel) means mighty.<sup><xref rid="fn2228">320</xref></sup> The <italic>alef</italic> is superfluous,<sup><xref rid="fn2229">321</xref></sup> like the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>etzba</italic> (finger)<sup><xref rid="fn2230">322</xref></sup> and <italic>ezro&#x2019;a</italic> (arm).<sup><xref rid="fn2231">323</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. IS NOT THIS LAID UP IN STORE WITH ME. These are the words of God. Some say the reference is to the decrees.<sup><xref rid="fn2232">324</xref></sup> It appears to me that the reference is to their wine, which is the poison of asps. It is laid in store<sup><xref rid="fn2233">325</xref></sup> until they drink it.<sup><xref rid="fn2234">326</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of the word <italic>kamus</italic> (laid up in store) is to be ascertained from its context, for it has no family.<sup><xref rid="fn2235">327</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEALED UP IN MY TREASURIES. So that no hand touches it. It is kept for them,<sup><xref rid="fn2236">328</xref></sup> for vengeance is to be exacted from them.</p>
<p>35. VENGEANCE IS MINE, AND RECOMPENSE. <italic>Shillem</italic> (recompense) is a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn2237">329</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>kitter</italic> (offering)<sup><xref rid="fn2238">330</xref></sup> in <italic>The offering&#x2026;did not</italic> (Jer. 44:21). It means<sup><xref rid="fn2239">331</xref></sup> that <italic>Vengeance is mine</italic>, and mine is the recompense to compensate them in accordance with their deeds.</p>
<p>AGAINST THE TIME WHEN THEIR FOOT SHALL SLIP. It means<sup><xref rid="fn2240">332</xref></sup> they will fall and be unable to stand.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>Against the time</italic> is similar to that of <italic>Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil</italic> (Prov. 16:4). It is a great secret.<sup><xref rid="fn2241">333</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THE DAY OF THEIR CALAMITY IS AT HAND. Let them not think that the vengeance will be exacted from their children.<sup><xref rid="fn2242">334</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE THINGS THAT ARE TO COME UPON THEM SHALL MAKE HASTE. <italic>Ve-chash atidot lamo</italic> (and the things that are to come upon them shall make haste) means each one of the future events that are to come upon them shall make haste.<sup><xref rid="fn2243">335</xref></sup> It is like <italic>Its branches</italic> (banot)<sup><xref rid="fn2244">336</xref></sup> <italic>run</italic> (tza&#x2019;adah)<sup><xref rid="fn2245">337</xref></sup> <italic>over the wall</italic> (Gen. 49:22).<sup><xref rid="fn2246">338</xref></sup> Or the meaning of <italic>ve-chash atidot lamo</italic> is, the day (<italic>yom</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2247">339</xref></sup> when the future things that are to come upon them makes haste.<sup><xref rid="fn2248">340</xref></sup> The first interpretation is correct.</p>
<p>The word <italic>chash</italic> (make haste) comes from a root in which only two letters are present.<sup><xref rid="fn2249">341</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>the things that are to come</italic> is, the evil things that are about to come.</p>
<p>36. FOR THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE. God will exact judgment from Israel&#x2019;s enemies on behalf of His people. It is like <italic>Be Thou my judge, O God, and plead my cause</italic> (Ps. 43:1).<sup><xref rid="fn2250">342</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND REPENT HIMSELF. I have previously explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn2251">343</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEIR STAY IS GONE. The stay of Israel. <italic>Yad</italic> (stay) means the strength. The <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>azelat</italic> is in place of a <italic>heh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2252">344</xref></sup> for both the <italic>heh</italic> and the <italic>tav</italic> are signs of the feminine. The word <italic>ve-shavat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2253">345</xref></sup> (then it shall return) in <italic>then it shall return to the prince</italic> is similar (Ezek. 46:17).</p>
<p>AND THERE IS NONE REMAINING, SHUT UP OR LEFT AT LARGE. When the captives are numerous, the captors take some of them and leave others, but in this case almost all are lost.<sup><xref rid="fn2254">346</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. AND IT IS SAID.<sup><xref rid="fn2255">347</xref></sup> And the enemy shall say.</p>
<p>THE ROCK IN WHOM THEY TRUSTED. This is to be understood in accordance with my previous interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn2256">348</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. WHO DID EAT. Scripture employs the language of the enemies<sup><xref rid="fn2257">349</xref></sup> who thought that the burnt offerings serve as food for God. Scripture employs the plural as they do.<sup><xref rid="fn2258">350</xref></sup> The Torah therefore states, <italic>I</italic>, only <italic>I, am He, And there is no god with Me</italic> (v. 39).</p>
<p>THE WINE OF THEIR DRINK-OFFERING. <italic>Yen nesikham</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2259">351</xref></sup> (the wine of their drink-offering) is similar to <italic>venisko</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2260">352</xref></sup> <italic>yayin</italic> (and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine) (Lev. 23:13). They are two terms.<sup><xref rid="fn2261">353</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that <italic>yen nesikham</italic> (the wine of their drink-offering) means the wine of their king,<sup><xref rid="fn2262">354</xref></sup> for the kings used to donate the wine for the burnt offering. Compare, <italic>nesikhe midian</italic> (the princes of Midian) (Josh. 13:21).<sup><xref rid="fn2263">355</xref></sup> The first interpretation appears correct to me.</p>
<p>AND HELP YOU. <italic>Ve-yazrukhem</italic> (and help you) is similar to <italic>berakhnukhem</italic> (we bless you) (Ps. 119:26).<sup><xref rid="fn2264">356</xref></sup></p>
<p>If you<sup><xref rid="fn2265">357</xref></sup> say that the Lord alone is God<sup><xref rid="fn2266">358</xref></sup> then let Him<sup><xref rid="fn2267">359</xref></sup> protect you from the coming troubles.<sup><xref rid="fn2268">360</xref></sup></p>
<p>39. I, EVEN I.<sup><xref rid="fn2269">361</xref></sup> The word <italic>I</italic> is written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn2270">362</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>I, even I</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2271">363</xref></sup> (Is. 51:12). On the other hand, its<sup><xref rid="fn2272">364</xref></sup> meaning might be, I am He, and I do not change.<sup><xref rid="fn2273">365</xref></sup> The latter is the correct interpretation, for God has no co-worker.<sup><xref rid="fn2274">366</xref></sup> I am He that put Israel to death, and I will bring them back to life. Look, they were not saved.<sup><xref rid="fn2275">367</xref></sup> There is none that can deliver you out of My hand, even you out of My hand,<sup><xref rid="fn2276">368</xref></sup> until I execute My judgment upon you.</p>
<p>Many say that we can derive the existence of life in the future world from this verse.<sup><xref rid="fn2277">369</xref></sup> They offer proof from the fact that Scripture first states, <italic>I kill</italic> and then, <italic>I make alive</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2278">370</xref></sup> It similarly reads, <italic>The Lord killeth, and maketh alive</italic> (I Sam. 2:6). <italic>He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up (Ibid.</italic>) is proof.<sup><xref rid="fn2279">371</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Others offer proof<sup><xref rid="fn2280">372</xref></sup> from: And surely your blood of your lives (nafshotekhem)<sup><xref rid="fn2281">373</xref></sup> will I require (Gen. 9:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2282">374</xref></sup> Also from And it shall be righteousness unto us (Deut. 6:25);<sup><xref rid="fn2283">375</xref></sup> for that is thy life</italic> (Deut. 30:20) in the world to come,<sup><xref rid="fn2284">376</xref></sup> <italic>and the length of thy days (Ibid.</italic>) in this world;<sup><xref rid="fn2285">377</xref></sup> <italic>that it may go well with thee</italic> (Deut. 5:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2286">378</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Hai Gaon, of blessed memory, says that Scripture had no need to state clearly that a future world exists because it was known by tradition.</p>
<p>I believe that [Scripture does not speak of a future world] because the Torah was given to all. It was not given to an individual alone. The topic of the world to come is not comprehended by even one in a thousand, for it is very abstruse. The reward in the world to come is contingent on the nature of the soul.<sup><xref rid="fn2287">379</xref></sup> The reward<sup><xref rid="fn2288">380</xref></sup> is given for the service of the heart.<sup><xref rid="fn2289">381</xref></sup> The latter consists in comprehending the works of God,<sup><xref rid="fn2290">382</xref></sup> for they are the ladder whereon one ascends to the level of understanding the knowledge of God, which is what is most important. Observe, the Torah itself explains to the intelligent the topic of the tree of life.<sup><xref rid="fn2291">383</xref></sup> Behold, there is a power by which one can overcome the cherubim.<sup><xref rid="fn2292">384</xref></sup> The one who eats from the tree of life<sup><xref rid="fn2293">385</xref></sup> gains eternal life like the ministering angels.</p>
<p>The psalm of the sons of Korah similarly reads, <italic>Hear this, all ye peoples&#x2026;</italic>(Ps. 49:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2294">386</xref></sup> The secret<sup><xref rid="fn2295">387</xref></sup> is <italic>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether-world; For He shall receive</italic> (take) <italic>me. Selah</italic> (Ps. 49:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2296">388</xref></sup> Scripture similarly states, <italic>And afterward receive</italic> (take) me <italic>with glory</italic> (Ps. 73:24). Both verses employ the word &#x201C;taking&#x201D; as Scripture does in the account of Enoch<sup><xref rid="fn2297">389</xref></sup> and Elijah.<sup><xref rid="fn2298">390</xref></sup> Now, since Scripture states, <italic>But God will redeem my soul</italic> [<italic>from the power of the netherworld</italic>] (Ps. 49:16), how could it say, <italic>For too costly is the redemption of their soul</italic> (Ps. 49:9)?<sup><xref rid="fn2299">391</xref></sup> The intelligent will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn2300">392</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. FOR I LIFT UP MY HAND TO HEAVEN. An oath taken over something which is everlasting.<sup><xref rid="fn2301">393</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>For I lift</italic> is similar to <italic>when he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swore by Him that liveth for ever</italic> (Dan. 12:7). The term <italic>I lift up</italic> is an anthropomorphism<sup><xref rid="fn2302">394</xref></sup> so those who hear will understand.</p>
<p>AS I LIVE FOR EVER. As I live so will I do this.</p>
<p>41. IF I WHET. <italic>Shannoti</italic> (I whet) comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn2303">395</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>channoti</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2304">396</xref></sup> (I am loathsome) in <italic>And I am loathsome to the children of my tribe</italic> (Job 19:17). <italic>Shannoti</italic> is related<sup><xref rid="fn2305">397</xref></sup> to the word <italic>shanun</italic> (sharp) in <italic>and a sharp arrow</italic> (Prov. 25:18).</p>
<p>AND MY HAND TAKE HOLD ON JUDGMENT. The sword is the instrument by which the warrior executes judgment.<sup><xref rid="fn2306">398</xref></sup></p>
<p>I WILL RENDER VENGEANCE TO MINE ADVERSARIES. The meaning of <italic>ashiv</italic> (I will render) is, I will do to <italic>Mine adversaries</italic> as they did to Israel. This is also the meaning of <italic>And will recompense</italic> (ashallem).</p>
<p>[42.] WITH THE BLOOD OF THE SLAIN. This explains <italic>I will make Mine arrows drunk</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2307">399</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE CAPTIVES.] It means the wounded.<sup><xref rid="fn2308">400</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM THE&#x2026;HEADS. This explains <italic>shall devour flesh</italic>. It means that the head shall be chopped off.<sup><xref rid="fn2309">401</xref></sup></p>
<p>LONG-HAIRED. The word <italic>parot</italic> (long-haired) is similar to <italic>bi-fero&#x2019;a pera&#x2019;ot</italic> (When men let grow their hair) (Jud. 5:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2310">402</xref></sup> The rabbis also employ the term <italic>ha-nifra</italic> (one who collects).<sup><xref rid="fn2311">403</xref></sup></p>
<p>43. SING ALOUD, O YE NATIONS. Then, when God avenges Israel&#x2019;s blood, the nations will praise Him.<sup><xref rid="fn2312">404</xref></sup> Some say that the meaning of <italic>harninu</italic> (sing aloud) is similar to the word <italic>rinnah</italic> (cry) in <italic>And there went a cry</italic> (I Kings 22:36). It means the herald.<sup><xref rid="fn2313">405</xref></sup> Proclaim about them in every place where they are.<sup><xref rid="fn2314">406</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND DOTH MAKE EXPIATION FOR THE LAND OF HIS PEOPLE. Some say that a <italic>vav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2315">407</xref></sup> is missing.<sup><xref rid="fn2316">408</xref></sup> Our verse should be interpreted as if written <italic>ve-khipper admato ve-ammo</italic> (and doth make expiation for His land and for His people). According to the midrash<sup><xref rid="fn2317">409</xref></sup> the meaning of <italic>ve-khipper admato ammo</italic> (and doth make expiation for His land of His people) is that the land makes expiation for His people.<sup><xref rid="fn2318">410</xref></sup> This interpretation is true in itself.<sup><xref rid="fn2319">411</xref></sup> However, it is not the meaning of the verse.<sup><xref rid="fn2320">412</xref></sup> Furthermore, the word <italic>adamah</italic> (land) is a feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn2321">413</xref></sup> The <italic>heh</italic> at its end<sup><xref rid="fn2322">414</xref></sup> is proof of this. The <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2323">415</xref></sup> takes the place of the <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2324">416</xref></sup> Now, Scripture does not read <italic>vekhipperah</italic> (and doth make expiation).<sup><xref rid="fn2325">417</xref></sup></p>
<p>In my opinion the meaning of our clause is that the people will make expiation for the land,<sup><xref rid="fn2326">418</xref></sup> for we find Scripture stating, <italic>avanim shachaku mayim</italic> (The waters wear the stones) (Job 14:19).<sup><xref rid="fn2327">419</xref></sup> The word <italic>kippur</italic> (expiate) is also found without the word <italic>al</italic> (for),<sup><xref rid="fn2328">420</xref></sup> as in <italic>ve-khippartahu</italic> (and make atonement for it)<sup><xref rid="fn2329">421</xref></sup> in, <italic>thus shalt thou purify it and make atonement for it</italic> (Ezek. 43:20). The meaning of <italic>ve-khipper admato ammo</italic> is that Israel will execute vengeance upon the nations and they will make atonement for the Land of Israel because of the blood that was shed in it. Compare, <italic>and no expiation can be made for the land</italic> [<italic>for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it</italic>] (Num. 35:33). This interpretation is in keeping with the meaning of the context.<sup><xref rid="fn2330">422</xref></sup> On the other hand, the meaning of <italic>ve-khipper</italic> (and doth make expiation) is, and will purify, as in <italic>ve-khippartahu</italic> (and make atonement for it) (Ezek. 43:20). Ezekiel similarly said, regarding the end of the wars,<sup><xref rid="fn2331">423</xref></sup> <italic>Thus shall they cleanse the land</italic> (Ezek. 39:16). Israel will thus purify the land.<sup><xref rid="fn2332">424</xref></sup></p>
<p>44. AND MOSES CAME. Our verse teaches that after Moses went to each one of the tribes and charged them,<sup><xref rid="fn2333">425</xref></sup> when he came to the tent of meeting and all of the children of Israel were gathered unto him, he spoke the words of this song.<sup><xref rid="fn2334">426</xref></sup></p>
<p>HE, AND HOSHEA THE SON OF NUN. This is similar to <italic>Then sang Moses and the children of Israel</italic> (Ex. 15:1).<sup><xref rid="fn2335">427</xref></sup> Also, this<sup><xref rid="fn2336">428</xref></sup> was done to exalt the status of Joshua in the eyes of all. Scripture refers to Joshua by the name of Hoshea because it was the name by which he was known to all of Israel, for who aside from the elect of the assembly knew that Moses referred to Hoshea by the name of Joshua. The approach of the midrash<sup><xref rid="fn2337">429</xref></sup> is known.<sup><xref rid="fn2338">430</xref></sup></p>
<p>47. BECAUSE IT IS YOUR LIFE. Its meaning is similar to that of <italic>The fear of the Lord prolongeth days</italic> (Prov. 10:27). Furthermore, you shall be in a good land and not in exile.</p>
<p>48. THAT SELFSAME DAY. The day that he delivered the song.<sup><xref rid="fn2339">431</xref></sup></p>
<p>50. AND DIE. To prepare himself for death, for Moses, as I will explain, was to bury himself.<sup><xref rid="fn2340">432</xref></sup> I have hinted earlier what one of the wise men of the generation said regarding the word <italic>va-ye&#x2019;asef</italic> (and was gathered) (Gen. 25:8).<sup><xref rid="fn2341">433</xref></sup></p>
<p>51. BECAUSE YE SANCTIFIED ME NOT. I have previously explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn2342">434</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn2185"><sup>277</sup> <italic>Afehem</italic> is spelled with an <italic>alef</italic> following the <italic>feh</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn2219"><sup>311</sup> The verse continues, and I have knowledge of the Holy One.

<ftnote id="fn2220"><sup>312</sup> That their rock is not like our Rock.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2221"><sup>313</sup> Unlike the first interpretation. According to the first interpretation our verse reads, and our enemies are not our judges. This leads into, <italic>For their vine is of the vine of Sodom</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2290"><sup>382</sup> The reference appears to be to the sciences. &#x201C;Man&#x2019;s soul is unique. When given by God, it is like a tablet set before a scribe. When God&#x2019;s writing, which consists of the categorical knowledge of the things made out of the four elements, the knowledge of the spheres, the throne of glory, the secret of the chariot, and the knowledge of the Most High, is inscribed on this tablet the soul cleaves to God the Glorious while it is yet in man and also afterward when its power is removed from the body.&#x201D; (<italic>Yesod Mora</italic>, Chapter 10, p. 143.

<title>CHAPTER 33</title>
<h1>VE-ZOT HA-BERAKHAH</h1>
<p>1. AND THIS IS THE BLESSING. This blessing is similar to the blessing of Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2344">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE MAN OF GOD. This teaches that Moses blessed them prophetically.</p>
<p>BEFORE HIS DEATH. Close to his death. This means on the day of his death.<sup><xref rid="fn2345">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. CAME FROM SINAI. The Gaon,<sup><xref rid="fn2346">3</xref></sup> of blessed memory, says that Mount Sinai, Seir, and Paran are close to each other.<sup><xref rid="fn2347">4</xref></sup> This verse speaks of the revelation at Sinai. Scripture reads <italic>mi-sinai</italic> (from Sinai), for <italic>mi-sinai</italic> has the same meaning as <italic>be-sinai</italic> (on Sinai).<sup><xref rid="fn2348">5</xref></sup> The same applies to the term <italic>mise&#x2019;ir</italic> (from Seir).<sup><xref rid="fn2349">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM THE MYRIADS HOLY. The reference is to the angels. Scripture speaks of the Divine presence, which descended.<sup><xref rid="fn2350">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A FIERY LAW UNTO THEM. The Torah, which was given through fire and lightning.<sup><xref rid="fn2351">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>He<sup><xref rid="fn2352">9</xref></sup> says that the <italic>Lord came&#x2026;</italic>is a prayer. It means, You who came to Sinai and bequeathed the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn2353">10</xref></sup> <italic>Let Reuben live</italic> (v. 6). However, this interpretation is far-fetched, for Scripture should read, keep Reuben alive and do not put him to death.<sup><xref rid="fn2354">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those who lack faith say that <italic>from Seir</italic> refers to the religion of the Edomites,<sup><xref rid="fn2355">12</xref></sup> and Paran refers to the faith of the Ishmaelites.<sup><xref rid="fn2356">13</xref></sup> However, these err. Do they not see that Moses commenced at first to bless Israel alone. Scripture thus reads, <italic>wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel</italic> (v. 1). Scripture goes on to say <italic>ve-zarach mi-se&#x2019;ir lamo</italic>, the meaning of which is, And rose from Seir unto them.<sup><xref rid="fn2357">14</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>lamo</italic> (for them) in <italic>And there is no stumbling for them</italic> (Ps. 119:165).<sup><xref rid="fn2358">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that this chapter is a general blessing to all of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2359">16</xref></sup> Moses then goes on to address each tribe and tribe individually.<sup><xref rid="fn2360">17</xref></sup> Then Moses includes them all in the verse which reads, <italic>There is none unto God, O Jeshurun</italic> (v. 26).</p>
<p>Look,<sup><xref rid="fn2361">18</xref></sup> we find that Deborah said, <italic>Lord, when Thou didst go forth out of Seir, When Thou didst march out of the field of Edom, The earth trembled</italic> (Jud. 5:4). Clearly the field of Edom is not a mountain as the Gaon says,<sup><xref rid="fn2362">19</xref></sup> for the Gaon maintains that Sinai, Seir, and Paran are three mountains close to each other or facing each other. Also, the Book of Psalms states, <italic>O God, when Thou wentest forth before thy people, When Thou didst march through the wilderness</italic> (yeshimon); <italic>Selah</italic> (Ps. 68:8). Scripture then states, <italic>The earth trembled</italic> (Ps. 68:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2363">20</xref></sup> Now the Divine presence did not march through the wilderness (<italic>yeshimon</italic>) on the day that the Torah was given, for Israel came to the wilderness (<italic>yeshimon</italic>) after they had passed through the wilderness (<italic>midbar</italic>) of Paran.<sup><xref rid="fn2364">21</xref></sup> Furthermore, Habakkuk says, <italic>God cometh from Teman</italic> (Hab. 3:3). Teman was one of the sons of Edom, for we read, <italic>Teman, Omar</italic> (Gen. 36:11).<sup><xref rid="fn2365">22</xref></sup> <italic>From Teman</italic> means the same as <italic>from the field of Edom</italic>. Look, all the verses<sup><xref rid="fn2366">23</xref></sup> speak of war. <italic>Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered</italic> (Ps. 68:2) is proof of this. Scripture describes God&#x2019;s saving of His servants in terms of help coming down from heaven, the earth melting, the mountains dissolving, and the heavens quaking. <italic>Then the earth did shake and quake</italic> (Ps. 18:8) in David&#x2019;s song is proof of this. I have explained the meaning of <italic>even yon Sinai</italic> (Ps. 68:9) in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn2367">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following is the explanation of our verse. <italic>The Lord came</italic> refers to the glory that entered into Israel. It first entered Israel at Sinai. <italic>And rose from Seir</italic> means that God did not show His might among the nations all the years that Israel was in the wilderness until Israel came to the field of Edom. Scripture similarly states, <italic>in their mount Seir, unto El-paran</italic> (Gen. 14:6). Seir and Paran are thus close to each other.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>And rose from Se&#x2019;ir</italic> is thus explained, for <italic>mi-seir</italic> means from the place of Seir; that is, when Israel came to Seir, God&#x2019;s glory rose to Israel. <italic>He shined forth from mount Paran</italic> repeats the idea expressed by <italic>and rose from Seir</italic>. It means that God here<sup><xref rid="fn2368">25</xref></sup> showed His shining.</p>
<p>AND HE CAME FROM THE MYRIADS HOLY. I believe that this is connected to <italic>At His right hand</italic>. It means that fire came <italic>from the myriads holy</italic> at God&#x2019;s right hand to surround Israel. It<sup><xref rid="fn2369">26</xref></sup> is similar to the <italic>horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha</italic> (II Kings 6:17).</p>
<p>[FIERY LAW.] The meaning of <italic>law</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2370">27</xref></sup> is something constant.<sup><xref rid="fn2371">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. YEA, HE LOVETH THE PEOPLES. <italic>Hovev</italic> (loveth) comes from an Aramaic word. It<sup><xref rid="fn2372">29</xref></sup> has the meaning of <italic>then ye shall be Mine own treasure from among all peoples</italic> (Ex. 19:5). <italic>The peoples refers to Israel. Compare, After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples (Jud. 5:14); They shall call peoples unto the mountain (v. 19</italic>).</p>
<p>[ALL HIS HOLY ONES.] This refers to the sons of Levi.</p>
<p>THEY ARE IN THY HAND. They are round about the ark.</p>
<p>AND THEY SIT DOWN AT THY FEET. This means they will walk in Your ways. The meaning of <italic>in Thy hand</italic> is, you will protect them.<sup><xref rid="fn2373">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>RECEIVING OF THY WORDS. They<sup><xref rid="fn2374">31</xref></sup> will teach Torah. They are the ones who transmit the oral Torah.</p>
<p>RECEIVING.<sup><xref rid="fn2375">32</xref></sup> Each and every one.<sup><xref rid="fn2376">33</xref></sup> This is so even though they are many.<sup><xref rid="fn2377">34</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>Thy words</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2378">35</xref></sup> is, that which You spoke they will bear,<sup><xref rid="fn2379">36</xref></sup> for they are the bearers of the Torah, and they also carry the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn2380">37</xref></sup> The word <italic>yissa</italic> (receiving) is similar to <italic>tissa</italic> (uttering) in <italic>Thou shalt not utter a false report</italic> (Ex. 23:1).</p>
<p>AND THEY SIT DOWN. <italic>Tukku</italic> (sit down) has no brother.<sup><xref rid="fn2381">38</xref></sup> Some say<sup><xref rid="fn2382">39</xref></sup> that it is related to the word <italic>mi-tokh</italic> (from the midst of).<sup><xref rid="fn2383">40</xref></sup> They, as it were, walk in the midst of Your feet. Others say that the <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2384">41</xref></sup> is in place of a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2385">42</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>tirgalti</italic> (I taught)<sup><xref rid="fn2386">43</xref></sup> in <italic>I taught Ephraim</italic> (Hos. 11:3). The meaning of our verse is, even if they are beaten on Your account, they will not forsake Your words. However, this is farfetched. Actually it means are drawn;<sup><xref rid="fn2387">44</xref></sup> they go to the place of the ark which serves as the footstool for God&#x2019;s feet.</p>
<p>This is the blessing:<sup><xref rid="fn2388">45</xref></sup> May God be a wall of fire round about Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2389">46</xref></sup> May Israel be God&#x2019;s treasure.<sup><xref rid="fn2390">47</xref></sup> May the Levites always teach the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2391">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. MOSES COMMANDED US A LAW. This is what they shall bear upon their lips and say from generation to generation: thus did we copy with our hands an inheritance from the mouth of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2392">49</xref></sup> The <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>lanu</italic> (us) applies to itself and also to another word.<sup><xref rid="fn2393">50</xref></sup> <italic>Morashah kehillat ya&#x2019;akov</italic> (an inheritance congregation of Jacob)<sup><xref rid="fn2394">51</xref></sup> should be read as if written <italic>morashah le-kehillat ya&#x2019;akov</italic> (an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob). It is similar to <italic>ve-hanevu&#x2019;ah oded ha-navi</italic> (even the prophecy Oded the prophet)<sup><xref rid="fn2395">52</xref></sup> (II Chronicles 15:8).<sup><xref rid="fn2396">53</xref></sup> Or<sup><xref rid="fn2397">54</xref></sup> <italic>morashah</italic> (an inheritance) should be read as if written twice. Our clause should be read as if written an inheritance, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2398">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A KING. The reference is to Moses, from whose mouth the heads of the people clearly heard the words of the Torah. The meaning of our verse is that Moses was the equivalent of a king, and the heads of the tribes were gathered unto him.<sup><xref rid="fn2399">56</xref></sup> This interpretation is supported by Scripture&#x2019;s statement that the Torah was given to the <italic>kohanim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2400">57</xref></sup> who, in my opinion, are meant by <italic>All His holy ones-they are in Thy hand</italic> (v. 3), and to <italic>all the elders of Israel</italic> (Deut. 31:9). This is what <italic>When the heads of the people were gathered</italic> refers to. Scripture also writes there, <italic>Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes</italic> (Deut. 31:28).</p>
<p>Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, of blessed memory, says that the <italic>king</italic> alludes to the Torah. He similarly used to explain <italic>there was no king in Israel</italic> (Jud. 18:l).<sup><xref rid="fn2401">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. LET REUBEN LIVE. Moses starts with the first-born, for this is the proper practice. He does not mention Simeon because of the incident of Baal-peor,<sup><xref rid="fn2402">59</xref></sup> for those who served Baalpeor were from the tribe of Simeon.<sup><xref rid="fn2403">60</xref></sup> Their number<sup><xref rid="fn2404">61</xref></sup> proves this.<sup><xref rid="fn2405">62</xref></sup> Also, their prince was killed.<sup><xref rid="fn2406">63</xref></sup> It is also possible that Moses followed in the footsteps of Jacob,<sup><xref rid="fn2407">64</xref></sup> who did not bless Simeon and Levi. The tribe of Levi was blessed out of respect for Aaron. Simeon had no one as great as Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn2408">65</xref></sup> Should one who disputes argue, &#x201C;Why did Moses bless Reuben?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2409">66</xref></sup> The answer is that Jacob blessed Reuben. The blessing was <italic>have not thou the excellency</italic> (Gen. 49:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2410">67</xref></sup> The meaning of the latter is that Reuben shall be like one of his brothers.</p>
<p>Moses mentions Judah after Reuben<sup><xref rid="fn2411">68</xref></sup> because he was in charge of a standard<sup><xref rid="fn2412">69</xref></sup> and he was the first to lead in battle. Next Levi and then Benjamin are mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn2413">70</xref></sup> because the Levites dwelled in Jerusalem, which was situated between Judah and Benjamin. Scripture clearly states this.<sup><xref rid="fn2414">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses then mentions the tribe of Joseph so as not to delay naming him. He had already mentioned his younger brother.<sup><xref rid="fn2415">72</xref></sup> He next mentioned Zebulun because he waged war.<sup><xref rid="fn2416">73</xref></sup> He then mentioned Issachar.<sup><xref rid="fn2417">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>After Moses finished mentioning the children of the wives, he commenced with Gad,<sup><xref rid="fn2418">75</xref></sup> who camped among the standard of the children of the wives.<sup><xref rid="fn2419">76</xref></sup> Moses then mentions Dan, who was in charge of a standard.<sup><xref rid="fn2420">77</xref></sup> He then mentioned Naphtali because he was older than Asher.<sup><xref rid="fn2421">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>LET REUBEN LIVE. A prayer.</p>
<p>AND NOT DIE. For it is possible that he will be as a person who lives a certain number of years and then dies.<sup><xref rid="fn2422">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THAT HIS MEN BECOME FEW.<sup><xref rid="fn2423">80</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-yehi metav mispar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2424">81</xref></sup> is to be rendered, and let his men not be numbered (few).<sup><xref rid="fn2425">82</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>And I have not learned wisdom</italic> (Prov. 30:3)<sup><xref rid="fn2426">83</xref></sup> and to the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>be-el shaddai</italic> (as God Almighty) (Ex. 6:3)<sup><xref rid="fn2427">84</xref></sup> as I have explained many times. Moses said this<sup><xref rid="fn2428">85</xref></sup> because it is possible for the tribe of Reuben to live forever but consist of few people. All things that are numbered are few. Compare, <italic>And I am men of number(Gen</italic>. 34:30).<sup><xref rid="fn2429">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND THIS FOR JUDAH. He similarly said to Judah,<sup><xref rid="fn2430">87</xref></sup> &#x201C;Let Judah live and not die.&#x201D; He also added, &#x201C;Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah&#x201D; when he goes to war, because Judah would go into battle first.<sup><xref rid="fn2431">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BRING HIM IN UNTO HIS PEOPLE. To the camp, which was in Gilgal.<sup><xref rid="fn2432">89</xref></sup> On the other hand, it might be a prayer regarding those who go to do battle in the land of the enemy.<sup><xref rid="fn2433">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIS HAND SHALL CONTEND FOR HIM. <italic>Rav lo</italic> (contend for him) means shall be sufficient for him<sup><xref rid="fn2434">91</xref></sup> so that he has no need for anyone to help him but God&#x2019;s help alone. Others say that the word <italic>rav</italic> is related to the word <italic>merivah</italic> (conflict). The meaning of <italic>yadav rav lo</italic> is that his hands shall fight for him. Others say that the word <italic>rav</italic> is like the word <italic>rav</italic> (shot forth) in <italic>and He shot forth lightnings</italic> (Ps. 18:15). It is related to <italic>va-robbu</italic> (and shot at him) (Gen. 49:23).<sup><xref rid="fn2435">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND OF LEVI. <italic>U-le-levi amar</italic> (and of Levi he said) is to be interpreted, And of Levi<sup><xref rid="fn2436">93</xref></sup> he said to God.<sup><xref rid="fn2437">94</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>say of me</italic> (li):<sup><xref rid="fn2438">95</xref></sup> <italic>He is my brother</italic> (Gen. 20:13).</p>

<p>WHOM THOU DIDST PROVE AT MASSAH. Massah is a noun. It means a test.<sup><xref rid="fn2440">97</xref></sup> The meaning of our clause is: Aaron was pious. Aside from the incident at Meribah,<sup><xref rid="fn2441">98</xref></sup> for which You already punished him,<sup><xref rid="fn2442">99</xref></sup> no unseemly thing was found in him.<sup><xref rid="fn2443">100</xref></sup> Also, this verse<sup><xref rid="fn2444">101</xref></sup> supports my interpretation regarding the incident of the calf, that is, that Aaron made the calf for God&#x2019;s glory.<sup><xref rid="fn2445">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THY THUMMIM AND THY URIM.]<sup><xref rid="fn2446">103</xref></sup> This means may Thy Thummim and Thy Urim always be his<sup><xref rid="fn2447">104</xref></sup> and his seed&#x2019;s.<sup><xref rid="fn2448">105</xref></sup></p>

<p>10. THEY SHALL PUT INCENSE. The reference is to those among them who are <italic>kohanim</italic>.</p>

<p>11. BLESS, LORD, HIS SUBSTANCE. The first-born and the tithe.</p>
<p>THE WORK OF HIS HANDS. The sacrifices.</p>

<p>THAT THEY RISE NOT AGAIN. <italic>Min yekumun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2457">114</xref></sup> (that they rise not again) means of those that will rise against them.<sup><xref rid="fn2458">115</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>la-yam mekhassim</italic> (cover the sea) (Is. 11:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2459">116</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. OF BENJAMIN HE SAID. <italic>Le-vinyamin</italic> means of Benjamin.<sup><xref rid="fn2460">117</xref></sup> Moses said of Benjamin, who is the beloved of the Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn2461">118</xref></sup> Benjamin shall dwell in safety by God, and God shall dwell between his shoulders.</p>
<p>HE COVERETH HIM. The reference is to God&#x2019;s glory which, as Scripture writes,<sup><xref rid="fn2462">119</xref></sup> dwelled in Benjamin&#x2019;s portion, in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>between his shoulders</italic> is, in the center of his inheritance. Or <italic>between his shoulders</italic> means that God&#x2019;s glory was visible.<sup><xref rid="fn2463">120</xref></sup> Furthermore, <italic>between his shoulders</italic> is also connected to <italic>covereth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2464">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. FOR THE PRECIOUS THINGS. Which the heavens will give.</p>
<p>14. THE FRUITS OF THE SUN. For the fruits of the seed and the vineyard are dependent upon the sun.</p>
<p>THE YIELD. <italic>Geresh</italic> (yield) is related to the word <italic>vayigreshu</italic> (cast up) in <italic>And its waters cast up</italic> (Is. 57:20). The moon does this<sup><xref rid="fn2465">122</xref></sup> via the moisture which is in the air,<sup><xref rid="fn2466">123</xref></sup> for its heat is unlike the power of the sun.<sup><xref rid="fn2467">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture reads moons<sup><xref rid="fn2468">125</xref></sup> because they renew themselves,<sup><xref rid="fn2469">126</xref></sup> and there are many of them in the year.<sup><xref rid="fn2470">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND FOR THE TOPS. This means and for the precious things that grow on the tops of the ancient hills.<sup><xref rid="fn2471">128</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE EVERLASTING HILLS. Scripture repeats itself.</p>
<p>16. AND FOR THE PRECIOUS THINGS OF THE EARTH. Scripture repeats itself. <italic>The earth</italic> refers to flat land.<sup><xref rid="fn2472">129</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE FULNESS THEREOF. From what it is full of.<sup><xref rid="fn2473">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE GOOD WILL OF HIM THAT DWELT IN THE BUSH. The reference is to heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn2474">131</xref></sup></p>
<p>LET THE BLESSING COME. <italic>Tavotah</italic> (let the blessing come)<sup><xref rid="fn2475">132</xref></sup> refers to this blessing.<sup><xref rid="fn2476">133</xref></sup> Two signs,<sup><xref rid="fn2477">134</xref></sup> the <italic>tav</italic> and the <italic>heh</italic>, are joined together.<sup><xref rid="fn2478">135</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ezratah</italic> (help) (Ps. 44:27);<sup><xref rid="fn2479">136</xref></sup> <italic>yeshu&#x2019;atah</italic> (salvation) (Ps. 3:3);<sup><xref rid="fn2480">137</xref></sup> <italic>ba-tzaratah</italic> (in&#x2026;distress) (Ps. 120:1).<sup><xref rid="fn2481">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses compared the tribe of Joseph to a bullock because he earlier spoke of produce.<sup><xref rid="fn2482">139</xref></sup> Moses referred to Joseph as <italic>His firstling bullock</italic> (v. 17) because a first-born bullock has great strength as it is the first of its father&#x2019;s might.</p>
<p>17. MAJESTY IS HIS. His<sup><xref rid="fn2483">140</xref></sup> body is large. It means that the tribe of Joseph is large in number.</p>
<p>THE HORNS OF THE WILD-OX. In power.</p>
<p>THE TEN THOUSANDS OF EPHRAIM. As in the words of Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2484">141</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. REJOICE, ZEBULUN, IN THY GOING OUT. To war. Similarly <italic>Zebulun is a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death</italic> (Jud. 5:18).</p>
<p>IN THY TENTS. Compare, <italic>For he saw a resting-place that it was good</italic> (Gen. 49:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2485">142</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THEY SHALL CALL PEOPLES UNTO THE MOUNTAIN. Zebulun shall possess great wealth because he dwells where ships dock. This is the meaning of <italic>they shall suck the abundance of the seas</italic>. The word <italic>shefa</italic> (abundance) is related to the word <italic>shifat</italic> (caravan) in <italic>The caravan of camels shall cover thee</italic> (Is. 60:6).</p>
<p>AND THE HIDDEN TREASURES OF THE SAND. The word <italic>sefune</italic> (hidden) has no brother.<sup><xref rid="fn2486">143</xref></sup> It has the same meaning as <italic>temune</italic> (treasures).<sup><xref rid="fn2487">144</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>admat afar</italic> (dust).<sup><xref rid="fn2488">145</xref></sup> The meaning of the <italic>hidden treasures of the sand</italic> is that Zebulun will have so much wealth that they [the tribe] will hide it in the sand. And because of their wealth, they will come in a multitude to the mountain of God to offer sacrifices of thanksgiving to the Lord.</p>
<p>20. ENLARGETH GAD. Moses compares Gad to a lion. All who see him will flee from him. No one shall torment him.</p>
<p>21. AND HE CHOSE A FIRST PART FOR HIMSELF.<sup><xref rid="fn2489">146</xref></sup> This means he looked out for himself and sought an inheritance before the other Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn2490">147</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THERE A PORTION OF A RULER WAS RESERVED. The word <italic>chelkat</italic> (portion of) means a portion.</p>
<p>[A RULER.] <italic>Mechokek</italic> (ruler) refers to someone who is great and a ruler. Compare, <italic>My heart is toward the governors</italic> (le-chokeke) <italic>of Israel</italic> (Jud. 5:9).</p>
<p>[RESERVED.] The word <italic>safun</italic> (reserved) is similar to <italic>safun</italic> (ceiled) in <italic>and it is ceiled</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2491">148</xref></sup> <italic>with cedar</italic> (Jer. 22:14); and <italic>sefunim</italic> (ceiled) in <italic>be-vattekhem sefunim</italic> (Haggai 1:4), which means your houses which are ceiled. The import of <italic>ki sham chelkak mechokek safun</italic> (for there a portion of a ruler was preserved)<sup><xref rid="fn2492">149</xref></sup> is that Gad saw the paneled palaces that were the portion of the nobles of the Amorites.</p>
<p>CAME. <italic>Va-yeta</italic> (came)<sup><xref rid="fn2493">150</xref></sup> is missing an <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2494">151</xref></sup> The meaning of our clause is that the heads of Gad came armed with the children of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2495">152</xref></sup> Moses prophetically saw this.</p>
<p>HE EXECUTED THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE LORD. Gad fulfilled with his hands<sup><xref rid="fn2496">153</xref></sup> that which he spoke with his mouth, for the children of Gad vowed that they would go out with Israel to wage battle against their enemies.<sup><xref rid="fn2497">154</xref></sup> Moses did not mention Reuben.<sup><xref rid="fn2498">155</xref></sup> It is possible that he omitted Reuben because the tribe of Gad were greater warriors than the tribe of Reuben. The words of Chronicles, which states regarding the tribe of Gad, <italic>whose faces were like the faces of lions</italic> (I Chron. 12:9), is proof of this. We do not find this stated regarding the tribe of Reuben.</p>
<p>22. LEAPETH. The word <italic>yezannek</italic> (leapeth) has no companion in Scripture. Our clause is to be understood as follows: Moses compared Dan&#x2019;s might to that of a lion&#x2019;s whelp leaping from Mount Bashan.<sup><xref rid="fn2499">156</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. SATISFIED WITH FAVOR. <italic>Seva ratzon</italic> (satisfied) is an adjective. It means he will be sated with favor.<sup><xref rid="fn2500">157</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE SEA AND SOUTH. <italic>Yam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2501">158</xref></sup> <italic>ve-darom</italic> (the sea and south) means that Naphtali&#x2019;s inheritance shall be in the southwest.<sup><xref rid="fn2502">159</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. THE FAVORED. <italic>Ratzuy</italic> (favored) means the beloved.</p>
<p>AND LET HIM DIP HIS FOOT IN OIL. Because of the abundance of oil. It is similar to <italic>He washeth his garments in wine</italic> (Gen. 49:11). Jacob similarly said,<sup><xref rid="fn2503">160</xref></sup> <italic>his bread shall be fat</italic> (Gen. 49:20).</p>
<p>25. IRON AND BRASS SHALL BE THY BARS.<sup><xref rid="fn2504">161</xref></sup> For mountains of iron and brass shall be in his portion.<sup><xref rid="fn2505">162</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND AS THY DAYS, SO SHALL THY STRENGTH BE. The word <italic>dovekha</italic> (thy strength) has no neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn2506">163</xref></sup> The interpretation of the Aramaic translation<sup><xref rid="fn2507">164</xref></sup> is known, namely, that you will be strong all your days. Some say that the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>dovekha</italic> is in place of the doubled letter.<sup><xref rid="fn2508">165</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>baze&#x2019;u</italic> (divide)<sup><xref rid="fn2509">166</xref></sup> in <italic>Whose land the rivers divide</italic> (Is. 18:2). They believe that <italic>dovekha</italic> is related to the word <italic>dovev</italic> (moving gently) in <italic>Moving gently the lips of those that are asleep</italic> (Cant. 7:10).<sup><xref rid="fn2510">167</xref></sup> This interpretation is not reasonable.<sup><xref rid="fn2511">168</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. THERE IS NONE LIKE UNTO GOD, O JESHURUN. Moses goes back to bless all of Israel.</p>
<p>WHO RIDETH UPON THE HEAVEN. That is, who is mighty. The fact that He <italic>rideth upon the heaven</italic> is proof of this.</p>
<p>[AND IN HIS EXCELLENCY ON THE SKIES.]<sup><xref rid="fn2512">169</xref></sup> It means, the heavens stand by God&#x2019;s might.<sup><xref rid="fn2513">170</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. THE ETERNAL GOD IS A DWELLING-PLACE. Note that the word <italic>ma&#x2019;on</italic> (dwelling-place) means a covering (i.e., a <italic>sukkah</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2514">171</xref></sup> <italic>In Salem also is set His covering</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2515">172</xref></sup> (sukko), <italic>And His dwelling-place</italic> (me&#x2019;onato) <italic>in Zion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2516">173</xref></sup> (Ps. 76:3) is proof of this. There are many such examples.<sup><xref rid="fn2517">174</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: The eternal God is your covering.<sup><xref rid="fn2518">175</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Even the Most High, thy habitation</italic> (me&#x2019;onekha)<sup><xref rid="fn2519">176</xref></sup> (Ps. 91:9) and <italic>Thou hast been our dwelling-place</italic> (ma&#x2019;on) (Ps. 90:1). The <italic>ma&#x2019;on</italic> (dwelling place) is always above the one who takes refuge in it.<sup><xref rid="fn2520">177</xref></sup> The &#x201C;place&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2521">178</xref></sup> is below.<sup><xref rid="fn2522">179</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND UNDERNEATH ARE THE EVERLASTING ARMS. Which will support you.</p>
<p>Scripture reads <italic>everlasting</italic> to teach that it shall always be so. The hand will not weaken, and your covering (<italic>ma&#x2019;on</italic>) will not be removed, for He is the eternal God. The meaning of <italic>kedem</italic> (everlasting) is that God has no beginning and no end. Scripture speaks in human terms when it speaks of beginning and end.<sup><xref rid="fn2523">180</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Gaon says that <italic>and underneath</italic> means and underneath God. He did not explain anything.</p>
<p>28. THE FOUNTAIN OF JACOB. All those who came forth out of the fountain of Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2524">181</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>And are come forth out of the fountain of Judah</italic> (Is. 48:1).</p>
<p>IN A LAND. <italic>El eretz</italic> is to be rendered, in a land.<sup><xref rid="fn2525">182</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>if they pray in this place</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2526">183</xref></sup> (el ha-makom ha-zeh)<sup><xref rid="fn2527">184</xref></sup> (I Kings 8:35).</p>
<p>YEA, HIS HEAVENS. The heavens of the earth or of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2528">185</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is, it is the nature of the land<sup><xref rid="fn2529">186</xref></sup> to produce corn and oil. Also, the heavens shall always give their dew and there will be no need to water the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn2530">187</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. WHO IS LIKE UNTO THEE. Among the nations.</p>
<p>THE SHIELD OF THY HELP. No evil shall come upon you.</p>
<p>AND THAT IS THE SWORD. He is the sword by which you will exalt yourself over all your enemies.</p>
<p>SHALT TREAD. <italic>Tidrokh</italic> (shall tread) is similar to <italic>midrakh</italic> (to tread on) in <italic>for the sole of the foot to tread on</italic> (Deut. 2:5). The contents of our verse are similar to the account of Gideon.<sup><xref rid="fn2531">188</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2344"><sup>1</sup> It speaks of the future. See I.E. on Gen. 49:1 (Vol. 1, p. 419).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2345"><sup>2</sup> <italic>Before his death</italic> is to be taken literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2346"><sup>3</sup> Rabbi Saadiah Gaon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2347"><sup>4</sup> See <italic>Sefer Ha-Emunot Ve-Ha-De&#x2019;ot</italic> 3:8. &#x201C;These (Sinai, Seir, Paran) are three names for Mount Sinai.&#x201D; The Gaon claims that the different names refer to different sides of the mountain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2348"><sup>5</sup> That is, to Sinai. Thus the meaning of <italic>Adonai mi-sinai ba</italic> (the Lord came from Sinai) is, God came to Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2349"><sup>6</sup> It means to Seir. Saadiah Gaon is reacting to an interpretation offered by Jewish heretics or apostates. The apostates interpreted our verse as follows: God first revealed himself to Israel at Sinai. He then revealed himself to the Christians (Seir). He then revealed himself to the Arabs (Paran). This heretical interpretation is based on a midrash which identifies Seir with Christianity and Paran with the Arabs. See <italic>Sefer Ha-Emunot Ve-Ha-De&#x2019;ot</italic> 3:8. Also see Mark Cohen, <italic>Under Crescent and Cross</italic>, p. 156, Princeton University Press, 1994.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2353"><sup>10</sup> To Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2354"><sup>11</sup> Verse 6 reads <italic>yechi re&#x2019;uven ve-al yamut</italic>, the import of which is, may Reuben live, and not die. If Saadiah Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation was correct the verse would read <italic>hachayeh et re&#x2019;uven ve-al tamito</italic> (keep Reuben alive and do not put him to death). In other words, Scripture would have employed the imperative <italic>hachayeh</italic> (keep him alive) rather than the third person <italic>yechi</italic> (let him live). It similarly would have employed the second person <italic>tamito</italic> (you will put him to death) in place of the third person <italic>yamut</italic> (he will die).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2355"><sup>12</sup> Christianity.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2361"><sup>18</sup> I.E. goes on to explain our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2362"><sup>19</sup> For a field is not a mountain. The field of Edom (<italic>sede edom</italic>) is parallel to Seir. If <italic>sede edom</italic> does not refer to a mountain neither does Seir.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2363"><sup>20</sup> We thus see that Jud. 5:4, which speaks of the earth trembling, does not refer to the revelation at Sinai for Ps. 68:8 indicates that the earth trembled in the <italic>yeshimon</italic> not at Sinai. I.E. comments thus because someone might still insist on identifying the field of Edom with Mount Sinai. It should be noted that I.E. insists that the clause &#x201C;the earth trembled&#x201D; in Jud. 5:4 and the similar clause in Ps. 68:9 refer to the same event. See I.E. on Ps. 68:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2364"><sup>21</sup> We thus see that Seir is to be identified with Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2365"><sup>22</sup> Are the sons of Eliphaz the son of Esau (Edom).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2366"><sup>23</sup> The verse quoted from Judges, Psalms, and Habbakuk.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2367"><sup>24</sup> See I.E. on Ps. 68:8. The meaning of Ps. 68:9 is that the earth trembled as Mount Sinai (<italic>zeh sinai</italic>) did. In other words, the phrase <italic>zeh sinai</italic> does not imply that what comes before (the earth trembled&#x2026;) refers to the revelation at Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2368"><sup>25</sup> In Paran and Seir.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2369"><sup>26</sup> The statement that fire came from God&#x2019;s hand to surround Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2370"><sup>27</sup> Hebrew, <italic>dat</italic>. I.E. renders <italic>esh dat</italic> (a fiery law) as a constant fire.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2371"><sup>28</sup> I.E. interprets our verse as follows: a constant fire comes to them at His right hand.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2372"><sup>29</sup> <italic>Yea, He loveth the peoples</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2373"><sup>30</sup> I.E. earlier interpreted <italic>in Thy hand</italic> to mean that the Levites camp around the ark. His comment here is either another interpretation or it explains why Moses refers to the ark as <italic>Thy hand</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2375"><sup>32</sup> Hebrew <italic>yissa</italic> (literally, they will bear).</ftnote>

<p>Note,<sup><xref rid="fn2545">14</xref></sup> Mount Abarim is also known as Mount Nebo.<sup><xref rid="fn2546">15</xref></sup> Nebo is in the image of Mercury.<sup><xref rid="fn2547">16</xref></sup> Mount Abarim is also known as &#x201C;the valley which is the top of Pisgah which is over against Beth-peor.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2548">17</xref></sup> The fact that Scripture tells us that Israel journeyed <italic>from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, by the top of Pisgah</italic> (Num. 21:20) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn2549">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture writes, <italic>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah</italic> (v. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn2550">19</xref></sup> Moses died there<sup><xref rid="fn2551">20</xref></sup> and his grave is there.<sup><xref rid="fn2552">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture states,<sup><xref rid="fn2553">22</xref></sup> <italic>So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor (Deut. 3:29). Now, Scripture tells us that after Israel dwelt in the valley&#x2026;the children of Israel journeyed, and pitched in the plains of Moab (Num. 22:1). Another verse states, And [Israel] pitched in the mountains of Abarim, in front of Nebo. And they journeyed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab (Num. 33:47,48). Look, it is clear that Moses&#x2019; burial place was in the place where he died.<sup><xref rid="fn2554">23</xref></sup></italic></p>
<p>UNTO THIS DAY. These are the words of Joshua.<sup><xref rid="fn2555">24</xref></sup> He probably wrote this at the end of his days.<sup><xref rid="fn2556">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. HIS NATURAL FORCE. The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>lechoh</italic> (his natural force) is in place of a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2557">26</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>oholoh</italic> (his tent) (Gen. 9:21).<sup><xref rid="fn2558">27</xref></sup> <italic>Lechoh</italic> is related to the word <italic>lach</italic> (moist, fresh).<sup><xref rid="fn2559">28</xref></sup> Scripture notes this<sup><xref rid="fn2560">29</xref></sup> because old people are overtaken by dryness. The word <italic>nas</italic> (abated) is the reverse of diffused.<sup><xref rid="fn2561">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. However, when Aaron died, <italic>even all the house of Israel</italic> (Num. 20:29) mourned out of respect for Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2562">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>SO&#x2026;WERE ENDED. When the days of weeping in the mourning of Moses were ended there,<sup><xref rid="fn2563">32</xref></sup> the children of Israel hearkened unto Joshua.</p>
<p>9. WAS FULL OF THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM. The reference is to the spirit of the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn2564">33</xref></sup> <italic>For Moses had laid his hands upon him</italic> is proof of this,<sup><xref rid="fn2565">34</xref></sup> for there was not found in Israel one such as Joshua for Moses to lean on.<sup><xref rid="fn2566">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES. That they hearken unto Joshua.</p>
<p>10. FACE TO FACE. I have previously explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn2567">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THE MIGHTY HAND. The wonders at the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2568">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE GREAT TERROR. When Israel stood before Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn2569">38</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2532"><sup>1</sup> In other words, Joshua composed Chapter 34.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2533"><sup>2</sup> Anything.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2534"><sup>3</sup> Mount Nebo. Hence he could not have composed this chapter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2535"><sup>4</sup> Chapter 34 was written under Divine inspiration. Hence it could be appended to the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2536"><sup>5</sup> That Chapter 34 was written prophetically, for otherwise how would Joshua know these things.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2537"><sup>6</sup> Hebrew, <italic>al pi Adonai</italic> (literally, by God&#x2019;s mouth). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2538"><sup>7</sup> Hebrew, <italic>al pi Adonai</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2539"><sup>8</sup> Hebrew, <italic>al pi Adonai</italic>. We thus see that <italic>al pi Adonai</italic> is not to be taken literally but is to be interpreted according to God&#x2019;s command. I.E. comments thus because there is a midrash which takes <italic>al pi Adonai</italic> literally and tells us that Moses died by God&#x2019;s kiss. See <italic>Mo&#x2019;ed Katan</italic> 28a; <italic>Bava Batra</italic> 17a. Also see Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2540"><sup>9</sup> Hebrew, <italic>va-yikbor oto</italic> (literally, and he buried him).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2541"><sup>10</sup> <italic>Va-yikbor oto</italic> (and he buried him) is to be rendered, and he buried himself. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the pronoun <italic>oto</italic> (him) or <italic>otam</italic> (them) sometimes has the meaning of himself or themselves.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2542"><sup>11</sup> <italic>Otam</italic> (them) is to be rendered themselves. Our clause thus reads, but the shepherds fed themselves.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2543"><sup>12</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2544"><sup>13</sup> Which is to be rendered, and the officers of the children of Israel did see themselves (<italic>otam</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2545"><sup>14</sup> Scripture refers to Moses&#x2019; burial place by the following names: Mount Abarim (Deut. 32:49); Mount Nebo (Deut. 34:1); the top of Pisgah (<italic>Ibid.</italic>); the valley (<italic>gai</italic>) which is over against Beth-peor (Deut. 34:6). I.E. goes on to explain that all of these terms refer to one and the same place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2546"><sup>15</sup> See Deut. 32:39.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2547"><sup>16</sup> Nebo is the name of an idol in the image of Mercury (Krinsky). See I. E. on Is. 46:1, <italic>Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth</italic>. According to I.E. the idol Nebo stood and was worshipped on Mount Abarim. Hence Mount Abarim was also known as Mount Nebo.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2548"><sup>17</sup> In other words, Mount Abarim, Mount Nebo, the valley which is the top of Pisgah which is over against Beth-peor all refer to one place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2549"><sup>18</sup> That the valley (<italic>gai</italic>) is to be identified with the top of Pisgah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2550"><sup>19</sup> We thus see that Pisgah and Mount Nebo refer to the same place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2551"><sup>20</sup> On Mount Nebo.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2552"><sup>21</sup> On Mount Nebo.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2553"><sup>22</sup> Additional proof that the valley and Mount Abarim are one and the same.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2554"><sup>23</sup> I.E. takes issue with the midrash that states that Moses died in the land of the tribe of Reuben (the location of Mount Nebo) but was buried in the land belonging to the tribe of Gad. See <italic>Sifre</italic> and <italic>Sotah</italic> 13b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2555"><sup>24</sup> Contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Meir in the Talmud that Moses also wrote this verse. See <italic>Bava Batra</italic> 15a: &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, dictated, and Moses wrote in tears.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2556"><sup>25</sup> <italic>Unto this day</italic> indicates that some time had passed since the death of Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2557"><sup>26</sup> The pronoun &#x201C;his&#x201D; is usually indicated by a <italic>vav</italic>. Here it is indicated by a <italic>heh</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2558"><sup>27</sup> Which is in place of a <italic>vav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2559"><sup>28</sup> Thus <italic>lechoh</italic> means his moistness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2560"><sup>29</sup> That Moses&#x2019; moisture did not abate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2561"><sup>30</sup> Moisture is diffused throughout the skin of a young person. However, it is removed from the skin of an old man. See Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2562"><sup>31</sup> The word &#x201C;all&#x201D; does not appear before the children of Israel. I.E. believes that Moses did not leave any survivors of such importance that out of respect for them all of Israel would participate in the public mourning for him. It should be noted that the midrash offers a different interpretation for the difference in mourning for Moses and Aaron. See Rashi: &#x201C;The children of Israel wept,&#x201D; i.e., the men; but regarding Aaron, because he pursued peace, and made peace between a man and his fellow, and between a woman and her husband, it is stated, &#x201C;The whole house of Israel wept [for him] the men and the women&#x201D; (Rosenbaum and Silberman translation). See <italic>Pirke De Rabbi Eliezer</italic>, Chapter 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2563"><sup>32</sup> In the plains of Moab.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2564"><sup>33</sup> Scripture states, <italic>And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him</italic> (Is. 11:2). It then goes on to explain that the spirit of the Lord is the spirit of wisdom and understanding (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). See I.E. on Ex. 31:3 (Vol. 2, pp. 645,646).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2565"><sup>34</sup> That <italic>Joshua was full of the spirit of wisdom</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2566"><sup>35</sup> Another term for &#x201C;place his hands on him.&#x201D; It is possible that I.E. interprets <italic>Moses had laid his hands upon him</italic> to mean relied on him, i.e., took him for a disciple. Be that as it may, according to I.E, <italic>For Moses had laid his hands upon him</italic> does not mean that the placing of Moses&#x2019; hand on Joshua caused Joshua to be full of the spirit of wisdom but rather that Moses placed his hands on Joshua because Joshua was full of the spirit of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2567"><sup>36</sup> See I.E. on Deut. 3:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2568"><sup>37</sup> See Ex. 14:31: <italic>And Israel saw the mighty hand of God</italic> (literal translation).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2569"><sup>38</sup> See Ex. 20:15,16.</ftnote>
