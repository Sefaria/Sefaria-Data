<title>PREFACE</title>
<p>The publication of the English translation of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s long commentary on Exodus, whose length is equal to that of the other four books of the Pentateuch, has given me a sense of accomplishment. This was a very formidable task that has taken many years. Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s style makes translation very complicated, and this is compounded in Exodus by its length. As his comments become longer, Ibn Ezra becomes more difficult to understand.</p>
<p>The long commentary, as opposed to the short commentary, was chosen because it is the version included in the <italic>Mikra&#x2019;ot Gedolot</italic> on the Pentateuch. A contributing factor is that Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s chief protagonist, Nachmanides, used it. A full and scholarly discussion of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s short and long commentaries appears in the <italic>Introduction</italic> that follows.</p>
<p>The long commentary on Exodus is unique. All Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s other works on the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa are of the short variety. This affords the opportunity to make comparisons and is therefore a work of special importance.</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone who helped in getting this difficult job done. May the Almighty grant us life, health, and the strength to complete the task.</p>

<title>FOREWORD</title>
<p>Students of Biblical exegesis are aware that there are two commentaries on the Book of Exodus ascribed to Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, a long commentary referred to as <italic>pirush ha-arokh</italic> and a short commentary referred to as <italic>pirush ha-katzar</italic>. The long commentary (henceforth referred to as L.C.) is about four times the length of the short commentary (henceforth referred to as S.C.) and equals in size Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentaries on all of the other four books combined. The S.C., on the other hand, is about the same length as each of the other four commentaries on the Pentateuch that Ibn Ezra composed.</p>
<h1>Short Commentary</h1>
<p>There is no question that the S.C. was composed by Ibn Ezra. It mentions Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s other commentaries on the Pentateuch in places that the L.C. does not. Thus the S.C. mentions Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s comments on Genesis in Ex. 1:11; 22:7; 25:18; and 30:16; his comments on Leviticus in Ex. 3:18; 12:16; and 20:20; his comments on Numbers in Ex. 3:1 and 27:19; and his comments on Deuteronomy in Ex. 14:4; 19:12,17,23; 20:1,18; 21:10; 22:15; 32:22; and 34:5.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the S.C. contains the characteristic anti-midrashic criticisms that are frequently not found in the L.C. (see Ex. 2:10,12; 13:18; 19:13,17; 25:31). There is also a greater tendency to explain difficult terms by reference to Arabic (Ex. 2:13; 6:13; 7:27; 9:21; 12:9; 16:1; 23:19; 24:6; 25:29; 36:8). In addition, &#x201C;The grammarian Ibn Janah is referred to as &#x2018;Rabbi Jonah,&#x2019; as he is in the commentaries on the other books of the Pentateuch, whereas in the L.C. he is referred to as &#x2018;Rabbi Marinus,&#x2019; the title used by Ibn Ezra when referring to him in the books he wrote in France: the commentaries on Daniel; the Minor Prophets and Esther; and in the grammatical works <italic>Sefat Yeter</italic> and <italic>Safah Berurah</italic>&#x201D; (Etan Levine).</p>
<p>Thus stylistically speaking, the S.C. fits in very well with Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s other commentaries on the Pentateuch. They form, as it were, a perfect set. We would thus expect the standard editions of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentaries on the Pentateuch to consist of five relatively short commentaries. However, this is not the case. The <italic>Mikra&#x2019;ot Gedolot</italic> edition of the Pentateuch has the long rather than the short commentary to <italic>Shemot</italic>. The same is true of the <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 38 manuscript (probably composed in the fifteenth century) of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentary on the five books of Moses.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the S.C. on Exodus seems to have been unknown, or at least unavailable, to the Jewish public after the introduction of printing. In 1839, Samuel David Luzzato came across a manuscript of Ibn Ezra containing the S.C. His teacher, Rabbi Yitzchak Shemuel Reggio (Yashar), one of the founders of the Rabbinical Seminar of Italy, obtained the manuscript and published it in 1840. Other editions were put out by Y. L Krinsky, Y. L. Fleischer, and A. Weiser.</p>
<h2>Long Commentary</h2>
<p>While there is no doubt about the authorship of the S.C., some scholars have questioned Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s authorship of the L.C.</p>
<p>Rabbi Joseph ben Eliezer Tov Elem, a fourteenth-century author of an important commentary on Ibn Ezra known as the <italic>Tzafnat Pane&#x2019;ach</italic>, argues that the L.C. is not the work of Ibn Ezra. He writes that he &#x201C;found in the land of the Christians a commentary on Exodus ascribed to Ibn Ezra that was as large as Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentaries on the other books (of the Torah).&#x201D; However, he &#x201C;found other works,&#x201D; that is, another commentary on Exodus (the reference is to the S.C.), in the beautiful country (the Land of Israel) and Syria.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Tov Elem then goes on to note that some remarks in the L.C. contradict Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s comments in the S.C. Rabbi Joseph does not list the contradictions. However, compare Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s comments in the long and short commentaries to Ex. 5:9; 11:21; 13:22; and 15:22. Also compare the L.C. on Ex. 18:7 and Gen. 23:7, and the L.C. on Ex. 34:28 and Deut. 10:1.</p>
<p>The L.C. repeats a number of comments found in Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentary on Genesis and in his introduction to the Pentateuch (see Gen. 27:19 and Ex. 31:18; Introduction to the Pentateuch and Ex. 12:2). Rabbi Joseph argues that it is not the style of Ibn Ezra to repeat himself.</p>
<p>In Ex. 12:9 we find: &#x201C;Behold, I the writer add to the words of this sage as I heard from his mouth.&#x201D; Rabbi Joseph claims that this shows that Ibn Ezra did not write the L.C.</p>
<p>Rabbi Joseph concludes that all of the above indicates that the L.C. was not composed by Ibn Ezra. He argues that it was put together by one or a number of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s students who gathered Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s notes or used an earlier edition of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s short commentary on <italic>Shemot</italic>, elaborated upon them, and thus gave birth to the L.C. on <italic>Shemot</italic>.</p>
<p>Although Rabbi Joseph ben Tov Elem&#x2019;s theory was accepted by the nineteenth-century scholar Shelomo Yehudah Rappaport, the preponderance of scholarly opinion holds that I.E. is the author of the L.C.</p>
<p>I believe that most of the evidence points to Abraham ibn Ezra as the author of the L.C. on Exodus which bears his name. The fact that the L.C. is four times as long as each of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s other commentaries on the Torah is by itself not a convincing argument that he did not write this work. This is especially so in view of the fact that fragments from a L.C. on Genesis are extant and have been published. The latter proves that Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s commentary on Exodus is not <italic>sui generis</italic>. In fact, it is possible that Ibn Ezra hoped to write a L.C. on all five books of the Torah. Be that as it may, it appears that Ibn Ezra wrote two long commentaries, one on Genesis and one on Exodus and that the one on Exodus survived.</p>
<p>The fact that a student added a note to Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s comment on Ex. 12:9 does not prove that the entire work was composed by a student or students. On the contrary, the fact that the student or copyist bothered to point out that the comment which follows was not written by Ibn Ezra indicates that what precedes and follows his quote did. Furthermore, Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s students occasionally inserted their comments into his other works as well. (See Mal. 1:12 and Ps. 119:103. For a full listing see Melamed, Ezra Tzion. <italic>Mefareshe Ha-Mikra</italic>, Vol. 2, p. 535. Jerusalem, 1978.) Is one to say that these works did not originate with Ibn Ezra because of the insertions?</p>
<p>The fact that some of the interpretations in the L.C. contradict some of those in the short commentaries is not proof that these commentaries are not the work of one hand. First of all, the contradictions are not in basic philosophical outlook. If the S.C. believed in God&#x2019;s corporeality while the L.C. did not, or if the S.C. claimed that astrology is not a true science while the L.C. believed that it was, then it would indicate that these two commentaries are not the work of the same person. However, these are not the sorts of contradictions that differentiate the long and short commentaries. We have differences in the interpretation of Biblical verses. Thus the L.C. explains God&#x2019;s statement, <italic>About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt</italic> (Ex. 11:4) as referring to God&#x2019;s decree while the S.C. says it refers to God&#x2019;s messenger. No author is totally consistent over the years. Indeed, it would be strange for an author to repeat himself exactly in a later book. Furthermore, I.E. was constantly on the move. He may not have had copies of his earlier books with him when he wrote his later books. In fact, it is almost certain that they were not in front of him when he wrote, for when Ibn Ezra repeats himself he never does so exactly, as would an author who has his earlier writing in front of him.</p>
<p>In his comments on Ex 3:6 Ibn Ezra writes, &#x201C;I have already explained in the <italic>Sefer Hashem</italic>.&#x201D; Had a student of Ibn Ezra composed the work, he would have written that this is already explained in the <italic>Sefer Hashem</italic>. It is highly unlikely that one of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s students would assume the mantle of his teacher. Incidentally, the phrase <italic>u-khvar pirashti</italic>, or the like, is one of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s idiosyncratic expressions. Its use here is further proof of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s authorship of the L.C.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that when Nahmanides (d. 1273) quotes Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s comments on Exodus he quotes from the L.C. (See Nahmanides&#x2019; commentary on Ex. 2:1,25; 3:2,13; 4:1; 14:19; 28:30). If the L.C. was not the work of Ibn Ezra then Nahmanides would most probably have heard any doubts about authenticity and would not have quoted from it as Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the L.C. contains the ideas and words of Abraham ibn Ezra. Despite its length, practically each sentence and almost every word in this work bear all the idiosyncrasies of Ibn Ezra. Moreover, the ideas and the theology of the L.C. are the same as those of the S.C.</p>
<p>Like all medieval Jewish philosophers, Ibn Ezra believed that God was incorporeal. He interpreted metaphorically all Biblical verses that speak of God. Thus in commenting on Gen. 1:23, Ibn Ezra writes, &#x201C;We know that the Torah spoke the language of man, for it was given to human beings who speak and hear. Now a human being cannot speak of things above or below him without employing human terminology. Hence Scripture uses such terms as <italic>the mouth of the earth</italic> (Num. 16:30), <italic>the hand of the Jordan</italic> (Num. 13:29), and <italic>the head of the dust of the world</italic> (Prov. 8:26).&#x201D; (See <italic>Secret of the Torah</italic>, a translation of Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s <italic>Yesod Morah</italic>.) He makes the same point, employing almost though not exactly the same words, in his comments on Ex. 19:20 and in his <italic>Yesod Morah</italic>.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra stresses the fact that ideas not words are what count. Thus he notes in chapter one of the <italic>Yesod Morah</italic>, &#x201C;The prophets do not preserve the exact wording when they repeat something. They only preserve its substance. For that is what is important.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He similarly explains in his commentary on Gen. 5:29 why Noah was called <italic>No&#x2019;ach</italic> (rest), not <italic>Menachem</italic>, even though Scripture tells us that Noah was so called because Lemach his father said, <italic>This same shall comfort us</italic> (yenachamenu) <italic>in our work</italic>. Ibn Ezra there observes, &#x201C;Comfort is a relaxation (or rest) of the heart&#x2019;s pain. The Hebrews are more concerned with the idea expressed by a word than with its etymology.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This is precisely how Ibn Ezra resolves the differences in wording between the Decalogue in Exodus and that of Deuteronomy. Ibn Ezra writes, &#x201C;Know, words are like bodies and their meanings are like souls&#x201D; (Ex. 20:1). He goes on to say that the words used are unimportant if the meaning remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Similarly, Ibn Ezra says that it makes no difference whether Scripture employs full or defective spelling. Thus in the introduction to his commentary on the Torah he writes, &#x201C;I will not make mention of the reasons offered by the Masoretes as to why certain words are at times spelled full and at other times defectively because all their reasons are of a midrashic nature. The fact is that Scripture sometimes fully and clearly spells out a word and at other times omits an unpronounced letter for the sake of brevity. Since the Masoretes claim to be able to explain the reasons for full and defective spellings, let them tell us what spelling the scribes should have used in writing Scripture.&#x201D; He makes the same point employing similar language in Ex. 20:1.</p>
<p>In Ex. 3:15 Ibn Ezra explains the numerical significance of the letters making up the divine name. What he writes there is parallel to what he writes in his <italic>Sefer Ha-Shem</italic> and in chapter eleven of the <italic>Yesod Morah</italic>.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra was an astrologer, and many of his Biblical interpretations are based on astrological beliefs. He thus hints that the flood came about as a result of unfavorable heavenly conjunctions (Gen. 14:4), and that Noah took the &#x201C;aspects&#x201D; into consideration when he sent the raven and doves from the ark (Gen. 8:5). He also offers an astrological interpretation for Laban&#x2019;s teraphim (Gen. 14:19).</p>
<p>We find the same astrological influence in the L.C. Ibn Ezra thus offers an astrological interpretation for the breastplate and the <italic>urim</italic> and <italic>thumim</italic> worn by the high priest (Ex. 38:6). Incidentally this interpretation is essentially the same as the one he offers for these objects in chapter nine of his <italic>Yesod Morah</italic>. He also speaks of the influence of the stars in his comments on Ex. 20:14 and 14:2. Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s explanation of the idol <italic>Baal-Zephon</italic> in Ex. 14:2 is in keeping with his explanation of Laban&#x2019;s teraphim in Genesis; that is, Ibn Ezra interprets them as astrological objects.</p>
<p>In his comments on Ex. 29:18 Ibn Ezra claims that it is wrong to seek medical care for natural illnesses. He goes on to say that Scripture criticized King Asa of Judah for seeking the aid of physicians rather than that of the Lord. Ibn Ezra makes this same point in chapter seven of the <italic>Yesod Morah</italic>.</p>
<p>On Ex. 20:1 he claims there is a reason behind each and every commandment in Scripture and that an intelligent person can discover these reasons. He makes the same point in chapter eight of the <italic>Yesod Morah</italic>.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra on Ex. 20:1 notes that Abraham, who lived before the revelation at Sinai, kept only the rational laws. He makes the same point in his comments on Gen. 26:5 and in chapter five of the <italic>Yesod Morah</italic>.</p>
<p>In his comments on Gen. 27:19, Ibn Ezra writes, &#x201C;Prophets are divided into two groups. One group consists of God&#x2019;s messengers concerning commandments; the other, those who foretell the future.&#x201D; He refers to the first type of prophet as <italic>sheli&#x2019;ach be-mitzvot</italic> and the second type as <italic>navi ha-atid</italic>. Ibn Ezra follows this distinction in his notes on Ex. 12:1, where he notes that the commandments were revealed only through Moses and Aaron, for they alone were prophets of the law (<italic>nevi&#x2019;e ha-torah</italic>).</p>
<p>In Ex. 14:30 Ibn Ezra says that <italic>and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore</italic> is to be read as if written: and Israel upon the sea-shore saw the Egyptians dead. He makes the same point in chapter five of the <italic>Yesod Morah</italic>.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra believed that reason plays an essential role in interpreting Scripture. In his comments on Ex. 20:1 he argues that Biblical statements which contradict reason are not to be taken literally. He makes the same point in the introduction to his commentary on the Torah and in the <italic>Yesod Morah</italic> (chap. 7, p. 10). He writes in the former, &#x201C;Every precept, be it minor or major, must be weighed in the scale of one&#x2019;s heart wherein the Eternal has planted some of His wisdom. Thus if there appears something in the Torah that is intellectually impossible to accept or contrary to the evidence of our senses, then we must search for a hidden meaning. This is so because intelligence is the basis of the Torah. The Torah was not given to ignoramuses. Man&#x2019;s intelligence is the angel which mediates between him and his God.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Although Ibn Ezra consistently emphasizes reason he often exhibits a simple faith and takes issue with those who do not interpret certain Biblical narratives literally. He disagrees with those who interpret Scripture&#x2019;s account of the Garden of Eden symbolically. Ibn Ezra writes, &#x201C;Note, the story of the Garden of Eden is to be interpreted literally. There is no doubt that it happened exactly as described in Scripture (Gen. 3:24).&#x201D;</p>
<p>He comments similarly on the verse telling us that the Lord made garments of skin for Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:21). There he notes, &#x201C;One should&#x2026;not bother to inquire into this matter. We ought to believe that God made garments of skin for Adam and Eve. Who can recount all of God&#x2019;s mighty acts? Who can tell of all of His wonders? There is no end to God&#x2019;s greatness.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The same trusting faith is displayed by Ibn Ezra in his remarks on the verse which relates that Moses&#x2019; staff turned into a serpent when cast on the ground (Ex. 4:3). Ibn Ezra notes that some commentators attempt to explain this phenomenon &#x201C;scientifically.&#x201D; However, he disagrees with their explanations, insisting that the verse deals with a miraculous occurrence.</p>
<p>When the rabbis of the Talmud offer an interpretation of a Biblical text which does not contradict its plain meaning, Ibn Ezra accepts the Rabbinic interpretation even though other interpretations of the text are equally plausible. Thus in the introduction to his commentary on the Pentateuch (pp. 18 and 19) Ibn Ezra writes, &#x201C;However, with regard to verses which deal with laws, statutes, and regulations, if we find two possible interpretations for a verse and one of them is in keeping with the interpretation of the transmitters of tradition, all of whom were righteous men, then without reservation and with all our might we will rely on the truth of their words.&#x201D; Ibn Ezra makes the same point in his comments on Lev. 22:22 and Deut. 5:25; 6:3; 25:5. He makes similar points in his L.C. on Ex. 12:2,8,22.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra not only accepts Rabbinic interpretations whenever they appear to follow the plain meaning of the text, he goes a step further and defends the Rabbinic tradition against attacks made upon it by the Karaites. (See his Introduction to the Pentateuch; Lev. 7:23; 23:11; 25:9,20.) We similarly find this to be the case with the L.C. (See Ex. 12:1; 34:21; 35:2.)</p>
<p>Although Ibn Ezra engages in anti-Karaite polemics and refers to them as Sadducees and heretics, he occasionally quotes their interpretations with deference. (Compare Gen. 9:26; 28:12; 49:27; Lev. 16:1; 23:15.)</p>
<p>We find that the same is true in Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s L.C. (See Ex. 3:2; 4:3; 5:5; 6:13; 7:3,10,12,29; 8:13,22; 9:16; 10:5,6; 12:2,3,5,19,29; 13:1; 17:16; 19:8; 22:7; 25:4,17,20; 35:5.)</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra believes that many of the Biblical narratives are not in chronological order. He thus points out that Abraham&#x2019;s call to leave his father&#x2019;s house occurred before Terah left Ur of the Chaldeans even though Scripture tells us of Terah&#x2019;s departure before it relates God&#x2019;s call to Abraham (Gen. 12:1). He similarly notes (Gen. 38:1) that the incident of Judah and Tamar (Gen. 38) occurred before Joseph was sold into bondage even though Scripture records it after the account of Joseph&#x2019;s enslavement (Gen. 37).</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra also points out that Lev. 25:1; 26:25,46; Num. 3:1; 19:2; Deut. 31:1; and Deut. 31:15 are not in chronological order.</p>
<p>He makes similar remarks on Exodus in his L.C. He thus explains that the command to record God&#x2019;s eternal war with Amalek was given in the fortieth year of Israel&#x2019;s sojourn in the desert even though it is recorded in Ex. 17:14.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra maintains that Jethro came to the wilderness of Sinai in the second year following the Exodus from Egypt. He thus argues that Ex. 18, which tells of Jethro&#x2019;s journey to Sinai, is out of chronological order. Ibn Ezra likewise maintains that Korah&#x2019;s rebellion, recorded in Num. 16:17, actually took place as soon as the tabernacle was erected and Aaron was chosen as high priest (Ex. 32:29).</p>
<p>There are certain stylistic idiosyncrasies which reveal the L.C. to be the work of Ibn Ezra. For example, Ibn Ezra often employs a <italic>mem</italic> in the sense of &#x201C;to.&#x201D; Thus in Gen. 1:5, Ibn Ezra writes, &#x201C;<italic>Erev</italic> (evening) is close in meaning (<italic>karov mi-ta&#x2019;am</italic>) to <italic>choshekh</italic> (darkness).&#x201D; He similarly writes in Gen. 2:11, &#x201C;The Gihon is close to the Land of Israel (<italic>karov me-eretz yisrael</italic>).&#x201D; In commenting on the word <italic>afilot</italic> (Ex. 10:31), Ibn Ezra writes, &#x201C;The word <italic>afel</italic> (very dark) in <italic>Even very dark, and no brightness in it</italic> (Amos 5:20) is close in meaning to it (<italic>karov me-menu</italic>).&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Ibn Ezra defines the meaning of a word he occasionally employs the term <italic>kemo</italic> (literally, like). (Compare, Gen. 45:11; 46:13; Lev. 24:23; 27:14; Num. 22:35; Deut. 29:8. We find that he employs the word <italic>kemo</italic> in the same way in the L.C. See Ex. 9:16; 10:8; 14:7.)</p>
<p>When I.E. wants to introduce a refutation of a given argument he occasionally uses the formula <italic>ve-im ta&#x2019;an to&#x2019;en&#x2026;u-teshuvatam</italic> (if one should argue&#x2026;they would answer) (Gen. 18:13) or the like (Lev. 24:43). Similarly, in the L.C. in Ex. 12:2 Ibn Ezra reads, <italic>ve-im ta&#x2019;an ha-to&#x2019;en&#x2026;ha-teshuvah</italic> (if one should argue&#x2026;the answer is).</p>
<p>When Ibn Ezra wants to point out that an interpretation is impossible he occasionally uses the term <italic>ekh</italic> (how). Thus in taking issue with those who identify the serpent with Satan, he writes: &#x201C;How (<italic>ekh</italic>) is Satan to crawl upon his belly or eat the dust of the ground (Gen. 31)?&#x201D; Ibn Ezra employs similar language in the L.C. on Ex. 15:22. There he takes issue with those who say that the booths in which the Israelites are commanded to dwell during the festival of Sukkot are in commemoration of the clouds of glory which covered the camp of Israel during their sojourn in the desert. He notes that Scripture explicitly states that the booths recall Israel&#x2019;s dwelling places in the desert of Sinai. He then goes on to say, &#x201C;How (<italic>ekh</italic>) did Israel dwell in clouds?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I.E. often quotes verses from memory. In so doing, he occasionally errs. (See Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s quotes from Ps. 94:4 in Gen. 36:24 and from I Kings 14:3 in Num. 32:49.) We find the same pattern in Exodus (L.C.). (See Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s quote from Lev. 25:39 in Ex. 1:14 and his quote from II Kings 8:22 in Ex. 34:6.)</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra occasionally uses sarcasm, word plays, and puns at the expense of those with whom he disagrees. (See Gen. 9:21; 12:13; 20:16; 28:17; 36:31; Is. 7:3; Amos 3:15; Job 5:7.) We find the same sarcasm and puns in the L.C. (See Ex. 4:31; 13:13,20; 20:23; 21:35; 34:21.)</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s interpretations are often extremely down to earth. He explains that Isaac sent Esau out to hunt for food because he was very poor and had little livestock at home. He thus notes that Isaac loved Esau because he needed him to provide food for his table. Ibn Ezra explains that Esau despised the birthright because Isaac had nothing to leave him.</p>
<p>Ibn Ezra likewise believed that Rebecca spoke like a typical mother when she took upon herself any curse that Isaac might place upon Jacob. He likewise notes that Abraham, Jacob, and other Biblical characters were not above bending the truth when they had to.</p>
<p>The same down-to-earth interpretations are displayed in the L.C. Thus Ibn Ezra notes that God arranged for Moses to be raised in Pharaoh&#x2019;s palace and not among the Hebrew slaves so that he would grow up with the personality of a nobleman rather than that of a slave (Ex. 2:3). Ibn Ezra similarly explains that the Israelites did not turn and fight the Egyptians who pursued them because slaves do not ordinarily wage war against their masters (Ex. 14:13). He further writes that God sentenced the generation that left Egypt to die in the desert because they did not have the emotional stamina to conquer the promised land, as they were born and bred in slavery (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).</p>
<h2>Which Came First?</h2>
<p>What remains to be decided is which commentary came first; that is, did Ibn Ezra first write a S.C. and then decide to elaborate upon it, or did he write a L.C. and then decide to abridge it? Students of Ibn Ezra are divided on this point. Nevertheless, by examining and analyzing the works one can arrive at a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>There is some textual evidence that the S.C. preceded the L.C. The scholar Y.L. Fleisher points out that in the S.C. on Ex. 25:31, I.E. refers to those who believe that the word <italic>te&#x2019;aseh</italic> (be made) should be spelled with a <italic>yod</italic> as <italic>chasere da&#x2019;at</italic> (lacking intelligence). However, in his L.C., I.E. notes that the wise men of Tiberias, who carefully went over every word in Scripture, maintain that the word <italic>te&#x2019;aseh</italic> in Ex. 25:31 is spelled with a <italic>yod</italic>. I.E. does not take issue with the wise men of Tiberias. He merely notes that in the Spanish editions of the Torah the word is spelled without a <italic>yod</italic>. He then goes on say that according to the rules of grammar the word should be spelled without a <italic>yod</italic>, and if the Tiberian reading is correct then <italic>te&#x2019;aseh</italic> in Ex. 25:31 is an exception to the rule.</p>
<p>It is thus clear that when I.E. wrote the S.C. he was not aware of the opinion of the Tiberian scholars, but he was aware of it when he wrote the L.C. This indicates that the S.C. came first. Otherwise we have to assume that I.E. was aware of the opinion of the Tiberians, mentioned them in his commentary, and then forgot their opinion, referring to those who held a similar opinion as &#x201C;lacking intelligence.&#x201D; That hardly makes sense.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if one writes a long commentary and abbreviates it, then a comparison of the two works indicates that one is an abridged version of the other. This is not the case with the L.C. and S.C. While there are parallels between the commentaries, and some materials of the S.C. are in the L.C., the short commentary does not seem to be an abridged version of the long commentary. It thus appears that I.E. wrote a S.C. on the Pentateuch and then a long commentary.</p>
<p>Finally, it is clear that the S.C. on Exodus fits in with I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. They form a set. Thus there is no doubt that I.E. wrote and completed a short commentary on the Pentateuch.</p>
<p>We also have a second version of I.E.&#x2019;s Introduction to the Pentateuch plus fragments of a long commentary on Genesis in addition to our L.C. on Exodus.</p>
<p>Unless there is some compelling evidence to the contrary, which there is not, the normal course of human events would dictate that I.E. first completed a short commentary on the Pentateuch and then set out to work on his long commentary. However, for one reason or another he was never able to complete his work.</p>
<p>One would reach the same conclusion if the opposite were true, that is, if we had a long commentary on the entire Pentateuch and a short commentary on Genesis and Exodus. In that case, we would say that I.E. first completed his long commentary and then started work on a short commentary which he never completed.</p>
<p>The latter becomes even more compelling when we consider the fact that at the age of sixty-four I.E. became ill and promised to write a commentary on the Pentateuch if God would restore him to health. Furthermore, in the L.C., in his poem introducing the Torah portion <italic>Yitro</italic>, I.E. alludes to his weakened condition. He speaks of the loss of half of his strength and of being a prisoner of hope, i.e., hoping to be restored to full health.</p>
<p>Finally, I.E. refers to his commentary on Exodus as &#x201C;the very ark&#x2026;which the author prepared for himself.&#x201D; The &#x201C;ark&#x201D; alludes to a coffin. I.E. is apparently saying that his commentary will serve as his memorial. This certainly appears to be the writing of a person who feels that his life is drawing to a close.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the likely scenario is that I.E. completed what we now consider the short commentary on the Pentateuch, and then started writing his long commentary. He was able to complete only the commentary on Genesis, which is lost except for a few extracts, and the long commentary on Exodus, which we have. He died before he could write any more.</p>

<h1>SHEMOT</h1>
<p align="blockquote">May the writer and the reader be strong and steadfast<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> in the very ark<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> which is the house which the author prepared for himself.</p>
<p align="blockquote">I now begin to explain the Torah portion, <italic>Shemot;</italic> which opens the second Book of the Torah.</p>
<p>1. NOW THESE ARE. Our book opens with a <italic>vav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> because the end of Genesis relates that <italic>Joseph saw the children of the third generation</italic> (Genesis 50:23).<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> Scripture notes that Joseph&#x2019;s brothers were few in number when they descended to Egypt but that they were fruitful and multiplied there (Exodus 1:7).</p>
<p>The word <italic>elleh</italic> (these) and <italic>el</italic> (these) are employed equally with the masculine and the feminine. We thus find, <italic>For all these abominations</italic> (ha-to&#x2019;evot ha-el)<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> (Leviticus 18:27) and then afterward, <italic>any of these abominations</italic> (ha-to&#x2019;evot ha-elleh) (Lev. 18:29). We similarly read, <italic>unto these men</italic> (la-anashim ha-el) (Gen. 19:8); <italic>These four</italic> (arba&#x2019;at elleh) <italic>were born to the giant</italic> (II Samuel 21:22); <italic>and what can I do this day for these</italic> (la-elleh) <italic>my daughters</italic> (Gen. 31:43). The same is the case with the word <italic>laz</italic> (that one).<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> We thus find, <italic>that Shunamite</italic> (ha-shunammit ha-laz) (II Kings 4:25) and <italic>this young man</italic> (ha-na&#x2019;ar ha-laz) (Zechariah 2:8). The fact that the word <italic>elleh</italic> is penultimately accented indicates that its <italic>heh</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>laylah</italic> (night)<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> and the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>nachlah</italic> (brook) in <italic>the Brook of</italic> (nachlah) <italic>Egypt</italic> (Numbers 34:5).<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE NAMES OF.] <italic>Shem</italic> (name) is masculine. Its plural form is <italic>shemot</italic> (names), for the <italic>tav</italic> is used for both the masculine and the feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>mekomot</italic> (places)<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> and <italic>avot</italic> (fathers). The <italic>mem</italic> is similarly used as a masculine and feminine plural. Compare, <italic>nashim</italic> (women) and <italic>pilagshim</italic> (concubines).<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> We also find some nouns employing both the <italic>tav</italic> and the <italic>mem</italic> in the plural forms. Compare, <italic>nefashim</italic> (souls) (Ezekiel 13:20) and <italic>nefashot</italic> (souls)<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> (Ezek. 13:18). We similarly find, <italic>levavot</italic> (hearts) (II Chronicles 28:9) and <italic>levavim</italic> (hearts).<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>al livvehen</italic> (upon their hearts)<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup> (Nahum 2:8).</p>
<p>[Into Egypt.] The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>mitzrayemah</italic> (into Egypt) is in place of the word <italic>el</italic> (to). Compare, <italic>dotayenah</italic> (to Dothan) in <italic>nelekh dotayenah</italic> (let us go down to Dothan) (Gen. 37:16); and <italic>yerushalayemah</italic> (to Jerusalem) in <italic>and brought me in the vision of God to Jerusalem</italic> (Ezek. 8:3).<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH JACOB. <italic>Et ya&#x2019;akov</italic> means with Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>In that day the Lord made a covenant with</italic> (et) <italic>Abram</italic> (Gen. 15:18).</p>
<p>EVERY MAN CAME WITH HIS HOUSEHOLD. <italic>Beto</italic> (his household) refers to those who came out of his loins. The term <italic>bayit</italic> (house, household) in Scripture never refers to a wife.<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> <italic>Every man came with his household</italic> (beto) is proof of this, for the wives of the tribes are not included in the seventy who descended into Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup> Do not permit the verse <italic>and</italic> (the high priest shall) <italic>have made atonement for himself, and for his household</italic> (beto) (Lev. 16:18) to cause you any difficulty.<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> For according to the plain meaning of the text, <italic>beto</italic> (his household) refers to his father&#x2019;s house. <italic>Beto</italic> (his household) must be so interpreted because the high priest made three confessions on the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> The priest&#x2019;s helpmate, who is his wife, is included in the term <italic>for himself</italic>. She is included with him because a husband and a wife make a &#x201C;man.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. REUBEN. When a word beginning with a letter that is vocalized with a mobile <italic>sheva</italic> (<italic>sheva na</italic>), e.g., the <italic>zayin</italic> of Zevulun, has a <italic>bet, vav, kaf</italic>, or <italic>lamed</italic> prefixed to it, the prefix ideally should also be vocalized with a mobile <italic>sheva</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> However, due to the impossibility of sounding two mobile <italic>sheva&#x2019;im</italic> in succession these prefixes are vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> rather than with a <italic>sheva</italic>. Hence if the word <italic>zevulun</italic> has a <italic>bet</italic> prefixed to it we say <italic>bi-zevulun</italic> (in Zebulun), If <italic>zevulun</italic> has a <italic>kaf</italic> or <italic>lamed</italic> prefixed to it we say <italic>ki-zevulun</italic> (like Zebulun) or <italic>li-zevulun</italic> (to Zebulun). However, if the word has a <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to it then it is vocalized with a <italic>shuruk</italic> rather than a <italic>chirik</italic>. We sound the <italic>vav</italic> as if it had an <italic>alef</italic> preceding it and pronounce the word <italic>u-zevulun</italic> (and Zebulun) for the word is sounded as if it were written <italic>alef vav</italic> plus <italic>zevulun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup> However, if we deal with a word whose first letter is a <italic>yod</italic>, an example being the name <italic>yehudah</italic>, then the <italic>yod</italic> is silent, for the <italic>yod</italic> is one of the quiescent letters.<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>biyhudah</italic> (against Judah) in <italic>Let us go up against Judah</italic> (Isaiah 7:6) and <italic>kiyhudah</italic> (like Judah) and <italic>liyhudah</italic> (of Judah) in <italic>Of Judah, Nahshon</italic> (Num. 1:7). In the latter case the <italic>yod</italic> is silent and is not perceived or felt when the word is enunciated. The same is also the case when a <italic>vav</italic> is prefixed to the word <italic>yehudah</italic>. The word is pronounced <italic>viyhudah</italic>.</p>
<p>The tribes are here listed in order of their births.<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. ISSACHAR. Because the two <italic>sins</italic> in <italic>yissachar</italic> (Issachar) are written in succession only one is sounded. Compare, the word <italic>machtzetzrim</italic> (did blow) (I Chron. 15:24), which is pronounced <italic>machtzerim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> We do not find a similar case with regard to the <italic>sin</italic> in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is customary for the Hebrews to pronounce a <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to the labials which are related to the <italic>vav</italic>, namely, the <italic>bet, mem, peh</italic> with an <italic>alef</italic> added to it,<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> and to vocalize the <italic>vav</italic> with a <italic>shuruk</italic>. Compare, <italic>u-faru</italic> (and they shall be fruitful) in <italic>and they shall be fruitful and multiply</italic> (Jeremiah 23:3); and <italic>u-male&#x2019;u</italic> (shall be full) in <italic>and the houses of the Egyptians shall he full of swarms of flies</italic> (Ex. 8:17). The word <italic>u-vinyamin</italic> (and Benjamin) is similar. Benjamin is listed before the children of the handmaidens<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> because he was a son of one of Jacob&#x2019;s wives.</p>
<p>4. DAN. Names are connected to each other in Scripture in six different ways. All of these styles are correct. One way of listing names is, <italic>Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad</italic> (Gen. 10:22).<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup> A second manner is, <italic>with carbuncles, purple, and richly woven work, and fine linen</italic> (Ezek. 27:16).<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> A third way is, <italic>carnelian, topaz, and smaragd</italic> (Ex. 28:17).<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> A fourth way is, <italic>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> The fifth is, <italic>Myrrh, and aloes, and cassia</italic> (Psalms 45:9).<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> The sixth way is, <italic>Adam, Seth, Enosh</italic> (I Chron. 1:1).<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. WERE. The word <italic>yehi</italic> (let it be)<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup> should have been vocalized like the word <italic>yirev</italic> (the multitude)<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup> in <italic>and the multitude of the burdens against him</italic> (II Chron. 24:27). However, since the <italic>heh</italic> is a guttural, the word <italic>yehi</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic><sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> beneath the first <italic>yod</italic> and the word is read <italic>yehi</italic>. Furthermore, the final <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>yehi</italic> should have been pronounced with a sounded <italic>sheva nach</italic> (a quiescent <italic>sheva</italic>) as is the case with the word <italic>yirev</italic>. The word should thus have been pronounced <italic>yihey</italic>. However, because of the difficulty involved in the enunciation of the word in the aforementioned manner, the <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup> was silenced and we vocalized the <italic>heh</italic> with a <italic>chirik</italic>. Hence the word is pronounced <italic>yehi</italic> (<italic>sheva</italic> beneath the <italic>yod</italic>) as in, <italic>Behold, would it might be</italic> (yehi) <italic>according to thy word</italic> (Gen. 30:34), or <italic>yehi</italic> (<italic>segol</italic> beneath the <italic>yod</italic>), as in <italic>For He spoke, and it was</italic> (va-yehi) (Ps. 33:9). The accent is placed on the last syllable of <italic>yehi</italic> and a <italic>sheva</italic> is placed beneath its <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup> because the word is used often in conversation, as in <italic>So be</italic> (yehi khen) <italic>the Lord</italic> (Ex. 10:10). Therefore only this root and the root of <italic>va-yechi</italic> in <italic>And Jacob lived</italic><sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup> (Gen. 47: 28) are found to have an imperfect <italic>yod</italic> prefix vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic><sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> when conjugated in the <italic>kal</italic>. The reason for this is that two letters of the two roots <italic>va-yechi</italic> and <italic>va-yehi</italic> consist of the quiescent letters <italic>yod, heh</italic>, the root of one being <italic>heh, yod, heh</italic> and that of the other <italic>chet, yod, heh</italic>. Now since the <italic>yod</italic> and the <italic>heh</italic> are quiescent letters and are at times not pronounced at the end of a word, the <italic>yod</italic> prefix is vocalized with a <italic>shev</italic>a. We do not find any such other case in the <italic>kal</italic>.</p>
<p>THAT CAME OUT OF THE LOINS OF JACOB. Loins allude to the male organ which is located near the loins.<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>and Saul went to cover his feet</italic> (I Sam. 24:4).<sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>The offspring of Jacob who descended to Egypt really numbered sixty-nine, not including Jacob who should be counted first. The Pentateuch therefore first states <italic>et ya&#x2019;akov</italic> (with Jacob), the meaning of which is as we have noted earlier.<sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup> In the first listing of Jacob&#x2019;s descendants in the Torah portion <italic>va-yiggash</italic> (then Judah came near unto him) (Gen. 44:18), Scripture states, <italic>And these are the names of the children of Israel who came unto Egypt, Jacob and his sons</italic><sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup> (Gen. 46:8). Thus with Jacob, <italic>all the souls of his sons and his daughters</italic> (descended from Jacob and Leah) <italic>were thirty and three</italic> (Gen. 46:15).<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> The verse <italic>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten souls</italic><sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup> (Deuteronomy 10:22) is proof that Jacob is counted among the seventy, for Jacob had a soul. Similarly, Joseph and his two sons who were in Egypt are also included in the seventy.<sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND JOSEPH DIED AND ALL THAT GENERATION. A father and his son comprise two generations.<sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup> Proof of this<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup> is the fact that after Job&#x2019;s fortune was changed for the better, he <italic>lived a hundred and forty years</italic> and saw four generations<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup> (Job 42:16). Furthermore, our sages tell us that there were ten generations from Adam to Noah and ten generations from Noah to Abraham (Abot 5:2, 3). Now the years of each of the aforementioned generations were different one from the other.<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>And Joseph died</italic> is that he died in his greatness.<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup> Similarly, his brothers also did not see the evil days which followed.<sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND ALL THAT GENERATION.] This refers to the Egyptians. For Scripture goes on to note, <italic>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph</italic> (v. 8).</p>
<p>7. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE FRUITFUL. They produced children as a tree produces fruit.<sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND INCREASED ABUNDANTLY. <italic>Va-yishretzu</italic> (and increased abundantly) is similar to the word <italic>yishretzu</italic> (swarm) in <italic>Let the waters swarm</italic> (yishretzu) (Gen. 1:20). However, in the first instance<sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup> the verb is independent.<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup> It is like the verbs went, sat, stood, and lay. In the second instance<sup><xref rid="fn60">60</xref></sup> the verb is dependent upon something else. It is like the verbs ate, kept, and hired. We thus say, he ate the bread, he kept the thing, and he hired the donkey. The latter are called transitive verbs. Now <italic>yishretzu</italic> (swarm) in <italic>yishretzu ha-mayim</italic> (Let the waters swarm) is a transitive verb, while <italic>va-yishretzu</italic> (and increased abundantly) is an intransitive verb. Thus the root <italic>shin, resh, zadi</italic> is sometimes transitive and sometimes intransitive. It is like the root of the word <italic>shav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn61">61</xref></sup> which is at times intransitive as in <italic>and (God) will return</italic> (ve-shav) <italic>and gather</italic> (Deut. 30:3) and at times transitive, as in <italic>that then the Lord thy God will turn</italic> (ve-shav) <italic>thy captivity</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). It is possible that the word <italic>va-yishretzu</italic> alludes to the fact that the Israelite wives gave birth to twins and even more.<sup><xref rid="fn62">62</xref></sup> I myself have seen the quadruplets that a women gave birth to. Physicians tell us that a woman can have as many as seven fetuses in her womb at one time.</p>
<p>AND MULTIPLIED. They did not die in proportion to that of a large nation.<sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WAXED EXCEEDINGLY MIGHTY. They had strong bones.<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>[EXCEEDINGLY.] The phrase <italic>bi-me&#x2019;od me&#x2019;od</italic> (exceedingly) indicates that there could not possibly have been any more of them.<sup><xref rid="fn65">65</xref></sup> The <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>bi-me&#x2019;od me&#x2019;od</italic> is like the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ba-rishonah</italic> (first) in <italic>and they took their first journey</italic> (Num. 10:13), for we also encounter the term with out the <italic>bet</italic> in <italic>they shall set forth first</italic> (rishonah) (Num. 2:9).<sup><xref rid="fn66">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE LAND WAS FILLED WITH THEM. The land of Goshen, also known as the land of Rameses.<sup><xref rid="fn67">67</xref></sup> Rameses is sounded with a quiescent <italic>sheva</italic> beneath the <italic>ayin</italic>, for the first <italic>sheva</italic> in Rameses, the <italic>sheva</italic> beneath the <italic>ayin</italic> which is connected to the <italic>resh</italic>, is called a <italic>sheva nach</italic>. The second <italic>sheva</italic>, the one beneath the <italic>mem</italic>, is called a <italic>sheva na</italic> (mobile <italic>sheva</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn68">68</xref></sup> because the lips seem to begin to first move when it is uttered.<sup><xref rid="fn69">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. NOW THERE AROSE A NEW KING. This is to be taken literally without any embellishments.<sup><xref rid="fn70">70</xref></sup> Scripture reads, <italic>and there arose</italic> (va-yakam) because the new king was not of the royal seed. It is like <italic>that my son hath stirred up</italic> (hekim)<sup><xref rid="fn71">71</xref></sup> <italic>my servant to lie in wait against me</italic> (I Sam. 22:8).</p>
<p>9. AND HE SAID UNTO HIS PEOPLE. The Egyptians.<sup><xref rid="fn72">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>BEHOLD THE PEOPLE. The word <italic>am</italic> (people) is not in the construct with <italic>bene yisrael</italic> (the children of Israel). The term <italic>bene yisrael</italic> explains <italic>am</italic> and provides additional information concerning its meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup> It is like the words <italic>That I Am</italic> in the phrase <italic>I Am That I Am</italic> (Ex. 3:14)<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup> and the words <italic>Abraham and Isaac</italic> in the verse <italic>The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk</italic> (Gen. 48:15).<sup><xref rid="fn75">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR US. When the word <italic>mi-mennu</italic> (for us) is in the plural<sup><xref rid="fn76">76</xref></sup> the books of the Babylonians<sup><xref rid="fn77">77</xref></sup> adhere to the grammatical rule<sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup> and always omit the <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>nun</italic> in order to differentiate between <italic>mi-mennu</italic> in the plural and <italic>mi-mennu</italic> in <italic>Out of him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn79">79</xref></sup> (mi-mennu) <italic>shall come forth the cornerstone</italic> (Zech. 10:4). In the latter, <italic>nu</italic> is a third person singular suffix and has a <italic>dagesh</italic> placed in the <italic>nun</italic> in accordance with the grammatical rule.<sup><xref rid="fn80">80</xref></sup> However, all the books coming out of the Land of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn81">81</xref></sup> have a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>mi-mennu</italic> both in the singular and in the plural because the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>mi-menni</italic> (from me)<sup><xref rid="fn82">82</xref></sup> in the singular has a <italic>dagesh</italic> despite the rule.<sup><xref rid="fn83">83</xref></sup> For the <italic>nuns</italic> of <italic>ani</italic> (I) and <italic>necheni</italic> (hath led me) in <italic>the Lord hath led me</italic> (Gen. 24:27)<sup><xref rid="fn84">84</xref></sup> do not receive a <italic>dagesh</italic>.</p>
<p>Now the word <italic>min</italic> (from) is doubled,<sup><xref rid="fn85">85</xref></sup> the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>mi-menni</italic> receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> to make up for the missing <italic>nun</italic> of the second <italic>min</italic>, and the word is read as if written <italic>mi-menni</italic>. The <italic>nun</italic> of the first <italic>min</italic> is represented by the <italic>dagesh</italic> in the second <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>mi-menni</italic><sup><xref rid="fn86">86</xref></sup> and the <italic>nun</italic> of the suffix <italic>ni</italic> serves as if it were in the place of the one speaking.<sup><xref rid="fn87">87</xref></sup> Similarly, the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>mi-munnu</italic> in the plural, spelled <italic>mem mem nun nun vav</italic> (Gen. 23:6), receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> and is read as if written <italic>mi-mennu</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn88">88</xref></sup> The reason that the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>mi-mennu</italic> (of him) in the singular receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> is to compensate for the swallowed <italic>heh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn89">89</xref></sup> for it is only in a few instances when the verb <italic>yishmor</italic> (he will keep) is combined with a third person suffix that we say <italic>yishmero</italic> (he will keep him). The same is true of the word <italic>yikre&#x2019;o</italic> (he shall be called) in <italic>whereby he shall be called</italic> (Jer. 23:6) and the word <italic>yirdefo</italic> (shall pursue him) in <italic>The enemy shall purse him</italic> (Hosea 8:3). The usual form of the third person suffix is <italic>yishmerehu</italic> (preserve him) (Ps. 41:8). Thus <italic>yishmero</italic> (he will keep him) is a shortened form. It is similar to <italic>hinnehu</italic> in <italic>and, behold, he</italic> (ve-hinnehu) <italic>was at his work</italic> (Jer. 18:3), in which <italic>hinnehu</italic> is a compound of <italic>hinneh</italic> (behold) and <italic>hu</italic> (he); and to <italic>ve-hinneh nitzav</italic> (and, lo he stood) (Num. 23:6).<sup><xref rid="fn90">90</xref></sup> At other times an additional <italic>nun</italic> is added,<sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup> as in <italic>yeshacharuneni</italic> (they will seek me earnestly) and <italic>yimtza&#x2019;uneni</italic> (they will find me) in <italic>They will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me</italic> (Proverbs 1:28). Similarly, the word <italic>tevarakhani</italic> (may bless me) in <italic>that thy soul may bless me</italic> (Gen. 27:19) is pronounced <italic>tevarekhanni</italic> because of the <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn92">92</xref></sup> We also find an extra <italic>nun</italic> in the word <italic>yekhabbdaneni</italic> (honoreth Me) in <italic>whoso offereth the sacrifice of thanksgiving honoreth Me</italic> (Ps. 50:23) and in the words <italic>yesovavenhu</italic> (He compassed him about), <italic>yevonanehu</italic> (He cared for him), and <italic>yitzrenhu</italic> (He kept him) (Deut. 32:10).<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup> At other times the third person <italic>heh</italic> suffix is swallowed by the <italic>nun</italic>, as in <italic>yishmerennu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn94">94</xref></sup> (kept it in) in <italic>and its owner hath not kept it in</italic> (Ex. 21:29).</p>
<p>10. COME (HAVAH). The word <italic>havah</italic> (give) in <italic>Give me my wife</italic> (Gen. 29:21) is in the masculine and as such is properly used there.<sup><xref rid="fn95">95</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>lekhah</italic> (come) in <italic>come, I pray thee with us</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn96">96</xref></sup> In the feminine we say <italic>havi</italic>, as in <italic>Bring</italic> (havi) <italic>the mantle that is upon thee</italic> (Ruth 3:15), and <italic>lekhi</italic> (go), as in <italic>Go and get thee in</italic> (I Kings 1:23). Now because these words are used often the masculine form is employed both as a plural and as a feminine singular.<sup><xref rid="fn97">97</xref></sup> Scripture thus reads, <italic>Come</italic> (havah), <italic>let us go down</italic> (Gen. 11:7);<sup><xref rid="fn98">98</xref></sup> <italic>Come</italic> (havah) <italic>I Pray thee, let me come in unto thee</italic> (Gen. 38:16).<sup><xref rid="fn99">99</xref></sup> It is like <italic>Come</italic> (lekhah), <italic>let us make our father drink wine</italic> (Gen. 19:32).<sup><xref rid="fn100">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>LET US DEAL WISELY. Let us search for a wise way to prevent them from multiplying.<sup><xref rid="fn101">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH THEM. The word <italic>lo</italic> (with them) is to be rendered, because of them.<sup><xref rid="fn102">102</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>li</italic> (of me) in <italic>say of me</italic> (Gen. 20:13).<sup><xref rid="fn103">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that all perfect and imperfect verbs imply a verbal noun.<sup><xref rid="fn104">104</xref></sup> In other words, even though a noun derived from a verb is missing in the text it is implied in the verb. For example, <italic>ve-hinneh berakhta varekh</italic> (and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether) (Num. 23:11)<sup><xref rid="fn105">105</xref></sup> and <italic>And when He hath blessed, I cannot call it back</italic> (Num. 23:20), the meaning of which is: And when he hath blessed a blessing, I cannot call it back.<sup><xref rid="fn106">106</xref></sup> The same is true of <italic>But in the multitude of counsellors they are established</italic> (Prov. 15:22). The complete version of the latter is: But in the multitude of counsellors, counsel is established.<sup><xref rid="fn107">107</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>when there befalleth us any war</italic> (v. 10) is to be interpreted as, when there befalleth us any accidents of war.<sup><xref rid="fn108">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Merinus<sup><xref rid="fn109">109</xref></sup> says that <italic>and get them out of the land</italic> means, and we will get us out of the land. He believes that Pharaoh said <italic>and get them out of the land</italic> so that Satan would not ensnare him in the utterances of his mouth.<sup><xref rid="fn110">110</xref></sup> However, I see no need for this interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn111">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. TASKMASTERS. <italic>Missim</italic> (taskmasters) is a plural. Its singular form is <italic>mas</italic>. This word is similar in form to <italic>pittim</italic> (pieces of bread) (Lev. 2:7) and <italic>pat</italic> (piece of bread) (Gen. 18:5).<sup><xref rid="fn112">112</xref></sup> The word comes from a stem whose second and third root letters are identical.<sup><xref rid="fn113">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>[TO AFFLICT THEM.] To cause the semen of the men to dry up.<sup><xref rid="fn114">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>STORE-CITIES. <italic>Miskenot</italic> means store-cities. <italic>Ha-sokhen</italic> (this steward) in <italic>unto this steward</italic> (Is. 22:15)<sup><xref rid="fn115">115</xref></sup> and <italic>sokhenet</italic> (companion) in <italic>and be a companion for the king</italic> (I Kings 1:2) are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn116">116</xref></sup> For the meaning of the latter verse is, let her be in charge of the king&#x2019;s treasury so that no one will know that she lies in thy bosom.</p>
<p>RAAMSES. Has a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>ayin</italic> and does not refer to the place where Israel dwelt.<sup><xref rid="fn117">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. BUT THE MORE THEY AFFLICTED THEM. Even though they were afflicted.<sup><xref rid="fn118">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE MORE THEY MULTIPLIED. As they did in the days when they were not afflicted.<sup><xref rid="fn119">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE MORE THEY SPREAD ABROAD. They were fruitful and increased above and beyond the norm.<sup><xref rid="fn120">120</xref></sup> <italic>Yifrotz</italic> (they spread abroad) is like <italic>poretz</italic> (breaketh) in <italic>And whoso breaketh through a fence</italic> (Ecclesiastes 10:8).<sup><xref rid="fn121">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. TO SERVE. Pharaoh devised many evils with which to afflict the Israelites. First he ordered them to do his work.<sup><xref rid="fn122">122</xref></sup> When he saw that this did not diminish their greatly increasing numbers he gave permission to the Egyptians and their princes to work them harder than slaves are normally worked. The latter is, as Onkelos explains, the meaning of the term <italic>be-farekh</italic> (with rigor). It is totally wrong to employ the form <italic>perukhim</italic> (broken) in liturgical poetry.<sup><xref rid="fn123">123</xref></sup> When Pharaoh saw that the above measures did not stop the Israelites from increasing, he called the <italic>midwives</italic> (v. 13), the ones who were in charge of all the other midwives, and commanded them to kill all the males that were born.</p>
<p>14. AND THEY MADE THEIR LIVES BITTER. It is known that the <italic>tav</italic>, in a majority of instances, is the sign of the feminine plural and the <italic>mem</italic> of the masculine plural. Compare, <italic>mo&#x2019;adot</italic> (seasons) (II Chron. 8:13) and <italic>mo&#x2019;adim</italic> (seasons) (Gen. 1:14).<sup><xref rid="fn124">124</xref></sup> According to the Spanish scholars verbal forms are kept and do not drop any of their root letters.<sup><xref rid="fn125">125</xref></sup> However, this is not the case with nouns. Nouns are only employed as found in Scripture,<sup><xref rid="fn126">126</xref></sup> for the singular of <italic>mo&#x2019;adot</italic> (seasons) is <italic>mo&#x2019;ed</italic>, not <italic>mo&#x2019;adah</italic> as the person who thinks he is so brilliant believes.<sup><xref rid="fn127">127</xref></sup> The latter would maintain that the plural of <italic>makom</italic> (place)<sup><xref rid="fn128">128</xref></sup> is <italic>mekomim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn129">129</xref></sup> and the singular of <italic>mekomot</italic> (places) is <italic>mekomah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn130">130</xref></sup> Perhaps he will open his eyes and see that the plural of <italic>bekhor</italic> (first-born) is <italic>bekhorim</italic>, as in <italic>To Him that smote Egypt in their first-born</italic> (bekhorehem) (Ps. 136:10).<sup><xref rid="fn131">131</xref></sup> However, we also encounter the form <italic>bekhorot</italic> (firstlings) in <italic>and the firstlings of thy herd</italic> (Deut. 14:23). Now, shall the singular of <italic>bekhorot</italic> be <italic>bekhorah</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn132">132</xref></sup> The same is the case with <italic>levenim</italic> (bricks).<sup><xref rid="fn133">133</xref></sup> Its singular is <italic>levenah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn134">134</xref></sup> not <italic>leven</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn135">135</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN MORTAR AND IN BRICK.] To build houses and fences.<sup><xref rid="fn136">136</xref></sup> They also had to plow, harvest, prune, and pick olives. This is the meaning of <italic>and in all manner of service in the field</italic>. Scripture then alludes to all the other types of work which Israel did to fulfill the needs of the Egyptians by the general term <italic>in all their service</italic>.</p>
<p>WHEREIN THEY MADE THEM SERVE. The word <italic>avedu</italic> (they made them serve) is to be read as if written twice. Our verse is to be read as if it were written: wherein they made them serve, they made them serve with rigor.</p>
<p>When a verb from the root <italic>ayin, bet, dalet</italic> is not followed by a <italic>bet</italic> it refers to work performed by a slave. This is the meaning of <italic>avadatikha</italic> (I have served thee) (Gen. 30:26).<sup><xref rid="fn137">137</xref></sup> However, when the verb is followed by a <italic>bet</italic> it has one of the following two meanings. It means for the sake of, as in <italic>va-ya&#x2019;avod yisrael be-ishah</italic> (and Israel served for a wife) (Hos. 12:13).<sup><xref rid="fn138">138</xref></sup> Its other meaning is illustrated by <italic>thou shalt not make him to serve</italic> (lo ta&#x2019;avod bo) <italic>with rigor</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn139">139</xref></sup> which is like <italic>which hath not been wrought with</italic> (lo ubbad bah) (Deut. 21:3).<sup><xref rid="fn140">140</xref></sup> <italic>Which may neither be plowed</italic> (lo ye&#x2019;aved bo) (Deut. 21:4)<sup><xref rid="fn141">141</xref></sup> is similar, for we find, <italic>And the land that was desolate shall be tilled</italic> (Ezek. 36:34).<sup><xref rid="fn142">142</xref></sup> In a like manner Scripture reads, <italic>As with the lender, so with the borrower</italic> (nosheh vo) (Is. 24:2).<sup><xref rid="fn143">143</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THE KING OF EGYPT SPOKE TO THE HEBREW MIDWIVES. These midwives were in charge of all the other midwives. For there can be no doubt that there were more than five hundred midwives.<sup><xref rid="fn144">144</xref></sup> These two midwives were in charge of all the other midwives and saw to it that they gave a tax to the king from the money they collected for their services. I have seen such a practice in many places. The opinion that the two midwives were mother and daughter was handed down by tradition, for it is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn145">145</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. WHEN YE DO THE OFFICE OF A MIDWIFE TO THE HEBREW WOMEN. Whoever comes from the family of <italic>ever</italic> (Eber)<sup><xref rid="fn146">146</xref></sup> is called a Hebrew. One is called a Hebrew because of his faith.<sup><xref rid="fn147">147</xref></sup> Hence <italic>the children of Eber</italic> (Ever) in <italic>the father of all the children of Eber</italic> (Gen. 10:21) refers to those who came from the side (<italic>ever</italic>) of the river.<sup><xref rid="fn148">148</xref></sup> The side of the river refers to one of the banks of the river.<sup><xref rid="fn149">149</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE BIRTHSTOOL.] Ben Kuraish<sup><xref rid="fn150">150</xref></sup> says that the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>ovnayim</italic> (birthstool) is superfluous because <italic>ovnayim</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>banim</italic> (sons).<sup><xref rid="fn151">151</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ovnayim</italic> is birthstool. <italic>Ovnayim</italic> is similar to <italic>afsayim</italic> (ankles)<sup><xref rid="fn152">152</xref></sup> in <italic>waters that were to the ankles</italic> (Ezek. 47:3). In reality, however, <italic>ovnayim</italic> is similar to <italic>ba-ovnayim</italic> (at the wheel)<sup><xref rid="fn153">153</xref></sup> and the <italic>alef</italic> is a root letter.</p>
<p>THEN YE SHALL KILL HIM. In secret so that it will not become known, because he was committing an act of violence.<sup><xref rid="fn154">154</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THEN SHE SHALL LIVE.] The word <italic>va-chayah</italic> (then she shall live) is irregular and presents a very difficult grammatical problem. The rules of grammar require <italic>va-chayetah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn155">155</xref></sup> because the <italic>heh</italic> of the root<sup><xref rid="fn156">156</xref></sup> changes to a <italic>tav</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn157">157</xref></sup> as it does in the construct in the case of the word <italic>chayat</italic> (beast of)<sup><xref rid="fn158">158</xref></sup> in <italic>and to every beast of the earth</italic> (Gen. 1:30). The reason for the change is that the <italic>heh</italic> and the <italic>tav</italic> are similar in appearance when written. The only difference between them is the extension of the dot that is within the <italic>heh</italic>. For the letter <italic>tav</italic> is first a <italic>heh</italic>. It is only when the dot is extended that it becomes a <italic>tav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn159">159</xref></sup> However, the <italic>tav</italic> and the <italic>heh</italic> are pronounced completely differently.<sup><xref rid="fn160">160</xref></sup> They also have different names.<sup><xref rid="fn161">161</xref></sup> This proves that our form of the letters is the original Hebrew script.<sup><xref rid="fn162">162</xref></sup></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the root of the word <italic>chai</italic> (lived) and the root of the word <italic>chayyim</italic> (life) are in doubt, for the grammarians have concluded that the root of the word <italic>chai</italic> (lived) in <italic>And Arpachshad lived</italic> (Gen. 11:12) is <italic>chet, yod, yod</italic>. The word <italic>tam</italic> (spent) in <italic>how that our money is all spent</italic> (Gen. 47:18) is similar, for it comes from the root <italic>tav, mem, mem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn163">163</xref></sup> The grammarians also agree that the plural of the root <italic>chet, yod, yod</italic> is <italic>chayyim</italic> (life). However, in my opinion we are dealing with an irregular root.<sup><xref rid="fn164">164</xref></sup> If this is not so<sup><xref rid="fn165">165</xref></sup> let someone show me a case where this root is conjugated in the imperfect according to the paradigm of <italic>chet, gimel, gimel</italic>, namely, <italic>achog</italic> (I will celebrate), <italic>tachog</italic> (you will celebrate), <italic>yachog</italic> (he will celebrate), <italic>la-chog</italic> (to celebrate).<sup><xref rid="fn166">166</xref></sup> If the root of <italic>chai</italic> were <italic>chet, yod, yod</italic>, it should be conjugated <italic>achoy, yachoy, la-choy</italic> in the imperfect or like <italic>sov</italic> (go about) or <italic>sobu</italic> (walk about) in <italic>Walk about Zion</italic> (Ps. 48:13) and <italic>sobbi</italic> (go about)<sup><xref rid="fn167">167</xref></sup> in <italic>Go about the city</italic> (Is. 23:16). This is proof that the word <italic>chai</italic> comes from a root ending in a <italic>heh</italic>. The fact that we do not find the root of <italic>chai</italic> conjugated in any of the above-mentioned forms is proof that it belongs to those verbs whose stems end in a <italic>heh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn168">168</xref></sup> for we say <italic>echeyeh</italic> (I will live), <italic>nichyeh</italic> (we will live), <italic>eheyeh</italic> (I will be), <italic>tiheyeh</italic> (you will be), <italic>yiheyeh</italic> (he will be), all of which come from the root <italic>heh, yod, heh</italic>. Now if this is the case it comes from the root <italic>chet, yod, heh</italic> and is like the word <italic>haya</italic> (was).<sup><xref rid="fn169">169</xref></sup> The fact that we find the word <italic>chai</italic> (lived) employed as a third person perfect in <italic>arpachshad chai</italic> (Arpachshad lived) (Gen. 11:12) does not disturb us.<sup><xref rid="fn170">170</xref></sup> We are not bothered by the aforementioned even though it appears that <italic>chai</italic> comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn171">171</xref></sup> What forced me to come to this conclusion is the fact that I saw that there is no root in Hebrew that ends in a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn172">172</xref></sup> The word <italic>shalev</italic> (at ease) (Job 16:12) does not disprove my contention.<sup><xref rid="fn173">173</xref></sup> Its <italic>vav</italic> is in place of a <italic>heh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn174">174</xref></sup> since the letters <italic>alef, heh, vav, yod</italic> interchange. Proof that what I say is correct is the word <italic>shalu</italic> (secure) in <italic>Wherefore are all they secure that deal treacherously</italic> (Job 12:1). For the root of <italic>shalu</italic> is <italic>shin, lamed, heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn175">175</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will now explain to you why a <italic>vav</italic> is never employed as a third letter of a root. The latter is so because the <italic>vav</italic> serves as a third person singular suffix, as in the words <italic>avdo va-amato</italic> (his man-servant nor his maid-servant) (Ex. 20:14). The <italic>vav</italic> also serves as the sign of the plural, as in <italic>peru u-revu</italic> (be fruitful and multiply) (Gen. 1:22). There are also superfluous <italic>vavs</italic>, as in <italic>beno be&#x2019;or</italic> (the son of Beor) (Num. 24:3).<sup><xref rid="fn176">176</xref></sup> Now if the <italic>vav</italic> was also used as the final letter of a root it would be confused with one of the three types of <italic>vavs</italic> that we have just mentioned, namely, the <italic>vav</italic> indicating a third person singular suffix, the <italic>vav</italic> indicating a plural, and the superfluous <italic>vav</italic>; we could not then ascertain the meaning of the word.<sup><xref rid="fn177">177</xref></sup> The same is also true of the <italic>yod</italic>. The <italic>yod</italic> cannot serve as the final letter of a stem because it is used as a first person singular suffix, as in the word <italic>yadi</italic> (my hand) (Gen. 42:37). It is also employed as a first person plural suffix, as in the word <italic>yadai</italic> (my hands) (Deut. 9:15). It is also the sign of the plural construct, as in <italic>yede</italic> (the hands of) in <italic>The hands of women full of compassion</italic> (Lamentations 4:10). It is used as the sign of the feminine imperative, as in <italic>de&#x2019;i and re&#x2019;i</italic> (know and consider) (I Sam. 25:17). It is used to indicate relationship, as in <italic>ha-ivri o ha-ivriyah</italic> (a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman) (Deut. 15:22). The <italic>yod</italic> is also used superfluously in verbs, as in <italic>ha-magbihi</italic> (that is enthroned) (Ps. 113:5) and in <italic>le-hoshivi</italic> (that He may set him) (Ps. 113:8).<sup><xref rid="fn178">178</xref></sup> It is used superfluously with nouns, as in <italic>beni atono</italic> (his ass&#x2019;s colt) (Gen. 49:11)<sup><xref rid="fn179">179</xref></sup> and also with particles, as in <italic>zulati</italic> (save) (Deut. 1:36) and <italic>minni ephrayim</italic> (out of Ephraim) (Judges 5:14).<sup><xref rid="fn180">180</xref></sup> For these reasons the <italic>yod</italic> is not employed as a final root letter lest it be confused with one of the above-noted <italic>yods</italic>. Therefore I maintain that the word <italic>va-chayah</italic> (then shall she live) is irregular and is a variant of <italic>va-chayetah</italic>. It belongs, as I have already explained, in the family of verbs ending in a <italic>heh</italic>.</p>
<p>17. BUT THE MIDWIVES FEARED GOD. The <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>va-tirena</italic> (feared) is not sounded lest the verb be thought to come from the root <italic>resh, alef, heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn181">181</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT SAVED. Even more than at first, they now worked with all of their strength to save the children. Otherwise what need was there for Scripture to be so verbose?<sup><xref rid="fn182">182</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND THE KING OF EGYPT CALLED FOR THE MIDWIVES, AND SAID UNTO THEM. You deserve to die<sup><xref rid="fn183">183</xref></sup> because you have not obeyed my command.<sup><xref rid="fn184">184</xref></sup> There is no difference in the form of the word <italic>va-tomarnah</italic> (said) in which the <italic>vav</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> when it is in the third person perfect, like the word <italic>va-tokhalnah</italic> (did eat) in <italic>And the ill-favoured, and lean-fleshed kine did eat</italic> (Gen. 41:4), and when it is used as a second person perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn185">185</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: Why have ye done this thing and preserved the man-children alive?</p>
<p>19. AND THE MIDWIVES SAID UNTO PHARAOH. We have not violated your command because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they have greater vitality.</p>
<p>The <italic>yod</italic> of the word <italic>chayot</italic> (lively) in <italic>For they are lively</italic> does not have a <italic>dagesh</italic>. This is correct Hebrew usage. Compare, <italic>davot</italic> (ill), <italic>ravot</italic> (satiated), and <italic>alot</italic> (giving suck) in <italic>the flocks and herds giving suck are a care to me</italic> (Gen. 33:13). However, the <italic>yod</italic> in the word <italic>chayyim</italic> does receive a <italic>dagesh</italic> because <italic>chayyim</italic> is an adjective. Compare, <italic>ve-nitpesem chayyim</italic> (we shall take them alive) (II Kings 7:12) in which the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>chayyim</italic> (alive) is like the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>ha-ivriyyim</italic> (the Hebrews) in <italic>the God of the Hebrews</italic> (Ex. 3:18). The word <italic>chayyim</italic> (life) also receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> when it is a noun, as in <italic>etz chayyim</italic> (a tree of life) (Prov. 3:18). Similarly, the <italic>tzadi</italic> of <italic>tzitzim</italic> (flowers) in <italic>and open flowers</italic> (II Kings 6:18) receives a <italic>dagesh</italic>.</p>
<p>AND ARE DELIVERED. <italic>Ve-yaladu</italic> (and are delivered) is a feminine perfect. The third person perfect has the same form in the masculine and the feminine. Compare, <italic>tavu</italic> (did spin) (Ex. 35:25) and <italic>tzave&#x2019;u</italic> (did service) (Ex. 38:8).</p>
<p>20. AND GOD DEALT WELL. When a root begins with a <italic>yod</italic>, the <italic>yod</italic> does not always drop out when the verb is conjugated,<sup><xref rid="fn186">186</xref></sup> The word <italic>va-yetev</italic> (dealt well) is an example. At other times a <italic>vav</italic> is substituted for the <italic>yod</italic>, as in <italic>va-yoshev</italic> (He maketh to dwell) in <italic>And there He maketh the hungry to dwell</italic> (Ps. 107:36). The root of <italic>va-yoshev</italic> is <italic>yod, shin, bet</italic>, as the root of <italic>va-yetev</italic> is <italic>yod, tet, bet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn187">187</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>And God dealt well</italic> is explained by what follows next, i.e., <italic>He</italic> (God) <italic>made them houses</italic>. The meaning of <italic>He made them houses</italic> is similar to <italic>that the Lord make thee a house</italic> (II Sam. 7:11).<sup><xref rid="fn188">188</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND IT CAME TO PASS, BECAUSE THE MIDWIVES FEARED GOD. Because the midwives did not fear the king of Egypt but feared the Lord, the Lord dealt well with them. Note that the verb <italic>yare&#x2019;u</italic> (feared) is neither transitive nor intransitive, because its meaning is, to be afraid of someone.<sup><xref rid="fn189">189</xref></sup> Hence the correct way of saying &#x201C;feared the Lord&#x201D; would be <italic>yare&#x2019;u me&#x2019;et Adonai</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn190">190</xref></sup> Obadiah used a short form when he said, <italic>yare et Adonai</italic> (fear the Lord) (I Kings 18:12).<sup><xref rid="fn191">191</xref></sup> It is for this reason that the word <italic>nora</italic> (revered)<sup><xref rid="fn192">192</xref></sup> does not come in the <italic>nifal</italic> form as the words <italic>nolad</italic> (was born) (I Chron. 2:3), <italic>nishbar</italic> (broken) (Ps. 51:19), and <italic>ve-nidkeh</italic> (and contrite) (<italic>Ibid.</italic>) do.<sup><xref rid="fn193">193</xref></sup> The intelligent will understand why.<sup><xref rid="fn194">194</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND PHARAOH CHARGED.

<ftnote id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> This poem is found in <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 38. The printed editions omit it as they do many of the other poems which introduce Torah portions in I.E.&#x2019;s <italic>Commentary</italic> on Exodus. Some manuscripts open with the following introduction: Abraham&#x2019;s commentary on the book of Exodus, finished in the year 4913 (1152-53 C.E.), is as precious as onyx. However, other commentaries give the date 4927 (1166-67 C.E.) as the date of the manuscript&#x2019;s completion. E. Levine notes, &#x201C;Some writers have held that the 1152-53 date refers to the long commentary whereas the inscription 1166-67 refers to the short commentary; others have maintained that the 1152-53 refers to the short commentary and the 1166-67 refers to the long commentary which was written precisely between 1159 and 1167 C.E.&#x201D; See Foreword.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> In Hebrew, <italic>ba-aron be-kemutzot</italic>. The reference is to I.E.&#x2019;s commentary on Exodus. Commenting on the word <italic>ba-aron</italic> (in a coffin) in Gen. 50:26, I.E. explains, &#x201C;The reason why <italic>ba-aron</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> is that it signifies the coffin which he had prepared for himself.&#x201D; (See notes on Gen. 50:26.) The word <italic>aron</italic> can refer to an ark or to a coffin. I.E. is being a bit morbid.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> The book of Exodus opens with the word <italic>ve-elleh</italic> which literally means, and these are, and is so translated by I.E. The question thus arises, why open a book with a connective? Indeed, Deut. 1:1 opens with <italic>elleh ha-devarim</italic> and not with <italic>ve-elleh ha-devarim</italic>. Similarly, Exodus should have read <italic>elleh shemot</italic> and not <italic>ve-elleh shemot</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> Genesis concludes by relating that <italic>Joseph saw the children of the third generation</italic>, i.e., that he was fruitful. However, it does not tell us about the fate of his brothers. The latter is related to us at the beginning of Exodus where we are told that <italic>the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly</italic> (Ex. 1:7). Thus the opening part of Exodus is connected to the closing section of Genesis. Hence the connective <italic>vav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5"><sup>5</sup> The word <italic>to&#x2019;evot</italic> (abominations) is feminine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6"><sup>6</sup> It too is employed both with the masculine and the feminine.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn10"><sup>10</sup> Hence the word <italic>shemot</italic> can be a plural masculine. I.E. makes this point because generally speaking only feminine plurals end in a <italic>tav</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn19"><sup>19</sup> Gen. 46:8-27 lists the seventy descendants of Jacob who came to Egypt. Women are not enumerated. In fact they are specifically excluded (Gen. 46: 26). This proves that <italic>beto</italic> does not mean one&#x2019;s wife.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn20"><sup>20</sup> The Pentateuch states that on the Day of Atonement the high priest shall make atonement <italic>for himself and for his household. Prima facie</italic>, &#x201C;his household&#x201D; seems to refer to the wife of the high priest. See end of note 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn21"><sup>21</sup> The Torah states that the high priest shall make atonement <italic>for himself, and for his household and for all the assembly of Israel</italic> (Lev. 16:18). According to the Talmud the making of atonement refers to confession of sins (<italic>viduy</italic>). Cf. <italic>Yoma</italic> 36b. The three confessions offered by the high priest were on behalf of himself (<italic>for himself</italic>), on behalf of the house of Aaron (<italic>his household</italic>), and on behalf of the people of Israel (<italic>and for all the assembly of Israel</italic>).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn23"><sup>23</sup> The <italic>bet, vav, kaf</italic>, and <italic>lamed</italic> are prepositional prefixes. They are usually vocalized with a mobile <italic>sheva</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn24"><sup>24</sup> <italic>Vav</italic> is the sign of the <italic>shuruk</italic>. I.E. explains that a <italic>shuruk</italic> is sounded as if spelled <italic>alef vav;</italic> i.e., it is pronounced ooh.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn25"><sup>25</sup> The quiescent letters are the <italic>alef, heh, vav</italic>, and <italic>yod</italic>. These letters surrender their consonantal function by coalescing with surrounding vowel signs at the end of a syllable or word. Thus the <italic>yod</italic> following a <italic>chirik</italic> or <italic>tzere</italic> is not sounded as a consonant. Hence the term quiescent letters.</ftnote>

I.E. assumed that Scripture would not report someone as being the ancestor of a person not yet born. Hence Eber in this verse cannot refer to a person. It refers to those born on one of the sides of the Euphrates. This interpretation contradicts the one I.E. gives in Genesis and elsewhere in Exodus. Cf. Gen. 10:21 and Ex. 21:2. Krinsky suggests emending &#x201C;hence&#x201D; to &#x201C;or.&#x201D; In other words, I.E. offers an alternative interpretation to the one he gave in Genesis and will offer later on in Exodus. Filwarg, on the other hand, suggests emending the text to read: Hence they err who say that <italic>the children of Eber</italic>, in <italic>the father of all the children of Eber</italic>, refers to those who came from the side of the river. For the side of the river refers to one of the sides of the river. In other words, <italic>ever</italic> cannot refer only to the western bank of the river where Abraham came from. A river has two sides and <italic>ever</italic> might refer to the eastern bank of the river, which is not the place that the Hebrews originally came from.</ftnote>

In the &#x201C;Hebrew script&#x201D; they are totally different. The fact that the Torah substitutes a <italic>heh</italic> for a <italic>tav</italic> because they resemble each other shows that the Torah was originally written in the Assyrian script. Historically speaking, the opinion that the Torah was given in &#x201C;Hebrew script&#x201D; is right, for all Hebrew writing extant from the period of the first commonwealth is in the &#x201C;Hebrew script.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<p>Ben Zuta<sup><xref rid="fn220">23</xref></sup> says whoever relates a story will not out of respect mention the most honored first.<sup><xref rid="fn221">24</xref></sup> Therefore when Scripture states, <italic>and she</italic> (Jochebed) <italic>bore unto Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister</italic> (Num. 26:59), it indicates that Miriam was the youngest.<sup><xref rid="fn222">25</xref></sup> Now the &#x201C;blind one&#x201D; (Ben Zuta) forgot Shem, Ham, and Japheth, concerning whom it is written, <italic>and Noah begot Shem, Ham and Japheth</italic> (Gen. 5:32). Now Japheth was the eldest of the three.<sup><xref rid="fn223">26</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife</italic> (Gen. 49:31) even though Sarah was buried in the cave of Machpelah thirty-eight years<sup><xref rid="fn224">27</xref></sup> before Abraham was interred there.</p>
<p>Note that the <italic>nun</italic> is often dropped or is swallowed by a <italic>dagesh</italic> when it is the first root letter of a verb, as in the case of the <italic>nun</italic> of <italic>gesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn225">28</xref></sup> in <italic>gesh holah</italic> (stand back) (Gen. 19:9) and <italic>va-yiggash</italic> (came near)<sup><xref rid="fn226">29</xref></sup> in <italic>Then Judah came near unto him</italic> (Gen. 44:18). The <italic>nun</italic> is also dropped when it serves as the middle letter of a root,<sup><xref rid="fn227">30</xref></sup> as in the case of <italic>af</italic> (anger)<sup><xref rid="fn228">31</xref></sup> in <italic>And anger also went up against Israel</italic> (Ps. 78:21). Observe, the middle <italic>nun</italic> is swallowed. Therefore the <italic>peh</italic> of <italic>appo</italic> (his wrath) in <italic>that his wrath was kindled</italic> (Gen. 39:19) and the <italic>peh</italic> of <italic>appekah</italic> (thine anger) in <italic>Thine anger is turned away</italic> (Is. 12:1) receive a <italic>dagesh</italic>. The same is true of the <italic>nun</italic> of the root <italic>nun, tav, nun</italic> in the word <italic>titti</italic> (that I give) (Gen. 29:19), for <italic>titti</italic> is like <italic>tinti</italic><sup><xref rid="fn229">32</xref></sup> because its final <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn230">33</xref></sup> is not a root letter. It is rather like the <italic>tavs</italic> of <italic>shivti</italic> (my downsitting) (Ps. 139:2), <italic>lekhti</italic> (when I went) (I Kings 2:8), and <italic>lidti</italic> (I delivered) (I Kings 3:18).<sup><xref rid="fn231">34</xref></sup> It is also so at the end of the word,<sup><xref rid="fn232">35</xref></sup> as in <italic>tet</italic> (to put) in <italic>to put the dread of thee</italic> (Deut. 2:25) and in <italic>titti</italic> (that I give) in <italic>that I give her to thee</italic> (Gen. 29:19). The same is true of nouns. The word for daughter (<italic>bat</italic>) should have been <italic>banah</italic> since the feminine of <italic>ben</italic> (son) is <italic>banah</italic>. However, in this case it would have been confused with the verb <italic>banah</italic> (hath built), as in <italic>that hath built</italic> (banah) <italic>a new house</italic> (Deut. 20:5). A <italic>tav</italic> was therefore substituted for the <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn233">36</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>givirah</italic> (lady) and <italic>geveret</italic> (lady) as well as to <italic>atarah</italic> (crown) and <italic>ateret</italic> (crown) in which we find both the construct and the absolute forms used in the absolute.<sup><xref rid="fn234">37</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ateret</italic> (crown of) in <italic>A crown of glory</italic> (Prov. 4:7). It should be noted that the <italic>nun</italic> was also dropped for the sake of easing the pronunciation of the word.<sup><xref rid="fn235">38</xref></sup> Hence the word is enunciated <italic>bat</italic> (daughter). The word <italic>bitto</italic> (his daughter) in <italic>Rachel his daughter</italic> (Gen. 29:6) is similar to the word <italic>amitto</italic> (his truth) which is the word <italic>emet</italic> (truth) with the third person pronominal suffix.<sup><xref rid="fn236">39</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>chasdo va-amitto</italic> (His mercy and His truth) (Gen. 24:27). Thus the <italic>tav</italic> is the sign of the feminine and the <italic>nun</italic> is swallowed up.<sup><xref rid="fn237">40</xref></sup> The plural of truth is <italic>emunot</italic>, and not <italic>amitot</italic> or <italic>amitiyot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn238">41</xref></sup> Similarly, the plural of daughters is <italic>banot</italic>, not <italic>batot</italic> or <italic>battim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn239">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE WOMAN CONCEIVED. Scripture does not mention the birth of Miriam and Aaron because there was nothing special about their birth.<sup><xref rid="fn240">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the word <italic>tov</italic> (good)<sup><xref rid="fn241">44</xref></sup> is used with reference to a mature man it probably refers to the soul, as in &#x201C;good with the Lord and good with man.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn242">45</xref></sup> Or it may refer to the eye, as in a <italic>bountiful</italic> (tov) <italic>eye</italic> (Prov. 22:9).<sup><xref rid="fn243">46</xref></sup> It may also refer to the body or its form, as in &#x201C;of good form,<sup><xref rid="fn244">47</xref></sup> and good to look upon.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn245">48</xref></sup> However, because we find it used with regard to a child, viz., <italic>that he was a goodly</italic> (tov) <italic>child</italic>, we can only explain it as referring to the child&#x2019;s form, that he was better than all who are born.<sup><xref rid="fn246">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>THREE MONTHS. Some say that Moses was born in the seventh month following his conception.<sup><xref rid="fn247">50</xref></sup> However, this interpretation like so many others is Midrashic,<sup><xref rid="fn248">51</xref></sup> for the Egyptians had no way of determining when the woman<sup><xref rid="fn249">52</xref></sup> conceived. In my opinion Scripture relates the months that she was able to hide the child<sup><xref rid="fn250">53</xref></sup> since it is impossible for anyone to predict when a women will give birth.<sup><xref rid="fn251">54</xref></sup> It is also far-fetched to say that Moses was born in the seventh month following conception because those so born are undersized.<sup><xref rid="fn252">55</xref></sup> Those born in the eleventh month are healthier and live longer, as most children are born close to the ninth month.<sup><xref rid="fn253">56</xref></sup> One who knows the time of conception is able to ascertain the time of birth, and one who knows the time of birth can ascertain the time of conception. This was established by the ancients. I myself have tried it five times.<sup><xref rid="fn254">57</xref></sup> For the degree and place of the moon and its constellation at the moment of conception is also the degree of the constellation that flowers at the moment of begetting The degree which flowers at the moment of impregnation will also be the degree at which the moon will be found at the time of birth.<sup><xref rid="fn255">58</xref></sup> Now the time set aside<sup><xref rid="fn256">59</xref></sup> for carrying a child is two hundred and fifty nine and a third days.<sup><xref rid="fn257">60</xref></sup> The median time for pregnancy is two hundred and seventy-three days.<sup><xref rid="fn258">61</xref></sup> The maximum time for being with child is two hundred and eighty-seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn259">62</xref></sup> Those learned in astrology will admit this.<sup><xref rid="fn260">63</xref></sup> The birth of the tribes<sup><xref rid="fn261">64</xref></sup> does not refute this,<sup><xref rid="fn262">65</xref></sup> because the order of their listing is no proof that they were born prematurely.<sup><xref rid="fn263">66</xref></sup> We find many such instances in the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn264">67</xref></sup> It is therefore possible that Rachel gave her handmaid to Jacob when Simeon was born, that Issachar was born before Asher,<sup><xref rid="fn265">68</xref></sup> and that Dinah was Zebulun&#x2019;s twin.<sup><xref rid="fn266">69</xref></sup> Hence the phrase <italic>and afterwards</italic> in <italic>and afterwards she bore a daughter</italic> (Gen. 30:21) is similar to <italic>And after that came forth his brother</italic> (Gen. 25:26). For <italic>and she conceived</italic> is not mentioned for each one. Also, <italic>And it came to pass, when the seasons were come about</italic> (I Sam. 1:20) refers to three seasons.<sup><xref rid="fn267">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. [HIDE HIM.] The <italic>tzadi</italic> of <italic>hatzefino</italic> (hide him), like the <italic>kof</italic> in the word <italic>yikkrekh</italic> (happen to thee) in <italic>there shall no punishment happen to thee</italic> (I Sam. 28:10), receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> so that these words may be clearly pronounced.<sup><xref rid="fn268">71</xref></sup> The <italic>peh</italic> in <italic>hatzefino</italic> should have received a <italic>dagesh</italic>. However, it does not because the <italic>tzadi</italic> is vocalized with a mobile <italic>sheva. Hatzefino</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic> infinitive. There is no reason to speculate as to why Jochebed did not hide him for a longer period of time.<sup><xref rid="fn269">72</xref></sup> Perhaps the Egyptian neighbors heard his voice,<sup><xref rid="fn270">73</xref></sup> for the Hebrews were not the only inhabitants of the land of Rameses.<sup><xref rid="fn271">74</xref></sup> For it is written, <italic>but every women shall ask of her neighbor</italic> (Ex. 3:22).<sup><xref rid="fn272">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AN ARK OF BULRUSHES.] The words <italic>tevat gome</italic> (an ark of bulrushes) are penultimately accented because the cantillical note is placed on the first syllable of the word <italic>gome</italic> (bulrushes).<sup><xref rid="fn273">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND DAUBED IT. The <italic>heh of va-tachmerah</italic> (and daubed it) is silent. It is like the <italic>heh</italic> of the word <italic>lah</italic> (it) in <italic>and called it</italic> (lah) <italic>Nobah, after his own name</italic> (Num. 32:42).<sup><xref rid="fn274">77</xref></sup> The word <italic>va-tachmerah</italic> (and daubed it) is derived from the word <italic>ba-chemar</italic> (with slime).<sup><xref rid="fn275">78</xref></sup> <italic>Chemar</italic> (slime) is a red sticky clay which is found in the Land of Israel. The word <italic>chemar</italic> (slime) in <italic>full of slime pits</italic> (Gen. 14:10) is similar. This substance is called <italic>al chamara</italic> in Arabic. Jochebed did this<sup><xref rid="fn276">79</xref></sup> for she said, &#x201C;Let me not look upon the death of the child.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn277">80</xref></sup> Perhaps the sister<sup><xref rid="fn278">81</xref></sup> of Moses prophesied that she do this.<sup><xref rid="fn279">82</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s thoughts are very deep. Who can know His secrets? By Him alone are actions weighed.<sup><xref rid="fn280">83</xref></sup> Perhaps God arranged things so that Moses would grow up in a royal house and his spirit would thereby be exalted through learning and practice.<sup><xref rid="fn281">84</xref></sup> He would thus not possess a base spirit habituated to being in the house of slaves. Do you not see that Moses killed an Egyptian because the latter committed an act of violence<sup><xref rid="fn282">85</xref></sup> and that he saved the daughters of Midian from the shepherds because they were acting violently in trying to water their flocks with the water which the women had drawn?<sup><xref rid="fn283">86</xref></sup> One more thing: had Moses grown up among his brothers and had they known him from his youth they would not have feared him because they would have considered him as one of themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn284">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE FLAGS (<italic>BA-SUF</italic>). Compare, <italic>The reeds and flags</italic> (va-suf) <italic>shall wither</italic> (Is. 19:6). <italic>Suf</italic> refers to a plant that grows in the Nile.</p>
<p>4. AND HIS SISTER STOOD AFAR OFF. The word <italic>va-tetatzav</italic> (stood) is irregular because a missing silent letter<sup><xref rid="fn285">88</xref></sup> has been substituted for a <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn286">89</xref></sup> between the two <italic>tavs</italic>.</p>
<p>Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen<sup><xref rid="fn287">90</xref></sup> says that a <italic>tav</italic> is suffixed to the words <italic>laredet</italic> (to descend) and <italic>la-geshet</italic> (to approach) because the first root letter of these words is missing.<sup><xref rid="fn288">91</xref></sup> That is also the case with the word <italic>la-da&#x2019;at</italic> (to know).<sup><xref rid="fn289">92</xref></sup> This word is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because the <italic>ayin</italic> is a guttural.<sup><xref rid="fn290">93</xref></sup> Now in the word <italic>le-de&#x2019;ah</italic> (to know)<sup><xref rid="fn291">94</xref></sup> the <italic>tav</italic> was changed to a <italic>heh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn292">95</xref></sup> as in the case of the word <italic>tenah</italic> (rehearsed)<sup><xref rid="fn293">96</xref></sup> in <italic>Whose majesty is rehearsed above the heavens</italic> (Ps. 8:2).</p>
<p>5. AND THE DAUGHTER OF PHARAOH CAME DOWN. From her palace.</p>
<p>TO BATHE IN THE RIVER. As was the custom of Egyptian women. Scripture notes that her maidens walked by the riverside &#x2014; the meaning of <italic>yad</italic> (side, place) here is the same as that of <italic>yad</italic> (place) in <italic>Thou shalt have a place</italic> (Deut. 23:13)<sup><xref rid="fn294">97</xref></sup> &#x2014; because it goes on to say that she sent her handmaid (Amatah), who was one of the maidens, to fetch the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn295">98</xref></sup> For a princess would not go among the flags, and the ark was placed far from the shore so that no one passing by would touch it. Furthermore, from a grammatical point of view the word <italic>amah</italic> (handmaid) cannot mean an arm, because its <italic>mem</italic> does not have a <italic>dagesh</italic> while the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>ammah</italic> (cubit) in <italic>A cubit shall be the length thereof</italic> (Gen. 30:2) does.<sup><xref rid="fn296">99</xref></sup> Additionally, <italic>ammah</italic> (cubit) in <italic>A cubit shall be the length thereof</italic> refers to a measure and not to an arm.<sup><xref rid="fn297">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND SHE OPENED IT, AND SAW IT. After stating, <italic>and saw it</italic>, Scripture goes on to elucidate further.<sup><xref rid="fn298">101</xref></sup> Our verse is thus similar to <italic>And the house of David shall be as a godlike being, As the angel of the Lord before them</italic> (Zech. 12:8).<sup><xref rid="fn299">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BEHOLD A BOY THAT WEPT. Moses&#x2019; limbs were as large as if he were a fully developed boy.<sup><xref rid="fn300">103</xref></sup> Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter noticed that Moses was circumcised.<sup><xref rid="fn301">104</xref></sup> She took pity on him because of his beauty.<sup><xref rid="fn302">105</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>that he was a goodly child</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn303">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THEN SAID&#x2026;THAT SHE MAY NURSE. The first <italic>yod</italic> in roots whose first letter is a <italic>yod</italic> occasionally change,<sup><xref rid="fn304">107</xref></sup> as evidenced in the word <italic>todi&#x2019;a</italic> (you shall inform) which comes from the root <italic>yod, dalet, ayin</italic> and is spelled with a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn305">108</xref></sup> In other cases a silent missing letter<sup><xref rid="fn306">109</xref></sup> which is at times written and at times omitted<sup><xref rid="fn307">110</xref></sup> is substituted for the <italic>yod</italic> and placed between the prefix and the middle root letter. This is the case with the word <italic>ve-tenek</italic> (that she may nurse)<sup><xref rid="fn308">111</xref></sup> in <italic>that she may nurse the child for thee</italic>.</p>
<p>8. AND PHARAOH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER SAID TO HER: GO. <italic>Lekhi</italic> (go) is like <italic>shevi</italic> (sit).<sup><xref rid="fn309">112</xref></sup> These words are the imperative forms of <italic>va-yelekh</italic> (and he went) and <italic>va-yeshev</italic> (and he dwelt).</p>
<p>9. TAKE. <italic>Helikhi</italic> (take) is like <italic>heniki</italic> (nurse)<sup><xref rid="fn310">113</xref></sup> because the roots <italic>yod, lamed, kaf</italic> and <italic>heh, lamed, kaf</italic> are two roots with one meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn311">114</xref></sup> For the <italic>heh</italic> is not one of the implied vowel letters.<sup><xref rid="fn312">115</xref></sup> Therefore the other <italic>heh</italic> is also like it.<sup><xref rid="fn313">116</xref></sup> Furthermore, the <italic>alef</italic> and likewise the <italic>yod</italic> and the <italic>vav</italic> are found in the middle of a word at times written and at times silent, that is, pronounced but unwritten,<sup><xref rid="fn314">117</xref></sup> but the <italic>heh</italic> is always visible when in the middle of a word. The words <italic>be-latehem</italic> (with their secret arts) (Ex. 7:22) and <italic>be-lahatehem</italic> (with their secret arts) (Ex. 7:11) are not, as I will explain,<sup><xref rid="fn315">118</xref></sup> one and the same word.<sup><xref rid="fn316">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND PHARAOH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER SAID. Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>helikhi</italic> (take) is a composite of two words.<sup><xref rid="fn317">120</xref></sup> However, the Gaon spoke incorrectly. It is, as I have noted, one word following the paradigm of <italic>ve-henikehu</italic> (and nurse it) in <italic>and nurse it for me</italic>. The word is in the <italic>hifil</italic>. The Gaon also said that <italic>helikhi</italic> is a composite of the words <italic>he</italic> and <italic>lakh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn318">121</xref></sup> the meaning of <italic>he</italic> being the same as <italic>he</italic> (behold) in <italic>Behold</italic> (heh), <italic>I will also bring thy way upon thy head</italic> (Ezek. 16:43).<sup><xref rid="fn319">122</xref></sup> However, we do not find the form <italic>lekhi</italic> used in Scripture when a female is being addressed. The form employed by Scripture is <italic>lakh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn320">123</xref></sup> <italic>Helikhi</italic> (take) is thus one word.</p>
<p>AND NURSED IT. <italic>Va-tenikehu</italic> comes from a root wherein the middle radical is dropped and the other two remain.<sup><xref rid="fn321">124</xref></sup> Observe, we have in our verse two roots with one meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn322">125</xref></sup> It is the same case with the word <italic>hetivi</italic> (make good) in <italic>make good melody</italic> (Is. 23:16) which is an imperative following the paradigm of <italic>helikhi</italic> (take) and the word <italic>hetivu</italic> (they have well) in <italic>they have well said all that they have spoken</italic> (Deut. 15:25), which is like <italic>hevi&#x2019;u</italic> (they brought) in <italic>And they brought yet unto him</italic> (Ex. 36:3), which is a word that drops its middle root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn323">126</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND HE BECAME HER SON. This is similar to <italic>And these are the sons of Michal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn324">127</xref></sup> and to <italic>Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel</italic> (Ezra 3:2; Haggai 1:1). Zerubbabel was the son of Pedaiah the brother of Shealtiel (II Chron. 3:17-19). He is called the son of Shealtiel because Shealtiel raised him.</p>
<p>[MOSES.] <italic>Moshe</italic> (Moses) is a Hebrew form of an Egyptian name. Moses was called <italic>Monyos</italic> in Egyptian. The name is so written in a book on agriculture which was translated from Egyptian into Arabic. This is also recorded in the books of the Greek scholars. Perhaps the daughter of Pharaoh learned our language, or she asked some one for its Hebrew version.<sup><xref rid="fn325">128</xref></sup> Do not be perplexed as to why <italic>moshe</italic> was not called <italic>mashuy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn326">129</xref></sup> as nouns do not keep their forms as verbs do.<sup><xref rid="fn327">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THAT HE WENT OUT UNTO HIS BRETHREN. The Egyptians,<sup><xref rid="fn328">131</xref></sup> for he was in the king&#x2019;s palace.<sup><xref rid="fn329">132</xref></sup> <italic>One of his brethren</italic> means one of his family, as in <italic>for we are brethren</italic> (Gen. 13:6).<sup><xref rid="fn330">133</xref></sup> Our clause is to be so understood because Scripture has already noted that the man was a Hebrew.<sup><xref rid="fn331">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. STRIVING. <italic>Nitzim</italic> (striving) is a <italic>nifal</italic> adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn332">135</xref></sup> The complete form is <italic>nintzim</italic> (striving).<sup><xref rid="fn333">136</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>nirim</italic> (seen).<sup><xref rid="fn334">137</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO HIM THAT DID WRONG. To him that acted violently.</p>
<p>14. SAYEST THOU TO KILL ME.<sup><xref rid="fn335">138</xref></sup> Sayest thou in thy heart.<sup><xref rid="fn336">139</xref></sup></p>
<p>SURELY. <italic>Akhen</italic> (surely) means if so.</p>
<p>15. HEARD. The land of Midian was subservient to Pharaoh; hence Moses had to herd sheep and not live among people and be recognized.<sup><xref rid="fn337">140</xref></sup> It was at the time that his youngest son was born that God told Moses that Pharaoh and his servants from whom he had fled were dead. Upon hearing this Moses said, <italic>and (God) delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh</italic> (Ex. 18:4), as Moses feared Pharaoh as long as Pharaoh lived.<sup><xref rid="fn338">141</xref></sup> After noting <italic>and (Moses) dwelt in the land of Midian</italic>, Scripture goes back and explains why Moses dwelt in Midian.<sup><xref rid="fn339">142</xref></sup> Moses first sat down before the specified well.<sup><xref rid="fn340">143</xref></sup> It is like <italic>And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba and went to Haran</italic> (Gen. 28:10). After stating the aforementioned the Pentateuch backsteps and states, <italic>And he lighted upon the place</italic>, etc. (Gen. 28:11).<sup><xref rid="fn341">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>NOW THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN. The reference is to Jethro and not Reuel.<sup><xref rid="fn342">145</xref></sup> The term <italic>kohen</italic> (priest) in Scripture refers to one who ministers either to the Lord or before an idol. <italic>That they may minister unto Me in the priest&#x2019;s office</italic> (Ex. 28:41)<sup><xref rid="fn343">146</xref></sup> and <italic>the priests of the Lord</italic> (Is. 61:6) are proof of this. Jethro, as I will explain, was a priest of the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn344">147</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND THE SHEPHERDS CAME. The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>va-yegareshum</italic> (and drove them away) has the same meaning as a <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn345">148</xref></sup> If <italic>va-yegareshum</italic> was spelled with a <italic>nun</italic>, the <italic>nun</italic> might be confused with a superfluous <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn346">149</xref></sup> Similarly, the word <italic>tzonam</italic> (their flock) is spelled with a <italic>mem</italic> so as not to combine two <italic>nuns</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn347">150</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND WHEN THEY CAME TO REUEL THEIR FATHER. Reuel was their grandfather, while Jethro, who was also known as Hobab, was the father-in-law of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn348">151</xref></sup> This is evidenced in these verses: <italic>even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses</italic> (Judges 4:11); <italic>And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite</italic> (Num. 10:29).</p>
<p>19. AND THEY SAID. They embellished what Moses had actually done.<sup><xref rid="fn349">152</xref></sup> Or the water which they had drawn was insufficient for their flocks.<sup><xref rid="fn350">153</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn212"><sup>15</sup> Jacob came to Egypt at the age of 130 (Gen. 47:9). Joseph was 39 at that time: he was 30 when he stood before Pharaoh (Gen. 41:46), and seven years of plenty and two of famine passed between the time that he first stood before Pharaoh and Jacob&#x2019;s arrival in Egypt (Gen. 45:11). Jacob was thus 91 years older than Joseph. Joseph was six years younger than Reuben since Reuben was born in the eighth year of Jacob&#x2019;s stay with Laban, and Joseph in the fourteenth year of that stay (See I.E. on Gen. 30:23 and the notes thereto). Thus Reuben was 45 years old when he came to Egypt, and Jacob 85 when he begot Reuben.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn213"><sup>16</sup> Gen. 42:46.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn214"><sup>17</sup> The Israelites were to be strangers in a foreign land for 400 years (Gen. 15:13). I.E. believes that those 400 years began with the birth of Isaac. It was a 190 years from Isaac&#x2019;s birth to the descent of Jacob to Egypt. If we subtract 190 from 400 we are left with 210.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn215"><sup>18</sup> Seventy years passed (actually 71 years, I.E. prefers to use a round number) between the time that Jacob descended to Egypt and Joseph&#x2019;s death. Thus 140 years are left from the 400 years. Joseph was 39 when his father came to Egypt. He died at the age of 110 (Gen. 50:26). Thus Joseph lived for another 71 years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn216"><sup>19</sup> Levi was Leah&#x2019;s third son. Assuming that Leah had Reuben, Simeon, and Levi in three consecutive years, I.E. concludes that Levi was two years younger than Reuben. Hence he was 43 years old when he came to Egypt since Reuben as previously noted, was then 45.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn217"><sup>20</sup> Levi lived 137 years (Ex. 6:15). Levi was three years older than Joseph (notes 15 and 19). Thus when Joseph died at the age of 110, Levi was 113. Hence Levi outlived Joseph by 24 years. I.E.&#x2019;s figure of 22 years is inexact.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn218"><sup>21</sup> The fact that Joseph lived 110 years enables us to establish that from Isaac&#x2019;s birth to the death of Levi, only 118 out of the 400 years remained.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn234"><sup>37</sup> <italic>Bat</italic> is usually in the absolute. However, its form is that of a word in the construct. We find the same thing with the word <italic>geveret.

<ftnote id="fn235"><sup>38</sup> Not only was the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>banah</italic> changed to a <italic>tav</italic>, but its <italic>nun</italic> was dropped. Thus <italic>banah</italic> became <italic>bat</italic>.</ftnote>

I.E.&#x2019;s intention here was to explain the form <italic>bat</italic> in verse 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn240"><sup>43</sup> It appears from our verse that Moses was Amram and Jochebed&#x2019;s firstborn as Aaron and Miriam&#x2019;s births are not mentioned. However, this cannot be the case since we have already seen that they were older than Moses. I.E. explains that there was no reason for Scripture to tell of their births as nothing extraordinary happened when they came into this world. However, when Moses was born he was put into the Nile and discovered by Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn241"><sup>44</sup> Moses is described as &#x201C; a goodly (<italic>tov</italic>) child,&#x201D; hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn247"><sup>50</sup> The Bible tells us that Moses&#x2019; mother hid him for three months. The question arises, why did Jochebed hide Moses for three months? Why not two or four or five months? These commentaries assume that the Egyptians knew when Jochebed conceived and that they would come to check on the sex of her child nine months later. Hence they assume that Moses was born six months after conception and his mother hid him for three months, i.e., until the time the Egyptians would come to check the birth and ascertain the sex of the child. Cf. Rashi and Rashbam.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn248"><sup>51</sup> It looks like a literal interpretation but upon reflection it is Midrashic.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn249"><sup>52</sup> Jochebed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn250"><sup>53</sup> Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn251"><sup>54</sup> In other words, the Egyptians had no way of knowing when Jochebed would give birth just by looking at her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn252"><sup>55</sup> Literally, &#x201C;because those then born are short.&#x201D; However, Moses, as the verse tells us, was a perfect specimen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn253"><sup>56</sup> I.E. obviously believed that a woman can carry a fetus for 11 months. His point is that the longer a child spends in the womb the healthier it will be. Hence Moses, who was &#x201C;good,&#x201D; could not have been premature. It is interesting that I.E. does not consider the possibility of divine intervention in making Moses a perfect specimen though born prematurely.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn254"><sup>57</sup> I.E. might be referring to his personal life. If this is the case then we may conclude that he had fathered five children by the time he composed the long commentary on Exodus. See the introduction to Vol. 1 of this work. It is also possible that people consulted I.E. to make horoscopes for their children and that the reference is to the latter. In this case we, of course, have no hint as to how many children I.E. had.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn255"><sup>58</sup> A flowering constellation is one that is present at the moment of conception. The point is that the moon will be in the same place in the sky and will have the same constellation as its background at birth as it did at conception. Hence if one knows the moment of conception, one can ascertain the time of one&#x2019;s birth. Similarly, if one knows the time of birth, one can figure out the time of conception.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn256"><sup>59</sup> I.E. reads, <italic>ha-kotzev</italic>, (the time set aside). However, since I.E. gives three time periods, what he must mean is the minimum time. Filwarg suggests reading <italic>ha-katan</italic> (the minimum) in place of <italic>ha-kotzev</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn261"><sup>64</sup> Jacob&#x2019;s 12 sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn262"><sup>65</sup> Jacob begot 12 sons from four wives in seven years. The Bible lists their births in succession. The Midrash assumes that none of Jacob&#x2019;s wives were pregnant at the same time. Hence it appears that they were born seven months apart since there are 84 months in seven years, and 84 divided by 12 is 7. See I.E. on Gen. 30:23 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn263"><sup>66</sup> The interpretation that Jacob&#x2019;s children were born seven months apart is based on the theory that their births are listed in Genesis in the order of their occurrence; i.e., Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah were born first, to Leah. Rachel then gave Bilhah to Jacob, and Bilhah bore Dan. And so on with the rest of the sons of Jacob. I.E. says that the latter is not necessarily the case. It is possible that Bilhah was given to Jacob when Simeon was born and that Scripture does not note this earlier because it wanted to record that Leah had four sons before she &#x201C;left off bearing.&#x201D; See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 30:23 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn264"><sup>67</sup> There are many instances in Scripture where what happened later is listed first and what happened earlier is listed later.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn265"><sup>68</sup> In Gen. 30:13 Asher&#x2019;s birth is recorded before that of Issaschar (Gen. 30:18).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn266"><sup>69</sup> After recording that Leah gave birth to Zebulun, Genesis tells us, <italic>And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah</italic> (Gen. 30:21). <italic>Prima facie</italic>, it appears that Dinah was born some time after the birth of Zebulun. I.E. argues that this is not so. He suggests that <italic>afterwards</italic> means a few moments later, as it does in Gen. 30:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn267"><sup>70</sup> The reference is to the birth of the prophet Samuel. According to the Talmudic sage Mar Zutra, Samuel was born six months and two days after he was conceived. The Bible tells us that Hannah, Samuel&#x2019;s mother, prayed for a son and that &#x201C;<italic>seasons</italic> (tekufat) <italic>of days came to pass, and Hannah conceived and bore a son</italic> (I Sam. 20). Mar Zutra explains that <italic>tekufot</italic> (seasons) refers to six months (a <italic>tekufah</italic>, a season is three months) and days, to two days. Cf. <italic>Rosh Ha-Shanah</italic> 11a. I.E. disagrees. According to him, <italic>seasons</italic> refers to three seasons (nine months). Hence Samuel was not born prematurely.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn268"><sup>71</sup> A letter with a <italic>dagesh</italic> in it is emphasized; i.e., the word is sounded <italic>hatzefino</italic> (<italic>dagesh</italic> in <italic>tzadi</italic>) rather than <italic>hatzpino</italic> (no <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>tzadi</italic>). I.E. makes this point because there is no grammatical reason for a <italic>dagesh</italic> to be placed in <italic>hatzefino</italic> or <italic>yikkrekh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn269"><sup>72</sup> I.E. comments thus because he disagrees with the exegetes who believed that Jochebed carried Moses for six months and hid him for three months because the Egyptians were about to come and check on the baby&#x2019;s birth and sex. See note 50.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn270"><sup>73</sup> Hence Jochebed could no longer hide him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn271"><sup>74</sup> There were also Egyptians living there and they would report the birth of the child. I.E. does not believe that a Hebrew would inform on a Hebrew.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn272"><sup>75</sup> The meaning of the verse is: but every Hebrew woman shall ask of her Egyptian neighbor. We thus see that the Hebrews had Egyptian neighbors.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn273"><sup>76</sup> I.E. points out that not only <italic>gome</italic> is penultimately accented; so is <italic>tevat</italic>. The problem presented by the latter is that <italic>tevah</italic> (<italic>tevat</italic> is <italic>tevah</italic> in the construct) is usually ultimately accented. I.E. explains that when two words are connected by cantillical notes and the second word is penultimately accented, so is the first word. This is so even though the word is ordinarily ultimately accented.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn274"><sup>77</sup> According to the rules of Hebrew grammar, a <italic>heh</italic> which serves as a pronominal suffix is vocalized with a <italic>mappik</italic> and is thus sounded. However, this is not the case with the pronominal <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>va-tachmerah</italic>. I.E. thus points out that the <italic>mappik</italic> is occasionally omitted from the <italic>heh</italic> which serves as a pronominal suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn275"><sup>78</sup> It comes from the same root. In other words, the verb <italic>va-tachmerah</italic> is a denominative of <italic>chemar</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn279"><sup>82</sup> Miriam was a prophetess. It is possible that Miriam was instructed by God to tell her mother to do this, that, as I.E. goes on to say, the Lord arranged it that Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter find Moses and bring him up in the royal palace.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn286"><sup>89</sup> I.E. believes that the root of <italic>va-tetatzav</italic> is <italic>yod, tzadi, bet</italic>, and that its <italic>tav</italic> prefix is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic> rather than with a <italic>chirik</italic> to compensate for the missing <italic>yod</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn287"><sup>90</sup> Moses ibn Gikatilla, an eleventh-century Spanish philologist and Bible commentator.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn288"><sup>91</sup> The root of <italic>la-redet</italic> is <italic>yod, resh, dalet</italic>. The stem of <italic>la-geshet</italic> is <italic>nun, gimel, shin</italic>. The <italic>yod</italic> is dropped in the infinitive and according to Rabbi Moses is compensated for by the <italic>tav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn289"><sup>92</sup> From the root <italic>yod, dalet, ayin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn290"><sup>93</sup> Hence the word is pronounced <italic>la-da&#x2019;at</italic> and not <italic>la-de&#x2019;et</italic>. I.E. makes this point because he wants to show that <italic>la-da&#x2019;at</italic> and <italic>la-geshet</italic> belong to the same form even though they are vocalized differently.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn291"><sup>94</sup> This word is found in our verse. It comes from the root <italic>yod, dalet, ayin</italic>, and is an infinitive. <italic>Prima facie</italic>, it should have been written <italic>la-da&#x2019;at</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn292"><sup>95</sup> Thus <italic>le-de&#x2019;ah</italic> is a variant of <italic>la-da&#x2019;at</italic>, and what I.E. said about the latter applies to the former as well.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn293"><sup>96</sup> The root of <italic>tenah</italic> is <italic>nun, tav, nun</italic>. The infinitive form is <italic>tet</italic> (or <italic>te-nat</italic>). In <italic>te-nah</italic> a <italic>heh</italic> has been substituted for the <italic>tav</italic>. Hence <italic>le-de&#x2019;ah</italic> and <italic>la-da&#x2019;at</italic> are similar to <italic>tet</italic> (<italic>te-nat</italic>) and <italic>te-nah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn294"><sup>97</sup> <italic>Yad</italic> means a hand. However, here as in Deut. 23:13 it means a place. Thus <italic>yad ha-ye&#x2019;or</italic> means side of the river (place of the river), not hand of the river.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn295"><sup>98</sup> I.E. makes this point because there is an interpretation that <italic>amatah</italic> (her handmaid) means her arm.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn296"><sup>99</sup> Hence they are not one and the same word, even assuming for the moment that <italic>ammah</italic> (cubit) means an arm.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn297"><sup>100</sup> Even if we should connect the word <italic>amatah</italic> with <italic>ammah, ammah</italic> does not mean her arm. It means her cubit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn298"><sup>101</sup> Our verse literally reads: <italic>And she opened it, and saw it, the child. The child</italic> appears redundant, for it is preceded by <italic>and saw it</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn309"><sup>112</sup> <italic>Lekhi</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic> beneath the <italic>lamed</italic>. The usual way of vocalizing this form (the imperative) is with a <italic>sheva</italic>. I.E. points out that this is also the case with the word <italic>shevi</italic>. It is usually vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic>. However, in Jer. 29:5 we find its plural form vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic>. The reason for the change from <italic>sheva</italic> to <italic>tzere</italic> is that these words come at the end of a verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn310"><sup>113</sup> The word <italic>ve-henikehu</italic> (and nurse it) is a combination of <italic>ve-heniki</italic> (and nurse) and <italic>oto</italic> (it). I.E. points out that both <italic>helikhi</italic> and <italic>heniki</italic> are one and the same form, that is, <italic>peh, yod, hifil</italic> imperatives.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn311"><sup>114</sup> The word <italic>helikhi</italic> (take) literally means go. I.E. maintains that there are two roots in Hebrew for the word go, <italic>heh, lamed, kaf</italic>, as in the word <italic>halakhti</italic>, and <italic>yod</italic>, <italic>lamed, kaf</italic>, as in the word <italic>va-yelekh</italic>. I.E. believes that the root of <italic>helikhi</italic> is <italic>yod, lamed, kaf</italic>, the <italic>heh</italic> being the <italic>heh</italic> of the <italic>hifil</italic> conjugation. See note 112.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn312"><sup>115</sup> The <italic>alef, vav</italic>, and <italic>yod</italic> are implied in the vowels <italic>kamatz, cholam</italic>, and <italic>tzere</italic>; i.e., the words vocalized with these vowels are sounded as if followed by an <italic>alef, vav</italic>, or <italic>yod</italic>. Now when a letter is implied in a vowel it is occasionally omitted. If the <italic>heh</italic> was an implied letter then it is possible that the root of <italic>helikhi</italic> is <italic>heh, lamed, kaf</italic> with the <italic>heh</italic> implied. For the <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>helikhi</italic> is not a root letter. It is rather the <italic>heh</italic> of the <italic>hifil</italic> imperative.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn313"><sup>116</sup> That is, the <italic>heh</italic> of the root (the other <italic>heh</italic>) should have appeared in the word <italic>helikhi;</italic> i.e., if <italic>helikhi</italic> came from the root <italic>heh, lamed, kaf</italic> the word should have been spelled <italic>hehlikhi</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn317"><sup>120</sup> That is, it is not a <italic>hifil</italic> imperative from the root <italic>yod, lamed, kaf</italic> but rather a composite of the words <italic>he</italic> and <italic>lekhi</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn320"><sup>123</sup> If the word <italic>helikhi</italic> is a composite then it must be made up of the words <italic>he</italic> (here is) and <italic>lekhi</italic> (to you).

<ftnote id="fn324"><sup>127</sup> Michal had no children (II Sam. 6:23). However, her sister Merab&#x2019;s children are listed in the Bible as her children because she raised them (See I.E.&#x2019;s commentary on Gen. 36:2 and the notes thereto.) Similarly, Scripture considers Moses to be the son of the daughter of Pharaoh since she raised him. It should be noted that there is no verse that reads, &#x201C;and these are the sons of Michal.&#x201D; Scripture reads, <italic>and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul</italic> (II Sam. 21:8). I.E. quoted from memory. Cf. Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn325"><sup>128</sup> I.E. was bothered as to how Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter was able to coin a Hebrew name for the child which commemorated the way in which he came to her. He answers that she either knew Hebrew or asked a Hebrew to coin a name which expressed her feelings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn326"><sup>129</sup> <italic>Mashuy</italic> means drawn. Since Moses was drawn from the water, he should have been called <italic>mashuy</italic>, not <italic>moshe</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn329"><sup>132</sup> Scripture reads, <italic>that he went out</italic>, because Moses went out of the palace (Krinsky). Or I.E. is explaining why Moses considered the Egyptians his brethren. He did so because he was brought up in the king&#x2019;s palace.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn330"><sup>133</sup> Abraham said this to his nephew Lot. We thus see that the term &#x201C;brethren&#x201D; can refer to a member of one&#x2019;s family.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn331"><sup>134</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>a Hebrew, one of his brethren</italic>. If <italic>one of his brethren</italic> means a Hebrew then the Bible is being redundant. I.E. thus explains that <italic>one of his brethren</italic> means a member of his family.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn332"><sup>135</sup> That is, a <italic>nifal</italic> participle. I.E. refers to <italic>nifal</italic> participles as adjectives.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn333"><sup>136</sup> The root of <italic>nitzim</italic> is <italic>nun, tzadi, heh</italic>. In <italic>nitzim</italic> the <italic>nun</italic> of the root is missing because the <italic>nun</italic> in <italic>nitzim</italic> is the <italic>nun</italic> of the <italic>nifal</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn336"><sup>139</sup> To kill me. That is, <italic>sayest thou</italic> (attah omer) means <italic>thinkest thou</italic>. The man was not accusing Moses of actually stating his intention of killing him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn337"><sup>140</sup> Moses was afraid that he would be identified and handed over to Pharaoh. therefore he chose an occupation which kept him away from populated areas.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn338"><sup>141</sup> Moses named his youngest son Eliezer. He derived the name from the Hebrew words <italic>El</italic> (God) and <italic>ezer</italic> (help). Moses so named his son because, he said, <italic>For the God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh</italic> (Ex. 18:4). According to I.E., Moses gave this name to his son after learning that Pharaoh was dead and could no longer harm him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn339"><sup>142</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that Moses did not dwell in the land of Midian prior to being invited by Jethro to dwell with him after having saved his daughters from the shepherds. I.E. notes that here as in other places Scripture describes in a general way what happened and then goes into details.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn340"><sup>143</sup> The well noted in our verse. The text literally reads, <italic>and he sat down by <span class="underline">the</span> well</italic>. J.P.S. renders, <italic>and he sat down by <span class="underline">a</span> well</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn341"><sup>144</sup> That is, that Jacob alighted at Luz on the way to Haran. However, the previous verse reports that Jacob had arrived in Haran. I.E. explains that Scripture first tells us in a general way what happened. It then goes into details. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 28:10 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn342"><sup>145</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on verse 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn343"><sup>146</sup> The Hebrew reads <italic>ve-khihanu li</italic>. If a <italic>kohen</italic> referred only to one who serves the Lord it would not be necessary to add the word <italic>li</italic> (unto me), as it would be understood that the reference is to priests of God. However, since one can also be a priest of idols the Bible adds the word <italic>li</italic>. The same is true with <italic>the priest of the Lord</italic>. If priests only referred to priests of the Lord there would be no reason for the Bible to add <italic>of the Lord</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn344"><sup>147</sup> I.E. never returned to this point. Cf. Weiser. This seems to indicate that he never edited his works.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn345"><sup>148</sup> Since <italic>them</italic> in <italic>and drove them away</italic> refers to females, a <italic>nun</italic> should have been suffixed to <italic>va-yegareshu</italic> (and drove away) and the word read <italic>va-yegareshun</italic> rather than <italic>va-yegareshum</italic>. For the <italic>mem</italic> is a masculine suffix and the <italic>nun</italic> a feminine suffix. I.E. thus notes that although <italic>va-yegareshum</italic> is ordinarily masculine, here it is feminine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn346"><sup>149</sup> At times an extra <italic>nun</italic> (or a superfluous <italic>nun</italic>) is added to the plural imperfect. Thus in place of the usual <italic>yegareshu</italic> (they will drive away) we have <italic>yegareshun</italic> (they will drive away). Now if our word was written <italic>va-yegareshun</italic> we would not know whether the word was merely plural with a superfluous <italic>nun</italic>, meaning: and they drove away, or if it was a plural with a feminine suffix, meaning: and they drove <span class="underline">them</span> away. To avoid this problem Scripture employed the masculine form here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn347"><sup>150</sup> The <italic>nun</italic> is a feminine third person plural pronoun meaning their. Since our text speaks of flocks belonging to females we would expect to find <italic>tzonan</italic>, which has a feminine suffix, and not <italic>tzonam</italic>, which has a masculine suffix. I.E. explains that <italic>tzonam</italic> is used in place of <italic>tzonan</italic> because it is hard to pronounce two <italic>nuns</italic> in succession.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn348"><sup>151</sup> According to our text Zipporah was the daughter of Reuel. However, Scripture always refers to Moses&#x2019; father-in-law by the name of Hobab or Jethro. Hence Zipporah must have been the daughter of Hobab/Jethro and not Reuel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn349"><sup>152</sup> Verse 16 tells us, <italic>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water</italic>. Thus it was the daughters of the priest of Midian and not Moses who drew the water. Moses helped them <italic>and watered the flock</italic> (v. 17); however, he did not draw water for them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn350"><sup>153</sup> And Moses drew additional water for them. Hence they did not embellish upon what Moses had actually done. Scripture either did not report the event or alluded to it in <italic>and (Moses) watered the flock</italic> (v. 17).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn351"><sup>154</sup> Part of a prayer uttered by the patriarch Jacob. However, Jacob&#x2019;s father was Isaac, not Abraham. We thus see that a grandfather is often called and considered as a father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn352"><sup>155</sup> Daniel said this to Belshazzar who, according to I.E., was Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s grandson.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn353"><sup>156</sup> Laban said this of Jacob&#x2019;s children. However, in reality they were Laban&#x2019;s grandchildren.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn354"><sup>157</sup> &#x201C;His&#x201D; refers to Nebuchadnezzar. The Bible thus refers to Nebuchadnezzar as the father of Belshazzar whereas in reality, according to I.E., he was Belshazzar&#x2019;s grandfather.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn355"><sup>158</sup> Reuel told his daughters, <italic>Call him, that he may eat bread</italic>. The next verse opens, <italic>And Moses was content to dwell with the man</italic>. Scripture thus omits that Reuel&#x2019;s daughters called Moses and invited him to eat bread.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn356"><sup>159</sup> The usual form for the feminine plural imperative of the root <italic>kof, resh, heh</italic> is <italic>kirenah</italic>. Thus <italic>kiren</italic> is irregular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn357"><sup>160</sup> Hence Jethro is not mentioned in our incident.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn358"><sup>161</sup> Num. 12:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn359"><sup>162</sup> A legendary history of Moses composed in the Middle Ages. Cf. Y.L. Zunz, <italic>Ha-Derashot Be-Yisrael</italic>, chap. 8. I.E. makes this point here because it is recorded in <italic>The History of Moses</italic> that Moses was a king in the land of Cush and that there he married a Cushite queen. The latter contradicts I.E.&#x2019;s opinion that Zipporah and the Cushite are one and the same person.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 3</title>
<p>1. THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD, UNTO HOREB. This is the manner in which Moses recorded it.<sup><xref rid="fn368">1</xref></sup> The place is called Horeb because of its great heat and lack of rainfall.<sup><xref rid="fn369">2</xref></sup> As Moses noted,<sup><xref rid="fn370">3</xref></sup> it is located three days&#x2019; journey from Egypt. There is no moisture there and the dryness is overpowering because the Nile is far away.</p>
<p>2. APPEARED. Some interpret <italic>be-labbat esh</italic> to mean: in a flame of fire.<sup><xref rid="fn371">4</xref></sup> However, it appears to me that its meaning is, in the heart<sup><xref rid="fn372">5</xref></sup> of the fire, for we indeed find, <italic>How weak is thy heart</italic> (libbatekh) (Ezek. 16:30).<sup><xref rid="fn373">6</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Adonim<sup><xref rid="fn374">7</xref></sup> says that if this were so, then <italic>be-labbat</italic> would have been vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic> beneath the <italic>lamed</italic> like the word <italic>ginnat</italic> (garden of) in <italic>I went down into the garden of nuts</italic> (Canticles 6:11).<sup><xref rid="fn375">8</xref></sup> Now, Rabbi Adonim seems to have forgotten the word <italic>gannah</italic> (garden)<sup><xref rid="fn376">9</xref></sup> in <italic>And as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth</italic> (Is. 61:11).</p>
<p>THE BUSH. Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>seneh</italic> (bush) is a type of thorn bush. He further explains that the word <italic>seneh</italic> in <italic>And the good will of Him that dwelt</italic> (shokhni) <italic>in the bush</italic> (seneh) (Deut. 33:16) means heaven;<sup><xref rid="fn377">10</xref></sup> that is, it refers to God the glorious.<sup><xref rid="fn378">11</xref></sup> Rabbi Joshua,<sup><xref rid="fn379">12</xref></sup> on the other hand, says that the verse refers to the glory that dwelt in the bush.<sup><xref rid="fn380">13</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Joshua spoke incorrectly, for how can God be called &#x201C;Him that dwelleth in the bush&#x201D; when he dwelt there for but a moment.<sup><xref rid="fn381">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, why is the word <italic>shokhni</italic> (dwelt) in the <italic>po&#x2019;el</italic> form?<sup><xref rid="fn382">15</xref></sup> The word <italic>oseh</italic> (makes) in <italic>Who makes</italic> (oseh) <italic>heaven and earth</italic> (Ps. 121:2) is different,<sup><xref rid="fn383">16</xref></sup> as God is constantly making and causing heaven and earth to exist in the same manner as speech issues from the mouth of man.<sup><xref rid="fn384">17</xref></sup> Additionally, after mentioning all the <italic>precious things</italic> (Deut. 33:13-16), Scripture concludes with <italic>the good will of God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn385">18</xref></sup> Moreover, what reason is there to mention this angel?<sup><xref rid="fn386">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture should have read, <italic>ba-seneh</italic> (in the bush)<sup><xref rid="fn387">20</xref></sup> and thereby would have referred to the well-known bush.<sup><xref rid="fn388">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In my opinion <italic>seneh</italic> (bush) refers to only one thing,<sup><xref rid="fn389">22</xref></sup> namely, a type of dry thorn bush. This is the case in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn390">23</xref></sup> Mount Sinai is so named because this type of bush grew there.<sup><xref rid="fn391">24</xref></sup> Similarly, its<sup><xref rid="fn392">25</xref></sup> interpretation is: and the good will that he who lives in the place of the bush (<italic>seneh</italic>) seeks; that is, a person living in such a place entreats and prays that God do his will and wet the land that he lives in. He prays that God change it from a dry place, a place where the <italic>seneh</italic> grows, to an amply watered place so that it becomes like a wet and well-watered garden.</p>
<p>Scripture states that an angel of the Lord appeared <italic>out of the midst of <span class="underline">the</span> bush</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn393">26</xref></sup> The word <italic>seneh</italic> has the definite article the (<italic>heh</italic>) prefixed to it because these are Moses&#x2019; very own words in writing the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn394">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>bo&#x2019;er</italic> (burned) is a transitive verb. The phrase <italic>a burning fire</italic> is similar to <italic>a devouring fire</italic> (Deut. 4:24). <italic>As the fire that burneth</italic> (tivar) <italic>the forest</italic> (Ps. 83:15) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn395">28</xref></sup> Now the fire that burned in the bush devoured all that was around it. Our verse is similar to <italic>They have set Thy sanctuary on fire</italic> (Ps. 74:7).<sup><xref rid="fn396">29</xref></sup> <italic>While the mountain did burn with fire</italic> (Deut. 5:20) is also similar.<sup><xref rid="fn397">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WAS NOT CONSUMED.] The word <italic>ukkal</italic> (consumed) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn398">31</xref></sup> It is similar to the <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn399">32</xref></sup> The words <italic>lukkach</italic> (taken), which is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> in <italic>if thou see me when I am taken</italic> (II Kings 2:10), <italic>yullad</italic> (shall be born) in <italic>unto the child that shall be born</italic> (Jud. 13:8), <italic>yukashim</italic> (snared) in <italic>even so are the sons of man snared</italic> (Eccles. 9:12) are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn400">33</xref></sup> Now since these verbs are transitive, the word <italic>mu&#x2019;edet</italic> (unsteady) in <italic>and an unsteady leg</italic> (Prov. 25:19) cannot be classified among these words<sup><xref rid="fn401">34</xref></sup> as these words are transitive.<sup><xref rid="fn402">35</xref></sup> <italic>Mu&#x2019;edet</italic> is similar to <italic>mo&#x2019;edet</italic>, a <italic>po&#x2019;elet</italic>, with the exception that a <italic>shuruk</italic> has been substituted for a <italic>cholam</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn403">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND MOSES SAID: I WILL TURN ASIDE (<italic>ASURAH</italic>) NOW. When a verb from the root <italic>samekh, vav, resh</italic> is followed by a <italic>mem</italic> it means: to distance from, as in <italic>suru mi-menni</italic> (turn aside from me) (Ps. 6:9) in which the speaker says, distance yourself from me. However, if the word <italic>el</italic> (to) which is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic> follows it, then it has the opposite meaning, as in <italic>suru elai</italic> (turn in) (Jud. 4:18), the meaning of which is, turn from your place and come to me. Moses wanted to turn aside from where he was and to then draw near to the bush.<sup><xref rid="fn404">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SEE THIS GREAT SIGHT. This is the first sign recorded in the Torah that the Lord did via his prophet Moses. Scripture thus says, <italic>and this shall be the token</italic> (sign) <italic>unto thee that I have sent thee</italic> (v. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn405">38</xref></sup> Yefet<sup><xref rid="fn406">39</xref></sup> says that the interpretation of the sign is as follows: the enemy<sup><xref rid="fn407">40</xref></sup> is compared to fire and Israel to a bush. Hence the bush was not burnt.</p>
<p>4. AND WHEN THE LORD SAW. These words were also written later by Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn408">41</xref></sup> The angel was called by God&#x2019;s revered name in the sense of, <italic>for My name is in him</italic> (Ex. 23:21).<sup><xref rid="fn409">42</xref></sup> I will explain this when I comment on the latter verse. We find the same with the angel that appeared to Gideon. There it is written, <italic>And the Lord said unto him</italic> (Jud. 6:23).<sup><xref rid="fn410">43</xref></sup> Or its meaning is that the Lord saw that Moses turned aside to see the great sight and He commanded an angel to call Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn411">44</xref></sup> Hence the use of the term <italic>elohim</italic> (God) in our verse.<sup><xref rid="fn412">45</xref></sup> The name <italic>Elohim</italic> is not a proper name but is, as I will explain, an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn413">46</xref></sup> It pertains to all holy beings that are incorporeal and are not forces in a body, as it is written, <italic>except the angels</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn414">47</xref></sup> <italic>whose dwelling is not with flesh</italic> (Dan. 2:11), that is, with a body.<sup><xref rid="fn415">48</xref></sup> Thus <italic>elohim</italic> refers to the above-noted angel.<sup><xref rid="fn416">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND HE SAID: DRAW NOT NIGH HITHER. Its meaning is, stand in your place and draw not nigh to the bush where the fire is.<sup><xref rid="fn417">50</xref></sup> <italic>Is there yet a man come hither?</italic> (I Sam. 10:22) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn418">51</xref></sup> A <italic>nun</italic> is missing in the word <italic>shal</italic> (put off), as it is in the word <italic>ga</italic> (touch),<sup><xref rid="fn419">52</xref></sup> for the word <italic>shal</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>ve-nashal</italic> (and shall cast out) in <italic>and shall cast out many nations</italic> (Deut. 7:1).</p>
<p>6. MOREOVER HE SAID: I AM THE LORD OF THY FATHER. After stating, <italic>I am the God of thy father</italic>, He explains that the reference is to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He starts with Abraham because Abraham was the first to call upon the name of the Lord and he built an altar to the Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn420">53</xref></sup> for his father and his brother worshipped idols. These three<sup><xref rid="fn421">54</xref></sup> are mentioned while those closest to Moses, namely, Levi, Kehat, and Amram, are not noted<sup><xref rid="fn422">55</xref></sup> because the former were prophets. Furthermore, they were fathers of all of Israel. Levi was not,<sup><xref rid="fn423">56</xref></sup> whereas Moses stood for all of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn424">57</xref></sup> When God told Moses, <italic>I am the God of thy father</italic>, He was, as it were, speaking to all of Israel because Moses represented Israel.</p>
<p>AND MOSES HID HIS FACE. This is similar to <italic>for I have seen God face, to face, and my life is preserved</italic> (Gen. 32:31).<sup><xref rid="fn425">58</xref></sup> The sensory perception of the eye<sup><xref rid="fn426">59</xref></sup> is like the gate of heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn427">60</xref></sup> for it can see in one moment images that are both far and near. However, this is not the case with the senses of the ears, nose, palate, and hand.<sup><xref rid="fn428">61</xref></sup> Moses hid his face because he was greatly afraid.<sup><xref rid="fn429">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND THE LORD SAID. The messenger speaks the same language as the one who sent him.<sup><xref rid="fn430">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>[I HAVE SURELY SEEN.] Its meaning is: I have seen that which people do not see, namely, the violence that is done to them secretly.<sup><xref rid="fn431">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HAVE HEARD THEIR CRY. I have heard their cry which is heard by all and I know the pain which they bear in their hearts.<sup><xref rid="fn432">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND I AM COME DOWN. Scripture says this because the heavens are more glorious than the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn433">66</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s glory fills everything.<sup><xref rid="fn434">67</xref></sup> It is only because the decrees come down from heaven that Scripture employs the term <italic>And I am come down</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn435">68</xref></sup> Furthermore, the angel was a higher form<sup><xref rid="fn436">69</xref></sup> and Moses was not able to go up to heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn437">70</xref></sup> Hence Scripture reads, <italic>and I am come down</italic> to save my people.<sup><xref rid="fn438">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND TO BRING THEM UP. This is in contrast to <italic>and I am come down</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn439">72</xref></sup> As I dwell in a high place<sup><xref rid="fn440">73</xref></sup> so will I cause them to dwell in the most elevated place that is upon the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn441">74</xref></sup> The aforementioned are the words of the angel.<sup><xref rid="fn442">75</xref></sup> It is likewise written, <italic>He made him ride on the high places of the earth</italic> (Deut. 32:13).<sup><xref rid="fn443">76</xref></sup> Behold, the Israelites went out of a land where they were afflicted to a good land.<sup><xref rid="fn444">77</xref></sup> Scripture does not mention the Girgashites<sup><xref rid="fn445">78</xref></sup> because they were the smallest of the seven.<sup><xref rid="fn446">79</xref></sup> Now, it is fitting to raise the following question: Since six nations were descended from Canaan, why does Scripture mention the Canaanites?<sup><xref rid="fn447">80</xref></sup> The answer is: The term Canaanites is an ethnic name and includes all the nations living in Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn448">81</xref></sup> Hence the entire land was called the land of Canaan. The Perizzite is to be identified with Sidon.<sup><xref rid="fn449">82</xref></sup> The rest of the sons of Canaan mentioned in Scripture were few in number and are included in the term Canaanite.</p>
<p>9. AND NOW, BEHOLD. Its meaning is: And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel who have repented<sup><xref rid="fn450">83</xref></sup> is come unto Me.</p>
<p>[MOREOVER I HAVE SEEN THE OPPRESSION.] Its meaning is: Moreover I have seen the oppression with which they in their pride oppress them. Jethro similarly said, <italic>for that they dealt proudly against them</italic> (Ex. 18:11).</p>
<p>10. COME NOW THEREFORE. As My messenger to Pharaoh.<sup><xref rid="fn451">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND MOSES SAID&#x2026;WHO AM I. There is no difference between the words <italic>ani</italic> (I) and <italic>anokhi</italic> (I).<sup><xref rid="fn452">85</xref></sup> The latter are similar to <italic>immi</italic> (with me) and <italic>immadi</italic> (with me). We have found that it is the way of the Hebrew tongue to derive the word <italic>ani</italic> (I) and the words <italic>attah</italic> (you in the singular) and <italic>attem</italic> (you in the plural), whose <italic>nuns</italic> have been swallowed,<sup><xref rid="fn453">86</xref></sup> from the root of <italic>an</italic> (whither) in <italic>Whither went ye</italic> (I Sam. 10:14), as the place indicates the speaker.<sup><xref rid="fn454">87</xref></sup> It is possible that the word <italic>anokhi</italic> is derived from the root of <italic>anakh</italic> (plumbline) (Amos 7:7)<sup><xref rid="fn455">88</xref></sup> in a manner similar to the derivation of the word <italic>nechushtekh</italic> (thy bottom)<sup><xref rid="fn456">89</xref></sup> (Ezek. 16:36).</p>
<p>Because the Lord told Moses, <italic>come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh</italic> (v. 10), Moses responded, I am a shepherd and Pharaoh is a great king.<sup><xref rid="fn457">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because God told Moses, <italic>that thou mayest bring forth My people the children of Israel out of Egypt</italic> (v. 10), Moses answered the Lord, <italic>Who am I</italic> that I am able to bring forth a great nation such as the children of Israel <italic>out of Egypt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn458">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>[12.] AND HE SAID: CERTAINLY I WILL BE WITH THEE. Now go to Pharaoh and bring out the children of Israel and behold, I have given you a token<sup><xref rid="fn459">92</xref></sup> that I have sent you. The reason they are being brought out of Egypt is that they should serve Me on this mountain where I have shown you this great wonder.<sup><xref rid="fn460">93</xref></sup> It is thus written, (<italic>I am the Lord</italic>)<italic>&#x2026;that brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God</italic> (Lev. 22:23). Moses similarly said to Pharaoh, <italic>We will go three days&#x2019; journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God</italic> (Ex. 8:23)<sup><xref rid="fn461">94</xref></sup> because the latter is the walking distance between eastern Egypt and Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn462">95</xref></sup> However, when Israel left Egypt they did not go there via the land of the Philistines.<sup><xref rid="fn463">96</xref></sup> Furthermore, Israel, as I will explain, dwelt in one place for many days.<sup><xref rid="fn464">97</xref></sup> It is precisely this<sup><xref rid="fn465">98</xref></sup> that Moses spoke of when he wrote, <italic>and (Moses) builded an altar under the mount&#x2026;and&#x2026;offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings</italic> (Ex. 24:4, 5). He then made a covenant with Israel that they be a people unto the Lord and that the Lord be their God.<sup><xref rid="fn466">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND MOSES SAID. Moses now asked which of God&#x2019;s names he should relate to Israel, for with the name of <italic>El Shaddai</italic> (God Almighty) he could not perform signs.<sup><xref rid="fn467">100</xref></sup> The latter are only performed with God&#x2019;s great and glorious name.<sup><xref rid="fn468">101</xref></sup> Rabbi Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn469">102</xref></sup> says that the Israelites had a tradition from their forefathers that Israel&#x2019;s savior would reveal a new name of God to them, a name that they had never heard.<sup><xref rid="fn470">103</xref></sup> Now when Rabbi Joshua heard that Scripture states, <italic>I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees</italic> (Gen. 15:7),<sup><xref rid="fn471">104</xref></sup> he explained it by saying that these are the words of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn472">105</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Joshua is mistaken. In the Torah portion <italic>Bereshit</italic> at the beginning of the Pentateuch we find that Scripture does not employ the Tetragrammaton but uses the name <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) until the verse which concludes with the words <italic>in creating had made</italic> (Gen. 2:3).<sup><xref rid="fn473">106</xref></sup> After the latter verse Scripture refers to God by the name <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic> (Lord God). After the birth of Cain, Scripture employs the term <italic>Adonai</italic> (Lord) for the Deity only by itself.<sup><xref rid="fn474">107</xref></sup> We never find Moses using the name <italic>Elohim</italic> for God. Moses always refers to Him by His great and glorious name.<sup><xref rid="fn475">108</xref></sup> He uses the term <italic>Elohim</italic> only in one place. He does this because Pharaoh said, <italic>Entreat the Lord, and let there be enough of God&#x2019;s</italic> (Elohim)<sup><xref rid="fn476">109</xref></sup> <italic>thunderings</italic> (Ex. 9:28). Upon hearing this, Moses responded, <italic>I know that ye will not fear the Lord</italic> (Adonai Elohim) (Ex. 9:30).<sup><xref rid="fn477">110</xref></sup> However, there is no other similar case in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn478">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND GOD SAID&#x2026;I AM. Its meaning is, That I Am.<sup><xref rid="fn479">112</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And the house of David shall be as God, As the angel of the Lord before them</italic> (Zech. 12:8). <italic>Angel of the Lord</italic>, which follows <italic>God</italic>, explains the term <italic>God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn480">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND GOD SAID MOREOVER&#x2026;THE LORD. Another name meaning the same as the first one.<sup><xref rid="fn481">114</xref></sup> However, one name (<italic>EHYH</italic>) is in the first person and this name (<italic>YHVH</italic>) is in the third person.<sup><xref rid="fn482">115</xref></sup> It comes from the same root as <italic>yah</italic> (Lord). These three names are proper names.<sup><xref rid="fn483">116</xref></sup> I will now go on to explain the meaning of the proper name of God, the meaning of its letters, part of the secret of God&#x2019;s glorious name, and why it is not read as written.<sup><xref rid="fn484">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>The words of Abraham the author: Behold, I now begin to elaborate because I need a firm foundation. Note that a proper name serves as a token and as a sign of the one being referred to by those who enunciate it and those who hear it.<sup><xref rid="fn485">118</xref></sup> A proper name is distinguished from an adjective<sup><xref rid="fn486">119</xref></sup> in four ways. The first is that an adjective is derived from an imperative, such as <italic>chakham</italic> (be wise)<sup><xref rid="fn487">120</xref></sup> in <italic>My son, be wise</italic> (Prov. 27:11), or a perfect, as in <italic>My son, if your heart gets wisdom</italic> (chakham)<sup><xref rid="fn488">121</xref></sup> (Prov. 23:15), or an imperfect, as in <italic>That thou mayest be wise</italic> (techkam) <italic>in thy latter end</italic> (Prov. 19:20).<sup><xref rid="fn489">122</xref></sup> However, this is not the case with a proper noun such as Abraham, as no perfect or imperfect form can be derived from it.<sup><xref rid="fn490">123</xref></sup> Now even though there are proper nouns that are derived from verbs, such as the name <italic>yitzchak</italic> (Isaac),<sup><xref rid="fn491">124</xref></sup> we do not say <italic>yitzchakti</italic> (I was Isaaced) or <italic>itzchak</italic> (I will be Isaaced).<sup><xref rid="fn492">125</xref></sup> A proper name is not used as an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn493">126</xref></sup> The second difference is that an adjective comes in the plural. For example, <italic>chakham</italic> (wise) becomes <italic>chakhamim</italic> (wise). However, we do not have a plural form for the proper name <italic>avraham</italic> (Abraham). Thus we do not say <italic>avrahamim</italic> (Abrahams). Neither is there a plural for the proper name <italic>yisra&#x2019;el</italic> (Israel). Thus if there are two people named Israel in a place we do not say <italic>yisra&#x2019;elim</italic> (Israels). We would only use the term <italic>yisra&#x2019;elim</italic> if we wanted to relate each of them to the people of Israel, as the term Israel is the name of a group.<sup><xref rid="fn494">127</xref></sup> The third difference is that a definite article is not prefixed to a proper noun as it is to an adjective. From the word <italic>chakham</italic> (wise) we get <italic>he-chakham</italic> (the wise man) (Eccles. 2:14).<sup><xref rid="fn495">128</xref></sup> However, it is incorrect to say <italic>ha-avraham</italic> (the Abraham) or <italic>ha-yitzchak</italic> (the Isaac). The word <italic>ha-kohelet</italic> (Eccles. 12:8)<sup><xref rid="fn496">129</xref></sup> cannot be used as an argument against the aforementioned because the term <italic>kohelet</italic> is not a proper name but an adjective describing the wisdom which was accumulated.<sup><xref rid="fn497">130</xref></sup> Similarly, the word <italic>va-ha-adam</italic> (Gen. 2:8)<sup><xref rid="fn498">131</xref></sup> is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn499">132</xref></sup> It has a secret meaning to it, as it is the name of a genus.<sup><xref rid="fn500">133</xref></sup> The name <italic>ha-menasheh</italic> (Deut. 3:13)<sup><xref rid="fn501">134</xref></sup> has a definite article before it because it refers to genealogy.<sup><xref rid="fn502">135</xref></sup> The fourth difference is that a proper noun has no construct form whereas an adjective does. For example, we find, <italic>chakham lev</italic> (wise of heart) (Job 9:4). However, it would be incorrect to say <italic>yitzchak ha-dor</italic> (Isaac of the generation), because a proper name stands by itself.<sup><xref rid="fn503">136</xref></sup> The same is the case with the name <italic>Eheyeh</italic> (I am) and also with the glorious name of God, the Tetragrammaton, because both of these names are proper names.<sup><xref rid="fn504">137</xref></sup> Now, we do find, <italic>Adonai tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> (the Lord of hosts) (Is. 1:9),<sup><xref rid="fn505">138</xref></sup> and as a result many were forced to conclude that <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> is a proper name<sup><xref rid="fn506">139</xref></sup> or that the Lord is outstanding among<sup><xref rid="fn507">140</xref></sup> His host.<sup><xref rid="fn508">141</xref></sup> However, this is incorrect, because Scripture reads, <italic>Elohe ha-tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> (the God of Hosts) (Amos 3:13).<sup><xref rid="fn509">142</xref></sup> <italic>Tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> is never encountered by itself. It is always connected either to the word <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) or to God&#x2019;s glorious name, <italic>Adonai</italic> (<italic>Elohim</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn510">143</xref></sup> Do not be bothered by the phrase <italic>Adonai Elohim tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> (O Lord God of hosts) (Ps. 59:6),<sup><xref rid="fn511">144</xref></sup> as its meaning is similar to <italic>ve-ha-nevu&#x2019;ah oded ha-navi</italic> (even the prophecy of Oded the prophet) (II Chron. 15:8).<sup><xref rid="fn512">145</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the Lord&#x2019;s personal name is sometimes used in an adjectival sense because God alone exists forever and the existence of all things is contingent upon Him.<sup><xref rid="fn513">146</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s proper name is used here in the same way that the name <italic>moshe</italic> (Moses) is used in <italic>Then He remembered the days of old, when He drew</italic> (moshe) <italic>His people</italic> (Is. 63:11).<sup><xref rid="fn514">147</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>Adonai</italic> when used as an adjective is: the maintainer of existence. Hence in the phrase <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic> the holy angels are connected to God.<sup><xref rid="fn515">148</xref></sup> Similarly, in the phrase <italic>Adonai tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> (Lord of hosts) <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> refers to the hosts of heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn516">149</xref></sup> Pay no attention to Saadiah Gaon who says that God is called <italic>Adonai tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> because of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn517">150</xref></sup> Saadiah offers proof<sup><xref rid="fn518">151</xref></sup> from <italic>and I will&#x2026;bring forth My hosts</italic> (tzivotai), <italic>My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt</italic> (Ex. 7:4). However, look at <italic>I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him</italic> (I Kings 22:19).<sup><xref rid="fn519">152</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the name <italic>Elohim</italic> is an adjective, because it comes in both the plural and the singular.<sup><xref rid="fn520">153</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Is not God</italic> (Elo&#x2019;a) <italic>in the height of heaven</italic> (Job 22:12).<sup><xref rid="fn521">154</xref></sup> Furthermore, the word <italic>Elohim</italic> comes in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn522">155</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Elohim Elohe yisra&#x2019;el</italic> (God, the God of Israel) (Ps. 72:12).<sup><xref rid="fn523">156</xref></sup> The word <italic>El</italic> (God) means mighty. The same is true of the term <italic>Shaddai</italic> (Almighty).<sup><xref rid="fn524">157</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Like the noise of great waters, like a mighty voice</italic> (Ezek. 1:24); and, <italic>and thy treasure shall be mighty</italic> (shaddai) (Job 22:25).<sup><xref rid="fn525">158</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that the number one is the secret and the foundation of all numbers,<sup><xref rid="fn526">159</xref></sup> and that two is the first of the even numbers and three the first of the odd numbers. Now from one point of view there are only nine numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn527">160</xref></sup> However, from another perspective there are ten numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn528">161</xref></sup> If the numbers one to nine are written in a circle<sup><xref rid="fn529">162</xref></sup> and the last number<sup><xref rid="fn530">163</xref></sup> is multiplied by each of the other numbers,<sup><xref rid="fn531">164</xref></sup> we find that the ones<sup><xref rid="fn532">165</xref></sup> are on the left and the tens, which look like ones, are on the right.<sup><xref rid="fn533">166</xref></sup> Now when we come to the number five which is in the middle, we find the reverse; i.e., the tens become ones and the ones become tens.<sup><xref rid="fn534">167</xref></sup> However, looked upon from another perspective, there are ten numbers<sup><xref rid="fn535">168</xref></sup> without any additions,<sup><xref rid="fn536">169</xref></sup> for one cannot begin to count one without ten.<sup><xref rid="fn537">170</xref></sup> The number ten is thus like the number one.<sup><xref rid="fn538">171</xref></sup> It is a general term for all the ones, i.e., the numbers from one through ten.<sup><xref rid="fn539">172</xref></sup> The number ten includes them because they are the first numbers. It is also similar to the ones because it is the first of the numbers,<sup><xref rid="fn540">173</xref></sup> in the same way that the ones are, because when we reach the number twenty we have two tens paralleling the number two. Similarly, thirty is like three and all the tens till ninety are like the nine ones. When the number one hundred is reached we once again come upon a number which is similar to one. When we reach nine hundred we once again have nine numbers similar to the nine ones.<sup><xref rid="fn541">174</xref></sup> This is so until we reach the number one thousand which consists of ten hundreds. Also, the number one thousand is similar to the number one, and likewise the following numbers correspond to the other nine numbers until nine thousand.<sup><xref rid="fn542">175</xref></sup> When we reach ten thousand the sum is concluded because we now have one myriad. The same applies<sup><xref rid="fn543">176</xref></sup> until we reach ten myriads. The beginning of all the numbers<sup><xref rid="fn544">177</xref></sup> is similar to the number one. Hence mathematicians say that all of the numbers<sup><xref rid="fn545">178</xref></sup> are either fractions of ten<sup><xref rid="fn546">179</xref></sup> or multiples of ten,<sup><xref rid="fn547">180</xref></sup> or the result of adding ten to the ones,<sup><xref rid="fn548">181</xref></sup> or a combination of these two.<sup><xref rid="fn549">182</xref></sup> Now the ten numbers are the same as the fingers on the hand,<sup><xref rid="fn550">183</xref></sup> five corresponding to five.<sup><xref rid="fn551">184</xref></sup> Similarly, there are nine spheres which are in a constant glorious state.<sup><xref rid="fn552">185</xref></sup> The tenth sphere, which is holy, is so called<sup><xref rid="fn553">186</xref></sup> because its power is manifest throughout the throne of glory.<sup><xref rid="fn554">187</xref></sup> It is the most powerful sphere and circles all the bodies.<sup><xref rid="fn555">188</xref></sup> There are two middle digits when we count from one to ten, namely, the numbers five and six.<sup><xref rid="fn556">189</xref></sup> Now the numbers <italic>alef</italic> (1), <italic>heh</italic> (5), <italic>vav</italic> (6), and <italic>yod</italic> (10) are the most glorious numerals.<sup><xref rid="fn557">190</xref></sup> Any squared number that ends in one will always have the number one in its root.<sup><xref rid="fn558">191</xref></sup> The same is true with its counterpart.<sup><xref rid="fn559">192</xref></sup> Similarly, the number five will be found in the square of five<sup><xref rid="fn560">193</xref></sup> and the number six will be found in the square of six.<sup><xref rid="fn561">194</xref></sup> These four numbers always maintain their identity when squared;<sup><xref rid="fn562">195</xref></sup> therein lies their superiority over all other numbers that are squared. Additionally, every number is potentially present in the number one.<sup><xref rid="fn563">196</xref></sup> Similarly, the number one is found in all the actual numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn564">197</xref></sup> Furthermore, the number one accomplishes on one side what the other numbers accomplish in two sides.<sup><xref rid="fn565">198</xref></sup> Now behold the power of the number one. If you add its square to the square of its double you get five,<sup><xref rid="fn566">199</xref></sup> a number whose cube equals its squares, for if you add its square<sup><xref rid="fn567">200</xref></sup> to the square of its double<sup><xref rid="fn568">201</xref></sup> it will equal its cube.<sup><xref rid="fn569">202</xref></sup> In all the numbers preceding five<sup><xref rid="fn570">203</xref></sup> the relationship of the cube to the sum of the two squared numbers will be the same as the relationship of that number to five.<sup><xref rid="fn571">204</xref></sup> The reverse is the case with the numbers above five.<sup><xref rid="fn572">205</xref></sup> The number six<sup><xref rid="fn573">206</xref></sup> is equal to its parts.<sup><xref rid="fn574">207</xref></sup> There is no other number in the order of the integers that equals its parts aside from this number. When<sup><xref rid="fn575">208</xref></sup> the square of one is added to the square of the first of the odd numbers<sup><xref rid="fn576">209</xref></sup> we get ten.<sup><xref rid="fn577">210</xref></sup> Now if we bisect a circle with a line that is ten units long<sup><xref rid="fn578">211</xref></sup> and a line is drawn across the circle a third of the way up, a triangle two of whose sides are equal may be drawn.<sup><xref rid="fn579">212</xref></sup> The number representing the area of this triangle will equal the circumference of the circle.<sup><xref rid="fn580">213</xref></sup> Similarly the rectangle<sup><xref rid="fn581">214</xref></sup> formed in the circle.<sup><xref rid="fn582">215</xref></sup> Now up to ten<sup><xref rid="fn583">216</xref></sup> the value of the triangle<sup><xref rid="fn584">217</xref></sup> to the circumference will be the same as the diameter is to ten.<sup><xref rid="fn585">218</xref></sup> The reverse will be the case in the numbers above ten.<sup><xref rid="fn586">219</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now these four letters<sup><xref rid="fn587">220</xref></sup> are very precious. They add up to twenty-two,<sup><xref rid="fn588">221</xref></sup> the number of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet. Do not count the doubled letters twice,<sup><xref rid="fn589">222</xref></sup> as they are the original letters with their horizontal bases straightened to form a line.<sup><xref rid="fn590">223</xref></sup> The reason they have one name even though they are written differently is that they have one sound.<sup><xref rid="fn591">224</xref></sup> The master of Hebrew grammar<sup><xref rid="fn592">225</xref></sup> perceived that the letters have five sources.<sup><xref rid="fn593">226</xref></sup> He classified half of the letters as root letters<sup><xref rid="fn594">227</xref></sup> only, and half as root, prefix, or suffix letters.<sup><xref rid="fn595">228</xref></sup> Now the second group of letters<sup><xref rid="fn596">229</xref></sup> is more important than the first group.<sup><xref rid="fn597">230</xref></sup> It is proper that a letter that is said often be one that is easy to pronounce.<sup><xref rid="fn598">231</xref></sup> It is also fitting that the <italic>alef, heh, vav</italic>, and <italic>yod</italic> be easy to pronounce and have important meanings.<sup><xref rid="fn599">232</xref></sup> These four letters are found in the vowels<sup><xref rid="fn600">233</xref></sup> and are implied letters.<sup><xref rid="fn601">234</xref></sup> These letters serve at times as consonants, at times as silent letters,<sup><xref rid="fn602">235</xref></sup> and at times as paragogic letters.<sup><xref rid="fn603">236</xref></sup> At times they drop out.<sup><xref rid="fn604">237</xref></sup> At other times they are swallowed by a <italic>dagesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn605">238</xref></sup> Finally, at other times they interchange with each other.<sup><xref rid="fn606">239</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now there are four gutturals. They start with the <italic>ayin</italic>, which is followed by the <italic>chet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn607">240</xref></sup> Do not consider all the letters that make up the name of a guttural in your definition of a guttural, as the additional letters are not made by the throat.<sup><xref rid="fn608">241</xref></sup> It is best to refer to them as sounded with a <italic>pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn609">242</xref></sup> Now the <italic>ayin</italic> and <italic>chet</italic> are very hard to sound. A person who is not accustomed to pronouncing them in his youth will not be able to sound them properly. Thus the gentiles cannot sound them.<sup><xref rid="fn610">243</xref></sup> Hence only the <italic>alef</italic> and <italic>heh</italic> were chosen from among the gutturals to serve as ministering letters.<sup><xref rid="fn611">244</xref></sup> Ministering letters were also chosen from among the palatals, i.e., <italic>gimel, yod, kaf, kof</italic>, as the palate is next to the throat. The <italic>yod</italic> and <italic>kaf</italic> were chosen from the palatals to serve as ministering letters because they are the easiest palatals to pronounce. The <italic>gimel</italic> and <italic>kof</italic> are therefore only used as root letters.</p>
<p>The letters <italic>dalet, tet, lamed, nun</italic>, and <italic>tav</italic> are linguals. Two letters, the <italic>dalet</italic> and the <italic>tet</italic>, were chosen from the linguals to serve only as root letters. The others serve both as root letters and as ministering letters. The letters <italic>zayin, samekh, shin, resh</italic>, and <italic>tzadi</italic> are dentals. They are all hard to pronounce.<sup><xref rid="fn612">245</xref></sup> The <italic>shin</italic> is the easiest of the dentals to sound. Hence it was chosen as a ministering letter while the others were left to serve only as root letters. Therefore three letters were chosen from among the labials, namely, the <italic>bet, vav, mem</italic>, and <italic>peh</italic>, to serve as ministering letters.<sup><xref rid="fn613">246</xref></sup> The <italic>peh</italic> was left to serve only as a root letter.</p>
<p>It is only right that the alphabet begin with a guttural, because the throat is the first organ in the framework of the human body to produce a sound.<sup><xref rid="fn614">247</xref></sup> It does so from bottom to top.<sup><xref rid="fn615">248</xref></sup> The <italic>alef</italic> comes before the <italic>heh</italic> because it is the easiest guttural to pronounce. Hence the <italic>alef</italic> heads all the other letters of the alphabet and is equivalent to the number one. It is fitting that the <italic>heh</italic> be the fifth number equivalent to the glorious number five.<sup><xref rid="fn616">249</xref></sup> These two letters are the easiest to enunciate. Now since the first letter of the alphabet is a guttural the second letter in the alphabet was chosen from among the five labials, which are produced by the last of the body&#x2019;s five organs of speech.<sup><xref rid="fn617">250</xref></sup> Hence the <italic>bet</italic> follows the <italic>alef</italic>, the <italic>vav</italic> also follows the <italic>heh</italic>, and the <italic>peh</italic> the <italic>ayin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn618">251</xref></sup> Now it was necessary to put in two letters between the <italic>bet</italic> and the <italic>heh</italic>. A palatal, the <italic>gimel</italic>, was chosen as the third letter and a lingual, the <italic>dalet</italic>, as the fourth letter.<sup><xref rid="fn619">252</xref></sup> Hence a dental, namely, the <italic>zayin</italic>, follows the <italic>vav</italic>. The Hebrew grammarian now had to use the fourth of the implied letters<sup><xref rid="fn620">253</xref></sup> for the tenth letter, which is equivalent to the number ten. He had already used the gutturals <italic>alef</italic> and <italic>heh</italic> whose great importance has previously been explained as the first and the fifth letters. He had similarly used the <italic>vav</italic>, which happens to be a very important and easily sounded labial. Now there are no root letters more easily pronounceable than the palatals. He chose from the palatals the <italic>yod</italic> and the <italic>kaf</italic> to serve as ministering letters. The more easily pronounceable of the two is the <italic>yod</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn621">254</xref></sup></p>
<p>Four letters are fit to be implied letters.<sup><xref rid="fn622">255</xref></sup> The <italic>alef</italic> is silent in all vowels<sup><xref rid="fn623">256</xref></sup> because it is equivalent to the number one. We find the <italic>alef</italic> with the <italic>cholam</italic> in the word <italic>rosh</italic> (head);<sup><xref rid="fn624">257</xref></sup> with the <italic>kamatz</italic> in <italic>roshim</italic> (heads);<sup><xref rid="fn625">258</xref></sup> with the <italic>chirik</italic> in the word <italic>rishon</italic> (first); with the <italic>tzere</italic> in <italic>reshit</italic> (beginning of);<sup><xref rid="fn626">259</xref></sup> with the <italic>shuruk</italic> in <italic>pura</italic> (boughs)<sup><xref rid="fn627">260</xref></sup> in <italic>Shall lop the boughs</italic> (Is. 10:33); with the <italic>pattach</italic> in <italic>chattat</italic> (purification)<sup><xref rid="fn628">261</xref></sup> in <italic>For purification and for sprinkling</italic> (Zech. 13:1); and with the <italic>segol</italic> in <italic>pele</italic> (wonders)<sup><xref rid="fn629">262</xref></sup> in <italic>doing wonders</italic> (Ex. 16:11). It serves as a first person imperfect prefix in the masculine and in the feminine because it is the first letter of the alphabet. Since the <italic>alef</italic> is never sounded when it comes at the end of a word, it does not serve as the sign of the feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn630">263</xref></sup> However, it occasionally takes the place of the <italic>heh</italic>, as in <italic>marah</italic> (bitter)<sup><xref rid="fn631">264</xref></sup> in <italic>call me Marah</italic> (Ruth 1:20) and in <italic>gaveha</italic> (was exalted)<sup><xref rid="fn632">265</xref></sup> in <italic>its stature was exalted</italic> (Ezek. 31:5). The <italic>alef</italic> is also found employed as a superfluous letter at the end of a word, as in <italic>ve-attikeiha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn633">266</xref></sup> (and the galleries thereof) (Ezek. 41:15) and <italic>he-halekhu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn634">267</xref></sup> (that went) in <italic>that went with him</italic> (Joshua 10:24). It is also found as a sounded superfluous letter at the beginning of a word, as in <italic>etmol</italic><sup><xref rid="fn635">268</xref></sup> (yesterday) (II Sam. 5:2) and <italic>ve-ezro&#x2019;i</italic><sup><xref rid="fn636">269</xref></sup> (and my arm) (Job 31:22). It is similarly used in the middle of a word, as in <italic>ve-he&#x2019;eznihu</italic> (shall become foul) in <italic>And the rivers shall become foul</italic> (Is. 19:6). The <italic>alef</italic> is also found unsounded at the end of a word, as in the word <italic>chet</italic> (sin)<sup><xref rid="fn637">270</xref></sup> (Deut. 23:22). At times the silent <italic>alef</italic> is dropped, as in the word <italic>kes</italic> (throne)<sup><xref rid="fn638">271</xref></sup> in <italic>the throne of the Lord</italic> (Ex. 17:14). At times it interchanges with a <italic>heh</italic> or a <italic>yod</italic>, as in <italic>ha-amon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn639">272</xref></sup> (the multitude) (Jer. 52:15), which is a variation of <italic>he-hamon</italic> (II Sam. 18:29); or <italic>tityammeru</italic><sup><xref rid="fn640">273</xref></sup> (shall ye revel) (Is. 61:6), which is a variation of <italic>yitammeru</italic> (Ps. 94:4). It is also found sounded with a <italic>vav</italic>, as in <italic>tomeru</italic> (say ye)<sup><xref rid="fn641">274</xref></sup> in <italic>And say ye to Amasa</italic> (II Sam. 19:14).</p>
<p>Now these three letters<sup><xref rid="fn642">275</xref></sup> are fit to serve as prefixes and suffixes. The letter <italic>yod</italic>, which is similar to the number one (the <italic>alef</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn643">276</xref></sup> serves as a first person suffix both in the masculine and in the feminine. In the verbal forms we find <italic>shamarti</italic> (I have kept) (Ps. 17:4) and <italic>amarti</italic> (I have said) (Ex. 23:13); among the nouns we find <italic>shemi</italic> (my name) (Ex. 23:21). The <italic>yod</italic> is also employed as a third person masculine imperfect prefix, as the number ten is like the number one.<sup><xref rid="fn644">277</xref></sup> In the feminine it is oppositely positioned and serves as a suffix,<sup><xref rid="fn645">278</xref></sup> as in <italic>de&#x2019;i</italic> (know), <italic>re&#x2019;i</italic> (see) (I Sam. 28:17), and <italic>tizkeri</italic> (thou mayest remember) in <italic>that thou mayest remember</italic> (Ezek. 16:63). This <italic>yod</italic> also shows relationship<sup><xref rid="fn646">279</xref></sup> because as a numeral it is similar to the number one.<sup><xref rid="fn647">280</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic> is a sign of the plural construct connected to the third person, as in <italic>yede</italic> (hands of) in <italic>The hands of women full of compassion</italic> (Lam. 4:10) and <italic>yadai</italic> (my hands) in <italic>even My hands have stretched out the heavens</italic> (Is. 45:12) because the number ten<sup><xref rid="fn648">281</xref></sup> includes all numbers in it.<sup><xref rid="fn649">282</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic> is encountered as a silent letter when it follows a <italic>chirik</italic>, as in <italic>ragli</italic> (my foot) (Ps. 26:10); a <italic>tzere</italic>, as in <italic>ragle</italic> (the feet of) in <italic>He will keep the feet of his holy ones</italic> (I Sam. 2:9); or a <italic>kamatz</italic>, as in <italic>yadav</italic> (his hands) and <italic>raglav</italic> (his feet). The <italic>yod</italic> is found in place of a <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn650">283</xref></sup> (it is also found in place of a <italic>vav</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn651">284</xref></sup> as in <italic>hoyah</italic> (is) (Ex. 9:3), which is a variation of the word <italic>hovah</italic> (wouldest be) in <italic>and thou wouldest be their king</italic> (Nehemiah 6:6).<sup><xref rid="fn652">285</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic> takes the place of a <italic>heh</italic> in the word <italic>yechesayun</italic> (take refuge) (Ps. 36:8), which comes from the root <italic>chet, samekh, heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn653">286</xref></sup> It takes the place of an <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>yisharti</italic> (to be right)<sup><xref rid="fn654">287</xref></sup> in <italic>all precepts&#x2026;all things to be right</italic> (Ps. 119:128). The <italic>yod</italic> is found as a superfluous letter in the words <italic>yitzhar</italic> (oil)<sup><xref rid="fn655">288</xref></sup> (Num. 18:12), <italic>ha-yoshevi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn656">289</xref></sup> (that art enthroned) (Ps. 123:1), and <italic>rabbati</italic><sup><xref rid="fn657">290</xref></sup> (great) (Lam. 1:1). The <italic>heh</italic> is also used to indicate the presence of a thing,<sup><xref rid="fn658">291</xref></sup> for this is its meaning in <italic>he lakehem zera</italic> (Lo, here is seed for you) (Gen. 47:23). The <italic>heh</italic> is also sometimes used to introduce a question,<sup><xref rid="fn659">292</xref></sup> as in <italic>ha-bemachanim</italic> (whether in camps) (Num. 13:19), and <italic>ha-niheyeh</italic> (whether there hath been) (Deut. 4:32); or as the sign of the definite article,<sup><xref rid="fn660">293</xref></sup> as in <italic>ha-eved ha-ivri</italic> (the Hebrew servant) (Gen. 39:17) and <italic>ha-anashim</italic> (the men) (Gen. 19:5). The <italic>heh</italic> suffixed to a verb indicates a third person feminine perfect. It is similarly used with nouns.<sup><xref rid="fn661">294</xref></sup> The masculine form, on the other hand, was left without a sign.<sup><xref rid="fn662">295</xref></sup> Compare the word <italic>amar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn663">296</xref></sup> and the word <italic>amerah</italic> in <italic>saith Koheleth</italic> (Eccles. 7:27).<sup><xref rid="fn664">297</xref></sup> The <italic>heh</italic> is also used as a sign of the feminine when the imperfect is combined with the pronoun, as in <italic>eshmerenah</italic> (I will watch her), <italic>yishmerennah</italic> (he will watch her),<sup><xref rid="fn665">298</xref></sup> <italic>nishmerennah</italic> (we will watch her), <italic>tishmerennah</italic> (you will watch her), <italic>yishmeruha</italic> (they will watch her), <italic>shemarnuha</italic> (we watched her), and <italic>shimruha</italic> (watch her). The <italic>heh</italic> serves as the sign of the feminine noun, compare, <italic>na&#x2019;arah be-tulah</italic> (a damsel that is a virgin) (Deut. 22:28). The <italic>heh</italic> is appended to the <italic>hifil</italic><sup><xref rid="fn666">299</xref></sup> and also to the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic><sup><xref rid="fn667">300</xref></sup> conjugations. The <italic>heh</italic> is also at times dropped, as in the word <italic>mazzeh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn668">301</xref></sup> (what is that) in <italic>What is that in thy hand</italic> (Ex. 4:2). It is similar to the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>etzarekha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn669">302</xref></sup> (I formed thee) in <italic>Before I formed thee</italic> (Jer. 1:4), and it is like the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>va-abbedkha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn670">303</xref></sup> (and I have destroyed thee) in <italic>and I have destroyed thee, O covering cherub</italic> (Ezek. 28:16). It is also superfluously appended to the end of a verb, as in <italic>eshme&#x2019;ah</italic> (I will hear),<sup><xref rid="fn671">304</xref></sup> or a noun as in <italic>laylah</italic> (night).<sup><xref rid="fn672">305</xref></sup> It is silent when following the <italic>kamatz, tzere, segol, cholam</italic>, or <italic>shuruk</italic>. Compare the words <italic>asah</italic> (made)<sup><xref rid="fn673">306</xref></sup> and <italic>boneh</italic> (doth build)<sup><xref rid="fn674">307</xref></sup> in <italic>the Lord doth build up Jerusalem</italic> (Ps. 147:2); <italic>boneh</italic> (build)<sup><xref rid="fn675">308</xref></sup> in <italic>And the house which I build</italic> (II Chron. 2:4); <italic>pera&#x2019;oh</italic> (let them loose)<sup><xref rid="fn676">309</xref></sup> in <italic>for Aaron had let them loose</italic> (Ex. 32:25), also <italic>shelomoh</italic> (Solomon)<sup><xref rid="fn677">310</xref></sup> and <italic>yikrechu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn678">311</xref></sup> (they shall not make baldness) (Lev. 21:5).</p>
<p>The <italic>vav</italic> is used as a connective and is in such instances placed in front of the word because the <italic>vav</italic> sound is made by connecting the lips. The <italic>vav</italic> is used as a connective in the phrases <italic>avraham ve-yitzchak</italic> (Abraham and Isaac) (Gen. 48:16) and in <italic>mi fa&#x2019;al ve-asah</italic> (who hath wrought and done it) (Is. 41:4). The <italic>vav</italic> is also employed as a masculine and feminine plural perfect suffix. It is also used as a masculine imperfect suffix. It is similarly employed at times as a feminine imperfect suffix, as in <italic>im timtze&#x2019;u</italic> (if ye find) (Cant. 5:8) and <italic>im ta&#x2019;iru</italic> (that ye awaken not (Cant., 7:2).<sup><xref rid="fn679">312</xref></sup> The <italic>vav</italic> is found as a silent letter when employed with the <italic>shuruk</italic> and <italic>cholam</italic> vowels. It is used as a masculine pronominal suffix with words in the perfect, as in <italic>shemaro</italic> (he watched him); with a noun, as in <italic>yado</italic> (his hand), and with a verb in the imperfect, as in <italic>yirdefo</italic> (will pursue him). It is vocalized with a <italic>shuruk</italic> following a <italic>heh</italic>, or a <italic>nun</italic> with a <italic>dagesh</italic>, as in <italic>yishmerehu</italic> (preserve him) (Ps. 41:3) or <italic>yishmerennu be&#x2019;alav</italic> (its owner hath&#x2026;kept it in) (Ex. 21:36), because the <italic>heh</italic> is used as a feminine suffix.<sup><xref rid="fn680">313</xref></sup> The <italic>vav</italic> is also used as a sign of the plural in verbs in the perfect and imperfect.<sup><xref rid="fn681">314</xref></sup></p>
<p>I have shown that these four letters<sup><xref rid="fn682">315</xref></sup> are implied letters. Therefore the proper names<sup><xref rid="fn683">316</xref></sup> that are constructed from these four glorious letters are glorious names. Now the first of these divine names<sup><xref rid="fn684">317</xref></sup> is only found here. It is not encountered elsewhere in Scripture. We know that when Moses spoke to Pharaoh he enunciated God&#x2019;s name as written. He did not employ any substitute.<sup><xref rid="fn685">318</xref></sup> Moses acted thus because he was holy. However,<sup><xref rid="fn686">319</xref></sup> the ancients<sup><xref rid="fn687">320</xref></sup> were forced to use a substitute name when referring to God.<sup><xref rid="fn688">321</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>and this is My memorial</italic> is the same as <italic>this is My name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn689">322</xref></sup> as our text employs two words with one meaning. Our reading of the divine name as <italic>Elohim</italic> whenever it is connected to <italic>Adonai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn690">323</xref></sup> the meaning of which is, He<sup><xref rid="fn691">324</xref></sup> is Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn692">325</xref></sup> is proof of the above.<sup><xref rid="fn693">326</xref></sup> This word comes in the plural<sup><xref rid="fn694">327</xref></sup> out of deference to God<sup><xref rid="fn695">328</xref></sup> in the same way that <italic>Elohim</italic> does.<sup><xref rid="fn696">329</xref></sup> Hence if someone addresses the Lord in the same way that he addresses a person and says <italic>Adoni</italic> (my Lord),<sup><xref rid="fn697">330</xref></sup> as in <italic>adoni sha&#x2019;al</italic> (My lord asked) (Gen. 44:19), he errs.</p>
<p>I will now explain the meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn698">331</xref></sup> Know that there are three worlds.<sup><xref rid="fn699">332</xref></sup> One of them, the lower world,<sup><xref rid="fn700">333</xref></sup> consists of objects that are on various levels of importance.<sup><xref rid="fn701">334</xref></sup> However, they can be classified in three groups.<sup><xref rid="fn702">335</xref></sup> The first is the metals, which number seven<sup><xref rid="fn703">336</xref></sup> and correspond to the seven stars.<sup><xref rid="fn704">337</xref></sup> At a higher level come the plants, which have many levels of value. Above them come living things, which have many levels of importance. Man alone is on the highest level in this lower world.<sup><xref rid="fn705">338</xref></sup> Change befalls him in his body. Also his soul changes with his thoughts.<sup><xref rid="fn706">339</xref></sup> Similarly, change befalls his occupation and his affairs.<sup><xref rid="fn707">340</xref></sup> The wise men have compared the genera which is the group that endures although the individuals which make it up perish.<sup><xref rid="fn708">341</xref></sup> The wise men have compared the intransient species to the shadow of a tree upon the ever-running water.<sup><xref rid="fn709">342</xref></sup></p>
<p>The next world is the middle world. It too contains objects that are on various levels of importance. The five ministering stars<sup><xref rid="fn710">343</xref></sup> are very important, as they are self-sufficient and do not die or diminish. Neither do their movements change, enlarge, or shrink. They do not ascend or descend. Howbeit, they do change greatly according to the arrangement.<sup><xref rid="fn711">344</xref></sup> At times a given star<sup><xref rid="fn712">345</xref></sup> is seen in the line of the zodiac; at other times it is seen at a greater or nearer distance to the left,<sup><xref rid="fn713">346</xref></sup> or at a greater or nearer distance to the right.<sup><xref rid="fn714">347</xref></sup> Sometimes it ascends in its epicycle, at other times in its large sphere,<sup><xref rid="fn715">348</xref></sup> for the center of the latter is far from the center of the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn716">349</xref></sup> Sometimes its sphere ascends or descends. At other times it runs. Sometimes it tarries. At other times it stands in its place. Sometimes it goes backwards. All of this is vis-&#x00E0;-vis the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn717">350</xref></sup> Sometimes it is seen. At other times it is hidden. Sometimes it is in the east, at other times in the west. Its relation to its companion,<sup><xref rid="fn718">351</xref></sup> and also to the hosts of heaven above and to the moon below, is indeterminately forever changing because it<sup><xref rid="fn719">352</xref></sup> is sometimes in conjunction with one of the seven fixed stars.<sup><xref rid="fn720">353</xref></sup> Now there are one hundred and twenty conjunctions in each one of the three hundred and sixty degrees.<sup><xref rid="fn721">354</xref></sup> It is due to these irregular movements that different things happen to man&#x2019;s body and certainly to his fortune in this lower world. However, these stars themselves do not change. The moon is therefore on a lower level than they, because whatever happens to the stars happens to the moon, and even more. They<sup><xref rid="fn722">355</xref></sup> have two spheres, neither of which has the earth as its center. Furthermore, the moon&#x2019;s movement in its epicycle is opposite that of the great sphere.<sup><xref rid="fn723">356</xref></sup> Additionally, the moon by herself has no light. Her light comes from the sun. This can be seen from the fact that when the moon is in conjunction with the sun<sup><xref rid="fn724">357</xref></sup> in the head or tail of the dragon<sup><xref rid="fn725">358</xref></sup> during the day, the sun cannot be seen,<sup><xref rid="fn726">359</xref></sup> and if it faces the sun in one of the above-noted places at night<sup><xref rid="fn727">360</xref></sup> the moon is invisible.<sup><xref rid="fn728">361</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the stars that make up the sphere of the constellations are a level above the &#x201C;ministers.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn729">362</xref></sup> They are fixed in one sphere and they do not move as the ministers do. Their distances and relationship to each other do not change. They have one motion; it neither increases nor decreases. Their relationship to the earth is always the same. They appear different according to the place on earth where they are seen and the movement of the sun.</p>
<p>The highest world is the world of the holy angels who are incorporeal and, unlike the souls of men, do not inhabit bodies. Their importance is far and above the understanding of their insignificant counterparts.<sup><xref rid="fn730">363</xref></sup> This entire world is glorious and unchanging. There is no change in its arrangement. This world is not self-sufficient<sup><xref rid="fn731">364</xref></sup> but its existence is dependent upon God the glorious. Man&#x2019;s soul is of this same kind.<sup><xref rid="fn732">365</xref></sup> It receives power from above in accordance to the arrangement of the ministers, that is, the arrangement of each &#x201C;minister&#x201D; vis-&#x00E0;-vis the great hosts at the time of a person&#x2019;s birth. If the soul grows wise it will share the secrets of the angels and will be able to receive great power from an upper power that received it from the light of the angels. The person will then cleave to God the glorious. This is precisely what Jacob meant when he vowed, <italic>then shall the Lord be my God</italic> (Gen. 28:21). Jacob vowed that he would dedicate his entire life to cleave unto God to the fullest of his might. Jacob therefore said, <italic>Put away the strange gods that are among you</italic> (Gen. 35:2). Jacob did not utter these words till this point, for it was only now that he was going to serve God according to his vow. So too, Jethro, who said, <italic>Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods</italic>. (Ex. 18:11).<sup><xref rid="fn733">366</xref></sup> Jethro was a very wise man.<sup><xref rid="fn734">367</xref></sup> Proof of the latter is, <italic>And they asked each other of their welfare</italic> (Ex. 18:7). Additionally, Scripture states, <italic>and bowed down</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>), which implies that Jethro did not stand in awe of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn735">368</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Adam realized that he would die he sired a son so that the human kind would be preserved.<sup><xref rid="fn736">369</xref></sup> He received the power to preserve the human genus.<sup><xref rid="fn737">370</xref></sup> Hence Eve<sup><xref rid="fn738">371</xref></sup> exclaimed, <italic>I have gotten a man with the help of God</italic><sup><xref rid="fn739">372</xref></sup> (Gen. 4:1). Each one of the sons of the prophets<sup><xref rid="fn740">373</xref></sup> used to isolate himself in the hope of being inspired from on high according to his ability. Now it is via this name<sup><xref rid="fn741">374</xref></sup> that new signs and wonders come into this world. When this name was told to Pharaoh<sup><xref rid="fn742">375</xref></sup> he asked for signs and wonders.<sup><xref rid="fn743">376</xref></sup> Therefore this name is not found in the book of Koheleth, as this book speaks of things concerning which nothing can be added nor anything taken away (Eccles. 3:4). It deals with those things concerning which <italic>there is nothing new under the sun</italic> (Eccles. 1:9). It deals with those things which are based on the wisdom that comes from on high.<sup><xref rid="fn744">377</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. GO, AND GATHER. Scripture reads, <italic>the God of Abraham</italic><sup><xref rid="fn745">378</xref></sup> because God made a covenant with Abraham to give him the land of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn746">379</xref></sup></p>
<p>[I HAVE SURELY REMEMBERED YOU.] The meaning of <italic>pakod</italic> (remembered) is that the time of their visitation had come.<sup><xref rid="fn747">380</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND I HAVE SAID. I have previously said to your fathers that <italic>I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt</italic>, the reference being to <italic>and afterward shall they come out with great substance</italic> (Gen. 15:14), and to <italic>and I will also surely bring thee up again</italic> (Gen. 46:4). Or its meaning is, I have now decreed<sup><xref rid="fn748">381</xref></sup> that this<sup><xref rid="fn749">382</xref></sup> shall come to pass, as in <italic>Thou shalt also decree a thing</italic> (Job 22:28).<sup><xref rid="fn750">383</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND THEY SHALL HEARKEN. When the word <italic>shama</italic> (heard) is followed by a <italic>lamed</italic> or <italic>bet</italic> its meaning is not to hear a voice but rather to hear the message which a voice carries.</p>
<p>The <italic>yod</italic> in the word <italic>ha-ivriyyim</italic> (the Hebrews) has a <italic>dagesh</italic> for euphonic purposes. It is there to emphasize the <italic>yod</italic> genitive. The <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>ha-ivrim</italic> (the Hebrews) that follows the <italic>resh</italic> with a <italic>chirik</italic> beneath it is, in accordance with Hebrew grammar, the sign of the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn751">384</xref></sup></p>
<p>HATH MET WITH US. <italic>Nikrah</italic> (hath met) means the same whether spelled with a <italic>heh</italic> or an <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn752">385</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>nikro nikreti</italic><sup><xref rid="fn753">386</xref></sup> (as I happened by chance) (II Sam. 1:6). I will now explain the meaning of <italic>nikrah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn754">387</xref></sup> Its meaning is, <italic>lest he fall upon us</italic> (Ex. 5:3).<sup><xref rid="fn755">388</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND I KNOW THAT THE KING OF EGYPT WILL NOT GIVE YOU. Leave.<sup><xref rid="fn756">389</xref></sup> Or the meaning of <italic>yitten</italic> (give you) is, let, as in <italic>Therefore suffered I thee not</italic> (netatikha) <italic>to touch her</italic> (Gen. 20:6).<sup><xref rid="fn757">390</xref></sup></p>
<p>[EXCEPT BY A MIGHTY HAND.]<sup><xref rid="fn758">391</xref></sup> Neither will he let you go because of his mighty hand.<sup><xref rid="fn759">392</xref></sup> However, Saadiah explains it to mean: neither will he let you go if he is struck once with a mighty hand.<sup><xref rid="fn760">393</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND I WILL PUT FORTH MY HAND. Against his<sup><xref rid="fn761">394</xref></sup> hand.<sup><xref rid="fn762">395</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND I WILL GIVE. The Egyptians&#x2019; appeasing of the Israelites by imploring them to ask for jewels and raiments (which is the meaning of <italic>va-yashilum</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn763">396</xref></sup> was also a great wonder.<sup><xref rid="fn764">397</xref></sup> This is the opposite of the behavior of the world&#x2019;s inhabitants.<sup><xref rid="fn765">398</xref></sup></p>
<p>[EMPTY.] The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>rekam</italic> (empty) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn766">399</xref></sup> The word <italic>rekam</italic> is used in the plural as in our verse.<sup><xref rid="fn767">400</xref></sup> It is also used as a feminine in <italic>Go not empty</italic><sup><xref rid="fn768">401</xref></sup> (Ruth 3:17). The word <italic>chinnam</italic> is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn769">402</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. BUT EVERY WOMEN SHALL ASK. Now elsewhere it is written with regard to both males and females, <italic>and let them ask</italic> (Ex. 11:2).<sup><xref rid="fn770">403</xref></sup> Scripture mentions females here because women are more in the habit of asking their neighbors for jewelry of gold and silver to put on the necks of their sons and daughters. They are likewise in the habit of asking for ear rings, nose rings, bracelets, crescents, and anklets. This is the contemporary custom in Moslem countries. However, the inhabitants of the land of the uncircumcised<sup><xref rid="fn771">404</xref></sup> do not act in this manner. Scripture similarly speaks of a sorceress,<sup><xref rid="fn772">405</xref></sup> as women are more involved in witchcraft than men.<sup><xref rid="fn773">406</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND OF HER THAT SOJOURNETH IN HER HOUSE. For the Israelites owned land.<sup><xref rid="fn774">407</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some complain and say that our ancestors were thieves.<sup><xref rid="fn775">408</xref></sup> Can&#x2019;t these murmurers see that this was a command from on high? There is no sense in asking why? God created everything. He gives riches to whom He desires to give it, and when He wishes to, He takes the very same riches away. There is no evil in this, as everything is His.</p>
<p>AND YE SHALL SPOIL. <italic>Ve-nitzaltem</italic> (and ye shall despoil) is like <italic>ve-dibbartem</italic> (and speak ye)<sup><xref rid="fn776">409</xref></sup> (Num. 20:8), for it is possible that its form is that of the <italic>nifal</italic> conjugation.<sup><xref rid="fn777">410</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ve-niggaftem</italic> (and ye shall be smitten) (Lev. 26:17).</p>
<ftnote id="fn368"><sup>1</sup> It was not yet known as <italic>the mountain of God</italic> since the Lord had not yet revealed Himself on it. However, when Moses wrote the Torah about 40 years later, it was so known. Hence we see that Moses used contemporary terminology when he wrote the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn369"><sup>2</sup> The word comes from the root <italic>chet, resh, bet</italic>, which means dry.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn370"><sup>3</sup> Ex. 5:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn371"><sup>4</sup> The word for flame is <italic>lehavah</italic> (compare Num. 21:28). Those who say that <italic>be-labbat</italic> means in a flame explain that <italic>be-labbat</italic> is short for <italic>be-lahavat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn372"><sup>5</sup> That is, in the midst of the fire. This explains why there is no <italic>heh</italic> in the word <italic>labbat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn373"><sup>6</sup> <italic>Libbatekh</italic> is the word <italic>libbah</italic> (heart) plus the second person pronominal suffix. Thus <italic>libbah</italic> means heart and <italic>labbat</italic> means heart of. It should be noted that the more familiar form for heart is <italic>lev</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn374"><sup>7</sup> Rabbi Adonim ben Tomim, a medieval grammarian.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn375"><sup>8</sup> If <italic>labbat</italic> is the construct form of <italic>libbah</italic> our text should read <italic>libbat</italic> not <italic>labbat</italic>, because <italic>libbah</italic> is vocalized like <italic>ginnah</italic> (garden), and the construct of <italic>ginnah</italic> is <italic>ginnat</italic>, not <italic>gannat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn376"><sup>9</sup> The word for garden may be written <italic>ginnah</italic> or <italic>gannah</italic>. Similarly, the word for heart may be vocalized <italic>libbah</italic> or <italic>labbah</italic>. In the former the construct form is <italic>libbat</italic>, in the latter, <italic>labbat</italic>. The word in our verse follows the paradigm of <italic>labbah</italic>, hence the form <italic>labbat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn377"><sup>10</sup> The word <italic>seneh</italic> has two meanings. It means either a thorn bush or heaven (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn378"><sup>11</sup> Who dwells in heaven (in the <italic>seneh</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn379"><sup>12</sup> A Karaite Bible commentator. See I.E.&#x2019;s introduction to the Pentateuch, Vol. I, p. 3, note 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn380"><sup>13</sup> That is, Deut. 33:16 alludes to God who revealed Himself to Moses in the bush.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn381"><sup>14</sup> Deut. 33:16 literally reads: And the good will of Him that dwelleth in a bush. Now God revealed Himself only once in a bush. Why then would Moses refer to God as &#x201C;the One that dwelleth in a bush,&#x201D; i.e., is always there?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn382"><sup>15</sup> <italic>Po&#x2019;el</italic> is the present form of words in the <italic>kal</italic>. Since God only revealed Himself once in the bush the perfect <italic>shakhan</italic> (dwelt) should have been used.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn383"><sup>16</sup> Translated literally. <italic>Oseh</italic> (makes) is a <italic>po&#x2019;el</italic>, a present form. Now God made heaven and earth at the time of creation. He does not at present make heaven and earth. We thus see that Scripture uses the present form to describe what God did in the past. Now if God is described as making heaven and earth, why can&#x2019;t He be described as dwelling in the bush? I.E. answers that the two can&#x2019;t be compared.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn384"><sup>17</sup> Hence Scripture praises God as the one <italic>Who makes</italic> (oseh) <italic>heaven and earth</italic>. Isaac Husik in <italic>A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy</italic>, J.P.S., Philadelphia, 1940, (p. 190) notes that I.E. &#x201C;seems to favor the idea of eternal creation and maintenance of the universe, the relation of which to God is as the relation of speech to the speaker, which exists only so long as the speaker speaks. The moment he ceases speaking the sounds cease to exist.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn385"><sup>18</sup> Deut. 33:13-16 lists all the good things with which the land of Joseph was blessed, namely, the precious things of heaven, of the sun, of the everlasting hills, and of the earth. It concludes with <italic>And the good will of Him that dwelt in a bush</italic>. If <italic>Him that dwelt in the bush</italic> refers to God, why put the Lord&#x2019;s blessings last (Krinsky)?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn386"><sup>19</sup> God appeared to Moses in the bush via an angel. Why mention this in the verses dealing with the good things with which the land of Joseph was blessed?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn387"><sup>20</sup> Deut. 33:16 literally reads: And the good will of Him that dwells in a bush. However, in view of the fact that God appeared to Moses in a specific bush Scripture should have read: And the good will of Him who dwells in <span class="underline">the</span> bush (<italic>shokhni <span class="underline">ba-seneh</span></italic>) rather than: And the good will of Him that dwells in <span class="underline">a</span> bush (<italic>shokni <span class="underline">seneh</span></italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn388"><sup>21</sup> The bush in which God appeared to Moses, for God does not dwell in any bushes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn389"><sup>22</sup> Contra Saadiah Gaon, <italic>seneh</italic> does not mean a thorn bush or heaven. It has only one meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn390"><sup>23</sup> The Arabic word for thorn is <italic>senna</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn391"><sup>24</sup> Mount Sinai takes its name from the <italic>seneh</italic> which grows there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn392"><sup>25</sup> <italic>And the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn393"><sup>26</sup> <italic>Ha-seneh</italic> (<span class="underline">the</span> bush) implies a distinctive bush. Since there was as of yet nothing special about the bush, Scripture should have read <italic>seneh</italic> (a bush). It should be noted that J.P.S. translates <italic>ha-seneh</italic> as a bush. However, its literal translation is, the bush.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn394"><sup>27</sup> When Moses wrote the Torah he referred to the bush wherein the angel of God appeared to him. See note 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn395"><sup>28</sup> Here there is no doubt that the root <italic>bet, ayin, resh</italic> is transitive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn396"><sup>29</sup> Our clause reads, <italic>ha-seneh bo&#x2019;er ba&#x2019;esh</italic> (the bush burned with fire). I.E. believes this should be explained as if written: <italic>ba-seneh bo&#x2019;er esh</italic> (a fire burnt the bush). He proves that this is the meaning of the clause through Ps. 74:7, which reads: <italic>shilchu va-esh mikdashekha</italic>. The literal meaning is: they have set with fire thy sanctuary. According to I.E. this verse is to be read as if written: <italic>shilchu esh be-mikdashekha</italic> (they have set fire in thy sanctuary) (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn397"><sup>30</sup> Deut. 5:20 reads, <italic>va-ha-har bo&#x2019;er ba-esh</italic> (while the mountain burned with fire). Now mountains do not burn. Hence I.E. says that the verse should be interpreted as: the mountain consumed its environment with fire. I.E. explains thus because he believes <italic>bo&#x2019;er</italic> to be a transitive verb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn398"><sup>31</sup> I.E. refers to participles as adjectives. <italic>Ukkal</italic> (consumed) appears to be a third person <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic> perfect. However, if this were the case it would be vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>, not a <italic>kamatz</italic>, and would have been preceded by <italic>lo</italic>, not by <italic>enennu</italic> (literally, is not).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn399"><sup>32</sup> It is vocalized like a <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic>. If it were <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic> it would read <italic>akhul</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn401"><sup>34</sup> <italic>Prima facie, mu&#x2019;edet</italic> also appears to be a <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic>-like adjective and should be classified as such, along with <italic>ukkal, lukkach, yullad</italic>, and <italic>yukashim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn402"><sup>35</sup> Intransitive words do not come in the <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic> form.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn403"><sup>36</sup> <italic>Mu&#x2019;edet</italic> is a variation of <italic>mo&#x2019;edet</italic>, which is a <italic>po&#x2019;elet</italic>, the <italic>kal</italic> singular participle form that is vocalized <italic>cholam, segol, segol</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn404"><sup>37</sup> The text reads, <italic>asurah na</italic> (I will turn aside now). I.E. believes that this is short for <italic>asurah na mi-mikomi</italic> (I will turn aside now from my place).

<ftnote id="fn408"><sup>41</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verses 1 and 2. At this point Moses did not yet know that God was about to reveal Himself to him. However, Moses later related what had happened earlier.</ftnote>

According to I.E. it was not actually the Lord but the angel of the Lord mentioned in verse 2. The angel is referred to by the Tetragrammaton because the Lord&#x2019;s name is in him. See I.E. on Ex. 23:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn410"><sup>43</sup> Here too an angel spoke to Gideon. Nevertheless, the angel is referred to by the name <italic>YHVH</italic> (the Lord).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn412"><sup>45</sup> The lord told <italic>elohim</italic>, i.e., an angel to call unto Moses. Hence Scripture reads, <italic>God</italic> (elohim) <italic>called unto him</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn428"><sup>61</sup> Hence Moses hid only his eyes. He did not cover his ears or any of his other sensory organs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn429"><sup>62</sup> See note 58.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn430"><sup>63</sup> Our verse records the words of an angel. The angel spoke on behalf of God. Hence it appears as if God Himself was speaking.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn431"><sup>64</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>ra&#x2019;o ra&#x2019;iti</italic> (I have surely seen). The repetition of the verb <italic>ra&#x2019;ah</italic> implies: I have seen what others have not.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn432"><sup>65</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their pains</italic>. I.E. explains that any bystander would hear the cry of a slave in pain. However, only God would know what is in his or her heart. I.E. thus notes that God heard what all hear and knew what others did not know.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn433"><sup>66</sup> <italic>And I am come down</italic> implies that God is only in heaven. I.E. says that Scripture employs this terminology only because the heavens are more glorious than the earth since God is all over.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn434"><sup>67</sup> God&#x2019;s glory fills both heaven and earth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn435"><sup>68</sup> An apparently different interpretation of <italic>And I am come down</italic>. I.E. first proposed that it is used out of respect for God. He now suggests that it refers to God&#x2019;s decrees.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn436"><sup>69</sup> Angels are superior to prophets. See I.E. on Gen. 1:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn437"><sup>70</sup> The dwelling place of the angels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn438"><sup>71</sup> The angel came down to Moses because Moses could not go up to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn439"><sup>72</sup> The angel came down to bring Israel up out of Egypt.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn443"><sup>76</sup> Which shows that Israel was brought to a high place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn444"><sup>77</sup> I.E. explains that &#x201C;bring up&#x201D; is not to be taken literally; i.e., Israel was not taken from a geographically low area to a geographically high area. &#x201C;Bring up&#x201D; rather means to be taken from poverty in Egypt to <italic>a good land, and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn446"><sup>79</sup> Nations inhabiting Canaan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn447"><sup>80</sup> Canaan was the father of 11 sons. Six became nations with names of their own. Canaan was not a particular nation. Why then mention him?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn448"><sup>81</sup> The term Canaanites includes all the descendants of Canaan, those who became nations and those that did not. Here it refers to both the Girgashite, who because of his size was not mentioned by name, as well as the other descendants of Canaan who did not develop into nations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn449"><sup>82</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s reason for this identification is unknown.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn450"><sup>83</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Ex. 2:23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn451"><sup>84</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>ve-attah lekha</italic> (come now therefore). I.E. renders the latter as: and now go, i.e., now go as my agent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn452"><sup>85</sup> Both words are used in the Bible for I.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn453"><sup>86</sup> <italic>Attah</italic> is short for <italic>antah</italic> and <italic>attem</italic> for <italic>antem</italic>. The omitted <italic>nuns</italic> are compensated for by a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>tavs</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn454"><sup>87</sup> One who addresses someone is, at it were, saying to the addressee, whither (<italic>an</italic>) are you standing? Where am I standing? Hence the pronouns <italic>ani, attah</italic> (antah), <italic>attem</italic> (antem).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn455"><sup>88</sup> The personal pronoun <italic>anokhi</italic>, like a plumbline (<italic>anakh</italic>), indicates the exact place of the person who is speaking. According to I.E. the personal pronoun <italic>anokhi</italic> means: I who stand here. It is thus similar to a plumbline.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn456"><sup>89</sup> <italic>Nechushtekh</italic> is derived from <italic>nechoshet</italic> (copper). <italic>Nechoshet</italic> is a strong metal. It serves as a base. Hence by extension it refers to the base (bottom) of a person. For the meaning of <italic>nechushtekh</italic> as bottom, see I.E. on Ezek. 16:36. Similarly, <italic>anokhi</italic> (I) is derived from <italic>anakh</italic> (plumbline).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn460"><sup>93</sup> According to I.E. our verse contains two elements: an allusion to the burning bush (the token) and a promise that Israel will serve God on the mountain upon which God first appeared to Moses.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn463"><sup>96</sup> It took Israel three months, not three days to reach Sinai. <italic>Prima facie</italic>, this contradicts I.E.&#x2019;s assertion that Ex. 8:23 refers to a request to go to Mount Sinai. I.E. answers that it took Israel three months to reach Sinai because they did not take a direct route.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn464"><sup>97</sup> It took Israel three months to reach Sinai because they spent a lot of time in their encampments on the way to Sinai.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn468"><sup>101</sup> The Tetragrammaton (read <italic>Adonai</italic> and translated as Lord).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn469"><sup>102</sup> A Karaite Bible commentator. See Vol. I, Introduction, note 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn470"><sup>103</sup> God here appears to be revealing a new name, the Tetragrammaton. Also see Ex. 6:2,3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn471"><sup>104</sup> In this verse the Tetragrammaton is used. We find that it is also used in other revelations to the patriarchs. We thus see that the Tetragrammaton was known in pre-Mosaic times.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn472"><sup>105</sup> In writing the account of the patriarchs Moses used the name of God that was revealed to him. However, God actually used the name <italic>El Shaddai</italic> (God Almighty) when he revealed Himself to the patriarchs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn473"><sup>106</sup> From Gen. 1, 2:3 the Bible refers to the Deity as <italic>Elohim</italic> (God). If Moses had employed the name that he knew in writing Genesis, he would have used the Tetragrammaton in Gen. 1, 2:3 as well. Hence we may deduce that Moses was very exact with regard to the names of God when he wrote the Torah and employed the names of the Lord that were applicable to the time or event concerning which he wrote.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn474"><sup>107</sup> It does not refer to God as <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn475"><sup>108</sup> The Tetragrammaton.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn476"><sup>109</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s translation. J.P.S. renders &#x201C;mighty thunderings.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn477"><sup>110</sup> Moses was emphasizing to Pharaoh that it is the Lord (<italic>YHVH</italic>) who is the <italic>Elohim</italic> that Pharaoh referred to (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn478"><sup>111</sup> Where Moses refers to God as Elohim. We thus see that Moses was exact when using the names of God. Hence the names used in Genesis were the names used in the period that Scripture speaks of.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn479"><sup>112</sup> According to I.E. <italic>That I Am</italic> explains <italic>I Am</italic>. In other words, God&#x2019;s name is not <italic>I Am That I Am</italic>. His name is <italic>I Am</italic>, the meaning of which is, that I am.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn480"><sup>113</sup> Translated literally. God in this verse does not refer to the Deity but as the verse itself explains, adverts to an angel of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn481"><sup>114</sup> <italic>YHVH</italic> (the Tetragrammaton read as if written <italic>Adonai</italic>) and <italic>EHYH</italic> (I am) have the same basic meaning. They differ only in form.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn482"><sup>115</sup> The root of both names is <italic>heh, yod, heh. EHYH</italic> (I am) is a first person form. <italic>YHVH</italic> is a third person form.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn484"><sup>117</sup> God&#x2019;s proper name is sounded <italic>Adonai</italic>. It is prohibited to sound out its true consonants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn485"><sup>118</sup> That is, a proper name indicates a specific person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn486"><sup>119</sup> I.E. also refers to common nouns as adjectives.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn489"><sup>122</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that an adjective is derived from a verb. Thus the adjective <italic>chakham</italic> (wise, intelligent) is derived from a verb meaning to become wise.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn490"><sup>123</sup> A proper noun cannot be conjugated because it has no verbal form.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn491"><sup>124</sup> From the root <italic>tzadi, chet, kof</italic>, meaning laughed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn492"><sup>125</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that although the root of Isaac can be conjugated, the proper name itself cannot be conjugated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn493"><sup>126</sup> One does not say, he is an Isaac, or he was Abrahamed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn494"><sup>127</sup> Israel (<italic>yisra&#x2019;el</italic>) is both the name of a person and the name of a nation. If we want to say that an individual is an Israelite we use the term <italic>yisra&#x2019;eli</italic>. If we want to say that two or more people are Israelites we use the term <italic>yisra&#x2019;elim</italic> (Israelites). However, if there are two people named Israel in a place, we do not say there are two Israels there (which is proper in English), because the name of individuals does not come in the plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn495"><sup>128</sup> That is, the word <italic>chakham</italic> can be written with the definite article (<italic>he-chakham</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn496"><sup>129</sup> <italic>Prima facie, kohelet</italic> is a proper name. Nevertheless, it has a definite article attached to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn497"><sup>130</sup> By Solomon. The root of <italic>kohelet</italic> is <italic>kof, heh, lamed</italic>, meaning to gather.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn498"><sup>131</sup> Adam was the name of the first man. Yet this proper noun has a definite article before it (<italic>ha-adam</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn499"><sup>132</sup> That is, it is not a personal name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn500"><sup>133</sup> It refers to all of mankind. See I.E. on Gen. 2:8 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn501"><sup>134</sup> <italic>Menashah</italic> (Manasseh) is a proper noun. Yet it has the definite article prefixed to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn502"><sup>135</sup> It refers to the tribe of Manasseh. Hence Manasseh in this verse is a common rather than a proper noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn503"><sup>136</sup> It does not have a construct form.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn504"><sup>137</sup> Hence they do not come in the construct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn505"><sup>138</sup> Wherein <italic>Adonai</italic> is apparently in the construct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn506"><sup>139</sup> That is, a proper name of God. According to this interpretation Scripture here uses two personal names of God back to back as it does in Is. 12:2, in which we find <italic>Yah Adonai</italic>. Hence <italic>Adonai tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> should be rendered, Lord Hosts, not Lord of hosts, for <italic>Adonai</italic> is not in the construct with <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn507"><sup>140</sup> Literally, a token or sign in His host. Cf. <italic>Haggigah</italic> 16a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn508"><sup>141</sup> According to the Talmud <italic>Adonai tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> means: Lord among His hosts. The Talmud thus interpreted <italic>Adonai tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> as <italic>Adonai be-tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic>. The Talmud did so because <italic>Adonai</italic> cannot come in the construct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn509"><sup>142</sup> Here <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> has a definite article prefixed to it. Hence it cannot be a personal name. For the same reason, <italic>Adonai tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> cannot be interpreted to mean the Lord is outstanding among His hosts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn510"><sup>143</sup> The text has <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic>. However, this appears to be a scribal error, for I.E. goes on to say, &#x201C;Do not be bothered by the phrase <italic>Adonai Elohim tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic>.&#x201D; Why should the latter present any problem to I.E.&#x2019;s assertion that the name <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> is only found connected to <italic>Adonai</italic> or <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic> when in this case it is connected to <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic>? Furthermore, I.E. limits the use of the term &#x201C;the glorious name of God&#x201D; to <italic>Adonai</italic>. He does not use it in reference to <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic>. Hence we should read, &#x201C;or to God&#x2019;s glorious name, <italic>Adonai</italic>,&#x201D; and omit the word <italic>Elohim</italic> (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn511"><sup>144</sup> Where <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> is connected to <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic> (Krinsky) or where <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> seems to be a personal name, for the verse appears to read, &#x201C;0 Lord God, Hosts.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn512"><sup>145</sup> For grammatical reasons this verse has to be read as if written: <italic>ve-hanevu&#x2019;ah nevu&#x2019;at oded ha-navi</italic>. That is, the word <italic>nevu&#x2019;at</italic> is implied in the word <italic>ve-hanevu&#x2019;ah</italic>. See I.E. on Gen. 2:9. Similarly, in our phrase the word <italic>Elohe</italic> is implied in the word <italic>Elohim</italic>. Our phrase is thus to be read: <italic>Adonai Elohim Elohe ha-tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn513"><sup>146</sup> I.E. will soon note that when the name Lord is used as an adjective it means the maintainer of the universe.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn514"><sup>147</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s rendering of this verse (Krinsky). Here the name <italic>moshe</italic> is used as a verb or an adjective. I.E. refers to verbs in the present as adjectives. Similarly, the name <italic>Adonai</italic> is used as an adjective.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn515"><sup>148</sup> <italic>Elohim</italic> means the angels (see I.E. on Gen 1:1). In the phrase <italic>Adonai Elohim, Adonai</italic> is in the construct with <italic>Elohim</italic>. Thus the meaning of the phrase is: Lord of the angels. Here <italic>Adonai</italic> is an &#x201C;adjective,&#x201D; as it is in the construct. According to I.E., <italic>Adonai tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> means: the One who maintains the world via the agency of the angels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn516"><sup>149</sup> The angels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn517"><sup>150</sup> According to Saadiah Gaon <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> refers to Israel. Hence Lord of hosts means Lord of Israel. I.E. disagrees. According to I.E. it means Lord over the angels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn518"><sup>151</sup> That <italic>tzeva&#x2019;ot</italic> (hosts) refers to the angels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn519"><sup>152</sup> Which implies that God is called Lord of hosts because the hosts of heaven are His servants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn520"><sup>153</sup> I.E. noted above that a proper name has no plural form. Since the name <italic>Elohim</italic> comes both in the singular and the plural it cannot be a proper name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn521"><sup>154</sup> <italic>Elo&#x2019;a</italic> is the singular of <italic>Elohim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn522"><sup>155</sup> Another point proving that <italic>Elohim</italic> cannot be a proper name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn523"><sup>156</sup> <italic>Elohe</italic> (God of) is the construct form of <italic>Elohim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn524"><sup>157</sup> <italic>El</italic> and <italic>Shaddai</italic> are the names of God. They are not proper names. Hence according to I.E. they are classified as adjectives.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn525"><sup>158</sup> Rendered according to I.E. These verses prove that <italic>shaddai</italic> means mighty.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn526"><sup>159</sup> I.E. now goes on to give a mystical explanation of God&#x2019;s name based on numerology. God&#x2019;s personal name is written <italic>YHVH</italic> (<italic>yod, heh, vav, heh</italic>) or <italic>EHYH</italic> (<italic>alef, heh, yod, heh</italic>). Thus God&#x2019;s name is written with the letters <italic>alef</italic> (numerically equal to 1), <italic>heh</italic> (5), <italic>vav</italic> (6), and <italic>yod</italic> (10).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn527"><sup>160</sup> 1 through 9. For the number 10 is like the number 1. See below.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn528"><sup>161</sup> Counting 10 as a number.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn529"><sup>162</sup> That is:</ftnote>
<ftnote><img src="images/Art_P1.jpg" alt="art" /></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn530"><sup>163</sup> The number 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn531"><sup>164</sup> If we multiply each of the numbers in the circle by 9, we get the following: 9x9&#x003D;81; 9x8&#x003D;72; 9x7&#x003D;63; 9x6&#x003D;54; 9x5&#x003D;45; 9x4&#x003D;36; 9x3&#x003D;27; 9x2&#x003D;18; 9x1&#x003D;9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn532"><sup>165</sup> The numbers 1 through 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn533"><sup>166</sup> In the number 72, 7 is the ten number and 2 is a one number, for 72 i s 7x10&#x002B;2. Now in the numbers 81, 72, 63, and 54 the ten number is on the right and the one number on the left.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn534"><sup>167</sup> After number 5 the numbers reverse themselves, i.e., 54 to 45 (9x5), 63 to 36 (9x4), 72 to 27 (9x3), and 81 to 18 (9x2). Thus what was originally a ten number becomes a one number and what was a one number becomes a ten number. The number that was on the left goes to the right and the number on the right goes to the left.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn535"><sup>168</sup> Up to this point I.E. explains the argument for only 9 numbers. He now goes on to explain the argument for 10 numbers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn536"><sup>169</sup> There are no new numbers beyond the number 10; i.e., anything above 10 is 10 plus some individual number. Upon reaching the next 100 the count begins again.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn537"><sup>170</sup> The number 11 is 10&#x002B;1. Thus we cannot begin to count one above 10 without having 10. Hence 10 is one of the numbers. I.E. should be paraphrased as: for one cannot count 11 (10&#x002B;1) without 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn538"><sup>171</sup> It makes up one 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn539"><sup>172</sup> The number 10 includes all the numbers up to 10, i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn540"><sup>173</sup> That is, of the tens 10 is the first of the tens in the same way that the ones are the first of the first 9 numbers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn541"><sup>174</sup> That is, 100 through 900 corresponds to 1 through 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn542"><sup>175</sup> That is, 1,000 through 9,000 corresponds to 1 through 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn543"><sup>176</sup> One myriad corresponds to 1, two myriads to 2, three myriads to 3, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn544"><sup>177</sup> That is, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn545"><sup>178</sup> That is, the numbers 1 through 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn546"><sup>179</sup> One is a tenth of 10. The other numbers can be treated in the same manner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn547"><sup>180</sup> The number 20 consists of 2x10, the number 30, 3x10, and so on.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn549"><sup>182</sup> Multiplying 10 and adding a one number to it. For example, 23 is 10x2&#x002B;3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn550"><sup>183</sup> I.E. now offers an additional illustration of the importance of the letters/numbers <italic>alef</italic> (1), <italic>heh</italic> (5), <italic>vav</italic> (6), <italic>and yod</italic> (10) which make up the divine name (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn551"><sup>184</sup> The letters/numbers <italic>alef</italic> (1) through <italic>heh</italic> (5) correspond to the fingers of one hand and the letters/numbers <italic>vav</italic> (6) through <italic>yod</italic> (10) correspond to the fingers of the other hand.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn552"><sup>185</sup> According to Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s cosmology, there are 10 spheres surrounding the earth, each a revolving, imperceptible domain containing a heavenly body that revolves within the invisible matter comprising it. There are two for the sun and the moon; five for the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; one for the zodiac and one for the diurnal sphere. The highest of all is the throne of glory, which also comprises all of the spheres and actuates them. The heavenly bodies receive their various properties from the tenth sphere (Lev. 27:32), the realm of holiness from which the natural forces emanate (E. Levine, Introduction to <italic>Vat.

<ftnote id="fn558"><sup>191</sup> I.E. now explains the uniqueness of the number one. He points out that numbers that end in one, have one in their square. Other numbers, with the exception of 5, 6, and 10, do not have this quality.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn559"><sup>192</sup> That is, its cube. A cubed number that ends in one has one in its root; e.g., 1,331 is the cube of 11. I.E. refers to a cube as the counterpart of a square because a square is formed by multiplying a number by itself, while a cube is formed by multiplying a number by itself three times.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn560"><sup>193</sup> That is, in the number 25. The same holds for the cube of 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn561"><sup>194</sup> That is, in the number 36. The same holds for the cube of 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn562"><sup>195</sup> The 1 (<italic>alef</italic>), 5 (<italic>heh</italic>), 6(<italic>vav</italic>), and 10 (<italic>yod</italic>) are not lost when squared as other numbers are. For example, the number 2 is not seen in 4. However, 5 maintains its identity in its square, 25. So too with the numbers 1, 6, and 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn563"><sup>196</sup> Any number imaginable is made up of ones.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn564"><sup>197</sup> Every existing number consists of a number of ones.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn565"><sup>198</sup> All the numbers have two sides, i.e., a preceding number and a following number. For example, the number 5 is preceded by 4 and followed by 6. However, the number one has no preceding number. All numbers are half the sum of the preceding and following numbers; e.g., 2 is half the sum of 1 and 3, 5 is half the sum of 4 and 6, and 6 is half the sum of 5 and 7. One is half the sum of 2, without having a preceding number. Hence the number one accomplishes with one side what the others need two sides to accomplish.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn566"><sup>199</sup> 1 squared &#x002B; 2 squared&#x003D;5.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn570"><sup>203</sup> With the exception of one, whose uniqueness I.E. has just pointed out.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn571"><sup>204</sup> For example, the relationship of 4 cubed (64) to 4 squared &#x002B; 8 squared (80) is 4:5. The relationship of 3 cubed (27) to 3 squared &#x002B; 6 squared (45) is 3:5. The relationship of 2 cubed (8) to 2 squared &#x002B; 4 squared (20) is 2:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn572"><sup>205</sup> Above 5 the relationship of a number cubed to the sum of its square changes. Above 5 the cube is higher than the sum of its squared numbers whereas below 5 it is lower than the sum of its squares (see note 204). For example, 6 cubed is 216, 6 squared is 36, and 12 squared is 144; 36&#x002B;144&#x003D; 180. The relationship between 216 and 180 is 6:5. We thus see the following: below 5 the cube of a number is less than the sum of that number squared plus the square of its double. At 5 the cube is equal to the number squared then doubled and squared. Above 5 the cube is greater by the ratio of that number to 5 than the number squared then doubled and squared. Hence 5 is a very special number.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn575"><sup>208</sup> I.E. now goes on to explain the significance of the letter <italic>yod</italic> (numerically equivalent to 10) of God&#x2019;s name.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn577"><sup>210</sup> Literally, the result equals the similar number. I.E. calls the number 10 the similar number because 10 is similar to 1. See note 173.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn580"><sup>213</sup> Line AB is 10 units long. Line CD is a third of the way up. Lines AC and AD are equal. Triangle ACD is equal to the circumference of the circle. According to I.E. this shows the excellence of the number 10. Of course, one is area and the other linear, but the number, 31.4, is the same. However, it should be pointed out that they are not exactly equal, as we can see if we carry out the calculations; the circumference is equal to 31.4159 while the triangle&#x2019;s area is equal to 31.4269.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn582"><sup>215</sup> If another line is drawn a third of the way down along the line bisecting the circle and its points connected, a rectangle is formed. The number representing the area of this rectangle will equal the number representing the circumference of the circle.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn585"><sup>218</sup> Under 10 the ratio of the area of the triangle or rectangle to the circumference of the circle will be equal to the ratio of the diameter of the circle to 10, i.e., area/circumference&#x003D;diameter/10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn586"><sup>219</sup> In cases under 10 the circumference of the circle is greater than the area of the inscribed triangle or rectangle. The reverse is true in cases where the triangle is greater than 10; i.e., the area is greater than the circumference. The basic error involved in the text discussed in note 213 and this note i s that I.E. assumes that two quantities, one involved in circumference and one involved in area, are equal, when in fact they are not, although they are very close.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn589"><sup>222</sup> The letters <italic>mem, nun, tzadi, peh</italic>, and <italic>kaf</italic> come in two forms, regular and final. If the final forms of the aforementioned letters are counted as separate letters, then the Hebrew alphabet has 27 rather than 22 letters. Hence I.E. notes that the variant forms of these letters are not considered as separate letters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn590"><sup>223</sup> For example the <italic>nun</italic> becomes a final <italic>nun</italic>, the <italic>tzadi</italic> becomes a final <italic>tzadi</italic>, the <italic>feh</italic> becomes a final <italic>feh</italic>, and the <italic>kof</italic> becomes a final <italic>kof</italic>. I.E. speaks of four of the five double letters, since the final <italic>mem</italic> is a square and thus is not straightened out to form a line. Nevertheless, it is not counted as a separate letter because it is merely a variant of the normal letter.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn597"><sup>230</sup> For they: a) contain the letters that are used in the Tetragrammaton; b) not only serve as root letters but also serve as prefixes, suffixes, and prepositions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn598"><sup>231</sup> The letters of the second group are easier to sound than those of the first group because they are used more often.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn599"><sup>232</sup> These letters are easy to pronounce and, as already explained by I.E., are of great significance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn600"><sup>233</sup> When the vowels are sounded, these consonants are used. For example, when the <italic>chirik</italic> or <italic>tzere</italic> is enunciated, the <italic>yod</italic> is sounded; when the <italic>kamatz</italic> is enunciated, the <italic>alef</italic> and <italic>heh</italic> are sounded; when the <italic>cholam and shuruk</italic> are sounded, the <italic>vav</italic> is enunciated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn601"><sup>234</sup> They can be used in place of vowels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn602"><sup>235</sup> At times the <italic>alef, heh, yod</italic>, and <italic>vav</italic> are not sounded, i.e., the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>bereshit</italic>, the <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>rishon</italic>, the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>parah</italic>, and the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>beni</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn603"><sup>236</sup> For example, the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>shosayikh</italic> (Jer. 30:16), the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>redah</italic> (Gen. 45:10) (the usual form is <italic>red</italic>), the <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>ma&#x2019;ayeno</italic> (Ps. 79:2) (the usual form is <italic>ma&#x2019;ayan</italic>), the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>shokhni</italic> (Deut. 33:16) (the usual form is <italic>shokhen</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn604"><sup>237</sup> For example, the <italic>alef</italic> is missing in the word <italic>banu</italic> (I Sam. 25:8), the <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>hokhachta</italic> (Gen. 24:14), the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>yered</italic> (Gen. 42:38), and the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>shema&#x2019;an</italic> (Gen. 4:23) (the usual form is <italic>shemanah</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn605"><sup>238</sup> The letters are dropped and a <italic>dagesh</italic> compensates for them.

In all of these instances the missing letter is compensated for by placing a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the following letter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn606"><sup>239</sup> The <italic>alef</italic> interchanges with the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>ata</italic> (Is. 21:12), the <italic>heh</italic> with the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>refah</italic> (Ps. 5:4), the <italic>vav</italic> with the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>mippo</italic> (Ezek. 40:10), the <italic>vav</italic> with the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>yokhlu</italic> (Ezek. 42:5), and the <italic>yod</italic> with the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>nibbeta</italic> (Jer. 26:4).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn607"><sup>240</sup> The <italic>ayin</italic> is the hardest guttural to pronounce. Hence it is the first guttural. Next comes the <italic>chet</italic>, the second hardest guttural to pronounce (Weiser). Then comes the <italic>heh</italic>, followed by the <italic>alef</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn608"><sup>241</sup> Only the first letter of a guttural spelled out is a guttural. The others are not. For example, <italic>ayin</italic> is spelled <italic>ayin, yod, nun</italic>. Only the <italic>ayin</italic> is a guttural. The <italic>yod</italic> and <italic>nun</italic> are not. We find this to be the case with all of the gutturals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn609"><sup>242</sup> It is best to refer to the <italic>ayin</italic> and <italic>alef</italic> as the ah sounds, to the <italic>chet</italic> as the cha sound, and to the <italic>heh</italic> as the ha sound. In this way the guttural sound is fully enunciated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn610"><sup>243</sup> The reference is to the Christians. They cannot properly sound the <italic>ayin</italic> or <italic>chet</italic>, as there is no equivalent sound in the Latin alphabet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn611"><sup>244</sup> Since these gutturals are easy to pronounce they were chosen to serve as prefixes, suffixes, and prepositions. The medieval grammarians refer to letters which serve as prefixes, suffixes, and prepositions as <italic>me&#x2019;sharitim</italic>, ministering letters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn612"><sup>245</sup> Hence, with the exception of the <italic>shin</italic>, they serve only as root letters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn613"><sup>246</sup> Since half of the Hebrew alphabet serve as ministering letters and only one dental was chosen as a ministering letter. Three labials were chosen to complete the complement of 11 ministering letters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn614"><sup>247</sup> The head is on top of the body. The throat, the top of which is connected to the head, is the first organ to produce speech. Hence the alphabet opens with a guttural (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn615"><sup>248</sup> It lies at the bottom of the head but its sound is heard in the mouth, which is above it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn616"><sup>249</sup> The <italic>heh</italic>, the second most easily pronounced guttural, was chosen to represent the fifth letter of the alphabet, which serves as the number 5. This is so, as I.E. has previously explained, because the number 5 is a glorious number. A guttural was chosen to represent this number because the guttural was made by the &#x201C;first&#x201D; organ in the body.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn617"><sup>250</sup> The order of the organs producing speech are: throat, palate, tongue, teeth, and lips. Now since the first letter of the alphabet is produced by the throat, I.E. believes it is only right that the second be produced by the lips, the last organ in the head to produce speech.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn618"><sup>251</sup> Since a labial (the <italic>bet</italic>) follows the first guttural of the alphabet (the <italic>alef</italic>), a labial (a <italic>vav</italic>) follows the guttural <italic>heh</italic> and a labial (a <italic>peh</italic>) follows the guttural <italic>ayin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn619"><sup>252</sup> The palate is the second organ of speech, the tongue the third, and the teeth the fourth. The master of the Hebrew language decided to follow the order of the organs of the body in choosing the first, third, fourth, and sixth letters. He did not follow this order for the second and fifth letters because of the reasons already noted by I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn620"><sup>253</sup> The <italic>yod</italic>. The implied letters are <italic>alef, heh, vav</italic>, and <italic>yod</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn687"><sup>320</sup> The reference is to the sages of the Talmud. See notes 322 and 323.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn688"><sup>321</sup> The point is that Moses, being holy, was permitted to sound out God&#x2019;s name. However, later generations not as holy were prohibited from sounding out God&#x2019;s name and therefore had to substitute <italic>Adonai</italic> for <italic>YHVH</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn689"><sup>322</sup> That is, <italic>My memorial</italic> means <italic>My name</italic>. I.E. takes issue with the Talmudic statement that the term <italic>My name</italic> refers to the way God&#x2019;s name is written (<italic>YHVH</italic>) and <italic>My memorial</italic> to the way that God&#x2019;s name is sounded (<italic>Adonai</italic>). Cf. <italic>Kiddushin</italic> 71a: &#x201C;<italic>This is My name forever</italic> (le&#x2019;olam); it is written <italic>le&#x2019;alem</italic> (to be concealed; i.e., God&#x2019;s name is not ordinarily to be sounded)&#x2026;R. Abina raised the following contradiction: It is written, <italic>This is My name</italic> to be concealed (<italic>le&#x2019;alem</italic>). Then it is written, <italic>This is my memorial</italic> (which indicates that God&#x2019;s name is to be enunciated). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Not as My name is written shall it be pronounced. It is written <italic>Yod Heh</italic> (<italic>Vav Heh</italic>), but is pronounced <italic>Alef Dalet</italic> (<italic>Nun Yod-Adonai</italic>).&#x201D; I.E. believes that the latter is aggadic and is not the literal meaning of the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn690"><sup>323</sup> Whenever the text reads <italic>Adonai YHVH</italic> we read it as <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic>. Cf. Deut. 3:34; Hab. 3:19. If the original reading of <italic>YHVH</italic> was <italic>Adonai</italic> we would read <italic>Adonai YHVH</italic> as <italic>Adonai Adonai</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn691"><sup>324</sup> <italic>YHVH</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn692"><sup>325</sup> The term <italic>Adonai</italic> was chosen as a substitute for <italic>YHVH</italic>. This substitution indicates that <italic>YHVH</italic> is Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn693"><sup>326</sup> That <italic>Adonai</italic> is not the original pronunciation of <italic>YHVH</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn694"><sup>327</sup> <italic>Adonai</italic> is a plural. It literally means my Lords.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn695"><sup>328</sup> &#x201C;It is considered a sign of dignity to employ the plural when speaking of a superior&#x201D; (I.E. on Gen. 1:1).</ftnote>

Our text arose from the incorporation into it of various glosses that were written to explain I.E.&#x2019;s somewhat vague sentence. His point is that the wise men compared the relationship of the eternal species, with regard to the transient individual, to the shadow that a tree casts upon moving water. The branch which casts the shadow remains, but the shadow keeps on changing because of the movement of the water.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn710"><sup>343</sup> Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They, in contradistinction to the sun and moon are unchangeable.</ftnote>

The forms of the latter change while that of the former never do. However, I.E. speaks of movements, not of forms. Rabbi Joseph Ha-Sephardi suggests that what I.E. means is that the motion of the sun and moon actually changes while that of the ministering stars only appears to change. What I.E. apparently is saying is that the movement of the five &#x201C;ministers,&#x201D; left to themselves, would not change. However, the heavens are so arranged that their movements do change.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn712"><sup>345</sup> The reference is to one of the &#x201C;ministering&#x201D; stars.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn716"><sup>349</sup> This sphere is so called because the earth is not its center.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn717"><sup>350</sup> In reality there is no change in the movements of these stars. These movements only seem to change because they are viewed from earth (Joseph ben Eliezer Ha-Sephardi). See <italic>Yesod Mora</italic>, Chap. 12.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn744"><sup>377</sup> The book of Ecclesiastes deals with natural law. However, the name <italic>YHVH</italic> changes natural law. Hence it would be misplaced in Ecclesiastes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn745"><sup>378</sup> The name God is not repeated in our verse with Isaac or with Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn746"><sup>379</sup> Canaan was first promised to Abraham (Gen. 15:18). God then promised Isaac and Jacob that he would keep the promise made to Abraham (Gen. 26:3-5; 35:11, 12) (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn747"><sup>380</sup> The root <italic>peh, kof, dalet</italic> means to visit (cf. Ex. 20:5). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that <italic>pakod pakadti</italic> (I have surely remembered) means that the time that I should visit you (and keep my promise) has come. See Gen. 21:1 and the use of the word <italic>pakad</italic> therein.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn748"><sup>381</sup> <italic>Va-omar</italic>, usually translated as and I have said, here means: and I have decreed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn749"><sup>382</sup> What follows, in the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn750"><sup>383</sup> Job 22:28 reads, <italic>ve-tigzar omer</italic>. What it means is: <italic>ve-tigzar ge-zerah</italic>. We thus see that the root <italic>alef, mem, resh</italic> sometimes means to decree. Hence <italic>va-omar</italic> may be rendered: and I have decreed, rather than, and I have said.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn751"><sup>384</sup> <italic>Chirik yod mem</italic> is the sign of the plural (<italic>ivrim, yeladim</italic>, etc.). <italic>Chirik yod</italic> indicates membership in a group (compare, <italic>ivri, yehudi, yisra&#x2019;eli</italic>). Now when the two <italic>yods</italic> come together the gentilic <italic>yod</italic> is usually dropped. In our verse not only do we have two <italic>yods</italic>, but one of them receives a <italic>dagesh</italic> (thus doubling it). The extra <italic>yod</italic> and the <italic>dagesh</italic> are in our word for euphonic purposes, i.e., to emphasize the gentilic <italic>yod</italic> (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn752"><sup>385</sup> Here the word is spelled with a <italic>heh</italic>. In Ex. 5:3 it is spelled with an <italic>alef</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn753"><sup>386</sup> <italic>Nikro</italic> is spelled with an <italic>alef. Nikreti</italic> comes from the root <italic>kof, resh, heh</italic>, for the <italic>yod</italic> takes the place of the <italic>heh</italic> in a first person perfect. Compare, <italic>nikrah</italic> in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn754"><sup>387</sup> In Ex. 5:3 I.E. explains that <italic>nikrah</italic> (met) means the same as <italic>pagah</italic> (fall upon).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn755"><sup>388</sup> That is, <italic>nikrah</italic> means fall upon, as in <italic>lest he fall upon us</italic> (Netter).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn756"><sup>389</sup> The word leave or permission must be added to the text. Our verse literally reads: And I know that the king of Egypt will not give (<italic>yitten</italic>) you to go.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn757"><sup>390</sup> In this case nothing is missing from the text. Our verse reads: And I know that the king of Egypt will not let (<italic>yitten</italic>) you go.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn758"><sup>391</sup> The text literally reads: and not by a mighty hand. Hence the two explanations which follow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn759"><sup>392</sup> Pharaoh&#x2019;s hand is mighty and he therefore sees no reason to let you go.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn760"><sup>393</sup> In other words, it will take more than one plague to get Pharaoh to change his mind.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn761"><sup>394</sup> Pharaoh&#x2019;s.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn762"><sup>395</sup> God will show Pharaoh that His hand is mightier than Pharaoh&#x2019;s hand.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn763"><sup>396</sup> The word <italic>va-yashilum</italic> (so that they let them have what they asked) is found in Ex. 12:36. I.E. renders <italic>va-yashilum:</italic> they implored them to ask.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn764"><sup>397</sup> Not only the plagues were wondrous. This too was a wonder.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn765"><sup>398</sup> People don&#x2019;t go around imploring others to ask them for things.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn766"><sup>399</sup> Its root is <italic>resh, yod, kof</italic>. The <italic>mem</italic> has no meaning and apparently serves no purpose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn767"><sup>400</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>lo telekhu rekam</italic> (ye shall not go empty). <italic>Telekhu</italic> is a masculine plural. Hence <italic>rekam</italic> too must be a masculine plural. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the Bible employs the term <italic>rekam</italic> with the masculine feminine and the plural. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Gen. 31:42 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn768"><sup>401</sup> <italic>Tavo&#x2019;i</italic> (go) is a feminine singular. Hence <italic>rekam</italic> (empty) too must be a feminine singular. Cf. I.E. on Gen. 31:42 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn769"><sup>402</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 31:42 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn770"><sup>403</sup> We thus see that both males and females did the asking. The question thus arises: Why did Scripture state here that <italic>every woman shall ask</italic>?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn771"><sup>404</sup> Christian countries.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn772"><sup>405</sup> Ex. 22:17 states, <italic>Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live</italic>. The same applies to a sorcerer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn773"><sup>406</sup> Cf. <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 67a, <italic>Yerushalmi Sanhedrin</italic> 7:3, and Rashi and I.E. on Ex. 22:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn774"><sup>407</sup> Hence they had rooms or houses to rent to Egyptians. See I.E. on Gen. 47:27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn775"><sup>408</sup> For they asked the Egyptians for goods and had no intention of returning them or paying for them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn776"><sup>409</sup> That is, <italic>ve-nitzaltem</italic> is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn777"><sup>410</sup> The word also looks like a <italic>nifal</italic>. However, in this case <italic>ve-nitzaltem</italic> means and ye shall be despoiled, an impossible rendering, for it was Israel that was doing the despoiling. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s note that <italic>ve-nitzaltem</italic> is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>, i.e., active, not passive. Krinsky quotes a reading: It is not possible that its form is that of the <italic>nifal</italic>.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 4</title>
<p>1. AND MOSES ANSWERED. God indicated<sup><xref rid="fn778">1</xref></sup> to Moses that the elders would believe in him.<sup><xref rid="fn779">2</xref></sup> However, He did not mention this explicitly. <italic>And they shall hearken to thy voice</italic> (Ex. 3:18) relates only to behavior and not to inner belief.<sup><xref rid="fn780">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND THE LORD SAID. This sign<sup><xref rid="fn781">4</xref></sup> was not given to Moses so that he would believe, because He had already given him the sign of the bush.<sup><xref rid="fn782">5</xref></sup> God performed this sign for Moses so that Moses would imitate it before the children of Israel. It is therefore written, <italic>that they may believe</italic> (v. 5), which means, thus shall you do before them. God gave Moses a sign via an object that was always with him, the staff, Moses&#x2019; walking stick, as is the custom with elders.<sup><xref rid="fn783">6</xref></sup> Moses would not appear as a shepherd before Pharaoh.<sup><xref rid="fn784">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND HE SAID. Those versed in the sciences ask,<sup><xref rid="fn785">8</xref></sup> how is this possible?<sup><xref rid="fn786">9</xref></sup> They were forced<sup><xref rid="fn787">10</xref></sup> to conclude that it was to remove the dryness.<sup><xref rid="fn788">11</xref></sup> However, all their words are empty wind, as we are dealing with a wondrous event, one that did not occur according to the laws of nature. Yefet says that this wonder was a hint,<sup><xref rid="fn789">12</xref></sup> as Pharaoh was at first soft<sup><xref rid="fn790">13</xref></sup> like a staff and then turned into a serpent. It is written, <italic>Pharaoh King of Egypt, The great serpent</italic><sup><xref rid="fn791">14</xref></sup> (Ezek. 29:3). At the end he ended up the way he started; he was like one that never existed.<sup><xref rid="fn792">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND THE LORD SAID. The first sign was performed upon the staff that was found in Moses&#x2019; hand. The second one was executed on Moses&#x2019; very hand.<sup><xref rid="fn793">16</xref></sup> Yefet says that his hand became leprous because he suspected that the Israelites would not believe him.<sup><xref rid="fn794">17</xref></sup> However, if this were the case,<sup><xref rid="fn795">18</xref></sup> this should have been the first sign.<sup><xref rid="fn796">19</xref></sup> Rabbi Joshua says that this was a hint<sup><xref rid="fn797">20</xref></sup> about Israel, who at first were free and then God plagued them with Egyptian bondage, and that God would eventually heal them and that they would be free once again.</p>
<p>6. AND THE LORD SAID. Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>chek</italic> (bosom) refers to the sleeve of the arm. Similarly <italic>u-ve-cheko yissa</italic> (and carrieth them in his bosom) (Is. 40:11) and <italic>sa&#x2019;ehu ve-chekekha</italic> (carry them in thy bosom) (Num. 11:12).<sup><xref rid="fn798">21</xref></sup> Others say that it refers to a garment that lies close to the chest.</p>
<p>8. AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS. We know that God knew whether they would believe or not. Scripture, however, speaks with regard to Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn799">22</xref></sup> viz., if there will be some Israelites who will not believe the first sign, then they will believe the latter sign (<italic>ha&#x2019;ot ha-acharon</italic>). Scripture speaks of <italic>the voice of the sign</italic>. Now a sign has no voice. The Torah, however, speaks in the language of man,<sup><xref rid="fn800">23</xref></sup> as it does in <italic>Death and life are in the power of the tongue</italic> (Prov. 18:21). Scripture speaks of <italic>the latter sign</italic><sup><xref rid="fn801">24</xref></sup> even though there were three signs, because God now showed only two signs to Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn802">25</xref></sup> as He was yet to perform the third sign.</p>
<p>9. AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS. If there shall still be a few Israelites that will not believe the last sign, then you will show them the third sign and they shall believe. Indeed, it is written, <italic>and</italic> (Moses) <italic>did the signs in the sight of the people</italic> (v. 30). This third sign, namely, <italic>and the water&#x2026;shall become blood upon the dry land</italic> was part of the first of the ten plagues which were destined to come.</p>
<p>10. AND MOSES SAID. All the commentaries agree that <italic>bi</italic> (oh) is to be taken as a supplicatory expression.<sup><xref rid="fn803">26</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi says that <italic>bi</italic> is an abridgement. It is short for <italic>bi ani adoni he-avon</italic> (Upon me, my lord, upon me be the iniquity) (I Sam. 25:24), that is, punish me as you wish<sup><xref rid="fn804">27</xref></sup> but relieve me of this task and do not send me.<sup><xref rid="fn805">28</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>bi adoni yedabber na avdekha davar</italic> (oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord&#x2019;s ears) (Gen. 44:18). Its meaning is, do to me as you wish but allow me to speak.</p>
<p>A MAN OF WORDS. A person who knows how to speak elegantly, that is, a person who does not halt or stutter or have difficulty in enunciating certain letters. It is the custom of the Hebrews when they went to compare two or three things to add the word <italic>gam</italic> (also) to the first object,<sup><xref rid="fn806">29</xref></sup> as in <italic>Rule over us, also you, also your son and also your son&#x2019;s son</italic> (Jud. 8:22).<sup><xref rid="fn807">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>[HERETOFORE.] The explanation of the word <italic>shilshom</italic> (third day)<sup><xref rid="fn808">31</xref></sup> is as follows. The word <italic>temol</italic> (yesterday)<sup><xref rid="fn809">32</xref></sup> refers to the day before the one in which the person is speaking. <italic>Shilshom</italic> thus refers to the third day from which the person is speaking.<sup><xref rid="fn810">33</xref></sup> The <italic>mem</italic> in <italic>shilshom</italic> is the <italic>mem</italic> of the plural<sup><xref rid="fn811">34</xref></sup> as it refers to today and yesterday,<sup><xref rid="fn812">35</xref></sup> even though its <italic>shin</italic> is not vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> as the rules of grammar require.<sup><xref rid="fn813">36</xref></sup> On the other hand, it is possible that the <italic>mem</italic> is appended at the end of the word as it is to the beginning of the word.<sup><xref rid="fn814">37</xref></sup> Compare, the word <italic>mishlosh</italic> (three)<sup><xref rid="fn815">38</xref></sup> in <italic>And it came to pass about three months after</italic> (Gen. 38:24).</p>
<p>NOR SINCE THOU HAST SPOKEN. <italic>Me-az dabberkha</italic> (since thou hast spoken)<sup><xref rid="fn816">39</xref></sup> is to be rendered, from the time that thou hast spoken. <italic>Me-az</italic> (since) in <italic>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name</italic> (Ex. 5:23) is similar, as<sup><xref rid="fn817">40</xref></sup> the slowness of his speech was not removed<sup><xref rid="fn818">41</xref></sup> but remained as it was. The one who says that Moses forgot Egyptian<sup><xref rid="fn819">42</xref></sup> is incorrect, because Moses mentioned two things, viz., slowness of speech and slowness of tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn820">43</xref></sup> Furthermore, we can learn from God&#x2019;s answer, <italic>Who hath made man&#x2019;s mouth? or who maketh a man dumb?</italic> that Moses was not referring to the Egyptian language.<sup><xref rid="fn821">44</xref></sup> The upshot of this is that Moses was born with slowness of speech; i.e., he could not pronounce the labials or all of the linguals.<sup><xref rid="fn822">45</xref></sup> However, he was able to pronounce some of them with difficulty. This is the meaning of, <italic>and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak</italic>; i.e., God told Moses that He would teach him to speak with words that do not contain letters that he had difficulty enunciating.</p>
<p>11. AND THE LORD SAID. We find<sup><xref rid="fn823">46</xref></sup> <italic>dumb</italic> corresponding to the <italic>making of the mouth, blind</italic> corresponding to <italic>seeing</italic>, while the word deaf stands by itself; it has no counterpart. However, in reality the word <italic>pike&#x2019;ach</italic> (seeing) corresponds both to blind and to deaf,<sup><xref rid="fn824">47</xref></sup> as it is written, <italic>pako&#x2019;ach oznayim</italic> (opening the ears) (Is. 42:20); <italic>li-feko&#x2019;ach enayim ivrot</italic> (to open the blind eyes) (Is. 42:7). Behold, God did not now<sup><xref rid="fn825">48</xref></sup> promise Moses that He would remove the slowness of his tongue. He only promised to teach him what to speak.<sup><xref rid="fn826">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND HE SAID. I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn827">50</xref></sup> that the word <italic>na</italic> (I pray) always means now in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn828">51</xref></sup> See, <italic>Speak now</italic> (na) <italic>in the ears of the people</italic> (Ex. 11:2); <italic>Hear now</italic> (na), <italic>O Joshua the high priest</italic> (Zech. 3:8); <italic>Let this man, now</italic> (na)<sup><xref rid="fn829">52</xref></sup> <italic>be put to death</italic> (Jer. 38:4); <italic>Woe now</italic> (na)<sup><xref rid="fn830">53</xref></sup> <italic>unto us&#x0021; for we have sinned</italic> (Lam. 5:16).</p>
<p>WHOM THOU WILT SEND. The word <italic>asher</italic> (whom) has been omitted.<sup><xref rid="fn831">54</xref></sup> Our verse is to be read as if written <italic>be-yad asher tishlach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn832">55</xref></sup> <italic>Im levavam shalem</italic> (whose heart is whole) (II Chron. 16:9) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn833">56</xref></sup> Its meaning is, send this message by the hand of Aaron my brother<sup><xref rid="fn834">57</xref></sup> who is <italic>a man of words</italic>, for he is not of slow speech and he is in the habit of prophesying to Israel. Indeed, it is written in the book of Ezekiel that God sent a prophet to Israel before he sent our master Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn835">58</xref></sup> Scripture also states, <italic>And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the wilderness to meet Moses</italic> (Ex. 4:27).<sup><xref rid="fn836">59</xref></sup> Furthermore, since Aaron was older than Moses, he might be angry if Moses was appointed God&#x2019;s messenger to Pharaoh.<sup><xref rid="fn837">60</xref></sup> It is for this reason that God told Moses, <italic>and when he</italic> (Aaron) <italic>seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart</italic> (Ex. 4:14).<sup><xref rid="fn838">61</xref></sup> Now Moses did not refuse to go.<sup><xref rid="fn839">62</xref></sup> What happened was that Moses first replied, <italic>I am not a man of words</italic> (v. 10), and it is difficult for one who is slow of speech to speak before the king. Moses thought that God<sup><xref rid="fn840">63</xref></sup> would miraculously remove his slowness of speech. However, when God answered him, <italic>and</italic> (I) <italic>will teach thee what thou shalt speak</italic> (v. 12), Moses knew that his slowness of speech would not be removed. Moses thus wondered why God did not send Aaron to Pharaoh. It is for this reason that he said, <italic>send, I pray Thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send</italic>. All of this can be clearly derived from God&#x2019;s answer, <italic>Is not Aaron thy brother&#x2026;</italic> (v. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn841">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED. Heaven forbid that this be the meaning of the verse, <italic>that the Lord&#x2026;sought to kill him</italic> (v. 24),<sup><xref rid="fn842">65</xref></sup> as he should have killed him now when he refused to go, not when he went, as others have interpreted. Why kill him when he went?<sup><xref rid="fn843">66</xref></sup> Our case cannot be compared to that of Balaam.<sup><xref rid="fn844">67</xref></sup> Similarly, the incident with Jacob is different.<sup><xref rid="fn845">68</xref></sup> Should someone argue, where do we find a case where God&#x2019;s anger did not cause harm,<sup><xref rid="fn846">69</xref></sup> we will show him, <italic>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them</italic> (Num. 12:9),<sup><xref rid="fn847">70</xref></sup> yet no harm befell Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn848">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture refers to Aaron as <italic>the Levite</italic>, for this is the way the Levite prophet<sup><xref rid="fn849">72</xref></sup> was known in Israel since there were others who bore this name.<sup><xref rid="fn850">73</xref></sup> Now Aaron&#x2019;s appointment as spokesman<sup><xref rid="fn851">74</xref></sup> did not entail Moses&#x2019; demotion. On the contrary, Moses&#x2019; status was thereby elevated. Aaron was merely an instrument, similar to the mouth which brings forth the words of the invisible soul which, like the angels, cannot be seen because they are incorporeal. Moses&#x2019; station was thus similar to the station of an angel.<sup><xref rid="fn852">75</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>And thou shalt be to him in Elohim&#x2019;s</italic> (God&#x2019;s)<sup><xref rid="fn853">76</xref></sup><italic>stead</italic> (v. 16). Now <italic>Elohim</italic> in Scripture does not refer to anything but God the glorious or His holy angels<sup><xref rid="fn854">77</xref></sup> or the holy ones below who execute God&#x2019;s justice in the world.<sup><xref rid="fn855">78</xref></sup> Whenever Scripture refers to an idol by the term <italic>elohim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn856">79</xref></sup> it does so in keeping with the beliefs of its worshippers.<sup><xref rid="fn857">80</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>unto the prophet Hananiah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn858">81</xref></sup> (Jer. 28:5).</p>
<p>17. AND&#x2026;THIS ROD. Scripture refers to <italic>the signs</italic><sup><xref rid="fn859">82</xref></sup> because the rod changed into a serpent before all of Israel and into a serpent before Pharaoh. The rod was also used to strike the Nile, to bring up frogs, to produce gnats, to bring down hail, to bring locusts, and to cause darkness.<sup><xref rid="fn860">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND MOSES WENT&#x2026;JETHER.<sup><xref rid="fn861">84</xref></sup> Jether and Jethro are one and the same. Similarly, <italic>Geshem</italic> (Neh. 6:2) and <italic>Gashmu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn862">85</xref></sup> (Neh. 6:6) are one and the same, as are <italic>Salmah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn863">86</xref></sup> (Ruth 4:20) and <italic>Salmon</italic> (Ruth 4:21). Moses told Jethro that he was going to see his brethren. He did not reveal the secret to him.<sup><xref rid="fn864">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND THE LORD SAID. The Torah is not<sup><xref rid="fn865">88</xref></sup> in chronological order.<sup><xref rid="fn866">89</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>and the Lord said</italic> is, and the Lord had said.<sup><xref rid="fn867">90</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>And out of the ground made the Lord to grow</italic><sup><xref rid="fn868">91</xref></sup> (Gen. 2:9) and many other such instances. Now when Moses was handing over Jethro&#x2019;s sheep to Jethro, God assured him that he could go to Egypt without trepidation because Pharaoh and his servants who knew about the incident of the Egyptian were dead. This is the meaning of <italic>that the king of Egypt died</italic> (Ex. 2:23); as long as Pharaoh lived it was improper for Moses to be a messenger to him.<sup><xref rid="fn869">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND MOSES TOOK. We do not know whether Gershom was born at the time that Moses was a young man, when he fled to Midian, or during his old age. Do not rely on <italic>The History of Moses</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn870">93</xref></sup> as everything written in it is nonsense. Moses&#x2019; second son, namely, Eliezer, was born now, at the time that Moses started to prophesy. Moses planned to bring his wife and sons to Egypt so that they could leave Egypt together with all of Israel. However, this was not a good idea; he was going to bring the Israelites out of Egypt and they would see that he came with his wife and children to live there.<sup><xref rid="fn871">94</xref></sup> Do not be surprised that a prophet should incorrectly assess practical events,<sup><xref rid="fn872">95</xref></sup> for indeed we find that David asked Nathan the prophet whether is was proper for him to build a temple to the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn873">96</xref></sup> Nathan then answered him, <italic>All that is in thy heart do, for the Lord is with thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn874">97</xref></sup> However, in a prophetic vision of the night, Nathan was told to inform David that he should not build the temple.<sup><xref rid="fn875">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>The elders<sup><xref rid="fn876">99</xref></sup> were forced to translate <italic>upon an ass</italic> as upon the man carrier, because it is demeaning that the wife of the prophet and her two sons should ride on one ass.<sup><xref rid="fn877">100</xref></sup> Yefet<sup><xref rid="fn878">101</xref></sup> says that <italic>ass</italic> is used as a collective noun,<sup><xref rid="fn879">102</xref></sup> as in <italic>And I have an ox and an ass</italic> (Gen. 32:6).<sup><xref rid="fn880">103</xref></sup> However, Yefet is incorrect. This is not the place to use collective nouns.<sup><xref rid="fn881">104</xref></sup> The term<sup><xref rid="fn882">105</xref></sup> thus must be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn883">106</xref></sup> Now the asses in Egypt are dearer and more precious than the mules.<sup><xref rid="fn884">107</xref></sup> There is nothing to wonder about<sup><xref rid="fn885">108</xref></sup> if his son Gershom rode behind his mother. Perhaps he was small<sup><xref rid="fn886">109</xref></sup> and Eliezer was in her bosom for he was not yet circumcised.</p>
<p>[AND HE RETURNED TO THE LAND OF EGYPT.] Its meaning is that only Moses himself returned.<sup><xref rid="fn887">110</xref></sup> When God met Moses (v. 24) Eliezer was circumcised (v. 25). When Eliezer was healed, Zipporah and her children returned to her father. Moses left them and went on to Egypt.</p>
<p>Scripture refers to the staff as <italic>the rod of God</italic> because of the sign that was performed with it.<sup><xref rid="fn888">111</xref></sup> The rod of God is the same as the rod of Moses and the rod of Aaron. It was in his<sup><xref rid="fn889">112</xref></sup> hand when he did the signs.<sup><xref rid="fn890">113</xref></sup> Now that the rod of God is mentioned Scripture backtracks and relates that God told Moses<sup><xref rid="fn891">114</xref></sup> all the wonders that he was destined to do in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn892">115</xref></sup> He mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn893">116</xref></sup> to Moses the sign that would bring Israel out of Egypt, namely, the plague of the first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn894">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>[24. AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE WAY AT THE LODGING-PLACE.] This should have been connected to <italic>And Moses took his wife and his sons</italic> (v. 20).<sup><xref rid="fn895">118</xref></sup> There are many such cases in the Pentateuch, an example being, <italic>he shall make restitution</italic> (Ex. 22:2). The latter is connected to <italic>he shall pay five oxen for an ox</italic> (Ex. 21:37).<sup><xref rid="fn896">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THE LORD SAID. This was told to Moses in Midian.<sup><xref rid="fn897">120</xref></sup> God informed Moses that He would harden Pharaoh&#x2019;s heart and that Pharaoh would not let them go despite all of the wonders, including the last one,<sup><xref rid="fn898">121</xref></sup> that He would show them.<sup><xref rid="fn899">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND THOU SHALT SAY. The meaning of <italic>Israel is My son, My first-born</italic><sup><xref rid="fn900">123</xref></sup> is: the ancestors of this nation were the first to serve Me. I therefore take pity on this nation as a father pities a son who serves him. You took him for a perpetual slave. I will therefore kill your first-born son.</p>
<p>23. AND I HAVE SAID UNTO THEE. Behold, I have told you time and time again to let My son go, that he may serve Me by offering sacrifices to Me, and thou hast refused to let him go. I will therefore punish thee.<sup><xref rid="fn901">124</xref></sup> The ignorant say that these words are directed at Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn902">125</xref></sup> The latter is sheer madness. Furthermore, Eliezer<sup><xref rid="fn903">126</xref></sup> was not Moses&#x2019; first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn904">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE WAY. They had a tradition that a child should not be circumcised on the eighth day if he was sick, or while traveling when it was not possible for his guardian to tarry and circumcise him. Now because Moses could not tarry in carrying out God&#x2019;s mission he concluded that he should not circumcise his son, because the child would be in danger if he were taken along.<sup><xref rid="fn905">128</xref></sup> God therefore sent an angel<sup><xref rid="fn906">129</xref></sup> to tell Moses to put his decision aside<sup><xref rid="fn907">130</xref></sup> and to circumcise the lad. The child would then remain with his mother until healed and Moses would continue on by himself.</p>
<p>[THAT THE LORD MET HIM.] Its meaning is that God sent an illness upon Moses because it did not occur to him.<sup><xref rid="fn908">131</xref></sup> This then is the meaning of <italic>and sought to slay him</italic>: God sought to slay Moses if he would not circumcise his son. Now because Moses was seized with trembling<sup><xref rid="fn909">132</xref></sup> he could not circumcise his son. Zipporah circumcised him, for Moses revealed this secret to her.<sup><xref rid="fn910">133</xref></sup> Do not be surprised that it is written, <italic>That the Lord met him</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn911">134</xref></sup> the reference is to an angel of the Lord. <italic>And the Lord went before them</italic> (Ex. 13:21) is similar, and there it is written, <italic>And the angel of God&#x2026;removed</italic> (Ex. 14:19). However, Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni<sup><xref rid="fn912">135</xref></sup> says: Perish the thought that God would seek to slay Moses who was on God&#x2019;s mission to redeem His people. It was rather Eliezer whom the Lord sought to slay, and it is to Eliezer that the third person pronominal suffixes of <italic>va-yifgeshehu</italic> (met him) and <italic>hamito</italic> (slay him) refer. Scripture then goes on to explain that the reference is to Eliezer.<sup><xref rid="fn913">136</xref></sup> Scripture therefore states, <italic>and cut off the foreskin of her son</italic>. He is not at first mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn914">137</xref></sup> because he did not as yet have a name. <italic>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand</italic> (Gen. 38:28) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn915">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. THEN ZIPPORAH TOOK A FLINT. A sharp instrument.<sup><xref rid="fn916">139</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Make thee knives of flint</italic><sup><xref rid="fn917">140</xref></sup> (Josh. 5:2) which refers to sharp knives. <italic>Yea, thou turnest back the flint</italic> (tzur) <italic>of his sword</italic><sup><xref rid="fn918">141</xref></sup> (Ps. 89:44) is similar.</p>
<p>[AND CAST IT AT HIS FEET.] In my opinion the reference is to Moses&#x2019; feet. Our verse is like<sup><xref rid="fn919">142</xref></sup> <italic>and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel, and upon the side-posts, the Lord&#x2026;will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to destroy you</italic> (Ex. 12:23). Therefore<sup><xref rid="fn920">143</xref></sup> <italic>He let him</italic>, that is, Moses, <italic>alone;</italic> his illness and shivering ceased. However, Rabbi Samuel<sup><xref rid="fn921">144</xref></sup> says that <italic>his feet</italic> refers to Eliezer&#x2019;s feet,<sup><xref rid="fn922">145</xref></sup> and similarly <italic>He let him alone</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn923">146</xref></sup> This being the case we can refute him by asking, &#x201C;If the illness befell Eliezer how could Zipporah circumcise him, thereby adding pain to his pain?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn924">147</xref></sup></p>
<p>[A BRIDEGROOM OF BLOOD.] It is the custom of women to refer to a child as a bridegroom when he is circumcised.</p>
<p>[BLOOD.] Its meaning is, <italic>surely thou art a man of blood to me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn925">148</xref></sup> for because of you my husband will die.</p>
<p>26. SO HE LET HIM ALONE. The word <italic>damim</italic> (blood) in Hebrew is used in two ways. One way is to indicate bloodshed, as in <italic>because thou art a man of blood to me</italic> (II Sam. 16:8).<sup><xref rid="fn926">149</xref></sup> The person who says that <italic>damim</italic> refers to life<sup><xref rid="fn927">150</xref></sup> is giving the word a meaning that it does not have. The second way<sup><xref rid="fn928">151</xref></sup> is as a plural referring to actual blood,<sup><xref rid="fn929">152</xref></sup> as in <italic>be-damayikh chayi</italic> (in thy blood live) (Ezek. 16:6). Now when Zipporah saw that the illness left Moses she exclaimed, you my son are not a bridegroom of blood, blood referring to death,<sup><xref rid="fn930">153</xref></sup> but you are a bridegroom wallowing in the blood of circumcision. The word <italic>mulot</italic> (circumcision) is a noun. It is in the plural<sup><xref rid="fn931">154</xref></sup> because of <italic>damim</italic> (blood).<sup><xref rid="fn932">155</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND THE LORD SAID TO AARON. Aaron did not prophesy;<sup><xref rid="fn933">156</xref></sup> there was no need for him to do so<sup><xref rid="fn934">157</xref></sup> as Moses was the messenger sent to Pharaoh. However, prior to this Aaron had been sent as messenger to the male Israelites, and Miriam to the females. The prophet therefore says, <italic>And I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam</italic> (Micah 6:4).</p>
<p>IN THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD. The reference is to Mount Horeb.</p>
<p>28. AND MOSES TOLD. God sent Moses to Israel first.<sup><xref rid="fn935">158</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ALL THE SIGNS WHEREWITH HE HAD CHARGED HIM. To first perform before Israel and then to perform other signs before Pharaoh.<sup><xref rid="fn936">159</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND MOSES AND AARON WENT. <italic>The elders</italic> are the counselors in each generation,<sup><xref rid="fn937">160</xref></sup> as Moses and Aaron could not possibly speak to six hundred thousand men. It was rather the elders who spoke to them.</p>
<p>30. AND AARON SPOKE. For he was Moses&#x2019; mouthpiece.<sup><xref rid="fn938">161</xref></sup> Moses therefore never spoke to Israel except through Aaron. When Aaron died his son Eleazar took his place and similarly became Moses&#x2019; mouthpiece.</p>
<p>31. AND THE PEOPLE BELIEVED. After they heard that the Lord had remembered his people. The end of the time period that had been told to Abraham had come.<sup><xref rid="fn939">162</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEIR AFFLICTION. <italic>Onyam</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>inuy</italic> (affliction).<sup><xref rid="fn940">163</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEN THEY BOWED. <italic>Va-yikkedu</italic> (then they bowed) comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn941">164</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>kodkod</italic> (skull).<sup><xref rid="fn942">165</xref></sup> <italic>Va-yikkedu</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>va-yittemu</italic> (were ended)<sup><xref rid="fn943">166</xref></sup> in <italic>so the days of weeping in the mourning of Moses were ended</italic> (Deut. 34:8) and <italic>yiddemu</italic> (they are still)<sup><xref rid="fn944">167</xref></sup> in <italic>they are as still as stone</italic> (Ex. 16:16). If only those who say that these words<sup><xref rid="fn945">168</xref></sup> come from roots that begin with a <italic>nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn946">169</xref></sup> would be <italic>as still as stone</italic>. In order to explain the paradigm<sup><xref rid="fn947">170</xref></sup> they add roots that are nonexistent in the holy tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn948">171</xref></sup> Can they not see that the word <italic>redu</italic> (get you down)<sup><xref rid="fn949">172</xref></sup> (Gen. 42:2) follows the paradigm of <italic>benu</italic> (build ye)<sup><xref rid="fn950">173</xref></sup> in <italic>Build ye</italic> (lakhem) <italic>houses</italic> (Jer. 29:5)<sup><xref rid="fn951">174</xref></sup> although they are two different<sup><xref rid="fn952">175</xref></sup> roots.<sup><xref rid="fn953">176</xref></sup> The correct thing is to do everything in our power not to multiply roots because of paradigms.</p>
<ftnote id="fn778"><sup>1</sup> Literally, told.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn779"><sup>2</sup> I.E. was bothered by the following: since God told Moses, <italic>And they shall hearken to thy voice</italic> (Ex. 3:18) why did Moses now say, <italic>But, behold, they will not believe me</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn780"><sup>3</sup> Thus God never actually told Moses that he would be believed. It should be noted that Nahmanides had a different reading of I.E. According to Nahmanides, I.E. offers two answers to the question raised (see note 2). God told Moses that the elders would believe. He did not tell him that the people would believe. <italic>And they shall hearken to thy voice</italic> only relates to behavior, not to inner belief.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn781"><sup>4</sup> The staff becoming a serpent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn782"><sup>5</sup> The burning bush convinced Moses of the truth of his mission.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn783"><sup>6</sup> Moses was then 80 years old and walked with a staff (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn784"><sup>7</sup> Thus the staff in his hand was not a shepherd&#x2019;s staff but the staff of an elder.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn785"><sup>8</sup> In Hebrew, <italic>chakhme ha-mechkar</italic> (philosophers professing materialistic principles) (Friedlander).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn786"><sup>9</sup> For a staff to be turned into a serpent by being cast upon the ground.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn787"><sup>10</sup> To conclude by their philosophic inquiries.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn788"><sup>11</sup> The dry wood of the staff became moist by coming into contact with the ground. It was then fit for life to enter it (Zarza). This explanation of course appears ridiculous to a modern person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn789"><sup>12</sup> About Pharaoh. It explained Pharaoh&#x2019;s nature.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn790"><sup>13</sup> By soft, I.E. means an object not inherently evil. Pharaoh at first did not oppress the Israelites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn791"><sup>14</sup> Hebrew <italic>tannim</italic>. J.P.S. translates it as dragon. However, Yefet rendered it as serpent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn792"><sup>15</sup> Like the serpent which turned back to a staff. Pharaoh the serpent of the Nile was defanged and broken like a dry stick.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn793"><sup>16</sup> Which became leprous. This raises a question: Leprosy is usually a sign of punishment. (Cf. Num. 12:10; II Chron. 26:20.) This being the case, why was Moses punished?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn794"><sup>17</sup> So too the sages of the Talmud and Midrash. Cf. <italic>Sabbath</italic> 57a; <italic>Shemot Rabba</italic> 3:12. Similarly Rashi. It is hard to understand why I.E. would quote a Karaite when he had traditional sources at his disposal that said the same thing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn795"><sup>18</sup> That Moses was being punished.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn796"><sup>19</sup> First Moses should have been punished by having his hand turned leprous and then shown the sign of the staff turning into a serpent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn797"><sup>20</sup> In other words, Moses was not being punished.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn798"><sup>21</sup> According to Saadiah Gaon <italic>ve-cheko</italic> means in his sleeve and <italic>ve-chekekha</italic> in your sleeve.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn799"><sup>22</sup> Moses did not know how many signs he would have to do before all the people would believe him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn800"><sup>23</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 1:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn801"><sup>24</sup> Scripture refers to the second sign as the latter sign (<italic>ha&#x2019;ot ha-acharon</italic>). However, in view of the fact that there were three signs, Scripture should have referred to it as the second sign.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn802"><sup>25</sup> The second sign was thus the latter sign at that moment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn803"><sup>26</sup> It means please or pray.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn804"><sup>27</sup> I.E. explains <italic>avon</italic> (iniquity) to mean punishment. See his comments on Gen. 4:13 and 43:20. Thus <italic>bi ani adoni he-avon</italic> means upon me, my lord be, the punishment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn805"><sup>28</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s elaboration of the implication of <italic>bi ani adoni he-avon</italic> in the context in which it is used in this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn806"><sup>29</sup> Our text reads, <italic>gam mi-temol gam mi-shilshom</italic> (neither heretofore), <italic>gam me-az dabberekha el avdekha</italic> (nor since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant). Literally translated, it means: also from yesterday and also from the third day, also since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant. The first &#x201C;also&#x201D; appears out of place hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. I.E. then goes on to explain what Scripture means by the third day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn807"><sup>30</sup> This is the literal rendition of the verse. J.P.S. translates somewhat differently.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn808"><sup>31</sup> J.P.S. heretofore. See note 29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn809"><sup>32</sup> J.P.S. heretofore. See note 29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn810"><sup>33</sup> Hence <italic>shilshom</italic> (the third day) means three days ago. The point is that the Bible uses <italic>temol</italic> and <italic>shilshom</italic> back to back. Since <italic>temol</italic> means yesterday the word <italic>shilshom</italic> must mean three says ago, not the third day to come.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn811"><sup>34</sup> The masculine pronominal plural suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn812"><sup>35</sup> That is, <italic>shilshom</italic> means their third day, i.e., today&#x2019;s and yesterday&#x2019;s third day (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn813"><sup>36</sup> If the meaning of <italic>shilshom</italic> is their third day (<italic>shalosh she-lahem</italic>) the word should have read <italic>shilsham</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn814"><sup>37</sup> That is, the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>shilshom</italic> is not the <italic>mem</italic> of the plural. It is a form (or superfluous) letter and has no meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn815"><sup>38</sup> The <italic>mem</italic> in <italic>mishlosh</italic> has no meaning. See I.E. on Gen. 35:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn816"><sup>39</sup> The word <italic>az</italic> means then. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that <italic>me-az</italic> means from the time or since.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn817"><sup>40</sup> The reason that Moses said what is recorded in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn818"><sup>41</sup> By God when He revealed Himself to Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn819"><sup>42</sup> This commentator explains that slowness of speech and tongue refers not to a speech impediment but rather to Moses&#x2019; inability to speak Egyptian. The latter interpretation is offered by Rashbam.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn820"><sup>43</sup> If the reference was merely to difficulty in speaking Egyptian, Moses would have limited himself to slowness of speech.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn821"><sup>44</sup> God appears to be addressing a complaint about a physical impediment rather than one dealing with a lack of knowledge.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn822"><sup>45</sup> Slowness of speech indicates a problem with labials, for the Hebrew word for speech is <italic>safah</italic> (lips). Slowness of tongue indicates a problem with linguals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn823"><sup>46</sup> In our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn824"><sup>47</sup> It comes from the root <italic>peh, kof, chet</italic>, which means to open. Thus <italic>pike&#x2019;ach</italic> can refer to one who can either hear or see.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn825"><sup>48</sup> As our verse may be taken to imply.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn826"><sup>49</sup> See verse 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn827"><sup>50</sup> Gen. 12:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn828"><sup>51</sup> Hence <italic>shlach na</italic> (send, I pray) means send now.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn829"><sup>52</sup> Translated according to I.E. J.P.S. translates as, <italic>We pray thee</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn830"><sup>53</sup> Translated according to I.E. J.P.S. translation reads, <italic>Woe unto us;</italic> i.e., it does not translates <italic>na</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn831"><sup>54</sup> From the clause <italic>shelach na be-yad tishlach</italic> (send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send). Its literal meaning is: send, I pray Thee (or now) by the hand of Thou wilt send, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that the word <italic>asher</italic> (whom, i.e., he whom) has to be added to the text. The word <italic>asher</italic> can mean which, that, who, or in order to.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn832"><sup>55</sup> Which means via the hand of him whom you were in the habit of sending, i.e., Aaron. Rashi interprets similarly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn833"><sup>56</sup> The word <italic>asher</italic> has to be added to the clause which is to be read as if written, <italic>asher im levavam shalem</italic> (of them whose heart is whole).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn834"><sup>57</sup> Literally, Aaron his brother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn835"><sup>58</sup> See Ezek. 20:5. I.E. identifies this prophet with Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn836"><sup>59</sup> Which shows that Aaron was a prophet, as God spoke to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn837"><sup>60</sup> Hence Moses suggested that God appoint Aaron to this task.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn838"><sup>61</sup> That is, Aaron is not angry that you, his younger brother, have been chosen as God&#x2019;s messenger.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn839"><sup>62</sup> As God&#x2019;s messenger, as a superficial reading of verses 10-14 implies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn840"><sup>63</sup> In response to Moses&#x2019; reply, <italic>I am not a man of words</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn841"><sup>64</sup> <italic>Is not Aaron thy brother</italic> implies that Moses suggested that Aaron be chosen in his place. <italic>When he</italic> (Aaron) <italic>seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart</italic> implies that Aaron is not angry for not being chosen. <italic>He</italic> (Aaron) <italic>can speak well</italic> implies that Moses was concerned with not being able to speak before the king.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn842"><sup>65</sup> That is, God sought to slay Moses (v. 24) because he at first refused the Lord&#x2019;s call to be His messenger. See Rashbam on verse 24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn843"><sup>66</sup> Verse 24 describes what happened to Moses on his way to Egypt as God&#x2019;s messenger.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn844"><sup>67</sup> Where God told Balaam that he may go to Balak (Num. 22:20) and then sent an angel with a drawn sword to stop him (Num. 22:22), for Balaam had evil intentions (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn845"><sup>68</sup> Gen. 32:25 tells us that an angel tried to kill Jacob. However, that incident too cannot be compared to that of Balaam, for that angel was not sent to punish Jacob. So Filwarg. For other interpretations see Krinsky and Weiser. However, their interpretations are forced.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn846"><sup>69</sup> That is, once the <italic>anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses</italic> punishment had to follow. The only punishment that conceivably followed was <italic>that the Lord sought to kill him</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn847"><sup>70</sup> Against Aaron and Miriam.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn848"><sup>71</sup> Thus punishment does not always follow the kindling of God&#x2019;s anger.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn849"><sup>72</sup> That is, Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn850"><sup>73</sup> There were other people who bore the name Aaron. Hence people referred to the Aaron who was the prophet as Aaron the Levite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn851"><sup>74</sup> Literally, this thing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn852"><sup>75</sup> Moses was the &#x201C;soul&#x201D; of the words produced by Aaron. The soul is angelic; hence Moses was angelic.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn853"><sup>76</sup> That is, you will be as an angel to Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn854"><sup>77</sup> As in verse 16. Also see I.E. on Gen. 1:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn855"><sup>78</sup> Judges. See I.E. on Gen. 1:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn856"><sup>79</sup> Which seems to indicate that <italic>elohim</italic> also means an idol. However, I.E. has just stated that it refers only to God, angels, and judges.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn857"><sup>80</sup> Thus even when <italic>elohim</italic> refers to an idol it means a god.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn858"><sup>81</sup> Who was not a true prophet, yet was called one.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn859"><sup>82</sup> Scripture speaks of this rod, <italic>wherewith thou shalt do the signs</italic>. However, up to now Scripture speaks of only one sign that was to be done with the rod, i.e., its being changed into a serpent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn860"><sup>83</sup> Many other signs were to be done with the rod in the future. Hence Scripture speaks of <italic>the signs</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn861"><sup>84</sup> This is the Hebrew reading. J.P.S. translates it as Jethro.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn862"><sup>85</sup> This is the Hebrew reading. J.P.S. translates it as Geshem.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn863"><sup>86</sup> This is the Hebrew reading. J.P.S. translates it as Salmon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn864"><sup>87</sup> That he was going at God&#x2019;s command to liberate them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn865"><sup>88</sup> Always.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn866"><sup>89</sup> What is reported in verse 19 had to take place before what is recorded in verse 18. It is illogical for Moses to have told Jethro that he was going to Egypt before being informed by the Lord that Pharaoh was dead.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn867"><sup>90</sup> For the reasons noted in note 89 we must translate verse 19 as: and the Lord had said to Moses in Midian (i.e., before Moses had taken leave of Jethro), <italic>Go return into Egypt</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn868"><sup>91</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 2:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn869"><sup>92</sup> The same Pharaoh who knew of the incident of the Egyptian.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn870"><sup>93</sup> A medieval work dealing with the life of Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn871"><sup>94</sup> Hence the Israelites would have reason to doubt whether they were really going to be brought out of Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn872"><sup>95</sup> That is, do not be surprised that a prophet can err as Moses did in wanting to bring his family to Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn873"><sup>96</sup> This is the import of II Sam. 7:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn874"><sup>97</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s slight paraphrase of II Sam. 7:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn875"><sup>98</sup> II Sam. 7:5-13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn876"><sup>99</sup> Who translated the Pentateuch into Greek. See <italic>Megillah</italic> 9a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn877"><sup>100</sup> For this implies that Moses was impoverished.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn878"><sup>101</sup> See notes and comments on Ex. 3:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn879"><sup>102</sup> Thus more than one ass was used by Moses&#x2019; family. Therefore the verse does not imply that Moses was impoverished.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn880"><sup>103</sup> The meaning of which is: And I have oxen and asses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn881"><sup>104</sup> One uses the collective noun when one speaks of many of a kind. Here, at most two asses were involved and the use of the collective is out of place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn882"><sup>105</sup> Ass.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn883"><sup>106</sup> It refers to one ass.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn884"><sup>107</sup> Hence Moses chose an ass rather than a mule for his family to ride upon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn885"><sup>108</sup> Why Moses employed one ass for his family. His wife rode holding their infant son Eliezer and their other son rode behind her as children are wont to do.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn886"><sup>109</sup> Young. See the opening of I.E.&#x2019;s comment. This would make the scenario more acceptable, and not be demeaning to Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn887"><sup>110</sup> The verse reads, <italic>And Moses took his wife and his sons&#x2026;and <span class="underline">he </span>returned to Egypt</italic>. Hence I.E&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn888"><sup>111</sup> Ex. 4:1-4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn889"><sup>112</sup> Aaron&#x2019;s (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn890"><sup>113</sup> When Aaron performed signs he held the rod. Hence it is also referred to as the rod of Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn891"><sup>114</sup> In general terms.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn892"><sup>115</sup> Verse 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn893"><sup>116</sup> That is, he specifically mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn894"><sup>117</sup> Verse 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn895"><sup>118</sup> The sequence of events is: And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on an ass. And it came to pass on the way at the lodging place, etc. That which is between these verses is parenthetical.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn896"><sup>119</sup> And not that which immediately precedes it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn897"><sup>120</sup> When God told Moses, <italic>Go return into Egypt</italic> (v. 19) (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn898"><sup>121</sup> The plague of the first-born. Even after this plague Pharaoh changed his mind and tried to re-enslave the Israelites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn899"><sup>122</sup> Nahmanide&#x2019;s version of I.E. had, &#x201C;God informed Moses that he would harden Pharaoh&#x2019;s heart and that Pharaoh would not let them go despite the wonders until He would show (them) the last wonder.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn900"><sup>123</sup> And what follows, i.e., verse 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn901"><sup>124</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of verse 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn902"><sup>125</sup> Moses refused to go to Egypt to liberate God&#x2019;s first-born son (Israel). God therefore threatened to kill Moses&#x2019; son. This explains the sequence which follows in verse 24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn903"><sup>126</sup> The son of Moses that God wanted to kill (v. 24).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn904"><sup>127</sup> If God wanted to kill Moses&#x2019; first-born because Moses did not have pity on His first-born, then Gershom should have been threatened.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn905"><sup>128</sup> After circumcising him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn906"><sup>129</sup> This is the meaning of <italic>that the Lord met him</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn907"><sup>130</sup> Not to circumcise Eliezer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn908"><sup>131</sup> To circumcise his son at that time. I.E. literally reads: Its meaning is, an illness came upon Moses from God that he did not think.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn909"><sup>132</sup> He was shivering due to the illness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn910"><sup>133</sup> That he was ill because he did not circumcise his son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn911"><sup>134</sup> I.E. explains that God sent an angel to tell Moses to desist from his decision. However, the verse implies that it was God Himself who met Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn912"><sup>135</sup> The last Gaon of Sura. He died in 1034 C.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn913"><sup>136</sup> That is, to her son. The name Eliezer is not used in our passage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn914"><sup>137</sup> Scripture refers to Eliezer by the term <italic>him</italic>. However, before referring to a person in the third person, one has to first identify him. I.E. thus explains that Scripture does not identify the object of <italic>va-yifgeshehu</italic> and <italic>hamito</italic> because he did not yet have a name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn915"><sup>138</sup> Scripture does not identify the one that put out his hand because he was not yet named.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn916"><sup>139</sup> According to I.E. the word <italic>tsor</italic> (flint) is not to be translated as flint but as something sharp and hard as a flint, that is, a sharp instrument.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn918"><sup>141</sup> J.P.S. translates as <italic>edge of his sword</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn919"><sup>142</sup> That is, the placing of the bloody foreskin on Moses&#x2019; feet was similar to the placing of the blood on the side-posts and lintels of the Israelite homes; i.e., it prevented the destroyer from killing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn920"><sup>143</sup> Because of what Zipporah did.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn921"><sup>144</sup> Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn922"><sup>145</sup> Rabbi Samuel&#x2019;s comment is in keeping with his interpretation that it was Eliezer rather than Moses who took ill.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn923"><sup>146</sup> The reference is again to Eliezer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn924"><sup>147</sup> The idea is that it would be either dangerous or cruel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn925"><sup>148</sup> Cf. II Sam. 16:8, <italic>because</italic> (surely) <italic>thou art a man of blood</italic>. Thus <italic>blood</italic> means bloody.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn927"><sup>150</sup> This commentary takes blood to mean life because a living person has blood flowing through him. According to this commentary, <italic>Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me</italic> means: Surely a live bridegroom are thou (Moses) to me; i.e., thou art alive because I circumcised Eliezer. Similarly the word <italic>blood</italic> in the next verse. It should be noted that in Ex. 22:2 Rashi explains <italic>dam</italic> (blood) as alive and I.E. takes issue with him there (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn928"><sup>151</sup> That the word <italic>damim</italic> is used.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn932"><sup>155</sup> <italic>Damim</italic> which precedes <italic>mulot</italic> is in the plural; i.e., the word <italic>mulot</italic> is in the plural because it follows <italic>damim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn933"><sup>156</sup> God told Aaron, <italic>Go into the wilderness to meet Moses</italic>. He did not tell him to prophesy before Pharaoh (Weiser).</ftnote>

<p>1. AND AFTERWARD. After Aaron did the signs<sup><xref rid="fn954">1</xref></sup> the two of them came to Pharaoh and the two of them spoke.<sup><xref rid="fn955">2</xref></sup> For the Lord had promised them, <italic>and I will be with thy mouth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn956">3</xref></sup> <italic>and with his mouth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn957">4</xref></sup> (Ex. 4:15).</p>
<p>AND SAID&#x2026;THUS SAITH THE LORD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL. Pharaoh had never before heard this name.<sup><xref rid="fn958">5</xref></sup> Moses therefore added <italic>the God of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn959">6</xref></sup> the meaning of which is, the people of Israel and not only the patriarch Jacob.</p>
<p>THAT THEY MAY HOLD A FEAST (<italic>VE-YACHOGU</italic>) UNTO ME IN THE WILDERNESS. That they may sacrifice unto me.<sup><xref rid="fn960">7</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>bind the offering</italic> (chag) <italic>to the horns of the altar with cords</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn961">8</xref></sup> and <italic>chaggim</italic> (offerings) in <italic>Let the offerings come round</italic> (Is. 29:1).<sup><xref rid="fn962">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND PHARAOH SAID: WHO IS THE LORD, THAT I SHOULD HEARKEN UNTO HIS VOICE. He asked, &#x201C;Who is the Lord that he is God?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn963">10</xref></sup> We learn this from Moses&#x2019; answer to Pharaoh, which follows.<sup><xref rid="fn964">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND THEY SAID. This name<sup><xref rid="fn965">12</xref></sup> refers to the God of the Hebrews. The Hebrews were a group whom the Egyptians were familiar with.<sup><xref rid="fn966">13</xref></sup> The term Hebrew refers to Abraham, who is called the Hebrew.<sup><xref rid="fn967">14</xref></sup> It likewise refers to Abraham&#x2019;s son Isaac and to Jacob and his sons,<sup><xref rid="fn968">15</xref></sup> as I will explain when I comment on the verse <italic>if thou buy a Hebrew servant</italic> (Ex. 21:2).</p>
<p>AND THEY SAID. The word <italic>nikra</italic> (hath met) is similar to <italic>nikro nikreti</italic> (as I happened by chance)<sup><xref rid="fn969">16</xref></sup> in <italic>As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa</italic> (II Sam. 1:6). It means met. He explained to Pharaoh why they are obligated to offer sacrifices, i.e., lest a pestilence or sword come upon us.<sup><xref rid="fn970">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>LEST HE FALL UPON US. <italic>Upon us</italic> includes us Israelites, also you, Pharaoh, and all the Egyptians.</p>
<p>When Pharaoh saw that swarms of animals came and devoured many Egyptians, as it is written, <italic>He sent among them swarms of animals, which devoured them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn971">18</xref></sup> (Ps. 78:45), he said, <italic>Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land</italic> (Ex. 8:21).<sup><xref rid="fn972">19</xref></sup> However, Moses answered him, <italic>it is not meet so to do</italic> in the land<sup><xref rid="fn973">20</xref></sup> (Ps. 8:22). On the contrary, they would go a distance of three days&#x2019; journey into the wilderness (Ps. 8:23).<sup><xref rid="fn974">21</xref></sup> The latter is the distance between Egypt and Mount Sinai for one who takes a straight path. It was there<sup><xref rid="fn975">22</xref></sup> that the Israelites offered sacrifices, as it is written, <italic>ye shall serve God upon this mountain</italic> (Ex. 3:12).<sup><xref rid="fn976">23</xref></sup> It is furthermore written, <italic>and Moses</italic><sup><xref rid="fn977">24</xref></sup> <italic>builded an altar under the mount</italic> (Ex. 24:4). Also, the altar that Moses built after Amalek was defeated<sup><xref rid="fn978">25</xref></sup> was erected on Mount Sinai, as it is written, <italic>and</italic> (Israel) <italic>encamped in Rephidim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn979">26</xref></sup> (Ex. 17:1), and it is there written, <italic>Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb</italic><sup><xref rid="fn980">27</xref></sup> (Ex. 17:6).</p>
<p>When the locusts came<sup><xref rid="fn981">28</xref></sup> Pharaoh gave some of the Israelites permission to go and sacrifice (Ex. 10:11). After the plague of darkness Pharaoh gave them all permission to go, with the exception that their cattle were to remain (Ex. 11:24). Now when they saw that a plague came and struck their first-born, Moses&#x2019; words, <italic>lest he fall upon us with pestilence</italic>, became clear.<sup><xref rid="fn982">29</xref></sup> They therefore said, <italic>We are all dead men</italic> (Ex. 12:33). The Egyptians then chased them out (Ex. 12:39) to go and sacrifice.<sup><xref rid="fn983">30</xref></sup> They also let them have what they asked for (Ex. 12:36).</p>
<p>4. AND THE KING OF EGYPT SAID. The word <italic>tafri&#x2019;u</italic> (ye cause to break loose) means ye cause to disrupt.<sup><xref rid="fn984">31</xref></sup> <italic>Yifra</italic> (cast off restraint) in <italic>When there is no vision, the people cast off restraint</italic> (yifra)<sup><xref rid="fn985">32</xref></sup> (Prov. 29:18) is similar. Pharaoh included Moses and Aaron in <italic>get you unto your burdens</italic>, for Moses and Aaron represented all of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn986">33</xref></sup> <italic>Your burdens</italic> does not mean your affairs.<sup><xref rid="fn987">34</xref></sup> <italic>And will ye make them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn988">35</xref></sup> <italic>rest from their burdens</italic> (v. 5) proves the aforementioned.<sup><xref rid="fn989">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND PHARAOH SAID. Yefet says that the meaning of <italic>the people of the land are now many</italic> is, we are not concerned if pestilence or sword befalls them, for those who toil<sup><xref rid="fn990">37</xref></sup> are many.<sup><xref rid="fn991">38</xref></sup> However, according to my opinion its meaning is, you are seeking to cause a great amount of work to cease.</p>
<p>6. AND THE SAME DAY PHARAOH COMMANDED. The taskmasters were Egyptian and the officers of the people were Israelites.</p>
<p>7. YE SHALL NO MORE GIVE. <italic>Tosifun</italic> (ye shall more)<sup><xref rid="fn992">39</xref></sup> is spelled with an <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn993">40</xref></sup> However, it is usually spelled with a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn994">41</xref></sup> Both of these letters<sup><xref rid="fn995">42</xref></sup> interchange with the <italic>yod</italic>.</p>
<p>[STRAW.] It is customary for those who build with soil to mix it with straw or chaff so that it will last.</p>
<p>TO MAKE BRICK. <italic>Lilbon</italic> (to make brick) comes from the same root as <italic>levenah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn996">43</xref></sup> (brick). A brick structure is stronger than a stone structure,<sup><xref rid="fn997">44</xref></sup> because a structure made out of soil<sup><xref rid="fn998">45</xref></sup> will be damaged by water and a stone structure will be harmed by fire.<sup><xref rid="fn999">46</xref></sup> It is similarly written, <italic>And they had brick for stone</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1000">47</xref></sup> <italic>and slime had they for mortar</italic> (Gen. 11:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1001">48</xref></sup> Note, there are nouns that are vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic>, such as the word <italic>sefer</italic> (book),<sup><xref rid="fn1002">49</xref></sup> or a <italic>segol</italic>, i.e., <italic>tzedek</italic> (righteousness),<sup><xref rid="fn1003">50</xref></sup> whose status does not change<sup><xref rid="fn1004">51</xref></sup> at an <italic>etnach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1005">52</xref></sup> or at the end of a verse.<sup><xref rid="fn1006">53</xref></sup> The word <italic>teven</italic> (straw) falls into this category.<sup><xref rid="fn1007">54</xref></sup> We not know the reason for the this; however, such is the case.</p>
<p>AND GATHER. <italic>Ve-kosheshu</italic> (and gather) comes from the same root as <italic>kash</italic> (stubble).<sup><xref rid="fn1008">55</xref></sup> comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn1009">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND THE TALE. <italic>Matkonet</italic> means tale. It refers to a specified amount.</p>
<p>9. LET HEAVIER WORK BE LAID. Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>al yishu</italic> (let them not regard) is like <italic>al yishanu</italic> (let them not rely)<sup><xref rid="fn1010">57</xref></sup> with the <italic>nun</italic> omitted, as it is in the word <italic>tet</italic> (to put)<sup><xref rid="fn1011">58</xref></sup> in <italic>I begin to put the dread of thee</italic> (Deut. 2:25).</p>
<p>Pay no attention nor listen to the dreamer who says that the root of <italic>tet</italic> is <italic>tat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1012">59</xref></sup> Because he found Scripture employing the word <italic>tattah</italic> (you put) in <italic>My enemies you put to flight before me</italic> (II Sam. 22:41), he thought that <italic>tattah</italic> is like <italic>shattah</italic> (thou hast set)<sup><xref rid="fn1013">60</xref></sup> in <italic>Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee</italic> (Ps. 90:8). Now he cannot deny that the second <italic>tav</italic> in the word <italic>tattah</italic> indicates the second person<sup><xref rid="fn1014">61</xref></sup> and the <italic>tav</italic> of the root is swallowed in the <italic>dagesh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1015">62</xref></sup> even though the <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1016">63</xref></sup> should receive a <italic>dagesh</italic> like the <italic>tav</italic> in <italic>ve-hishbatti</italic> (and I will cause to cease) in <italic>and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land</italic> (Lev. 26:6). Since this is the case<sup><xref rid="fn1017">64</xref></sup> it is better for the <italic>nun</italic> to be swallowed<sup><xref rid="fn1018">65</xref></sup> as it is swallowed by the <italic>tav</italic> in the word <italic>va-amitto</italic> (and his truth) (Gen. 24:27), for the word <italic>amitto</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1019">66</xref></sup> should have been written <italic>aminto</italic> and the word <italic>bat</italic> (daughter), <italic>benat</italic> and the word <italic>tet, tenet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1020">67</xref></sup> The missing first <italic>nun</italic> of the word <italic>tattah</italic> in <italic>tattah li</italic> is similar to the missing <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>rad</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1021">68</xref></sup> (spent) in <italic>the day was far spent</italic> (Jud. 19:11) and to the missing <italic>nun</italic> in the word <italic>ga</italic> (touch)<sup><xref rid="fn1022">69</xref></sup> in <italic>Touch the mountains, that they may smoke</italic> (Ps. 144:5).</p>
<p>However, in my opinion the word <italic>yishu</italic> (regard) means slack off, as Pharaoh said, <italic>for they are idle</italic> (nirpim) (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn1023">70</xref></sup> <italic>Yishu</italic> is similar to <italic>hasha</italic> (let go) in <italic>Let go of me</italic> (Ps. 39:14)<sup><xref rid="fn1024">71</xref></sup> and <italic>she&#x2019;u</italic> (let go) in <italic>Let go of me</italic> (Is. 22:4),<sup><xref rid="fn1025">72</xref></sup> and to <italic>hasha</italic> (weaken) in <italic>And weaken</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1026">73</xref></sup> <italic>their eyes</italic> (Is. 6:10), for when the eyes weaken they grow dim.<sup><xref rid="fn1027">74</xref></sup> <italic>Tishenah</italic> (shall be closed) in <italic>And the eyes of them that see shall be closed</italic> (Is. 32:3) is similar.</p>
<p>[LYING WORDS.] Its meaning is, because<sup><xref rid="fn1028">75</xref></sup> of the lying words that Moses and Aaron assure them with.<sup><xref rid="fn1029">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. WENT OUT. Of the king&#x2019;s palace to the people who were working.<sup><xref rid="fn1030">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. GO YOURSELVES, GET YOU STRAW WHERE YE CAN FIND IT. Close by or far off.</p>
<p>FOR NOUGHT OF YOUR WORK SHALL BE DIMINISHED. <italic>Nigra</italic> (diminished) is a participle.<sup><xref rid="fn1031">78</xref></sup> It is therefore vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> as is the rule.<sup><xref rid="fn1032">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. WERE SCATTERED. <italic>Va-yafetz</italic> (were scattered) is a transitive verb.<sup><xref rid="fn1033">80</xref></sup> Pharaoh, who caused them to scatter, is the subject.<sup><xref rid="fn1034">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR STRAW. In place of straw.<sup><xref rid="fn1035">82</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>la-chomer</italic> (for mortar) in <italic>and slime had they for mortar</italic> (Gen. 11:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1036">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND THE TASKMASTERS WERE URGENT. <italic>Atzim</italic> (urgent) is a transitive verb.<sup><xref rid="fn1037">84</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>shav</italic> (returned) and the word <italic>mash</italic> (moved), which is sometimes found transitive and at times intransitive.</p>
<p>[SAYING.] Its meaning is, saying to them.<sup><xref rid="fn1038">85</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>DAILY. The phrase <italic>devar yom be-yomo</italic> (daily)<sup><xref rid="fn1039">86</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>And from one sabbath to another</italic> (Is. 66:23).<sup><xref rid="fn1040">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THE OFFICERS&#x2026;OVER THEM. Over the Israelites.</p>
<p>[BOTH YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY.] I have previously explained<sup><xref rid="fn1041">88</xref></sup> the use of the additional <italic>gam</italic> (both).<sup><xref rid="fn1042">89</xref></sup> Now, <italic>both yesterday</italic> refers to the day that Moses did the signs before the eyes of the people and they consequently were not occupied with their work. <italic>To-day</italic> refers to the day that Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh.<sup><xref rid="fn1043">90</xref></sup> And thus it is written, <italic>And the same day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1044">91</xref></sup> <italic>Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people</italic> (v. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn1045">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. WHEREFORE DEALEST THOU THUS WITH THY SERVANTS? It was never your practice to do this.<sup><xref rid="fn1046">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>[16. BUT THE FAULT IS IN THINE OWN PEOPLE.] The word <italic>ve-chatat</italic> (but the fault is)<sup><xref rid="fn1047">94</xref></sup> is a verb in the perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn1048">95</xref></sup> However, the <italic>vav</italic> changes it into an imperfect in accordance with the rules of grammar.<sup><xref rid="fn1049">96</xref></sup> The word is similar to <italic>ve-chate&#x2019;ah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1050">97</xref></sup> Now when the <italic>alef</italic> was silenced, as it is in the word <italic>chata</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1051">98</xref></sup> it was not possible to place a <italic>heh</italic> after the <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1052">99</xref></sup> They therefore substituted a <italic>tav</italic> for the <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1053">100</xref></sup> There is no need to place a <italic>dagesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1054">101</xref></sup> in the <italic>tet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1055">102</xref></sup> The word <italic>ve-karat</italic> (will befall)<sup><xref rid="fn1056">103</xref></sup> in <italic>and evil will befall you</italic> (Deut. 31:29) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1057">104</xref></sup> The word <italic>am</italic> (people) is here a feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn1058">105</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ha-am</italic> (the people) in <italic>the people that were therein, how they dwelt</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1059">106</xref></sup> <italic>in security</italic> (Jud. 18:7) and <italic>ha-am</italic> (the people) in <italic>Why is this people of Jerusalem slidden back</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1060">107</xref></sup> (Jer. 8:5). Its meaning is,<sup><xref rid="fn1061">108</xref></sup> but the sin will be upon you. Moses out of respect alluded to Pharaoh by saying that the sin would be on his people.<sup><xref rid="fn1062">109</xref></sup> <italic>That I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders</italic> (I Kings 1:21),<sup><xref rid="fn1063">110</xref></sup> <italic>And our enemies mock us as they please</italic> (Ps. 80:7),<sup><xref rid="fn1064">111</xref></sup> and <italic>Thus they exchanged their glory</italic> (Ps. 106:20)<sup><xref rid="fn1065">112</xref></sup> are similar.</p>
<p>17. BUT HE SAID. Your words did not avail, as Pharaoh was steadfast in the hardness of his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn1066">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. GO THEREFORE NOW, AND WORK. Pharaoh said this to the officers,<sup><xref rid="fn1067">114</xref></sup> as they too were obligated to work.</p>
<p>19. DID SEE. This verse is connected to the verses that follow it.<sup><xref rid="fn1068">115</xref></sup> They saw themselves in dire straits<sup><xref rid="fn1069">116</xref></sup> because Pharaoh had said to them, <italic>Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, your daily task</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1070">117</xref></sup> Then they met Moses and Aaron and complained to them.<sup><xref rid="fn1071">118</xref></sup> The word <italic>otam</italic> (they) means themselves,<sup><xref rid="fn1072">119</xref></sup> their very bodies.<sup><xref rid="fn1073">120</xref></sup> <italic>Otam</italic> (themselves) in <italic>But the shepherds fed themselves</italic> (Ezek. 34:8) and <italic>oto</italic> (himself)<sup><xref rid="fn1074">121</xref></sup> in <italic>and he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1075">122</xref></sup> <italic>buried himself in the valley</italic> (Deut. 34:6)<sup><xref rid="fn1076">123</xref></sup> are similar. Rabbi Moses ben Balaam<sup><xref rid="fn1077">124</xref></sup> says that <italic>oto</italic> (it)<sup><xref rid="fn1078">125</xref></sup> in <italic>he shall bring it</italic> (oto) <italic>unto the door of the tent of meeting</italic> (Num. 6:13)<sup><xref rid="fn1079">126</xref></sup> is also similar. However, in my opinion its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn1080">127</xref></sup> is that the priest shall command to bring him.<sup><xref rid="fn1081">128</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND THEY MET. The words &#x201C;who were&#x201D; are missing.<sup><xref rid="fn1082">129</xref></sup> Our text should be read as if written: who were standing.<sup><xref rid="fn1083">130</xref></sup> <italic>And Pharaoh dreams</italic> (Gen. 41:1)<sup><xref rid="fn1084">131</xref></sup> is similar. Its meaning is, and Pharaoh was dreaming. Similarly, <italic>and behold he was standing by the river</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1085">132</xref></sup> There are many other such instances in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1086">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THEY SAID UNTO THEM: THE LORD LOOK. At the violence done to us, the responsibility for which falls upon you.</p>
<p>[YE HAVE MADE OUR SAVOUR TO BE ABHORRED IN THE EYES OF PHARAOH.] Note that the five senses are perceived in one place located above the forehead.<sup><xref rid="fn1087">134</xref></sup> Hence one sense is substituted for another sense,<sup><xref rid="fn1088">135</xref></sup> as in <italic>And the light is sweet</italic> (Eccles. 11:7).<sup><xref rid="fn1089">136</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Merinus says that its meaning is, we are as disgusting and abhorrent in his eyes as a foul odor.<sup><xref rid="fn1090">137</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND MOSES RETURNED. Now a question: Why did Moses complain and say, <italic>Why is it that thou hast sent me?</italic> and <italic>Neither hast thou delivered Thy people at all</italic> after God told him, <italic>And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go</italic> (Ex. 3:19) until he performed all the signs that God commanded him? The answer is, Moses thought that Pharaoh would lighten Israel&#x2019;s yoke as soon as he spoke to him. However, Pharaoh placed a heavier workload upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn1091">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHEREFORE HAST THOU DEALT ILL WITH THIS PEOPLE?] Contrary to Your words, <italic>I have surely seen the affliction of My people</italic> (Ex. 3:7); <italic>And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>[WHY IS IT THAT THOU HAST SENT ME] To harm Israel. Behold,<sup><xref rid="fn1092">139</xref></sup> I have not found an answer to give the officers.<sup><xref rid="fn1093">140</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. FOR SINCE. From the day that I spoke to Pharaoh he hardened his yoke over them, as it is written, <italic>And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people</italic> (v. 6).</p>
<p>[NEITHER HAST THOU DELIVERED.] My very thought was that Pharaoh would begin to lighten their burden<sup><xref rid="fn1094">141</xref></sup> and You would begin to deliver them.</p>
<p>[HE HAS DEALT ILL WITH THIS PEOPLE.] The word <italic>hera</italic> (he has dealt ill) is a transitive verb.<sup><xref rid="fn1095">142</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>here&#x2019;u</italic> (they did worse)<sup><xref rid="fn1096">143</xref></sup> in <italic>they did worse than their fathers</italic> (Jer. 7:26).</p>

<ftnote id="fn964"><sup>11</sup> Moses answered Pharaoh that <italic>YHVH</italic> is the God of the Hebrews. We deduce from this that Pharaoh had asked, &#x201C;Who is this God <italic>YHVH</italic>?&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn965"><sup>12</sup> The Tetragrammaton.</ftnote>

See I.E. Ex. 21:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn969"><sup>16</sup> The Hebrew word for met comes from the root <italic>kof, resh, heh</italic> (<italic>karah</italic>). However, <italic>nikra</italic> (spelled with an <italic>alef</italic>) comes from the root <italic>kof, resh, alef</italic>. I.E. points out that the <italic>alef</italic> and the <italic>heh</italic> interchange. For <italic>nikro</italic> (<italic>spelled with an alef</italic>) comes from the root <italic>kof, resh, alef</italic> and means met, (happened by chance) while <italic>nikreti</italic> (I happened by chance), from the root <italic>kof, resh, heh</italic> (the <italic>heh</italic> changes to a <italic>yod</italic> in the perfect) has a similar meaning.

<ftnote id="fn1017"><sup>64</sup> That neither <italic>tav</italic> in <italic>tattah</italic> is a root letter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1018"><sup>65</sup> That is, it is better to assume that the root of <italic>tattah</italic> is <italic>nun, tav, nun</italic> rather than <italic>tav, vav, tav</italic>, as the root <italic>nun, tav, nun</italic> is found in Scripture but the root <italic>tav, vav, tav</italic> as a verb is not.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1058"><sup>105</sup> <italic>Am</italic> is usually masculine. However, here the verb governing it, <italic>viz., ve-chatat</italic>, is feminine. Hence it too must be feminine.</ftnote>

How can God be called by the name &#x201C;Who is enough?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1103">7</xref></sup> <italic>Shaddai</italic> therefore can only be taken as an adjective, like the words <italic>tov</italic> (good) and <italic>sallach</italic> (ready to pardon) in <italic>good, and ready to pardon</italic> (Ps. 86:5) and <italic>davvai</italic> (faint)<sup><xref rid="fn1104">8</xref></sup> in <italic>My heart is faint within me</italic> (Jer. 8:18). Now Rabbi Samuel the Nagid explains <italic>Shaddai</italic> with the Arabic word <italic>al kahar</italic>, which means victorious and mighty. He further notes that the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>Shaddai</italic> is in place of the double letter,<sup><xref rid="fn1105">9</xref></sup> like the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>dalyu</italic> (hang limp)<sup><xref rid="fn1106">10</xref></sup> in <italic>The legs hang limp from the lame</italic> (Prov. 26:7) and the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>baze&#x2019;u</italic> (divide)<sup><xref rid="fn1107">11</xref></sup> in <italic>Whose land the rivers divide</italic> (Is. 18:2). <italic>Shaddai</italic> (mighty) in <italic>like a mighty voice</italic> (Ezek. 1:24)<sup><xref rid="fn1108">12</xref></sup> and <italic>Shaddai</italic> (mighty) in <italic>And mighty shall he thy silver</italic> (Job 22:25)<sup><xref rid="fn1109">13</xref></sup> are similar. The Nagid explained it well.<sup><xref rid="fn1110">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>[I MADE ME NOT KNOWN TO THEM.] The word <italic>nodati</italic> (I made Me known) is in the <italic>nifal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1111">15</xref></sup> It is not like <italic>hodati</italic> (I made known)<sup><xref rid="fn1112">16</xref></sup> as Menachem maintains.<sup><xref rid="fn1113">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BUT BY MY NAME YHVH.] Rabbi Merinus says that <italic>u-shemi YHVH</italic> (But by my name YHVH)<sup><xref rid="fn1114">18</xref></sup> is an oath, as in Arabic there is a <italic>vav</italic> which indicates an oath.<sup><xref rid="fn1115">19</xref></sup> Rabbi Merinus explains the meaning of <italic>I made Me not known to them</italic> as: I made Me not known to them as I made Me known to you.<sup><xref rid="fn1116">20</xref></sup> However, we never find a <italic>vav</italic> with this meaning in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1117">21</xref></sup> This then is its grammatical explanation.<sup><xref rid="fn1118">22</xref></sup> There are words that are to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn1119">23</xref></sup> The same applies to letters.<sup><xref rid="fn1120">24</xref></sup> For example, the <italic>mem</italic> prefaced to <italic>me&#x2019;el</italic> (From the God) in <italic>From the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and the</italic> (ve-et) <italic>Almighty, who shall bless thee</italic> (Gen. 49: 25)<sup><xref rid="fn1121">25</xref></sup> is also to be placed before <italic>ve-et</italic> (and the) and be read as if written <italic>u-me&#x2019;et</italic> (and from the).<sup><xref rid="fn1122">26</xref></sup> Similarly the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>be&#x2019;el Shaddai</italic> (as God Almighty).<sup><xref rid="fn1123">27</xref></sup> Our phrase is thus to be read as if written: <italic>but by My name YHVH</italic> (u-vi-shemi) <italic>I made Me not known to them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1124">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that the word <italic>le-vado</italic> (only) has been omitted from the end of our clause. Our text should be read as if written: but I made Me not known to them <span class="underline">only</span> by My name <italic>YHVH</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1125">29</xref></sup> On the contrary, I at times appeared to them with the name <italic>El Shaddai</italic> (God Almighty) and at other times with the name <italic>YHVH</italic>. In my opinion, thy name shall not be called any more <span class="underline">only</span> Jacob, but Israel shall be used with it (Gen. 35:10)<sup><xref rid="fn1126">30</xref></sup> is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1127">31</xref></sup> Really, there is no need for Saadiah Gaon&#x2019;s reconstruction<sup><xref rid="fn1128">32</xref></sup> because we know that <italic>El Shaddai</italic> and the blessed and glorious Lord are one and the same,<sup><xref rid="fn1129">33</xref></sup> except that the term <italic>El Shaddai</italic> is an adjective and the glorious and revered name<sup><xref rid="fn1130">34</xref></sup> is, as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn1131">35</xref></sup> sometimes a noun and sometimes an adjective. Now we find it written with regard to Abraham, <italic>I am the Lord</italic> (YHVH) <italic>that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it</italic> (Gen. 15:7). We similarly find with regard to Jacob, <italic>I am the Lord</italic> (YHVH), <italic>the God of Abraham thy father</italic> (Gen. 28:13).<sup><xref rid="fn1132">36</xref></sup> Rabbi Joshua says that Abraham and Jacob did not know the name <italic>YHVH</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1133">37</xref></sup> Moses used it when writing the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1134">38</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Joshua is incorrect, for how would Moses dare to write a name that God did not utter.<sup><xref rid="fn1135">39</xref></sup> There is no doubt that the patriarchs knew the name <italic>YHVH</italic> as a proper name. However, they did not know it as an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn1136">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will now reveal to you part of the secret meaning of the name <italic>El Shaddai</italic>. We know that God created the three worlds that I have previously noted.<sup><xref rid="fn1137">41</xref></sup> Everything in the lowest world receives power from the middle world according to the arrangements<sup><xref rid="fn1138">42</xref></sup> in the higher world. Due to the fact that man&#x2019;s soul comes from above the middle world, if it is wise and recognizes the works of God, both those done without an intermediary<sup><xref rid="fn1139">43</xref></sup> and those done via an intermediary<sup><xref rid="fn1140">44</xref></sup> and if the soul forsakes the pleasures of this lowest world and separates itself from them to cleave to God the glorious, should there be at the time of the birth of such a person an arrangement of the stars indicating that evil will befall this man on a certain day, the God to whom this man cleaves will set the chain of events in such a way that this man is saved from the evil that was destined to befall him. Similarly, if it is in the arrangement of the stars that this man be sterile God will make him virile and he will sire children. Therefore our sages said that God told Abraham, &#x201C;Leave your astrological calculations.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1141">45</xref></sup> The statement &#x201C;Israel has no star&#x201D; is close in meaning to the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn1142">46</xref></sup> I will yet explain this in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1143">47</xref></sup> Therefore, before God said to Abraham, <italic>and I will multiply thy seed</italic>, he told him, <italic>I am God Almighty</italic> (El Shaddai) (Gen. 17:1), the meaning of which is: I overcome the upper arrangements. The aforementioned does not mean that the arrangements are destroyed. It rather means that the one who cleaves to God knows that God creates good things for him that are not in keeping with what the stars have determined for him.<sup><xref rid="fn1144">48</xref></sup> Jacob therefore said, <italic>the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil</italic> (Gen. 48:16), i.e., all evil that was destined<sup><xref rid="fn1145">49</xref></sup> to come upon me. This is, as I will explain, the secret of the whole Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1146">50</xref></sup> Now the patriarchs did not reach the level where they were able to cleave unto God as Moses, <italic>whom the Lord knew face to face</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1147">51</xref></sup> did. Moses was therefore able to change the laws governing the lower world<sup><xref rid="fn1148">52</xref></sup> and produce signs and wonders<sup><xref rid="fn1149">53</xref></sup> that the patriarchs were incapable of. Now Moses said two things to the Lord. One, <italic>why is it that Thou hast sent me</italic> (Ex. 5:22)? Two, <italic>neither hast Thou delivered Thy people</italic> (Ex. 5:23). God answered the latter with, <italic>Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh</italic> (v. 1). He answered the former<sup><xref rid="fn1150">54</xref></sup> with, <italic>I am the Lord</italic> (v. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn1151">55</xref></sup> The meaning<sup><xref rid="fn1152">56</xref></sup> is that via the patriarchs My name <italic>El Shaddai</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1153">57</xref></sup> was publicized, but through you My revered name <italic>YHVH</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1154">58</xref></sup> will be known in the world. As God said, <italic>Wherefore say unto the children of Israel: I am the Lord</italic> (YHVH) (v. 6), the meaning of which is, behold, I have sent you to make this name known.</p>
<p>4. AND I HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED. I have also sent you because I have established my covenant with the patriarchs to give the land of Canaan to them or to their children who are their equivalent.</p>
<p>5. AND MOREOVER. I have also sent you because the children of Israel have repented<sup><xref rid="fn1155">59</xref></sup> and have cried out unto me.</p>
<p>6. WHEREFORE. As I live so will my word live. I will redeem you with an arm stretched from the heaven to the earth.</p>
<p>7. AND I WILL TAKE YOU TO ME. When you receive the Torah on Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>[WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT.] Its meaning is that according to the great combination of the stars in heaven<sup><xref rid="fn1156">60</xref></sup> Israel was destined to remain in exile. This will be explained in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic>.</p>
<p>8. AND I WILL BRING YOU INTO THE LAND. For many of those who left Egypt entered Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn1157">61</xref></sup> Additionally, their children are their equivalent.<sup><xref rid="fn1158">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHICH I LIFTED UP MY HAND.] This is to be understood figuratively. God is compared to a man who lifts up his hand to heaven and swears. It is like <italic>For I lift up My hand to heaven</italic> (Deut. 32:40) and <italic>when he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven</italic> (Dan. 12:7).<sup><xref rid="fn1159">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>[I AM THE LORD.] Its meaning is, I will cause this to come about.</p>
<p>9. AND MOSES SPOKE. Israel did not hearken nor pay attention to the words of Moses, as their spirit was impatient because of the length of their exile and the hard labor which was recently put upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn1160">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND THE LORD SPOKE&#x2026;SAYING. To Moses. <italic>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them</italic> (Lev. 1:2) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1161">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. GO IN. To the king&#x2019;s palace.</p>
<p>12. AND MOSES SPOKE BEFORE THE LORD, SAYING. <italic>Behold, the children of Israel</italic> who are thy people <italic>have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh</italic> who is a king, and is not a member of your people <italic>hear me</italic>. Furthermore, it is a great handicap for me who am <italic>of uncircumcised lips</italic> to speak before him. Before I went to see Pharaoh for the first time You promised me that You would instruct my mouth not to pronounce a letter which is too difficult for me.<sup><xref rid="fn1162">66</xref></sup> However, now I may stumble in my words before him.<sup><xref rid="fn1163">67</xref></sup> Furthermore, You said that Aaron shall be the intermediary between me and Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1164">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND AARON. God now included all the details.<sup><xref rid="fn1165">69</xref></sup> Aaron was also going to be the intermediary between Moses and Pharaoh, as Scripture will go on to explain. God&#x2019;s command was therefore directed to both of them.</p>
<p>AND GAVE THEM A CHARGE. To go <italic>unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt</italic>. However, Rabbi Joshua says that <italic>and gave them a charge</italic> means, and gave them a charge not to be angry at the children of Israel if they did not hearken unto them.<sup><xref rid="fn1166">70</xref></sup> This interpretation is unnecessary.<sup><xref rid="fn1167">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. THESE ARE THE HEADS OF THEIR FATHER&#x2019;S HOUSES. Moses and Aaron&#x2019;s father, or it refers to the children of Israel who are mentioned above.<sup><xref rid="fn1168">72</xref></sup> The men mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn1169">73</xref></sup> were among those who descended to Egypt. Scripture starts with Reuben because the only honor left to him was to be listed first in the genealogy.<sup><xref rid="fn1170">74</xref></sup> These four sons of Reuben<sup><xref rid="fn1171">75</xref></sup> descended to Egypt.</p>
<p>15. AND THE SONS OF SIMEON. The family of Ohad was destroyed in Egypt or in the desert, as it is not mentioned in the Torah portion <italic>Phinehas</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1172">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>ZERAH. Zohar and Zerah are one and the same.<sup><xref rid="fn1173">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THE SONS OF LEVI. These two tribes<sup><xref rid="fn1174">78</xref></sup> were mentioned first because they were older than Levi. Here Scripture is mainly concerned with Levi,<sup><xref rid="fn1175">79</xref></sup> as the Torah has no other intention now than to list the genealogy of Moses and Aaron. Gershon, Kohath, and Merari are mentioned in the order of their birth. They descended to Egypt.</p>
<p>[THESE ARE THAT AARON AND MOSES.] Aaron is mentioned first because of his age.<sup><xref rid="fn1176">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture mentions how long Levi lived but does not do so for the other tribal patriarchs out of respect for Moses and Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn1177">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THE SONS OF GERSHON. He had no sons but these two.</p>
<p>18. AND THE SONS OF KOHATH. Scripture mentions how long Kohath lived but does not do the same for Gershon and Merari out of respect for the messengers.<sup><xref rid="fn1178">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND THE SONS OF MERARI. His sons numbered two; there were no more. Scripture therefore says, <italic>These are the families of the Levites according to their generations</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1179">83</xref></sup> for those who descended to Egypt did not sire any children<sup><xref rid="fn1180">84</xref></sup> except for these sons of Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn1181">85</xref></sup> Scripture also mentions how long Amram lived,<sup><xref rid="fn1182">86</xref></sup> out of respect for his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn1183">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THE SONS OF IZHAR. They are mentioned because of Korah who quarreled with Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1184">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND THE SONS OF UZZIEL. Uzziel is mentioned because of the honor given in the Torah to Mishael and Elzaphan.<sup><xref rid="fn1185">89</xref></sup> Scripture did not care to mention the sons of Hebron.<sup><xref rid="fn1186">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND AARON TOOK. Aaron&#x2019;s wife is mentioned out of respect for Eleazar.<sup><xref rid="fn1187">91</xref></sup> Scripture notes that Elisheba was <italic>the sister of Nahshon</italic> because of the honor of the priesthood.<sup><xref rid="fn1188">92</xref></sup> The sons of Korah are mentioned because they were righteous, as it is written, <italic>Notwithstanding the sons of Korah died not</italic> (Num. 26:11). The prophet Samuel was a descendant of Korah.<sup><xref rid="fn1189">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND ELEAZAR. Eleazar&#x2019;s wife is mentioned out of respect for Phinehas, as the priesthood was given to him eternally. Hence, logically speaking, Putiel was an Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn1190">94</xref></sup> We do not know the meaning of Putiel as we do not know the meaning of Mishael and Aaron and all the other names that are mentioned. If what happened to Moses had not been recorded,<sup><xref rid="fn1191">95</xref></sup> we would not know why he was so called.<sup><xref rid="fn1192">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. THESE ARE THAT AARON AND MOSES. Scripture mentions Aaron before Moses<sup><xref rid="fn1193">97</xref></sup> because Aaron was older and also because he prophesied to Israel before the arrival of Moses.</p>
<p>27. THESE. Now from the time that they spoke to Pharaoh, Scripture mentions Moses before Aaron because of his great status. Indeed, God spoke to him face to face<sup><xref rid="fn1194">98</xref></sup> and he alone drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.<sup><xref rid="fn1195">99</xref></sup> This was not the case with Aaron. Scripture testifies with regard to Moses, <italic>My servant Moses is not so</italic> (Num. 12:7).<sup><xref rid="fn1196">100</xref></sup> Furthermore, Aaron said, <italic>oh my lord</italic> twice.<sup><xref rid="fn1197">101</xref></sup> You will therefore not find in the entire Pentateuch starting from this verse Moses not mentioned before Aaron. The same holds true for the Prophets and similarly for the Writings. There is no argument to the contrary from <italic>Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses</italic> (Num. 3:1) or from, <italic>and she bore unto Amram Aaron and Moses</italic> (Num. 26:59), as Scripture lists them there in the order of their birth.<sup><xref rid="fn1198">102</xref></sup> The words <italic>generations</italic> and <italic>and she bore</italic> is proof of this.</p>
<p>28. AND IT CAME TO PASS. One may wonder why the arranger of the chapters<sup><xref rid="fn1199">103</xref></sup> did not<sup><xref rid="fn1200">104</xref></sup> connect this verse with what follows it<sup><xref rid="fn1201">105</xref></sup> when in fact it is dependent upon what comes next.<sup><xref rid="fn1202">106</xref></sup> Though we know no reason for the above,<sup><xref rid="fn1203">107</xref></sup> we do know that they are connected. <italic>On the day when the Lord spoke unto Moses in the land of Egypt</italic> (v. 28) what he told him was, <italic>I am the Lord; speak thou unto Pharaoh</italic>. (v. 29). Similarly, <italic>So, it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people</italic> (Deut. 2:16) is connected to that which follows it.<sup><xref rid="fn1204">108</xref></sup> Perhaps the one who arranged the places to stop knew why he did this,<sup><xref rid="fn1205">109</xref></sup> as his mind was much greater than ours.<sup><xref rid="fn1206">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. THAT THE LORD SPOKE. Scripture now goes back to the subject of <italic>And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron</italic> (Ex. 6:13),<sup><xref rid="fn1207">111</xref></sup> namely, <italic>Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt</italic> (Ex. 6:11).</p>
<ftnote id="fn1097"><sup>1</sup> That is, I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1098"><sup>2</sup> Ex. 8:15; 9:28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1099"><sup>3</sup> As an impersonal power. However, they did not know Him as a personal God who is concerned with man, i.e, as the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1100"><sup>4</sup> Which implies, I appeared in a vision. The Hebrew word for vision (<italic>mareh</italic>) and the word for, and I appeared (<italic>va-era</italic>) come from the same root, <italic>resh, alef, heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1101"><sup>5</sup> Its meaning is not self-evident.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1102"><sup>6</sup> According to Saadiah Gaon, <italic>Shaddai</italic> is composed of two words, <italic>she-dai</italic> (who is enough). He further explained that <italic>she-dai</italic> is short for <italic>she-amar le&#x2019;olam dai</italic>. Saadiah Gaon apparently interprets <italic>Shaddai</italic> as meaning the one who controls or sets a limit on nature. See <italic>Hagigah</italic> 12a, &#x201C;What is the meaning of <italic>ani El Shaddai</italic> (Gen. 17:1)? Its meaning is: I am (<italic>ani</italic>) the God (<italic>El</italic>) who said to my world <italic>dai</italic> (enough). Resh Lakish said: When the Holy One created the sea, it went spreading on until the Holy One rebuked it and made it dry (i.e., said to it, enough).&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1103"><sup>7</sup> I.E. was bothered by having a proper name that opens with a prefix (the <italic>shin</italic>) (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1104"><sup>8</sup> In other words, the <italic>shin</italic> in <italic>Shaddai</italic> is not a prefix but an integral part of the word, like the <italic>dalet</italic> in <italic>davvai</italic> and the <italic>samekh</italic> in <italic>sallach</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1105"><sup>9</sup> According to the Nagid the root of <italic>Shaddai</italic> is <italic>shin, dalet, dalet</italic>. (Cf. I.E. on Gen. 17:1 and the notes thereto.) <italic>Shaddai</italic> is spelled <italic>shin, dalet, yod</italic>. Thus one <italic>dalet</italic> is missing. Rabbi Samuel says that the <italic>yod</italic> takes the place of the <italic>dalet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1106"><sup>10</sup> The root of which is <italic>dalet, lamed, lamed</italic>. A <italic>lamed</italic> is missing in <italic>dalyu</italic> and is made up by the <italic>yod</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1107"><sup>11</sup> The root of <italic>baze&#x2019;u</italic> is <italic>bet, zayin, zayin</italic>. A <italic>zayin</italic> is missing in <italic>baze&#x2019;u</italic> and is made up by the <italic>alef</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1108"><sup>12</sup> Translated according to I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1109"><sup>13</sup> Translated according to I.E. See I.E.&#x2019;s commentary on Gen. 17:1 and note 2 thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1110"><sup>14</sup> I.E. agrees with the Nagid that <italic>Shaddai</italic> means mighty or the Almighty.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1111"><sup>15</sup> Its literal meaning is, I was known.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1112"><sup>16</sup> Which is in the <italic>hifil</italic>. According to Menachem ben Saruk, a tenth-century Sephardic philologist, the meaning of our clause is: but My name <italic>YHVH</italic> I made not known to them. See note 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1113"><sup>17</sup> For if we take Menachem&#x2019;s interpretation at face value, then Israel&#x2019;s forefathers were not aware of the divine name <italic>YHVH</italic>. However, there are many verses that show that the patriarchs were aware of this divine name. Cf. Gen. 15:2; 22:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1114"><sup>18</sup> The literal meaning of the verse is: and/but My name <italic>YHVH</italic> I made Me not known to them. The latter is grammatically incorrect, as it lacks the preposition &#x201C;by&#x201D; before &#x201C;My name,&#x201D; and it presents a problem for it implies that the patriarchs were not aware of the name <italic>YHVH</italic>. However, it is clear from the book of Genesis that Abraham and Jacob were acquainted with this name. The commentaries which follow try each in his own way to solve this problem.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1115"><sup>19</sup> Thus <italic>u-shemi YHVH</italic> can be interpreted as an oath, its meaning being: I swear by My name <italic>YHVH</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1116"><sup>20</sup> This is the thrust of <italic>I made Me not known to them</italic>. The meaning of the entire verse is: I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, and I swear by My name <italic>YHVH</italic> that I made Me not known to them as I made Me known to you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1117"><sup>21</sup> We never find a <italic>vav</italic> indicating an oath. Thus we can&#x2019;t interpret <italic>u-shemi YHVH</italic> as: I swear by My name <italic>YHVH</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1118"><sup>22</sup> Of <italic>u-shemi YHVH</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1121"><sup>25</sup> Translated according to I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1122"><sup>26</sup> The verse should thus be read as if written: From the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and from the Almighty, who shall bless thee. See I.E. on Gen. 49:25 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1123"><sup>27</sup> Also governs <italic>shemi</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1124"><sup>28</sup> Rather than the literal: but My name <italic>YHVH</italic> I made Me not known to them. I.E. will later elaborate on his explanation. See note 40.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1126"><sup>30</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of <italic>thy name shall not be called anymore Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1127"><sup>31</sup> According to I.E., Gen. 35:10 proves Saadiah Gaon&#x2019;s assertion that at times the word <italic>le-vado</italic>, although missing, is implied in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1128"><sup>32</sup> Of our verse. That is, it is to be read as if written, <italic>u-vi-shemi YHVH le-vado</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1129"><sup>33</sup> In other words, there is no difference between the name <italic>YHVH</italic> and <italic>El Shaddai</italic>. So what sign of divine favor is there in God telling Moses that He appears to him only as <italic>YHVH</italic> while He appeared to the patriarchs sometimes as <italic>El Shaddai</italic> and sometimes as <italic>YHVH?</italic> As to the question raised by our verse, I.E. answers it at the end of his comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1133"><sup>37</sup> Rabbi Joshua interprets <italic>but by My name YHVH I made Me not known to them</italic> literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1134"><sup>38</sup> When Moses wrote the book of Genesis and recorded the history of the patriarchs he employed the name that God revealed to him. However, God himself never used that name when He revealed Himself to the patriarchs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1135"><sup>39</sup> If in revealing himself to Abraham God said, &#x201C;I am <italic>El Shaddai</italic> who brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees,&#x201D; would Moses deliberately dare to write, &#x201C;I am <italic>YHVH</italic> that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees&#x201D; (Gen. 15:7).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1136"><sup>40</sup> Thus <italic>but My name YHVH I made Me not known to them</italic> means, they did not know the adjectival meaning of <italic>YHVH</italic>; that is, they did not experience the adjectival meaning of My name <italic>YHVH, viz.</italic>, My suspending the laws of nature (Krinsky).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1192"><sup>96</sup> Without knowing the background behind the naming of Moses we could never guess why he was so called. Similarly, we cannot ascertain the meaning of Putiel.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 7</title>
<p>I. AND THE LORD SAID. This was in response to, <italic>how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips</italic> (Ex. 6:12). God answered Moses, <italic>See I have set thee in God&#x2019;s stead to Pharaoh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1208">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE LORD SAID.<sup><xref rid="fn1209">2</xref></sup> Its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn1210">3</xref></sup> is: See, I have greatly elevated your status in that in Pharaoh&#x2019;s eyes your stature is that of an angel. This is what <italic>God&#x2019;s stead</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1211">4</xref></sup> means. <italic>God</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1212">5</xref></sup> speaks to the prophet and the prophet speaks to the men of his generation.<sup><xref rid="fn1213">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND AARON THY BROTHER SHALL BE THY PROPHET.] Those who say that the word <italic>navi</italic> (prophet) comes from the root of <italic>niv</italic> in <italic>niv sefatayim</italic> (the fruit of the lips) (Is. 57:19) err.<sup><xref rid="fn1214">7</xref></sup> <italic>Niv</italic> comes from a two-letter root according to the French sages and from a hidden <italic>ayin</italic> root according to the Spanish sages.<sup><xref rid="fn1215">8</xref></sup> However, <italic>navi</italic> comes from a three-letter root.<sup><xref rid="fn1216">9</xref></sup> That its <italic>alef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1217">10</xref></sup> is a root letter can be seen from the words <italic>nevi&#x2019;im</italic> (prophets) (Num. 11:29) and <italic>va-yitnabe&#x2019;u</italic> (they prophesied).<sup><xref rid="fn1218">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, the word <italic>niv</italic> in <italic>niv sefatayim</italic> means fruit,<sup><xref rid="fn1219">12</xref></sup> for <italic>niv</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>tenuvah</italic> (fruitage) (Is. 27:6) and <italic>yenuvun</italic> (they shall bring forth fruit) in <italic>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age</italic> (Ps. 92:15). <italic>Ve-nivo nivzeh okhlo</italic> (and the fruit thereof, even the food thereof, is contemptible) (Malachi 1:12) is true proof of this. Additionally, what meaning is there to, <italic>restore the man&#x2019;s wife; for he is a prophet</italic> (Gen. 20:7) if <italic>navi</italic> (prophet) means a speaker. Its only meaning<sup><xref rid="fn1220">13</xref></sup> is, he is a prophet to whom I reveal my secrets, as in <italic>But He revealeth His counsel unto His servants the prophets</italic> (Amos 3:7). He enjoys My presence therefore <italic>and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live</italic> (Gen. 20:7).</p>
<p>2. THOU SHALT SPEAK. To Aaron.</p>
<p>ALL THAT I COMMAND THEE; AND AARON THY BROTHER SHALL SPEAK UNTO PHARAOH. Even though Aaron is not mentioned every time<sup><xref rid="fn1221">14</xref></sup> that Moses came to Pharaoh, we know that they always came together.</p>
<p>3. AND I WILL HARDEN PHARAOH&#x2019;S HEART. The question arises: &#x201C;If God hardened Pharaoh&#x2019;s heart what was his transgression and what was his sin?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1222">15</xref></sup> The answer is: God granted wisdom to man and implanted in his heart the intelligence to receive power from on high to add to his good<sup><xref rid="fn1223">16</xref></sup> or to diminish his evil.<sup><xref rid="fn1224">17</xref></sup> I will explain this in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1225">18</xref></sup> and when I comment on the verse <italic>Oh that they had such a heart as this alway</italic> (Deut. 5:26). Now the meaning of our verse is: I will harden his heart in order to multiply My signs and My wonders.<sup><xref rid="fn1226">19</xref></sup> Rabbi Joshua says that its meaning is: I will harden his heart so that he will be able to bear the plagues.<sup><xref rid="fn1227">20</xref></sup> However, he spoke incorrectly.<sup><xref rid="fn1228">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND I WILL LAY MY HAND. That is, my blow, for a blow is struck with the hand. Scripture speaks anthropomorphically.</p>
<p>[MY HOSTS.] Its meaning is: as the angels are the Lord&#x2019;s hosts in heaven so are Israel<sup><xref rid="fn1229">22</xref></sup> upon the earth.</p>
<p>5. SHALL KNOW. Rabbi Judah, the first grammarian, has already noted the difference between <italic>ve-yade&#x2019;u</italic> (shall know) and <italic>ve-yede&#x2019;u</italic> (shall know). The word <italic>ve-yade&#x2019;u</italic>, which is vocalized with a long <italic>kamatz</italic>, is a verb in the perfect. Compare, <italic>shame&#x2019;u</italic> (they heard).<sup><xref rid="fn1230">23</xref></sup> The <italic>vav</italic> prefixed to <italic>yade&#x2019;u</italic> changes it<sup><xref rid="fn1231">24</xref></sup> to an imperfect as per the grammatical rules.<sup><xref rid="fn1232">25</xref></sup> On the other hand, the <italic>yod</italic> of the word <italic>ve-yede&#x2019;u</italic>, which is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1233">26</xref></sup> is a future prefix. Compare, <italic>ve-yishmeru</italic> (they shall keep).<sup><xref rid="fn1234">27</xref></sup> The silent <italic>yod</italic> between the <italic>yod</italic> and the <italic>dalet</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1235">28</xref></sup> is in place of the root <italic>yod</italic>. <sup><xref rid="fn1236">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Behold, God noted<sup><xref rid="fn1237">30</xref></sup> why He brought the plagues upon the Egyptians. He brought them so that His glorious name would be known in the world.<sup><xref rid="fn1238">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND MOSES AND AARON DID SO. Scripture now states generally that the signs<sup><xref rid="fn1239">32</xref></sup> were performed by Aaron and also by Moses. It then goes on to explain each one of the signs.</p>
<p>7. AND MOSES. The Pentateuch records the ages of Moses and Aaron. Aside from these two, we do not find in all of Scripture prophets concerning whom the Bible says that they prophesied in their old age.<sup><xref rid="fn1240">33</xref></sup> Their status was greater than that of all the other prophets, and to them alone did God speak in a pillar of cloud.<sup><xref rid="fn1241">34</xref></sup> Do not think that Samuel is to be included among them because it is written, <italic>He spoke unto them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1242">35</xref></sup><italic>in the pillar of cloud</italic> (Ps. 99:7), since I have already explained in its proper place that the Torah was given<sup><xref rid="fn1243">36</xref></sup> only to these two.<sup><xref rid="fn1244">37</xref></sup> Now, behold, through Moses and Aaron the righteous shall inherit the world to come, while all the other prophets are prophets who<sup><xref rid="fn1245">38</xref></sup> rebuke or predict the future.</p>
<p>8. AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON. God now began to direct His words to the two of them. God knew that at first Pharaoh would not ask for a sign but would merely say, <italic>I know not the Lord</italic> (Ex. 5:2). However, now Pharaoh would ask for a sign.<sup><xref rid="fn1246">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. TAKE THY ROD. The reference is to Moses&#x2019; rod which Moses had given to Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn1247">40</xref></sup> <italic>Say unto Aaron: Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand</italic> (v. 19); <italic>and he lifted up the rod</italic> (ba-matteh), <italic>and smote the waters</italic> (v. 20) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1248">41</xref></sup> Now by employing a <italic>bet</italic> that has a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath it<sup><xref rid="fn1249">42</xref></sup> Scripture is informing us that when He told him,<sup><xref rid="fn1250">43</xref></sup> <italic>Take thy rod</italic>, He was referring to the well-known rod. <italic>And thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go</italic> (Ex. 17:5)<sup><xref rid="fn1251">44</xref></sup> is additional proof of the above.<sup><xref rid="fn1252">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND MOSES AND AARON WENT IN. This too, namely, that the rod became a <italic>tannin</italic> (serpent), was a wonder.<sup><xref rid="fn1253">46</xref></sup> It was not like the wonder that he did for Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn1254">47</xref></sup> as there it only changed into a <italic>nachash</italic> (serpent).<sup><xref rid="fn1255">48</xref></sup> However, Yefet says that <italic>nachash</italic> (serpent) and <italic>tannin</italic> (serpent) are one and the same.<sup><xref rid="fn1256">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. THEN PHARAOH ALSO CALLED FOR THE WISE MEN. Astrologers.</p>
<p>AND THE SORCERERS. Those who appear to change natural law.<sup><xref rid="fn1257">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE MAGICIANS. Those who know the secrets of nature. <italic>Chartumim</italic> (magicians)<sup><xref rid="fn1258">51</xref></sup> is a quadriliteral.<sup><xref rid="fn1259">52</xref></sup> It might be an Egyptian or Chaldean word, as we do not find this word used in Scripture except when dealing with them.<sup><xref rid="fn1260">53</xref></sup> Scripture indicates a difference between what Moses did and what the magicians did. Moses really changed the staff into a serpent. As for the magicians, Scripture reads, <italic>with their secret arts</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1261">54</xref></sup> <italic>Be-lahatehem</italic> (with their secret arts) comes from a triliteral root.<sup><xref rid="fn1262">55</xref></sup> It is derived from the same root as <italic>lahat</italic> (flame) in <italic>the flaming sword</italic> (Gen. 3:24) and <italic>lohatim</italic> (them that are aflame) in <italic>I do lie down among them that are aflame</italic> (Ps. 57:5) and <italic>lihat</italic> (ablaze) in <italic>And the day that cometh shall set them ablaze</italic> (Mal. 3:19). It<sup><xref rid="fn1263">56</xref></sup> refers to an illusion of lightning and passing fire.<sup><xref rid="fn1264">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. FOR THEY CAST DOWN. This, the swallowing of the magicians&#x2019; rods by Aaron&#x2019;s staff and their consequent disappearance,<sup><xref rid="fn1265">58</xref></sup> was a second wonder.<sup><xref rid="fn1266">59</xref></sup> Scripture refers to the staff as <italic>Aaron&#x2019;s rod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1267">60</xref></sup> for it was so at first. Rabbi Joshua says that Aaron&#x2019;s rod swallowed the rods of the magicians after it returned to its original form.<sup><xref rid="fn1268">61</xref></sup> And this was a great wonder.</p>
<p>13. AND PHARAOH&#x2019;S HEART WAS HARDENED. By itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1269">62</xref></sup> Pharaoh saw that the magicians were able to do what Aaron did.<sup><xref rid="fn1270">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THE LORD SAID&#x2026;PHARAOH&#x2019;S HEART IS STUBBORN. <italic>Kaved</italic> (is stubborn) is a verb in the perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn1271">64</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>zaken</italic> (was old) in <italic>when Isaac was old</italic> (Gen. 27:1), <italic>chafetz</italic> (were pleased) in <italic>If the Lord were pleased</italic> (Jud. 13:23), <italic>ahev</italic> (he loveth) in <italic>such as he loveth</italic> (Gen. 27:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1272">65</xref></sup> The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>me&#x2019;en</italic> (refuseth), which is a root letter,<sup><xref rid="fn1273">66</xref></sup> is vocalized with a <italic>tzere</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1274">67</xref></sup> so that a <italic>dagesh</italic> is not placed in the <italic>alef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1275">68</xref></sup> which follows it.<sup><xref rid="fn1276">69</xref></sup> <italic>Cheref</italic> (jeoparded) in <italic>jeoparded their lives</italic> (Jud. 5:18) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1277">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. GET THEE UNTO PHARAOH IN THE MORNING. It is the custom of the king of Egypt until this very day to go out in the months of Tamuz and Ab to see how high the water has risen. This is the time the river increases. God commanded Moses to go in the morning and stand before the river and perform the sign of the striking of the river in the presence of Pharaoh. He commanded Moses to take and then give to Aaron the rod which he had turned into a serpent before coming unto Pharaoh (Ex. 4:3) and to wave it over the waters of Egypt so that Pharaoh would see with his very eyes the river turn into blood at the moment that Aaron struck it.</p>
<p>16. AND THOU SHALT SAY UNTO HIM. Say the following to him, because if he does not listen, this is the first plague. The rod which turned into a serpent (v. 10) was not a plague.</p>
<p>17. THUS SAITH THE LORD. The messenger speaks the word of the one who sent him.<sup><xref rid="fn1278">71</xref></sup> Moses was brief, for the term &#x201C;His messenger&#x201D; has been omitted. The statement should be understood thus: <italic>behold, I</italic> His messenger<sup><xref rid="fn1279">72</xref></sup> <italic>will smite with the rod that is in my hand</italic>.</p>
<p>[WITH THE ROD THAT IS IN MY HAND.] Moses said, <italic>that is in my hand</italic>, even though the rod was in Aaron&#x2019;s hand because they were equals<sup><xref rid="fn1280">73</xref></sup> and both participated in the performance of the sign.</p>
<p>18. AND THE FISH. <italic>Fish</italic> is a general term for all things that swarm in the waters.</p>
<p>SHALL LOATHE. <italic>Ve-nil&#x2019;u</italic> (shall loathe) is a <italic>nifal</italic> from the same root as the word <italic>la&#x2019;ah</italic> (weary).<sup><xref rid="fn1281">74</xref></sup> Its meaning is, will be unable.<sup><xref rid="fn1282">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND THE LORD SAID. According to my opinion this is to be understood as follows. Aaron waved his hand and struck the Nile. He also waved his hand toward all the sides of Egypt to turn the waters of all the rivers in the land of Egypt, that is, in the kingdom of Egypt, into blood.<sup><xref rid="fn1283">76</xref></sup> The term <italic>the waters of Egypt</italic> is a general term. <italic>Over their rivers</italic> is one of its particulars. The term <italic>ye&#x2019;or</italic> (stream)<sup><xref rid="fn1284">77</xref></sup> refers exclusively to the Nile. There are other rivers in Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn1285">78</xref></sup> for the blood was over all of their country.<sup><xref rid="fn1286">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>OVER THEIR STREAMS. The plural <italic>ye&#x2019;orehem</italic> (their streams)<sup><xref rid="fn1287">80</xref></sup> is employed<sup><xref rid="fn1288">81</xref></sup> because the Nile is found in many places.</p>
<p>THEIR POOLS. Pools of rainwater that form by themselves.</p>
<p>AND OVER THEIR PONDS OF WATER. This refers to fountains, wells, and cisterns.</p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon says that the word <italic>meyeme</italic> (water of),<sup><xref rid="fn1289">82</xref></sup> which is the word <italic>me</italic> (water of) doubled, refers to sweet water while the word <italic>me</italic> refers to bitter water, as in <italic>me ha-yam</italic> (waters of the sea). Scripture therefore reads, <italic>ha-kore le-me ha-yam</italic> (that calleth for the waters of the sea) (Amos 5:8). Now the Gaon forgot that Scripture states, <italic>me ha-yarden yikkaretun</italic> (the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off) (Josh. 3:13).<sup><xref rid="fn1290">83</xref></sup> The word <italic>me</italic> is always doubled when connected to a pronoun, as in the word <italic>memai</italic> (my water) (I Sam. 25:11) and in <italic>memekha</italic> (thy water) (Ezek. 12:18). This mode comes exclusively in the plural form,<sup><xref rid="fn1291">84</xref></sup> as it is incorrect to say <italic>memi</italic> (my water) and <italic>memah</italic> (her water).<sup><xref rid="fn1292">85</xref></sup> We find me<sup><xref rid="fn1293">86</xref></sup> used in the singular in <italic>because the water of</italic> (me) <italic>sprinkling was not dashed</italic> (Num. 19:13).<sup><xref rid="fn1294">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BOTH IN VESSELS OF WOOD AND IN VESSELS OF STONE.] That is, in water found in the homes in vessels made out of wood or basins made out of stone.</p>
<p>20. AND MOSES AND AARON DID. Scripture notes the smiting of the Nile. However, it does not bother to mention the waving of the hand over all the waters of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn1295">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT DID IN LIKE MANNER WITH THEIR SECRET ARTS. The word <italic>be-latehem</italic> (with their secret arts) comes from the same root as <italic>ba-lat</italic> (stealthily)<sup><xref rid="fn1296">89</xref></sup> in <italic>she approached him stealthily</italic> (Jud. 4:21).<sup><xref rid="fn1297">90</xref></sup> It means with secret things hidden from the eye. A <italic>heh</italic> has not been omitted from the word,<sup><xref rid="fn1298">91</xref></sup> for the <italic>heh</italic> is not an implied letter in the middle of a word.<sup><xref rid="fn1299">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>One may ask: If all the water in Egypt was turned into blood by Aaron, where did the magicians find the water to turn into blood? The answer is: Aaron turned only water that is found above ground into blood. He did not transform any water that was below ground.<sup><xref rid="fn1300">93</xref></sup> The magicians dug and brought forth water from beneath the ground and openly turned it into blood. Now, there is a great difference between what Aaron did and what the magicians brought about. Aaron transformed all of the Nile that was before him plus all the water that was in all the borders of Egypt, which he did not see.<sup><xref rid="fn1301">94</xref></sup> Furthermore, he changed water that was not standing still but was continually running, with other water taking its place, into blood. Additionally, the plague lasted for seven days. The magicians, on the other hand, were only able to transform a little water standing in a vessel, for a moment, until Pharaoh returned to his house.</p>
<p>23. AND PHARAOH TURNED. Scripture states <italic>even this</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1302">95</xref></sup> because it first mentioned the sign of the rod which turned into a serpent and swallowed the other rods.<sup><xref rid="fn1303">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. DIGGED. Many say that the water was as red as blood in the hands of an Egyptian and became clear in the hands of an Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn1304">97</xref></sup> If this is so then why doesn&#x2019;t the Torah record this sign? I believe that the plagues of blood, frogs, and gnats<sup><xref rid="fn1305">98</xref></sup> included both Egyptians and Hebrews, for we shall follow Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1306">99</xref></sup> These three plagues caused little harm. However, God differentiated between the Egyptians and the Israelites with regard to the swarms,<sup><xref rid="fn1307">100</xref></sup> which was a very harmful plague. So too with regard to the plagues of murrain<sup><xref rid="fn1308">101</xref></sup> and hail<sup><xref rid="fn1309">102</xref></sup> because of their flocks.<sup><xref rid="fn1310">103</xref></sup> This was not the case with the boils and locusts,<sup><xref rid="fn1311">104</xref></sup> for they<sup><xref rid="fn1312">105</xref></sup> left<sup><xref rid="fn1313">106</xref></sup> Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn1314">107</xref></sup> Now as the Egyptians <italic>digged</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1315">108</xref></sup> so did the Hebrews dig.<sup><xref rid="fn1316">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. WERE FULFILLED. Scripture notes this because unlike the other plagues, this plague lasted many days.</p>
<p>26. AND THE LORD SPOKE&#x2026;GO IN UNTO PHARAOH. With your brother Aaron and inform him of the second plague if he does not let my people go.<sup><xref rid="fn1317">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND IF. The word <italic>ma&#x2019;en</italic> (refuse) is a transitive<sup><xref rid="fn1318">111</xref></sup> participle.<sup><xref rid="fn1319">112</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>ve-shabbe&#x2019;ach</italic> (wherefore I praised)<sup><xref rid="fn1320">113</xref></sup> in <italic>Wherefore I praised the dead</italic> (Eccles. 4:2). The meaning of <italic>nogef</italic> (smite) is destroy. It is thus written, <italic>And frogs, which destroyed them</italic> (Ps. 78:45). The commentaries are divided as to the meaning of the word <italic>tzefarde&#x2019;im</italic> (frogs). Many say that it is a type of fish called <italic>al-timsach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1321">114</xref></sup> in Arabic that is found in Egypt, that arises from the river and preys upon people. Others say that it is the well-known sound-producing creature which is found in the majority of rivers.<sup><xref rid="fn1322">115</xref></sup> This interpretation appears to me to be correct.</p>
<p>28. AND THE RIVER SHALL SWARM. <italic>Ve-sharatz</italic> (shall swarm) is a transitive<sup><xref rid="fn1323">116</xref></sup> verb. It is like <italic>yishretzu</italic> (swarm)<sup><xref rid="fn1324">117</xref></sup> in <italic>Let the waters swarm</italic> (Gen. 1:20).</p>
<p>[WHICH SHALL GO UP.] The reason Scripture states this is that the river is always lower than the city.</p>
<p>29. BOTH UPON THEE, AND UPON THY PEOPLE. Yefet says that Scripture reads, <italic>both upon thee, and upon thy people</italic> to hint that the frogs shall affect only Pharaoh and his people but not Israel. However, this is no proof.<sup><xref rid="fn1325">118</xref></sup> Since Scripture mentions that the frogs shall go up upon him and upon all of his people,<sup><xref rid="fn1326">119</xref></sup> there was no reason to mention Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1327">120</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn1215"><sup>8</sup> According to Filwarg and others the Spanish and French sages differ only in terminology.

For the same reason the Spanish sages refer to it as a hidden <italic>ayin</italic> root. However, Krinsky argues that the French sages disagree as to what the root of <italic>niv</italic> is. The former hold that <italic>niv</italic> comes from a two-letter root; i.e., its root is <italic>nun, bet</italic>, while the Spanish sages believe it to come from the root <italic>nun, vav, bet</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1223"><sup>16</sup> If good things are destined to befall an individual he can increase the amount of good that will befall him by developing his intelligence.

<ftnote id="fn1225"><sup>18</sup> Ex. 31:18; 33:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1226"><sup>19</sup> God prevented Pharaoh from developing his intellectual capacities; God did this not to punish Pharaoh but so that He would have a pretext for multiplying His signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. I.E. apparently held that man has free will. However, God occasionally takes it away when it serves His purpose to do so. For other interpretations, see Weiser and Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1227"><sup>20</sup> Hence there is no problem as to why Pharaoh was punished for being obstinate; Pharaoh was a free agent. God; granted him the physical strength to bear His plagues. He did not take away Pharaoh&#x2019;s free will.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1228"><sup>21</sup> Rabbi Joshua is wrong. Heart in Scripture refers to an individual&#x2019;s mental rather than physical capacity. <italic>And I will harden Pharaoh&#x2019;s heart</italic> thus does not mean I will give Pharaoh a strong heart so that he can bear up under the pressure of the plagues, but rather that I will, so to speak, dull his brain so that he does not develop his intellectual capacity.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1284"><sup>77</sup> So J.P.S. However, the next verse renders <italic>ye&#x2019;or</italic> as river. River is a better translation as it refers to the Nile.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1285"><sup>78</sup> Hence the Bible speaks of <italic>naharotam</italic> (their rivers).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1286"><sup>79</sup> While the Nile runs only through the middle of the country.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1287"><sup>80</sup> So J.P.S. According to I.E., their rivers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1288"><sup>81</sup> There is only one Nile (<italic>ye&#x2019;or</italic>) in Egypt. Why then is the plural <italic>ye&#x2019;orehem</italic> employed?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1289"><sup>82</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s comment pertains to the word <italic>meyemehem</italic> (of their water).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1290"><sup>83</sup> The Jordan&#x2019;s waters are sweet. We thus see that <italic>me</italic> refers also to sweet water.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1291"><sup>84</sup> Even when it refers to the singular, the plural is used.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1292"><sup>85</sup> We rather say <italic>meyemai and meyemeha.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1293"><sup>86</sup> But never the double form <italic>meme.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1294"><sup>87</sup> The verb governing <italic>zorak</italic> (dashed) is singular. Hence <italic>me</italic> too is in the singular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1295"><sup>88</sup> See note 77.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1296"><sup>89</sup> From the root <italic>lamed, vav, tet</italic>, meaning to envelop, to cover, i.e., to do something secretly. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>be-latehem</italic> is not to be confused with <italic>be-lahatehem</italic> in verse 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1297"><sup>90</sup> New J.P.S. translation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1298"><sup>91</sup> In which case its root would be <italic>lamed, heh, tet</italic>, for the <italic>heh</italic> would be implied in the <italic>pattach</italic> sound and <italic>be-lahtehem</italic> would thus be a variant of <italic>be-lahatehem</italic> in verse 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1299"><sup>92</sup> It is only an implied letter at the end of a word. For the meaning of an implied letter see the notes to I.E. on Ex. 3:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1300"><sup>93</sup> The Egyptians dug for water to drink. See verse 24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1301"><sup>94</sup> Into blood. The point is that Aaron transformed both the water that he saw (the Nile) and the water which he did not see into blood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1302"><sup>95</sup> <italic>Prima facie, even this</italic> seems out of place, for this was the first plague.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1303"><sup>96</sup> Which did not convince Pharaoh to set Israel free. Hence Scripture states, <italic>even this</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1304"><sup>97</sup> In other words, the plague of blood did not affect the Israelites. The very same water that was red in the hands of an Egyptian turned normal in the hands of an Israelite and vice versa. Cf. <italic>Shemot Rabba</italic> 9:9.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1315"><sup>108</sup> For water (v. 24).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1316"><sup>109</sup> For water. We must assume this, as the plague of blood struck them as well.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 8</title>
<p>1. AND THE LORD SAID&#x2026;STRETCH FORTH THY HAND. Towards the four corners of heaven<sup><xref rid="fn1328">1</xref></sup> and the frogs will arise from the canals, from the rivers, and from the pools. However, they will not arise from all gatherings of water.<sup><xref rid="fn1329">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND AARON STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND. Behold, Aaron merely stretched forth his hand but did not strike the water as he did the first time.<sup><xref rid="fn1330">3</xref></sup> He merely indicated that the frogs could arise from the moment that he stretched out his hand.</p>
<p>3. AND THE MAGICIANS DID IN LIKE MANNER. In the little water.<sup><xref rid="fn1331">4</xref></sup> Pharaoh therefore saw that there was a difference between what Aaron did and what his magicians were able to do. He called Moses because he saw that his magicians could add to the plague<sup><xref rid="fn1332">5</xref></sup> but were unable to mitigate it.</p>
<p>4. THEN PHARAOH CALLED. Pharaoh employed the plural form for entreat (<italic>hatiru</italic>) out of respect for Moses and Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn1333">6</xref></sup> This plague was worse than the first one, for we read, <italic>He sent among them&#x2026;frogs, which destroyed them</italic> (Ps. 78:45).<sup><xref rid="fn1334">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND MOSES SAID UNTO PHARAOH: HAVE THOU THIS GLORY OVER ME. I will glorify you by entreating the Lord that He take away the plague on a day that you yourself shall designate.</p>
<p>[AND REMAIN IN THE RIVER ONLY.] The reason for mentioning the river is that this is where the frogs started from. Once Scripture notes <italic>the river</italic> there is no need to mention the canals and pools.<sup><xref rid="fn1335">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND HE SAID: AGAINST TOMORROW. Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni<sup><xref rid="fn1336">9</xref></sup> says that people usually pray that a plague be removed from them immediately.<sup><xref rid="fn1337">10</xref></sup> Pharaoh, however, thought that the plague of frogs resulted from an unpropitious conjunction of heavenly bodies which Moses knew about.<sup><xref rid="fn1338">11</xref></sup> He thought that the time for the removal of the frogs had now come.<sup><xref rid="fn1339">12</xref></sup> Therefore Pharaoh tested Moses by asking him to extend the plague and said, <italic>Against tomorrow</italic>.</p>
<p>7. AND THE FROGS SHALL DEPART. <italic>Ve-saru</italic> (shall depart) is ultimately accented, contrary to the rules of grammar.<sup><xref rid="fn1340">13</xref></sup> We find the same irregularity in the word <italic>samu</italic> (they put) in <italic>that they should put me into the dungeon</italic> (Gen. 40:15).</p>
<p>8. AND MOSES AND AARON WENT OUT. <italic>Moses cried unto the Lord</italic> because he trusted that the Lord would not put him to shame. Out of his own accord and without the permission of God, he had told Pharaoh, <italic>Be it according to thy word</italic>.</p>
<p>9. AND THE LORD DID ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF MOSES. Which he had spoken of his own accord.</p>
<p>10. AND THEY GATHERED. <italic>Va-yitzberu</italic> (and they gathered) is similar in meaning to the word <italic>va-yitzbor</italic> (laid up) in <italic>And Joseph laid up corn</italic> (Gen. 41:49).</p>
<p>HEAPS. <italic>Chomarim chomarim</italic> (heaps) is similar in meaning to <italic>chamor chamoratayim</italic> (heaps upon heaps) (Jud. 15:16).</p>
<p>11. BUT WHEN PHARAOH SAW THAT THERE WAS RESPITE. The word <italic>harevachah</italic> (respite) is similar in meaning to <italic>ve-ravach</italic> (relief) in <italic>so Saul found relief</italic> (Jud. 16:23).</p>
<p>HE HARDENED HIS HEART. Scripture employs an infinitive (<italic>hakhbed</italic>) in place of a perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn1341">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND THE LORD SAID. Note that the first three plagues and signs which Aaron brought about pertained to the lowest elements,<sup><xref rid="fn1342">15</xref></sup> as I have explained previously, since two were related to water and one to the dust of the earth. However, the plagues brought about by Moses with his rod related to a higher element. This was so because Moses was on a higher plane than Aaron. Thus the hail and the locusts were brought by the wind, and the darkness was in the air.<sup><xref rid="fn1343">16</xref></sup> Moses also brought about the plague of boils.<sup><xref rid="fn1344">17</xref></sup> However, three plagues came about without the use of the rod, namely, the swarms of beasts, murrain, and the death of the first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn1345">18</xref></sup> One plague, that of the boils, was brought about by Moses with Aaron&#x2019;s minor participation and without the use of the rod.</p>
<p>[THAT IT MAY BECOME GNATS THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT.] This is similar in meaning to <italic>And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt</italic> (Ex. 9:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1346">19</xref></sup> The dust which Aaron struck gave birth, as it were, to gnats which went up over all the land of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn1347">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND THEY DID SO. <italic>And they did</italic> refers to Moses and Aaron. Moses is included because he told Aaron to smite the dust with the rod. Our verse is similar to <italic>and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand</italic> (Ex. 17:5).</p>
<p>AND THERE WERE GNATS. <italic>Kinnam</italic> (gnats) is a generic name.<sup><xref rid="fn1348">21</xref></sup> The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>kinnam</italic> is either superfluous or in place of a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1349">22</xref></sup> In any case, it is not a root letter. The <italic>mem</italic> sometimes serves as the sign of the feminine plural, as in the word <italic>tzefardi&#x2019;im</italic> (frogs). This term is a feminine, for when referring to the singular Scripture reads, <italic>va-ta&#x2019;al ha-tzefarde&#x2019;a</italic> (and the frog came up) (Ex. 8:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1350">23</xref></sup> The term <italic>kinnim</italic> is proof of the aforementioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1351">24</xref></sup> According to this interpretation the word <italic>ha-kinnam</italic> is irregular because of its superfluous <italic>mem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1352">25</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>rekam</italic> (empty) and <italic>chinnam</italic> (gratuitous).<sup><xref rid="fn1353">26</xref></sup> However, Yefet says that the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>kinnam</italic> is a pronominal suffix relating to the Egyptians.<sup><xref rid="fn1354">27</xref></sup> He claims that the singular of <italic>kinnim</italic> (gnats) is <italic>kan</italic>, in the same way that the singular of <italic>pittim</italic> (morsels) is <italic>pat</italic> (morsel). He also says that the word <italic>ha-kinnam</italic> is similar to the word <italic>ha-oholi</italic> (my tent) (Josh. 7:21).<sup><xref rid="fn1355">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Do not be amazed that Scripture records that after one spot was struck, <italic>all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1356">29</xref></sup> Its meaning is that the plague then started.<sup><xref rid="fn1357">30</xref></sup> The same is true regarding the plagues of the water<sup><xref rid="fn1358">31</xref></sup> and the boils.<sup><xref rid="fn1359">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THE MAGICIANS DID SO. They struck the dust of the earth.</p>
<p>TO BRING FORTH GNATS. To cause the earth to bring forth gnats as Aaron did. However, they could not do so.</p>
<p>[AND THERE WERE GNATS UPON MAN, AND UPON BEAST.] Scripture notes this a second time because the plague was also upon the magicians.</p>
<p>15. THEN THE MAGICIANS SAID. When the magicians saw that unlike the changing of the rod into a serpent and the plague of blood and frogs where they were able to duplicate Aaron&#x2019;s actions they were now unable to imitate what Aaron had done, they said to Pharaoh that this plague did not come to liberate Israel but was a disaster sent by God in keeping with the arrangements of the stars dealing with Egypt&#x2019;s fortune. I have previously explained that Pharaoh did not deny the existence of a Creator.<sup><xref rid="fn1360">33</xref></sup> He only denied the existence of the God which Moses revealed to him. Our verse is explained by, <italic>it is not His hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us</italic> (I Sam. 6:9) from heaven. Hence Pharaoh&#x2019;s heart was hardened. Our interpretation is supported by the fact that the magicians said, <italic>This is the finger of God</italic>, and not, this is the finger of the Lord, meaning the God of Israel, as Pharaoh did when he exclaimed, <italic>Entreat the Lord</italic>, with regard to the plague of frogs and then similarly used this term for God in the latter plagues.<sup><xref rid="fn1361">34</xref></sup> Furthermore, Moses told Pharaoh that the Nile would be stricken before it was actually plagued, and he likewise informed him that the land would be inundated by frogs before they appeared. However, Moses did not inform Pharaoh that a plague of gnats was about to strike.<sup><xref rid="fn1362">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THE LORD SAID. It is the custom of kings to go out to the river in the morning, for it is good for the eyes to see water.</p>
<p>17. I WILL SEND. The word <italic>mashli&#x2019;ach</italic> (I will send) is in the <italic>hifil</italic>. It is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn1363">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>[SWARMS OF FLIES.] The word <italic>arov</italic> (swarms of flies) refers to a mixture of evil beasts such as lions, wolves, bears, and leopards.<sup><xref rid="fn1364">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND ALSO THE GROUND.] Uninhabited places.</p>
<p>18. AND I WILL SET APART. Some say that the word <italic>ve-hifleti</italic> (and I will set apart) is missing an <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1365">38</xref></sup> However, I believe that it comes from a root ending in a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1366">39</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ve-hifleti</italic> is, and I will set apart. It is logical to assume that Pharaoh now started to lighten Israel&#x2019;s burden. When he saw that the Lord put a division between Israel and Egypt he feared to harm them. He now saw the need to send them to offer sacrifices to the Lord, <italic>lest he fall upon us with pestilence</italic> (Ex. 5:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1367">40</xref></sup> Don&#x2019;t you see that he now gave them permission to sacrifice to the Lord in the land of Egypt?<sup><xref rid="fn1368">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT I AM THE LORD IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH.] This is a metaphor. It is the manner of kings to establish their residences in the middle of their kingdoms so as to be equidistant to their borders. The Lord similarly placed the heart, which is &#x201C;king&#x201D; over man&#x2019;s body, in the center of the human corporeal frame. Man&#x2019;s spirit too is located in the center of the body, as it is written, <italic>And (the Lord) formed the spirit of man in the midst of him</italic> (Zech. 12:1).<sup><xref rid="fn1369">42</xref></sup> There are many proofs from nature that this is so. Scripture states, <italic>Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth</italic> (Ps. 50:2) because Zion is in the center of the inhabited world and God&#x2019;s presence is seen in the inhabited world.<sup><xref rid="fn1370">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND I WILL PUT A DIVISION. The meaning of <italic>pedut</italic> is a division. The word <italic>pidyon</italic> (redemption) is always similar in meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn1371">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND THE LORD DID SO. On the morrow, as Moses had spoken.<sup><xref rid="fn1372">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND THERE CAME GRIEVOUS SWARMS.] By themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn1373">46</xref></sup> This plague was worse than any of the previous plagues.</p>
<p>21. AND PHARAOH CALLED. It was now clear to Pharaoh that the plagues came because the children of Israel did not offer sacrifices unto the Lord.</p>
<p>[IN THE LAND.] In his kingdom and not in any other place.</p>
<p>22. AND MOSES SAID. Rabbi Joshua says that the clause <italic>the abomination of the Egyptians</italic> was written to disparage idol worship. What Moses actually said to Pharaoh was, &#x201C;the god of the Egyptians.&#x201D; Rabbi Joshua further states that the god of Egypt was shaped like a lamb because the Egyptians believed that the constellation of the lamb ruled over their land. It is because of this that the Egyptians did not eat meat. However, if the reason for the Egyptians not eating meat was their worship of the lamb why did they also abstain from ox and goat meat?</p>
<p>I believe that the ancient Egyptians in the time of Moses had the same belief currently held by the people of India, who make up more than half of the world. All of them are descendants of Ham.<sup><xref rid="fn1374">47</xref></sup> They do not eat meat until this very day. These people also do not drink milk or blood or eat fish or eggs. In other words, they do not eat anything coming from a living creature. Furthermore, they abhor any person who eats any of the aforementioned. They consider shepherding to be an especially disgusting type of work. It is similarly written, <italic>for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians</italic> (Gen. 47:34).</p>
<p>They also do not allow any meat-eating person in their country. If any of them goes to a foreign country he will flee from any place where flesh is eaten. They will not eat anything which a meat-eater has handled. They consider his very garments unclean. It is thus written, <italic>because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews</italic> (Gen. 43:32). Behold, Potiphar placed everything with the exception of the food which he ate under the care of Joseph, who was then living in his house. Potiphar would not permit him to touch his food because Joseph was a Hebrew. There is no reason to ask, &#x201C;If this is so, then why did the Egyptians keep cattle?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1375">48</xref></sup> We find the same to be the case in contemporary India. Horses, asses, and camels were used to carry burdens and for riding. Cattle served to pull the plow and sheep were kept for their wool. I will yet speak on this when I discuss the Passover observed in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn1376">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yefet says that an interrogative <italic>heh</italic> is missing in the phrase <italic>ve-lo yiskelunu</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1377">50</xref></sup> for its meaning is, will they not stone us.<sup><xref rid="fn1378">51</xref></sup> However, I believe that the word <italic>hen</italic> (lo) in <italic>hen nizbach</italic> (lo, we sacrifice)<sup><xref rid="fn1379">52</xref></sup> has the same meaning as the interrogative <italic>heh.</italic> The meaning of our verse thus is: if we sacrifice (<italic>hen nizbach</italic>) the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us? The word <italic>hen</italic> in <italic>hen hayetah ka-zot</italic> (if there hath been such a thing) (Jer. 2:10) is identical.<sup><xref rid="fn1380">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. WE WILL GO THREE DAYS&#x2019; JOURNEY INTO THE WILDERNESS. We must remove ourselves from the Egyptians.</p>
<p>[AS HE SHALL COMMAND US.] Regarding the type and number of animals to be selected as sacrificial victims.</p>
<p>24. AND PHARAOH SAID. The phrase <italic>entreat for me</italic> should have been placed at the beginning of the verse,<sup><xref rid="fn1381">54</xref></sup> as the verse means entreat for me that this plague will be removed and I will let you go to sacrifice in the wilderness as you asked. However, this is on the condition that you go no further than three days&#x2019; journey into the desert.</p>
<p>25. AND MOSES SAID&#x2026;ONLY LET NOT PHARAOH DEAL DECEITFULLY. The word <italic>hetel</italic> (deal deceitfully) is irregular. A <italic>dagesh</italic> should have been placed in the <italic>tav</italic>, for its <italic>heh</italic> is a root letter. It should have been vocalized like the word <italic>dabber</italic> (speak) in <italic>behold, I cannot speak</italic> (Jer. 1:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1382">55</xref></sup> We find the same irregularity in <italic>hatel tehatellu vo</italic> (mock, will ye mock him) (Job 13:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1383">56</xref></sup> The correct vocalization of this word is found in the clause <italic>va-yehattel ba-hem eliyahu</italic> (that Elijah mocked them) (I Kings 18:27).<sup><xref rid="fn1384">57</xref></sup> Moses said, <italic>only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more</italic>, because he had promised to let the people go during the plague of the frogs and then didn&#x2019;t.</p>
<p>26. AND MOSES WENT OUT. There are words in Hebrew that have the same meaning in the <italic>kal</italic> and <italic>hifil.</italic> These words come in two forms with one meaning. Examples are: <italic>va-yetar</italic> (and entreated) in <italic>and entreated the Lord</italic> and <italic>ve-hatarti</italic> (and I will entreat) in <italic>and I will entreat the Lord</italic> (v. 25).<sup><xref rid="fn1385">58</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>moreh</italic> (shoot) and <italic>yarah</italic> (shot) in <italic>which I shoot</italic> and <italic>he shot an arrow</italic> (I Sam. 20:36).<sup><xref rid="fn1386">59</xref></sup> However, such words are rare.</p>
<p>27. AND THE LORD DID. The word <italic>va-yasar</italic> (and he removed) is grammatically irregular. Roots having a <italic>vav</italic> as their middle letter<sup><xref rid="fn1387">60</xref></sup> are vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath their first stem letter, i.e., <italic>va-yashav</italic> (and he returned)<sup><xref rid="fn1388">61</xref></sup> and <italic>va-yakam</italic> (and he got up).<sup><xref rid="fn1389">62</xref></sup> However, in cases where the last letter of the root cannot receive a <italic>dagesh</italic>, i.e., if it is a <italic>chet, ayin</italic>, or <italic>resh</italic>, then the first root letter is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1390">63</xref></sup> as in <italic>va-yanach</italic> (and rested)<sup><xref rid="fn1391">64</xref></sup> in <italic>and rested on the seventh day</italic> (Ex. 20:11); <italic>va-yana</italic> (was moved)<sup><xref rid="fn1392">65</xref></sup> in <italic>and his heart was moved</italic> (Is. 7:2); <italic>va-yasar</italic> (and he turned) in <italic>And he turned in unto her</italic> (Jud. 4:18). All of the aforementioned applies to words in the <italic>kal</italic>, because in the <italic>hifil</italic> roots having a <italic>vav</italic> as their middle letter are vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic> beneath their first stem letters in cases where their roots do not end in the letters mentioned above.<sup><xref rid="fn1393">66</xref></sup> An example of the aforementioned is <italic>va-yashev</italic> (and he brought back) in <italic>And he brought back all the goods</italic> (Gen. 14:16). Now <italic>and he removed</italic> is written <italic>va-yasar</italic> rather than <italic>va-yaser</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1394">67</xref></sup> It is like <italic>va-yasar</italic> (and he took off) in <italic>And he took off their chariot wheels</italic> (Ex. 14:25). However, it appears that <italic>va-yasar</italic> is a <italic>kal</italic> and that <italic>va-yasar he-arov</italic> (and He removed the swarms of flies) means: and the swarms of flies departed.<sup><xref rid="fn1395">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AND PHARAOH HARDENED HIS HEART. He hardened his heart as he did at the plague of the frogs wherein it is written: <italic>he hardened his heart</italic> (v. 11).</p>
<ftnote id="fn1328"><sup>1</sup> The passage is to be interpreted, stretch forth thy rod with thy hand towards heaven so that a plague will descend upon the rivers, canals, and pools. I.E. interprets thus because he believed it unlikely that the Lord would ask Aaron to put forth his hand over every river, canal, and pool in the land of Egypt (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1329"><sup>2</sup> Unlike the plague of blood, which struck all gatherings of water (Ex. 7:19), the plague of frogs was limited to rivers, pools, and canals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1330"><sup>3</sup> At the plague of blood. See Ex. 7:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1331"><sup>4</sup> Which they brought. The magicians could only bring forth frogs from the pans of water which they brought before Pharaoh, whereas Aaron caused frogs to swarm in all of the canals, pools, and rivers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1332"><sup>5</sup> They could bring forth additional frogs from the water they brought but could not do anything to remove the frogs from the rivers, streams, and canals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1333"><sup>6</sup> Pharaoh knew that it was Moses who would pray to God to have the frogs removed. He used the plural and thereby included Aaron in his plea, out of deference to Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1334"><sup>7</sup> Psalms does not say the same with regard to the plague of blood. It states, <italic>And turned their rivers into blood, So that they could not drink their streams</italic> (Ps. 78:44). It does not say that the plague of blood destroyed them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1335"><sup>8</sup> The point of our verse is that the frogs remained in their natural habitat. <italic>The river</italic> is mentioned merely as an example of the aforementioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1336"><sup>9</sup> See chapter 4, note 135.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1337"><sup>10</sup> I.E. was troubled by Pharaoh requesting that the plague be removed on the next day, hence this comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1338"><sup>11</sup> And exploited for his benefit. Pharaoh did not believe that Moses had brought the plague. He thought that it was a natural occurrence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1339"><sup>12</sup> On the day that he spoke to Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1340"><sup>13</sup> According to the rules of Hebrew grammar it should have been penultimately accented.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1341"><sup>14</sup> In view of the fact that our verse deals with the past, Scripture should read <italic>hikhbid</italic> (he hardened) rather than <italic>hakhbed</italic> (to harden), as the former is a perfect and the latter an infinitive. I.E. points out that Scripture occasionally uses an infinitive with the meaning of a perfect. As to the question of free will, see I.E. on Ex. 7:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1342"><sup>15</sup> For the four elements, see Vol. 1, p. 74, note 53.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1343"><sup>16</sup> Air (wind) was believed to be a higher element.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1344"><sup>17</sup> It was Moses who threw the soot of the furnace heavenward and caused boils to break out upon man and beast. See Ex. 9:10. This plague entailed the element of air.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1345"><sup>18</sup> These three plagues did not entail any interaction with any of the elements. Thus Aaron brought three plagues via the rod, i.e., blood, frogs, and gnats. Moses similarly brought three plagues via the use of the rod, i.e., hail, locusts, and darkness. One plague was brought jointly by Moses and Aaron without the use of the rod, i.e., the plague of boils. Three other plagues came about without any action by Moses and Aaron, i.e., the swarms of beasts, (J.P.S. renders swarms of flies), murrain, and the death of the first-born.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1346"><sup>19</sup> The <italic>lamed</italic> prefixed to <italic>kinnim</italic> does not mean to, but for, i.e.; <italic>le-kinnim</italic> does not mean to gnats but for gnats, that is, so that gnats will result. Similarly, <italic>le-afar</italic> does not mean to dust but for dust, i.e., so that dust will result. I.E. comments thus because the <italic>lamed</italic> usually has the meaning of to.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1347"><sup>20</sup> Our verse does not teach that the dust literally turned into gnats. It only seemed so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1348"><sup>21</sup> The word <italic>kinnam</italic> presents a problem. The Hebrew word for gnat is <italic>kinnah</italic>; for gnats, <italic>kinnim</italic>. Hence our verse should have read <italic>kinnim</italic> or <italic>kinnah</italic> if a collective noun were employed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1349"><sup>22</sup> I.E. suggests that our verse employs a collective noun and that the word for gnat is <italic>ken</italic> (a variant of <italic>kinnah</italic>), the <italic>mem</italic> in <italic>kinnam</italic> being superfluous. He then suggests that the word for gnat is <italic>kinnah</italic>, with a <italic>mem</italic> substituted for a <italic>heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1350"><sup>23</sup> <italic>Va-ta&#x2019;al</italic> (came up) is a feminine verb. Thus <italic>tzefarde&#x2019;a</italic> (frog), the noun which it governs, must also be feminine. Hence <italic>tzefardi&#x2019;im</italic> (frogs) is a feminine plural. I.E. makes note of this because a <italic>mem</italic> suffixed to a noun usually indicates that a word is a masculine plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1351"><sup>24</sup> That the <italic>mem</italic> of kinnam is not a root letter, for the plural of <italic>kinnah</italic>. is <italic>kinnim</italic>, not <italic>kinnamim</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1352"><sup>25</sup> For the usual word for gnat is <italic>kinnah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1353"><sup>26</sup> See Vol. 1, p. 306.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1354"><sup>27</sup> In other words, <italic>kinnam</italic> (gnats) means their gnats, for <italic>kinnam</italic> is a combination of the noun <italic>ken</italic> (gnat) and the pronoun <italic>she-lahem</italic> (their).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1355"><sup>28</sup> Words that result from the combination of a noun and a pronoun do not usually have the definite article (<italic>ha</italic>) prefixed to it. Thus <italic>prima facie, ha-kinnam</italic> cannot mean their gnats. Hence Yefet points out that we occasionally do find the definite article prefixed to a noun combined with a pronoun, as in the word <italic>ha-oholi</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1356"><sup>29</sup> I.E. assumes that this would strain some people&#x2019;s credulity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1357"><sup>30</sup> In other words, <italic>all the dust of the earth</italic> did not turn to gnats the moment Aaron struck the earth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1358"><sup>31</sup> All the rivers, streams, pools, and ponds of Egypt did not turn into blood the moment Aaron <italic>smote the waters that were in the river</italic> (Ex. 7:20).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1359"><sup>32</sup> The boils did not break out upon all men and beasts the moment Moses threw the soot heavenward.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1360"><sup>33</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 5:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1361"><sup>34</sup> When Pharaoh finally acknowledged that the plagues were sent by the God of Israel, he used the term Lord (<italic>Adonai</italic>) rather than <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) for the Deity. <italic>Adonai</italic> is the Lord&#x2019;s proper name. <italic>Elohim</italic> is a generic name and in the Bible often refers to idols.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1362"><sup>35</sup> Hence the magicians could argue that the gnats were not sent by the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1363"><sup>36</sup> The usual term for I will send, as used in our verse, is <italic>meshale&#x2019;ach</italic> in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1364"><sup>37</sup> The word <italic>arov</italic>, translated by J.P.S. as swarms of flies, comes from the root <italic>ayin, resh, bet</italic>, meaning to mingle. According to I.E. it means a mixture of wild animals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1365"><sup>38</sup> It comes from the root <italic>peh, lamed, alef</italic>. There is no <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>ve-hifleti</italic>, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1366"><sup>39</sup> Its root is <italic>peh, lamed, heh.</italic> Hence there is no <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>ve-hifleti</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1367"><sup>40</sup> <italic>Lest he fall upon us with pestilence</italic> was first uttered by the Israelites. However, it also referred to Pharaoh. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Ex. 5:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1368"><sup>41</sup> Which shows that Pharaoh now started to make concessions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1369"><sup>42</sup> I.E. believed that man&#x2019;s soul is located in the heart, which is in the center of the body. He held that Zech. 12:1 supports this contention.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1370"><sup>43</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 1:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1371"><sup>44</sup> To be redeemed means to be separated from ones enemies. Both <italic>pedut</italic> and <italic>pidyon</italic> come from the root <italic>peh, dalet, heh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1372"><sup>45</sup> I.E. assumes that the swarms came the day after Moses had warned Pharaoh of their coming. They did not come immediately because God wanted to give Pharaoh a chance to repent (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1373"><sup>46</sup> Moses threatened <italic>a swarm</italic> of beasts (or flies). The Pentateuch tells us that <italic>a grievous swarm</italic> came. Hence I.E. notes that the grievous swarm came of itself; i.e., it was worse than what Moses threatened (Krinsky). That is, they were more numerous and/or more harmful.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1374"><sup>47</sup> As are the Egyptians.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1375"><sup>48</sup> The Pentateuch tells us that the Egyptians kept cattle. See Ex. 9:3 and many other verses in this chapter which relate the same.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1376"><sup>49</sup> Ex. 12:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1377"><sup>50</sup> <italic>Ve-lo yiskelunu</italic> (will they not stone us) literally means: and they will not stone us. For the clause to mean &#x201C;(and) will they not stone us&#x201D; it should read: <italic>ve-ha-lo yiskelunu</italic>; i e., an interrogative <italic>heh</italic> should be placed before the word <italic>lo</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1378"><sup>51</sup> The context implies that it is to be so translated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1379"><sup>52</sup> Hence there is no need to place an interrogative <italic>heh</italic> before the word <italic>hen</italic> (lo). J.P.S. translates: lo, if we sacrifice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1380"><sup>53</sup> There too <italic>hen</italic> is in place of the interrogative <italic>heh</italic>, for the meaning of <italic>hen hayetah</italic> is: if there had been, not lo, there had been. The word <italic>hen</italic> can mean lo, behold, or if.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1381"><sup>54</sup> Rather than at the end of the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1382"><sup>55</sup> The word <italic>hetel</italic> is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>. Hence it should follow the paradigm of <italic>dabber</italic>, which is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> and should be vocalized <italic>hattel</italic>. Since the word is not so vocalized it is irregular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1383"><sup>56</sup> I.E. has abridged the clause. Job 13:9 reads: <italic>Or as one mocketh a man, will ye mock Him</italic>? Cf. Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1384"><sup>57</sup> The word is there vocalized in the usual <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> form <italic>va-yehattel</italic>. Compare, <italic>va-yedabber</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1385"><sup>58</sup> The same root in a variant conjugation usually has a different though related meaning, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. <italic>Va-yetar</italic> is a <italic>kal; ve-hatarti</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1386"><sup>59</sup> <italic>Moreh</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic>. <italic>Yarah</italic> is a <italic>kal</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1387"><sup>60</sup> The root of <italic>va-yasar</italic> is <italic>samekh, vav, resh</italic>.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 9</title>
<p>1. GO IN UNTO PHARAOH. To his palace.</p>
<p>Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi says that two plagues were in the water: one, that it turned red and the fish died; two, that frogs arose from it.<sup><xref rid="fn1396">1</xref></sup> Two plagues were on the earth:<sup><xref rid="fn1397">2</xref></sup> one of gnats and the second the swarms, which were an assortment of wild animals. And it is written, <italic>Let the earth bring forth the living creature</italic> (Gen. 1:24).<sup><xref rid="fn1398">3</xref></sup> There were likewise two plagues in the air.<sup><xref rid="fn1399">4</xref></sup> Murrain<sup><xref rid="fn1400">5</xref></sup> is nothing but a change from the normal in the air&#x2019;s heat or cold. This change causes an untold number to die in an instant, as the spirit of life which resides in the heart depends on the air.<sup><xref rid="fn1401">6</xref></sup> The second plague<sup><xref rid="fn1402">7</xref></sup> was the boils. Scripture refers to the firmament which is above their heads as the heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn1403">8</xref></sup> The seventh plague<sup><xref rid="fn1404">9</xref></sup> was a mixture of the sphere of the whirlwind<sup><xref rid="fn1405">10</xref></sup> and the sphere of fire.<sup><xref rid="fn1406">11</xref></sup> It is thus written, <italic>and fire flashing up amidst the hail</italic> (v. 24). The eighth was the plague of locusts which the wind brought from afar. The ninth was a wonderful plague in that the light from the two great luminaries and the stars was absent from above the land of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn1407">12</xref></sup> The tenth was the descent of the destroyer from the spheres of the glory<sup><xref rid="fn1408">13</xref></sup> to kill the first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn1409">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND WILL HOLD THEM STILL. The word hand or something similar<sup><xref rid="fn1410">15</xref></sup> has been omitted.<sup><xref rid="fn1411">16</xref></sup> <italic>One that holdeth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1412">17</xref></sup> <italic>a dog by the ears</italic> (Prov. 26:17) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1413">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. BEHOLD, THE HAND OF THE LORD IS UPON. Observe, we find that a <italic>yod</italic> interchanges with a <italic>vav</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1414">19</xref></sup> as elsewhere we read, <italic>and thou wouldest be</italic> (hoveh) <italic>their king</italic> (Neh. 6:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1415">20</xref></sup> The opposite is the case with the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>kovai</italic> (that wait for me)<sup><xref rid="fn1416">21</xref></sup> in <italic>For they shall not be ashamed that wait for Me</italic> (Is. 49:23) which interchanges with a <italic>yod</italic> in the word <italic>ve-kove</italic> (but they that wait)<sup><xref rid="fn1417">22</xref></sup> in <italic>But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength</italic> (Is. 40:31).</p>
<p>The word <italic>dever</italic> (murrain) is a collective noun.<sup><xref rid="fn1418">23</xref></sup> Its verbal form<sup><xref rid="fn1419">24</xref></sup> is found employed only once, in <italic>va-tedabber</italic> (she destroyed) in <italic>she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah</italic> (II Chron. 22:10). The book of Kings<sup><xref rid="fn1420">25</xref></sup> reads, <italic>va-te&#x2019;abed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1421">26</xref></sup> (and she destroyed) (II Kings 11:1). This interpretation is far-fetched.<sup><xref rid="fn1422">27</xref></sup> However, we know of no better one.<sup><xref rid="fn1423">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND THE LORD SHALL MAKE A DIVISION&#x2026;NOTHING. The word <italic>davar</italic> (nothing)<sup><xref rid="fn1424">29</xref></sup> is used in reference to many words joined together, as in <italic>ha-davar</italic> (the word)<sup><xref rid="fn1425">30</xref></sup> in <italic>The word that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah</italic> (Jer. 46:13). It is also used in reference to a thing, as in our verse. <italic>Davar</italic> in <italic>thou hast not lacked a thing</italic> is similar (Deut. 2:7).</p>
<p>5. AND THE LORD APPOINTED. He set a fixed time for the sign to begin.<sup><xref rid="fn1426">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND THE LORD DID. The meaning of <italic>and all</italic> (kol) <italic>the cattle of Egypt died</italic> is, that most of the cattle of Egypt died. For behold, it is written,<sup><xref rid="fn1427">32</xref></sup> <italic>Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle</italic> (v. 19).<sup><xref rid="fn1428">33</xref></sup> We find the same with regard to the plague of hail.<sup><xref rid="fn1429">34</xref></sup> Scripture reads, <italic>and the hail smote every herb of the field</italic> (v. 25). The plague of locusts concerning which it is written, <italic>and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail</italic> (Ex. 10:5) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1430">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. SO MUCH AS ONE. <italic>Ad echad</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1431">36</xref></sup> means, as I will explain in the song of Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn1432">37</xref></sup> <italic>so much as one</italic>. The meaning of our verse is: even though Pharaoh sent agents and saw that God loves Israel and on their account smote his flocks,<sup><xref rid="fn1433">38</xref></sup> he was not so bothered by the death of the flocks during this plague as to let Israel go. Perhaps the plague did not last a long time.<sup><xref rid="fn1434">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND IT SHALL BECOME. This was miraculous, that this small amount of soot turned into dust all over the land of Egypt. This plague did not separate out the Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn1435">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>BLAINS. The <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>avabu&#x2019;ot</italic> (blains) is superfluous, as <italic>avabu&#x2019;ot</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>tiveh</italic> (to boil)<sup><xref rid="fn1436">41</xref></sup> in <italic>And the fire causeth the waters to boil</italic> (Is. 64:1). The word is doubled<sup><xref rid="fn1437">42</xref></sup> like the words <italic>teshasha&#x2019;u</italic> (shall be dandled)<sup><xref rid="fn1438">43</xref></sup> (Is. 66:12) and <italic>tesagsegi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1439">44</xref></sup> (thou didst make it to grow) (Is. 17:11).</p>
<p>10. AND THEY TOOK THE SOOT OF THE FURNACE. Each as earlier noted took handfuls of soot and Moses threw all of it heavenward.<sup><xref rid="fn1440">45</xref></sup> It is possible that the magicians were not smitten with the plague of frogs and swarms. Through their wisdom and their knowledge of natural law they searched for a way to gain a small respite.<sup><xref rid="fn1441">46</xref></sup> However, their knowledge now failed them, as Scripture tells us.<sup><xref rid="fn1442">47</xref></sup> Pharaoh did not ask Moses and Aaron to entreat the Lord<sup><xref rid="fn1443">48</xref></sup> because the plague did not last long. We cannot conclude from the plain meaning of the text that since the first plague lasted for seven days all the other plagues did so too. Additionally, we shall pursue the text of Scripture. It is known that the plague of murrain lasted for one hour<sup><xref rid="fn1444">49</xref></sup> and the plague of darkness for three days. There is no way to ascertain in which month Moses came and the plagues commenced.<sup><xref rid="fn1445">50</xref></sup> However, if our holy sages received this via tradition we accept and abide by it.<sup><xref rid="fn1446">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND THE LORD HARDENED THE HEART OF PHARAOH. He therefore did not request Moses to entreat the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn1447">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND THE LORD SAID. Scripture does not here note that Pharaoh went out unto the water.<sup><xref rid="fn1448">53</xref></sup> Perhaps he had another reason for rising early.</p>
<p>14. FOR. Scripture reads, <italic>all My plagues</italic> because thunder, hail, rain, and fire combined in this plague. We do not find Pharaoh to be as afraid of all the passing plagues as he was of this one.<sup><xref rid="fn1449">54</xref></sup> He also said,<sup><xref rid="fn1450">55</xref></sup> <italic>the Lord is righteous</italic> (v. 27).</p>
<p>[THAT THERE IS NONE LIKE ME IN ALL THE EARTH.] This was said<sup><xref rid="fn1451">56</xref></sup> in accordance with Egyptian belief that their gods had the power to harm or to benefit.</p>
<p>15. AND SMITTEN. <italic>Va-akh</italic> (and smitten) is missing a <italic>nun</italic>. It is like the word <italic>ve-at</italic> (though I was offering) in <italic>Though I was offering them food</italic> (Hos. 11:4). They are both the same. Their roots are <italic>nun, tet, heh</italic> and <italic>nun, kaf, heh</italic>.</p>
<p>[PESTILENCE.] Scripture reads, <italic>ba-dever</italic> (with pestilence)<sup><xref rid="fn1452">57</xref></sup> because it refers to the well-known pestilence. It means: I would have killed all of you along with your cattle with the pestilence with which I smote them.</p>
<p>16. BUT IN VERY DEED FOR THIS CAUSE<sup><xref rid="fn1453">58</xref></sup> HAVE I MADE THEE TO STAND. Scripture goes on to explain the meaning of <italic>zot</italic> (this). It means <italic>to show thee My power</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1454">59</xref></sup> <italic>And out of the midst thereof as the color of electrum, out of the midst of the fire</italic> (Ezek. 1:4) is similar. However, Yefet says that its meaning is, for this plague,<sup><xref rid="fn1455">60</xref></sup> the reference being to the plague of hail.<sup><xref rid="fn1456">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND THAT MY NAME MAY BE DECLARED THROUGHOUT ALL THE EARTH.] This does not refer to Pharaoh.<sup><xref rid="fn1457">62</xref></sup> On the contrary, the word <italic>sapper</italic> (be declared) is an infinitive like the word <italic>kabbed</italic> (promote)<sup><xref rid="fn1458">63</xref></sup> in <italic>for I will promote thee unto very great honor</italic> (Num. 22:17). Its meaning is not that Pharaoh will go all over the world to declare God&#x2019;s glory, but rather that God&#x2019;s name would be declared from generation to generation because of the signs which He performed.<sup><xref rid="fn1459">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AS YET EXALTEST THOU THYSELF AGAINST MY PEOPLE. <italic>Mistolel</italic> (exaltest) means praises. It comes from the same root as the word <italic>salseleha</italic> (extol her) in <italic>Extol her, and she will exalt thee</italic> (Prov. 4:8). Now even though its first root letter is doubled<sup><xref rid="fn1460">65</xref></sup> it still belongs among the double roots.<sup><xref rid="fn1461">66</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn1462">67</xref></sup> is similar to the word <italic>solu</italic> (extol)<sup><xref rid="fn1463">68</xref></sup> in <italic>Extol him that rideth upon the skies</italic> (Ps. 68:5). Likewise <italic>ve-gilgaltikha</italic> (and roll thee down)<sup><xref rid="fn1464">69</xref></sup> (Jer. 51:25) is similar to <italic>mitgolel</italic> (wallowing) (II Sam. 20:12) and <italic>golu</italic> (roll). However, Rabbi Merinus says that the meaning of <italic>mistolel</italic> (exaltest) is strengthens and comes from the same root as <italic>mesillot</italic> in <italic>And the king made of the sandalwood pillars</italic> (mesillot)<sup><xref rid="fn1465">70</xref></sup> <italic>for the house of the Lord</italic> (II Chron. 9:11). Elsewhere it is written, <italic>And the king made of the sandalwood pillars</italic> (misad)<sup><xref rid="fn1466">71</xref></sup> <italic>for the house of the Lord</italic> (I Kings 10:12).</p>
<p>18. I WILL CAUSE IT TO RAIN. It is well known that even today neither rain nor hail comes down upon the land of Egypt. There is no need to explain why this is so.<sup><xref rid="fn1467">72</xref></sup> The same is still true of many other places. It was because of this that the Egyptians were greatly afraid, for with the exception of something resembling dew, nothing<sup><xref rid="fn1468">73</xref></sup> rains down there.</p>
<p>19. SEND HASTEN. The word <italic>ha-ez</italic> (hasten) means make to flee<sup><xref rid="fn1469">74</xref></sup> or gather.<sup><xref rid="fn1470">75</xref></sup> <italic>He-izu</italic> (flee) in <italic>The inhabitants of Gebim flee to cover</italic> (Is. 10:31) is similar.</p>
<p>20. HE THAT FEARED&#x2026;MADE FLEE. On that very day.</p>
<p>21. AND HE THAT REGARDED NOT. There is a meaning in Arabic for the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>va-ya&#x2019;azov</italic> (left).<sup><xref rid="fn1471">76</xref></sup> However, it is not in our power to translate it into another language.<sup><xref rid="fn1472">77</xref></sup> <italic>Va-yissa</italic> (lifted up his eyes) in, <italic>On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes</italic> (Gen. 22:4) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1473">78</xref></sup> There are many other similar instances.</p>
<p>22. AND THE LORD SAID. From a strictly logical point of view it appears that the stretching forth of his hand was with his rod.<sup><xref rid="fn1474">79</xref></sup> Behold, it is written afterwards, <italic>And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1475">80</xref></sup> that is, in the air above. <italic>In the open firmament of heaven</italic> (Gen. 1:20) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1476">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND FIRE RAN DOWN. <italic>Va-tihalakh</italic> (ran down) is a <italic>kal</italic> form. It expresses going.</p>
<p>UNTO THE EARTH. Contrary to its nature, which is to go up.<sup><xref rid="fn1477">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND FIRE FLASHING UP AMIDST THE HAIL. A miracle within a miracle.<sup><xref rid="fn1478">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THE HAIL SMOTE. This was a very strong plague, for it killed man and beast and broke every tree of the field. However, God pitied them<sup><xref rid="fn1479">84</xref></sup> and their cattle. Moses did not mention this to Pharaoh<sup><xref rid="fn1480">85</xref></sup> because he saw that Pharaoh sent agents and learned that there was not even one of the cattle of the Israelites dead, and yet did not take this to heart.<sup><xref rid="fn1481">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND CALLED. Pharaoh said, I have sinned, because he was greatly afraid that he, as was told to him, would be destroyed by the pestilence.<sup><xref rid="fn1482">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. ENTREAT THE LORD. Pharaoh made mention of the glorious name<sup><xref rid="fn1483">88</xref></sup> and referred to <italic>kolot Elohim</italic> (noises from God) because he, as I have already noted, admitted to the existence of a Deity.<sup><xref rid="fn1484">89</xref></sup> Moses combined the proper and adjectival names and said, &#x201C;the Lord God&#x201D; (<italic>YHVH / Adonai Elohim</italic>) because Pharaoh did not employ the term <italic>kolot YHVH / Adonai</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1485">90</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>YHVH / Adonai Elohim</italic> is: the Lord alone is God. We never find Moses employing this phrase<sup><xref rid="fn1486">91</xref></sup> in the entire Torah. The term <italic>Adonai Elohim</italic> in <italic>O Lord God, Thou hast begun</italic> (Deut. 3:24) does not refute the aforementioned, as <italic>Adonai</italic> is written there with an <italic>alef, dalet</italic>. <sup><xref rid="fn1487">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND MOSES SAID UNTO HIM: AS SOON AS I AM GONE OUT OF THE CITY. The commentaries say that Moses was unable to spread forth his hands in Egypt because it was filled with idols.<sup><xref rid="fn1488">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT THE EARTH IS THE LORD&#x2019;S. Not yours.</p>
<p>30. BUT AS FOR THEE. Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn1489">94</xref></sup> says that the meaning of <italic>terem tire&#x2019;un</italic> (ye will not yet fear) is: you do not fear.<sup><xref rid="fn1490">95</xref></sup> He interprets <italic>terem yishkavu</italic> (but before they lay down) (Gen. 19:4) similarly.<sup><xref rid="fn1491">96</xref></sup> However, the meaning of this word is not as he imagined, as the subject always follows.<sup><xref rid="fn1492">97</xref></sup> Following <italic>terem yishkavu</italic> (but before they lay down) Scripture reads, <italic>the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round:</italic> its meaning is, at the time when they lay down they <italic>compassed the house round.</italic> The word <italic>terem</italic> (before) in <italic>before they call, I will answer</italic> (Is. 65:24) and <italic>terem</italic> (before) in <italic>Yea before the fat was made to smoke</italic> (I Sam. 2:15) are similar. The same applies to all times the word <italic>terem</italic> is used. Thus <italic>terem</italic> never has the meaning of no.<sup><xref rid="fn1493">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon of blessed memory connected the whole subject.<sup><xref rid="fn1494">99</xref></sup> He explained it as follows. Moses said to Pharaoh, I shall pray for the hail to be removed.<sup><xref rid="fn1495">100</xref></sup> However, what it destroyed, it destroyed.<sup><xref rid="fn1496">101</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>And the flax and the barley were smitten</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1497">102</xref></sup> is, the flax and barley shall not return<sup><xref rid="fn1498">103</xref></sup> and I shall not pray for their recovery.<sup><xref rid="fn1499">104</xref></sup> Behold, its meaning is,<sup><xref rid="fn1500">105</xref></sup> before you fear God and confess and say the Lord is righteous,<sup><xref rid="fn1501">106</xref></sup> the barley and flax shall already be smitten. This <italic>vav</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1502">107</xref></sup> as I have noted, is correctly used according to the Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn1503">108</xref></sup> However, in my opinion<sup><xref rid="fn1504">109</xref></sup> a word<sup><xref rid="fn1505">110</xref></sup> has been omitted,<sup><xref rid="fn1506">111</xref></sup> its interpretation being: before I spread my hands you will fear the Lord, viz., you and your servants. Moses was being polite. Its implication is, when the plague is removed you will rebel. Therefore Scripture notes afterwards, <italic>and</italic> (Pharaoh) <italic>hardened his heart, he and his servants</italic>. We do not find this in any other place.<sup><xref rid="fn1507">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND THE FLAX AND THE BARLEY. Scripture relates what happened.<sup><xref rid="fn1508">113</xref></sup> It is clear from the word <italic>nukkatah</italic> (were smitten) and also from the word <italic>nukku</italic> (were smitten) (v. 32)<sup><xref rid="fn1509">114</xref></sup> that the root of <italic>makkeh</italic> (smite) is <italic>nun, kaf, heh</italic>. It is similar to the words <italic>shuppu</italic> (corrode) and <italic>ru&#x2019;u</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1510">115</xref></sup> (unsightliness) in <italic>And his bones corrode to unsightliness</italic> (Job 33:21).</p>
<p>32. THEY RIPEN LATE. <italic>Afilot</italic> (ripen late) is an adjective. The word <italic>afel</italic> (darkness), as in, <italic>darkness, and not light</italic>, is close in meaning to it. It means that they were beneath the earth<sup><xref rid="fn1511">116</xref></sup> and unseen.</p>
<p>33. POURED. <italic>Nittakh</italic> (poured) is used in the same sense as <italic>ke-hittukh</italic> (as is melted) in<sup><xref rid="fn1512">117</xref></sup> <italic>As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace</italic> (Ezek. 22:22). It is a <italic>nifal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1513">118</xref></sup> like the word <italic>niggash</italic> (drew near) in <italic>but Moses drew near unto the thick darkness</italic> (Ex. 20:18).</p>
<p>34. AND WHEN PHARAOH SAW. Scripture now mentions, <italic>he sinned yet more</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1514">119</xref></sup> because Pharaoh confessed and said, <italic>I have sinned this time</italic> (v. 27).<sup><xref rid="fn1515">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND HARDENED HIS HEART, HE AND HIS SERVANTS.] From this, Moses&#x2019; words, <italic>But as for thee and thy servants</italic> (v. 30), become clear.<sup><xref rid="fn1516">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. AND THE HEART OF PHARAOH WAS HARDENED. Though he feared this plague more than the earlier ones.<sup><xref rid="fn1517">122</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1396"><sup>1</sup> The first two plagues came about through Egypt&#x2019;s waters.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1404"><sup>9</sup> The plague of hail.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1405"><sup>10</sup> A layer of wind surrounding the earth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1406"><sup>11</sup> A layer of fire surrounding the earth. Medieval man believed in four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. I.E. explains that all the earthly elements plus some heavenly elements were involved in bringing about the plagues. That is, two blows came from the water, two from the earth, two from the air, one from a combination of air and fire, two more from the air (locusts and darkness), and one from the heavens. Earth is the heaviest element. We therefore would imagine that it would be the first element involved in the plague. However, I.E. notes in Gen. 1:6 that it is the nature of water to be below the earth. Hence the first plague came from the waters, and succeeding plagues moved upward to the heavens.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1407"><sup>12</sup> This too came about from the air, in that the air was clouded (Krinsky). See I.E on Ex. 10:22.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1409"><sup>14</sup> I.E. apparently believes that an evil conjugation of the stars caused the first-born to die.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1411"><sup>16</sup> The word <italic>machazik</italic> (hold them) is a <italic>hifil</italic>, a causative. It literally means causes to hold. Hence, whenever this form is encountered, the word hand or something similar is implied although not always stated. Our phrase literally reads: and will still cause to hold them. I.E. interprets this to mean: and will still cause your hand (or something similar) to hold them (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1412"><sup>17</sup> Hebrew, <italic>machazik</italic>. J.P.S. translates as <italic>taketh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1413"><sup>18</sup> This too should be read as: one that causeth his hand to hold a dog by the ears. It literally reads: one that causeth to hold a dog by the ears.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1417"><sup>22</sup> The word <italic>kove</italic> is spelled <italic>kof, vav, yod</italic>. This comment presents a problem. <italic>Prima facie</italic>, no <italic>yod</italic> has been interchanged for a <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>kove</italic>, because this is the normal construct form of the word. Compare, <italic>love</italic> (<italic>lamed, vav, heh</italic>) and <italic>shave</italic> (<italic>shin, vav, heh</italic>). We must assume that I.E. read <italic>koye</italic> rather than <italic>kove</italic> (same vocalization but different spelling). See Rabbi David Kimchi and S.

See <italic>Eduyot</italic> 2:10, &#x201C;the judgment of the Egyptians endured twelve months.&#x201D; Similarly <italic>Seder Olam</italic>, 3. Also, according to the rabbis, since Israel was delivered in Nisan and the plagues lasted a year they had to commence in Iyar (<italic>Seder Olam</italic> 3). It is possible to further interpret the rabbinic statement that the judgment of the Egyptians lasted for one year to mean that it lasted for one year from the time that Moses first appeared before Pharaoh. If we assume the aforementioned then Moses first appeared before Israel and Pharaoh in the month of Iyar. Furthermore, if we accept the fact that the judgment of the Egyptians lasted for a year then each of the ten plagues struck a little over a month apart (Tiferet Israel on <italic>Eduyot</italic> 3:10). Cf. <italic>Shemot Rabba</italic> 9:12, &#x201C;Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Nehemiah: One says Moses warned them for 24 days before (he plague struck and the plague ravaged them for seven days.

<ftnote id="fn1474"><sup>79</sup> That is, when God told Moses, <italic>Stretch forth thy hand</italic>, he meant stretch forth thy rod with thy hand (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1475"><sup>80</sup> It is thus perfectly logically to assume that when God told him, <italic>Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven</italic>, He meant stretch forth thy rod with thy hand toward heaven.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1476"><sup>81</sup> Heaven here is short for or refers to the firmament of heaven, which refers to the air and not to heaven <italic>per se</italic> (Weiser). See I.E. on Gen. 1:6 and 1:20 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1477"><sup>82</sup> Fire rises upward.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1478"><sup>83</sup> For fire and water do not mix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1479"><sup>84</sup> The reference appears to be to Israel. God pitied Israel and their cattle and none of them died (Krinsky, Netter). Weiser suggests that the reference is to Egypt. God pitied the Egyptians and warned them to gather in their cattle and stay indoors. However, the remainder of I.E.&#x2019;s comment does not seem to bear out Weiser&#x2019;s contention.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1480"><sup>85</sup> As he did in the case of the murrain. See verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1481"><sup>86</sup> Verse 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1482"><sup>87</sup> Verse 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1483"><sup>88</sup> <italic>YHVH</italic>, for Pharaoh said, <italic>Entreat YHVH</italic> (the Lord).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1484"><sup>89</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on Ex. 6:2 and 8:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1485"><sup>90</sup> But rather used the term <italic>kolot Elohim</italic>. Since Pharaoh referred to <italic>YHVH / Adonai</italic> and to <italic>Elohim</italic>, he, being a pagan, might have referred to two deities. Hence Moses used the term <italic>YHVH / Adonai Elohim</italic> (the Lord God), which means <italic>YHVH</italic> alone is God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1486"><sup>91</sup> <italic>YHVH / Adonai Elohim</italic>. Because Moses addressed Israelites, and they knew that <italic>YHVH / Adonai</italic> alone is God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1487"><sup>92</sup> Rather than <italic>YHVH.</italic> Hence it does not mean <italic>YHVH</italic> alone is God but rather <italic>O Lord God.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1488"><sup>93</sup> See <italic>Mekhilta, Bo</italic>, chap. 1; <italic>Shemot Rabba</italic> 12:5, and Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1489"><sup>94</sup> Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1490"><sup>95</sup> According to Rashi <italic>terem</italic> means not yet. He renders <italic>terem tire&#x2019;un</italic> as: you will not yet fear. However, I.E. quoted Rashi as saying that <italic>terem</italic> means no. Most of the commentaries avoid the issue. They apparently believe that I.E. was laconic in quoting Rashi. However, in his short commentary, I.E. quotes Rabbi Judah the grammarian as saying that <italic>terem</italic> means no. Weiser suggests that I.E. confused Rashi and Rabbi Judah in his long commentary. Since, as has been shown in Vol. 1 of this work, I.E. often quoted from memory and, as Birnbaum notes, did not always have time to edit his writings, it is quite possible that Weiser is right.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1491"><sup>96</sup> Rashi on our verse interprets it as meaning: they did not as yet lie down.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1492"><sup>97</sup> Not yet or no implies the end of a subject. However, <italic>terem</italic> is almost always followed by a subject. Hence I.E. interprets <italic>terem</italic> as meaning before. The problem with I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation is that in our verse, unlike Gen. 19:4, the term seems to end the subject under conversation. It is to answer the latter that I.E. quotes Saadiah Gaon and then offers his own interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1493"><sup>98</sup> That is, of not yet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1494"><sup>99</sup> According to Saadiah Gaon the meaning of <italic>terem</italic> is before. He connects verses 29-32. If he did not connect them, verse 30 would make no sense for it would end reading: I know before you fear the Lord God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1495"><sup>100</sup> Verse 29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1496"><sup>101</sup> Verse 31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1497"><sup>102</sup> Verse 31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1498"><sup>103</sup> For they have already been destroyed, and what is destroyed is destroyed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1499"><sup>104</sup> However, I shall pray for the wheat and the spelt because they have not yet been smitten (v. 32).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1500"><sup>105</sup> The meaning of verse 30 and verse 31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1501"><sup>106</sup> Verse 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1502"><sup>107</sup> Verse 31 starts with a <italic>vav</italic>. This seems to indicate that, contra Saadiah Gaon, the verse introduces a new topic and is not dependent on verse 30. If it were, it should read, <italic>ki terem tire&#x2019;un mepene Adonai Elohim ha-pishtah ve-hase&#x2019;orah nu-katah</italic> (but before you will fear the Lord God, the flax and the barley will be smitten). The fact that it opens with <italic>ve-ha-pishtah</italic> (and the barley) shows that verse 31 is an independent verse. The same applies to the <italic>vav</italic> that opens verse 32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1503"><sup>108</sup> For the <italic>vav</italic> at the beginning of a verse does not always introduce an independent clause. See I.E. on verse 21 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1504"><sup>109</sup> I.E. agrees with Saadiah Gaon that <italic>terem</italic> means before. However, he does not see any need to connect and interpret the verses as Saadiah does.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1505"><sup>110</sup> Actually two words, <italic>efrosh</italic> (I spread) <italic>kapai</italic> (my hands).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1506"><sup>111</sup> Adding these two words eliminates the problem of no appropriate subject following <italic>terem.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1507"><sup>112</sup> That Moses politely alluded to the fact that Pharaoh would change his mind as soon as the plague disappeared (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1508"><sup>113</sup> Contra Saadiah Gaon who believed that verse 31 is dependent on verse 30. I.E. holds that verse 31 is independent. He explains that it relates what happened next, not what Moses told Pharaoh about his limited fear of God. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on verse 30 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1509"><sup>114</sup> <italic>Nukkkatah</italic> and <italic>nukku</italic> are third person <italic>pu&#x2019;als</italic>. Their root is <italic>nun, kaf, heh</italic>. In the verb <italic>makkeh</italic>, which is a <italic>hifil</italic>, the <italic>nun</italic> is missing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1510"><sup>115</sup> Both are in the <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic>, as are <italic>nukku</italic> and <italic>nukkatah.</italic> Hence their <italic>nuns</italic> are not <italic>nifal</italic> form <italic>nuns</italic> but root letters (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1511"><sup>116</sup> Being beneath the earth is like being in a dark place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1512"><sup>117</sup> Or turns liquid. Similarly, <italic>nittakh</italic> in our verse refers to liquid.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1513"><sup>118</sup> Hence it means was poured.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1514"><sup>119</sup> Which it never did before.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1515"><sup>120</sup> Scripture notes that he continued to sin even after he had confessed his transgression.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1516"><sup>121</sup> That Moses was justified in saying what he did (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1517"><sup>122</sup> Even though the plague of hail scared him more than any of the previous plagues, as soon as it passed Pharaoh hardened his heart.</ftnote>

<p align="blockquote">God saved the seed of the whole-hearted man;<sup><xref rid="fn1518">1</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">He taught them a law by the hand of His servant.<sup><xref rid="fn1519">2</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">Behold the secret of the Torah portion</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>Go In Unto Pharaoh</italic> is the Commandment regarding, <italic>this month.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1520">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>1. GO IN UNTO PHARAOH. Go in unto him this time<sup><xref rid="fn1521">4</xref></sup> and do not be astonished that he has hardened his heart until now,<sup><xref rid="fn1522">5</xref></sup> <italic>For I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants.</italic> God mentioned <italic>the heart of his servants</italic> because their hearts<sup><xref rid="fn1523">6</xref></sup> would mellow with the coming of the plague of the locusts.<sup><xref rid="fn1524">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FOR I HAVE HARDENED HIS HEART.] Its meaning is: I have hardened his heart that <italic>I might show these My signs in the midst of them.</italic></p>
<p>The Spanish scholars differ with regard to the word <italic>shiti</italic> (I might show).<sup><xref rid="fn1525">8</xref></sup> Some say that <italic>shiti</italic> is similar to <italic>binu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1526">9</xref></sup> (consider) (Deut. 32:7), <italic>simu</italic> (set)<sup><xref rid="fn1527">10</xref></sup> (Gen. 43:21), and other such words.<sup><xref rid="fn1528">11</xref></sup> The same is the case<sup><xref rid="fn1529">12</xref></sup> with <italic>yashit</italic> (he will put), <italic>yasim</italic> (he will place), <italic>yavin</italic> (he will understand), and comparable words<sup><xref rid="fn1530">13</xref></sup> in all of their<sup><xref rid="fn1531">14</xref></sup> forms. Others hold that <italic>shiti</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic> minus the sign of the form,<sup><xref rid="fn1532">15</xref></sup> because they found the words <italic>yasum</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1533">16</xref></sup> (maketh) and <italic>la-sus</italic> (rejoice)<sup><xref rid="fn1534">17</xref></sup> in <italic>who maketh a man dumb</italic> (Ex. 4:11) and <italic>for the Lord will again rejoice over thee for good, as He rejoiced over thy fathers</italic> (Deut. 30:9), all of which are <italic>kals</italic>. Others say that <italic>yasis</italic> is similar to <italic>yasus</italic> (he will rejoice)<sup><xref rid="fn1535">18</xref></sup> and <italic>shiti</italic> to <italic>sumi</italic> (set).<sup><xref rid="fn1536">19</xref></sup> They are all <italic>kals</italic>.</p>
<p>2. AND THAT THOU MAYEST TELL. God spoke to Moses, who is equivalent to all of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1537">20</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>that ye may know that I am the Lord</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1538">21</xref></sup> means that all Israel shall know the aforementioned. The Torah speaks in human terms when it says, <italic>I have wrought</italic>, for it pictures God as acting as a human being who arranges events in order to avenge himself upon another.</p>
<p>3. AND MOSES AND AARON WENT IN. We know that Moses would not come in unto Pharaoh unless Aaron was with him,<sup><xref rid="fn1539">22</xref></sup> as Aaron was his spokesman.<sup><xref rid="fn1540">23</xref></sup> Scripture here mentions Moses and Aaron because now, unlike any of the other instances of the plagues, they were both returned to and finally expelled from the presence of Pharaoh.</p>
<p>TO HUMBLE. <italic>Le&#x2019;anot</italic> (to humble) is a <italic>nifal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1541">24</xref></sup> It comes from the same root as <italic>ani</italic> (humble).<sup><xref rid="fn1542">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. LOCUSTS. <italic>Arbeh</italic> (locusts) is the name of a type of locust.<sup><xref rid="fn1543">26</xref></sup> Perhaps it is so called because it is more numerous than other kinds of locusts.<sup><xref rid="fn1544">27</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>That which the palmer-worm</italic> (gazam)<sup><xref rid="fn1545">28</xref></sup> <italic>hath left hath the locust</italic> (arbeh) <italic>eaten</italic> (Joel 1:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1546">29</xref></sup> Concerning it, Scripture states, <italic>My great army which I sent among you</italic> (Joel 2:25). If this be the case then the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>arbeh</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn1547">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THEY SHALL COVER. Metaphorically speaking.</p>
<p>THAT ONE SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE.<sup><xref rid="fn1548">31</xref></sup> The word <italic>ish</italic> (a man) has been omitted.<sup><xref rid="fn1549">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yefet says that many days passed between the plague of hail and the plague of locusts, for Scripture states: <italic>which groweth for you out of the field</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1550">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. SHALL BE FILLED. This word<sup><xref rid="fn1551">34</xref></sup> is irregularly used in the Hebrew language.<sup><xref rid="fn1552">35</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>u-male&#x2019;u</italic> (shall be filled) is that the houses were full of locusts.<sup><xref rid="fn1553">36</xref></sup> However, we also find <italic>mile&#x2019;u</italic> (fill) in <italic>Fill four jars with water</italic> (I Kings 18:34) wherein <italic>mile&#x2019;u</italic> is a transitive verb. It is as if it were vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>mem</italic> and a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>lamed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1554">37</xref></sup> and belonged to the conjugational form that receives a <italic>dagesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1555">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND HE TURNED.] Rabbi Joshua says that <italic>va-yifen</italic> (and he turned) refers to Moses, who paid his respects to the throne by facing the king<sup><xref rid="fn1556">39</xref></sup> and walking out backwards.<sup><xref rid="fn1557">40</xref></sup> However, Yefet says that Moses finished his duties.<sup><xref rid="fn1558">41</xref></sup> So too <italic>u-fanita</italic> (and thou shalt turn)<sup><xref rid="fn1559">42</xref></sup> in <italic>and thou shalt turn in the morning</italic> (Deut. 16:7). However, what shall Yefet do with the word <italic>va-yifen</italic> (and he looked) in <italic>And he looked this way and that way</italic> (Ex. 2:12)?<sup><xref rid="fn1560">43</xref></sup> <italic>Va-yifen</italic> is to be explained as coming from the same root as <italic>panim</italic> (face).<sup><xref rid="fn1561">44</xref></sup> It has the same meaning as <italic>va-yar</italic> (and he saw). Now Moses left the presence of Pharaoh without his permission. Scripture notes this because Pharaoh asked that Moses and Aaron be brought back. After they were returned Pharaoh, in anger, commanded that they be driven out.<sup><xref rid="fn1562">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND PHARAOH&#x2019;S SERVANTS SAID. The meaning of <italic>ha-terem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1563">46</xref></sup> <italic>teda</italic> (knowest thou not yet) is: do you first want it to become clear to you that Egypt is destroyed.</p>
<p>8. WERE BROUGHT AGAIN. The word <italic>et</italic> indicates the thing itself.<sup><xref rid="fn1564">47</xref></sup> Now whether one says <italic>ha-adam ohavi</italic> (the man loves me), in which the <italic>yod</italic> is a first person pronominal suffix, or he says <italic>ha-adam ohev oti</italic> (the man loves me),<sup><xref rid="fn1565">48</xref></sup> the reference being to my very self,<sup><xref rid="fn1566">49</xref></sup> the meaning is one and the same. Therefore, if someone says <italic>re&#x2019;uven harag <span class="underline">et</span> shimon</italic> (Reuben killed Simeon) he is telling us that Simeon has been slain. However, the same is the case if he says, <italic>re&#x2019;uven harag shimon</italic> (Reuben killed Simeon).<sup><xref rid="fn1567">50</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-rav ya&#x2019;avod tza&#x2019;ir</italic> (and the elder shall serve the younger) (Gen. 25:23)<sup><xref rid="fn1568">51</xref></sup> and <italic>asher bara Elohim adam</italic> (that God created man) (Deut. 4:32)<sup><xref rid="fn1569">52</xref></sup> are similar. Do not think that <italic>et</italic> indicates the direct object because it is often found to be so used.<sup><xref rid="fn1570">53</xref></sup> It is also found before the subject, as in <italic>u-va ha-ari ve-et ha-dov</italic> (and when there came a lion, or a bear) (I Sam. 17:34)<sup><xref rid="fn1571">54</xref></sup> and many other similar cases.</p>
<p>Rabbi Judah the grammarian says that Scripture reads, <italic>va-yushav</italic> (were brought again) rather than <italic>va-yushevu</italic> (were brought again)<sup><xref rid="fn1572">55</xref></sup> because of the word <italic>et</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1573">56</xref></sup> However, I believe that Scripture reads, <italic>va-yushav</italic> because Moses was the most important one. Scripture similarly reads, <italic>va-tedabber miriam ve-aharon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1574">57</xref></sup> (And Miriam and Aaron spoke) (Num. 12:1) because Miriam was the main speaker.</p>
<p>9. FOR WE MUST HOLD A FEAST UNTO THE LORD. All of us are obligated to sacrifice unto the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn1575">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. SO BE THE LORD WITH YOU. Whom you say is with you.<sup><xref rid="fn1576">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>[SEE YE THAT EVIL IS BEFORE YOUR FACE.] The evil is close to you and is before your face. This meaning is also to be connected to <italic>for that is what ye desire</italic> (v. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn1577">60</xref></sup> Hence it is only right that I so act. At this point Pharaoh surmised that they wanted to flee.<sup><xref rid="fn1578">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that our Master Moses did not go so far as to lie and say that Israel would return. He merely said that they would travel a three days&#x2019; journey (Ex. 9:23). However, the Egyptians thought that they would return. Hence they let them have what they asked.<sup><xref rid="fn1579">62</xref></sup> Moses had another reason for acting in this manner.<sup><xref rid="fn1580">63</xref></sup> Had Pharaoh given Israel permission to go<sup><xref rid="fn1581">64</xref></sup> and Israel did not return, Pharaoh would not have pursued them. However, God commanded Moses to act in this manner so that Pharaoh would chase after them and drown. Behold, this is clearly stated, <italic>that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth</italic> (Ex. 14:2).<sup><xref rid="fn1582">65</xref></sup> One should not question the acts of God,<sup><xref rid="fn1583">66</xref></sup> as He does everything with wisdom, though it be hidden from the eyes even of wise men. We find a similarity in the account of David, viz., <italic>And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is the Lord gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines</italic> (II Sam. 5:24).<sup><xref rid="fn1584">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. NOT SO; GO NOW YE THAT ARE MEN. The word <italic>gever</italic> (man), unlike the word <italic>adam</italic> (man),<sup><xref rid="fn1585">68</xref></sup> always refers to a man in Scripture.</p>
<p>FOR THAT IS WHAT YE DESIRE. The above-noted evil.<sup><xref rid="fn1586">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. FOR THE LOCUSTS. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that <italic>ba-arbeh</italic> (for the locusts) indicates that Moses placed a locust on the rod.<sup><xref rid="fn1587">70</xref></sup> However, this is incorrect. The correct interpretation of <italic>ba-arbeh</italic> is: so that the locusts would come.<sup><xref rid="fn1588">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AN EAST WIND. <italic>Kadim</italic> (east) is an adjective, since <italic>kedemah mizrachah</italic> (the east side) is a noun.<sup><xref rid="fn1589">72</xref></sup> <italic>Kadim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1590">73</xref></sup> is so called because it is the first of the sides<sup><xref rid="fn1591">74</xref></sup> because the sun begins to shine there. Hence the west is termed <italic>achor</italic> (hinder side).<sup><xref rid="fn1592">75</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Behold, I go forward</italic> (kedem), <italic>but He is not there, And backward</italic> (achor), <italic>but I cannot perceive Him</italic> (Job 23:8).</p>
<p>BROUGHT THE LOCUSTS. From its place and deposited them in all the kingdom of Egypt.</p>
<p>14. WENT UP. <italic>Neither after them shall be such</italic> was prophetically written.<sup><xref rid="fn1593">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. FOR THEY COVERED THE FACE OF THE WHOLE EARTH. The meaning of <italic>so the land was darkened</italic> is that the locusts intervened between the sun and the land. The land is always dark.<sup><xref rid="fn1594">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THEN PHARAOH CALLED FOR MOSES AND AARON IN HASTE. Via his messengers.<sup><xref rid="fn1595">78</xref></sup> Pharaoh added, I have sinned, because he drove them away from his presence in disgrace.</p>
<p>17. NOW THEREFORE FORGIVE, I PRAY THEE. I will explain the term <italic>sa na</italic> (forgive, I pray thee) in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1596">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>[ONLY THIS ONCE.] Because I will not sin again by rebelling against the Lord. Pharaoh did not promise to free the people because Moses was angry.<sup><xref rid="fn1597">80</xref></sup> Moses went out of the city as was his wont<sup><xref rid="fn1598">81</xref></sup> and prayed.<sup><xref rid="fn1599">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND THE LORD TURNED AN EXCEEDING STRONG WEST WIND. West is termed <italic>yam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1600">83</xref></sup> in the holy tongue because the great sea<sup><xref rid="fn1601">84</xref></sup> which goes out from Spain and passes by the land of Egypt and goes on to the Land of Israel lies in the west. This sea is not to be identified with the Atlantic Ocean because Israel did not inherit that much territory.<sup><xref rid="fn1602">85</xref></sup> The Spanish Sea is called the great sea because it is three hundred Persian miles wide, whereas none of the seas in the Land of Israel such as the Sea of Reeds, the Kineret, and the Salt Sea is even thirty Persian miles wide.</p>
<p>20. BUT THE LORD HARDENED. This is to be understood &#x00E0; la the words of our sages of blessed memory who said, &#x201C;The door is opened for one who comes to defile himself.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1603">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THE LORD SAID. We may logically assume although it is not so stated that Moses&#x2019; staff was in his hand.<sup><xref rid="fn1604">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVEN DARKNESS WHICH MAY BE FELT. Yefet says that <italic>ve-yamesh</italic> (which may be felt) is like <italic>ve-yamish</italic> (and it shall depart);<sup><xref rid="fn1605">88</xref></sup> its meaning is: that the darkness to which they have become accustomed shall depart and another type of darkness, thicker than it, shall come.

Now the meaning of <italic>ve-yamesh choshekh</italic> (even darkness which may be felt) is that the Egyptians will feel the darkness with their hands,<sup><xref rid="fn1615">98</xref></sup> for the darkness shall be so thick that neither a candle nor a fire shall give off light. <italic>They saw not one another</italic> (v. 23) neither by the light of day nor by candlelight is proof of the aforementioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1616">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND MOSES STRETCHED FORTH. The Egyptians had no way of knowing that three days passed except through the Israelites, who had light.

Now if <italic>shiti</italic> was a <italic>kal</italic> it should read <italic>yashut</italic> (like <italic>yasum</italic>), rather than <italic>yashit</italic>, in the third person imperfect form. Hence the form <italic>yashit</italic> must be a <italic>hifil</italic>. Similarly, if <italic>shiti</italic> were a <italic>kal</italic> it would read <italic>shuti</italic>. It should be noted that these grammarians assume that the root of <italic>shiti</italic> is <italic>shin, vav, tav</italic> (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1534"><sup>17</sup> <italic>La-sus</italic> is a <italic>kal</italic> infinitive from the root <italic>sin, vav, sin</italic>.

Hence <italic>shiti</italic> cannot be a <italic>kal</italic>. The point of these grammarians is that when we come across forms such as <italic>yasis, yashit</italic> and the like, we are dealing with <italic>hifils</italic> having a <italic>vav</italic> as a middle root letter. When we come across forms such as <italic>yasus, yashut</italic>, we are dealing with <italic>kals</italic> having a <italic>vav</italic> as a middle root letter.

<ftnote id="fn1535"><sup>18</sup> In other words, <italic>yasis</italic> is not a <italic>hifil</italic>; it is a <italic>kal</italic>. The reason it is pronounced <italic>yasis</italic> and not <italic>yasus</italic> is that <italic>yasis</italic> comes from the root <italic>sin, yod, sin</italic>, and <italic>yasus</italic> comes from the root <italic>yod, vav, sin</italic> (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1536"><sup>19</sup> There are two roots for the word set. One comes from the root <italic>sin, yod, mem</italic>, and one from the root <italic>sin, vav, mem</italic>.

Both <italic>som</italic> and <italic>tasim</italic> are <italic>kals</italic>. It is the same with the words for put/set.

Now it is common knowledge that it is beyond the ken of a wise man to ascertain the exact moment of noon without great effort and the use of large copper instruments.<sup><xref rid="fn1636">16</xref></sup> It goes without saying that it is much harder to ascertain the more difficult time of midnight.<sup><xref rid="fn1637">17</xref></sup> I believe that there is no need for all of this since the meaning of <italic>ka-chatzot ha-laylah</italic> (about midnight) is, when the first half of the night has passed. The same is the case with <italic>ba-chatzi ha-laylah</italic> in <italic>And it came to pass at midnight</italic> (Ex. 12:29). It refers to the remaining half of the night.<sup><xref rid="fn1638">18</xref></sup> <italic>And it came to pass at midnight</italic> (ba-chatzi ha-laylah) (Ruth 3:8)<sup><xref rid="fn1639">19</xref></sup> and <italic>At midnight</italic> (chatzot laylah) <italic>I will rise to give thanks to thee</italic> (Ps. 119:62) are convincing proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1640">20</xref></sup></p>

<p>5. THE FIRST-BORN OF PHARAOH THAT SITTETH UPON HIS THRONE. Who is fit to sit upon Pharaoh&#x2019;s throne after him.<sup><xref rid="fn1642">22</xref></sup> Moses mentioned the most honored of all the Egyptians, namely, the son of their lord whom all of them serve and also the meanest of them all, namely, the first-born of the maid-servant, who is himself a slave.<sup><xref rid="fn1643">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT IS BEHIND THE MILL.] Who grinds.<sup><xref rid="fn1644">24</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And he did grind in the prison house</italic> (Jud. 16:21).</p>
<p>I have already explained that the prophets are not careful in preserving the exact wording but are rather concerned with reproducing meanings.<sup><xref rid="fn1645">25</xref></sup> The words <italic>hagmi&#x2019;ini</italic> (give me to drink) (Gen. 24:17)<sup><xref rid="fn1646">26</xref></sup> and <italic>hashkini</italic> (give me to drink) (Gen. 29:45);<sup><xref rid="fn1647">27</xref></sup> <italic>zakhor</italic> (remember) (Ex. 20:8)<sup><xref rid="fn1648">28</xref></sup> and <italic>shamor</italic> (observe)<sup><xref rid="fn1649">29</xref></sup> (Deut. 5:12); <italic>sheker</italic> (false) (Ex. 20:13)<sup><xref rid="fn1650">30</xref></sup> and <italic>shav</italic> (false) (Deut. 5:17);<sup><xref rid="fn1651">31</xref></sup> <italic>lo tachmod</italic> (thou shalt not covet) (Ex. 20:14)<sup><xref rid="fn1652">32</xref></sup> and <italic>ve-lo titavveh</italic> (neither shalt thou covet) (Deut. 5:18)<sup><xref rid="fn1653">33</xref></sup> have one meaning. I will yet discuss this when I comment on the prayer of Moses (Ex. 32:9). Now, <italic>the first-born of the maid-servant</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1654">34</xref></sup> means the same as <italic>the first-born of the captive</italic> (Ex. 12:29).<sup><xref rid="fn1655">35</xref></sup> The captive woman is a maid-servant who sleeps in the dungeon at night as prisoners do, as was noted by Joseph when he said, <italic>that they should put me into the dungeon</italic> (Gen. 40:15).</p>
<p>6. AND THERE SHALL BE A GREAT CRY. We do not find Scripture elsewhere stating anything like <italic>kamohu lo nihyatah ve-khamohu lo tosif</italic> (such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore).<sup><xref rid="fn1656">36</xref></sup> The word <italic>al</italic> (over) has been omitted from our verse and the clause should be understood literally as follows: such as over it there hath been none like it, nor such over it shall be like it a cry anymore.<sup><xref rid="fn1657">37</xref></sup> Such as like it (<italic>kamohu</italic>) refers to havoc, calamity, death, and the like.<sup><xref rid="fn1658">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. SHALL NOT A DOG WHET HIS TONGUE. To frighten them. <italic>None whetted his tongue against any of the children of Israel</italic> (Josh. 10:21) is similar. Its meaning is that no dog shall bark at them or bite them. Now no dog shall whet his tongue at them or their cattle here on earth. How much more so when He sends a destroyer from heaven to smite their first-born?<sup><xref rid="fn1659">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND ALL THESE THY SERVANTS SHALL COME DOWN UNTO ME&#x2026;SAYING. On your behalf.<sup><xref rid="fn1660">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT FOLLOW THEE. <italic>Be-raglekha</italic> (follow thee) means: who are under your dominion.<sup><xref rid="fn1661">41</xref></sup> For I will lead them to the place which I desire. <italic>And there went up ten thousand at his feet</italic> (be-raglav) (Jud. 4:10) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1662">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses went out in hot anger because Pharaoh had told him, <italic>see my face no more</italic> (Ex. 10:28).</p>
<p>9. AND THE LORD SAID. According to the manner of the Hebrews and the rules of language this is to be rendered: and the Lord had already said.<sup><xref rid="fn1663">43</xref></sup> There are many other such instances.</p>
<p>10. AND MOSES. Even though Moses and Aaron did all these wonders which are mentioned in Scripture, Pharaoh&#x2019;s heart did not soften and he did not let them go, because God hardened his heart. The chapter opening with the words, <italic>And it came to pass at midnight</italic> (Ex. 12:29)<sup><xref rid="fn1664">44</xref></sup> should by right have followed next so that the plagues would be described in order. However, the chapter dealing with, <italic>This is the ordinance of the Passover</italic> (chap. 12) was inserted in the middle to inform us how the first-born of Israel were saved when the destroyer came upon Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn1665">45</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 12</title>
<p>1. AND THE LORD SPOKE. Scripture now mentions the first of the commandments given via Moses and Aaron, as they alone were prophets of the law.<sup><xref rid="fn1666">1</xref></sup> After them, except for extenuating circumstances as in the case of Gideon<sup><xref rid="fn1667">2</xref></sup> and Elijah,<sup><xref rid="fn1668">3</xref></sup> no new precepts were revealed. Do not take the chanting of psalms in the house of God instituted by David<sup><xref rid="fn1669">4</xref></sup> to heart,<sup><xref rid="fn1670">5</xref></sup> as the latter was an enactment and an institution established by David and Solomon.<sup><xref rid="fn1671">6</xref></sup> Thus Scripture states, <italic>by their beliefs</italic> (II Chron. 9:22), and not by their prophecies. However, Saadiah Gaon says that they had a tradition going back to Moses that a king would arise and innovate musical compositions.<sup><xref rid="fn1672">7</xref></sup> <italic>Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day</italic> (Jer. 17:22) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn1673">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. THIS MONTH. Rabbi Judah Ha-Parsi<sup><xref rid="fn1674">9</xref></sup> says that the Israelites, like the uncircumcised,<sup><xref rid="fn1675">10</xref></sup> employed a solar calendar. He offers as proof, <italic>Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season</italic> (Ex. 13:10). But lunar years are not all equal, as the seasons of plowing and harvest are dependent solely on the movement of the sun as it travels to the north or the south.<sup><xref rid="fn1676">11</xref></sup> However, he did not speak correctly.</p>
<p>I will now explain.<sup><xref rid="fn1677">12</xref></sup> We know that it takes the moon, moving in its sphere<sup><xref rid="fn1678">13</xref></sup> in a given point facing the sphere of the zodiac, close to twenty-seven and a third days to return to this very point. Now let us assume a starting point wherein the moon is in conjunction with the sun at the beginning of Aries. In such a case the moon would not find the sun at the head of Aries when it returned there<sup><xref rid="fn1679">14</xref></sup> because the sun, traveling in its mean motion,<sup><xref rid="fn1680">15</xref></sup> would by then have journeyed twenty-seven degrees.<sup><xref rid="fn1681">16</xref></sup> This is because, contrary to the movement above,<sup><xref rid="fn1682">17</xref></sup> the sun and the moon move from west to east. The sun and the moon would next be in conjunction at the end of twenty-nine and a half days, two-thirds and seventy-three parts of an hour, according to the way Israelites divide the hour.<sup><xref rid="fn1683">18</xref></sup> Thus<sup><xref rid="fn1684">19</xref></sup> the moon would have traveled the very degrees that the sun journeyed,<sup><xref rid="fn1685">20</xref></sup> and the moon also would have had to travel two days and close to five hours in the parts in which the sun had moved.<sup><xref rid="fn1686">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Actually, the year belongs only to the sun,<sup><xref rid="fn1687">22</xref></sup> as the sun gives birth to the four seasons of the year, cold, heat, summer, and winter. Now let us assume the sun to be at the beginning of Aries. It will then travel three hundred and sixty-five days plus close to a quarter of a day in its sphere until it returns a second time to where it started out. It is for this reason that a year is called a <italic>shanah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1688">23</xref></sup> Now the moon has no year, as the sun has no month. Nothing new happens to the sun; only to the light of the moon does something new occur.<sup><xref rid="fn1689">24</xref></sup> It is because of this that a month is called a <italic>chodesh</italic> and also a <italic>yerach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1690">25</xref></sup> It is so called<sup><xref rid="fn1691">26</xref></sup> because the light of the moon is renewed. We have conclusive proof that the moon has no light of its own, and that its light comes from the sun. The sun<sup><xref rid="fn1692">27</xref></sup> therefore does not darken except in the moment when it is in conjunction with the moon at the head or the tail of Aries.<sup><xref rid="fn1693">28</xref></sup> Similarly, the moon does not darken except when it is opposite the sun in the aforementioned places<sup><xref rid="fn1694">29</xref></sup> at night.<sup><xref rid="fn1695">30</xref></sup> Due to the fact that the year of the uncircumcised is close to a solar year<sup><xref rid="fn1696">31</xref></sup> and because they saw that the moon is renewed twelve times during a solar year, they divided the days of the year into twelve parts and called each part a month because it is close to the days of a lunar month. This arrangement of theirs is not in keeping with the laws of nature.<sup><xref rid="fn1697">32</xref></sup> Similarly the Moslems,<sup><xref rid="fn1698">33</xref></sup> because their festivals are contingent upon lunar months<sup><xref rid="fn1699">34</xref></sup> and a month starts from the night that the moon is first seen. They saw that there are twelve months in a solar year and they did not find a closer way of reckoning than this,<sup><xref rid="fn1700">35</xref></sup> as there is only a difference of eleven days between the two ways of numbering the year.<sup><xref rid="fn1701">36</xref></sup> They therefore made all of their years lunar. The time of their Passover<sup><xref rid="fn1702">37</xref></sup> recedes each year by eleven days until thirty-three solar years equal thirty-four lunar years.<sup><xref rid="fn1703">38</xref></sup> These things<sup><xref rid="fn1704">39</xref></sup> are not based on the laws of nature.</p>
<p>Now God commanded in His Torah that the festivals be kept in their seasons, for He said, <italic>Observe the month of spring and keep the passover unto the Lord thy God</italic> (Deut. 16:1). Now if spring is not found<sup><xref rid="fn1705">40</xref></sup> by half of the month<sup><xref rid="fn1706">41</xref></sup> then we make Passover in the month close to it.<sup><xref rid="fn1707">42</xref></sup> God similarly called the festival of Sha&#x2019;vu&#x2019;ot, <italic>the feast of harvest</italic> (Ex. 23:16)<sup><xref rid="fn1708">43</xref></sup> and the festival of Sukkot, <italic>the feast of ingathering</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).<sup><xref rid="fn1709">44</xref></sup> The harvest and the ingathering are dependent on spring.<sup><xref rid="fn1710">45</xref></sup> Furthermore, we see that God said that we should not observe the Passover on any day but the midpoint of a lunar month.<sup><xref rid="fn1711">46</xref></sup> The same applies to the festival of Sukkot.<sup><xref rid="fn1712">47</xref></sup> God thus commanded that we observe lunar months<sup><xref rid="fn1713">48</xref></sup> and that the seasons of the festivals be preserved.<sup><xref rid="fn1714">49</xref></sup> Moses did not mention in the Torah that we should count twelve or thirteen months.<sup><xref rid="fn1715">50</xref></sup> He said only<sup><xref rid="fn1716">51</xref></sup> that we should begin the count<sup><xref rid="fn1717">52</xref></sup> in the month that we find spring. That month is to be called the first month whether the year has twelve or thirteen months. It is thus written, <italic>in the second month</italic> (Num. 10:11) and <italic>In the third month</italic> (Ex. 19:1). All the other months are similarly written.<sup><xref rid="fn1718">53</xref></sup> Nisan, Iyyar, Sivan, and all the other names of the months are not Hebrew. They are Chaldean terms. We therefore do not encounter these terms in any book of Scripture except in the Scroll of Esther and in the prophecies of Zechariah, Daniel,<sup><xref rid="fn1719">54</xref></sup> and Ezra, who were in the Diaspora. This then is its<sup><xref rid="fn1720">55</xref></sup> meaning: in the first month, which is called Nisan in the Chaldean tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn1721">56</xref></sup> However, we find three months called by other names in Hebrew, viz., <italic>in the month Ziv</italic> (I Kings 6:1); <italic>in the month Ethanim</italic> (I Kings 8:2); <italic>in the month Bul</italic> (I Kings 6:7). If we pursue the literal meaning of the text the month of Ziv is not Nisan but Iyyar, for it is written, <italic>in the month Ziv, which is the second month</italic> (I Kings 6:1), that is, which is known as the second to the first of the months of Israel. The words <italic>of Solomon&#x2019;s reign</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.) are not connected to the word <italic>month</italic> but rather to <italic>the fourth year of Solomon&#x2019;s reign</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1722">57</xref></sup> as we do not find the months related in the account of any king.<sup><xref rid="fn1723">58</xref></sup> Scripture only reports the year that the king started his reign. <italic>In the second day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1724">59</xref></sup> <italic>of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1725">60</xref></sup> recorded in Chronicles (II Chron. 3:2) is proof of this.</p>
<p>We can refute Judah Ha-Parsi<sup><xref rid="fn1726">61</xref></sup> with the argument that not all years are equal.<sup><xref rid="fn1727">62</xref></sup> The years differ,<sup><xref rid="fn1728">63</xref></sup> due to the effect of the planets, in that the rain increases or diminishes and the heat or cold increases or diminishes each month,<sup><xref rid="fn1729">64</xref></sup> making it different from the known norm. Spring is therefore not be found to have arrived when the sun returns to the spot that it was in at the beginning of the previous year although it was then spring. There is<sup><xref rid="fn1730">65</xref></sup> more than a year and two weeks<sup><xref rid="fn1731">66</xref></sup> between one spring<sup><xref rid="fn1732">67</xref></sup> and the next.<sup><xref rid="fn1733">68</xref></sup> The Israelites therefore relied on the spring found in their country in whatever month it occurred, as the time of the appearance of spring<sup><xref rid="fn1734">69</xref></sup> varies in all countries according to the distance of that land from the equator.</p>
<p>I will now give you a general rule. Although the Israelites in the time of the Holy Temple watched for the arrival of spring,<sup><xref rid="fn1735">70</xref></sup> the establishment of a leap year was not in their hands. It rather depended on the Bet Din which, as is related in the Mishnah,<sup><xref rid="fn1736">71</xref></sup> looked for other things besides spring.<sup><xref rid="fn1737">72</xref></sup> Now Moses did not explain to us in the Torah how we should establish years or months. Neither did he tell us what we should do if we do not find it to be spring. One can pose a difficult question from all this, namely, why did Moses explain the laws of the plagues of the leper, which fall upon one person and do not last forever,<sup><xref rid="fn1738">73</xref></sup> and leave out of the Torah the laws of the festivals<sup><xref rid="fn1739">74</xref></sup> that all of Israel is obligated to keep at all times? Furthermore, eating leaven on Passover and eating on the Day of Atonement are punished with excision. If Moses relied on the conjunction of the moon and sun he should have explained whether he meant according to the moon&#x2019;s mean motion<sup><xref rid="fn1740">75</xref></sup> or its true conjunction,<sup><xref rid="fn1741">76</xref></sup> which takes place opposite the sphere of the constellations, because at times there are approximately fourteen hours between the calculated conjunction<sup><xref rid="fn1742">77</xref></sup> and the true conjunction. It is because of this that our holy fathers said, &#x201C;At times it<sup><xref rid="fn1743">78</xref></sup> comes at longer intervals; at times it<sup><xref rid="fn1744">79</xref></sup> comes at shorter intervals.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1745">80</xref></sup> Only one who knows his way in the science of astronomy can know this. Additionally, Moses should have explained from which part of the earth we reckon the conjunction. For behold, between Jerusalem and this city, whose name is Lucca, there is more than three hours.<sup><xref rid="fn1746">81</xref></sup> If Moses relied on the time the moon is first seen<sup><xref rid="fn1747">82</xref></sup> he should have explained the place of its sighting,<sup><xref rid="fn1748">83</xref></sup> as the Arc of Vision<sup><xref rid="fn1749">84</xref></sup> changes in each place according to the earth&#x2019;s latitude and according to the latitude of the moon from the line of the constellations, in addition to changes in visibility due to longitude, latitude, atmospheric conditions, and the height of elevation or lack thereof. All of these things require lengthy exposition. Now if it is cloudy, shall we out of doubt observe the new moon for two days?<sup><xref rid="fn1750">85</xref></sup> This proves that the establishment of the new moon is contingent on the declaration of the Bet Din in each generation.<sup><xref rid="fn1751">86</xref></sup> They had a tradition that the Bet Din establish seven leap years every nineteen years, totaling two hundred and thirty-five months or six thousand, nine hundred and thirty-nine and two-thirds days, plus five hundred and ninety-five parts of an hour. The aforementioned are nineteen solar years without addition or subtraction. Do not concern yourself with the hour and four hundred and eighty-five parts of an hour<sup><xref rid="fn1752">87</xref></sup> according to &#x201C;Samuel&#x2019;s calendar.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1753">88</xref></sup> We know that this was not hidden from him.<sup><xref rid="fn1754">89</xref></sup> Samuel only used a number which was close in his time to the men of his generation.<sup><xref rid="fn1755">90</xref></sup> Today there is a difference of close to nine days<sup><xref rid="fn1756">91</xref></sup> between the true circuit<sup><xref rid="fn1757">92</xref></sup> and Samuel&#x2019;s circuit. Do not be amazed at this. For behold the <italic>Braita</italic> states<sup><xref rid="fn1758">93</xref></sup> that one who wants to know the place of the moon should calculate the year of the world and divide it into months and divide the months into twenty-nine and a half days and two-thirds of an hour, i.e., seven hundred and twenty parts of an hour.<sup><xref rid="fn1759">94</xref></sup> Now seventy-three parts are missing.<sup><xref rid="fn1760">95</xref></sup> They will add up to more than two-thirds of a day each cycle.<sup><xref rid="fn1761">96</xref></sup> There will thus be<sup><xref rid="fn1762">97</xref></sup> a difference of close to half a year between the calculation of the conjunctions from creation and our own calculation of the conjunction.<sup><xref rid="fn1763">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has thus been made clear to you that the sum of our years equals out every cycle of solar years, and our months are always lunar months.<sup><xref rid="fn1764">99</xref></sup> Blessed be the Lord who has guided me in the straight path.</p>
<p>I will now offer you proof from Scripture that the festivals are dependent upon the Bet Din. Scripture states, <italic>For the king</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1765">100</xref></sup><italic>had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month</italic> (II Chron. 30:2). Now if they had a tradition to look for spring,<sup><xref rid="fn1766">101</xref></sup> as those who argue with our rabbis of blessed memory claim, why did the king take counsel to establish the Passover in the second month?<sup><xref rid="fn1767">102</xref></sup> It will now be shown if their<sup><xref rid="fn1768">103</xref></sup> words are true. Hezekiah did three evils.<sup><xref rid="fn1769">104</xref></sup> First of all, he did not offer the Passover sacrifice in its time<sup><xref rid="fn1770">105</xref></sup> although he was ritually clean.<sup><xref rid="fn1771">106</xref></sup> Why did Hezekiah delay the observance of Passover because most of the congregation had not arrived?<sup><xref rid="fn1772">107</xref></sup> Such a thing is only found in the words of tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn1773">108</xref></sup> not in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1774">109</xref></sup> Second, he ate and caused Israel to eat leaven in the first month.<sup><xref rid="fn1775">110</xref></sup> Third, on his own<sup><xref rid="fn1776">111</xref></sup> he decided to observe the festival of unleavened bread in the second month. Such a thing is not to be done. With the exception of eating the paschal lamb<sup><xref rid="fn1777">112</xref></sup> on one night,<sup><xref rid="fn1778">113</xref></sup> the Lord did not command the observance of the Passover in the second month, for all those who are unclean eat unleavened bread along with all of Israel in the first month. Far be it for Hezekiah to do such evil. Moreover, Scripture says of him that he did not turn aside to the right or left from the commandments of the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn1779">114</xref></sup> Furthermore, Hezekiah himself said in his prayer, <italic>Remember now, O Lord, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee&#x2026;and have done that which is good in Thy sight</italic> (II Kings 20:3).</p>
<p>I will now explain.<sup><xref rid="fn1780">115</xref></sup> Know that Hezekiah took counsel with the entire congregation<sup><xref rid="fn1781">116</xref></sup> at the start of the first month that they should observe the Passover in the following month because most of the people had not arrived and the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn1782">117</xref></sup> He thus added a month to the year, and the Passover that he observed was the actual Passover<sup><xref rid="fn1783">118</xref></sup> in its proper season. The fact that God plagued those who ate the paschal lamb in a manner contrary to what is written<sup><xref rid="fn1784">119</xref></sup> is proof of this. If the Passover observed by Hezekiah was not celebrated in its proper time and was therefore not acceptable to the Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn1785">120</xref></sup> why did He plague them?<sup><xref rid="fn1786">121</xref></sup> If Hezekiah sinned how is it that he prayed on their behalf<sup><xref rid="fn1787">122</xref></sup> and the Lord accepted his supplication and healed the people?<sup><xref rid="fn1788">123</xref></sup> The answer to one who would argue that the sages of blessed memory did not maintain<sup><xref rid="fn1789">124</xref></sup> that Hezekiah acted properly in adding another month during the month of Nisan<sup><xref rid="fn1790">125</xref></sup> is: they<sup><xref rid="fn1791">126</xref></sup> spoke the truth. It is the custom of every Bet Din to ascertain at the end of the month of Adar whether it is necessary<sup><xref rid="fn1792">127</xref></sup> to add another month to the year or not. Now Hezekiah did not do this; he committed a small error in adding another month to the year at the beginning of the month.<sup><xref rid="fn1793">128</xref></sup> Now since the additional month<sup><xref rid="fn1794">129</xref></sup> always comes before the first month,<sup><xref rid="fn1795">130</xref></sup> the latter is always the first of the months, and the festivals<sup><xref rid="fn1796">131</xref></sup> will fall in the seventh month from it.<sup><xref rid="fn1797">132</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>it shall be the first month of the year to you</italic> (v. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn1798">133</xref></sup> We know that many commandments are in memory of the Exodus from Egypt. Behold, it is therefore fitting that the Exodus be the first reference point in Israel&#x2019;s calculations. Thus it is written, <italic>And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year&#x2026;in the month Ziv, which is the second month</italic> (I Kings 6:1).</p>
<p>The gentiles ask, if the year is made up of months and the month of spring is its foundation and beginning, why do you calculate your years from the seventh month and say that a new year begins on its first day?<sup><xref rid="fn1799">134</xref></sup> The answer is that our sages of blessed memory have already noted<sup><xref rid="fn1800">135</xref></sup> that there are four new year days.<sup><xref rid="fn1801">136</xref></sup> We clearly see that the sanctification of the jubilee year is <italic>on the tenth day of the seventh month</italic> (Lev. 25:9).<sup><xref rid="fn1802">137</xref></sup> Furthermore, God commanded that the Torah be read <italic>in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles</italic> (Deut. 31:10)&#x2026;<italic>that they may hear, and that they may learn</italic> (Deut. 31:12). Now if the beginning of the year of release is reckoned from Nisan, why didn&#x2019;t God command that the Torah be read during the festival of unleavened bread? Now they were idle for half a year.<sup><xref rid="fn1803">138</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>and the feast of ingathering</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1804">139</xref></sup> <italic>at the turn of the year</italic> (Ex. 34:22). <sup><xref rid="fn1805">140</xref></sup> Elsewhere it states,<sup><xref rid="fn1806">141</xref></sup> <italic>at the end of the year</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1807">142</xref></sup> <italic>when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field</italic> (Ex. 23:16). Additionally, we can derive the aforementioned<sup><xref rid="fn1808">143</xref></sup> from the way the Torah speaks and from the way nature acts. The Torah first states,<sup><xref rid="fn1809">144</xref></sup> <italic>ye shall not sow</italic> and afterwards says, <italic>neither</italic> (shall ye) <italic>reap</italic> (Lev. 25:12). The season of sowing is close to Tishri,<sup><xref rid="fn1810">145</xref></sup> not Nisan. Furthermore, if we reckon the beginning of the year of release from Nisan he who sowed in the sixth year<sup><xref rid="fn1811">146</xref></sup> will not harvest in the seventh year, because the harvest falls after Nisan when the year of release has already started.<sup><xref rid="fn1812">147</xref></sup> He will also not sow in the year of release.<sup><xref rid="fn1813">148</xref></sup> We thus see that the words of our sages are correct.<sup><xref rid="fn1814">149</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE BEGINNING OF MONTHS. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen<sup><xref rid="fn1815">150</xref></sup> says that there is no need to use the term <italic>rosh chodesh</italic> (new moon). The term <italic>chodesh</italic> suffices,<sup><xref rid="fn1816">151</xref></sup> since the meaning of <italic>chodesh</italic> is the day that the light of the moon is renewed. Scripture thus states, <italic>chodesh ve-shabbat</italic> (New moon and sabbath) (Is. 1:13); <italic>chodshekhem u-mo&#x2019;adekhem</italic> (your new moons and your appointed seasons) (Is. 1:14); <italic>mi-de chodesh be-chodsho</italic> (from one new moon to another) (Is. 66:23). Others argued with him and asked, if this be the case, then why does Scripture state, <italic>ba-chodesh hashe&#x2019;vi&#x2019;i be-echad la-chodesh</italic> (And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month) (Num. 29:1)?<sup><xref rid="fn1817">152</xref></sup> Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen answered, to remove doubt.<sup><xref rid="fn1818">153</xref></sup> They also quoted, <italic>u-ve-roshe chodshekhem</italic> (and in your new moons) (Num. 28:11) against him.<sup><xref rid="fn1819">154</xref></sup> He answered that Scripture speaks of the month of Nisan throughout the years,<sup><xref rid="fn1820">155</xref></sup> for only Nisan is the chief new moon.<sup><xref rid="fn1821">156</xref></sup> They then asked him, if so, then what sacrifices are we to offer on other new moons?<sup><xref rid="fn1822">157</xref></sup> He answered that Scripture states in the very same portion, <italic>This is the burnt-offering of every new moon throughout the months of the year</italic> (Num. 28:14).<sup><xref rid="fn1823">158</xref></sup> Scripture likewise states, <italic>Also in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in your new moons</italic> (u-ve-roshe chodshekhem),<sup><xref rid="fn1824">159</xref></sup> <italic>ye shall blow with the trumpets</italic> (Num. 10:10) because it is the beginning of the year.<sup><xref rid="fn1825">160</xref></sup> However, we<sup><xref rid="fn1826">161</xref></sup> will not set aside the words of our rabbis of blessed memory because of our own opinions. Our sages said that we sound the trumpets on the new moon of every month.<sup><xref rid="fn1827">162</xref></sup> It is correct to say <italic>chodesh</italic> or <italic>rosh chodesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1828">163</xref></sup> It is written, <italic>ad chodesh yamim</italic> (but a whole month) (Num. 11:20), the meaning of which is: until the days of the month are complete.<sup><xref rid="fn1829">164</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. SPEAK YE UNTO ALL THE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. For all those who are obligated to observe the commandments<sup><xref rid="fn1830">165</xref></sup> are required to do this.<sup><xref rid="fn1831">166</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEY SHALL TAKE. Whoever has cattle shall take from his cattle, as the Israelites had a lot of cattle. Or <italic>yikchu</italic> (they shall take) means they shall buy. Yefet says that they should start preparing the lamb on the tenth day and do so till the fourteenth day.<sup><xref rid="fn1832">167</xref></sup> However, we do not know<sup><xref rid="fn1833">168</xref></sup> whether this is a command for all generations or pertained only to the Passover observed in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn1834">169</xref></sup></p>
<p>A LAMB, ACCORDING TO THEIR FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSES. If they be few.<sup><xref rid="fn1835">170</xref></sup></p>
<p>A LAMB FOR A HOUSEHOLD. If they be many.<sup><xref rid="fn1836">171</xref></sup> After stating, <italic>a lamb, according to their fathers&#x2019; houses</italic>, Scripture says a lamb for each and every household.<sup><xref rid="fn1837">172</xref></sup> I have already explained the meaning of <italic>bayit</italic> (household) at the beginning of this book.<sup><xref rid="fn1838">173</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND IF THE HOUSEHOLD BE TOO LITTLE FOR A LAMB. Too little to eat a lamb because the members of the household are few. Then he and his neighbor shall take a lamb.</p>
<p>ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE SOULS. <italic>Mikhsat</italic> (number of) means a portion.<sup><xref rid="fn1839">174</xref></sup> The word <italic>mekhes</italic> (tribute) in <italic>And the Lord&#x2019;s tribute</italic> (Num. 31:37) in which <italic>mekhes</italic> refers to the portion which each one shall take, is similar. So too the word <italic>kosi</italic> (portion) in <italic>O Lord, the share of mine inheritance and my portion</italic> (Ps. 16:5).<sup><xref rid="fn1840">175</xref></sup> This is also the meaning of <italic>takhosu</italic> (ye shall make your count).<sup><xref rid="fn1841">176</xref></sup> It comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn1842">177</xref></sup> The doubled letter is missing in the word <italic>be-mikhsat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1843">178</xref></sup> and also in <italic>mekhes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1844">179</xref></sup> Scripture follows the paradigm of <italic>memer</italic> (bitterness) in <italic>And bitterness to her that bore him</italic> (Prov. 17:25), which comes from a double root<sup><xref rid="fn1845">180</xref></sup> in its vocalization of <italic>mekhes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1846">181</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. YOUR LAMB SHALL BE WITHOUT BLEMISH. It shall be without any deformity. The word <italic>seh</italic> (lamb) also applies to the two kinds<sup><xref rid="fn1847">182</xref></sup> taken in by the term <italic>tzon</italic> (flock).<sup><xref rid="fn1848">183</xref></sup> <italic>Sehkhevasim ve-seh izzim</italic> (the sheep and the goat) (Deut. 14:4) is similar.</p>
<p>Rabbi Moses ben Amram Ha-Parsi<sup><xref rid="fn1849">184</xref></sup> says that the obligation to offer a lamb only pertains to the Passover brought in Egypt. However, in the Land of Israel one could sacrifice a lamb or a bull. He offers as proof, <italic>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the Lord thy God, of the flock and the herd</italic> (Deut. 16:2), which applies to the Passover to be offered in all future generations. However, he did speak correctly. All future Passover offerings are in memory of the paschal lamb offered in Egypt, and one should not deviate from it. The meaning of the aforementioned verse can only be: <italic>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering unto the Lord thy God of the flock</italic> as an obligation; <italic>and of the herd</italic>, bring peace offerings to be eaten cooked in water. Similarly, <italic>And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter</italic> (Deut. 16:14) means thou art obligated;<sup><xref rid="fn1850">185</xref></sup> thy son and thy daughter are permitted to do so. Proof of the above is found in the book of Chronicles.<sup><xref rid="fn1851">186</xref></sup> We read there that on the fourteenth day<sup><xref rid="fn1852">187</xref></sup> they slaughtered lambs and bullocks.<sup><xref rid="fn1853">188</xref></sup> It is written there that the lambs were for Passover offerings<sup><xref rid="fn1854">189</xref></sup> and the bullocks which served as peace offerings were cooked in pots and caldrons.<sup><xref rid="fn1855">190</xref></sup> Only those sacrifices which came from the flock were roasted in the fire according to ordinance.<sup><xref rid="fn1856">191</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua says that there is a difference between <italic>ben shanah</italic> (of the first year)<sup><xref rid="fn1857">192</xref></sup> and <italic>ben shenato</italic> (of the first year). A <italic>ben shanah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1858">193</xref></sup> has lived a year and <italic>ben shenato</italic> means exactly what Scripture says.<sup><xref rid="fn1859">194</xref></sup> Now with regard to the sacrifices offered by the princes it first states, <italic>keves echad ben shenato leolah</italic> (one he-lamb of the first year, for a burnt-offering) (Num. 7:15) and then states, <italic>kevasim bene shanah</italic> (he-lambs of the first year) (Num. 7:87).<sup><xref rid="fn1860">195</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND YE SHALL KEEP IT. Each one shall keep it in his house.</p>
<p>AT DUSK. <italic>Ben ha-arbayim</italic> (at dusk) is a difficult phrase. Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn1861">196</xref></sup> says that it refers to the moment after midday that the sun moves to the west. He does not explain why <italic>arbayim</italic> is in the dual form.<sup><xref rid="fn1862">197</xref></sup> Now, Scripture states, <italic>And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at dusk</italic> (ben ha-arbayim) (Ex. 30:8), and there is no doubt that Aaron is to light the lamps when the sun sets.<sup><xref rid="fn1863">198</xref></sup> Now, when we researched this phrase we found that Scripture refers to the moment of <italic>ben ha-arbayim</italic> as <italic>erev</italic> (evening).<sup><xref rid="fn1864">199</xref></sup> For it is clearly written, <italic>At dusk</italic> (ben ha-arbayim) <italic>ye shall eat flesh</italic> (Ex. 16:12), and it is there stated, <italic>when the Lord shall give you in the evening</italic> (ba-erev) <italic>flesh to eat</italic> (Ex. 16:8). Likewise, concerning the lighting of the lamps it is written: <italic>Aaron and his sons shall set it in order, to burn from evening</italic> (erev) <italic>to morning before the Lord</italic> (Ex. 27:21).<sup><xref rid="fn1865">200</xref></sup> It is similarly written, <italic>even burnt-offerings mornings and evening</italic> (erev) (Ezra 3:3), and it is stated, <italic>The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at dusk</italic> (ben ha-arbayim) (Ex. 29:39). Now concerning the Passover sacrifice, about which the term <italic>ben ha-arbayim</italic> (at dusk) is employed, we find that Scripture states, <italic>there thou shalt sacrifice the passover-offering at even</italic> (erev), <italic>at the coming</italic> (bo)<sup><xref rid="fn1866">201</xref></sup> <italic>of the sun, at the season that thou earnest forth out of Egypt</italic> (Deut. 16:6). Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn1867">202</xref></sup> explains that the reference is to the time that the sun comes to the west.<sup><xref rid="fn1868">203</xref></sup> However, this is not the meaning of <italic>bo</italic>. It refers to the opposite of the sun&#x2019;s going forth upon the earth<sup><xref rid="fn1869">204</xref></sup> since it is written, <italic>the sun went out</italic> (yatza) <italic>upon the earth</italic> (Gen. 19:23),<sup><xref rid="fn1870">205</xref></sup> which means the time that the sun first begins to be seen on the earth. Similarly, <italic>And when the sun comes</italic> (ba) <italic>he shall be clean</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1871">206</xref></sup> (Lev. 22:7) means when the sun shall no longer be seen upon the ground. Now it is written concerning a nocturnal seminal emission, <italic>But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun comes</italic> (u-khe-vo ha-shemesh)<sup><xref rid="fn1872">207</xref></sup> <italic>he may come within the camp</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1873">208</xref></sup> (Deut. 23:12). If this is not so, then let Rabbi Solomon explain what difference there is between &#x201C;when the sun comes&#x201D; with regard to Passover and &#x201C;when the sun comes&#x201D; with regard to a nocturnal seminal emission. It is the same with <italic>and when the sun comes he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1874">209</xref></sup> <italic>shall be clean</italic> (Lev. 22:7).<sup><xref rid="fn1875">210</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Sadducees<sup><xref rid="fn1876">211</xref></sup> say that there are three evenings.<sup><xref rid="fn1877">212</xref></sup> Their proof is from a verse which they found to read, <italic>ha-erev ha-shelishit</italic> (the third evening)<sup><xref rid="fn1878">213</xref></sup> (I Sam. 20:5). However, they do not recognize or understand the truth. It is written, <italic>Tomorrow is the new moon&#x2026;And in the third day thou shalt hide thyself well</italic> (I Sam. 20:18, 19), the meaning of which is: when close to evening of the third day starting from today comes, you shall hide yourself well in the field where you are presently hidden. It is because of this that Jonathan said, <italic>until the third evening</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1879">214</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will now backtrack and explain.<sup><xref rid="fn1880">215</xref></sup> Know that the word <italic>arbayim</italic> is always vocalized according to the paradigm of the dual forms like <italic>ovnayim</italic> (birthstool) (Ex. 1:16). <italic>Luchotayim</italic> (planks) (Ezek. 27:5) is similar. So is <italic>derachayim</italic> (ways) (Prov. 28:18), as <italic>But he that is perverse in his ways</italic> (derachayim) <italic>shall fall in one of them</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>) proves.<sup><xref rid="fn1881">216</xref></sup> The same is the case with the word <italic>shamayim</italic> (heaven), as the heavens consist of two poles<sup><xref rid="fn1882">217</xref></sup> which are like fastened nails upon which the sphere leans. I have already explained in <italic>The Book of God</italic>, the Glorious,<sup><xref rid="fn1883">218</xref></sup> that the word <italic>shamayim</italic> comes from the same root as the word <italic>sham</italic> (there) in <italic>There the upright might reason with Him</italic> (Job 23:7).<sup><xref rid="fn1884">219</xref></sup> The term <italic>shamayim</italic> alludes to these two places.<sup><xref rid="fn1885">220</xref></sup></p>
<p>We thus have two evenings: one when the sun sets, that is, the time when the sun descends beneath the earth; the second when its light disappears from the clouds.<sup><xref rid="fn1886">221</xref></sup> Now there is close to one and a third hours between them. It is at this time<sup><xref rid="fn1887">222</xref></sup> that one who experienced a seminal emission<sup><xref rid="fn1888">223</xref></sup> may enter the camp and Aaron kindles the lights.<sup><xref rid="fn1889">224</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon, of blessed memory, says that the altar of the burnt offering measured five cubits in length and five cubits in width. Such an area has room only for a small number of <italic>kohanim</italic> (priests), who are the ones that sprinkle the blood from the paschal lambs before it coagulates. Now in the days of Josiah,<sup><xref rid="fn1890">225</xref></sup> when the number of Israelites were few,<sup><xref rid="fn1891">226</xref></sup> the <italic>kohanim</italic> were not able to sprinkle the blood of the Passover offerings and the peace offerings that they slaughtered; i.e., they were not able to sprinkle them on the altar in one and a third hours.<sup><xref rid="fn1892">227</xref></sup> How much more unable to do so were they when all the tribes were in their country.<sup><xref rid="fn1893">228</xref></sup> There was thus a tradition that they begin to slaughter<sup><xref rid="fn1894">229</xref></sup> from the moment that it became clear to a person that the sun turned to the west.<sup><xref rid="fn1895">230</xref></sup> Scripture speaks of <italic>ben ha-arbayim</italic> (at dusk)<sup><xref rid="fn1896">231</xref></sup> because most of the paschal lambs were slaughtered then,<sup><xref rid="fn1897">232</xref></sup> and that marks its time limit;<sup><xref rid="fn1898">233</xref></sup> for one should not wait until the going down of the sun&#x2019;s light.<sup><xref rid="fn1899">234</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. ON THE TWO SIDE-POSTS. Of the door of the house. Moses will go on to explain<sup><xref rid="fn1900">235</xref></sup> how they are to take the blood.</p>
<p>[LINTEL.] The word <italic>mashkof</italic> (lintel) means a window.<sup><xref rid="fn1901">236</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>va-yashkef</italic> (looked) (Gen. 26:8).<sup><xref rid="fn1902">237</xref></sup> This window was in the door.<sup><xref rid="fn1903">238</xref></sup> This is the custom in all Moslem countries. The practice of the uncircumcised<sup><xref rid="fn1904">239</xref></sup> differs from that of the Egyptians<sup><xref rid="fn1905">240</xref></sup> even regarding food,<sup><xref rid="fn1906">241</xref></sup> an example being, <italic>Thou shalt break it in pieces</italic> (Lev. 2:6).<sup><xref rid="fn1907">242</xref></sup> Similarly with regard to women&#x2019;s jewelry such as the wearing of nose rings and earrings and all that the prophet Isaiah mentioned concerning the daughters of Zion (Is. 3:18-24).<sup><xref rid="fn1908">243</xref></sup> Likewise, all of their houses<sup><xref rid="fn1909">244</xref></sup> without exception are built in courtyards. One entrance is called the door to the house and the other the gate of the courtyard.</p>
<p>Many say that the purpose of placing the blood on the window and on the two side-posts was to demonstrate publicly that they slaughtered the abomination of Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn1910">245</xref></sup> since by then the fear of the Israelites had fallen on the Egyptians, and the Israelites were not afraid of being stoned.<sup><xref rid="fn1911">246</xref></sup> Now if this was the case then the blood should have been placed on the entrance to the courtyard.<sup><xref rid="fn1912">247</xref></sup> However, the blood was placed in secret, for they closed the gate of the courtyard. Furthermore, they slaughtered the lamb at dusk, which is close to night, so that no one would see them. Moreover, no man left his house until the morning when each one went on his way and each one closed the gate to his courtyard. The Egyptians thought that the Israelites would return.<sup><xref rid="fn1913">248</xref></sup> The reason the blood was smeared on the window was to make atonement<sup><xref rid="fn1914">249</xref></sup> for all those eating in the house and to serve as a mark for the destroyer<sup><xref rid="fn1915">250</xref></sup> to see. It is to be understood in the same way as <italic>and set a mark on the foreheads of the men</italic> (Ezek. 9:4).<sup><xref rid="fn1916">251</xref></sup></p>
<p>[HOUSES.] The word <italic>battim</italic> (houses) is grammatically irregular, as it has a <italic>dagesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1917">252</xref></sup> following a long <italic>kamatz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1918">253</xref></sup> This is contrary to the rule<sup><xref rid="fn1919">254</xref></sup> whereby a <italic>dagesh</italic> is only placed after a short <italic>kamatz</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1920">255</xref></sup> as in <italic>ronnu</italic> (sing)<sup><xref rid="fn1921">256</xref></sup> in <italic>Sing, O ye heavens</italic> (Is. 44:23). Perhaps <italic>battim</italic> was vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1922">257</xref></sup> because of the missing <italic>yod</italic> in the word <italic>bayit</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1923">258</xref></sup> This form<sup><xref rid="fn1924">259</xref></sup> would thus not be confused with the form <italic>battim</italic> (baths) in <italic>ten baths are a homer</italic> (Ezek. 45:14) wherein <italic>battim</italic>, the plural of <italic>bat</italic> (bath) in <italic>The ephah and the bath</italic> (Ezek. 45:11), is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> in the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn1925">260</xref></sup> The word <italic>battim</italic> (houses) in <italic>upon the houses</italic> is indicative,<sup><xref rid="fn1926">261</xref></sup> for unlike the rule it is penultimately accented.<sup><xref rid="fn1927">262</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. WITH BITTER HERBS THEY SHALL EAT IT. One of the Spanish wise men explained that it is well known that because of the Nile and the lack of rain, the humidity in Egypt is very high and the air is always moist. It was therefore their custom to eat all sorts of bitter herbs and mustards with their meals. An Egyptian always had bitters in which to dip his bread, even if he had but one loaf of bread, because the bitters are a cure for their climate.<sup><xref rid="fn1928">263</xref></sup> However, we will rely on the opinion of our ancients of blessed memory, who explained to us that the reason for the bitter herbs is to remind us that <italic>they made their lives bitter</italic> (Ex. 1:14).<sup><xref rid="fn1929">264</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. RAW. Some say that the meaning of <italic>na</italic> (raw) is: as it is now,<sup><xref rid="fn1930">265</xref></sup> i.e., when the meat is raw. However, we do not find the word <italic>na</italic> used in such a way elsewhere in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1931">266</xref></sup> Others say<sup><xref rid="fn1932">267</xref></sup> that it comes from the same root as <italic>heni</italic> (breaks)<sup><xref rid="fn1933">268</xref></sup> in <italic>But if her father breaks her vow</italic> (Num. 30:6) and means broken.<sup><xref rid="fn1934">269</xref></sup> However, this is incorrect, as Scripture later states, <italic>neither shall ye break a bone thereof</italic> (v. 46).<sup><xref rid="fn1935">270</xref></sup> However, in my opinion the word <italic>na</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1936">271</xref></sup> has no counterpart in Scripture. It means the opposite of cooked and is<sup><xref rid="fn1937">272</xref></sup> referred to as <italic>chai</italic> (raw). Compare, <italic>For he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw</italic> (chai) (I Sam. 2:15). I have previously noted that most of Arabic is similar to Hebrew.<sup><xref rid="fn1938">273</xref></sup> Now in Arabic raw meat is called <italic>nayy</italic>, and the <italic>alef heh, vav</italic>, and <italic>yod</italic> interchange in the tongue of the Arabs as it does in our tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn1939">274</xref></sup></p>
<p>NOR SODDEN. <italic>Bashel</italic> (sodden) is an adjective. Here its meaning is, that which is sodden with water.<sup><xref rid="fn1940">275</xref></sup> That which is roasted in fire is also called <italic>mevushal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1941">276</xref></sup> for it is written, <italic>And thou shalt roast</italic> (u-vishalta)<sup><xref rid="fn1942">277</xref></sup> <italic>and eat it</italic> (Deut. 16:7) and, <italic>And they roasted</italic> (va-yevashelu)<sup><xref rid="fn1943">278</xref></sup> <italic>the passover with fire according to the ordinance</italic> (II Chron. 35:13). It is possible that <italic>nor sodden at all with water</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1944">279</xref></sup> means nor cooked, that is, cooked in water, as a royal dish is sodden in liquids. They place a wide copper utensil on the fire and fill half of it with water. When the water boils they place the pot with the meat in cold water above the boiling water. Thus is the meat cooked.<sup><xref rid="fn1945">280</xref></sup> This dish is better than one prepared close to the fire.</p>
<p>I the writer<sup><xref rid="fn1946">281</xref></sup> add to the words of this scholar what I heard from his very own mouth.<sup><xref rid="fn1947">282</xref></sup> <italic>Bashel</italic> (sodden)<sup><xref rid="fn1948">283</xref></sup> is an adjective<sup><xref rid="fn1949">284</xref></sup> following the paradigm of <italic>kaved</italic> (heavy) and <italic>zaken</italic> (old). The term <italic>bashel</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1950">285</xref></sup> here is similar,<sup><xref rid="fn1951">286</xref></sup> as its <italic>bet</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn1952">287</xref></sup> is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> and its <italic>shin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1953">288</xref></sup> has no <italic>dagesh. Bashel</italic> is not an infinitive<sup><xref rid="fn1954">289</xref></sup> like <italic>kabbed</italic> (promote) in <italic>for I will promote thee</italic> (Num. 22:17) or <italic>hakkeh</italic> (smite) in <italic>thou shalt surely smite</italic> (Deut. 13:16), as the infinitive is not joined to a word unless it is a perfect or an imperfect. Compare, <italic>dabber yedabber</italic> (speak well) (Ex. 4:14),<sup><xref rid="fn1955">290</xref></sup> and <italic>hakdesh hikdashti</italic> (I verily dedicate) (Jud. 17:3).<sup><xref rid="fn1956">291</xref></sup> However, the infinitive is never joined with the <italic>po&#x2019;el</italic> or <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic>. <sup><xref rid="fn1957">292</xref></sup> Thus <italic>bashel</italic> (sodden) is similar to <italic>kaved</italic> (heavy).<sup><xref rid="fn1958">293</xref></sup> Its feminine form is <italic>beshelah</italic>, as in <italic>the shoulder&#x2026;when it is sodden</italic> (beshelah) (Num. 6:19). Do not ask what need Scripture had to use the two terms <italic>bashel</italic> and <italic>mevushal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1959">294</xref></sup> As the scholar<sup><xref rid="fn1960">295</xref></sup> pointed out,<sup><xref rid="fn1961">296</xref></sup> there are two soddenings, one of which is<sup><xref rid="fn1962">297</xref></sup> the placing of the utensil with the meat in the midst of the boiling water.</p>
<p>The plural of <italic>bashel mevushal</italic> is <italic>beshelim mevushalim</italic>. Compare, <italic>chakhamim mechukkamim</italic> (exceeding wise) in <italic>But they are exceeding wise</italic> (Prov. 30:24). The singular form is <italic>chakham mechukkam</italic>. Compare, <italic>barukh u-mevorakh</italic> (exceedingly blessed). There is a difference in nuance from a grammatical standpoint between <italic>chakham</italic> (a wise man) and <italic>mechukkam</italic> (one who has become wise).<sup><xref rid="fn1963">298</xref></sup> There is, as the scholar explained,<sup><xref rid="fn1964">299</xref></sup> a similar difference between <italic>bashel</italic> (sodden)<sup><xref rid="fn1965">300</xref></sup> and <italic>mevushal</italic> (sodden).<sup><xref rid="fn1966">301</xref></sup></p>
<p>ITS HEAD WITH ITS LEGS AND WITH THE INWARDS THEREOF. The word <italic>al</italic> has the meaning of with.<sup><xref rid="fn1967">302</xref></sup> The word <italic>al</italic> in <italic>And they came, both men and</italic> (al) <italic>women</italic> (Ex. 35:22) is similar. The head and the legs are to be washed in water<sup><xref rid="fn1968">303</xref></sup> as the ordinance requires.<sup><xref rid="fn1969">304</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. BUT THAT WHICH REMAINETH OF IT&#x2026;BURN WITH FIRE. If one was unable to eat one&#x2019;s portion due to circumstances beyond one&#x2019;s control. Yefet says that the reference is to the bones. However, Scripture only speaks of what is normal.<sup><xref rid="fn1970">305</xref></sup></p>
<p>[11. AND THUS SHALL YE EAT IT.] The reference is only to the paschal lamb eaten in Egypt. However, those in Argalon<sup><xref rid="fn1971">306</xref></sup> do the same today in memory of the Exodus. These spiritual errants all leave their land on the fifteenth day in memory of the Exodus.</p>
<p>11. AND YOUR STAFF IN YOUR HAND. To lead the asses.<sup><xref rid="fn1972">307</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>and he smote the ass with his staff</italic> (Num. 22:27).<sup><xref rid="fn1973">308</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN HASTE.] Israel was not to delay.<sup><xref rid="fn1974">309</xref></sup> They were to hurry and eat the paschal lamb before the moment of destruction arrived,<sup><xref rid="fn1975">310</xref></sup> when God would pass over their homes.<sup><xref rid="fn1976">311</xref></sup> God therefore commanded that the lamb be roasted in fire, because food that is roasted cooks quickly. The holy patriarchs<sup><xref rid="fn1977">312</xref></sup> similarly said the paschal lamb may be eaten only until midnight and it may only be eaten roasted.<sup><xref rid="fn1978">313</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. FOR I WILL GO THROUGH THE LAND OF EGYPT. God&#x2019;s might and His power passed throughout the land. Hence it was as if God Himself went throughout the land.<sup><xref rid="fn1979">314</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND AGAINST ALL THE GODS OF EGYPT I WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENTS. In the manner of <italic>Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground</italic> (I Sam. 5:4). It is similarly written, <italic>upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments</italic> (Num. 33:4).</p>
<p>[13. AND THE BLOOD SHALL BE TO YOU FOR A TOKEN.] This<sup><xref rid="fn1980">315</xref></sup> shall be for you a token so that your hearts will be strong and will not weaken as you hear the cries of the Egyptians when their first-born die via the destroyer.</p>
<p>[AND WHEN I SEE THE BLOOD.] I will pass over you and there will be no plague among you because I will see the blood. The blood will be a sign to the destroyer.<sup><xref rid="fn1981">316</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THIS DAY SHALL BE UNTO YOU. It shall be a memorial for generations.</p>
<p>AND YE SHALL KEEP IT A FEAST. The reference is to the feast of Passover.<sup><xref rid="fn1982">317</xref></sup> Scripture says that it shall be kept a feast by an ordinance throughout your generations. However, it does not say that it is to be kept in all of your dwelling places, because this commandment is, as I will explain, contingent on dwelling in the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>15. SEVEN DAYS SHALL YE EAT UNLEAVENED BREAD. The reason for <italic>shall ye eat unleavened bread</italic> is to recall the <italic>matzot</italic> eaten when they left Egypt. They were not previously commanded to eat unleavened bread save for that which is to be eaten with the paschal lamb before midnight.<sup><xref rid="fn1983">318</xref></sup> However, God now commanded that they eat unleavened bread for seven days<sup><xref rid="fn1984">319</xref></sup> in memory of what happened to them when they left Egypt, as it is written there,<sup><xref rid="fn1985">320</xref></sup> <italic>for it was not leavened</italic> (Ex. 12:39). Had the Egyptians permitted them to tarry a bit, they would have leavened their dough. They ate unleavened bread for seven days until Pharaoh was drowned on the seventh day. The heavenly cloud led them day and night and they did not tarry very long even when they camped.<sup><xref rid="fn1986">321</xref></sup> It is similarly written when discussing the paschal lamb,<sup><xref rid="fn1987">322</xref></sup> <italic>seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction</italic> (Deut. 16:3). Now according to its plain meaning, the text <italic>Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread</italic> is stating an obligation.<sup><xref rid="fn1988">323</xref></sup> <italic>That thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life</italic> (Deut. 16:3) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn1989">324</xref></sup> It is because of this<sup><xref rid="fn1990">325</xref></sup> that Scripture states, <italic>Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread</italic> (Ex. 12:20), as the latter<sup><xref rid="fn1991">326</xref></sup> is an obligation within the Land of Israel and outside of the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>[HOWBEIT THE FIRST DAY YE SHALL PUT AWAY LEAVEN OUT OF YOUR HOUSES.] Now since Israel had a tradition of commencing the slaughter of the paschal lamb when the sun started going down towards the west, and it is written, <italic>Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread</italic> (Ex. 34:25), the rabbis of blessed memory interpreted the word <italic>ach</italic> (howbeit) to mean a part of.<sup><xref rid="fn1992">327</xref></sup> Mark the fact that ceasing an act is not an act. The meaning of <italic>And on the seventh day God finished</italic> (Gen. 2:2) is: when the seventh day started God had already finished his work.<sup><xref rid="fn1993">328</xref></sup> Similarly, the meaning of <italic>the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses</italic> is: when the first day starts, all leaven shall already have been removed from the houses. Now <italic>the first day</italic> starts at the end of the fourteenth day at even, as it is written, <italic>from the first day until the seventh day</italic>. The meaning of the phrase<sup><xref rid="fn1994">329</xref></sup> then is that the seven full days<sup><xref rid="fn1995">330</xref></sup> are from the fourteenth day of the month at even, which is the end of the fourteenth day, until the twenty-first day at even. I will yet speak concerning this.</p>
<p>16. AND IN THE FIRST DAY. The day of the Exodus from Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn1996">331</xref></sup> The seventh day is, as I will explain, the day that the Egyptians drowned.</p>
<p>NO MANNER OF WORK. We do not find the phrase <italic>kol melakhah</italic> (no manner of work) stated with regard to any of the festivals,<sup><xref rid="fn1997">332</xref></sup> with the exception of the Sabbath and the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn1998">333</xref></sup> However, the phrase<sup><xref rid="fn1999">334</xref></sup> is employed with regard to Passover<sup><xref rid="fn2000">335</xref></sup> with the proviso that <italic>that which every man must eat</italic> is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn2001">336</xref></sup> In all other places, be it Passover,<sup><xref rid="fn2002">337</xref></sup> Sha&#x2019;vu&#x2019;ot,<sup><xref rid="fn2003">338</xref></sup> the Day of Memorial,<sup><xref rid="fn2004">339</xref></sup> or the festival of Sukkot,<sup><xref rid="fn2005">340</xref></sup> Scripture employs the abridged form and states, <italic>ye shall do no manner of servile</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2006">341</xref></sup> <italic>work</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2007">342</xref></sup> Only in one place<sup><xref rid="fn2008">343</xref></sup> with regard to Passover is it stated that you shall do no manner of work under the first stated conditions.<sup><xref rid="fn2009">344</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND YE SHALL OBSERVE. God here commanded that the <italic>matzot</italic> be watched<sup><xref rid="fn2010">345</xref></sup> from the time of the harvest.<sup><xref rid="fn2011">346</xref></sup></p>
<p>[HAVE I BROUGHT.] Scripture reads, <italic>have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt</italic> although they had not yet left Egypt. This prophecy took place at the beginning of the month.<sup><xref rid="fn2012">347</xref></sup> It meaning is: you will say this in all of your generations.<sup><xref rid="fn2013">348</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. IN THE FIRST. Scripture uses an abridged form since it had already stated, <italic>it shall be the first month of the year to you</italic> (v. 2). The meaning of <italic>in the first</italic> thus is, in the first month. <italic>In the tenth, on the first day of the month</italic> (Gen. 8:5)<sup><xref rid="fn2014">349</xref></sup> is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2015">350</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. LEAVEN. <italic>Se&#x2019;or</italic> (leaven) refers to something which induces leavening. The substance is well known.<sup><xref rid="fn2016">351</xref></sup> Scripture then goes on to say, <italic>for whosoever eateth anything which is leavened</italic> (machmetzet).<sup><xref rid="fn2017">352</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that <italic>from the first day until the seventh day</italic> (v. 15) is not connected to what is adjacent, i.e., to <italic>shall be cut off</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2018">353</xref></sup> but rather is connected to<sup><xref rid="fn2019">354</xref></sup> <italic>for whosoever eateth leavened bread</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2020">355</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>of Solomon&#x2019;s reign over Israel</italic> (I Kings 6:1).<sup><xref rid="fn2021">356</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yefet says that some letters refer both to the word in which they are placed and to a word previously written, as in <italic>odem pitdah u-vareket</italic> (carnelian, topaz, and smaragd) (Ex. 28:17), which is to be interpreted as if written, <italic>odem u-pitdah u-vareket</italic> (carnelian, <span class="underline">and</span> topaz, and smaragd).<sup><xref rid="fn2022">357</xref></sup> The same is true of <italic>mi-yom ha-rishon ad yom ha-shevi&#x2019;i</italic> (from the first day until the seventh day).<sup><xref rid="fn2023">358</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHETHER HE BE A SOJOURNER.] Scripture already noted that whosoever <italic>eateth leavened bread</italic> from among the Israelites incurs the penalty of excision.<sup><xref rid="fn2024">359</xref></sup> Scripture now adds a sojourner who is a sincere proselyte.<sup><xref rid="fn2025">360</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. NOTHING LEAVENED. Scripture first mentions the punishment<sup><xref rid="fn2026">361</xref></sup> and then the warning.<sup><xref rid="fn2027">362</xref></sup> <italic>In all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread</italic> is not optional as <italic>Six days shall work be done</italic> (Ex. 35:2) is. On the contrary, it is an obligation so that one will remember.<sup><xref rid="fn2028">363</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND MOSES CALLED FOR ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL. So that they would tell the people.</p>
<p>AND TAKE YOU LAMBS. On the tenth day, as he was commanded by God.<sup><xref rid="fn2029">364</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND KILL THE PASSOVER LAMB.] The grammarian<sup><xref rid="fn2030">365</xref></sup> says that <italic>ve-shachatu</italic> (and kill) in <italic>and kill the passover lamb</italic> is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2031">366</xref></sup> However, he spoke incorrectly. <italic>Ve-shachatu</italic> (shall kill it) in <italic>and the whole congregation of Israel shall kill it</italic> (v. 6) is a <italic>kal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2032">367</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn2033">368</xref></sup> is properly vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath the <italic>shin</italic> because of the silent missing letter.<sup><xref rid="fn2034">369</xref></sup> However, <italic>ve-shachatu</italic> (and kill) in <italic>and kill the passover lamb</italic> is imperative in the <italic>kal</italic>. We do not find this root in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> in any place in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2035">370</xref></sup> The <italic>shin</italic> of <italic>ve-shachatu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2036">371</xref></sup> should have been vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2037">372</xref></sup> as <italic>miskhu</italic> (draw)<sup><xref rid="fn2038">373</xref></sup> is. However, since the <italic>shin</italic> is followed by a guttural<sup><xref rid="fn2039">374</xref></sup> it was vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>, as is Hebrew practice. Compare, <italic>bacharu</italic> (choose) in <italic>choose you</italic> (Josh. 24:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2040">375</xref></sup> There are many other similar instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2041">376</xref></sup> The <italic>shin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2042">377</xref></sup> is therefore vocalized with a long <italic>pattach</italic> in the imperative. Both words<sup><xref rid="fn2043">378</xref></sup> are from the same conjugation.<sup><xref rid="fn2044">379</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND YE SHALL TAKE. Moses now explains the manner in which the blood is to be taken and placed on the lintel.<sup><xref rid="fn2045">380</xref></sup></p>
<p>[A BUNCH OF.] The word <italic>aguddat</italic> means a bunch (of). Compare, <italic>la-aggudah</italic> (band) in <italic>and became one band</italic> (II Sam. 2:25). Rabbi Merinus says that the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>aguddah</italic> is appended,<sup><xref rid="fn2046">381</xref></sup> as <italic>aguddah</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>gedud</italic> (troop).<sup><xref rid="fn2047">382</xref></sup> Others say that the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>aguddah</italic> is a root letter<sup><xref rid="fn2048">383</xref></sup> like the <italic>alef</italic> in <italic>afuddato</italic> (skillfully woven)<sup><xref rid="fn2049">384</xref></sup> in <italic>and the skillfully woven band</italic> (Ex 28:6).</p>
<p>[HYSSOP.] Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>azov</italic> (hyssop) is a plant known in Arabic as <italic>zatr</italic> and in the vernacular as oregano. It is an herb distinguished by various kinds of flavors. However, this interpretation is incorrect, for Scripture states, <italic>even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall</italic> (I Kings 5:13).<sup><xref rid="fn2050">385</xref></sup> I do not know the identity of the <italic>azov</italic>. However, logically speaking it is not a very mighty plant for it is the opposite of the cedar mentioned in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2051">386</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BASIN.] Some say that they slaughtered the paschal lamb in the threshold of the gate,<sup><xref rid="fn2052">387</xref></sup> and they dipped the hyssop into it and then touched the side-posts with the blood. They say that the word <italic>saf</italic> (basin) is similar in meaning to the word <italic>saf</italic> (threshold) in <italic>and he measured the threshold</italic> (saf) <italic>of the gate</italic> (Ezek. 40:6)<sup><xref rid="fn2053">388</xref></sup> and to <italic>sippim</italic> (thresholds)<sup><xref rid="fn2054">389</xref></sup> in <italic>and the posts of the thresholds moved</italic> (Is. 6:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2055">390</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>saf</italic> (basin) is similar to <italic>sappot</italic> (basins) in <italic>brought beds, and basins</italic> (II Sam. 17:28) and that <italic>saf</italic> is a vessel over which they slaughtered the paschal lamb.</p>
<p>[UNTIL THE MORNING.] I will yet explain what this means.<sup><xref rid="fn2056">391</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND WILL NOT SUFFER. He will not suffer <italic>the destroyer. Yitten</italic> (will suffer)<sup><xref rid="fn2057">392</xref></sup> here is similar in meaning to <italic>netatikha</italic> (suffered I thee) in <italic>Therefore suffered I thee not</italic> (Gen. 20:6). Now, the destroyer is under God&#x2019;s power. If God allows him to come into their homes it is as if He gave him permission to do so.</p>
<p>24. AND YE SHALL OBSERVE THIS THING. Many are of the opinion that the placing of the blood on the lintel and on the two side-posts is an obligation for all generations because <italic>this thing</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2058">393</xref></sup> is connected to<sup><xref rid="fn2059">394</xref></sup> the taking of the hyssop and dipping it into the lamb&#x2019;s blood. Furthermore, Scripture afterwards states, <italic>for that he passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt</italic> (v. 27).<sup><xref rid="fn2060">395</xref></sup> This interpretation would be correct from a logical point of view were it not for the true tradition which states otherwise.<sup><xref rid="fn2061">396</xref></sup> The correct interpretation is that <italic>this thing</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2062">397</xref></sup> refers to <italic>and kill the passover lamb</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2063">398</xref></sup> The meaning of the children&#x2019;s question is,<sup><xref rid="fn2064">399</xref></sup> when your children will see their family in a group eating an entire lamb, whose bones one is prohibited to break, with its head, with its legs, and with the inwards thereof, unlike the custom on all other festivals, and from which a gentile, an uncircumcised one, a sojourner, and a hired servant may not eat, they will question you.<sup><xref rid="fn2065">400</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS. Moses now explains that the slaughter of the paschal lamb is contingent upon dwelling in the Land of Israel. Do not be troubled by the Passover observed by Israelites at Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn2066">401</xref></sup> That was a commandment from on high.<sup><xref rid="fn2067">402</xref></sup> They did not observe another Passover in the desert. At Mount Sinai they were in an inhabited land and were thus able to find unleavened bread. However, when they were in a land that no man passed through<sup><xref rid="fn2068">403</xref></sup> they only had manna.</p>
<p>26. AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS&#x2026;WHAT MEAN YE BY THIS SERVICE. The strange ritual that I noted.<sup><xref rid="fn2069">404</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. THAT YE SHALL SAY: IT IS THE SACRIFICE OF THE LORD&#x2019;S PASSOVER. The word <italic>pesach</italic> (passover) is to be rendered pity, as we find, <italic>paso&#x2019;ach ve-himlit</italic> (He will pity it and He will rescue it) (Is. 31:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2070">405</xref></sup> The lamb is termed <italic>pesach</italic> (passover), as in <italic>and kill the passover</italic> (pesach) (v. 21), because God had pity on the first-born of Israel because of the blood of the lamb. However, Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that the word <italic>pesach</italic> is derived from the word <italic>pi&#x2019;se&#x2019;ach</italic> (limp), since a lame person supports himself on his healthy leg.<sup><xref rid="fn2071">406</xref></sup> The destroyer acted in a similar manner. He exterminated the first-born in the Egyptian home and passed over<sup><xref rid="fn2072">407</xref></sup> the home of his Hebrew neighbor and did not destroy him. The term <italic>posechim</italic> (hopping) in <italic>How long will you keep hopping between two opinions</italic> (I Kings 18:20)<sup><xref rid="fn2073">408</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>28. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WENT AND DID SO. They took a lamb on the tenth day of the month. They did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron: <italic>This is the ordinance of the passover</italic> (v. 43).</p>
<p>29. AND IT CAME TO PASS AT MIDNIGHT. The reference is to the second half of the night.<sup><xref rid="fn2074">409</xref></sup></p>
<p>[UNTO THE FIRST-BORN OF THE CAPTIVE THAT WAS IN THE DUNGEON.] Yefet says that the captives who grind the millstone in prison during the day are put at night into a pit whose opening is covered with the millstone.<sup><xref rid="fn2075">410</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>behind the mill</italic> (Ex. 11:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2076">411</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. AND PHARAOH ROSE UP. He himself. <italic>But the Levites alone shall do the service</italic> (Num. 18:23), meaning the Levite himself, is similar.</p>
<p>FOR THERE WAS NOT A HOUSE WHERE THERE WAS NOT ONE DEAD. Scripture speaks of the majority of houses.<sup><xref rid="fn2077">412</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND HE CALLED. Logically speaking Moses and Aaron were not in the land of Rameses with the Israelites on the night of the fifteenth. On the contrary, they were in that part of Egypt in which was the royal seat where Pharaoh lived.<sup><xref rid="fn2078">413</xref></sup> Now Moses and Aaron left the doors of their homes at midnight<sup><xref rid="fn2079">414</xref></sup> in accordance with God&#x2019;s dictate.<sup><xref rid="fn2080">415</xref></sup> After Pharaoh gave the Israelites permission to go and worship God, Moses went with the servants of Pharaoh to Rameses to bring Israel out of Egypt. It is common knowledge in our time that there are six Persian miles<sup><xref rid="fn2081">416</xref></sup> between ancient Egypt, where Joseph&#x2019;s treasures are known to be until this very day, and Rameses. Now the Israelites began to leave Egypt in the morning,<sup><xref rid="fn2082">417</xref></sup> namely, at the break of dawn when the light of the sun is seen in the clouds. There is a full hour and a third between the moment that dawn breaks and sunrise. We find that it can be very dark and still be morning. Thus Scripture states, <italic>And she</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2083">418</xref></sup> <italic>lay down at his feet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2084">419</xref></sup> <italic>till the morning</italic> (Ruth 3:14), and then adds, <italic>before one could discern another</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2085">420</xref></sup> Now some Israelites exited Egypt at the break of dawn when, from the Torah&#x2019;s standpoint, it is still night until sunrise.<sup><xref rid="fn2086">421</xref></sup> This group was close to Egypt. Another group who were further from Egypt exited that very day.<sup><xref rid="fn2087">422</xref></sup> The Israelites constituted a very large congregation.<sup><xref rid="fn2088">423</xref></sup> It is more than eight Persian miles from one end of Rameses to another.<sup><xref rid="fn2089">424</xref></sup> Scripture therefore states in one place, <italic>the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2090">425</xref></sup> (Deut. 16:1), and elsewhere reads, <italic>This day ye go forth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2091">426</xref></sup> (Ex. 13:4). It is further stated, <italic>the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians</italic> (Num. 33:3),<sup><xref rid="fn2092">427</xref></sup> and it is there recorded, <italic>while the Egyptians were burying them that the Lord had smitten</italic>. Now the Egyptians buried their dead during the day. I have thus explained the meaning of morning.<sup><xref rid="fn2093">428</xref></sup></p>
<p>[31.] BOTH YE&#x2026;AS YE HAVE SAID. <italic>Our cattle also shall go with us</italic> (Ex. 10:26).</p>
<p>32. [AND BLESS ME ALSO.] Pharaoh asked them to bless him and pray for him.<sup><xref rid="fn2094">429</xref></sup></p>
<p>[ALSO.] Scripture reads <italic>also</italic> because Pharaoh, as Moses had foretold,<sup><xref rid="fn2095">430</xref></sup> gave them sacrifices.</p>
<p>33. WERE URGENT. <italic>Va-techezak</italic> (were urgent) is in the feminine,<sup><xref rid="fn2096">431</xref></sup> because the state of Egypt includes everything.<sup><xref rid="fn2097">432</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WE ARE ALL DEAD.] I have explained its meaning in my comments on <italic>lest he fall upon us with pestilence</italic> (Ex. 5:3).</p>
<p>34. THEIR KNEADING-TROUGHS. <italic>Misheret</italic> (kneading-trough) is a wooden vessel. Compare, <italic>mishartekha</italic> (thy kneading-trough) in <italic>thy basket and thy kneading-trough</italic> (Deut. 28:5). Their asses were laden with garments which they asked of the Egyptians.<sup><xref rid="fn2098">433</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID. Each one asked in accordance with his status. Thus we find that only the princes donated precious stones, spices, and oil for the work of the tabernacle (Ex. 35:27, 28).<sup><xref rid="fn2099">434</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. AND THEY DESPOILED. We do not find the root <italic>nun, tzadi, lamed</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn2100">435</xref></sup> in the <italic>kal</italic>. We find it only in the <italic>hifil</italic> and the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>. They<sup><xref rid="fn2101">436</xref></sup> are both transitive verbs because there is no difference in meaning between <italic>va-yenatzelu</italic> (and they despoiled)<sup><xref rid="fn2102">437</xref></sup> and <italic>va-yatzel</italic> (hath taken away)<sup><xref rid="fn2103">438</xref></sup> in <italic>Thus God hath taken away</italic> (Gen. 31:9) except that in the <italic>hifil</italic> the object<sup><xref rid="fn2104">439</xref></sup> is mentioned and in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> it is omitted.<sup><xref rid="fn2105">440</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED. The <italic>samekh</italic> in the word <italic>va-yisu</italic> (journeyed)<sup><xref rid="fn2106">441</xref></sup> should have received a <italic>dagesh</italic> to compensate for the missing <italic>nun</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2107">442</xref></sup> as the <italic>gimel</italic> in <italic>va-yiggeshu</italic> (and drew near)<sup><xref rid="fn2108">443</xref></sup> (Gen. 44:18) and the <italic>tav</italic> in <italic>va-yittenu</italic> (and they gave)<sup><xref rid="fn2109">444</xref></sup> (Gen. 35:4) do. It is possible that the <italic>dagesh</italic> was omitted to simplify enunciation.</p>
<p>FROM RAMESES. <italic>Rameses</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>resh</italic> and a <italic>sheva</italic> beneath the <italic>ayin</italic>. It is not a city<sup><xref rid="fn2110">445</xref></sup> but rather the name of a district.<sup><xref rid="fn2111">446</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO SUCCOTH. <italic>Sukkotah</italic> means: to Succoth.<sup><xref rid="fn2112">447</xref></sup></p>
<p>[MEN.] Scripture mentions men. There was no need to mention the women because there were as many women as there were men, maybe even more.<sup><xref rid="fn2113">448</xref></sup></p>
<p>BESIDE CHILDREN. <italic>Taf</italic> (children) refers to those under the age of twenty.<sup><xref rid="fn2114">449</xref></sup></p>
<p>[38.] AND A MIXED MULTITUDE. Of Egyptians who intermingled with them. They are the <italic>asafsuf</italic> (mixed multitude) who joined them.<sup><xref rid="fn2115">450</xref></sup></p>
<p>39. AND THEY BAKED. The dough which they brought out of Egypt had leaven in it.<sup><xref rid="fn2116">451</xref></sup> They did not bake it<sup><xref rid="fn2117">452</xref></sup> until they camped in Succoth.<sup><xref rid="fn2118">453</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. NOW THE TIME THAT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DWELT IN EGYPT WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS. There are many calculations<sup><xref rid="fn2119">454</xref></sup> in Scripture whose point of departure is unknown to us. I will now mention a few of them. <italic>And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto the king</italic> (II Sam. 15:7). Now Absalom was not then forty years old.<sup><xref rid="fn2120">455</xref></sup> Furthermore, King David&#x2019;s reign was not yet over.<sup><xref rid="fn2121">456</xref></sup> The commentaries tell us that the point of departure for this calculation is <italic>from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim</italic> (I Sam. 7:2).</p>
<p>It is stated, <italic>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year</italic> (Ezek. 1:1). Some say that Ezekiel was thirty years old when he began to prophesy.<sup><xref rid="fn2122">457</xref></sup> Others say that the reference is to the thirtieth year of the jubilee.<sup><xref rid="fn2123">458</xref></sup> Other say that its point of departure is the finding of the Torah which was discovered by Hilkiah the priest.<sup><xref rid="fn2124">459</xref></sup> However, I am uncertain, for they are opinions without foundation or support.</p>
<p>It is written: <italic>And within threescore and five years shall Ephraim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2125">460</xref></sup> <italic>be broken, that it be not a people</italic> (Is. 7:8). The latter prophesy was uttered during the days of Ahaz, whose reign lasted for sixteen years. Samaria was exiled in the sixth year of his son Hezekiah&#x2019;s reign.<sup><xref rid="fn2126">461</xref></sup> The commentaries were therefore forced to say that the sixty-five years start from the day that Amos prophesied, <italic>And Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land</italic> (Amos 7:11). Others say that its point of departure is the earthquake.<sup><xref rid="fn2127">462</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now when we investigated the years starting with the time that Israel came to Egypt in the days of Joseph and his brothers we found that they do not come to the number of years spoken of in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2128">463</xref></sup> There is no doubt that Kehat<sup><xref rid="fn2129">464</xref></sup> was among those who descended to Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2130">465</xref></sup> Let us imagine that Kehat<sup><xref rid="fn2131">466</xref></sup> begot his son Amram at the end of his life and that Amram<sup><xref rid="fn2132">467</xref></sup> similarly begot Moses at the end of his life. Now the years of Kehat and Amram&#x2019;s lives come to two hundred and seventy. Moses was eighty years old when the Israelites went out of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2133">468</xref></sup> It all thus comes to three hundred and fifty years. We are missing eighty years. It is for this reason that the elders<sup><xref rid="fn2134">469</xref></sup> added, &#x201C;dwelt in Egypt and other countries.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2135">470</xref></sup> The <italic>four hundred years</italic> in <italic>and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years</italic> (Gen. 15:13) is not connected to <italic>and they shall afflict them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2136">471</xref></sup> but rather to <italic>thy seed shall be a stranger</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2137">472</xref></sup> There are many other such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2138">473</xref></sup> We similarly find in our own chapter, <italic>from the first day until the seventh day</italic> (v. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn2139">474</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now we find it stated that God told Abraham at the covenant made &#x201C;between the pieces,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2140">475</xref></sup> <italic>that thy seed shall be a stranger&#x2026;four hundred years</italic>. We know that the number of years that Israel dwelt in Egypt<sup><xref rid="fn2141">476</xref></sup> is contingent upon the &#x201C;end,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2142">477</xref></sup> which was told to Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn2143">478</xref></sup> The author of the <italic>Seder Olam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2144">479</xref></sup> was compelled to say that after Abraham came to the land of Canaan he returned to Haran.<sup><xref rid="fn2145">480</xref></sup> The commentaries were forced to say that the prophecy <italic>I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees</italic> (Gen. 15:7) is not connected to the above-noted chapter<sup><xref rid="fn2146">481</xref></sup> but was said later.<sup><xref rid="fn2147">482</xref></sup> However, there is no need for all of this.<sup><xref rid="fn2148">483</xref></sup> Only the counting of the four hundred years is from the day that Isaac was born.<sup><xref rid="fn2149">484</xref></sup> The additional thirty years start from the day that Abraham left Ur of the Chaldees, the land of his nativity, and came with his father to Haran, as it is written, <italic>and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there</italic> (Gen. 11: 31). Abraham lived in Haran with his father for five years.<sup><xref rid="fn2150">485</xref></sup> He came to the land of Canaan at the age of seventy-five and never returned to Haran.</p>
<p>Now thirty years passed from the time that Abraham left Haran till the day Isaac was born. Abraham was the important one,<sup><xref rid="fn2151">486</xref></sup> and to him was the land of the Canaanite given. The verse <italic>I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees</italic> (Gen. 15:7) is connected to the entire chapter preceding<sup><xref rid="fn2152">487</xref></sup> and following it.<sup><xref rid="fn2153">488</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt</italic> is to be explained: they were strangers there, also their fathers were strangers, as it is written, <italic>Yea, very few, and sojourners in it</italic> (Ps. 105:12); and as Abraham said, I <italic>am a stranger and a sojourner with you</italic> (Gen. 23:4).</p>
<p>FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS. From the day that their father Abraham left the land of his birth.</p>
<p>41. [AND IT CAME TO PASS AT THE END OF FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS.] Scripture states this so that it be known that they did not exit Egypt because of their cries to God until the time<sup><xref rid="fn2154">489</xref></sup> that the Lord had decreed for them had come.<sup><xref rid="fn2155">490</xref></sup></p>
<p>42. IT WAS A NIGHT OF WATCHING UNTO THE LORD. Since Scripture notes, <italic>it was a night of watching unto the Lord</italic>, and concludes by saying, <italic>this same night is a night of watching unto the Lord for all the children of Israel throughout their generations</italic>, the plain meaning of our verse appears to be: since God watched them and did not suffer the destroyer to come into their homes to plague them,<sup><xref rid="fn2156">491</xref></sup> the Lord commanded that this night be <italic>a night of watching</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2157">492</xref></sup><italic>for all the children of Israel throughout their generations</italic> through the eating of the paschal lamb according to its ordinance and the ingesting of unleavened bread and bitter herbs on this night. Others say that watching here has the same meaning as the word watching in <italic>The watchers of the walls</italic> (Cant. 5:7); its meaning is that they should not sleep on this night but should praise God and relate the might that the Lord displayed when they went out of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2158">493</xref></sup> Our sages hinted at the latter meaning when they said, <italic>The time for the reading of the morning shema has arrived</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2159">494</xref></sup></p>
<p>43. AND THE LORD SAID&#x2026;THIS IS THE ORDINANCE OF THE PASSOVER. Since Scripture mentioned <italic>t</italic>hat it was <italic>a night of watching</italic> (v. 42), the reference being to the night of the fifteenth wherein the paschal lamb is to be eaten, the <italic>Torah</italic> completes its explanation of the laws of the Passover<sup><xref rid="fn2160">495</xref></sup> that is to be observed in future generations. Now Scripture does not mention the lintel and the side-post. Neither does it mention that the lamb is to be eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs,<sup><xref rid="fn2161">496</xref></sup> as they were previously mentioned with regard to the Passover observed in Egypt. Its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn2162">497</xref></sup> thus is: you shall eat the Passover offering in the future as you ate it in Egypt. Scripture then added other commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn2163">498</xref></sup> However, the commandments with regard to the lintel and the side-post have nothing to do with the eating of the paschal lamb.<sup><xref rid="fn2164">499</xref></sup> Do you not see that at the beginning of the chapter (i.e., v. 43) it states, <italic>there shall no alien eat thereof</italic> (bo)?<sup><xref rid="fn2165">500</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>bo</italic> (thereof) is, of it.<sup><xref rid="fn2166">501</xref></sup> Its usage in this context is correct in Hebrew<sup><xref rid="fn2167">502</xref></sup> and also in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn2168">503</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-hanotar ba-basar u-va-lechem</italic> (and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread) (Lev. 8:32) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2169">504</xref></sup></p>
<p>44. BUT EVERY MAN&#x2019;S SERVANT&#x2026;WHEN THOU HAST CIRCUMCISED HIM. According to his wish, that he be converted to the law of Israel, if he is of the age when one is obligated to observe the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn2170">505</xref></sup> The law dealing with someone <italic>that is bought for money</italic> and someone born in the house is the same.<sup><xref rid="fn2171">506</xref></sup> However, Scripture deals with that which is more prevalent.<sup><xref rid="fn2172">507</xref></sup></p>
<p>45. A SOJOURNER AND A HIRED SERVANT. Who are Israelites<sup><xref rid="fn2173">508</xref></sup> shall not eat of the paschal lamb if a portion of the lamb has not been assigned to them, as is the law for the entire congregation.</p>
<p>46. IN ONE HOUSE SHALL IT BE EATEN. As the paschal lamb eaten in Egypt was. <italic>Thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house</italic> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn2174">509</xref></sup> However, our sages of blessed memory said that in one house means in one company.<sup><xref rid="fn2175">510</xref></sup> The latter is the correct interpretation.</p>
<p>47. ALL THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL SHALL KEEP IT. All those of the age when one is obligated to observe the commandments are required to prepare a paschal lamb. When I researched the Torah, I found that the twenty-three times where <italic>karet</italic> (excision) is stated<sup><xref rid="fn2176">511</xref></sup> refer to negative precepts. However, I found only two dealing with positive precepts, namely, the paschal lamb<sup><xref rid="fn2177">512</xref></sup> and circumcision.<sup><xref rid="fn2178">513</xref></sup> Perhaps the reason for this is that there is an obligation to &#x201C;remember&#x201D; the Exodus from Egypt, and there is no greater manifestation of &#x201C;remembering&#x201D; than eating the paschal lamb in its proper time. And the beginning of the decalogue states, <italic>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt</italic> (Ex. 20:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2179">514</xref></sup></p>
<p>48. AND WHEN A STRANGER SHALL SOJOURN WITH THEE. The meaning of <italic>with thee</italic> is, with thee in the land of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2180">515</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND WILL KEEP THE PASSOVER.] Its meaning is, and he wants to keep the Passover. Then let him first be circumcised.</p>
<p>[BUT NO UNCIRCUMCISED PERSON SHALL EAT THERE-OF.] The reference is to uncircumcised Israelites<sup><xref rid="fn2181">516</xref></sup> such as those born on the way in the wilderness.<sup><xref rid="fn2182">517</xref></sup></p>
<p>49. ONE LAW. The stranger spoken of in this verse refers to a righteous proselyte, not to a stranger that dwells within the gates.<sup><xref rid="fn2183">518</xref></sup></p>
<p>50. [THUS DID ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] Scripture has already mentioned this above.<sup><xref rid="fn2184">519</xref></sup> Perhaps the reason it is noted again is that it refers to the Passover offering brought in the wilderness of Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn2185">520</xref></sup> at which time the strangers were circumcised.<sup><xref rid="fn2186">521</xref></sup> Do not be surprised that this is written in this place.<sup><xref rid="fn2187">522</xref></sup> Scripture states in the chapter dealing with the coming down of the manna that they should take a jar and put manna therein and place it before the Lord (Ex. 16:33). However, God had not yet commanded the making of the ark of the testimony.<sup><xref rid="fn2188">523</xref></sup> <italic>Have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt</italic> (v. 17) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2189">524</xref></sup></p>
<p>51. AND IT CAME TO PASS THE SELFSAME DAY. I believe that this verse is connected to the verse which follows,<sup><xref rid="fn2190">525</xref></sup> in which God told Moses to sanctify the first-born. The plague of the first-born took place at midnight, and when Israel went out of Egypt the next day God immediately commanded that the first-born of Israel and the first-born of their cattle be sanctified.<sup><xref rid="fn2191">526</xref></sup></p>

Indeed, Filwarg emends Solomon to Samuel. If we do not emend the text then we must interpret I.E. to mean that David established the practice of singing psalms in the house of God and Solomon reaffirmed it when he built the Temple. Cf. Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1672"><sup>7</sup> In other words, David did not institute the temple service on his own accord.</ftnote>

It is interesting to note that I.E. uses the title Rabbi in introducing Judah Ha-Parsi. However, in chapter 1 of his <italic>Iggeret Ha-Shabbat</italic> he quotes the same opinion and there writes, Judah Ha-Parsi says. Similarly, the Karaite Joshua is sometimes quoted with the title Rabbi. As much as one might want to attribute modern notions of civility to I.E., the probability is that the title Rabbi was added by scribes who were not aware of the fact that I.E. was quoting Karaites. The matter bears further investigation. Be the aforementioned as it is, the fact remains that &#x201C;Abraham Ibn Ezra was the only rabbi to quote Karaite sources&#x201D; (L. Roth, <italic>Standard Jewish Encyclopedia</italic>, p. 1106).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1675"><sup>10</sup> The Christians.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1676"><sup>11</sup> The verse continues, <italic>from year to year</italic> (mi-yamim yamimah). Thus the verse teaches that the festivals are to be observed each year in their season. This can only be done if a solar calendar is employed, as seasons are determined by the sun, not the moon. Indeed, in a lunar calendar the months eventually fall in different seasons. For example, the Moslem fast of Ramadan at times falls in the summer, winter, fall, and spring because the Moslems employ a lunar calendar.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1681"><sup>16</sup> &#x201C;The mean rate of the sun&#x2019;s motion in one day&#x2026;is fifty-nine minutes and eight seconds&#x201D;(<italic>M.T., New Moon</italic> 12:1). There are 60 minutes per degree.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1689"><sup>24</sup> The Hebrew term for a month is <italic>chodesh</italic>. It comes from the root <italic>chet, dalet, shin</italic> meaning new. The light of the moon is renewed every 29 and a third days when it is once again in conjunction with the sun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1690"><sup>25</sup> Strictly speaking, <italic>chodesh</italic> applies to the day that the light of the moon is renewed and <italic>yerach</italic> to the entire month. Compare, <italic>yerach yamim</italic> (a full month) in Deut. 21:13 (Krinsky).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1697"><sup>32</sup> For the months of the solar year do not begin or end on the day that the moon starts or completes its cycle around the earth. A lunar month lasts for 29 and a third days and the months of a solar year for 30 or 31 days. Thus the solar months do not reflect reality and are purely arbitrary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1698"><sup>33</sup> That is, the Moslems made a similar arrangement with regard to the year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1699"><sup>34</sup> Hence they were forced to employ lunar months.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1700"><sup>35</sup> Since 12 lunar months almost equal one solar year, the Moslems decided that 12 lunar months make up a year. However, this type of year is purely arbitrary and does not represent reality, as the moon has no year.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1702"><sup>37</sup> There is no Moslem Passover. What I.E. means is the time of the Moslem festivals. Or, if the Moslems celebrated Passover it would recede year by year.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1719"><sup>54</sup> The names of the months are not found in Daniel. It is thus suggested that Daniel be emended to Nehemiah (Weiser). However, it is possible that I.E. did not check his sources and erred.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1720"><sup>55</sup> The allusion is to Esth. 3:7, which reads: &#x201C;In the first month, which is the month of Nisan.&#x201D; This verse presented a problem to I.E. as it implies that Nisan is the real or Hebrew name of the first month, hence his comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1721"><sup>56</sup> In other words, Nisan is not its Hebrew name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1722"><sup>57</sup> I Kings 6:1 literally reads: <italic>And it came to pass&#x2026;in the fourth year, in the month Ziv, which is the second month of Solomon&#x2019;s reign over Israel</italic>. At first glance it appears <italic>which is the second month</italic> is connected to <italic>of Solomon&#x2019;s reign</italic>. We thus have no proof that Ziv is the second month. Hence I.E. says that <italic>of Solomon&#x2019;s reign</italic> refers to <italic>in the fourth year</italic>, and the verse is to be understood as follows: And it came to pass&#x2026;in the fourth year of Solomon&#x2019;s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month. J.P.S. translates accordingly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1723"><sup>58</sup> When the year of a king&#x2019;s reign, is given, months are omitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1724"><sup>59</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. Our texts omits <italic>in the second day</italic>. However, it is in the Biblical text.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1799"><sup>134</sup> In other words they argue that the new year, Rosh Ha-Shanah, should begin in Nisan, the first month. It should be noted that the Torah does not explicitly refer to the first of Tishri as new year&#x2019;s day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1800"><sup>135</sup> In tractate <italic>Rosh Ha-Shanah</italic> 2a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1801"><sup>136</sup> Each one of which serves a distinct purpose. The first of Nisan is the new year for festivals and kings. The first of Tishri is for the reckoning of years, of the year of release (<italic>shimitah</italic>) and the jubilee year. The first of Elul is the new year of the tithe of cattle, and the first of Shebat is for trees (so Beth Shammai, whereas Beth Hillel places it on the 15th of Shebat).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1802"><sup>137</sup> Which shows that the counting of the jubilee year starts in Tishri, not in Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1803"><sup>138</sup> That is, half of the year of release, when one is prohibited from working the ground, would have passed by the time Sukkot arrived. The Torah connects the reading of the Torah with the year of release. If the year of release starts in Tishri then we can understand why the Torah is read in Tishri. However, if the new year starts in Nisan it makes no sense to read the Torah six months later.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1804"><sup>139</sup> The reference is to the festival of Sukkot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1805"><sup>140</sup> We thus see that Sukkot falls in the month at which the year turns, that is, begins. This proves that Tishri is the start of a new year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1806"><sup>141</sup> With reference to the festival of Sukkot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1807"><sup>142</sup> That is, in the month which marks the end of the old and the beginning of a new year. We thus have additional proof that the new year begins in Tishri.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2144"><sup>479</sup> Rabbi Jose bar Chalafta, a second-century Tanna.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2145"><sup>480</sup> In order to reconcile the number 430 given in our verse with the number 400 given in Genesis <italic>Seder Olam</italic> explains that the number 430 refers to the time that passed from the &#x201C;covenant between the pieces&#x201D; (Gen. 15), and the number 400 refers to the time from the birth of Isaac. The accounting is as follows: Abraham was 70 years old when God made the &#x201C;covenant between the pieces&#x201D; with him and told him that his children would be strangers for 400 years (Gen. 15:13). Abraham then went to Haran and spent five years there, as it is written, <italic>And Abraham was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran</italic> (Gen. 12:4). Now Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old (Gen. 21:5). Abraham thus lived in Canaan for 30 years without a son. Exodus, as noted above, starts the count from the &#x201C;covenant between the pieces.&#x201D; Genesis starts the count with the birth of Isaac 30 years later. However, it must be pointed out that the <italic>Seder Olam</italic>&#x2019;s accounting is based on a number of assumptions: a) That the covenant between the pieces occurred when Abraham was 70 years old. Scripture nowhere says so. b) That Abraham returned to Haran. Scripture does not say this either. Hence I.E. did not want to accept the <italic>Seder Olam</italic>&#x2019;s calculations. The question thus remains how to reconcile the number of years mentioned in Exodus with those given in Genesis.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2146"><sup>481</sup> Chapter 15, the &#x201C;covenant between the pieces,&#x201D; as Abraham was yet to leave the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2147"><sup>482</sup> After he returned to Canaan and permanently settled there. This too is not in keeping with the plain meaning of the text and is an argument against the <italic>Seder Olam</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2148"><sup>483</sup> a) To assume in contradiction to Gen. 15:5 that Abraham was 70 at the &#x201C;covenant between the pieces&#x201D;; b) to assume that Abraham returned to Haran; c) to assume that Gen. 15:7 is out of place and was not said at the &#x201C;covenant between the pieces.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2149"><sup>484</sup> As explained by the <italic>Seder Olam</italic>, for Scripture speaks there of <italic>thy seed</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2150"><sup>485</sup> If the 430 years start from the day that Abraham left Ur then Abraham had to be 70 years old when he left that city, for Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old and Israel was liberated 400 years later (see note 480). Now Scripture tells us that Abraham left Haran when he was 75 (Gen. 12:4). Therefore he spent five years in Haran. In his commentary on Genesis, I.E. implies that we cannot ascertain how many years Abraham spent in Haran. See I.E. on Gen. 12:1 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2151"><sup>486</sup> Hence the calculations in our verse begin with him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2152"><sup>487</sup> Literally, above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2153"><sup>488</sup> Literally, below. In other words, the words in the verse were said to Abraham at the &#x201C;covenant of the pieces.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2154"><sup>489</sup> 430 years starting from the day that Abraham left Ur Chasdim.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2155"><sup>490</sup> Their crying reminded God that the period He ordained for their being strangers was over. Had they not cried out unto the Lord, the period of their servitude would not have ended, because according to the arrangement of the stars they were destined to remain in servitude for a much longer time. See I.E. on Ex. 2:23, 24 and 33:21 (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2156"><sup>491</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase of <italic>It was a night of watching unto the Lord</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2157"><sup>492</sup> That is, observance. The Hebrew <italic>shamar</italic> means both watch and observe. Since God watched (<italic>shamar</italic>) Israel on this night, Israel must observe (<italic>li-shemor</italic>) God&#x2019;s special laws this night. Hence <italic>lel shimurim</italic> (a night of watching) means a night of observance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2158"><sup>493</sup> According to this interpretation <italic>lel shimurim</italic> means a watch night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2159"><sup>494</sup> This implies that the sages stayed up all night on the night of the seder. See Passover Haggadah. Also see <italic>Tosefta Pesachim</italic> 10.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2165"><sup>500</sup> Which is a law not previously mentioned. We thus see that the purpose of this chapter was to give additional rules concerning the Passover.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2166"><sup>501</sup> The word <italic>bo</italic> usually means in him or in it.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2170"><sup>505</sup> The age of thirteen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2171"><sup>506</sup> The two are usually coupled together. See Gen. 17:12, 13; Lev. 22:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2172"><sup>507</sup> Hence only someone <italic>that is bought for money</italic> is mentioned here</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2173"><sup>508</sup> Contra the rabbis who interpreted the verse as applying to non-Jews. Cf. <italic>Mekhilta</italic> 15, Rashi, and Nahmanides.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2174"><sup>509</sup> <italic>Carry forth aught</italic> implies that <italic>house</italic> is to be taken literally (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2175"><sup>510</sup> See <italic>Mekhilta</italic> 15, Onkelos, and Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2176"><sup>511</sup> It should be noted that according to the Mishnah in <italic>Kritot</italic> 1:1, the Torah prescribes excision for 36 transgressions. The discrepancy is explained by Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2177"><sup>512</sup> The question thus arises, why is such a harsh penalty inflicted upon one who violates the positive commandment of offering a paschal lamb?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2178"><sup>513</sup> Gen. 17:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2179"><sup>514</sup> Hence remembering the Exodus is a very important commandment, and by not offering the paschal lamb one is in effect denying the Exodus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2180"><sup>515</sup> As a mixed multitude joined Israel.</ftnote>

</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 13</title>
<p>1. AND THE LORD SPOKE. Scripture employs a short form,<sup><xref rid="fn2192">1</xref></sup> for Moses stands in place of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2193">2</xref></sup> However, Yefet says that Moses was commanded to verbally sanctify all first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn2194">3</xref></sup> The aforementioned is the reverse of <italic>then the priest shall defile him</italic> (Lev. 13:8);<sup><xref rid="fn2195">4</xref></sup> the priest, being holy, defiles an individual by declaration.<sup><xref rid="fn2196">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. OPENETH. <italic>Peter</italic> (openeth) means the opening of. <italic>Peter</italic> is similar to <italic>peture</italic> (open) in <italic>and open flowers</italic> (I Kings 6:18). Its meaning is, the son who first opens the womb.<sup><xref rid="fn2197">6</xref></sup> The word <italic>rechem</italic> (womb) is irregular, as according to the rules of Hebrew grammar the letter preceding a guttural is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2198">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND MOSES SAID. <italic>Remember this day</italic> was said by Moses on the fifteenth day.<sup><xref rid="fn2199">8</xref></sup> It means the same as <italic>And this day shall be unto you for a memorial</italic> (Ex. 12:14).</p>
<p>[OUT OF THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE.] This indicates that the Egyptians forced them to work as if they were their slaves.<sup><xref rid="fn2200">9</xref></sup> Elsewhere Scripture reads, <italic>out of the iron furnace</italic> (Deut. 4:20), for the Egyptians overpowered them.<sup><xref rid="fn2201">10</xref></sup> However, the Lord brought them out <italic>by strength of hand</italic> from the mighty.</p>
<p>4. THIS DAY. Moses first mentions, <italic>there shall be no leavened bread eaten</italic>, its meaning being, do in future generations what you did on the day that you left Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2202">11</xref></sup> As you left Egypt at the time when the first ears (<italic>aviv</italic>) are found,<sup><xref rid="fn2203">12</xref></sup> so shall you do yearly in the future in the Land of Israel when the first ears come. The first ears refers to the first ears of barley. The word <italic>aviv</italic> (Abib) means the first that ripens.<sup><xref rid="fn2204">13</xref></sup> <italic>Aviv</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>av</italic> (father), which means first to the one whom one begets, or sage<sup><xref rid="fn2205">14</xref></sup> to the student whom one teaches.<sup><xref rid="fn2206">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, it is written, <italic>for the barley was in the ear</italic> (aviv) (Ex. 9:31).<sup><xref rid="fn2207">16</xref></sup> <italic>Even of the first-fruits</italic> (bikkure) <italic>of wheat harvest</italic> (Ex. 34:22),<sup><xref rid="fn2208">17</xref></sup> which is written with regard to the festival of weeks,<sup><xref rid="fn2209">18</xref></sup> is proof of the above.<sup><xref rid="fn2210">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND IT SHALL BE. Scripture does not list all of the seven Canaanite nations because they have already been mentioned elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="fn2211">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. THE SEVEN DAYS. This is the service.<sup><xref rid="fn2212">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. UNLEAVENED BREAD. Now the stranger that is within the gate was exhorted by God to observe the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn2213">22</xref></sup> as it is only on the condition that he do no work before the Lord on the Sabbath that he may dwell within the gates. Similarly on the Day of Atonement, for it is so written.<sup><xref rid="fn2214">23</xref></sup> The same applies to Passover, as a stranger is not permitted to eat leaven even on his own property. This is the meaning of <italic>in all thy borders</italic>.</p>
<p>8. IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT. Rabbi Merinus says that <italic>ba&#x2019;avur zeh</italic> (it is because of that) should have been written, <italic>zeh ba&#x2019;avur</italic>; i.e., this is because of what the Lord did for me.<sup><xref rid="fn2215">24</xref></sup> He cited what in his opinion are many other such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2216">25</xref></sup> However, I do not think that he was right in even one instance. For how can we invert the words of the living God? The meaning of the verse is just the opposite of what he understands it to be, because we do not eat unleavened bread &#x201C;because of this.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2217">26</xref></sup> Its meaning rather is: it is because of this, i.e., it is because of this service, namely, the eating of unleavened bread and the abstention from leavened bread, which are the first of the precepts that God commanded us, that the Lord did signs for us and brought us out of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2218">27</xref></sup> Its meaning thus is: God took us out of Egypt only to serve Him, as it is written, <italic>when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain</italic> (Ex. 20:12). It is furthermore stated, <italic>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God</italic>:<sup><xref rid="fn2219">28</xref></sup> <italic>I am the Lord your God</italic> (Num. 15:41).</p>
<p>9. AND IT SHALL BE A SIGN UNTO THEE. There are those who oppose our holy patriarchs<sup><xref rid="fn2220">29</xref></sup> and say<sup><xref rid="fn2221">30</xref></sup> that <italic>for a sign&#x2026;and for a memorial</italic> is to be understood in the manner of <italic>For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy head</italic> (Prov. 1:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2222">31</xref></sup> They also say that <italic>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand</italic> (Deut. 5:8) is like <italic>Bind them continually upon thy heart, Tie them upon thy neck</italic> (Prov. 6:21)<sup><xref rid="fn2223">32</xref></sup> and also that <italic>And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house</italic> (Deut. 6:9) is like <italic>Write them upon the table of thy heart</italic> (Prov. 3:3). They furthermore say that <italic>it shall be for a sign&#x2026;and for a memorial</italic> means <italic>for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt</italic> shall drop from your lips.<sup><xref rid="fn2224">33</xref></sup> However, this is incorrect, for at the beginning of the book of Proverbs it is stated, <italic>The Proverbs of Solomon</italic>. Thus whatever Solomon henceforth mentions is by way of parable. However, it is not, heaven forbid, written in the Torah that it is metaphoric. Hence it is to be taken only at face value. We thus will not interpret it except literally. It does not contradict reason if explained according to its plain meaning, like <italic>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart</italic> (Deut. 10:16), which has to be interpreted according to the requirements of reason.<sup><xref rid="fn2225">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>[UPON THY HAND.] Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that the term <italic>yad</italic> (hand) in most of Scripture refers to the left hand,<sup><xref rid="fn2226">35</xref></sup> as in <italic>Yea, My hand</italic> (yadi) <italic>hath laid the foundation of the earth, And My right hand hath spread out the heavens</italic> (Is. 48:13); and <italic>Her hand</italic> (yadah) <italic>she put to the tent-pin, And her right hand to the workmen&#x2019;s hammer</italic> (Jud. 5:26). However, the teachings of tradition are firmly established and do not require any support.<sup><xref rid="fn2227">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. FROM YEAR TO YEAR. <italic>Mi-yamim yamimah</italic> (from year to year) is similar to <italic>yamim tiheyeh ge&#x2019;ullato</italic> (for a full year shall he have the right of redemption (Lev. 25:29). The meaning of <italic>mi-yamim yamimah</italic> is, from year to year. The year begins when the Bet Din announces its commencement.<sup><xref rid="fn2228">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND IT SHALL BE. Moses mentions only the Canaanite, because he was the father of them all.<sup><xref rid="fn2229">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AS HE SWORE UNTO THEE.] Its meaning is similar to <italic>for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give this land</italic> (Gen. 26:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2230">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THAT THOU SHALT SET APART. Thou shalt set it apart unto the Lord so that it does not get mixed up with another.</p>
<p>Now these two precepts<sup><xref rid="fn2231">40</xref></sup> were commanded on the fifteenth day.</p>
<p>COMING OF. <italic>Sheger</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2232">41</xref></sup> (coming of) follows the paradigm of <italic>eretz</italic> (land of) whose vocalization does not change in the construct. However, a number of irregular cases<sup><xref rid="fn2233">42</xref></sup> are found. They are: <italic>shegar</italic> (the increase of)<sup><xref rid="fn2234">43</xref></sup> in <italic>the increase of thy kine</italic> (Deut. 7:13), <italic>chadar</italic> (chamber of)<sup><xref rid="fn2235">44</xref></sup> in <italic>and in the chamber of thy bed</italic> (Ex. 7:28), <italic>havel</italic> (vanity of)<sup><xref rid="fn2236">45</xref></sup> in <italic>Vanity of vanities</italic> (Eccles. 1:1), <italic>hamatekha</italic> (thy venom)<sup><xref rid="fn2237">46</xref></sup> in <italic>That puttest thy venom thereto</italic> (Hab. 2:15), and <italic>delatekha</italic> (thy doors)<sup><xref rid="fn2238">47</xref></sup> in <italic>and shut the doors</italic> (Is. 26:20). I have not found any additional instances.</p>
<p>13. AND EVERY FIRSTLING OF AN ASS. Which is unclean, <italic>thou shalt redeem with a lamb</italic>.</p>
<p>THOU SHALT BREAK ITS NECK. Some say that <italic>va-arafto</italic> (thou shalt break its neck) means thou shalt write the word holy on its neck.<sup><xref rid="fn2239">48</xref></sup> However, I say that anyone who says this is himself a stiff-necked ass. For behold it is written, <italic>He will break down</italic> (ya&#x2019;arof) <italic>their altars</italic> (Hos. 10:2),<sup><xref rid="fn2240">49</xref></sup> and <italic>ve-arefu sham et ha-eglah ba-nachal</italic> (and shall break the heifer&#x2019;s neck there in the valley) (Deut. 21:4), in which the meaning of <italic>ve-arefu</italic> is, as explained by the transmitters of the law, to cut off the neck.<sup><xref rid="fn2241">50</xref></sup> All firstlings that are not brought up on the altar or are not redeemed are required to be killed, as all the first-born of Egypt both man and beast perished. God did not save them<sup><xref rid="fn2242">51</xref></sup> from the decree which he had issued on the first-born of the Egyptians except that they should be prepared for His service.</p>
<p>The Israelites had no unclean animals except for asses. Therefore no other<sup><xref rid="fn2243">52</xref></sup> first-born<sup><xref rid="fn2244">53</xref></sup> is to be redeemed.</p>
<p>14. AND IT SHALL BE. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi of blessed memory says that the word <italic>machar</italic> (in time to come)<sup><xref rid="fn2245">54</xref></sup> is missing an <italic>alef</italic>, its meaning being that which comes after today.<sup><xref rid="fn2246">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND IT CAME TO PASS. Moses begins by saying, <italic>By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt</italic> (v. 14) and backtracks and explains that what the strength of hand refers to is the plague of the first-born. It was because of this plague, and not because of the first plagues, that Israel went out of Egypt. The poet similarly says, <italic>To Him that smote Egypt in their first-born, For His mercy endureth for ever</italic> (Ps. 136:10).<sup><xref rid="fn2247">56</xref></sup> Moses wrote elliptically. When Moses said, <italic>that the Lord slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beasts</italic>, it was known<sup><xref rid="fn2248">57</xref></sup> that God saved our first-born and the first-born of our cattle. It is to the latter,<sup><xref rid="fn2249">58</xref></sup> not to the slaying of the first-born, that <italic>therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb</italic> is connected.</p>
<p>ALL THAT OPENETH THE WOMB, BEING MALES. From a kind fit to be sacrificed to the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn2250">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND IT SHALL BE FOR A SIGN. Scripture mentions, <italic>And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand</italic> with regard to two commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn2251">60</xref></sup> That which the sages of blessed memory transmitted, namely, that the chapters<sup><xref rid="fn2252">61</xref></sup> are to be written,<sup><xref rid="fn2253">62</xref></sup> is true.</p>
<p>AND FOR FRONTLETS. <italic>Totafot</italic> (frontlets) means a memorial.<sup><xref rid="fn2254">63</xref></sup> Others say<sup><xref rid="fn2255">64</xref></sup> that the <italic>tet</italic> of <italic>totafot</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2256">65</xref></sup> is doubled,<sup><xref rid="fn2257">66</xref></sup> its meaning being to speak. They say that it comes from the same root as <italic>ve-hettef</italic> (and preach) in <italic>and preach toward the south</italic> (Ezek. 21:2). However, in my opinion this is far-fetched.<sup><xref rid="fn2258">67</xref></sup></p>

<p>17. AND IT CAME TO PASS WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET THE PEOPLE GO. The <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>ve-lo nacham</italic> (led them not) is like an unaspirated <italic>fa</italic> in the Arabic tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn2259">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is known that the distance between Egypt and Jerusalem by way of the land of the Philistines is not very great. It is about a ten-day journey by straight road. If this was not so, how did the tribes<sup><xref rid="fn2260">69</xref></sup> come as far as Egypt upon their asses?<sup><xref rid="fn2261">70</xref></sup> If the distance was very great how much would have been necessary for them and their asses to eat?<sup><xref rid="fn2262">71</xref></sup> Furthermore, upon returning they brought back food for their households.<sup><xref rid="fn2263">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>ALTHOUGH THAT WAS NEAR. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that <italic>ki karov hu</italic> means <italic>although that was near</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2264">73</xref></sup> In my opinion, <italic>ki am keshe oref hu</italic> (for it is a stiff-necked people) (Ex. 34:9); <italic>refa&#x2019;ah nafshi ki chatati lakh</italic> (Heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee) (Ps. 41:5); and <italic>ki rekhev barzel lo</italic> (though they have chariots of iron) (Josh. 17:18) are similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2265">74</xref></sup> However, I see no need for this interpretation,<sup><xref rid="fn2266">75</xref></sup> for its meaning is: the reason God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines was that it was close.<sup><xref rid="fn2267">76</xref></sup> God thus led them via a distant way so that they would not witness any war and say, <italic>Let us make a captain, and let us return to Egypt</italic> (Num. 14:4).</p>
<p>[LEST PERADVENTURE.] We know for certain that the Lord knows the future.<sup><xref rid="fn2268">77</xref></sup> God knew that the people would repent if He led them by the way of the land of the Philistines. Scripture reads, <italic>Lest peradventure the people repent</italic> because the Torah employed human terminology so that those who study<sup><xref rid="fn2269">78</xref></sup> will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn2270">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. LED THE PEOPLE ABOUT. <italic>Va-yassev</italic> (led about)<sup><xref rid="fn2271">80</xref></sup> is a verb<sup><xref rid="fn2272">81</xref></sup> that comes from a double root. Its stem is <italic>samekh, bet, bet. Va-yassev</italic> also has an alternative vocalization.<sup><xref rid="fn2273">82</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>va-yasekh</italic> (shut up) in <italic>Or who shut up</italic> (Job 38:8)<sup><xref rid="fn2274">83</xref></sup> and <italic>va-yagel</italic> (and rolled) in <italic>and rolled the stone</italic> (Gen. 29:10).<sup><xref rid="fn2275">84</xref></sup> Pay no heed to those who say that the root of <italic>va- yassev</italic> is <italic>nun, samekh, bet</italic>.</p>
<p>[THE WILDERNESS.] The word <italic>ha-midbar</italic> (the wilderness) is to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn2276">85</xref></sup> The clause is to be understood as if written, by the way of the wilderness, wilderness of the Red Sea. Similarly, <italic>ha-aron ha-bebrit</italic> (the ark of the covenant) (Josh. 3:14) is to be understood as if written, the ark, ark of the covenant,<sup><xref rid="fn2277">86</xref></sup> and, <italic>ve-etz ha-da&#x2019;at tov va-ra</italic> (the tree of the knowledge of good and evil) (Gen. 2:9) as if written, and the tree of the knowledge, knowledge of good and evil.<sup><xref rid="fn2278">87</xref></sup> Likewise the terms <italic>ha-sefer ha-miknah</italic> (the deed of the purchase)<sup><xref rid="fn2279">88</xref></sup> (Jer. 32:12) and <italic>ha-yayin ha-chemah</italic> (the wine of fury) (Jer. 25:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2280">89</xref></sup> There are many other similar instances.</p>
<p>RED SEA. <italic>Suf</italic> (Red) is the name of a place. Others say that <italic>suf</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>sof</italic> (the end)<sup><xref rid="fn2281">90</xref></sup> in <italic>The end of the matter</italic> (Eccles. 12:13). It is so called because it lies at the end of the world. The reference is to the Atlantic, which I have already mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn2282">91</xref></sup> However, this is a major blunder, because the <italic>yam suf</italic> (Red Sea) lies in the east, opposite Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2283">92</xref></sup> The Spanish Sea<sup><xref rid="fn2284">93</xref></sup> is larger than it.<sup><xref rid="fn2285">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>ARMED. Some say that <italic>chamushim</italic> (armed) means full of wealth, possessing all that they need. Now Scripture states, <italic>neither had they prepared for themselves any victual</italic> (Ex. 12:39).<sup><xref rid="fn2286">95</xref></sup> Furthermore, what reason is there to mention this now?<sup><xref rid="fn2287">96</xref></sup> The only meaning of <italic>chamushim</italic> is, girded with weapons for war. Compare, <italic>chalutzim ta&#x2019;avoru</italic> (ye shall pass over armed) (Deut. 3:18), the meaning of which is: ye shall pass over with girded loins.<sup><xref rid="fn2288">97</xref></sup> The fact that Scripture in one place reads, <italic>ve-attem ta&#x2019;averu chamushim</italic> (but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed) (Josh. 1:14) and in another place refers to the Israelites as <italic>chalutzim</italic> (Deut. 3:18) is true witness to the aforementioned.<sup><xref rid="fn2289">98</xref></sup> What reason was there for them to carry food before their brethren?<sup><xref rid="fn2290">99</xref></sup> The reason Scripture at this point notes <italic>that the children of Israel went up armed</italic> is that it is previously stated, <italic>Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt</italic> (v. 17).<sup><xref rid="fn2291">100</xref></sup> For<sup><xref rid="fn2292">101</xref></sup> the Israelites went out <italic>with a high hand</italic> (Ex. 14:8), with weapons of war and not like fleeing slaves.</p>
<p>19. AND MOSES TOOK THE BONES OF JOSEPH. Scripture mentions above that <italic>the children of Israel</italic> who were alive in that generation <italic>went up out of the land of Egypt</italic>. Scripture now notes that the children of Israel also brought up with them the most honored one of them, the one through whom they came down to Egypt. The latter had made them swear before his death that they would tell their children, and their children would instruct their children about this.<sup><xref rid="fn2293">102</xref></sup> Now Moses busied himself with fulfilling the oath so that no guilt would fall upon Israel. For we see that the princes of Israel swore an oath to the Gibeonites.<sup><xref rid="fn2294">103</xref></sup> Now they only took this oath on condition that the Gibeonites came from a distant place as they claimed.<sup><xref rid="fn2295">104</xref></sup> After it was found that the Gibeonites came from close by<sup><xref rid="fn2296">105</xref></sup> it was fitting that they not keep their oath so that they and all Israel not violate the injunction, <italic>thou shalt save alive nothing</italic> (Deut. 20:16). However, they kept their oath out of regard for God&#x2019;s glory so that they not desecrate it.<sup><xref rid="fn2297">106</xref></sup> Many years later God punished the children of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn2298">107</xref></sup> because Saul permitted the Gibeonites who were in Nob, the city of the priests, to be put to death.<sup><xref rid="fn2299">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE BONES OF JOSEPH.] Scripture mentions <italic>the bones of</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2300">109</xref></sup> for all of the flesh and skin breeds worms and putrefies, and after a few years only the bones remain.<sup><xref rid="fn2301">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND THEY TOOK THEIR JOURNEY&#x2026;ETHAM. Etham is, as I will explain,<sup><xref rid="fn2302">111</xref></sup> the wilderness of Shur.</p>
<p>21. AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY. We know that the Lord <italic>inhabiteth eternity and His name is Holy</italic> (Is. 57:15), and that <italic>He is enthroned of old. Selah</italic> (Ps. 55:20).<sup><xref rid="fn2303">112</xref></sup> Scripture speaks in the language of men. It reads so because God&#x2019;s power went with Israel, as in <italic>That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses</italic> (Is. 63:12).</p>
<p>[IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD.] Scripture reads, <italic>in a pillar of cloud</italic> because it was not shaped like other clouds but was in the form of a pillar stretching from the sky upon the earth. A pillar is called an <italic>ammud</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2304">113</xref></sup> in Hebrew because the base (<italic>ma&#x2019;amad</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2305">114</xref></sup> of the house is on it.<sup><xref rid="fn2306">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT THEY MIGHT GO BY DAY AND BY NIGHT.] Scripture reads, <italic>that they might go by day and by night</italic> because the camp was large and they could only journey a short distance.<sup><xref rid="fn2307">116</xref></sup> They therefore journeyed part of the day<sup><xref rid="fn2308">117</xref></sup> and also part of the night.<sup><xref rid="fn2309">118</xref></sup> These two pillars were, as I shall explain,<sup><xref rid="fn2310">119</xref></sup> before the Israelites until they came to the sea.</p>
<p>22. DEPARTED NOT. <italic>Yamish</italic> (departed) is a transitive verb.<sup><xref rid="fn2311">120</xref></sup> For God mentioned above<sup><xref rid="fn2312">121</xref></sup> did not cause the pillars to depart from before the people.</p>
<p>[BY DAY.] The word <italic>yomam</italic> (by day) is not found employed in Scripture except for the time when the sun shines upon the earth. The word <italic>yom</italic> (day) found in the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings refers also to nighttime, for it is written, <italic>on the day</italic> (yom) <italic>that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt</italic> (Num. 8:17). Now the slaying of the first-born took place at night.<sup><xref rid="fn2313">122</xref></sup> It is also written, <italic>this day</italic> (ha-yom) <italic>is a day</italic> (yom) <italic>of good tidings</italic> (II Kings 7:9). Now it was then night, for we read there, <italic>if we tarry till the morning light</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). Scripture also reads, <italic>The day</italic> (yom) <italic>I cry in the night before Thee</italic> (Ps. 88:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2314">123</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2192"><sup>1</sup> Scripture should have followed up our verse with: speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them as in Num. 6:1,2. As things stand, it is nowhere stated in our chapter that Moses told or was commanded to relate the contents of verse 1 to the Israelites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2193"><sup>2</sup> Hence <italic>And the Lord spoke unto Moses</italic> is the same as saying, the Lord spoke unto Israel; i.e., the contents of this chapter pertained to Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2194"><sup>3</sup> According to Yefet this command was only for Moses. Moses personally was to declare all first-born holy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2195"><sup>4</sup> Translated literally. J.P.S. renders, <italic>then the priest shall pronounce him unclean</italic>. Both Moses and the priests perform their actions verbally. What I.E. means by the term &#x201C;reverse&#x201D; is that one makes someone unclean while the other makes one holy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2196"><sup>5</sup> And not in any other way. The verse can be taken to mean that the priest shall place an unclean object upon the subject in order to make him unclean, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2197"><sup>6</sup> <italic>Peter kol rechem</italic> literally means the opening of the womb, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2198"><sup>7</sup> Rather than a <italic>segol</italic> in penultimately accented nouns. Compare, <italic>nachal</italic> (river), <italic>lahav</italic> (flame), and <italic>na&#x2019;ar</italic> (youth) (Weiser). Hence our word should have been vocalized <italic>racham</italic> rather than <italic>rechem</italic>. Cf. Jud. 5:30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2199"><sup>8</sup> Of Nisan, the day that they actually left Egypt. The Hebrew literally reads: on the day (<italic>ba-yom</italic>) of the 15th day (<italic>yom</italic>) he said remember. Filwarg correctly points out that the second <italic>yom</italic> is a scribal error and should be deleted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2200"><sup>9</sup> Hence Scripture speaks of the place/house of bondage. However, the Israelites were not true slaves. They were a separate nation. They lived in their own houses, not in the homes of their masters; they had a family life and a culture. I.E. apparently comments thus so that people would not think of the ancient Israelites in the same way that they thought of contemporary slaves, i.e., as mean people. Cf. Aristotle&#x2019;s <italic>Politics</italic>, 1:5, &#x201C;From the hour of their birth, some are marked out for subjection, others for rule&#x2026;Clearly there are some who are by nature free, others are by nature slaves, and for the latter their condition of servitude is both advantageous and just.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2201"><sup>10</sup> And forced them to work as if they were the slaves, of the Egyptians.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2202"><sup>11</sup> Eat no leaven on that day.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2204"><sup>13</sup> The barley ripens first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2205"><sup>14</sup> A sage is called an <italic>av</italic>. Cf. Jud. 17:10, <italic>Dwell with me, and be unto me a father</italic> (av) <italic>and a priest</italic>; and <italic>Pirke Avot</italic> (Ethics of the Fathers/Sages).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2206"><sup>15</sup> In this case <italic>av</italic> means first in wisdom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2207"><sup>16</sup> Which shows that <italic>aviv</italic> refers to ears of barley.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2208"><sup>17</sup> The Torah refers to the first ears of the wheat harvest as <italic>bikkurim</italic>, not <italic>avivim</italic>, for <italic>aviv</italic> refers to the first barley ears, which ripen about two months before the wheat does.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2209"><sup>18</sup> Which falls seven weeks after Passover.</ftnote>

Rabbi Merinus could find no sense in this. <italic>Prima facie</italic>, &#x201C;because of this&#x201D; refers to the eating of <italic>matzah</italic>. What meaning is there in: because of the eating of the <italic>matzah</italic>, the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt? He thus interprets our verse to mean: It is because of that (<italic>zeh ba&#x2019;avur</italic>) which the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt that I eat <italic>matzah</italic> and abstain from leaven.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2216"><sup>25</sup> Where the word order has to be inverted. See <italic>Sefer Ha-Rikmah</italic>, chap. 28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2217"><sup>26</sup> In other words, <italic>ba&#x2019;avur zeh</italic> is not to be interpreted as a reason for the eating of the matzah and abstaining from leaven.</ftnote>

Rabbi Moses interprets thus, for <italic>prima facie</italic>, the word, &#x201C;because&#x201D; is out of place here, as God should have led them by the way of the Philistines <span class="underline">because</span> it was close.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2265"><sup>74</sup> The word <italic>ki</italic> in these verses is to be translated as although. Hence Ex. 34:9 is to be translated, <italic>although it is a stiff-necked people</italic>; and Ps. 41:5, <italic>Heal my soul; although I have sinned against Thee</italic>.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 14</title>
<p>1. AND THE LORD SPOKE. It is truly not proper for an intelligent person to scrutinize God&#x2019;s actions and ask, why did the Lord act thus?<sup><xref rid="fn2315">1</xref></sup> For all of God&#x2019;s actions are done wisely. Man&#x2019;s wisdom is as nothing before God.<sup><xref rid="fn2316">2</xref></sup> I mention this because you will read in this Torah portion that God<sup><xref rid="fn2317">3</xref></sup> guilefully commanded the Israelites to turn back<sup><xref rid="fn2318">4</xref></sup> so that Pharaoh would go out and pursue them, and drown in the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2319">5</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s thoughts are very deep.<sup><xref rid="fn2320">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. PI-HAHIROTH. <italic>Pi-hahiroth</italic> is elsewhere called <italic>Pene-hahiroth</italic> (Num. 33:8). It is so called<sup><xref rid="fn2321">7</xref></sup> because the mouth (<italic>peh</italic>) is on the face (<italic>panim</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2322">8</xref></sup> It is the name of a place.</p>
<p>BEFORE BAAL-ZEPHON. Some say that the Egyptian magicians made bronze images which drew power from the stars, and that Baal-zephon was a statue that no slave fleeing Egypt was able to pass by.<sup><xref rid="fn2323">9</xref></sup> It is because of this that Scripture reads, <italic>that the people were fled</italic> (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn2324">10</xref></sup> However, in my opinion because Moses said to Pharaoh, <italic>We will go three days&#x2019; journey into the wilderness</italic> (Ex. 8:23), it appeared to Pharaoh from these words that Moses knew the road that they would take to the place where they intended to sacrifice. Thus when Pharaoh heard that the Israelites started to go by way of the wilderness,<sup><xref rid="fn2325">11</xref></sup> and when they had traveled some distance<sup><xref rid="fn2326">12</xref></sup> backtracked to go in another way, Pharaoh surmised that everything that Moses had told him was said in guile, that he did not intend to sacrifice but to flee. For one who flees becomes confused on the way and does not know which road to take.</p>
<p>OVER AGAINST IT. The word <italic>nikhcho</italic> (over against it) is vocalized with a <italic>chirik</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2327">13</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>niflo</italic> (was fallen)<sup><xref rid="fn2328">14</xref></sup> in <italic>after that he was fallen</italic> (II Sam. 1:10). There are many other such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2329">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND PHARAOH WILL SAY OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. This is similar to <italic>say of me</italic> (Gen. 20:13).<sup><xref rid="fn2330">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>ENTANGLED. <italic>Nevukhim</italic> (entangled) is vocalized with a <italic>shuruk</italic> in place of a <italic>cholam</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2331">17</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>ta&#x2019;avuri</italic> (pass)<sup><xref rid="fn2332">18</xref></sup> in <italic>neither pass from hence</italic> (Ruth 2:8), for <italic>nevukhim</italic> is a <italic>nifal</italic> as the word <italic>nekhonim</italic> (ready) (Ex. 19:11) is.<sup><xref rid="fn2333">19</xref></sup> Now <italic>navokhu</italic> (perplexed) (Joel 1:18) and also <italic>navokhah</italic> (perplexed) in <italic>but the city of Shushan was perplexed</italic> (Est. 3:15) are like <italic>nakhonah</italic> (established)<sup><xref rid="fn2334">20</xref></sup> in <italic>And the kingdom was established</italic> (I Kings 2:46). Its meaning is, they are like a person who cannot find anyone to advise him and does not know what to do.<sup><xref rid="fn2335">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>nun</italic> in <italic>nivkhe</italic> (depths of) in <italic>the depths of the sea</italic> (Job 38:16)<sup><xref rid="fn2336">22</xref></sup> is a root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn2337">23</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>nivkhe yam</italic> (the springs of the sea) is the depths of the sea. <italic>Nivkhe</italic> has no place here.<sup><xref rid="fn2338">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE WILDERNESS HATH SHUT THEM IN. The ways of the wilderness are closed to them, and like fugitives they do not know where to go.</p>
<p>4. AND I WILL HARDEN PHARAOH&#x2019;S HEART. As if he forgot the plagues<sup><xref rid="fn2339">25</xref></sup> with which the Egyptians were smitten because of Israel.</p>
<p>AND I WILL GET ME HONOR UPON PHARAOH. My glory shall be manifest in the world when I drown Pharaoh and his army.<sup><xref rid="fn2340">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE EGYPTIANS SHALL KNOW. The remnants<sup><xref rid="fn2341">27</xref></sup> and those who drowned prior to their death <italic>shall know that I am the Lord</italic>.</p>
<p>AND THEY DID SO. Scripture&#x2019;s short way of saying that they turned backwards.<sup><xref rid="fn2342">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND IT WAS TOLD THE KING OF EGYPT. That they are not going for any purpose but to flee.</p>
<p>6. AND HE MADE READY HIS CHARIOT. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn2343">29</xref></sup> It is like <italic>So Solomon built the house</italic> (I Kings 14:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2344">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND HE TOOK SIX HUNDRED CHOSEN CHARIOTS. The chosen chariots of all the chariots that he had.<sup><xref rid="fn2345">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND CAPTAINS. Note that the king is like the number one. Therefore the one who is next to him in rank is called the <italic>mishneh</italic> (the second), which is derived from the same root as <italic>shenayim</italic> (two). The third in rank is called the <italic>shelishi</italic>. <sup><xref rid="fn2346">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. WITH A HIGH HAND. They had all the weapons of war and so did not go out like fugitives.</p>
<p>9. AND THE EGYPTIANS PURSUED AFTER THEM. This is in keeping with linguistical style.<sup><xref rid="fn2347">33</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>and the people saw</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2348">34</xref></sup> <italic>and they trembled and stood far off</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2349">35</xref></sup> (Ex. 20:15), the meaning of which is, when they saw this,<sup><xref rid="fn2350">36</xref></sup> they trembled and stood far off. The meaning of <italic>and the Egyptians pursued after them</italic> thus is: when the Egyptians pursued them,<sup><xref rid="fn2351">37</xref></sup> they overtook them as they were encamping by the sea.</p>
<p>[ALL THE HORSES.] Scripture notes this<sup><xref rid="fn2352">38</xref></sup> to inform us that they did not come upon them scattered.<sup><xref rid="fn2353">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HIS HORSEMEN. <italic>Parashav</italic> means his horsemen.</p>
<p>AND HIS ARMY. <italic>Chelo</italic> (his army) means his foot soldiers.</p>
<p>10. AND WHEN PHARAOH DREW NEAR. When Pharaoh caused his camp to draw near.<sup><xref rid="fn2354">40</xref></sup> The verb <italic>hikriv</italic> (drew near) is always transitive in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn2355">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND THEY SAID. We find that the holy tongue employs two words with one meaning back to back when one would suffice. Now the phrase <italic>ha-mibbeli en kevarim</italic> (because there were no graves)<sup><xref rid="fn2356">42</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>ha-rak akh be-mosheh</italic> (only with Moses?) (Num. 12:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2357">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO BRING US FORTH. <italic>Le-hotzi&#x2019;anu</italic> (to bring us forth) is vocalized with a long <italic>kamatz</italic> in place of a <italic><span class="underline">tzere</span></italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2358">44</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>ro&#x2019;ani</italic> (seeth me)<sup><xref rid="fn2359">45</xref></sup> in <italic>Thou hast said</italic>:<sup><xref rid="fn2360">46</xref></sup> <italic>None seeth me</italic> (Is. 47:10).</p>
<p>12. IS THIS NOT THE WORD. This is not stated.<sup><xref rid="fn2361">47</xref></sup> However, we know that this was the case, for how could they say to his face something that was not true? This remark was included in <italic>but they hearkened not unto Moses</italic> (Ex. 6:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2362">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. STAND STILL, AND SEE THE SALVATION OF THE LORD. For you will not wage war but you shall see the salvation which the Lord will work for you this day.</p>
<p>One may ask: How is it that a large camp comprising six hundred thousand armed men were afraid of those who pursued them? Why did they not stand and fight for their own and their children&#x2019;s lives? The answer is: The Egyptians were masters over Israel. The generation that left Egypt were trained from their youth to bear the yoke of the Egyptians. They were of humble spirit. How then could they now wage war against their masters? The Israelites were lazy and not learned in war. Can you not see that were it not for the prayers of Moses, the Amalekites, who came<sup><xref rid="fn2363">49</xref></sup> with a small number of men, would have defeated Israel.</p>
<p>God alone, <italic>Who doeth great things</italic> (Job 5:9); <italic>And by Him actions are weighed</italic> (I Sam. 2:3), so arranged events that all Israelite males<sup><xref rid="fn2364">50</xref></sup> who left Egypt died out,<sup><xref rid="fn2365">51</xref></sup> for they had no spirit to fight the Canaanites; and a new generation with a noble spirit, who had never tasted exile, arose after the generation of the wilderness.<sup><xref rid="fn2366">52</xref></sup> I have noted the aforementioned in the account of Moses recorded in the Torah portion <italic>Ve-Eleh Shemot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2367">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. THE LORD WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. <italic>Lakhem</italic> means for you.<sup><xref rid="fn2368">54</xref></sup> Similarly, whenever the word war (<italic>milchamah</italic>) is followed by a <italic>lamed</italic> it indicates aid. Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen therefore explains <italic>li</italic> (me) in <italic>For there are many that fight</italic> (lochamim) <italic>me</italic> (li) <italic>on high</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2369">55</xref></sup> (Ps. 56:3) to mean for me.<sup><xref rid="fn2370">56</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>on high</italic> is, a war on high, as is the case with all that sit.<sup><xref rid="fn2371">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND YE SHALL HOLD YOUR PEACE. In contrast to <italic>and the children of Israel cried out</italic> (v. 10).</p>
<p>15. WHEREFORE CRIEST THOU UNTO ME. Some say that Moses was crying out unto the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn2372">58</xref></sup> However, this is incorrect, for God had already told Moses, <italic>and I will get Me honor upon Pharaoh</italic> (v. 4).<sup><xref rid="fn2373">59</xref></sup> On the contrary, this was told to Moses who stood in Israel&#x2019;s stead<sup><xref rid="fn2374">60</xref></sup> because the children of Israel cried out to the Lord.</p>
<p>THAT THEY GO FORWARD. Little by little until they reach the edge of the sea.</p>
<p>16. AND LIFT THOU UP. God told Moses to lift up his rod and divide the sea before the children of Israel went forward. The Lord did not tell Moses to strike the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2375">61</xref></sup> He told him to stretch out his hand toward the sea<sup><xref rid="fn2376">62</xref></sup> in the manner<sup><xref rid="fn2377">63</xref></sup> of <italic>And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn2378">64</xref></sup> (Ex. 9:23). We know that the rod did not divide the sea but that from the moment that Moses stretched his hand toward the sea God caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind and the waters then<sup><xref rid="fn2379">65</xref></sup> split. For it is so written.<sup><xref rid="fn2380">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND I. We know that the Red Sea is not situated between Egypt and the Land of Israel. There was no reason for them to enter the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2381">67</xref></sup> However, God commanded them to do so, so that the Egyptians would enter behind them and drown. The children of Israel, as I will explain,<sup><xref rid="fn2382">68</xref></sup> entered the sea from the wilderness of Etham and exited the sea to the wilderness of Etham.</p>
<p>18. AND THE EGYPTIANS SHALL KNOW. Those that remained.<sup><xref rid="fn2383">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHEN I HAVE GOTTEN ME HONOR UPON PHARAOH. Who will drown along with his chariots and horsemen.</p>
<p>19. AND THE ANGEL OF GOD. This took place before <italic>speak unto the children of Israel, that they should go forward</italic> (v. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn2384">70</xref></sup> It&#x2019;s meaning thus is, and the angel of God had already removed.<sup><xref rid="fn2385">71</xref></sup> I have already showed you many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2386">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now because these three verses<sup><xref rid="fn2387">73</xref></sup> are connected to each other and each one has seventy-two letters we find in them, as stated in the books,<sup><xref rid="fn2388">74</xref></sup> the sign of the secret of God&#x2019;s explicit name. However, in my opinion it is so written<sup><xref rid="fn2389">75</xref></sup> because, as I will explain in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2390">76</xref></sup> the numerical value of God&#x2019;s glorious name comes to seventy-two.</p>
<p>The <italic>Book of Raziel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2391">77</xref></sup> states that one who wants to query the heavenly powers in a dream should read the verse, <italic>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year</italic>, etc. (Ezek. 1:1), for it contains seventy-two letters.<sup><xref rid="fn2392">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE ANGEL OF GOD. The reference is to the great prince<sup><xref rid="fn2393">79</xref></sup> who goes in the cloud, concerning whom it is written, <italic>And the Lord went before them by day</italic> (Ex. 13:21). When this angel, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them, the pillar of cloud moved with him. Let the one who identifies the angel of God with the cloud show us where we find the pillar of cloud called the angel of God. Furthermore, if the angel and the pillar are one and the same, why is <italic>and the pillar of cloud removed from before them</italic> repeated? If he should answer that Scripture repeats the same idea in different words,<sup><xref rid="fn2394">80</xref></sup> then we respond that it is not the manner of Scripture to repeat itself except in prophecy<sup><xref rid="fn2395">81</xref></sup> or reproof.<sup><xref rid="fn2396">82</xref></sup> Moreover, it is unfit to repeat oneself when reporting how something happened.<sup><xref rid="fn2397">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND IT CAME. And the angel came.<sup><xref rid="fn2398">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THERE WAS THE CLOUD AND THE DARKNESS HERE. Between the camps.</p>
<p>AND IT LIT UP THE NIGHT.<sup><xref rid="fn2399">85</xref></sup> As was the manner on all the nights, so that Israel could cross the sea. They crossed it at night.</p>
<p>Rabbi Merinus says that the meaning of <italic>va-ya&#x2019;er</italic> (he lit up) is, he darkened. <italic>And the night shall be light about me</italic> (Ps. 139: 11)<sup><xref rid="fn2400">86</xref></sup> is similar. Furthermore, we find, <italic>On the light of the fourteenth day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2401">87</xref></sup> in rabbinic literature. However, the one who interprets thus turns darkness into light and light into darkness, for it is impossible in any language for a word to mean both a thing and its opposite unless it is euphemistically used, as in <italic>Naboth did bless God and the king</italic> (I Kings 21:13).<sup><xref rid="fn2402">88</xref></sup> The word light in <italic>shall be light about me</italic> refers to the light itself, as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2403">89</xref></sup> Similarly, the sages said<sup><xref rid="fn2404">90</xref></sup> that <italic>On the light of the fourteenth</italic> is a refined language,<sup><xref rid="fn2405">91</xref></sup> which is similar to a euphemism. Furthermore, what reason was there for Scripture to say, <italic>and he darkened the night</italic>? It is dark every night. The only meaning of <italic>va-ya&#x2019;er et ha-laylah</italic> is that he<sup><xref rid="fn2406">92</xref></sup> lit up the night<sup><xref rid="fn2407">93</xref></sup> as he did from the day that Israel went out of Egypt, for the pillar of fire was seen every night. Now if Israel had no light how did they cross the sea?<sup><xref rid="fn2408">94</xref></sup> For behold, by the time Pharaoh came into the sea and the Lord looked forth upon him in the morning watch, most of the Israelites had already crossed.<sup><xref rid="fn2409">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND&#x2026;ALL THE NIGHT. Even while Israel was crossing, the wind did not cease.</p>
<p>22. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WENT INTO THE MIDST OF THE SEA. Do not think that because Scripture reads, <italic>in the midst</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2410">96</xref></sup> <italic>of the sea</italic> that the Israelites reached the middle of the Red Sea. On the contrary, even if they entered the sea for even half of a Persian mile one may say that they came in the midst of the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2411">97</xref></sup> It is like <italic>And the mixed multitude that was in the midst of them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2412">98</xref></sup> (Num. 11:4), for the mixed multitude was not in the middle of the camp. The meaning of <italic>the midst of the sea</italic> is, the place where there was water at the beginning of the night.<sup><xref rid="fn2413">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE WATERS WERE A WALL UNTO THEM. The waters froze.<sup><xref rid="fn2414">100</xref></sup> It is also written, <italic>The floods stood upright as a heap</italic> (Ex. 15:8).<sup><xref rid="fn2415">101</xref></sup> After most of Israel crossed, the waters which formed a wall for them melted. This is the meaning of <italic>that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians</italic> (v. 26). These waters<sup><xref rid="fn2416">102</xref></sup> separated between the Egyptians and the dry land.<sup><xref rid="fn2417">103</xref></sup> It therefore states, <italic>and the Egyptians fled against it</italic> (v. 27), as the Egyptians thought that they would go out onto dry land.<sup><xref rid="fn2418">104</xref></sup> But the walls of water melted and separated them and dry land. There is no doubt that those who pursued Israel saw the light by which Israel crossed.<sup><xref rid="fn2419">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MORNING WATCH. The <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>ashmoret</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2420">106</xref></sup> (watch) is a superfluous letter.<sup><xref rid="fn2421">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT THE LORD LOOKED FORTH. The reference is to the angel of the Lord mentioned earlier.<sup><xref rid="fn2422">108</xref></sup> The same is the case with Gideon,<sup><xref rid="fn2423">109</xref></sup> where the messenger is called by the name of the sender. Since the sender commands his agent to commit an act, it is as if the sender himself had executed it.</p>
<p>THROUGH THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND OF CLOUD. Between these two pillars.<sup><xref rid="fn2424">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND DISCOMFITED. Possibly because of this the poet says, <italic>The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind</italic> (Ps. 77:19).<sup><xref rid="fn2425">111</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>And He shot forth lightnings, and discomfited them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2426">112</xref></sup> (Ps. 18:15). Elsewhere it is written, <italic>And He sent&#x2026;Lightning, and discomfited them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2427">113</xref></sup> (II Sam. 22:15).</p>
<p>25. AND HE TOOK OFF. <italic>Va-yasar</italic> (and He took off) is a <italic>hifil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2428">114</xref></sup> It should have been vocalized <italic>va-yaser</italic> with a <italic>segol</italic> beneath the <italic>samekh</italic>. I have already noted its grammatical explanation.<sup><xref rid="fn2429">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND HE TOOK OFF THEIR CHARIOT WHEELS.]<sup><xref rid="fn2430">116</xref></sup> Some say its meaning is that they<sup><xref rid="fn2431">117</xref></sup> untied the knot of the wheel<sup><xref rid="fn2432">118</xref></sup> from the horses<sup><xref rid="fn2433">119</xref></sup> so that, being lighter,<sup><xref rid="fn2434">120</xref></sup> they could flee more easily. However, the above-mentioned divine discomfit fell upon them and their horses, and they could only drive them with great difficulty.<sup><xref rid="fn2435">121</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>va-yasar</italic> comes from the root of <italic>sorer</italic> (rebellious) (Deut. 21:18).<sup><xref rid="fn2436">122</xref></sup> He who went before them wanted to turn the chariot around.<sup><xref rid="fn2437">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THE LORD FIGHTETH FOR THEM AGAINST THE EGYPTIANS. <italic>Lahem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2438">124</xref></sup> means for them.<sup><xref rid="fn2439">125</xref></sup> It now becomes clear that God&#x2019;s word, <italic>and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord</italic> (v. 4), which He spoke earlier meant: <italic>and the Egyptians shall know</italic> before their deaths.</p>
<p>26. THAT THE WATERS MAY COME BACK. The waters which served as walls for them should return to their previous state.</p>
<p>27. WHEN THE MORNING APPEARED. <italic>Lifnot boker</italic> (when the morning appeared) means toward morning.</p>
<p>TO ITS STRENGTH. <italic>Le-etano</italic> means to its strength. It is a noun,<sup><xref rid="fn2440">126</xref></sup> like <italic>etan</italic> in <italic>mighty rivers</italic> (Ps. 74:15).<sup><xref rid="fn2441">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>FLED AGAINST IT. I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn2442">128</xref></sup> that the Egyptians in fleeing thought that they were returning to dry land when in actuality they were going toward the sea.</p>
<p>May the bones of Chivi<sup><xref rid="fn2443">129</xref></sup> the dog<sup><xref rid="fn2444">130</xref></sup> be crushed. Chivi said that Moses knew the time of low tide, when the level of the sea goes down, and the time of high tide, when the sea comes in and its level rises, and so brought his people across the sea when the tide was normally low. However, Pharaoh did not know the manner of the sea and therefore drowned. This interpretation is sheer madness, as the sea is not normally dry in any place when its level goes down. However, all was dry.<sup><xref rid="fn2445">131</xref></sup> Neither do walls of water remain on the right or the left.<sup><xref rid="fn2446">132</xref></sup> Furthermore, the end of low tide and the beginning of high tide do not become clear until some hours have passed.<sup><xref rid="fn2447">133</xref></sup> Moreover, the Israelites had not yet finished crossing before Pharaoh and his army drowned.<sup><xref rid="fn2448">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE LORD OVERTHREW. <italic>Va-yena&#x2019;er</italic> (overthrew) is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el. Na&#x2019;arti</italic> (I shook) in <italic>Also I shook out my lap</italic> (Neh. 5:13) is similar to it.<sup><xref rid="fn2449">135</xref></sup> <italic>Va-yena&#x2019;er</italic> is to be understood in the manner of <italic>hath He thrown into the sea</italic> (Ex. 15: 1).<sup><xref rid="fn2450">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AND THE WATERS RETURNED. The waters that were walls returned.</p>
<p>SO MUCH AS ONE OF THEM. Even one of them did not escape.<sup><xref rid="fn2451">137</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>ad echad</italic> in <italic>and, behold, there was not so much as one</italic> (ad echad) <italic>of the cattle of the Israelites dead</italic> (Ex. 9:7). Indeed, the poet says, <italic>There was not one of them</italic> (echad me-hem) <italic>left</italic> (Ps. 106: 11).<sup><xref rid="fn2452">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. BUT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The reason this is noted a second time<sup><xref rid="fn2453">139</xref></sup> is that there remained some Israelites who were still crossing the sea while Pharaoh was drowning. This was a miracle within a miracle, for in the place where the Israelites were crossing the sea there was a strong east wind drying<sup><xref rid="fn2454">140</xref></sup> and where Pharaoh and his host were, God brought another wind to melt the waters that were frozen and formed walls. There were thus two winds in two places in the sea close to one another.<sup><xref rid="fn2455">141</xref></sup> True proof that this interpretation is correct is offered by the statement in the Song of Moses, <italic>And with the blast of Thy nostrils the waters were piled up</italic> (Ex. 15:8), which speaks of the wind that blew for Israel; and the statement, <italic>Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them</italic> (Ex. 15:10), which speaks of the wind that caused the Egyptians to drown. It is because of this that the end of the song reads, <italic>and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea</italic> (Ex. 15:19).</p>
<p>Do not ask, how could all of Israel cross in one night? Did not the six hundred thousand men on foot<sup><xref rid="fn2456">142</xref></sup> make up only a quarter of the camp?<sup><xref rid="fn2457">143</xref></sup> Perhaps they passed over some other way.<sup><xref rid="fn2458">144</xref></sup> Or perhaps the sea split into twelve parts, as the sages of blessed memory say.<sup><xref rid="fn2459">145</xref></sup> Now the Israelites did not cross the width of the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2460">146</xref></sup> On the contrary, they moved along its length and came out in the wilderness of Shur from wherein, as I will explain, they entered the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2461">147</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. THUS THE LORD SAVED. Now the Israelites were saved from the hand of the Egyptians. Until now the fear of Pharaoh was upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn2462">148</xref></sup> Scripture tells us that the Egyptians drowned in the sea. The sea did not cast their bodies out upon the dry land,<sup><xref rid="fn2463">149</xref></sup> for it is clearly written, <italic>The earth swallowed them</italic> (Ex. 15:12).<sup><xref rid="fn2464">150</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2465">151</xref></sup> therefore is: when the Egyptians drowned, the Israelites, who were on the shore, saw their dead bodies.<sup><xref rid="fn2466">152</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. FEARED. When Israel saw this great blow they feared God, as in <italic>And David was afraid of the Lord that day</italic> when Uzzah who put forth his hand to the ark of God died (II Sam. 6:9).</p>
<p>AND THEY BELIEVED IN THE LORD. They believed that the Lord is truth<sup><xref rid="fn2467">153</xref></sup> and that Moses is His servant and will do only that which the Lord commands him to do.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2315"><sup>1</sup> In other words, truthfully speaking one can not always fathom God&#x2019;s will.</ftnote>

Filwarg suggests emending <italic>ha-yoshevim</italic> (that sit) to <italic>ha-chashuvim</italic> (that are important), the idea being that important people have others who fight for them. The verse thus states: For there are many that fight for me on high as is the case with all important people. However, in I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary the reading is <italic>ha-moshekhim</italic>, which is a technical term for words that are to be read as if written twice. In this case our verse is to be read as follows: For there are many that fight for me, that fight for me on high, the reference being to angels who fight on his behalf. See I.E. on Ps. 56:3. In this case the last line of I.E. should be interpreted as: The meaning of on high is a war on high, as our verse belongs to those verses in which there is a word that is to be read as if written twice.</ftnote>

The Talmud speaks of the 72-letter name of God. See <italic>Sukkah</italic> 45a. Those who see the 72-letter name of God in these verses do so in one of the following two ways. They arrange the three verses on top of each other and arrive at God&#x2019;s name by reading down, i.e., <italic>vav, vav, vav; yod, yod, yod; samekh, bet, tet</italic>, etc. Or they invert verse 20 and arrange the three verses as above and read down, i.e., <italic>vav, heh, vav; yod, lamed, yod; samekh, alef, tet</italic>, and so on. The reason they invert the middle verse is that it states, <italic>and the one did not come near the other all the night</italic>; i.e., one is not to combine the letters of this verse in their normal fashion but they are to be read backwards as the word <italic>ha-laylah</italic> (the night) is.

<ftnote id="fn2389"><sup>75</sup> These three verses. In other words, verses 19-21 consist of 72 letters each, not because a combination of their letters spells out a secret name of God, but rather they allude to God (<italic>YHVH</italic>) whose might delivered Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2390"><sup>76</sup> I.E. insists that when the Talmud speaks of the 72-letter name of God it refers to the tetragrammaton (<italic>YHVH</italic>),which when calculated as follows, <italic>Y</italic> (10) <italic>YH</italic> (15) <italic>YHV</italic> (21) <italic>YHVH</italic> (26), comes to 72.

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 15</title>
<p>1. THEN SANG MOSES. It is Hebrew style to employ an imperfect preceded by the word <italic>az</italic> (then) in place of a perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn2468">1</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>Az yivneh shelomoh</italic> (then did Solomon build) (I Kings 11:7);<sup><xref rid="fn2469">2</xref></sup> <italic>az yedabber yehoshu&#x2019;a</italic> (then spoke Joshua) (Josh. 10:12);<sup><xref rid="fn2470">3</xref></sup> az <italic>yavdil mosheh</italic> (then Moses separated) (Deut. 4:41).<sup><xref rid="fn2471">4</xref></sup> The same is true in Arabic.</p>
<p>Moses composed the song by himself. He then taught it to all of Israel, each one of whom then sang and said, <italic>I will sing unto the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2472">5</xref></sup> <italic>And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people</italic> (Deut. 27:1) is similar. The commandment was first spoken only by Moses. The elders of Israel then repeated it to everyone.<sup><xref rid="fn2473">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SPOKE, SAYING.<sup><xref rid="fn2474">7</xref></sup> Each one of the Israelites was to say the following, or the following was to be said in every generation.</p>
<p>FOR HE IS HIGHLY EXALTED. He demonstrated His exaltation by casting both the mighty rider and his exalted and powerful steed into the sea as one casts an arrow. The meaning of <italic>ramah</italic> (thrown) in <italic>ramah va-yam</italic> (hath He thrown into the sea) is similar to the word <italic>rome</italic> (throws) in <italic>armed with that which a bow throws</italic> (Ps. 78:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2475">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH AND SONG. Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn2476">9</xref></sup> of blessed memory says that there is a difference between <italic>ozzi</italic> (my strength), which is vocalized with a furtive <italic>kamatz</italic>, and <italic>uzzi</italic>, which is vocalized with a <italic>kubbutz</italic>. He therefore says that the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>ozzi</italic> (my strength) in <italic>the Lord is my strength and song</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn2477">10</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Solomon does not offer another such instance.<sup><xref rid="fn2478">11</xref></sup> Rabbi Solomon goes on to say that <italic>ve-zimrat</italic> (and song) is in the construct with <italic>Yah</italic> (the Lord). He interprets our verse as if it read: The strength and vengeance<sup><xref rid="fn2479">12</xref></sup> of the Lord became my salvation.<sup><xref rid="fn2480">13</xref></sup> Rabbi Solomon thought that our verse is similar to <italic>va-yehi ba-yom ha-shelishi va-yissa avraham et enav</italic> (on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes) (Gen. 22:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2481">14</xref></sup> However, one who knows Arabic knows the difference between the two verses.<sup><xref rid="fn2482">15</xref></sup> It is neither correct Hebrew nor Arabic form to say <italic>ozzi ve-zimrat Yah va-yehi li li-shu&#x2019;ah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2483">16</xref></sup> There is no difference between <italic>ozzi</italic> vocalized with a furtive <italic>kamatz</italic> and the same word vocalized with a <italic>kubbutz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2484">17</xref></sup> For while Scripture reads, <italic>chukki</italic> (mine allotted)<sup><xref rid="fn2485">18</xref></sup> in <italic>Feed me with mine allotted bread</italic> (Prov. 30:8) it elsewhere reads, <italic>chokkha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2486">19</xref></sup> <italic>ve-chok ba-nekha</italic> (thy due, and thy son&#x2019;s due) (Lev. 10:13). Now we find the word <italic>ve-ozzekha</italic> (in Thy strength) (v. 13) vocalized with a furtive <italic>kamatz,</italic> later on in this song and similarly in <italic>O Lord, in Thy strength</italic> (be-ozzekha) <italic>the king re-joiceth</italic> (Ps. 21:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2487">20</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>ozzi</italic> is thus a first person suffix.</p>
<p>Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that the meaning of <italic>ve-zimrat Yah</italic> is, the Lord is my song,<sup><xref rid="fn2488">21</xref></sup> for the <italic>resh</italic> of <italic>ve-zimrat</italic> (and song) is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2489">22</xref></sup> Similarly,<sup><xref rid="fn2490">23</xref></sup> the meaning of <italic>shenat</italic> in <italic>I will not give sleep</italic> (shenat) <italic>to mine eyes</italic> (Ps. 132:4) is, my sleep,<sup><xref rid="fn2491">24</xref></sup> as <italic>shenat</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2492">25</xref></sup> Likewise, the meaning of <italic>nachalat,</italic> which is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2493">26</xref></sup> in <italic>Yea, I have a goodly heritage</italic> (nachalat) (Ps. 16:6) is my heritage.<sup><xref rid="fn2494">27</xref></sup> Similarly,<sup><xref rid="fn2495">28</xref></sup> the meaning of <italic>menat,</italic> which is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2496">29</xref></sup> in, <italic>O Lord, the portion</italic> (menat) <italic>of mine inheritance and of my cup</italic> (Ps. 16:5), is my portion.<sup><xref rid="fn2497">30</xref></sup> However, what will Rabbi Moses do with the word <italic>menat</italic> (portion) in <italic>the king&#x2019;s portion</italic> (II Chron. 31:3) in which <italic>menat</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> and is in the construct. It is the same case with the word <italic>yam</italic> (sea) in <italic>the salt sea</italic> (Num. 34:3) and in <italic>the sea</italic> (yam) <italic>of Chinnereth</italic> (Num. 34:11). Should one respond that the latter are irregular, we would tell him to place <italic>ozzi ve-zimrat Yah</italic> among them.<sup><xref rid="fn2498">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that the word <italic>ozzi</italic> (my strength) is, as is the style of the Hebrew language, to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn2499">32</xref></sup> Our clause is to be read as if written, <italic>ozzi, ve-zimrat ozzi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2500">33</xref></sup> Yah (The Lord is my strength and the song of my strength).<sup><xref rid="fn2501">34</xref></sup> The reason behind this verse is that Moses earlier mentioned, <italic>The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea</italic> (v. 4). Moses now states that this was not through his own majesty and strength. On the contrary, he confesses, my strength and the glory of my strength<sup><xref rid="fn2502">35</xref></sup> is <italic>Yah</italic> alone who is the Lord.</p>
<p><italic>Yah</italic> is, as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn2503">36</xref></sup> one of the three proper names of God. All three<sup><xref rid="fn2504">37</xref></sup> come from one root.<sup><xref rid="fn2505">38</xref></sup> Since the word <italic>eheyeh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2506">39</xref></sup> is frequently employed in speech it was necessary to substitute a <italic>vav</italic> for a <italic>yod</italic> in God&#x2019;s glorious name.<sup><xref rid="fn2507">40</xref></sup> The word <italic>Yah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2508">41</xref></sup> is likewise known.<sup><xref rid="fn2509">42</xref></sup> Its <italic>yod</italic> was vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> because of the guttural<sup><xref rid="fn2510">43</xref></sup> and the silent <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2511">44</xref></sup> was dropped<sup><xref rid="fn2512">45</xref></sup> because it has another secret numerical meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn2513">46</xref></sup> We find <italic>Yah</italic> combined with God&#x2019;s glorious name in <italic>ki ozzi ve-zimrat Yah YHVH</italic> (for God the Lord is my strength and song) (Is. 12:2). I have already explained that the name <italic>YHVH</italic> is at times a proper name and at times an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn2514">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>THIS IS MY GOD. My power.<sup><xref rid="fn2515">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND I WILL GLORIFY HIM. I will place Him in a building.<sup><xref rid="fn2516">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THIS.] The word <italic>zeh</italic> (this) is to be read as if written twice. The last clause of our verse is to be read as if written: And this is my father&#x2019;s God, the reference being to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2517">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND I WILL EXALT HIM. For I will recount His might.</p>
<p>3. THE LORD IS A MAN OF WAR. The Lord supports those who love Him and cleave unto Him and He is a man of war to their enemies.</p>
<p>[MAN.] The word <italic>ish</italic> (man) means a being.<sup><xref rid="fn2518">51</xref></sup> Scripture thus states in reference to the stars, <italic>ish lo nedar</italic> (not one faileth) (Is. 40:26); and in reference to the living creatures, <italic>ish el ever panav yelekhu</italic> (they went every one straight forward) (Ezek. 1:9); and in reference to the angels, <italic>ve-ha-ish gavriel</italic> (the man Gabriel) (Dan. 9:21). The meaning of <italic>ish milchamah</italic> (a man of war) thus is, a being who wages war. It is similar to the term <italic>ish emunim</italic> (a faithful man) (Prov. 20:6), the meaning of which is, a being<sup><xref rid="fn2519">52</xref></sup> imbued with faith.</p>
<p>THE LORD IS HIS NAME. His name will now be known. Compare, <italic>That calleth for the waters of the sea, And poureth them out upon the face of the earth; The Lord is His name</italic> (Amos 5:8). He alone can do such a thing.<sup><xref rid="fn2520">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. PHARAOH&#x2019;S CHARIOTS. God, as it were, cast Pharaoh&#x2019;s heavy chariots and their hosts as if they were a light arrow.</p>
<p>[AND HIS CHOSEN CAPTAINS.] Moses made mention of <italic>his chosen captains</italic> &#x201C;who were over all them&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2521">54</xref></sup> because he had previously spoken of Pharaoh&#x2019;s hosts.</p>
<p>[THE RED SEA.] Yefet<sup><xref rid="fn2522">55</xref></sup> says that <italic>suf</italic> in <italic>yam suf</italic> (the Red Sea) has the same meaning as the word <italic>suf</italic> (flags) in <italic>The reeds and flags shall wither</italic> (Is. 19:6) and the word <italic>suf</italic> in <italic>and laid it in the flags</italic> (Ex. 2:3). For reeds and rushes grow around the <italic>yam suf</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2523">56</xref></sup> and not around other seas.<sup><xref rid="fn2524">57</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Joshua says that <italic>suf</italic> is the name of a city.<sup><xref rid="fn2525">58</xref></sup> It is like <italic>yam kinneret</italic> (the sea of Chinnereth) (Josh. 13:27).<sup><xref rid="fn2526">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. THE DEEPS. The deeps of the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn2527">60</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>The earth swallowed them</italic> (v. 11).</p>
<p>[COVER THEM.] A <italic>shuruk</italic> has been substituted for a <italic>cholam</italic> in <italic>yekhasyumu</italic> (cover them).<sup><xref rid="fn2528">61</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>ta&#x2019;avuri</italic> (pass) in <italic>neither pass from hence</italic> (Ruth 2:8).<sup><xref rid="fn2529">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE DEPTHS. <italic>Metzolot</italic> (the depths) means the deep waters. Similarly <italic>va-tashlikheni metuzlah,</italic> (for thou did cast me into the deep waters) (Jonah 2:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2530">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. GLORIOUS. The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>nedari</italic> (glorious) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn2531">64</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>akhzari</italic> (cruel).<sup><xref rid="fn2532">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THY RIGHT HAND.] The repetition of the phrase <italic>Thy right hand, O Lord</italic> indicates the same as the repetition of <italic>For, lo, Thine enemies, O Lord</italic> (Ps. 92:10)<sup><xref rid="fn2533">66</xref></sup> and <italic>The floods have lifted up</italic> (Ps. 93:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2534">67</xref></sup> It indicates time and time again. Its meaning is: your right hand dashes the enemy in pieces times without number.</p>
<p>[GLORIOUS IN POWER.] <italic>Glorious in power</italic> refers to God.<sup><xref rid="fn2535">68</xref></sup> However, there are those who say that it refers to the Lord&#x2019;s right hand.<sup><xref rid="fn2536">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND IN THE GREATNESS OF THY EXCELLENCE. Which is superior to all who exalt themselves. You are able to shatter (overthrow) those that rise up against You. You need no iron weapons to shatter them. All You have to do is send forth Your wrath and <italic>it consumeth them as stubble, for God&#x2019;s wrath</italic> is as hot as fire.</p>
<p>8. AND WITH THE BLAST OF THY NOSTRILS. You rebuke the waters and they congeal. Compare, <italic>By the breath of God they perish</italic> (Job 4:9).</p>
<p>THE WATERS WERE PILED UP. The word <italic>ne&#x2019;ermu</italic> (were piled up) is similar to the word <italic>aremat</italic> (a heap of) in <italic>a heap of wheat</italic> (Cant. 7:3).</p>
<p>THE FLOODS STOOD UPRIGHT AS A HEAP. The waters, whose nature is to flow and descend, turned into a heap (<italic>ned</italic>), as in <italic>And rose up in one heap</italic> (ned) (Josh. 4:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2537">70</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ned</italic> (heap) is a wall.</p>
<p>THE DEEPS WERE CONGEALED. <italic>Kafe&#x2019;u</italic> means were congealed. Compare, <italic>ve-kippa&#x2019;on</italic> (frost) (Zech. 14:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2538">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE HEART OF THE SEA. The heart lies in the middle of the body from the point of view of the body&#x2019;s width.<sup><xref rid="fn2539">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. THE ENEMY SAID. The reference is to Pharaoh.</p>
<p>[SHALL BE SATISFIED UPON THEM.] The word <italic>timla&#x2019;emo</italic> (shall be satisfied upon them) is difficult.<sup><xref rid="fn2540">73</xref></sup> Rabbi Merinus explains that <italic>timla&#x2019;emo nafshi</italic> (my lust shall be satisfied upon them) means: my person<sup><xref rid="fn2541">74</xref></sup> shall be full of them;<sup><xref rid="fn2542">75</xref></sup> i.e., I will take all of their wealth. The term <italic>timla&#x2019;emo</italic> is to be understood like the term <italic>yetza&#x2019;uni</italic> (gone forth of me)<sup><xref rid="fn2543">76</xref></sup> in <italic>My children are gone forth of me</italic> (Jer. 10:20). Its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn2544">77</xref></sup> is connected to <italic>I will divide the spoil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2545">78</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>timla&#x2019;emo</italic> is used in the same sense as the word <italic>me&#x2019;lo&#x2019;o</italic> (presume)<sup><xref rid="fn2546">79</xref></sup> in <italic>that durst presume in his heart</italic> (Esth. 7:5).<sup><xref rid="fn2547">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>[MY HAND SHALL DESTROY THEM.] After doing the latter<sup><xref rid="fn2548">81</xref></sup> I shall destroy them.</p>
<p>MY HAND SHALL DESTROY THEM. <italic>Torishemo</italic> means shall destroy them.<sup><xref rid="fn2549">82</xref></sup> Similarly the word <italic>torishu</italic> (you will destroy) in <italic>But if you will not destroy</italic> (Num. 34:55).<sup><xref rid="fn2550">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. THOU DIDST BLOW WITH THY WIND. <italic>Nashafta</italic> (Thou didst blow) comes from the same root as <italic>neshef</italic> (night). The meaning of <italic>nashafta ve-ruchakha</italic> (Thou didst blow with Thy wind) is: You brought a wind at night that drowned them.<sup><xref rid="fn2551">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEY SANK. <italic>Tzalelu</italic> (they sank) comes from the same root as <italic>metzolot</italic> (depths). Compare, <italic>My lips quivered</italic> (tzalelu) <italic>at the voice</italic> (Hab. 3:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2552">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE MIGHTY WATERS. This is connected to <italic>they sank.</italic> Our verse is to be read as if written: they sank<sup><xref rid="fn2553">86</xref></sup> as lead in the mighty waters.</p>
<p>AS LEAD. <italic>Oferet</italic> (lead) comes from the same root as <italic>afar</italic> (dust).<sup><xref rid="fn2554">87</xref></sup> If one puts any of the six kinds of metal<sup><xref rid="fn2555">88</xref></sup> in the ground each will lose one of its familiar elements in a given number of years.<sup><xref rid="fn2556">89</xref></sup> However, lead will always maintain itself.</p>
<p>11. WHO IS LIKE UNTO THEE, O LORD, AMONG THE MIGHTY. <italic>Elim</italic> (the mighty) refers to the holy angels in the celestial heights. <italic>The sons of the mighty</italic> (bene elim)<sup><xref rid="fn2557">90</xref></sup> refers to the stars. I will explain this further in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa.</italic></p>
<p>GLORIOUS IN HOLINESS. The reference is to the Throne of Glory.</p>
<p>[FEARFUL IN PRAISES, DOING WONDERS.] For all who want to acclaim God are afraid to praise His name because who can recite all of His praises. However, they are obligated to praise Him because He alone does wonders.</p>
<p>12. THOU STRETCHEDST OUT THY RIGHT HAND. Your wonders<sup><xref rid="fn2558">91</xref></sup> were manifest when You stretched forth Your hand from the highest realm of the celestial heights where Your name is exalted, and the ground which is beneath all earthly creatures swallowed up the enemy of Israel. Your right hand, which is above the heaven of heavens, reached, as it were, in a moment to the bottom of the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2559">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THY RIGHT HAND.] Its meaning is, Thy strength.</p>
<p>13. THOU IN THY LOVE HAST LED. Moses used the perfect <italic>nachita</italic> (led) in place of the imperfect,<sup><xref rid="fn2560">93</xref></sup> as is the style in prophecy.<sup><xref rid="fn2561">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN THY LOVE.] The reference is to the pillars of cloud and fire, for God led them.<sup><xref rid="fn2562">95</xref></sup> On the other hand, it might allude to the fact that God led them up till now.<sup><xref rid="fn2563">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU HAST LED. <italic>Nehalta</italic> (thou hast led) is similar to <italic>etnahalah</italic> (I will journey) in <italic>I will lead on</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2564">97</xref></sup> <italic>gently</italic> (Gen. 33:14).<sup><xref rid="fn2565">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THY STRENGTH. Not by their strength.</p>
<p>TO THY HOLY HABITATION. The reference is to Mount Sinai where God&#x2019;s Glory dwelt. It is similarly written, <italic>and brought you unto Myself</italic> (Ex. 19:4).</p>
<p>14. THE PEOPLES HAVE HEARD. The reference is to the peoples round about them and also to the peoples whom they would pass by.<sup><xref rid="fn2566">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>PANGS HAVE TAKEN HOLD ON THE INHABITANTS OF PHILISTIA. The inhabitants of the land of Philistia.<sup><xref rid="fn2567">100</xref></sup> The word inhabitants indicates this.<sup><xref rid="fn2568">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. THE MIGHTY MEN. <italic>Ele</italic> (mighty men) spelled with a <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2569">102</xref></sup> means sheep,<sup><xref rid="fn2570">103</xref></sup> for the sheep have leaders.<sup><xref rid="fn2571">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THEN WERE THE CHIEFS OF EDOM AFFRIGHTED&#x2026;THE MIGHTY MEN OF MOAB, TREMBLING TAKETH HOLD UPON THEM.] The Philistines, the Edomites, and the Moabites did not wage war with the Israelites in the wilderness.<sup><xref rid="fn2572">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>ALL THE INHABITANTS OF CANAAN ARE MELTED AWAY. Because of the reports which they received, as in <italic>And as soon as we heard it, our hearts did melt</italic> (Josh. 2:11). <italic>The inhabitants of Canaan</italic> is also<sup><xref rid="fn2573">106</xref></sup> to be interpreted as the inhabitants of the land of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn2574">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. TERROR AND DREAD FALLETH UPON THEM. This refers to Edom and Moab even though Canaan is mentioned above.<sup><xref rid="fn2575">108</xref></sup> <italic>He spoke unto them in a pillar of cloud</italic> (Ps. 99:79) is, as I have explained, similar.<sup><xref rid="fn2576">109</xref></sup> Likewise, <italic>and shed the blood of war in peace</italic> (I Kings 2:5) only refers to Abner.<sup><xref rid="fn2577">110</xref></sup> So too, <italic>and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants; and they bore children</italic> refers to Abimelech&#x2019;s wife and handmaids.<sup><xref rid="fn2578">111</xref></sup> All of this<sup><xref rid="fn2579">112</xref></sup> because Scripture reads, <italic>Till thy people pass over, O Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2580">113</xref></sup> For Israel passed them<sup><xref rid="fn2581">114</xref></sup> before they came to the land of Canaan. Moses repeated <italic>Till Thy people pass</italic> because they circled Mount Seir for many days.<sup><xref rid="fn2582">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THOU HAST GOTTEN.] Its meaning is: they were slaves in Egypt and Thou hast gotten them to be Your servants.</p>
<p>17. THOU BRINGEST THEM IN, AND PLANTEST THEM IN THE MOUNTAIN OF THINE INHERITANCE. A prayer that Israel remain long in the land and not be exiled from it.<sup><xref rid="fn2583">116</xref></sup> Our verse is like <italic>in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it</italic> (Ezek. 17:23).</p>
<p>IN THE MOUNTAIN. <italic>The goodly hill country and Lebanon</italic> (Deut. 3:25)<sup><xref rid="fn2584">117</xref></sup> is similar. Or it alludes to Mount Moriah.<sup><xref rid="fn2585">118</xref></sup> It is therefore followed by <italic>The place, O Lord, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in.</italic></p>
<p>[WHICH THOU HAST MADE.] Its meaning is: which Thou hast prepared as a place for a sanctuary for Thyself.<sup><xref rid="fn2586">119</xref></sup> The place mentioned lies opposite the glorious celestial place,<sup><xref rid="fn2587">120</xref></sup> for the places on earth vary in accordance with the star that is over them.<sup><xref rid="fn2588">121</xref></sup> Those who are versed in the science that deals with the constellations will understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn2589">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE SANCTUARY.] The word <italic>mikkedash</italic> (sanctuary)<sup><xref rid="fn2590">123</xref></sup> has the same meaning as <italic>mikdash</italic> (sanctuary).<sup><xref rid="fn2591">124</xref></sup> The word <italic>mittoharo</italic> (his brightness) in <italic>Thou hast made his brightness to cease</italic> (Ps. 89:45) is similar, as the <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>tet</italic> is superfluous, like the <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>kof</italic> of <italic>mikkedash</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2592">125</xref></sup> The <italic>dalet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2593">126</xref></sup> does not receive a <italic>dagesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2594">127</xref></sup> because the <italic>kof</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2595">128</xref></sup> is vocalized with a mobile <italic>sheva</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2596">129</xref></sup> With the exception of the form <italic>shetayim</italic> we do not find it to be the way of Scripture to place a <italic>dagesh</italic> in a word which follows a mobile <italic>sheva.</italic> I have already noted its grammatical uniqueness.<sup><xref rid="fn2597">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHICH THY HANDS HAVE ESTABLISHED. Its meaning is similar to <italic>thou hast made,<sup><xref rid="fn2598">131</xref></sup></italic> for Scripture repeats itself.</p>
<p>18. THE LORD SHALL REIGN. God&#x2019;s Kingship will be seen when the Holy Temple<sup><xref rid="fn2599">132</xref></sup> which will be dedicated to His name shall be built.</p>
<p>[FOR EVER AND EVER.] <italic>Le-olam va-ed</italic> (for ever and ever)<sup><xref rid="fn2600">133</xref></sup> is an abridgment. The full form is <italic>le-olam ve-ad</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2601">134</xref></sup> <italic>olam</italic> (for ever and until ever). Do not be amazed that the word <italic>ed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2602">135</xref></sup> is not in the construct,<sup><xref rid="fn2603">136</xref></sup> for we find, <italic>shokhen ad</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2604">137</xref></sup><italic>ve-kadosh shemo</italic> (That inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy) (Is. 57:15). It is the custom of Hebrew to vocalize a <italic>vav</italic> with a <italic>pattach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2605">138</xref></sup> when the syllable which follows it is accented.<sup><xref rid="fn2606">139</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>va-ez</italic> (or goat) in <italic>of ox, or sheep, or goat</italic> (Lev. 7:23). It is for this reason that <italic>va-ed</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2607">140</xref></sup> Now Scripture reads, <italic>va-okhal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2608">141</xref></sup> <italic>mi-kol</italic> (I have eaten of all) (Gen. 27:33). However, at the end of a verse it reads, <italic>ha-nachash hishi&#x2019;ani va-okhel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2609">142</xref></sup> (the serpent beguiled me, and I did eat) (Gen. 3:13). Hence the statement, <italic>le-olam va-ed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2610">143</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. FOR THE HORSES OF PHARAOH. This verse is, in my opinion, part of the song.<sup><xref rid="fn2611">144</xref></sup> Its purpose is to recall the wonder within the wonder,<sup><xref rid="fn2612">145</xref></sup> which I have noted.<sup><xref rid="fn2613">146</xref></sup></p>
<p>[UPON THEM.] Upon them refers to <italic>the horses of Pharaoh&#x2026;his chariots and his horsemen.</italic> It also includes Pharaoh.<sup><xref rid="fn2614">147</xref></sup> For Scripture clearly states, <italic>The enemy</italic> (Pharaoh) <italic>said</italic> (v. 9) and then goes on to say, <italic>The earth swallowed them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2615">148</xref></sup> (v. 12). Furthermore, it is explicitly written, <italic>But</italic> (God) <italic>overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea</italic> (Ps. 136:15).</p>
<p>22. AND MOSES LED. I believe that the pillar of cloud, and likewise the pillar of fire, that went before the people when they left Egypt was to ensure that Israel was able to <italic>go by day and by night</italic> (Ex. 13:21). After Pharaoh and his hosts drowned, Israel was no longer frightened and did not travel at night.<sup><xref rid="fn2616">149</xref></sup> Indeed, we do not find it recorded in the Torah portion <italic>Be-Halotekha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2617">150</xref></sup> that Israel journeyed at night. Behold, Moses now led the people according to God&#x2019;s command.<sup><xref rid="fn2618">151</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are only six journeys from the Red Sea until Mount Sinai<sup><xref rid="fn2619">152</xref></sup> lasting less than forty days.<sup><xref rid="fn2620">153</xref></sup> The air<sup><xref rid="fn2621">154</xref></sup> is then good. It is neither humid nor cold. He who does not have a tent can live outdoors<sup><xref rid="fn2622">155</xref></sup> without harm. When Israel came to the wilderness of Sinai they all erected booths,<sup><xref rid="fn2623">156</xref></sup> as they camped there for about year. Moses informed them that they would tarry there until they constructed the Tabernacle. It was for this reason that, as I will explain,<sup><xref rid="fn2624">157</xref></sup> Israel brought out acacia wood from Egypt. The festival of booths was established in commemoration of the booths that Israel made there, for Scripture states, <italic>that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt</italic> (Lev. 23:43). How can one maintain that Israel dwelt in clouds?<sup><xref rid="fn2625">158</xref></sup> For the booths do not resemble clouds.<sup><xref rid="fn2626">159</xref></sup> I will yet explain why the festival of Sukkot is observed in the seventh month.<sup><xref rid="fn2627">160</xref></sup> When the Tabernacle was erected God descended upon it in a pillar of cloud, as it is clearly written, <italic>and there was fire therein by night</italic> (Ex. 40:38). When the cloud journeyed the children of Israel went onward (Ex. 40:36). It is because of this that Scripture reads, <italic>and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day</italic> (Num. 14:14). There were thus two interchanging pillars<sup><xref rid="fn2628">161</xref></sup> over the Tabernacle. If the statement to the effect that there were seven interchanging pillars over the Tabernacle<sup><xref rid="fn2629">162</xref></sup> is based on tradition, then we will rely on tradition and set aside our own opinions.</p>
<p>INTO THE WILDERNESS OF SHUR. This is the very wilderness of Etham.<sup><xref rid="fn2630">163</xref></sup> Perhaps there were two cities in the wilderness that were so called.<sup><xref rid="fn2631">164</xref></sup> Or the wilderness had two names.<sup><xref rid="fn2632">165</xref></sup> <italic>And they went three days in the wilderness,</italic> the reference being to the wilderness of Shur, is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn2633">166</xref></sup> Therefore to indicate this<sup><xref rid="fn2634">167</xref></sup> the <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ba-midbar</italic> (in the wilderness), which precedes <italic>and found no water,</italic> was vocalized for emphasis with a <italic>pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2635">168</xref></sup></p>
<p>[23.] AND WHEN THEY CAME TO MARAH. It is elsewhere written, <italic>And they journeyed from the Red Sea</italic> (Num. 33:11). The latter is similar to <italic>And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2636">169</xref></sup> (<italic>and they went out into the wilderness of Shur and came to Marah</italic>) (v. 22). We similarly find, <italic>and they went three days&#x2019; journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah</italic> (Num. 33:8).<sup><xref rid="fn2637">170</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. THEREFORE THE NAME OF IT WAS CALLED MARAH.<sup><xref rid="fn2638">171</xref></sup> Someone called it Marah.<sup><xref rid="fn2639">172</xref></sup> <italic>Who was born unto Levi in Egypt</italic> (Num. 26:29)<sup><xref rid="fn2640">173</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>24. AND THE PEOPLE MURMURED. <italic>Va-yillonu</italic> (murmured) is a <italic>nifal.</italic> It is similar to <italic>ve-yikkonu</italic> (shall be established)<sup><xref rid="fn2641">174</xref></sup> in <italic>And thy thoughts shall be established</italic> (Prov. 16:3), which comes from the same root as <italic>nakhonu</italic> (prepared) (Prov. 19:29).<sup><xref rid="fn2642">175</xref></sup> It comes from a double root<sup><xref rid="fn2643">176</xref></sup> or from a root in which the middle letter is missing.<sup><xref rid="fn2644">177</xref></sup> If it came from a root which begins with a <italic>nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2645">178</xref></sup> it would have followed the paradigm of <italic>va-yiggashu</italic> (came near) (Gen. 45:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2646">179</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND HE CRIED UNTO THE LORD; AND THE LORD SHOWED HIM A TREE. We do not know what type of tree this was.<sup><xref rid="fn2647">180</xref></sup> What happened can only be described as a miracle. If the waters were stationary<sup><xref rid="fn2648">181</xref></sup> then we would say that they were medicinally sweetened.<sup><xref rid="fn2649">182</xref></sup> What the sages said is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn2650">183</xref></sup></p>
<p>THERE HE MADE FOR THEM. God<sup><xref rid="fn2651">184</xref></sup> for Israel.</p>
<p>A STATUTE AND AN ORDINANCE. To discipline them and to instruct them.</p>
<p>[AND THERE HE PROVED THEM.] This is to be understood in the manner of <italic>for the Lord your God putteth you to proof, to know whether ye do love the Lord your God with all you heart and with all your soul</italic> (Deut. 13:4). Scripture similarly states, <italic>And He afflicted thee,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2652">185</xref></sup> <italic>and suffered thee to hunger</italic> (Deut. 8:3); <italic>and that He might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end</italic> (Deut. 8:16),<sup><xref rid="fn2653">186</xref></sup> that is, to do good to those who did not murmur against Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2654">187</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. AND HE SAID: IF THOU WILT DILIGENTLY HEARKEN. I have already noted that when the word <italic>shema</italic> (hearken) is followed by a <italic>lamed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2655">188</xref></sup> or a <italic>bet</italic> it does not mean to hear the words being spoken but rather to understand the subject which is being verbalized. <italic>Shema</italic> in our verse thus means to understand what the Lord commands us to do.</p>
<p>AND WILT DO THAT WHICH IS RIGHT IN HIS EYES. This refers to the positive commandments.</p>
<p>AND WILT GIVE EAR TO HIS COMMANDMENTS. To understand what the negative commandments consist of.</p>
<p>AND KEEP ALL HIS STATUTES. Not to violate them. Compare, <italic>And ye shall not walk in the statutes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2656">189</xref></sup> <italic>of the nation</italic> (Lev. 20:23). It is God&#x2019;s statute not to imitate the practices of the nations.<sup><xref rid="fn2657">190</xref></sup></p>
<p>[NONE OF THE DISEASES.] Its meaning is, the diseases you should remember. For you saw with your own eyes the diseases, the strokes, and the plagues which I put upon the Egyptians because they rebelled against Me. Now if you will hearken to My statutes you will be saved from these plagues, for I will not do to you what I did to them. Additionally, you have no need of a physician for I am the Lord that healeth thee from all disease which I have decreed to be upon the earth. I will heal you as I healed the bitter waters which no physician has the ability to heal. Behold, what happened at Marah was the opposite of what occurred when the first plague struck, for the waters of the Nile were sweet but the Egyptians could not drink from them.<sup><xref rid="fn2658">191</xref></sup> However, here<sup><xref rid="fn2659">192</xref></sup> the bitter waters turned sweet. You should therefore love the Lord and keep yourself from rebelling against Him, for He will do good for you.</p>
<p>27. AND THEY CAME TO ELIM. Saadiah Gaon says there were seventy species of palm trees there.<sup><xref rid="fn2660">193</xref></sup> Others added, for each and every tribe.<sup><xref rid="fn2661">194</xref></sup> Others said, for each and every person.<sup><xref rid="fn2662">195</xref></sup> However, there is no need for these interpretations, for the springs of water, of which there were twelve, and the seventy palm trees did not come into being now because of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2663">196</xref></sup> Additionally, this was not the time for the ripening of palms.<sup><xref rid="fn2664">197</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that Israel tarried in Marah for only one day<sup><xref rid="fn2665">198</xref></sup> and that they stayed in Elim for about twenty days.<sup><xref rid="fn2666">199</xref></sup> Scripture therefore says, <italic>and they encamped there by the waters</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2667">200</xref></sup> The next verse therefore informs us that Israel journeyed from Elim on the fifteenth day of the second month.<sup><xref rid="fn2668">201</xref></sup> Now Israel camped in the following four places<sup><xref rid="fn2669">202</xref></sup> in fifteen days:<sup><xref rid="fn2670">203</xref></sup> the wilderness of Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn2671">204</xref></sup> Dophkah, Alush, and Rephidim, for they came to the desert of Sinai at the beginning of the third month.<sup><xref rid="fn2672">205</xref></sup> Scripture mentions the palm trees to let us know that contrary to the waters of Marah the waters here were sweet, for palm trees cannot flourish in a land of bitter waters.<sup><xref rid="fn2673">206</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2468"><sup>1</sup> <italic>Az yashir mosheh</italic> (then sang Moses) literally means: then Moses will sing. I.E. points out that an imperfect preceded by the word <italic>az</italic> occasionally has the meaning of a perfect.

<ftnote id="fn2477"><sup>10</sup> According to Rashi the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>ozzi</italic> is not a first person pronominal suffix. The word <italic>ozzi</italic> has the same meaning as the word <italic>oz</italic>. It means strength. Cf. Rashi&#x2019;s comment on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2478"><sup>11</sup> Actually Rashi does. He offers <italic>ha-yoshevi</italic> (enthroned) and <italic>shokheni</italic> (dwelt), the <italic>yods</italic> of both of which are superfluous. Cf. Filwarg. If this is what I.E. meant then he must have quoted Rashi from memory and erred. However, it is possible that what I.E. means is that Rashi offered no other instance of two words ending in a <italic>yod</italic> coming from the same root, one word vocalized with a <italic>kubbutz,</italic> the other with a <italic>kamatz,</italic> with the <italic>yod</italic> of one superfluous and the <italic>yod</italic> of the other a first person pronominal suffix.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2479"><sup>12</sup> According to Rashi <italic>ve-zimrat</italic> (and song) is to be rendered, and vengeance. Rashi connects <italic>ve-zimrat</italic> to <italic>zamar,</italic> which means to prune or cut. God, as it were, pruned Israel&#x2019;s enemies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2480"><sup>13</sup> Rashi reads our verse as one clause. The problem with this reading is that the second part of the sentence starts with <italic>va-yehi</italic> (and he is become), which usually opens a new clause. Hence Rashi points out that <italic>va-yehi</italic> at times has the meaning of <italic>hayah,</italic> which continues a thought rather than starting a new clause.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2481"><sup>14</sup> Wherein <italic>va-yissa</italic> (lifted up), which is grammatically similar to <italic>va-yehi,</italic> does not begin a new clause but rather continues a thought.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2482"><sup>15</sup> Knows when an inverted imperfect such as <italic>va-yehi</italic> or <italic>va-yissa</italic> can be used with the meaning of <italic>hayah</italic> or <italic>nasa</italic> and when it cannot, for Hebrew and Arabic are sister languages.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2483"><sup>16</sup> That is, to connect part a and b of the line and read it as one clause. Hence <italic>va-yehi li li-shu&#x2019;ah</italic> cannot mean: became my salvation, but rather, <italic>And He is become my salvation.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2484"><sup>17</sup> In other words, contra Rashi, <italic>ozzi</italic> and <italic>uzzi</italic> mean the same.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2485"><sup>18</sup> With a <italic>kubbutz.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2486"><sup>19</sup> Vocalized with a furtive <italic>kamatz.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2487"><sup>20</sup> <italic>Ozzekha</italic> is the word <italic>oz</italic> plus the second person pronominal suffix. Similarly, <italic>ozzi</italic> is the word <italic>oz</italic> plus the first person pronominal suffix. This contra Rashi, who maintains that the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>ozzi</italic> is superfluous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2488"><sup>21</sup> In other words, <italic>ve-zimrat</italic> (and song) is short for <italic>ve-zimrati</italic> (and my song).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2489"><sup>22</sup> Hence <italic>ve-zimrat</italic> cannot be in the construct with <italic>Yah,</italic> for if <italic>ve-zimrat</italic> were in the construct with <italic>Yah</italic> it would be vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> rather than with a <italic>kamatz.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2490"><sup>23</sup> According to Rabbi Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2491"><sup>24</sup> For <italic>shenat</italic> is short for <italic>shenati</italic> (my sleep).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2492"><sup>25</sup> Rather than with a <italic>pattach.</italic> If <italic>shenat</italic> were vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> it would be in the construct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2493"><sup>26</sup> Rather than with a <italic>pattach.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2494"><sup>27</sup> For <italic>nachalat</italic> is short for <italic>nachalati</italic> (my heritage).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2495"><sup>28</sup> According to Rabbi Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2496"><sup>29</sup> Rather than with a <italic>pattach.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2497"><sup>30</sup> For <italic>menat</italic> is short for <italic>menati</italic> (my portion).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2498"><sup>31</sup> Once it is established that a word ending in <italic>kamatz tav</italic> is occasionally in the construct it is possible to interpret <italic>ve-zimrat</italic> as being in the construct with <italic>Yah.</italic> Hence there is no need for the novel interpretation that <italic>ve-zimrat</italic> is short for <italic>ve-zimrati.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2499"><sup>32</sup> I.E. makes this point throughout his commentary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2500"><sup>33</sup> <italic>Ve-zimrat</italic> is in the construct with <italic>ozzi,</italic> which is carried over from the first part of the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2501"><sup>34</sup> Literally, my strength, and the song of my strength is the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2502"><sup>35</sup> I.E. interprets <italic>the song of my strength</italic> to mean: the glory of my strength.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2503"><sup>36</sup> Cf. I.E. on Ex. 3:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2504"><sup>37</sup> <italic>YHVH, EHEYEH, YAH.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2505"><sup>38</sup> <italic>Heh, yod, heh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2506"><sup>39</sup> Which means I will be, and is also one of the names of God. See Ex. 3:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2507"><sup>40</sup> The point is, since God&#x2019;s name comes from the root <italic>heh, yod, heh,</italic> the form <italic>YHVH</italic> was used for God&#x2019;s name rather than <italic>YHYH,</italic> which means he will be, and is frequently employed in speech. Filwarg suggests emending our textto read: since the word <italic>yihyeh</italic> is frequently employed in speech it was necessary for a <italic>vav</italic> to be substituted for a <italic>yod</italic> in God&#x2019;s glorious name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2508"><sup>41</sup> Short for <italic>YHVH.</italic> What I.E. means by <italic>Yah</italic> are the letters <italic>yod heh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2509"><sup>42</sup> It is known that <italic>Yah</italic> is short for <italic>yehi</italic> (let there be) (Filwarg). Filwarg suggests emending to: The word <italic>yehi</italic> is likewise frequently employed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2510"><sup>43</sup> Because it precedes a <italic>heh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2511"><sup>44</sup> Since <italic>Yah</italic> is short for <italic>YHVH,</italic> its shortened form should be <italic>YHY</italic> (yehi), as <italic>YHVH</italic> is really <italic>YHYH</italic> (which stands for <italic>yehiyeh</italic>), the <italic>vav</italic> being substituted for a <italic>heh.</italic> Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. For I.E.&#x2019;s explanation of the divine name see I.E. on Ex. 3:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2512"><sup>45</sup> And a <italic>vav</italic> was not substituted for it as in the full name of God (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2513"><sup>46</sup> If the letters of the name <italic>Yah</italic> are spelled out and then computed they come to 26. The latter is the same as the numerical equivalent of the letters making up the divine name <italic>YHVH</italic>. <italic>Yah</italic> is spelled <italic>yod heh</italic>. <italic>Yod heh</italic> spelled out &#x003D; 26. That is, <italic>yod</italic> spelled out comes to 20: <italic>yod</italic> (10), <italic>vav</italic> (6), <italic>dalet</italic> (4). <italic>Heh,</italic> which is spelled <italic>heh</italic> (5), <italic>alef</italic> (1), comes to 6. The full name of God, <italic>Y</italic> (10) <italic>H</italic> (5) <italic>V</italic> (6) <italic>H</italic> (5), comes to 26. Thus <italic>Yah</italic> &#x003D; <italic>YHVH.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2514"><sup>47</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 3:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2515"><sup>48</sup> <italic>El</italic> (God) means power. Hence <italic>Eli</italic> (my God) means my power. See I.E. on Ex. 3:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2516"><sup>49</sup> I will erect for Him a temple. I.E. connects <italic>ve-anvehu</italic> (and I will glorify Him) to <italic>naveh</italic> (habitation), hence his translation. See Onkelos and Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2517"><sup>50</sup> In other words, &#x201C;my father&#x201D; refers to the patriarchs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2518"><sup>51</sup> Or an entity. I.E. makes a similar point in his comments on Gen 15:10. Translating <italic>ish</italic> as a being obviously eliminates an anthropomorphism.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2519"><sup>52</sup> Cf. Krinsky and Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2520"><sup>53</sup> After God does a wondrous thing people speak of it and His name thus becomes known.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2521"><sup>54</sup> See Ex. 14:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2522"><sup>55</sup> See notes on I.E. Ex. 3:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2523"><sup>56</sup> Hence the meaning of <italic>yam suf</italic> is the Sea of Flags or the Sea of Reeds.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2524"><sup>57</sup> This is Yefet&#x2019;s assumption.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2525"><sup>58</sup> Hence the meaning of <italic>yam suf</italic> is the Sea of Suf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2526"><sup>59</sup> Chinnereth was the name of a city. See Jud. 19:35. The area around the city was called the land of Chinnereth (I Kings 15:20). The sea adjacent to this area was called the Sea of Chinnereth. Similarly, the Talmud refers to it as the Sea of Tiberias (<italic>Megillah</italic> 6a) because the city of Tiberias is situated on it shores.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2527"><sup>60</sup> The bottom of the ocean floor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2528"><sup>61</sup> According to the rules of grammar the word should have read <italic>yekhasyumo.</italic> Compare, <italic>timla&#x2019;emo, torishemo</italic> (v. 9).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2529"><sup>62</sup> Wherein a <italic>shuruk</italic> has been substituted for a <italic>cholam,</italic> for the word should have read <italic>ta&#x2019;avori.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2530"><sup>63</sup> Translated according to I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2531"><sup>64</sup> It has no meaning. Scripture could have employed <italic>nedar</italic> as it does i n verse 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2532"><sup>65</sup> Which is superfluous. The word <italic>akhzari</italic> is found in Is. 13:9; Jer. 6:23; Prov. 11:17; and elsewhere in Scripture. Scripture uses the term <italic>akhzar</italic> in Deut. 32:33; Job 30:21; 41:2; and Lam. 4:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2533"><sup>66</sup> The line repeats itself in Ps. 92:10.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2537"><sup>70</sup> The reference is to the waters of the Jordan that split so that Israel could enter Canaan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2538"><sup>71</sup> Translated according to I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2539"><sup>72</sup> <italic>In the heart of the sea</italic> thus means in the midst of the sea.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2540"><sup>73</sup> Here. For the suffix <italic>mo</italic> in <italic>timla&#x2019;emo</italic> means them. Hence our verse literally reads, My soul will fill them (or satisfy them). However, this was not Pharaoh&#x2019;s intention. Pharaoh&#x2019;s intention was to be full of their wealth. Hence our text should have read: My soul will be full <span class="underline">of</span> them; i.e., I will be full of their wealth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2541"><sup>74</sup> <italic>Nafshi</italic> (my lust) may also be translated as, my person or my soul.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2542"><sup>75</sup> In other words, even though the suffix <italic>mo</italic> means them we can interpret it to mean from them or of them. We can thus interpret <italic>timla&#x2019;emo</italic> to mean full of them rather than will fill them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2543"><sup>76</sup> The suffix <italic>ni</italic> means me. Thus <italic>yetza&#x2019;uni</italic> literally means: gone forth me. However, this is not the meaning of the word in the context of the verse. Its meaning is, gone forth of me. We thus see that Scripture sometimes employs a direct object suffix with the meaning of an indirect object. The same is true of <italic>timla&#x2019;emo.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2544"><sup>77</sup> <italic>Timla&#x2019;emo nafshi.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2545"><sup>78</sup> In other words, I will be full of them means: I will be full of their spoils.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2546"><sup>79</sup> The root <italic>mem, lamed, alef</italic> doesn&#x2019;t only mean to fill. It also means to presume. In our verse it is used in the latter sense.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2547"><sup>80</sup> Thus <italic>timla&#x2019;emo</italic> means: will carry out my intentions. Hence <italic>timla&#x2019;emo nafshi</italic> means: I will carry out my intentions upon them or, according to J.P.S., <italic>my lust shall be satisfied upon them.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2548"><sup>81</sup> Satisfying his lust upon them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2549"><sup>82</sup> The root of <italic>torishemo</italic> is <italic>yod, resh, shin.</italic> This root also has the meaning of to inherit, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2550"><sup>83</sup> Translated according to I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2551"><sup>84</sup> Thus <italic>nashafta ve-ruchakha</italic> literally means: you &#x201C;nighted&#x201D; with a wind.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2552"><sup>85</sup> This comment presents a problem. If <italic>tzalelu</italic> is the verbal form of <italic>metzolot</italic> (depths) then its meaning is, they sank. This being the case, what connection is there between <italic>tzalelu</italic> in our verse and <italic>tzalelu</italic> in Hab. 3:16, which means quivered? Krinsky suggests reading <italic>metzilot</italic> (bells, cymbals) (Zech. 14:20) rather than <italic>metzolot</italic> (depths). Indeed, I.E. connects <italic>tzalelu</italic> in Hab. 3:16 to <italic>metziltayim</italic> (cymbals). According to Krinsky we should read, &#x201C;<italic>Tzalelu</italic> (they sank) comes from the same root as <italic>metzilot</italic> (bells, cymbals).&#x201D; In other words, <italic>tzalelu</italic> means they tingled, and the meaning of our verse is, they tingled like lead in the mighty waters; i.e., they cried and shrieked as they drowned as if they were lead cymbals. The point is, they did not die quietly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2553"><sup>86</sup> If we accept Krinsky&#x2019;s emendation then we should render, they tingled.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2554"><sup>87</sup> Its root being <italic>ayin, peh, resh.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2560"><sup>93</sup> The verse speaks of God bringing Israel to His holy habitation. It thus deals with the future. I.E. interprets <italic>Thou in thy love hast led</italic> as: Thou in thy love will lead.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2561"><sup>94</sup> For the prophet speaks of the future as if it already has come to pass. See I.E. on Gen. 48:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2562"><sup>95</sup> God, out of love for His people, caused the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire to lead Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2563"><sup>96</sup> This refers to I.E.&#x2019;s opening comment that Scripture uses a perfect in place of an imperfect. I.E. now suggests that the Pentateuch uses a perfect because it speaks of the past; i.e., up to this point God lovingly led Israel i n their march to His holy habitation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2564"><sup>97</sup> J.P.S. renders journey.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2565"><sup>98</sup> In other words, the root <italic>nun, heh, lamed</italic> means to lead.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2566"><sup>99</sup> On their journey to the promised land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2567"><sup>100</sup> In other words, Philistia is short for the land of Philistia. <italic>Peleshet</italic> (Philistia) is the name of a nation, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that here it refers to their country (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2568"><sup>101</sup> It indicates that Scripture speaks of a country.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2569"><sup>102</sup> As it is in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2570"><sup>103</sup> Or rams. Thus <italic>ele mo&#x2019;av</italic> (the mighty men of Moab) literally means the rams of Moab.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2572"><sup>105</sup> See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on verse 14.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2579"><sup>112</sup> I.E. had to take the trouble to say all of this, i.e., that the verse does not refer to the Canaanites even though they are the last nation mentioned in the previous verse, and then he had to offer other similar instances.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 16</title>
<p>1. AND THEY TOOK THEIR JOURNEY. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that the reason Scripture mentions <italic>the fifteenth day of the second month</italic> is to inform us that Israel left Egypt on the fifth day of the week.<sup><xref rid="fn2674">1</xref></sup> Now, the first day of Nisan fell on a Thursday<sup><xref rid="fn2675">2</xref></sup> and Iyyar on a Friday and on a Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn2676">3</xref></sup> Israel came to the wilderness of Sin<sup><xref rid="fn2677">4</xref></sup> on a Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn2678">5</xref></sup> and complained<sup><xref rid="fn2679">6</xref></sup> upon camping. Moses then told them that they would eat meat at even<sup><xref rid="fn2680">7</xref></sup> and that manna would come down in the morning.<sup><xref rid="fn2681">8</xref></sup> Now it is logical to assume that the manna first came down on a Sunday because Scripture states, <italic>And it shall come to pass on the sixth day</italic> (v. 5), the reference being to the sixth day of the week and the sixth day from the day on which the manna began to descend.<sup><xref rid="fn2682">9</xref></sup> We will accept that which the Gaon says because of tradition,<sup><xref rid="fn2683">10</xref></sup> not because of his explanation, for who told the Gaon that the manna came down on the morning following the coming of the Israelites to the wilderness of Sin?<sup><xref rid="fn2684">11</xref></sup> The Israelites may have camped there for four or more days<sup><xref rid="fn2685">12</xref></sup> but the manna started to come down on Sunday. The latter is so because we start the count<sup><xref rid="fn2686">13</xref></sup> from the day that the manna began to fall,<sup><xref rid="fn2687">14</xref></sup> for all the nations rely on Israel with regard to this numeration.<sup><xref rid="fn2688">15</xref></sup> Observe, the Christians named the days of the week after the stars.<sup><xref rid="fn2689">16</xref></sup> However, they did not do the same with the Sabbath day. The first five days of the week in Arabic are numbered. The sixth day is called <italic>al juma</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2690">17</xref></sup> because it is the most honored day of the week for the Arabs and they congregate on this day. The Arabs refer to the day of <italic>shabbat</italic> as <italic>sabbat</italic> because the <italic>shin</italic> and <italic>samekh</italic> interchange in their script. They learned this<sup><xref rid="fn2691">18</xref></sup> from the Israelites. Behold, the natives of India, who do not have the belief of six days of creation, begin the week on Wednesday because the sun is the star of that day and according to their beliefs it rules over them.</p>
<p>2. AND THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MURMURED. The Israelites murmured only against Moses at the waters of Marah (Ex. 15:23)<sup><xref rid="fn2692">19</xref></sup> because it was he alone who led Israel onward.<sup><xref rid="fn2693">20</xref></sup> Only a part of Israel and not the whole nation complained.<sup><xref rid="fn2694">21</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads, <italic>And the people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2695">22</xref></sup> <italic>murmured against Moses</italic> (Ex. 15:24). However, in the wilderness of Sin we find that Scripture states, <italic>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron</italic> because both of them had brought them out of the land of Egypt. In Marah they complained because of the water. However, they now complained about a lack of bread and meat because they had already consumed most of their cattle, for thirty days had passed since they left Egypt. A congregation as large as Israel could only buy food at very great expense.<sup><xref rid="fn2696">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. BEHOLD, I WILL CAUSE TO RAIN BREAD FROM HEAVEN. The bread will come down like rain from the sky.</p>
<p>[BREAD.] The word <italic>lechem</italic> (bread) means food. It is found used for bread itself and also for meat, as in <italic>lechem isheh</italic> (food of the offering made by fire) (Lev. 3:11). It is also used for fruit, as in <italic>Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof</italic> (be-lachmo) (Jer. 11:19).</p>
<p>[THAT I MAY PROVE THEM.] For they will daily need Me.</p>
<p>5. [TWICE.] The meaning of <italic>mishneh</italic> (twice) is two <italic>omers</italic> per person, for it is so written.<sup><xref rid="fn2697">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND MOSES AND AARON SAID. Moses and Aaron said, <italic>then shall ye know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt</italic> because the Israelites charged, <italic>for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness</italic> (v. 3). They answered, &#x201C;Observe, we will perform two signs for you, one at the evening of this very day<sup><xref rid="fn2698">25</xref></sup> and one on the morning of the morrow<sup><xref rid="fn2699">26</xref></sup> so that you will know that <italic>the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt</italic>.&#x201D; Scripture should have read: at even and in the morning ye shall know<sup><xref rid="fn2700">27</xref></sup> because <italic>and in the morning</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2701">28</xref></sup> is not connected to <italic>then ye shall see the glory of the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2702">29</xref></sup> For as Scripture goes on to say,<sup><xref rid="fn2703">30</xref></sup> Israel saw God&#x2019;s glory on that very day.</p>
<p>7. AND IN THE MORNING. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn2704">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR THAT HE HATH HEARD YOUR MURMURINGS. This is connected to <italic>then ye shall see the glory of the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2705">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WHAT ARE WE. What can we do? We only did what we were commanded to do. The word <italic>ve-nachnu</italic> (and we) is missing an <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2706">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND MOSES SAID. Moses now told them what the two signs<sup><xref rid="fn2707">34</xref></sup> would consist of.</p>
<p>9. COME NEAR BEFORE THE LORD. Turn<sup><xref rid="fn2708">35</xref></sup> to the wilderness.<sup><xref rid="fn2709">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND IT CAME TO PASS. It became clear to them that when Aaron spoke to them, they came near before the Lord. The cloud came immediately and God&#x2019;s glory was seen in it.</p>
<p>11. AND THE LORD SPOKE. The Israelites saw that Moses went to the glory of the Lord and spoke to God.</p>
<p>12. I HAVE HEARD. The word <italic>telunnot</italic> is irregular in that its <italic>nun</italic> has a <italic>dagesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2710">37</xref></sup> This prophecy<sup><xref rid="fn2711">38</xref></sup> is repeated.<sup><xref rid="fn2712">39</xref></sup> Scripture had already noted,<sup><xref rid="fn2713">40</xref></sup> <italic>the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full.</italic> It was only repeated<sup><xref rid="fn2714">41</xref></sup> so that Israel would see the glory of the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn2715">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AT DUSK.] The term <italic>ben ha-arbayim</italic> means, as I have already explained, at dusk.<sup><xref rid="fn2716">43</xref></sup> This verse proves my interpretation of <italic>and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of God.</italic> (v. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn2717">44</xref></sup> For the verse states, <italic>At dusk ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2718">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND IT CAME TO PASS AT EVEN. At the end of that very day.</p>
<p>THAT THE QUAILS CAME UP. Possibly from the direction of the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2719">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>A LAYER OF DEW. <italic>Shikhvat</italic> (a layer) is similar to <italic>yashkiv</italic> (bring down) in <italic>Or who can bring down</italic> (yashkiv) <italic>the bottles of heaven</italic> (Job 38:37).<sup><xref rid="fn2720">47</xref></sup> It means a descent.<sup><xref rid="fn2721">48</xref></sup> Scripture elsewhere writes, <italic>u-veredet ha-tal</italic> (And when the dew descended)<sup><xref rid="fn2722">49</xref></sup> (Num. 11:9).</p>
<p>May the name of Chivi<sup><xref rid="fn2723">50</xref></sup> rot for saying that the manna is to be identified with what is known in the Persian tongue as <italic>tarnagbin,</italic> in Arabic as <italic>man,</italic> and in the vernacular as manna. There are many questions raised against him. First of all, no manna falls today in the wilderness of Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn2724">51</xref></sup> for we know the location of the mountain.<sup><xref rid="fn2725">52</xref></sup> Now I have seen that which resembles manna in the kingdom of Al tzakir,<sup><xref rid="fn2726">53</xref></sup> and it only comes down in Nisan and Iyyar and in no other months.<sup><xref rid="fn2727">54</xref></sup> Additionally, if you place it in the sun it does not melt.<sup><xref rid="fn2728">55</xref></sup> Furthermore, it does not rot in the evening.<sup><xref rid="fn2729">56</xref></sup> Moreover, it is not very hard and one does not have to grind it in a pestle<sup><xref rid="fn2730">57</xref></sup> if one wants to make cakes out of it. Furthermore, it melts when placed upon the tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn2731">58</xref></sup> In addition, it does not satisfy<sup><xref rid="fn2732">59</xref></sup> because it does not produce good blood. It is only used as a medical ingredient.<sup><xref rid="fn2733">60</xref></sup> Furthermore, a double portion of manna came down on Friday.<sup><xref rid="fn2734">61</xref></sup> Moreover, the manna did not come down on the Sabbath. Furthermore, the manna came down wherever Israel camped.<sup><xref rid="fn2735">62</xref></sup> In addition, the manna crossed over the Jordan with the Israelites and did not cease to descend, according to the plain meaning of Scripture, until half the month of Nisan,<sup><xref rid="fn2736">63</xref></sup> had passed.</p>
<p>14. AND WHEN THE LAYER OF DEW WAS GONE UP. The meaning of <italic>va-ta&#x2019;al</italic> (was gone up)<sup><xref rid="fn2737">64</xref></sup> is ceased.<sup><xref rid="fn2738">65</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>alah</italic> (went up) in <italic>Then defiledst thou it</italic> &#x2014; <italic>my couch went up</italic> (alah) (Gen. 49:4).<sup><xref rid="fn2739">66</xref></sup> The meaning of the latter verse is: from the time that you defiled my couch it was removed from me and ceased to function.<sup><xref rid="fn2740">67</xref></sup> <italic>Ta&#x2019;aleni</italic> (take me away)<sup><xref rid="fn2741">68</xref></sup> in <italic>O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days</italic> (Ps. 102:25) is similar.</p>
<p>The dew came down first to clean the earth. When the dew was gone the manna descended. The latter<sup><xref rid="fn2742">69</xref></sup> is clearly written,<sup><xref rid="fn2743">70</xref></sup> viz., <italic>And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it</italic> (Num. 11:9).</p>
<p>A FINE, SCALE-LIKE THING. <italic>Mechuspas</italic> (scale-like thing) means round shaped. It has no cognate.<sup><xref rid="fn2744">71</xref></sup> The one who says<sup><xref rid="fn2745">72</xref></sup> that <italic>mechuspas</italic> is similar to <italic>machsof</italic> (uncovering) (Gen. 30:37),<sup><xref rid="fn2746">73</xref></sup> which is spelled with a <italic>sin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2747">74</xref></sup> is incorrect. For it is the manner of Hebrew to double the first and second root letters,<sup><xref rid="fn2748">75</xref></sup> as in the word <italic>yafyafita</italic> (thou art fairer)<sup><xref rid="fn2749">76</xref></sup> (Ps. 45:3), or to double the second and third stem letters, as in the word <italic>yerakrak</italic> (greenish)<sup><xref rid="fn2750">77</xref></sup> (Lev. 13:49), or to double only the third stem letter, as in <italic>sagrir</italic> (a very rainy day)<sup><xref rid="fn2751">78</xref></sup> (Prov. 27:15). However, we never find the second root letter<sup><xref rid="fn2752">79</xref></sup> doubled<sup><xref rid="fn2753">80</xref></sup> except for instances when the <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2754">81</xref></sup> is silent, as in <italic>hagigi</italic> (my meditation)<sup><xref rid="fn2755">82</xref></sup> (Ps. 5:2) in which the <italic>gimel</italic> appears to be a third root letter after the <italic>heh</italic> is dropped.<sup><xref rid="fn2756">83</xref></sup> Hence it was doubled. However, we do not find the middle root letters to be doubled in words where all root letters are sounded.<sup><xref rid="fn2757">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WHEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SAW IT. Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn2758">85</xref></sup> says that the meaning of <italic>man hu</italic> (what is it) in Arabic is, <italic>what is it</italic>? However, someone misinformed him, because the Arabic phrase for &#x201C;what is it&#x201D; is <italic>mah huwi,</italic> as the term <italic>man</italic> is used in Arabic exclusively in reference to people. The way to explain <italic>man</italic> is to note that it comes from the same root as <italic>minnah</italic> (appointed) in <italic>who hath appointed your food and your drink</italic> (Dan. 1:10).<sup><xref rid="fn2759">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND MOSES SAID UNTO THEM.] Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that we know that the Torah is not written in chronological order. Thus the meaning of <italic>And Moses said unto them</italic> is: and Moses had previously said unto them.<sup><xref rid="fn2760">87</xref></sup> There are many similar instances.<sup><xref rid="fn2761">88</xref></sup> Indeed, we find that Scripture states in this very portion, <italic>and it bred worms and rotted,</italic> the meaning of which is: and it bred worms and had previously rotted.<sup><xref rid="fn2762">89</xref></sup> Indeed, Scripture states, <italic>and it did not rot, neither was there any worm in it</italic> (v. 24).<sup><xref rid="fn2763">90</xref></sup> Scripture delayed reporting the words of Moses<sup><xref rid="fn2764">91</xref></sup> because it had to elaborate and go on to say, <italic>This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded,</italic> etc. (v. 16).<sup><xref rid="fn2765">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>[GATHER YE OF IT EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS EATING.] This was to be done by logical estimate.<sup><xref rid="fn2766">93</xref></sup> <italic>An omer for a head</italic> was for someone fully grown, for minors gather according to how much they consume.<sup><xref rid="fn2767">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID SO. According to the plain meaning of the text some gathered more and some less according to the number of people in their tents. However, our sages said that our verse speaks of a miracle.<sup><xref rid="fn2768">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND WHEN THEY DID METE IT WITH AN OMER. Each one found that he had the amount that he had estimated.<sup><xref rid="fn2769">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND MOSES SAID UNTO THEM: LET NO MAN LEAVE OF IT TILL THE MORNING. Its meaning is, do not leave some of the manna over to eat on the next morning. Rather, trust in the Lord that it will descend on the following day. There was no command to eat the entire omer.<sup><xref rid="fn2770">97</xref></sup> However, that which a person did not consume was to be thrown outside of his tent.</p>
<p>20. NOTWITHSTANDING THEY HEARKENED NOT UNTO MOSES. The word <italic>anashim</italic> (some of them) is connected to <italic>Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2771">98</xref></sup> They were few in number.<sup><xref rid="fn2772">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Merinus<sup><xref rid="fn2773">100</xref></sup> says that <italic>va-yarum</italic> (and it bred worms) comes from the same root as <italic>rimmah</italic> (worms).<sup><xref rid="fn2774">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THEY GATHERED IT MORNING BY MORNING. The meaning of <italic>ve-cham ha-shemesh</italic> (and as the sun waxed hot) is: and when the day waxed hot. For the sun does not wax hot.</p>
<p>IT MELTED. <italic>Namas</italic> (melted) comes from a double root<sup><xref rid="fn2775">102</xref></sup> and is in the <italic>nifal.</italic></p>
<p>22. AND IT CAME TO PASS. More than the usual amount of manna descended on this day, as Scripture goes on to note. Israel gathered twice as much food on this day because Moses had commanded them to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn2776">103</xref></sup> However, they did not know why.<sup><xref rid="fn2777">104</xref></sup> Also,<sup><xref rid="fn2778">105</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>they gathered,</italic> not they found.<sup><xref rid="fn2779">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rulers of the congregation came and told Moses that Israel did as he commanded them. They then asked Moses: What should be done with the extra portion? Why did he command them to gather twice as much food?<sup><xref rid="fn2780">107</xref></sup> How could they consume such a large amount of food?</p>
<p>23. AND HE SAID UNTO THEM. God has already told me that you are obligated to rest tomorrow and not do any work including the preparation of food,<sup><xref rid="fn2781">108</xref></sup> for tomorrow is a Sabbath day unto the Lord. This is God&#x2019;s day<sup><xref rid="fn2782">109</xref></sup> because He rested from all His work on the seventh day. We find the same with regard to the Sabbatical year, viz., <italic>then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the Lord</italic> (Lev. 25:2).</p>
<p>[SABBATH.] The word <italic>shabbat</italic> is grammatically difficult. It does not belong in the paradigm of <italic>gannav</italic> (thief)<sup><xref rid="fn2783">110</xref></sup> because the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>shabbat</italic> is a feminine suffix,<sup><xref rid="fn2784">111</xref></sup> as is proven by the phrase <italic>shabbat hi la-Adonai</italic> (it is a sabbath unto the Lord) (Lev. 23:3).<sup><xref rid="fn2785">112</xref></sup> The word <italic>shabbat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2786">113</xref></sup> is a noun meaning cessation.<sup><xref rid="fn2787">114</xref></sup> The following is its grammatical explanation. The word should have been spelled and vocalized <italic>shabbetet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2788">115</xref></sup> according to the paradigm of <italic>dalleket</italic> (inflammation) (Deut. 28:22). When one of the <italic>tavs</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2789">116</xref></sup> was dropped the <italic>bet</italic> was vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2790">117</xref></sup> to indicate that the word is feminine. It is the same, as I will explain, with the word <italic>achat</italic> (one).<sup><xref rid="fn2791">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BAKE.] The word <italic>efu</italic> (bake) is irregular. It should have followed the paradigm of <italic>asu</italic> (do).<sup><xref rid="fn2792">119</xref></sup> Behold, Moses told the rulers of the congregation<sup><xref rid="fn2793">120</xref></sup> what they should do.<sup><xref rid="fn2794">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>BAKE THAT WHICH YE WILL BAKE. Bake as you normally do so that you will have what to eat on this day. <italic>And see the that which ye will seethe</italic> has a similar meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn2795">122</xref></sup> Behold, prepare and cook all this according to your heart&#x2019;s desire from one omer and eat as much as you need.<sup><xref rid="fn2796">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ALL THAT REMAINETH. Lay it up till the morning and I will tell you what to do.<sup><xref rid="fn2797">124</xref></sup> Now Moses did not inform them that no manna would descend on the Sabbath day. It was only in the morning that he revealed this secret to them</p>
<p>25. AND MOSES SAID. Many lacking in faith erred because of this verse and said that a person is obligated to keep the Sabbath day plus the night which follows it,<sup><xref rid="fn2798">125</xref></sup> because Moses said, <italic>for to-day</italic> and not the night before <italic>is a sabbath unto the Lord.</italic> Additionally, Moses said, <italic>Tomorrow is a solemn rest</italic> (v. 23).<sup><xref rid="fn2799">126</xref></sup> They interpreted, in accordance with their view, <italic>And there was evening and there was morning one day</italic> (Gen. 1:5) to mean that the first day was not finished until the morning of the second day.<sup><xref rid="fn2800">127</xref></sup> However, they spoke incorrectly. As I have already made mention to you, Moses spoke to Israel only in accordance with their practice. Now the manner of the land of the uncircumcised<sup><xref rid="fn2801">128</xref></sup> with regard to their food, their dress, their buildings, and affairs is not the same as that of the Land of Israel. It is the practice in the Land of Israel that no one bakes, cooks, or does any other work, both in summer or winter, at any time but during the day.<sup><xref rid="fn2802">129</xref></sup> Hence Moses said, <italic>Tomorrow is a solemn rest</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2803">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now pay close attention to understand the stupidity of those who explain <italic>and there was evening and there was morning</italic> in the manner which I noted above. For Scripture says, <italic>And God called the light day</italic> (Gen. 1:8), the reference being from the time that the sun rises until the time that it sets; <italic>and to the darkness He called night,</italic> the reference being from the time that the sun sets until the time that it rises. The night is thus the opposite of day, as the darkness is the opposite of the light. This being the case, how can Scripture refer to the evening, which commences at the time that the sun sets and lasts until the morning, as &#x201C;day&#x201D; when it is then night? Behold, concerning such people Scripture states, <italic>They change the night into day</italic> (Job 17:12).</p>
<p>Now note that the word day is used in Hebrew in two ways. I have already mentioned one of them, viz., as long as the light of the sun is over any place on the earth. Therefore Scripture states, <italic>three days, night and day</italic> (Esth. 4:16) and, <italic>and night and day</italic> (Gen. 8:22). Now if the measure of the day includes the night in it, why mention night?<sup><xref rid="fn2804">131</xref></sup> It is also incorrect from the point of view of the science of linguistics<sup><xref rid="fn2805">132</xref></sup> for a noun to refer to two things which are the opposite of each other.<sup><xref rid="fn2806">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word day is used secondarily in the sense of close or far-off time, as in <italic>on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt</italic> (Num. 3:13); <italic>thou art to pass over the Jordan this day</italic> (Deut. 9:1); <italic>and cast them into another land, as it is this day</italic> (Deut. 29:27); <italic>And it shall come to pass in that day</italic> (Is. 7:21). There are many other similar instances.</p>
<p>Now let us leave all these things aside and seek, as I have said, only after the day of the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn2807">134</xref></sup> for our years are not established according to the movement of the sun and moon but rather according to what the Bet Din decrees.<sup><xref rid="fn2808">135</xref></sup> Now we find that Scripture states, <italic>Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread</italic> (Ex. 12:15). Scripture then goes on to explain that this number<sup><xref rid="fn2809">136</xref></sup> begins on the evening of the fourteenth of the first month (Ex. 12:18). Scripture also states, <italic>from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath</italic> (Lev. 23:32).<sup><xref rid="fn2810">137</xref></sup> Furthermore, a man who has a seminal emission during the night or day, for it is so written, viz., <italic>that which chanceth him by night</italic> (Deut. 23:11), does not become &#x201C;clean&#x201D; until sunset, which is the end of the first day.<sup><xref rid="fn2811">138</xref></sup> Now if it were so,<sup><xref rid="fn2812">139</xref></sup> namely, that the first day ends on the morning of the next day,<sup><xref rid="fn2813">140</xref></sup> then it is only fit for the one who experienced an emission to immerse himself in the morning.<sup><xref rid="fn2814">141</xref></sup> For if we say that the day and the night which follows it make up one day then the one who experienced an emission<sup><xref rid="fn2815">142</xref></sup> will be &#x201C;unclean&#x201D; for half a day<sup><xref rid="fn2816">143</xref></sup> and clean for half a day.<sup><xref rid="fn2817">144</xref></sup> And one who experienced an emission at the beginning of the night will be unclean for half of a day that passed<sup><xref rid="fn2818">145</xref></sup> and also for half of the coming day.<sup><xref rid="fn2819">146</xref></sup> This is the opinion of those who err.<sup><xref rid="fn2820">147</xref></sup> I have already explained to you the meaning of <italic>and there was evening and there was morning</italic> (Gen. 1:5) in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn2821">148</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND MOSES SAID. Moses now explained to them what they should do with the additional manna which was laid up, and he revealed to them its secret, that they would not find it this day because it did not come down.</p>
<p>26. SIX DAYS SHALL YE GATHER IT. It shall always be as it is now for as long as you are in the wilderness; that is, ye shall gather it for six days but on the seventh no manna shall come down.</p>
<p>[IN IT THERE SHALL BE NONE.] The word <italic>bo</italic> (in it) is added for additional clarification. It is similar to <italic>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it</italic> (Gen. 2:17).<sup><xref rid="fn2822">149</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE SEVENTH DAY. Of the manna&#x2019;s appearance.<sup><xref rid="fn2823">150</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT THERE WENT OUT&#x2026;TO GATHER. To see whether Moses&#x2019; words would stand up.</p>
<p>28. AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES. Moses was Israel&#x2019;s representative.<sup><xref rid="fn2824">151</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: the Lord said unto Moses, tell the following to the Israelites.</p>
<p>[MY COMMANDMENTS.] This was said in reference to the people who left some of the manna over until the morning.<sup><xref rid="fn2825">152</xref></sup></p>
<p>[MY LAWS.]<sup><xref rid="fn2826">153</xref></sup> For God taught them the reason for the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn2827">154</xref></sup> They therefore gathered twice as much bread on the sixth day.</p>
<p>There is a reason why Scripture employs the plural, namely, <italic>My commandments and My laws</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2828">155</xref></sup> All the commandments and laws are, beyond any doubt, to be taken literally. However, they have secret meanings pertaining to the soul that only the enlightened can understand. Thus every commandment has two meanings.<sup><xref rid="fn2829">156</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. SEE. Its meaning is: see the wonder that the Lord will perform for you so that it shall become clear to you that God commanded you to rest as He rested when He made all things in the beginning. God is therefore permitting twice as much manna to come down today as normally comes down every day.</p>
<p>ABIDE YE EVERY MAN IN HIS PLACE. In one&#x2019;s tent.</p>
<p>[LET NO MAN GO OUT OF HIS PLACE.] It meaning is: let no man go out of his place on the seventh day to gather manna as the men who went out to gather did.<sup><xref rid="fn2830">157</xref></sup></p>
<p>[30.] SO THE PEOPLE RESTED. Scripture tells us that from that day on, no man went out on the Sabbath to gather.<sup><xref rid="fn2831">158</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL CALLED THE NAME THEREOF MANNA. Behold, Scripture previously noted the miracles associated with the manna.<sup><xref rid="fn2832">159</xref></sup> It now turns to relate its praises.</p>
<p>[AND IT WAS LIKE CORIANDER SEED, WHITE.] Some say that <italic>gad</italic> (coriander) refers to <italic>kosbarta,</italic> in Arabic, <italic>kusbar.</italic> Others say that it means mustard. However, I do not know, as it is not found in any other context save in reference to the manna. The same is the case with the word <italic>tzappichat</italic> (wafers), which Saadiah Gaon says means an unleavened wafer. Now when the manna was eaten as it was when it came down, it had the taste of a wafer made with honey. However, when cooked it had the taste of a cake baked in oil (Num. 11:8). Scripture mentions these two delicacies.<sup><xref rid="fn2833">160</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. AND MOSES SAID. This chapter should have followed the account of the construction of the Tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn2834">161</xref></sup> It was placed here to relate the miracle of the manna<sup><xref rid="fn2835">162</xref></sup> lasting for generations.<sup><xref rid="fn2836">163</xref></sup> Now Moses told this to Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2837">164</xref></sup> He therefore said, <italic>wherewith I fed you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2838">165</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. A JAR. A clay or copper utensil. The word is not found elsewhere.</p>
<p>[BEFORE THE LORD.] Its meaning is, before the divine glory which is upon the cherubim.</p>
<p>34. AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES. Scripture here explains that <italic>before the Lord</italic> means: <italic>before the Testimony,</italic> the reference being to the ark. The ark is referred to as the Ark of the Testimony because of the tablets of the covenant<sup><xref rid="fn2839">166</xref></sup> that were in it.</p>
<p>35. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. This miracle<sup><xref rid="fn2840">167</xref></sup> was greater than all the other miracles that were done via Moses, for many miracles were connected with the manna. These miracles, unlike all other wonders, lasted for forty years.</p>
<p>[UNTIL THEY CAME TO A LAND INHABITED.] Scripture says this for they were in the wilderness, <italic>in a land that no man passed through</italic> (Jer. 2:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2841">168</xref></sup> Now once Israel crossed the Jordan they ate the grain that they found there.<sup><xref rid="fn2842">169</xref></sup> The reason Scripture found it necessary to say, <italic>they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan</italic> is that the manna accompanied them until they came to Gilgal,<sup><xref rid="fn2843">170</xref></sup> which lies on the border of the land of Canaan. The manna then ceased to fall, for now they had new grain.</p>
<p>36. NOW AN OMER IS THE TENTH PART OF AN EPHAH. Scripture mentions this measurement because one omer per person was sufficient for satiation.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2674"><sup>1</sup> Saadiah&#x2019;s reasoning is explained in what follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2675"><sup>2</sup> If we assume that Israel left Egypt on a Thursday then the first day of Nisan had to fall on a Thursday, as Israel left Egypt on the 15th of Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2676"><sup>3</sup> <italic>Rosh Chodesh</italic> (new moon) Iyyar fell on Friday and Saturday, as it does whenever the 15th of Nisan falls on a Thursday. Friday was the 30th of Nisan and Saturday the first day of Iyyar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2677"><sup>4</sup> On the 15th day of the second month (v. 1).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2678"><sup>5</sup> For the manna started to fall on a Sunday (see further in I.E.&#x2019;s comment on this verse). Saadiah Gaon assumes that the manna began to fall on the day following Israel&#x2019;s arrival in the wilderness of Sin. This is crucial for the establishment of Thursday as the day of the Exodus. For if the 15th of Iyyar fell on a Saturday, then the 15th of Nisan had to fall on a Thursday. Incidentally, this last happened in 1989.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2679"><sup>6</sup> That they were starving (v. 3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2680"><sup>7</sup> Of that day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2681"><sup>8</sup> That is, on the following morning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2682"><sup>9</sup> When Scripture says, <italic>and it shall come to pass on the sixth day</italic> (v. 5) it means: and it shall come to pass on the sixth day from the day that the manna begins to fall. For after creation, with the exception of the Sabbath, Scripture does not refer to days of the week (Filwarg). It so happened that the sixth day fell on a Friday (see v. 23).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2683"><sup>10</sup> According to Talmudic tradition the Israelites left Egypt on a Thursday. See <italic>Sabbath</italic> 87b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2684"><sup>11</sup> Nowhere does Scripture say this.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2685"><sup>12</sup> Scripture does not state that the Israelites started to complain that they lacked food immediately upon arriving in Sin. The Israelites could have come to Sin on a day other than the Sabbath. They could have stayed there a few days and then started to complain on a Sabbath about a lack of food. There is thus no proof that the 15th of Iyyar fell on a Saturday. Hence there is no proof that the Exodus took place on a Thursday.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2686"><sup>13</sup> In order to get the number six mentioned in verses 5 and 22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2687"><sup>14</sup> Thus if the sixth day from the start of the manna falling was a Friday (v. 22), the first day was a Sunday.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2688"><sup>15</sup> That the week ends on the Sabbath and the days are numbered from it. There can thus be no doubt that the manna started to fall on a Sunday.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2689"><sup>16</sup> Sunday, Monday, and the like.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2690"><sup>17</sup> The day of gathering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2691"><sup>18</sup> That the week ends with the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2692"><sup>19</sup> In contrast to Sin, where they murmured against Moses and Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2693"><sup>20</sup> From the Red Sea to Marah. See Ex. 15:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2694"><sup>21</sup> At Marah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2695"><sup>22</sup> That is, some of the people murmured. However, here at Sin all the people murmured.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2696"><sup>23</sup> From the surrounding nations. For demand drove the price up. Hence they complained against Moses and Aaron.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2740"><sup>67</sup> Thus Gen. 49:4 should be translated: Then defildedst thou it &#x2014; my couch was removed. Cf. I.E. on Gen. 49:4.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2744"><sup>71</sup> The word is not found again in Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2745"><sup>72</sup> Rashi, interpreting Onkelos. According to Rashi <italic>mechuspas</italic> means uncovered; that is, the manna was similar to a peeled seed (Ralbag).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2746"><sup>73</sup> Translated according to I.E. and Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2747"><sup>74</sup> Whereas <italic>mechuspas</italic> is spelled with a <italic>samekh.</italic> However, the latter presents no problem, for the <italic>sin</italic> and the <italic>samekh</italic> interchange.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2750"><sup>77</sup> From the root <italic>yod, resh, kof.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2751"><sup>78</sup> From the root <italic>samekh, gimel, resh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2752"><sup>79</sup> That is, only the second root letter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2753"><sup>80</sup> As it would be if <italic>mechuspas</italic> came from the same root as <italic>machsof,</italic> for the root of <italic>machsof</italic> is <italic>chet, sin, feh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2754"><sup>81</sup> That is, in words that end in <italic>heh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2755"><sup>82</sup> From the root <italic>heh, gimel, heh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2756"><sup>83</sup> When we look at the word <italic>hagigi</italic> it appears to come from the root <italic>heh, gimel, gimel,</italic> not <italic>heh, gimel, heh</italic> with the <italic>gimel</italic> doubled.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2757"><sup>84</sup> As they are in the root <italic>chet, sin, peh.</italic> Hence <italic>mechuspas</italic> cannot be derived from that root.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2758"><sup>85</sup> Rashi. However, this comment is not found in Rashi but in Rashbam. I.E. most probably quoted from memory and erred. Krinsky cites an opinion that I.E. had an early edition of Rashi which had this interpretation and that Rashi later changed his mind and omitted it from subsequent editions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2759"><sup>86</sup> Thus <italic>man hu</italic> means: it is something appointed (for us); it is a food allotment set aside for us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2760"><sup>87</sup> If Moses had not first said, <italic>this is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat,</italic> Israel would not have known that the substance on the ground was their food allotment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2761"><sup>88</sup> Where the <italic>vav</italic> introduces a pluperfect. See I.E. on Gen. 1:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2762"><sup>89</sup> According to I.E. if it had not rotted first it would not have bred worms. The sequence of events thus was: it rotted and as a result bred worms.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2763"><sup>90</sup> We thus see that rotting precedes the breeding of worms.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2764"><sup>91</sup> That is, <italic>it is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat</italic> is out of sequence. See note 87.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2765"><sup>92</sup> In other words, Scripture wanted to present all the words that Moses spoke at that time in one unit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2766"><sup>93</sup> <italic>Every man according to his eating</italic> implies that one is to estimate how much the person for whom one is gathering will eat. I.E. says that this part of the verse refers to minors.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2767"><sup>94</sup> That is, <italic>every man according to his eating.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2768"><sup>95</sup> Some gathered more and some gathered less. Nevertheless, when they came home and measured what they had gathered they found that they had gathered an omer per person. <italic>Yoma</italic> 75a. Also Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2769"><sup>96</sup> When they gathered the manna they did not use a measure but collected by estimation. When they came home they measured the amount gathered and it came to an omer per head. In common with the other commentaries, such as Rashi and Rashbam, I.E. explains that verse 17 describes what Israel did in the field, and verse 18 what they found to be the case at home, hence his interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2770"><sup>97</sup> <italic>Let no man leave of it till the morning</italic> could conceivably be interpreted as a command to consume the entire omer, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2771"><sup>98</sup> Our verse is to be interpreted as if written: Notwithstanding, some of them hearkened not unto Moses but left of it until morning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2772"><sup>99</sup> That is, those who did not hearken unto Moses. Hence <italic>ve-lo shame&#x2019;u</italic> (they hearkened not) does not refer to <italic>alehem</italic> (unto them) in the previous verse, which refers to all of Israel, but rather to <italic>anashim</italic> (some of them) which follows (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2773"><sup>100</sup> See notes on Ex. 1:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2774"><sup>101</sup> From the root <italic>resh, mem, mem.</italic> Hence <italic>va-yarum</italic> literally means: and it wormed; i.e., it bred worms.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2775"><sup>102</sup> <italic>Mem, samekh, samekh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2776"><sup>103</sup> Not because they happened to find twice as much on the ground.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2777"><sup>104</sup> Moses commanded them to gather twice as much manna on this day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2778"><sup>105</sup> Aside from merely assuming that Israel gathered twice as much manna because Moses told them to, we have an indication from Scripture that this indeed was the case.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2779"><sup>106</sup> Which shows that they deliberately gathered twice as much. They would only do so at the command of Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2780"><sup>107</sup> On this day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2781"><sup>108</sup> Hence you are to gather a double portion of manna on the sixth day.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2785"><sup>112</sup> <italic>Hi</italic> (it; literally, she) is a feminine pronoun. Hence the word <italic>shabbat</italic> must be feminine.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2797"><sup>124</sup> With the second omer. I.E. held that the Israelites ate the second omer uncooked.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2798"><sup>125</sup> Not the night before, as it is according to normative <italic>halakha.</italic> I.E. composed his <italic>Sefer Ha-Shabbat</italic> to refute this view. See Introduction to Vol. 1, p. XIX.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2803"><sup>130</sup> He did not say, &#x201C;This evening is a solemn rest,&#x201D; because people in any case did not do any work in the evening. However, if the Torah had been written in Europe Moses would have said, &#x201C;This evening is a solemn rest.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2804"><sup>131</sup> In Esth. 4:16 and Gen. 8:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2805"><sup>132</sup> Aside from the Biblical texts we have additional proof from linguistics that day cannot refer to nighttime.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2806"><sup>133</sup> Hence day cannot refer to nighttime.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2807"><sup>134</sup> That is, accept the fact that day begins at sunrise and ends at sunset.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2808"><sup>135</sup> Whereas each individual can establish when it is day by observing when the sun rises and sets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2809"><sup>136</sup> Of days, i.e., the seven days when unleavened bread is to be eaten. This shows, contra the sectarians, that the evening is connected to the day that follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2810"><sup>137</sup> The Day of Atonement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2811"><sup>138</sup> Following the emission or the day on which the emission occurred.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2812"><sup>139</sup> As the sectarians maintain, that the night following the day is considered part of the previous day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2813"><sup>140</sup> Following a seminal emission.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2814"><sup>141</sup> Following an emission.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2817"><sup>144</sup> From evening till the next morning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2818"><sup>145</sup> For the night belongs to the previous day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2819"><sup>146</sup> For he immerses himself the following evening.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2820"><sup>147</sup> As noted, however, it is illogical.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2821"><sup>148</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 1:5. There he explains <italic>and there was evening and there was morning</italic> not as meaning that the day came to a close at morning, but rather as meaning that the evening and the morning of the first day came.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2822"><sup>149</sup> <italic>Of it</italic> is inserted for clarification. See I.E. on Gen. 2:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2823"><sup>150</sup> For the manna started to come down on a Sunday. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verse 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2824"><sup>151</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the words <italic>How long refuse ye to keep My commandments,</italic> etc., although spoken to Moses, were directed at Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2825"><sup>152</sup> Verse 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2826"><sup>153</sup> Hebrew, <italic>torotai.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2827"><sup>154</sup> I.E. explains <italic>torotai</italic> to mean my teachings, that is, my teachings concerning the Sabbath, namely, that it is God&#x2019;s day and manna would not fall on it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2828"><sup>155</sup> When in reality one command and one teaching were violated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2829"><sup>156</sup> Thus when one violates a commandment one disregards its obvious meaning plus its secret meaning, hence the use of the plural commandments and laws in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2830"><sup>157</sup> Contra the Karaites, who took this verse to mean that one is not permitted to leave one&#x2019;s house on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2831"><sup>158</sup> Manna.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2832"><sup>159</sup> Ex. 16:15-30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2833"><sup>160</sup> However, when prepared in other ways it had other tastes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2834"><sup>161</sup> Our verse states, <italic>and lay it</italic> (the jar of manna) <italic>up before the Lord.</italic> This implies that the Tabernacle was in existence, as <italic>before the Lord</italic> means before the ark (v. 33). Hence the command to set aside a jar of manna was not given when the manna stated to fall but later, after the construction of the Tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2835"><sup>162</sup> That was placed in the jar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2836"><sup>163</sup> Since Scripture here mentions the miracle associated with the manna it relates this miracle as well.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2837"><sup>164</sup> In the name of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2838"><sup>165</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you.

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 17</title>
<p>1. JOURNEYED. Scripture is being brief in saying <italic>by their stages.</italic> For <italic>from the wilderness of Sin</italic> Israel journeyed to Dophkah; from there to Alush, and from Alush they went to Rephidim.<sup><xref rid="fn2844">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>[ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT OF THE LORD.] Its meaning is, as I have already noted,<sup><xref rid="fn2845">2</xref></sup> via the hand of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2846">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. WHEREFORE THE PEOPLE STROVE. Scripture mentions <italic>the people,</italic> not <span class="underline">all</span> of the people as it does with regard to the manna,<sup><xref rid="fn2847">4</xref></sup> for there were two parties. One had no water to drink. This is the group<sup><xref rid="fn2848">5</xref></sup> that strove with Moses. The second group had water which they brought from Alush. This group,<sup><xref rid="fn2849">6</xref></sup> as Scripture goes on to say,<sup><xref rid="fn2850">7</xref></sup> wanted to test God and see if He would provide water.</p>
<p>GIVE US WATER. They spoke to Moses and Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn2851">8</xref></sup> There was no need to mention Aaron,<sup><xref rid="fn2852">9</xref></sup> for I have already explained that Moses spoke to Israel only through Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn2853">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHY STRIVE YE WITH ME?] Moses answered them,<sup><xref rid="fn2854">11</xref></sup> <italic>Why strive ye with me?</italic> Let us all cry out unto the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn2855">12</xref></sup> He said, <italic>wherefore do ye try the Lord</italic>? to those who wanted to test God.<sup><xref rid="fn2856">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND THE PEOPLE THIRSTED. When the thirst overpowered them they raged against Moses and accused him of doing them evil in bringing them out of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2857">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND THE PEOPLE CRIED&#x2026;THEY ARE ALMOST READY TO STONE ME. Scripture speaks metaphorically.<sup><xref rid="fn2858">15</xref></sup> Its meaning is: they have striven with me and they rage against me. If they had the power they would stone me.</p>
<p>5. AND THE LORD SAID. Some say that because Moses said, <italic>they are almost ready to stone me,</italic> God told him, <italic>Pass on before the people</italic> who strive with you and inform them that you will now give them water.<sup><xref rid="fn2859">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND TAKE WITH THEE OF THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL; AND THY ROD, WHEREWITH THOU SMOTEST THE RIVER. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn2860">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. BEHOLD, I WILL STAND BEFORE THEE THERE UPON THE ROCK IN HOREB. Its meaning is, you will find Me there, the idea being you will encounter My strength and power on Horeb.<sup><xref rid="fn2861">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THOU SHALT STRIKE THE ROCK. Which contains no water.<sup><xref rid="fn2862">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND MOSES DID SO.] Scripture is being brief, for it does not mention, <italic>and the congregation drank, and their cattle</italic> (Num. 20:11).<sup><xref rid="fn2863">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. CALLED. Moses or someone.<sup><xref rid="fn2864">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>MASSAH AND MERIBAH. Because of the two reasons noted.<sup><xref rid="fn2865">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is the style of the Hebrew language to begin its comments with the second of two items when two particulars are listed,<sup><xref rid="fn2866">23</xref></sup> as the second item is at hand. Compare, <italic>And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau</italic> (Josh. 24:4), which is followed by <italic>and I gave unto Esau</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.). Scripture similarly first mentions Massah and then Meribah and turns to explain that the name of the place was called Meribah <italic>because of the striving of the children of Israel</italic> with Moses. It then explains that the place was called Massah <italic>because they tried the Lord.</italic> Now &#x201C;trial&#x201D; refers to Israel&#x2019;s asking, <italic>Is the Lord among us</italic> to provide for all of our needs? This second party angered God more than the first.<sup><xref rid="fn2867">24</xref></sup> Scripture therefore says, <italic>Ye shall not try the Lord your God, as ye tried Him in Massah</italic> (Deut. 6:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2868">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. THEN CAME AMALEK. The reference is to the nation of Amalek, which <italic>dwelleth in the land of the South</italic> (Num. 13:29).<sup><xref rid="fn2869">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND MOSES SAID UNTO JOSHUA. Joshua was the grandson<sup><xref rid="fn2870">27</xref></sup> of Prince Elishama ben Ammihud, the possessor of the banner of the tribe of Ephraim.<sup><xref rid="fn2871">28</xref></sup> Scripture refers to him here as Joshua,<sup><xref rid="fn2872">29</xref></sup> which is the name by which Moses called him in the account of the spies.<sup><xref rid="fn2873">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>CHOOSE US OUT. It is Hebrew style to speak in this manner.<sup><xref rid="fn2874">31</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>choose thee</italic> (II Sam. 24:12); <italic>Tarry ye here for us</italic> (Ex. 24:14).</p>
<p>MEN. Renowned, powerful men and men of war, as in <italic>all of them men</italic> (Num. 13:3).</p>
<p>AND GO OUT, FIGHT WITH AMALEK. Go out from the camp of Israel to fight against Amalek.</p>
<p>I WILL STAND ON TOP OF THE HILL. Horeb, which is the same as Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>WITH THE ROD OF GOD IN MY HAND. With which I will lift my hand to pray.</p>
<p>10. SO JOSHUA DID. Aaron and Hur are mentioned because of the need to explain (they) <italic>stayed up his hands</italic> (v. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn2875">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND IT CAME TO PASS. Some say that Moses held his hand<sup><xref rid="fn2876">33</xref></sup> up in a manner similar to one holding up a banner in war.<sup><xref rid="fn2877">34</xref></sup> However, if this was the case then Aaron or Hur would have lifted the rod up or they would have placed it on a high place on the mountain so that the people would see it standing. The correct interpretation is the one offered by the ancient sages.<sup><xref rid="fn2878">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. BUT MOSES&#x2019; HANDS WERE HEAVY. We know that a human being does not have the strength to hold his hands up for an entire day. One cannot even hold them up for a few hours, certainly not until <italic>the going down of the sun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2879">36</xref></sup> Now Scripture notes that Moses&#x2019; hands were heavier than the hands of other old people.<sup><xref rid="fn2880">37</xref></sup> Moses thus could not continually hold his hands up.</p>
<p>[AND PUT IT.] Its meaning is, they strengthened his place<sup><xref rid="fn2881">38</xref></sup> because he was not able to stand up.<sup><xref rid="fn2882">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND AARON AND HUR. Stood.</p>
<p>Scripture employs the masculine <italic>kevedim</italic> (heavy)<sup><xref rid="fn2883">40</xref></sup> and similarly reads, <italic>mi-zeh echad u-mi-zeh echad</italic> (the one on the one side, and the other on the other side).<sup><xref rid="fn2884">41</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-hinneh yad sheluchah elai, ve-hinneh vo megillat sefer</italic> (behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein) is similar (Ezek. 2:9).<sup><xref rid="fn2885">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HIS HANDS WERE STEADY. Each one of his hands.<sup><xref rid="fn2886">43</xref></sup> The phrase is grammatically similar to <italic>Its branches run over the wall</italic> (Gen. 49:22)<sup><xref rid="fn2887">44</xref></sup> and <italic>But the righteous</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2888">45</xref></sup> <italic>are secure as a young lion</italic> (Prov. 28:1).</p>
<p>STEADY. <italic>Emunah</italic> (steady) is a noun meaning something lasting and permanent.<sup><xref rid="fn2889">46</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>emunah</italic> comes from the same root as the word <italic>omen</italic> (brought up)<sup><xref rid="fn2890">47</xref></sup> in <italic>And he brought up Hadassah</italic> (Esth. 2:7). Aaron and Hur were like nursemaids who lifted up his hands.<sup><xref rid="fn2891">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND JOSHUA DISCOMFITED AMALEK. There is no difference between <italic>va-yachalosh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2892">49</xref></sup> (discomfited or weakened) and <italic>va-yechelash</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2893">50</xref></sup> (weakened) (Job 14:10).<sup><xref rid="fn2894">51</xref></sup> Likewise, the word <italic>yitrof</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2895">52</xref></sup> (tear) (Ps. 7:3) means the same as <italic>yitraf</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2896">53</xref></sup> (tears) (Gen. 49:27).<sup><xref rid="fn2897">54</xref></sup> The same is the case with the words <italic>tiddor</italic> (voweth)<sup><xref rid="fn2898">55</xref></sup> in <italic>voweth a vow</italic> (Num. 30:4) and <italic>va-yiddar</italic> (vowed),<sup><xref rid="fn2899">56</xref></sup> which is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> in <italic>and Jacob vowed a vow</italic> (Gen. 28:20). However, this root,<sup><xref rid="fn2900">57</xref></sup> like the word <italic>shav</italic> (returned), is sometimes transitive and sometimes intransitive.<sup><xref rid="fn2901">58</xref></sup> Or,<sup><xref rid="fn2902">59</xref></sup> <italic>va-yechelash</italic> (weakened) in <italic>a man</italic> (gever) <italic>dieth, and is weakened</italic> (Job 14:10) means he was already weakened,<sup><xref rid="fn2903">60</xref></sup> like the word <italic>va-yivash</italic> (and rotted)<sup><xref rid="fn2904">61</xref></sup> in <italic>and it bred worms, and rotted</italic> (Ex. 16:20). Scripture therefore employs the term <italic>gever</italic> (man), which indicates a mighty man.<sup><xref rid="fn2905">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. WRITE THIS FOR A MEMORIAL IN THE BOOK. This chapter<sup><xref rid="fn2906">63</xref></sup> was said in the fortieth year.<sup><xref rid="fn2907">64</xref></sup> The fact that Scripture reads <italic>ba-sefer</italic> (in <span class="underline">the</span> book) with a <italic>pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>bet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2908">65</xref></sup> is proof of the aforementioned. For <italic>ba-sefer</italic> refers to the well-known book, that is, the book of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2909">66</xref></sup> It is also possible that they had another book<sup><xref rid="fn2910">67</xref></sup> known as <italic>The Book of the Wars of the Lord</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2911">68</xref></sup> which was lost to us, as were the <italic>Sefer Ha-Yashar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2912">69</xref></sup> and the <italic>Midrash of Iddo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2913">70</xref></sup> and the <italic>Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2914">71</xref></sup> and the works of Solomon.<sup><xref rid="fn2915">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN THE EARS OF JOSHUA.] For God knew that Joshua was destined to wage war with the kings of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn2916">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FOR I WILL UTTERLY BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK.] Because Amalek angered God. For the chiefs of Edom and similarly those of Moab and of Philistia feared and trembled before God because of the signs which the Lord displayed in Egypt and at the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn2917">74</xref></sup> Now this very Amalek heard of the might that God displayed on behalf of His people Israel. Behold, he came from a distant place to wage war against Israel. He did not fear God. Indeed, Scripture explicitly states, <italic>and he</italic> (Amalek) <italic>feared not God</italic> (Deut. 25:18).<sup><xref rid="fn2918">75</xref></sup> Some say that Amalek was the name of a king.<sup><xref rid="fn2919">76</xref></sup> They say this because Scripture reads, <italic>Amalek and his people.</italic> On the other hand, it is possible that another nation joined Amalek.<sup><xref rid="fn2920">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND MOSES BUILT AN ALTAR. On Horeb. The word <italic>mizbe&#x2019;ach</italic> (altar) is to be read as if written twice. Our verse is to be read as if written, <italic>mizbach Adonai</italic> (the altar of the Lord).<sup><xref rid="fn2921">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. THE HAND UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD. It is as if God put His hand upon His throne. This was the taking of an oath.<sup><xref rid="fn2922">79</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>For I lift up My hand to heaven</italic> (Deut. 32:40).<sup><xref rid="fn2923">80</xref></sup> Rabbi Joshua says that its<sup><xref rid="fn2924">81</xref></sup> meaning is that the first one to sit upon the throne of Israel, the reference being to Saul,<sup><xref rid="fn2925">82</xref></sup> will have a mighty hand.<sup><xref rid="fn2926">83</xref></sup> We similarly find it said concerning Solomon: <italic>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord</italic> (I Chron. 29:23).</p>
<ftnote id="fn2844"><sup>1</sup> See Num. 33:12-14. In other words, <italic>by their stages</italic> alludes to all the places that Israel stopped between Sin and Rephidim.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2845"><sup>2</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 15:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2846"><sup>3</sup> Moses alone, rather than the pillars of cloud and fire, now led the people.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2847"><sup>4</sup> See Ex. 16:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2848"><sup>5</sup> <italic>The people</italic> mentioned in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2849"><sup>6</sup> The second group did not strive with Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2850"><sup>7</sup> In the last part of our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2851"><sup>8</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>tenu</italic> (give). <italic>Tenu</italic> is in the plural, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2852"><sup>9</sup> In our verse even though the people&#x2019;s words were also directed at him. Aaron is not mentioned in our verse, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2853"><sup>10</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 4:30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2854"><sup>11</sup> The first party.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2855"><sup>12</sup> This, according to I.E., is implied in <italic>Why strive ye with me?</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2856"><sup>13</sup> The second party.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2857"><sup>14</sup> Hence <italic>and the people murmured</italic> follows <italic>and the people thirsted.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2858"><sup>15</sup> Moses was not in actual danger of being stoned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2859"><sup>16</sup> In this interpretation, <italic>pass on before the people</italic> is short for: pass on before the people who strive with you, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2860"><sup>17</sup> Moses did not personally smite the river. He told Aaron to do so. See Ex. 7:19 and I.E. on Ex. 17:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2861"><sup>18</sup> Our verse is not to be taken literally. It should be understood as: you will find My strength and power upon the rock in Horeb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2862"><sup>19</sup> At present.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2863"><sup>20</sup> As it does in recording a similar account in the wilderness of Sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2864"><sup>21</sup> Our verse literally reads, <italic>And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah.</italic> The subject is omitted, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2865"><sup>22</sup> In our verse Massah means trying and Meribah strife.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2866"><sup>23</sup> Scripture first mentions Massah and then Meribah. It then goes on to first explain Meribah and then Massah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2867"><sup>24</sup> For the first complained because they were overpowered by thirst.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2868"><sup>25</sup> The first party is not mentioned at all in this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2869"><sup>26</sup> And not to any other nation or person by that name. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on verse 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2870"><sup>27</sup> Reading <italic>nin,</italic> as in <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 38 and in some of the printed editions. Some editions have <italic>nun.</italic> The latter is probably a scribal error. However, Filwarg believes it to be correct and tries to justify it. It is also possible that I.E. was playing on the words <italic>nin</italic> and <italic>nun,</italic> the former meaning grandson and the latter being the name of Joshua&#x2019;s father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2871"><sup>28</sup> Cf. Num. 1:10; 2:18; I Chron. 7:26, 27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2872"><sup>29</sup> His birth name was <italic>Hoshe&#x2019;a.</italic> See Num. 13:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2873"><sup>30</sup> See Num. 13:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2874"><sup>31</sup> To employ the possessive pronoun, <italic>lakh</italic> (for thee) or <italic>lanu</italic> (for us) for purposes of emphasis.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2875"><sup>32</sup> Since Scripture goes on to note that Aaron and Hur held up Moses&#x2019; hands it first had to tell us that they went up the hill with Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2876"><sup>33</sup> Which grasped the rod of the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2877"><sup>34</sup> Cf. Rashbam.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2878"><sup>35</sup> Moses&#x2019; raised hands served to direct the heart of Israel towards heaven. Cf. <italic>Rosh Ha-Shanah</italic> 3:8: &#x201C;Now do the hands of Moses promote or hinder the battle&#x0021; It is rather to teach you that when the Israelites directed their thoughts on high and subjected their hearts to their Father in heaven, they prevailed; and if not they were defeated.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2879"><sup>36</sup> Therefore what purpose does Scripture have in telling us <italic>but Moses&#x2019; hands were heavy</italic>?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2880"><sup>37</sup> Ibn Ezra does not indicate why Moses&#x2019; hands were heavier than those of other people his age.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2881"><sup>38</sup> By placing a stone beneath him (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2882"><sup>39</sup> Not only were Moses&#x2019; hands tired but Moses himself was unable to stand.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2883"><sup>40</sup> Rather than the feminine <italic>kevedot</italic>. <italic>Yad</italic> (hand) is a feminine, hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2884"><sup>41</sup> I.E. interprets our text as meaning: one was supporting this hand and one was supporting the other hand. In other words, <italic>mi-zeh</italic> refers to the hands. However, since <italic>yad</italic> is feminine Scripture should have read <italic>mi-zot echad u-mi-zot echad.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2885"><sup>42</sup> <italic>Vo</italic> (therein) is masculine. However, <italic>yad</italic> is feminine. We thus see that Scripture occasionally combines feminine nouns with masculine pronouns or adjectives.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2886"><sup>43</sup> <italic>Yadav</italic> (his hands) is plural; <italic>emunah</italic> (steady) is singular. Hence <italic>va-yehi yadav emunah</italic> (and his hands were steady) means: and his hands was steady. I.E. holds that when a verb or an adjective in the plural governs or modifies a noun in the singular, the verb or adjective refers to each one within the plural. Hence, &#x201C;and his hands was steady&#x201D; means: and each one of his hands was steady. See Vol. 1, Foreword, p. xvii.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2887"><sup>44</sup> <italic>Banot</italic> (its branches) is plural; <italic>tza&#x2019;adah</italic> (run) is singular. According to I.E., Gen. 49:22 should be translated: each one of its branches runs over the wall. See I.E. on Gen. 49:22 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2888"><sup>45</sup> <italic>Tzadikim</italic> (righteous) is plural; <italic>kefir</italic> (young lion) is singular. According to I.E., Prov. 28:1 should be translated: but each one of the righteous is secure as a young lion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2889"><sup>46</sup> Literally, standing and everlasting. Moses&#x2019; hands turned into something firm and steadfast (Shadal), for he did not lower his hands but held them up steadily. The image is of something pillar-like.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2890"><sup>47</sup> The noun <italic>omen</italic> means a person who raises a child. Cf. Num. 11:12; II Kings 10:1; Is. 49:2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2891"><sup>48</sup> Netter. The idea being that Aaron and Hur lifted up Moses&#x2019; hands the way a nursemaid carries a child. Thus <italic>va-yehi yadav emunah</italic> (and his hands were steady) means: and his hands were nursed by nursemaids. For other interpretations and possible translations see Weiser and Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2892"><sup>49</sup> Which is an <italic>efol.</italic></ftnote>

<h1>YITRO</h1>
<p align="blockquote">The word of Abram,<sup><xref rid="fn2927">1</xref></sup> the prisoner of hope;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Who loosened his bowstring (<italic>yitro</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2928">2</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">Half of his courage is forever gone;</p>
<p align="blockquote">And the rest<sup><xref rid="fn2929">3</xref></sup> (<italic>yitro</italic>) was dissipated by his tortuous wanderings.</p>
<p align="blockquote">This<sup><xref rid="fn2930">4</xref></sup> is a comment<sup><xref rid="fn2931">5</xref></sup> upon the chapter</p>
<p align="blockquote">Which opens with the word <italic>Yitro</italic> (Jethro).</p>
<p>1. NOW JETHRO HEARD. Scripture notes above<sup><xref rid="fn2932">6</xref></sup> the incident of Amalek because Amalek came to Rephidim.<sup><xref rid="fn2933">7</xref></sup> Now the chapter that opens with the words <italic>In the third month</italic> (Ex. 19:1) should have followed the incident of Amalek,<sup><xref rid="fn2934">8</xref></sup> for Scripture states there, <italic>And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai</italic> (Ex. 19:2).<sup><xref rid="fn2935">9</xref></sup> This being the case, why was the account of Jethro inserted between these two chapters?<sup><xref rid="fn2936">10</xref></sup> Saadiah Gaon says that Jethro came to the wilderness of Sinai before the giving of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2937">11</xref></sup> However, I believe that Jethro came to Sinai in the second year,<sup><xref rid="fn2938">12</xref></sup> after the erection of the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn2939">13</xref></sup> For the chapter<sup><xref rid="fn2940">14</xref></sup> speaks of <italic>a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God</italic> (v. 12),<sup><xref rid="fn2941">15</xref></sup> and it does not mention that he built a new altar.<sup><xref rid="fn2942">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture writes, <italic>and I make them know the statutes of God, and His laws</italic> (v. 16).<sup><xref rid="fn2943">17</xref></sup> Now this<sup><xref rid="fn2944">18</xref></sup> took place after the giving of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2945">19</xref></sup> True proof that my words are correct is the fact that Scripture clearly states, <italic>where he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2946">20</xref></sup> <italic>was encamped, at the mount of God</italic> (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn2947">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Moses spoke to Hobab,<sup><xref rid="fn2948">22</xref></sup> the latter being Jethro as I explained in the Torah portion <italic>These Are The Names</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2949">23</xref></sup> For <italic>Moses&#x2019; father-in-law</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2950">24</xref></sup> does not refer to Reuel, which precedes the term father-in-law,<sup><xref rid="fn2951">25</xref></sup> but refers to Hobab.<sup><xref rid="fn2952">26</xref></sup> Scripture clearly states, <italic>from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses</italic> (Jud. 4:11). Moses told Hobab, [<italic>Leave us not, I pray thee</italic>] <italic>forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness</italic> (Num. 10:31). Now we know that Israel camped around Sinai for about a year. Lo and behold, Moses&#x2019; very words prove this to be so. For Moses is quoted in the Torah portion, <italic>These are the words</italic> as saying, <italic>The Lord our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying: &#x2026;turn you, and take your journey</italic> (Deut. 1:6,7).<sup><xref rid="fn2953">27</xref></sup> Now this was said close to their time of journey.<sup><xref rid="fn2954">28</xref></sup> Moses continued, <italic>And I spoke unto you at that time saying: I am not able to bear you myself alone</italic> (Deut. 1:9); for <italic>the Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude</italic> (Deut. 1:10). The reason Moses mentioned this to them was that God told Jacob, <italic>Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession</italic> (Gen. 48:4). Now the meaning of the latter is: when your seed increase I will give them the land. Moses therefore said, <italic>the Lord your God hath multiplied you</italic> and the time for you to inherit the land has come. However, since you are so numerous I was not able to carry you alone,<sup><xref rid="fn2955">29</xref></sup> and I had to place over you captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.<sup><xref rid="fn2956">30</xref></sup> Now this<sup><xref rid="fn2957">31</xref></sup> was the advice given to Moses by Jethro on the morrow following his coming to the wilderness of Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn2958">32</xref></sup> Moses therefore said to Hobab, who, as we explained, is to be identified with Jethro, <italic>We are journeying</italic> (Num. 10:29).<sup><xref rid="fn2959">33</xref></sup> Hobab responded, <italic>I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred</italic> (Num. 10:30). This is what <italic>And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land</italic> (v. 27) refers to.</p>
<p>I will now explain why the chapter dealing with Jethro was inserted here. It was placed here because Scripture had just mentioned the evil that Amalek did to Israel. The Torah wants to contrast it with the good that Jethro rendered Israel. Scripture notes, <italic>And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to Israel</italic> (v. 9) and that he gave proper and correct counsel to Moses and Israel. Moses told Jethro, <italic>and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes</italic> (Num. 10:31), meaning that he enlightened their eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn2960">34</xref></sup> King Saul similarly said,<sup><xref rid="fn2961">35</xref></sup> <italic>for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel</italic> (I Sam. 15:6).<sup><xref rid="fn2962">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now because Scripture states in the preceding chapter, <italic>the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation</italic> (Ex. 17:16), namely, that when God gives Israel rest they are obligated to wage war against Amalek, the Torah mentions the account of Jethro. For the descendants of Jethro lived in proximity to the nation of Amalek,<sup><xref rid="fn2963">37</xref></sup> and the Torah wants Israel to remember the kindness that Jethro demonstrated so that they do not harm his seed. Thus we find the Rechabites, who were descended from Jethro, living among the children of Israel in Jerusalem. We find Jonadab the son of Rechab<sup><xref rid="fn2964">38</xref></sup> in the time of Jeremiah (Jer. 35:19).<sup><xref rid="fn2965">39</xref></sup> There is another chapter similar to the one above.<sup><xref rid="fn2966">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>ALL THAT GOD (<italic>ELOHIM</italic>) HAD DONE. Scripture employs the name of God<sup><xref rid="fn2967">41</xref></sup> that was known in the world before the appearance of Moses, for all admitted that God existed.<sup><xref rid="fn2968">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND FOR ISRAEL HIS PEOPLE. God&#x2019;s people, or the people of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2969">43</xref></sup> It is possible that the <italic>lamed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2970">44</xref></sup> should be translated as &#x201C;because,&#x201D; that is, because of Moses and Israel, the reference being to the plagues and the drowning of Pharaoh.</p>
<p>HOW THAT THE LORD (<italic>YHVH</italic>) HAD BROUGHT. Scripture employs the divine name revealed to Moses, since it was through the miracles<sup><xref rid="fn2971">45</xref></sup> that Israel went out of Egypt.</p>
<p>2. AND JETHRO TOOK. Scripture reads, Moses&#x2019; wife, and not Jethro&#x2019;s daughter, because Moses was more important than her father&#x2019;s house.<sup><xref rid="fn2972">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>AFTER HE HAD SENT HER AWAY. Some say that Moses gave her permission to return to her father&#x2019;s house, at the lodging place, prior to his returning alone to Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2973">47</xref></sup> Other say she sent gifts to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2974">48</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>shilluchim</italic> (gifts) in <italic>gifts unto his daughter</italic> (I Kings 9:16).<sup><xref rid="fn2975">49</xref></sup></p>

Thus <italic>Hushim</italic> (Gen. 46:23) and <italic>Shuham</italic> (Num. 26:42) are one and the same. <italic>Yabetz</italic> (Jabez)<sup><xref rid="fn2982">56</xref></sup> was so called because his mother bore him in pain (<italic>otzev</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2983">57</xref></sup> Sometimes a letter is dropped in a name, as in the case of Maacah<sup><xref rid="fn2984">58</xref></sup> which is a variant of Micah.<sup><xref rid="fn2985">59</xref></sup> The reverse is true of <italic>Yov</italic> (Iob) (Gen. 46:13), which is the same as <italic>Yashuv</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2986">60</xref></sup> (Jashub) (Num. 26:24). Many say it is the same<sup><xref rid="fn2987">61</xref></sup> with <italic>Shemu&#x2019;el</italic> (Samuel), which<sup><xref rid="fn2988">62</xref></sup> is derived from <italic>she&#x2019;iltihu</italic> (I have asked him) (I Sam. 1:20).<sup><xref rid="fn2989">63</xref></sup> However, in my opinion a <italic>shuruk</italic> has been substituted here<sup><xref rid="fn2990">64</xref></sup> for a <italic>cholam,</italic> as in the case of <italic>Tohu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2991">65</xref></sup> (I Sam. 1:1) and <italic>Toah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2992">66</xref></sup> (I Chron. 6:19); <italic>Zuph</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2993">67</xref></sup> (I Sam. 1:1) and <italic>Zophai</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2994">68</xref></sup> (I Chron. 6:11); <italic>Nun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2995">69</xref></sup> (Ex. 33:11) and <italic>Non</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2996">70</xref></sup> (I Chron. 7:26).

<p>4. AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER<sup><xref rid="fn3010">84</xref></sup> WAS. It is the custom in Hebrew to say, &#x201C;This is how the second one was called.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3011">85</xref></sup> At other times it uses the term &#x201C;the one,&#x201D; as in<sup><xref rid="fn3012">86</xref></sup> <italic>and the name of one was Bozez, and the name of the other was Seneh</italic> (I Sam. 14:4).<sup><xref rid="fn3013">87</xref></sup></p>

<p>5. AND CAME. Scripture notes that Jethro followed etiquette when he came to Moses. Jethro went first, the sons of Moses went behind him, and after them Moses&#x2019; wife, as is the custom.</p>
<p>WHERE HE WAS ENCAMPED. He encamped there for many days.<sup><xref rid="fn3017">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND HE SAID UNTO MOSES. He had already said<sup><xref rid="fn3018">92</xref></sup> unto Moses prior to his coming,<sup><xref rid="fn3019">93</xref></sup> via an agent<sup><xref rid="fn3020">94</xref></sup> or by a written message: I thy father-in-law Jethro am coming unto thee, and also thy wife, who is uppermost in importance, and her two sons who are coming with her.</p>
<p>7. AND MOSES WENT OUT TO MEET HIS FATHER-IN-LAW. Out of regard for Jethro and his wisdom, but not out of regard for his<sup><xref rid="fn3021">95</xref></sup> wife and children, for it is not customary for a respected person to go out to meet his wife or children.</p>
<p>AND BOWED DOWN. <italic>Va-yishtachu</italic> (and bowed down) is grammatically difficult.<sup><xref rid="fn3022">96</xref></sup> We know that it comes from a root ending in a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3023">97</xref></sup> The <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>va-yishtachu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3024">98</xref></sup> is in place of a <italic>heh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3025">99</xref></sup> like the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>shalev</italic> (at ease)<sup><xref rid="fn3026">100</xref></sup> in <italic>I was at ease</italic> (Job 16:12), from whose root we get the word <italic>shalavti</italic> (at ease) in <italic>I was not at ease</italic> (Job 3:26). Now the term <italic>va-yishtachaveh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3027">101</xref></sup> should have been employed in the singular,<sup><xref rid="fn3028">102</xref></sup> rather than <italic>va-yishtachu,</italic> for the <italic>tav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3029">103</xref></sup> is a sign of the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic> conjugation. It is like the <italic>tav</italic> in <italic>mishta&#x2019;eh</italic> (steadfastly)<sup><xref rid="fn3030">104</xref></sup> in <italic>And the man looked steadfastly on her</italic> (Gen. 24:21). For the rule relating to the dentals<sup><xref rid="fn3031">105</xref></sup> states that if the first letter of a root before which the <italic>tav</italic> of the <italic>hitpa&#x2019;el</italic> conjugation is placed<sup><xref rid="fn3032">106</xref></sup> is a dental, then<sup><xref rid="fn3033">107</xref></sup> [the tav is placed after the first root letter].<sup><xref rid="fn3034">108</xref></sup> Now because the <italic>heh</italic> has been changed into a <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>va-yishtachu</italic> Hebrew allows the first <italic>vav,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3035">109</xref></sup> which is not a plural suffix, to remain in place of the root <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3036">110</xref></sup> and silences the <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3037">111</xref></sup> Hence the word reads <italic>va-yishtachu.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3038">112</xref></sup> Now a <italic>vav</italic> at the end of a word is the sign of the plural suffix when silent as in <italic>titra&#x2019;u</italic> (look one upon the other) in <italic>Why do ye look one upon the other</italic> (Gen. 42:1). Thus the word <italic>va-yishtachu,</italic> ending in a silent <italic>vav,</italic> would appear to be in the plural. <italic>Va-yishtachu</italic> was therefore penultimately accented<sup><xref rid="fn3039">113</xref></sup> to differentiate between it and the customary way of vocalizing plurals.<sup><xref rid="fn3040">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND BOWED DOWN.] Logically speaking, the one who goes out is the one who bows to his counterpart.<sup><xref rid="fn3041">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>[EACH OTHER.] Scripture refers to Jethro as Moses&#x2019; friend because of his greatness in wisdom.<sup><xref rid="fn3042">116</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY CAME INTO THE TENT. Which was known as Moses&#x2019; tent.</p>
<p>8. AND MOSES TOLD. This verse indicates that the meaning of <italic>for Moses, and for Israel</italic> (v. 1) is: because of them.<sup><xref rid="fn3043">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE TRAVAIL. <italic>Tela&#x2019;ah</italic> (travail) comes from the same root as <italic>ve-nilu</italic> (shall loathe)<sup><xref rid="fn3044">118</xref></sup> in <italic>and the Egyptians shall loathe</italic> (Ex. 7:18). The <italic>tav</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn3045">119</xref></sup> Its meaning is, an affliction which a person is unable to bear or verbalize. It refers to Egypt&#x2019;s pursuit of Israel at the sea, the war with Amalek, and the thirst and hunger which the congregation suffered. God delivered them from all of these.</p>
<p>9. AND JETHRO REJOICED. <italic>Va-yichad</italic> (rejoiced) comes from the same root as the word <italic>chedvah</italic> (rejoicing).<sup><xref rid="fn3046">120</xref></sup> It should have been vocalized like the word <italic>va-yift</italic> (enticed) in <italic>And my heart hath been secretly enticed</italic> (Job 31:27) and <italic>va-yishb</italic> (and took captive) in <italic>and took some of them captive</italic> (Num. 21:1).<sup><xref rid="fn3047">121</xref></sup> However, the <italic>chet</italic> was vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3048">122</xref></sup> because it is a guttural, and the <italic>dagesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3049">123</xref></sup> remains in the <italic>dalet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3050">124</xref></sup> as it was. I am not aware of a letter having a <italic>dagesh</italic> at the end of a word in all of Scripture except in the case of a <italic>bet, gimel, dalet, kaf, peh, tav</italic> at the end of a word when two <italic>sheva&#x2019;im</italic> come together,<sup><xref rid="fn3051">125</xref></sup> as in the word <italic>va-yishb</italic> (and took captive)<sup><xref rid="fn3052">126</xref></sup> in <italic>and took some of them captive</italic> (Num. 21:1) and <italic>va-yesht</italic> (and he drank)<sup><xref rid="fn3053">127</xref></sup> in <italic>And he drank of the wine</italic> (Gen. 9:21). However, we never find a <italic>dagesh</italic> at the end of a word when preceded by a vowel<sup><xref rid="fn3054">128</xref></sup> except in the case of a <italic>pattach.</italic> In the latter case we find two such words namely, <italic>va-yichad</italic> (rejoiced) in <italic>And Jethro rejoiced</italic> and <italic>yichad</italic> (rejoice) in <italic>Let it not rejoice among the days of the year</italic> (Job 3:6).</p>
<p>10. AND JETHRO SAID: BLESSED BE THE LORD. Give your attention to the grammatical explanation of the word <italic>barukh</italic> (blessed). Note that the <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3055">129</xref></sup> can only be formed from transitive verbs. If you find a verb following the <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic> form, look around; if you find it has a transitive <italic>po&#x2019;el</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3056">130</xref></sup> form, then the word is a real <italic>pa&#x2019;ul.</italic> However, if you do not find it to be so,<sup><xref rid="fn3057">131</xref></sup> then the word<sup><xref rid="fn3058">132</xref></sup> is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn3059">133</xref></sup> Similarly, if a word is in the <italic>po&#x2019;el</italic> form and its root does not come in the <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic> in the same conjugation, then the word is also not a <italic>po&#x2019;el</italic> but an adjective. For example, the <italic>po&#x2019;el</italic> and <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic> forms of <italic>shamar</italic> (kept) are <italic>shomer</italic> (keeps) and <italic>shamur</italic> (kept).<sup><xref rid="fn3060">134</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>shamur</italic> in <italic>riches kept by the owner thereof to his hurt</italic> (Eccles. 5:12). Now we encounter <italic>holekh</italic> (goes), <italic>omed</italic> (stands), <italic>yotze</italic> (goes out). All these words appear to be verbs in the <italic>po&#x2019;el,</italic> for they follow the form of <italic>shomer.</italic> However, since these roots form intransitive verbs, for one cannot say <italic>halukh</italic> (wented), <italic>amud</italic> (stooded up), <italic>yatzu</italic> (wented out), these words do not come in the <italic>pa&#x2019;ul.</italic> Therefore when Scripture uses the term <italic>holekh</italic> (went) in <italic>because he went</italic> (Num. 22:21), it employs an adjective, not a verb.</p>
<p>We find [Scripture using] the word <italic>atzum</italic> (mighty). The word appears to be a <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic> because it follows the paradigm of <italic>shamur</italic> (kept). However, when we investigated this root we found the word <italic>va-ya&#x2019;atzmu</italic> (waxed mighty), in <italic>and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty</italic> (Ex. 1:7), to be among the intransitive verbs. For its transitive form comes in the <italic>hifil</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3061">135</xref></sup> as in <italic>va-ya&#x2019;atzimehu</italic> (and made them too mighty) in <italic>and made them too mighty for their adversaries</italic> (Ps. 105:24). Now we cannot say that <italic>otzem</italic> (strengthens) following the paradigm of <italic>shomer</italic> (keeps) means strength,<sup><xref rid="fn3062">136</xref></sup> for in this case it has a different meaning, as in <italic>otzem</italic> (shutteth) in <italic>And shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil</italic> (Is. 33:15).</p>
<p>Now we find the word <italic>barukh,</italic> which follows the paradigm of <italic>shamur</italic> (kept). We searched all of Scripture and we did not see this root<sup><xref rid="fn3063">137</xref></sup> used with this meaning<sup><xref rid="fn3064">138</xref></sup> in all of the <italic>kal</italic> conjugation.<sup><xref rid="fn3065">139</xref></sup> We found it used<sup><xref rid="fn3066">140</xref></sup> only with another meaning, namely, to kneel, as in <italic>va-yivrakh</italic> (kneeled) in <italic>and kneeled down upon his knees</italic> (I Chron. 6:13), which<sup><xref rid="fn3067">141</xref></sup> is also intransitive and does not have a <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3068">142</xref></sup> form. The word <italic>barukh</italic> (blessed) is thus like the word <italic>atzum</italic> (might), a <italic>kal</italic> adjective.</p>
<p>Rabbi Merinus<sup><xref rid="fn3069">143</xref></sup> says that <italic>barukh</italic> (blessed) is an adjective in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el.</italic> Its <italic>resh</italic> should have received a <italic>dagesh</italic> like all other such roots,<sup><xref rid="fn3070">144</xref></sup> such as <italic>berekh</italic> (curse)<sup><xref rid="fn3071">145</xref></sup> in <italic>Naboth did curse</italic> (I Kings 21:13). <italic>Barukh</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>shakkul</italic> (bereaved)<sup><xref rid="fn3072">146</xref></sup> in <italic>as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps</italic> (Hos. 13:8). However, Rabbi Merinus spoke incorrectly, for all adjectives such as <italic>shakkul</italic> (bereaved), <italic>gibbor</italic> (warrior), <italic>shikkor</italic> (drunk)<sup><xref rid="fn3073">147</xref></sup> do not undergo any change by having the vowel that precedes the <italic>dagesh</italic> change in the singular construct or in the plural.<sup><xref rid="fn3074">148</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>gibbor</italic> (mighty man)<sup><xref rid="fn3075">149</xref></sup> in <italic>And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim</italic> (II Chron. 28:7), and <italic>gibborim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3076">150</xref></sup> (mighty) in <italic>Woe unto them that are mighty</italic> (Is. 5:22). Now the word <italic>berukh</italic> (blessed of),<sup><xref rid="fn3077">151</xref></sup> in <italic>Come in, thou blessed of the Lord</italic> (Gen. 24:31) and <italic>berukhim</italic> (blessed) in, <italic>Blessed be ye of the Lord</italic> (Ps. 115:15), argue against Rabbi Merinus.<sup><xref rid="fn3078">152</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHO HATH DELIVERED YOU. He said this<sup><xref rid="fn3079">153</xref></sup> to Moses and Aaron, who were God&#x2019;s messengers and through whom the plagues came upon Pharaoh and Egypt. Jethro therefore said, <italic>out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh.</italic> After this<sup><xref rid="fn3080">154</xref></sup> he blessed the Lord, <italic>who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians</italic> in Egypt and at the splitting of the Red Sea.<sup><xref rid="fn3081">155</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. NOW I KNOW. I have explained the meaning of <italic>now I know</italic> in the Torah portion <italic>Shemot,</italic> in the verse <italic>and they shall say to me: What is His name?</italic> (Ex. 3:13).<sup><xref rid="fn3082">156</xref></sup></p>
<p>[YEA, FOR THAT.] Because of the fact that the Egyptians dealt willfully with Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3083">157</xref></sup> Jethro similarly, noted above, <italic>I know that the Lord is greater than all gods</italic> in that he punished the Egyptians because they made Israel work with rigor. It is similarly written, <italic>Thou knewest that they dealt proudly</italic> (hezidu) <italic>against them</italic> (Neh. 9:11) that is, they<sup><xref rid="fn3084">158</xref></sup> behaved like a person who does whatever he wants to.<sup><xref rid="fn3085">159</xref></sup> Scripture already stated, <italic>for I know their pains; and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3086">160</xref></sup> (Ex. 3:7,8).</p>
<p>12. AND JETHRO, MOSES&#x2019; FATHER-IN-LAW, TOOK A BURNT-OFFERING AND SACRIFICES. The latter refers to peace-offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn3087">161</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FOR GOD.] The meaning of <italic>for God</italic> is that henceforth the revered Lord shall be his God.</p>
<p>AND AARON CAME, AND ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL. There is no need to mention Moses, as they were in Moses&#x2019; tent.</p>
<p>TO EAT BREAD. Peaceofferings.</p>
<p>[BEFORE GOD.] Scripture reads thus because Moses&#x2019; tent was on the east side of the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn3088">162</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE MORROW. Of Jethro&#x2019;s coming.</p>
<p>THAT MOSES SAT. As was his custom.</p>
<p>FROM THE MORNING UNTO THE EVENING. Note that true morning<sup><xref rid="fn3089">163</xref></sup> begins with sunrise. The term morning is, as I have previously noted,<sup><xref rid="fn3090">164</xref></sup> also applied to the breaking of dawn, when light begins to be seen in the clouds. In the latter instance the term is artificially used. Similarly, true evening begins when the sun sets. The term is also artificially applied up to the time that the light sets.<sup><xref rid="fn3091">165</xref></sup> David similarly said, <italic>The sun ariseth, they</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3092">166</xref></sup> <italic>slink away</italic> (Ps. 104:22). Scripture then states, <italic>Man goeth forth unto his work, And to his labor until the evening</italic> (Ps. 104:23).<sup><xref rid="fn3093">167</xref></sup> It is therefore fitting to interpret <italic>from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath</italic> (Lev. 23:32) to mean: from the true evening to the true evening.<sup><xref rid="fn3094">168</xref></sup> However, our sages of blessed memory &#x201C;added from the weekday to the holy day&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3095">169</xref></sup> and said that the Sabbath does not end until the stars come out.<sup><xref rid="fn3096">170</xref></sup> It is thus fitting from the Torah&#x2019;s point of view to start the Sabbath at sunset. All scientists and astronomers admit that the day&#x2019;s boundary is<sup><xref rid="fn3097">171</xref></sup> the moment when the circle of the sun faces all over the area of the earth. This starts at sunrise and ends at sunset.</p>
<p>14. AND&#x2026;SAW ALL THAT HE DID TO THE PEOPLE. That he caused them to stand from morning to evening. Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn3098">172</xref></sup> says that Jethro reacted in this manner because Moses alone sat and Israel stood, the latter being improper.<sup><xref rid="fn3099">173</xref></sup> There can be no doubt that Moses&#x2019; station was too great for Jethro to say this.<sup><xref rid="fn3100">174</xref></sup> For behold, Aaron, who was a great man in the eyes of Israel and was older than Moses, said to Moses, <italic>Oh my lord</italic> (Num. 12:11). Moses acted in the proper manner, for the judge sits and the litigants stand. We thus read, <italic>then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand</italic> (Deut. 19:17). Jethro said, <italic>why</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3101">175</xref></sup> to Moses for no reason other than that Moses was sitting alone and had no other judges to assist him.</p>
<p>[WHY.] Rabbi Merinus says that the word <italic>maddu&#x2019;a</italic> (why) is similar to <italic>mallakhem</italic> (what mean ye) (Is. 3:15) and to <italic>mazzeh</italic> (what is that) in <italic>what is that in thy hand</italic> (Ex. 4:2), each of which is a compound of two words.<sup><xref rid="fn3102">176</xref></sup> The same is true of <italic>maddu&#x2019;a,</italic> which means: what is in your mind that you do this?<sup><xref rid="fn3103">177</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND MOSES SAID. Moses answered, I do two things. One, <italic>Because the people come unto me to inquire of God,</italic> that is, to inquire of God&#x2019;s law.<sup><xref rid="fn3104">178</xref></sup> The other, <italic>when they have a matter, it cometh unto me</italic> (v. 16). Moses explained the second task first, namely, <italic>and I judge between a man and his neighbor</italic> (<italic>ibid</italic>.); and, he then said,<sup><xref rid="fn3105">179</xref></sup> to one who inquires, <italic>I make them know the statutes of God.</italic></p>
<p>17. AND&#x2026;SAID&#x2026;THE THING THAT THOU DOEST IS NOT GOOD. In my eyes. Jethro then explained himself, <italic>Thou wilt surely wear away. Navol tibbol</italic> (thou shalt surely wear away) comes from the same root as <italic>yibbol</italic> (wither)<sup><xref rid="fn3106">180</xref></sup> in <italic>And whose leaf doth not wither</italic> (Ps. 1:3) and <italic>novelet</italic> (fadeth)<sup><xref rid="fn3107">181</xref></sup> in <italic>For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth</italic> (Is. 1:30). Its meaning is, you shall, as it were, drop like a withered leaf. The word <italic>gam</italic> (both)<sup><xref rid="fn3108">182</xref></sup> is to be prefaced also to <italic>for the thing is too heavy for thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3109">183</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. TO PERFORM IT. <italic>Asohu</italic> (to perform it) is grammatically inconsistent.<sup><xref rid="fn3110">184</xref></sup> It follows the form of <italic>lishmerehu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3111">185</xref></sup> (to preserve him),<sup><xref rid="fn3112">186</xref></sup> for we do not find the <italic>heh</italic> to be visible in the root <italic>ayin, sin, heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3113">187</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. HEARKEN NOW UNTO MY VOICE, I WILL GIVE THEE COUNCIL. <italic>I&#x2019;atzekha,</italic> means I will give you council.</p>
<p>[GOD.] Note that the term <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) is, as I have noted, an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn3114">188</xref></sup> It is only because the word is used often that this adjective is considered as if it were a proper noun. Examples of the latter are: <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) in <italic>God will let me gaze upon my adversaries</italic> (Ps. 59:11); <italic>In the beginning God</italic> (Elohim)<italic>created the heaven and the earth</italic> (Gen. 1:1), and many other instances. It is for this reason that our sages of blessed memory placed <italic>Elohim</italic> among the names that are not erasable.<sup><xref rid="fn3115">189</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND GOD BE WITH THEE.] Its meaning is, God will help you if you act in this manner. At the close of his words, Jethro told Moses to ask permission of God to act in accordance with Jethro&#x2019;s counsel. This is what Jethro meant by <italic>and God command thee so</italic> (v. 23). There is no doubt that Moses did so.<sup><xref rid="fn3116">190</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BE THOU FOR THE PEOPLE.] The meaning of <italic>la-am</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3117">191</xref></sup> is, for the people.</p>
<p>BEFORE GOD. From God&#x2019;s side.<sup><xref rid="fn3118">192</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BRING THOU THE CAUSES UNTO GOD. If they be difficult. These are the things that Moses mentioned at first,<sup><xref rid="fn3119">193</xref></sup> viz., <italic>when they have a matter, it cometh unto me</italic> (v. 16). Jethro then explained this<sup><xref rid="fn3120">194</xref></sup> to him,<sup><xref rid="fn3121">195</xref></sup> viz., the hard causes they shall bring unto thee.</p>
<p>20. AND THOU SHALT TEACH THEM. As to the second thing you spoke of,<sup><xref rid="fn3122">196</xref></sup> you are obligated to teach and instruct them only those things that they are uncertain of. For it takes great effort to teach all, <italic>the work that they must do.</italic> Now as to the meaning of <italic>ve-hizharta</italic> (and thou shalt teach): <italic>ve-hizharta</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>nizhar</italic> in <italic>and took not warning</italic> (Ezek. 33:5). <italic>Nizhar</italic> means took warning.<sup><xref rid="fn3123">197</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEM. <italic>Ethem</italic> (them) is a compound of two words.<sup><xref rid="fn3124">198</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND THOU SHALT TEACH THEM.] You shall warn them<sup><xref rid="fn3125">199</xref></sup> to observe the positive and negative commandments that are tied to the heart,<sup><xref rid="fn3126">200</xref></sup> such as, to love God,<sup><xref rid="fn3127">201</xref></sup> to cleave unto God,<sup><xref rid="fn3128">202</xref></sup> to fear God,<sup><xref rid="fn3129">203</xref></sup> to walk after God,<sup><xref rid="fn3130">204</xref></sup> to circumcise the foreskin of the heart,<sup><xref rid="fn3131">205</xref></sup> not to hate one&#x2019;s brother,<sup><xref rid="fn3132">206</xref></sup> not to take revenge,<sup><xref rid="fn3133">207</xref></sup> and not to bear a grudge.<sup><xref rid="fn3134">208</xref></sup> They are the most important commandments. Moses similarly said, [<italic>But the word is very nigh unto thee</italic>] <italic>in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it</italic> (Deut. 30:14).<sup><xref rid="fn3135">209</xref></sup> There many such precepts.</p>
<p>THEY MUST WALK. <italic>Yelekhu bah</italic> means wherein they must walk.</p>
<p>AND THE WORK THAT THEY MUST DO. The reference is to positive precepts which are observed by action. Most of them are not positive commandments that stand by themselves<sup><xref rid="fn3136">210</xref></sup> but serve as a reminder, such as the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn3137">211</xref></sup> the Festivals,<sup><xref rid="fn3138">212</xref></sup> the redemption of the first-born,<sup><xref rid="fn3139">213</xref></sup> loving the stranger,<sup><xref rid="fn3140">214</xref></sup> the fringes,<sup><xref rid="fn3141">215</xref></sup> the <italic>tefillin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3142">216</xref></sup> the <italic>mezuzah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3143">217</xref></sup> and also the prohibition against mixing linen and wool,<sup><xref rid="fn3144">218</xref></sup> and many others.<sup><xref rid="fn3145">219</xref></sup> I will explain them in their place.</p>
<p>21. MOREOVER THOU SHALT PROVIDE. I have already informed you that the speakers of Hebrew do not preserve exact wording. They only preserve meanings.<sup><xref rid="fn3146">220</xref></sup> Hence, as I will yet explain, we will not pay attention to whether the text is full or deficient.<sup><xref rid="fn3147">221</xref></sup> Now when Moses recounted this incident,<sup><xref rid="fn3148">222</xref></sup> in place of <italic>able men</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3149">223</xref></sup> he said, <italic>Get you&#x2026;men</italic> (Deut. 1:13).<sup><xref rid="fn3150">224</xref></sup> Men in the latter verse has the same meaning as men in <italic>Choose us out men</italic> (Ex. 17:9) and in <italic>all of them men</italic> (Num. 13:3).<sup><xref rid="fn3151">225</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jethro said appoint men.</p>
<p>SUCH AS FEAR GOD. Who do not fear men but fear only God. It was to them that Moses was referring when he said,<sup><xref rid="fn3152">226</xref></sup> <italic>wise&#x2026;and understanding</italic> (Deut. 1:13).<sup><xref rid="fn3153">227</xref></sup> For it is not possible for one to be a fearer of heaven unless one be wise.</p>
<p>Jethro continued:</p>
<p>MEN OF TRUTH. Who do not lie.</p>
<p>HATING UNJUST GAIN (<italic>betza</italic>). Money.<sup><xref rid="fn3154">228</xref></sup> People who appear so, and are known as such by the community. It was in reference to these that Moses said, <italic>and known</italic> (Deut. 1:3).<sup><xref rid="fn3155">229</xref></sup></p>
<p>RULERS OF THOUSANDS. One may wonder: If the meaning of the term rulers is here to be taken literally, then their number comes to more that seventy-nine thousand.<sup><xref rid="fn3156">230</xref></sup> Now, it is extremely far-fetched for there to have been so many rulers. Indeed, Scripture states, <italic>For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof</italic> (Prov. 28:2).<sup><xref rid="fn3157">231</xref></sup> Furthermore, how is it possible for an eighth of the camp to be heads of the tribes? For this is what Moses said, that is, <italic>So I took the heads of your tribes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3158">232</xref></sup> (Deut. 1:15). Additionally, how is it possible that all of the above-mentioned virtues<sup><xref rid="fn3159">233</xref></sup> were found in these people who came out of Egypt and learned their ways? Indeed, Scripture states, <italic>After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do</italic> (Lev. 18:3).<sup><xref rid="fn3160">234</xref></sup> Now the desert generation, who were taught by Moses for forty years, did not have to work, for their bread was freely given and their water faithfully delivered. The manna, which they were not in the habit of eating in Egypt, in contrast to the types of food which they desired,<sup><xref rid="fn3161">235</xref></sup> instilled wisdom. Nevertheless, Moses told this generation at the end of forty years, <italic>but the Lord hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day</italic> (Deut. 29:3). We are thus amazed as to how it was possible to find the above-noted number<sup><xref rid="fn3162">236</xref></sup> of wise and understanding men.<sup><xref rid="fn3163">237</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that <italic>the rulers of thousands</italic> were men who had under them a thousand people, namely, slaves, young men, or hired hands. It is possible that these were the heads of the tribes and that they numbered twelve. The rulers of hundreds were many. The rulers of fifties were so called after the manner of <italic>and fifty men to run before him</italic> (II Sam. 15:1).<sup><xref rid="fn3164">238</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND LET THEM JUDGE THE PEOPLE. When the people have a matter. What they do not know how to judge you will judge. If you do not know it, then <italic>bring thou the causes unto God</italic> (v. 19).</p>
<p>[23. THEN THOU SHALT BE ABLE.] The <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>ve-yakholta</italic> (then thou shalt be able)<sup><xref rid="fn3165">239</xref></sup> is like the Arabic <italic>fah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3166">240</xref></sup> If you do this thing, and God grants you permission to do it, then you will be able to endure. Now the word <italic>amod</italic> (endure) is an infinitive. It is like the word <italic>amod</italic> (stand)<sup><xref rid="fn3167">241</xref></sup> in <italic>Stand in the door of the tent</italic> (Jud. 4:20). <italic>Peshotah</italic> (strip you) <italic>ve-orah</italic> (and make you bare), <italic>va-chagorah</italic> (and gird) in <italic>Strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your lions</italic> (Is. 32:11) are also infinitives.</p>
<p>[AND ALL THIS PEOPLE ALSO SHALL GO TO THEIR PLACE IN PEACE.] Its meaning is, when some the disputants who were standing before Moses were not able to present their cases before him<sup><xref rid="fn3168">242</xref></sup> for adjudication, their conflict intensified when they returned to their tents. However, now<sup><xref rid="fn3169">243</xref></sup> each one would return to his place, that is, his tent, in peace.</p>
<p>24. [SO MOSES HEARKENED.] Scripture mentions Jethro&#x2019;s council but does not mention Moses&#x2019; council.<sup><xref rid="fn3170">244</xref></sup> Moses added to Jethro&#x2019;s council: that is, Moses placed officers over the tribes to enforce the decrees of the judges. Scripture thus reads, <italic>and officers, tribe by tribe</italic> (Deut. 1:15), and <italic>Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates</italic> (Deut. 16:18).</p>
<p>25. AND MOSES CHOSE ABLE MEN. This thing was ascertainable. <italic>Such as fear God</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3171">245</xref></sup> is not mentioned, for only God knows what is in a person&#x2019;s heart. Moses said that he chose wise men for us, for he was able to ascertain this. However, there are wise men who are not God-fearing. Moses mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn3172">246</xref></sup> men <italic>who are known</italic> (Deut. 1:13),<sup><xref rid="fn3173">247</xref></sup> that is, men whom people recognize. He did not mention them here because he was being brief.</p>
<p>26. THEY JUDGED THEMSELVES. <italic>Yishputu</italic> (judged) means the same as <italic>yishpotu</italic> (judged).<sup><xref rid="fn3174">248</xref></sup> A <italic>shuruk</italic> has been substituted for a <italic>cholam</italic> in <italic>yishputu.</italic> It is similar to <italic>lo ta&#x2019;avuri</italic> (neither pass) in <italic>neither pass from hence</italic> (Ruth 2:5), which has the same meaning as <italic>ve-lo ta&#x2019;avori</italic> (and neither pass).<sup><xref rid="fn3175">249</xref></sup> However, Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn3176">250</xref></sup> wanted to distinguish between them<sup><xref rid="fn3177">251</xref></sup> but was unable to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn3178">252</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now from a grammatical standpoint the following may be said. We find the terms <italic>chadelu</italic> (ceased)<sup><xref rid="fn3179">253</xref></sup> and <italic>chadellu</italic> (ceased) with a <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>lamed</italic> because it is marked with an <italic>etnach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3180">254</xref></sup> in <italic>The rulers ceased</italic> (chadelu) <italic>in Israel, they ceased</italic> (chadellu) (Jud. 5:7). We similarly find the word <italic>nazollu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3181">255</xref></sup> (quake) at the end of a verse in <italic>That the mountains may quake</italic> (Is. 63:19). Scripture likewise reads, <italic>tehatellu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3182">256</xref></sup> <italic>vo</italic> (will ye mock him) (Job 13:9) since <italic>tehatellu</italic> is considered<sup><xref rid="fn3183">257</xref></sup> to be the last word in the sentence because it is connected to the word <italic>vo,</italic> which has only one vowel. Similarly, <italic>yishpetu hem</italic> is like <italic>yishputu</italic> (hem),<sup><xref rid="fn3184">258</xref></sup> for one can say<sup><xref rid="fn3185">259</xref></sup> that the <italic>etnach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3186">260</xref></sup> does not have the same power that the end of the verse has. Observe the word <italic>yippelu</italic> (fall) in <italic>The peoples fall under thee</italic> (Ps. 45:6); <italic>yeminekha</italic> (thy right hand) in <italic>The Lord at thy right hand</italic> (Ps. 110:5); <italic>avdekha</italic> (thy servant) in <italic>Thou hast dealt well with Thy servant</italic> (Ps. 119:65)<sup><xref rid="fn3187">261</xref></sup> and many other such instances. We do not find this to be the case at the close of a verse.<sup><xref rid="fn3188">262</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND MOSES LET HIS FATHER-IN-LAW DEPART. With respect,<sup><xref rid="fn3189">263</xref></sup> as in <italic>and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way</italic> (Gen. 18:16).<sup><xref rid="fn3190">264</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2927"><sup>1</sup> Short for Abraham. I.E. used the short form because of metrical reasons which are not apparent in translation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2928"><sup>2</sup> Cf. <italic>For He hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me</italic> (Job 30:11). The bow is a symbol of power. I.E. here indicates that he himself has passed the prime of life and has grown weak and weary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2929"><sup>3</sup> Of his courage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2930"><sup>4</sup> The above interpretations of the word <italic>yitro</italic> as meaning both <italic>bowstring</italic> and <italic>the rest.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3002"><sup>76</sup> Jer. 23:6 reads, <italic>ve-zah shemo asher yikre&#x2019;o Adonai-tzidkenu.</italic> I.E. renders this clause: and this is the name whereby he shall be called: <italic>Adonai-tzidkenu</italic> (The Lord is our righteousness).

<ftnote id="fn3003"><sup>77</sup> I.E. does not identify him. However, the thrust of his words is clear. The cantillical have a comma after the word <italic>yikre&#x2019;o.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3006"><sup>80</sup> That is, Gen. 12:8 is to read, <italic>va-yikra, be-shem, Adonai.</italic> The latter is to be translated: And he, Abraham, proclaimed the name of the Lord.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3156"><sup>230</sup> The Israelites numbered <italic>six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men</italic> (Ex. 38:26). The number of rulers over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens of such a group comes to 79,650 (Krinsky).</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER 19</title>
<p>1. IN THE THIRD MONTH. We do not know the meaning of <italic>the same day</italic> (ba-yom ha-zeh)<sup><xref rid="fn3191">1</xref></sup> unless the interpretation of Rabbi Moses<sup><xref rid="fn3192">2</xref></sup> to the effect that it<sup><xref rid="fn3193">3</xref></sup> refers to the new moon is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn3194">4</xref></sup> It is like <italic>Tomorrow is the new moon</italic> (I Sam 20:18).<sup><xref rid="fn3195">5</xref></sup> Scripture notes this<sup><xref rid="fn3196">6</xref></sup> because the Torah was given a few days after Israel camped.<sup><xref rid="fn3197">7</xref></sup> Perhaps Moses went up to God<sup><xref rid="fn3198">8</xref></sup> on day one<sup><xref rid="fn3199">9</xref></sup> and then came down and spoke to Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3200">10</xref></sup> Then on the third day of the month he went up again to report the words of the people to God.<sup><xref rid="fn3201">11</xref></sup> It was then told to Moses that the giving of the Torah would take place on the third day.<sup><xref rid="fn3202">12</xref></sup> All of this is by way of logical exegesis because we accept the tradition<sup><xref rid="fn3203">13</xref></sup> that the Torah was given on the sixth day of Sivan.<sup><xref rid="fn3204">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the rules of the calendar, if<sup><xref rid="fn3205">15</xref></sup> a day was not added to the month of Iyyar,<sup><xref rid="fn3206">16</xref></sup> then the Torah was given on a Friday.<sup><xref rid="fn3207">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that Scripture reads, <italic>the same day</italic> because the distance<sup><xref rid="fn3208">18</xref></sup> from Rephidim and Mount Sinai was greater than the distance between each journey.<sup><xref rid="fn3209">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND WHEN THEY WERE DEPARTED FROM REPHIDIM.<sup><xref rid="fn3210">20</xref></sup> Its meaning is, they had already departed from Rephidim.<sup><xref rid="fn3211">21</xref></sup> I have pointed out to you many other such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn3212">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEY ENCAMPED IN THE WILDERNESS. The previously mentioned wilderness of Sinai.</p>
<p>[AND THERE ISRAEL ENCAMPED.] Scripture reads, <italic>and there Israel encamped,</italic> after stating, <italic>they encamped in the wilderness,</italic> because the heads of the tribes and the elders camped before the mountain due to their respected positions.<sup><xref rid="fn3213">23</xref></sup> As I will explain,<sup><xref rid="fn3214">24</xref></sup> Israel stood around the mountain, in accordance with their status, on the day the Torah was given. Scripture uses the singular form <italic>va-yichan</italic> (encamped) because they<sup><xref rid="fn3215">25</xref></sup> were few in number. Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn3216">26</xref></sup> says that <italic>before</italic> (mi-neged) <italic>the mount</italic> means on the eastern side of the mountain. However, Scripture states, <italic>a good way off</italic> (mineged) <italic>shall they pitch, round about</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3217">27</xref></sup> <italic>the tent of meeting</italic> (Num. 2:2), namely, on all sides of the tent of meeting. For<sup><xref rid="fn3218">28</xref></sup> as the standards journeyed,<sup><xref rid="fn3219">29</xref></sup> so did they camp.<sup><xref rid="fn3220">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND MOSES WENT UP UNTO GOD. Scripture above reads, <italic>before the mount</italic> (v. 2). Its meaning thus is: and Moses went up to the mount of God.<sup><xref rid="fn3221">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND THE LORD CALLED UNTO HIM.] Its meaning is,<sup><xref rid="fn3222">32</xref></sup> and the Lord had already called him.<sup><xref rid="fn3223">33</xref></sup> For Moses would not have ascended without permission.</p>
<p>[OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN.] Scripture says this<sup><xref rid="fn3224">34</xref></sup> becauce Moses did not ascend above the mountain.<sup><xref rid="fn3225">35</xref></sup> For the Lord spoke to Moses on the mountain. Do not be bothered by the fact that Scripture afterwards states, <italic>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai</italic> (v. 20),<sup><xref rid="fn3226">36</xref></sup> for the Torah says this from the point of view of Israel when they beheld the cloud and fire. Scripture explicitly states, <italic>and thou didst hear His words out of the midst of the fire</italic> (Deut. 4:36).<sup><xref rid="fn3227">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>[SAYING.]<sup><xref rid="fn3228">38</xref></sup> Its meaning is that the Lord<sup><xref rid="fn3229">39</xref></sup> called Moses to tell him: <italic>Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob</italic>). The meaning is, say something relating to all of<sup><xref rid="fn3230">40</xref></sup> the house of Jacob, to those alive today and to their children after them.</p>
<p>[AND TELL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] The reference is to the elders. The elders will then tell all of the people.<sup><xref rid="fn3231">41</xref></sup> We thus read, <italic>And Moses came and called for the elders of the people</italic> (v. 7),<sup><xref rid="fn3232">42</xref></sup> and it is then written, <italic>And all the people answered together</italic> (v. 8).</p>
<p>[HOUSE.] I have previously explained the meaning of the word house (Ex. 1:1).</p>
<p>4. YE HAVE SEEN. The vengeance that I executed upon the Egyptians on your behalf, and that I bore you out of Egypt as if you were carried on the wings of eagles. For an eagle flies higher in the air than any other bird. All birds are afraid of him and he fears no bird.</p>
<p>[I BORE YOU ON EAGLES&#x2019; WINGS.] Moses employed a similar metaphor later on when he said, <italic>As an eagle that stirreth up her nest</italic> (Deut. 32:11),<sup><xref rid="fn3233">43</xref></sup> that is, it slowly leads its young.<sup><xref rid="fn3234">44</xref></sup> Moses similarly referred to the clouds<sup><xref rid="fn3235">45</xref></sup> when he said, <italic>Spreadeth abroad her wings</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>AND BROUGHT YOU UNTO MYSELF. In that God&#x2019;s glory came down upon this mountain. This is the holy mountain referred to by Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn3236">46</xref></sup> Now Moses said,<sup><xref rid="fn3237">47</xref></sup> <italic>ye shall serve God upon this mountain</italic> (Ex. 3:12). The latter is the same as <italic>Thy holy habitation</italic> (Ex. 15:13).<sup><xref rid="fn3238">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. NOW THEREFORE, IF YE WILL HEARKEN UNTO MY VOICE. To observe my commandments and keep the covenant which I will make with you. The reference, as I will explain with irrefutable proofs in the proper place,<sup><xref rid="fn3239">49</xref></sup> is to the covenant made by Moses with Israel after the giving of the Torah, when he built the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn3240">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>[TREASURE.] The word <italic>segullah</italic> (treasure) means something precious, lovely, and unique.</p>
<p>[FOR ALL THE EARTH IS MINE.] This is connected to <italic>all peoples</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3241">51</xref></sup> The clause is to be interpreted: for all the peoples of the earth are mine. This is what Scripture means by <italic>and</italic> [I] <italic>set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine</italic> (Lev. 20:26).<sup><xref rid="fn3242">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Merinus says that <italic>ki li kol ha-aretz</italic> (for all the earth is mine) means: even though all the earth is mine.<sup><xref rid="fn3243">53</xref></sup> I believe that this is the case with <italic>ki am keseh oref attah</italic> (it is a stiffnecked people) (Ex. 32:9)<sup><xref rid="fn3244">54</xref></sup> and <italic>refah nafshi ki chatati lakh</italic> (Heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee) (Ps. 41:5).<sup><xref rid="fn3245">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND MOSES CAME. To the camp of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3246">56</xref></sup> There is no need to mention that Moses descended.<sup><xref rid="fn3247">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SET BEFORE THEM. As in <italic>And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel</italic> (Deut. 4:44).<sup><xref rid="fn3248">58</xref></sup> However, the Gaon says that the word set is used here in the same way as the word set in <italic>set</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3249">59</xref></sup> <italic>it in their mouths</italic> (Deut. 31:19). The reference<sup><xref rid="fn3250">60</xref></sup> is to the oral law which explains the written law.<sup><xref rid="fn3251">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. TOGETHER. The word <italic>yachdav</italic> (together) is grammatically unique<sup><xref rid="fn3252">62</xref></sup> in Scripture because of the added <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3253">63</xref></sup> Yefet explains it to mean alone, by oneself, without anybody else there.<sup><xref rid="fn3254">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>[REPORTED.] Scripture mentions, <italic>and Moses reported,</italic> but has no need to mention that Moses went up<sup><xref rid="fn3255">65</xref></sup> because Scripture is being brief.</p>
<p>9. AND THE LORD SAID. What reason is there for saying, <italic>And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord</italic> (v. 9) after having said,<sup><xref rid="fn3256">66</xref></sup> <italic>And Moses reported the words of the people unto the Lord</italic>? Note that there are many verses in the Torah that should have come earlier.<sup><xref rid="fn3257">67</xref></sup> Their meaning is that such and such already took place.<sup><xref rid="fn3258">68</xref></sup> For example, the meaning of <italic>va-yitzar</italic> (formed) in, <italic>Then the Lord God formed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3259">69</xref></sup> (Gen. 2:7) is, He<sup><xref rid="fn3260">70</xref></sup> had already formed;<sup><xref rid="fn3261">71</xref></sup> the meaning of <italic>va-yatzmach</italic> (made to grow) in <italic>And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow</italic> (Gen. 2:9) is, He had already made to grow;<sup><xref rid="fn3262">72</xref></sup> the meaning of <italic>va-yomer</italic> (and said) in <italic>and said: Whose daughter art thou?</italic> (Gen. 24:23) is, and he<sup><xref rid="fn3263">73</xref></sup> had already said.<sup><xref rid="fn3264">74</xref></sup> Indeed, Scripture explicitly states,<sup><xref rid="fn3265">75</xref></sup> <italic>And I asked her, and said</italic> (Gen. 24:47),<sup><xref rid="fn3266">76</xref></sup> and then,<sup><xref rid="fn3267">77</xref></sup> <italic>I put the ring upon her nose</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). Similarly, the meaning of <italic>And she</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3268">78</xref></sup> <italic>said unto the servant</italic> (Gen. 24:65) is, and she had already said unto the servant,<sup><xref rid="fn3269">79</xref></sup> and then, <italic>she alighted from the camel</italic> (Gen. 24:64).<sup><xref rid="fn3270">80</xref></sup> There is no need to elaborate.<sup><xref rid="fn3271">81</xref></sup> Now the meaning of <italic>And Moses told</italic> here<sup><xref rid="fn3272">82</xref></sup> is, and Moses had already told. Scripture does not mention what Moses told.<sup><xref rid="fn3273">83</xref></sup> The word <italic>higid</italic> (told) always refers to something new that has not previously been mentioned. It is thus not connected to <italic>and Moses reported</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3274">84</xref></sup> From God&#x2019;s answer to Moses, &#x201C;<italic>Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud</italic>&#x201D; (v. 9), we learn what Moses told.<sup><xref rid="fn3275">85</xref></sup> Furthermore, as I will explain,<sup><xref rid="fn3276">86</xref></sup> we find this clearly stated in Moses&#x2019; very words.</p>
<p>Note that the Egyptians and the Indians are from the children of Ham. Each one relies on the other.<sup><xref rid="fn3277">87</xref></sup> The people of India do not eat meat. The Egyptians used to do the same. They changed their practice only because the kingdom of Ishmael<sup><xref rid="fn3278">88</xref></sup> overpowered them and they accepted the religion of the Ishmaelites. The Indian sages offer proofs in accordance with their thinking that it is impossible for God to talk to a person and for that person to live. Now the Israelites were in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn3279">89</xref></sup> There were among them people who followed this belief.<sup><xref rid="fn3280">90</xref></sup> They were in doubt about Moses&#x2019; prophecy. <italic>And they believed in the Lord, and in His servant Moses</italic> (Ex. 14:31) does not dispute this.<sup><xref rid="fn3281">91</xref></sup> For Scripture reads, <italic>And Israel saw</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). It does not say: and all Israel saw.<sup><xref rid="fn3282">92</xref></sup> Even if it read, all of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn3283">93</xref></sup> it would speak of the majority as is the style of the language,<sup><xref rid="fn3284">94</xref></sup> as in <italic>and all the cattle of Egypt died</italic> (Ex. 9:6),<sup><xref rid="fn3285">95</xref></sup> which is followed by <italic>Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle</italic> (Ex. 9:19).<sup><xref rid="fn3286">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>[LO, I COME UNTO THEE.] This is to be understood as an answer to Moses, who told this<sup><xref rid="fn3287">97</xref></sup> to God.<sup><xref rid="fn3288">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN A THICK CLOUD.] When God will descend upon the mountain.</p>
<p>WHEN I SPEAK WITH THEE. The Decalogue. They will then believe that God in truth speaks with a person and he lives.</p>
<p>[AND MAY ALSO BELIEVE THEE.] That you are a prophet. All doubt will be removed from their minds. It is explicitly written, <italic>we have seen this day that God doth speak with man, and he liveth</italic> (Deut. 5:21). It is also written there, <italic>For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?</italic> (Deut. 5:23). And it is there written, <italic>Go thou near, and hear</italic> (Deut. 5:24).<sup><xref rid="fn3289">99</xref></sup> This is what Scripture means by <italic>and may also believe thee for ever.</italic></p>
<p>10. AND THE LORD SAID&#x2026;SANCTIFY THEM TO-DAY AND TOMORROW. Observe, God enlarged the time allotted for Israel&#x2019;s sanctification by giving them the rest of this day and the morrow.<sup><xref rid="fn3290">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND SANCTIFY THEM.] By washing in water. This is indicated by <italic>and let them wash their garments.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3291">101</xref></sup> Our verse is to be interpreted after the manner of <italic>But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh</italic> (Lev. 17:16). Moses therefore said, starting from now, <italic>come not near a woman</italic> (v. 15) so that they would be sanctified and not be unclean. One who drew near to a women should sanctify himself,<sup><xref rid="fn3292">102</xref></sup> as in <italic>for she was purified</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3293">103</xref></sup> <italic>from her uncleanliness</italic> (II Sam. 11:4).</p>
<p>11. AND BE READY. Its meaning might be that no person among them should sleep during the night, after the manner of the high priest on Yom Kippur,<sup><xref rid="fn3294">104</xref></sup> as Israel would hear God&#x2019;s voice in the morning.</p>
<p>12. AND THOU SHALT SET BOUNDS. Place a border on the mount.<sup><xref rid="fn3295">105</xref></sup> <italic>Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it</italic> (v. 23) is therefore similar.<sup><xref rid="fn3296">106</xref></sup> I dwell on this because the crazy one<sup><xref rid="fn3297">107</xref></sup> who inverted the words of the living God in his book<sup><xref rid="fn3298">108</xref></sup> said that Moses intended to say,<sup><xref rid="fn3299">109</xref></sup> set bounds about the people,<sup><xref rid="fn3300">110</xref></sup> but what came out of his mouth was &#x201C;the mount&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;the people.&#x201D;</p>
<p>WHOSOEVER TOUCHETH THE MOUNT. With his body.<sup><xref rid="fn3301">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. NO HAND SHALL TOUCH HIM. The word <italic>bo</italic> (him) refers to the person who touches the mount.<sup><xref rid="fn3302">112</xref></sup> It means that no one shall enter after him<sup><xref rid="fn3303">113</xref></sup> to grab him. On the contrary, those who see him shall immediately stone him from where they are standing or shall shoot him through with arrows if he be distant.</p>
<p>[SHOT THROUGH.] The word <italic>yiyareh</italic> (shot through) differs from its counterparts.<sup><xref rid="fn3304">114</xref></sup> For the rule pertaining to roots that have a <italic>yod</italic> as their first letter is that the <italic>yod</italic> changes to a <italic>vav</italic> in the <italic>nifal</italic> imperfect, as in the word <italic>yivvada</italic> (be known)<sup><xref rid="fn3305">115</xref></sup> in <italic>and the plenty shall not be known</italic> (Gen. 41:31) and <italic>va-ivvaser</italic> (and I was chastised)<sup><xref rid="fn3306">116</xref></sup> in <italic>Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised</italic> (Jer. 31:18). Perhaps they<sup><xref rid="fn3307">117</xref></sup> did this so that this root<sup><xref rid="fn3308">118</xref></sup> not be confused with the root of <italic>tivvare</italic> (thou mayest be feared)<sup><xref rid="fn3309">119</xref></sup> in <italic>That Thou mayest be feared</italic> (Ps. 130:4).<sup><xref rid="fn3310">120</xref></sup> For the <italic>alef</italic> and the <italic>heh</italic> are silent at the end of the word and there is no difference in pronunciation between them.<sup><xref rid="fn3311">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHETHER IT BE BEAST OR MAN, IT SHALL NOT LIVE. Not so a bird as it cannot be taken, for it immediately flies away.</p>
<p>WHEN THE RAM&#x2019;S HORN SOUNDETH LONG. <italic>Yovel</italic> (ram) is a lamb.<sup><xref rid="fn3312">122</xref></sup> Jubilee (<italic>yovel</italic>) is so called because Scripture states, <italic>Then shalt thou make proclamation with the blast of a shofar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3313">123</xref></sup> (Lev. 25:9), and the <italic>shofar</italic> is made from the horns of a lamb.<sup><xref rid="fn3314">124</xref></sup> It is similarly written, <italic>And it shall be, that when they make a long blast with the horn of the yovel,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3315">125</xref></sup> <italic>and when ye hear the sound of the shofar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3316">126</xref></sup> (Josh. 6:5).</p>
<p>One must wonder at those who say that <italic>And when the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke</italic> (v. 19) refers to <italic>when the ram&#x2019;s horn</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3317">127</xref></sup> <italic>soundeth long</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3318">128</xref></sup> For the voice of the horn<sup><xref rid="fn3319">129</xref></sup> was a great wonder;<sup><xref rid="fn3320">130</xref></sup> there was no greater wonder at that assembly around Mount Sinai. For sounds of thunder, lightning, and a thick cloud are also visible in the world. However, the voice of the horn<sup><xref rid="fn3321">131</xref></sup> was unheard of until the day of the Decalogue.<sup><xref rid="fn3322">132</xref></sup> Behold, the sound<sup><xref rid="fn3323">133</xref></sup> was not from the horn of a lamb.<sup><xref rid="fn3324">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHEN THE RAM&#x2019;S HORN SOUNDETH LONG, THEY SHALL COME UP TO THE MOUNT.] The Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn3325">135</xref></sup> says<sup><xref rid="fn3326">136</xref></sup> that when Moses sounds the horn it will give them permission to ascend.<sup><xref rid="fn3327">137</xref></sup> This took place after Moses descended<sup><xref rid="fn3328">138</xref></sup> on the Day of Atonement and commanded that the tabernacle be constructed</p>
<p>THEY SHALL COME UP TO THE MOUNT. Rabbi Samuel ben Hofni says that &#x201C;they&#x201D; refers to Aaron, Aaron&#x2019;s sons, and the seventy elders concerning whom it is written, <italic>And unto Moses He said: Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel</italic> (Ex. 24:1).<sup><xref rid="fn3329">139</xref></sup> However, Moses did not give permission to the rest of the people to ascend Mount Sinai. He therefore said &#x201C;they&#x201D; and not others. His words appear good in my sight. For the glory was continually on Sinai until the tabernacle was erected, as it is written, <italic>and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle</italic> (Ex. 4:34). God then spoke with Moses in the tent of meeting. Perhaps Moses then sounded the horn<sup><xref rid="fn3330">140</xref></sup> and now that the glory was gone,<sup><xref rid="fn3331">141</xref></sup> God gave him<sup><xref rid="fn3332">142</xref></sup> permission to ascend.<sup><xref rid="fn3333">143</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND MOSES WENT DOWN&#x2026;AND SANCTIFIED THE PEOPLE. As I have already explained.<sup><xref rid="fn3334">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. BE READY AGAINST THE THIRD DAY. The meaning of <italic>li-sheloshet yamim</italic> is, for the third day. According to the plain meaning of the text, Moses did not add a day by himself.<sup><xref rid="fn3335">145</xref></sup> I will bring two faithful witnesses,<sup><xref rid="fn3336">146</xref></sup> both of which are found in this book. Now it is written, <italic>And he put them all together into ward three days</italic> (sheloset yamim) (Gen. 42:17). It is then written, <italic>And Joseph said unto them the third day</italic> (yom ha-shelishi) (Gen. 42:18). Scripture also states, <italic>within yet three days</italic> (sheloshet yamim) <italic>shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee</italic> (Gen. 40:19). It is then written, <italic>And it came to pass the third day</italic> (ba-yom ha-shelishi) (Gen. 40:20).<sup><xref rid="fn3337">147</xref></sup> Similarly here, <italic>heyu nekhnim li-sheloshet yamim</italic> [means be ready for the third day].</p>
<p>16. AND A THICK CLOUD UPON THE MOUNT. Upon the mount alone. The same applies to the thunder and lightning.<sup><xref rid="fn3338">148</xref></sup></p>
<p>[EXCEEDING LOUD.] Its meaning is, louder than the voice of any <italic>shofar</italic> (horn) that they ever heard.</p>
<p>AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE CAMP TREMBLED. Because of the sound of the <italic>shofar</italic> (horn).</p>
<p>17. AND MOSES BROUGHT FORTH. Its meaning is: and Moses brought forth the people out of their tents<sup><xref rid="fn3339">149</xref></sup> to meet God and to accept the Lord who came down on Mount Sinai as their God.<sup><xref rid="fn3340">150</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY STOOD AT THE NETHER PART OF THE MOUNT. Outside of the boundary that Moses set for them. Now they stood at Mount Sinai in a manner similar to that in which Moses made their children stand at the end of forty years<sup><xref rid="fn3341">151</xref></sup> when he made a covenant with them.<sup><xref rid="fn3342">152</xref></sup> The first-born<sup><xref rid="fn3343">153</xref></sup> <italic>that</italic> [<italic>came</italic>] <italic>near the Lord</italic> were first, after them the heads of the tribes,<sup><xref rid="fn3344">154</xref></sup> namely, the princes, after them the elders, after them the officers, after them all the men of Israel;<sup><xref rid="fn3345">155</xref></sup> after them came the little ones,<sup><xref rid="fn3346">156</xref></sup> after them the women,<sup><xref rid="fn3347">157</xref></sup> and after them the proselytes.<sup><xref rid="fn3348">158</xref></sup> Moses and Aaron passed over the boundary and were on the mount close to the priests. This was so<sup><xref rid="fn3349">159</xref></sup> even though Scripture does not explicitly say so, as Scripture was brief. We know that they<sup><xref rid="fn3350">160</xref></sup> did not rebel against the word of God for, behold, it is written, <italic>Go, get thee down, and thou shalt come up,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3351">161</xref></sup> <italic>thou, and Aaron with thee</italic> (v. 24). Moses similarly said, <italic>I stood between the Lord and you</italic> (Deut. 5:5).<sup><xref rid="fn3352">162</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. NOW MOUNT SINAI WAS ALTOGETHER ON SMOKE. The <italic>shin</italic> of <italic>ashan</italic> (smoke) is vocalized with a long <italic>pattach</italic> because it is a verb in the perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn3353">163</xref></sup> Do not be surprised at the word for smoke<sup><xref rid="fn3354">164</xref></sup> since Scripture reads, <italic>ke-eshen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3355">165</xref></sup> <italic>ha-kivshan</italic> (as the smoke of the furnace) after saying, <italic>va-ya&#x2019;al ashano</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3356">166</xref></sup> (and the smoke thereof ascended). Note that <italic>ashano</italic> follows the form of <italic>shelalo</italic> (his spoil)<sup><xref rid="fn3357">167</xref></sup> and <italic>zehavo</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3358">168</xref></sup> (his gold),<sup><xref rid="fn3359">169</xref></sup> for nouns come in various forms each of which has a different name.<sup><xref rid="fn3360">170</xref></sup> Thus Scripture reads, <italic>shegar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3361">171</xref></sup> <italic>alafekha</italic> (the increase of thy kine) (Deut. 7:13), but elsewhere it reads, <italic>ve-khol peter sheger</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3362">172</xref></sup> <italic>be-hemah</italic> (every firstling that is male) (Ex. 13:12). Scripture reads, <italic>ve-et ha-bosem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3363">173</xref></sup> <italic>ve-et ha-shemen</italic> (and the spice, and the oil) (Ex. 35:28). However, we also find, <italic>ve-kinneman besem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3364">174</xref></sup> (and of cinnamon spice)<sup><xref rid="fn3365">175</xref></sup> (Ex. 30:23). Furthermore, Scripture reads, <italic>ariti mori im besami</italic> (I have gathered my myrrh with my spice) (Cant. 5:1). Now, if <italic>besami</italic> (my spice) was derived from <italic>bosem</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3366">176</xref></sup> the word should have been vocalized with a <italic>chataf kamatz</italic> and be pronounced <italic>bosmi</italic> like the word <italic>kodshi</italic> (my holy object), which is derived from <italic>kodesh</italic> (holy).<sup><xref rid="fn3367">177</xref></sup> Similarly, if <italic>besami</italic> was derived from <italic>besem</italic> (sweet)<sup><xref rid="fn3368">178</xref></sup> in <italic>and of cinnamon spice</italic> (Ex. 30:23), then <italic>besami</italic> should have been vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic> like the word <italic>shamni</italic> (my oil),<sup><xref rid="fn3369">179</xref></sup> which is derived from <italic>shemen</italic> (oil), or with a <italic>chirik</italic> like the word <italic>tzidki</italic> (my righteousness),<sup><xref rid="fn3370">180</xref></sup> which is derived from <italic>tzedek</italic> (righteous). The word <italic>besami</italic> minus the <italic>yod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3371">181</xref></sup> is thus vocalized with two <italic>kematzim</italic> and pronounced <italic>basam</italic> (spice),<sup><xref rid="fn3372">182</xref></sup> like the word <italic>shalal</italic> (spoil) and the word <italic>zahav</italic> (gold).</p>
<p>AND THE WHOLE MOUNT QUAKED GREATLY. The reverse of the usual, for mountains do not move. It is only by way of parable that Scripture states, <italic>And the hills did tremble</italic> (Is. 5:25).</p>
<p>19. AND WHEN THE VOICE OF THE HORN WAXED LOUDER AND LOUDER. The normal thing is for the sound of the <italic>shofar</italic> to be stronger when first sounded.<sup><xref rid="fn3373">183</xref></sup> However, the reverse was the case here.<sup><xref rid="fn3374">184</xref></sup> Perhaps God made it sound weaker at the beginning so that Israel would not lose heart out of fright.</p>
<p>MOSES SPOKE. According to Saadiah Gaon, God periodically stopped the sound of the <italic>shofar,</italic> at which time Moses spoke<sup><xref rid="fn3375">185</xref></sup> with a loud voice. God then answered Moses with a voice, as in <italic>then he</italic> [Moses] <italic>heard the Voice speaking unto him</italic> (Num. 7:89). It is concerning this that Scripture states, <italic>that the people may hear when I speak with thee</italic> (v. 9). However, I have already told you<sup><xref rid="fn3376">186</xref></sup> that in my opinion, <italic>when I speak with thee</italic> refers to the Decalogue.<sup><xref rid="fn3377">187</xref></sup> <italic>Moses spoke</italic> is to be explained by connecting it to <italic>the voice of the horn</italic> (shofar). Moses&#x2019; soul cleaved unto God.<sup><xref rid="fn3378">188</xref></sup> Moses spoke with God from the foot of the mountain and asked something of God. However, Scripture does not reveal what Moses asked. God answered Moses with a voice audible to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn3379">189</xref></sup> The sound of the <italic>shofar,</italic> although very loud, did not prevent Moses from hearing the voice. Because of this,<sup><xref rid="fn3380">190</xref></sup> Scripture states afterwards, <italic>and the Lord called Moses</italic> with the sound of a voice and told him to ascend the mountain where the glory of God was.</p>
<p>20. AND THE LORD CAME DOWN. I will now convey a general principle that will satisfy you<sup><xref rid="fn3381">191</xref></sup> until, with God&#x2019;s help, I will come to the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa,</italic> where I will explain extremely deep things to you very clearly. Know that man&#x2019;s soul is extolled and glorious. It comes from the middle world.<sup><xref rid="fn3382">192</xref></sup> However, man&#x2019;s body comes from the inferior world. The only one in this inferior world who has the ability to speak is man. Likewise the hearer, that is, the person to whom the speaker wants to convey what is in the speaker&#x2019;s heart.<sup><xref rid="fn3383">193</xref></sup> An intelligent person cannot invent speech.<sup><xref rid="fn3384">194</xref></sup> He must employ the language that is known and used. All languages are built upon the arrangement of the human form,<sup><xref rid="fn3385">195</xref></sup> which is made up of an incorporeal soul and a body made out of four elements.<sup><xref rid="fn3386">196</xref></sup> Now when a person speaks to a fellow human being in a language that the latter knows, he understands the speaker&#x2019;s words and their forms in their arrangements. If one wants to speak of things that are on a lower level than human beings, he has to raise their level and give them human form so that anyone who hears him will understand his words. Hence they<sup><xref rid="fn3387">197</xref></sup> attributed a head to the earth, as in <italic>The head of the dust of the world</italic> (Prov. 8:26),<sup><xref rid="fn3388">198</xref></sup> a mouth to the earth, as in <italic>And the earth opened her mouth</italic> (Num. 16:32), and a side, as in <italic>from the sides of the earth</italic> (Jer. 6:22).<sup><xref rid="fn3389">199</xref></sup> We similarly find, the <italic>head of the Jordan</italic> (Num. 13:29)<sup><xref rid="fn3390">200</xref></sup> and <italic>in the heart of the sea</italic> (Ex. 15:8). There are many such instances. Now they are all metaphoric, for the sea has no heart. Furthermore, they picture one part of the body as if it had the form of the entire body. Thus Scripture says, <italic>Death and life are in the hand of the tongue</italic> (Prov. 18:21).<sup><xref rid="fn3391">201</xref></sup> There are many such cases.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a person wants to speak of things more important than he, namely, of things from the upper world, he brings them down to his level and anthropomorphizes them, speaking of them as if they had human form. All this is done so that the hearer can be understood. Scripture thus reads, <italic>the man Gabriel</italic> (Dan. 9:21).<sup><xref rid="fn3392">202</xref></sup> Scripture similarly speaks of <italic>his</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3393">203</xref></sup> <italic>arms and his feet</italic> (Dan. 10:6) and tells us, <italic>and the voice of his</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3394">204</xref></sup> <italic>words</italic> [was] <italic>like the voice of a multitude</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). They [the writers of Scripture] took hold of this style of speech when describing the Most High. Scripture thus states, <italic>And a helmet of salvation upon His</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3395">205</xref></sup> <italic>head</italic> (Is. 59:17); <italic>For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken</italic> (Is. 1:20); <italic>The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous, And His ears are open unto their cry; The face of the Lord is against them that do evil</italic> (Ps. 34:16,17); and <italic>and there was under His feet</italic> (Ex. 24:10). This is the way to understand <italic>And the Lord came down</italic> (Gen. 11:5) and, <italic>and God went up</italic> (Gen. 17:22), for everything is full of His glory.<sup><xref rid="fn3396">206</xref></sup> I will present a parable in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic> through which you will be able to understand what Scripture means by God ascending and descending.<sup><xref rid="fn3397">207</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND THE LORD CALLED MOSES TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNT.] The reason the Lord called Moses<sup><xref rid="fn3398">208</xref></sup> was so that Israel would see Moses&#x2019; greatly elevated state, namely, that he reached the top of the mountain where there was the glory of God, whose words the people would hear from the fire that was there.</p>
<p>21. GO DOWN, CHARGE THE PEOPLE, LEST THEY BREAK THROUGH. Each one from the place<sup><xref rid="fn3399">209</xref></sup> where he stands, thinking that they are rendering Me honor because of their great desire to gaze at My glory. Moses therefore said, <italic>to gaze</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3400">210</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE PEOPLE.] The term <italic>ba-am</italic> (the people)<sup><xref rid="fn3401">211</xref></sup> is to be read as if written twice. Our verse is to be read as if written: and shall fall from them, many people.<sup><xref rid="fn3402">212</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND LET THE PRIESTS ALSO. The reference is to the first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn3403">213</xref></sup> Though the first-born are holy, as it is written, <italic>sanctify unto Me all the first-born</italic> (Ex. 13:2) nevertheless, let them add to their holiness by sanctifying themselves through their thoughts.</p>
<p>[THAT COME NEAR THE LORD.] Who are at the beginning of the boundary.<sup><xref rid="fn3404">214</xref></sup> Or its meaning is,<sup><xref rid="fn3405">215</xref></sup> who offered burnt offerings upon the altar that Moses built after Amalek was vanquished,<sup><xref rid="fn3406">216</xref></sup> and who also will offer sacrifices on the altar of the covenant that Moses built and fixed beneath the mountain where Israel stood to hear the voice of God.<sup><xref rid="fn3407">217</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD: THE PEOPLE CANNOT COME UP TO MOUNT SINAI. Saadiah says that he contemplated this verse for many years and could not understand its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn3408">218</xref></sup> until he came across a book dealing with the customs of the Persian kings in which it is stated that a king&#x2019;s messenger does not have permission to tell the king that he has accomplished his mission until the king commands him to do another task. Only then may he tell the king.<sup><xref rid="fn3409">219</xref></sup> However, I believe that because God<sup><xref rid="fn3410">220</xref></sup> told Moses, <italic>lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze,</italic> Moses did not know whether he had to warn the people not to gaze.<sup><xref rid="fn3411">221</xref></sup> He had already warned them<sup><xref rid="fn3412">222</xref></sup> that they were not to pass the boundary.<sup><xref rid="fn3413">223</xref></sup> God then told Moses, <italic>Go, get thee down</italic> and charge them as I commanded you.<sup><xref rid="fn3414">224</xref></sup> For Israel needed to be charged a second time.<sup><xref rid="fn3415">225</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND THOU SHALT COME UP, THOU, AND AARON WITH THEE. A little above the boundary so as not to be too far from Israel, because after God finishes speaking the Decalogue, Israel will say to you, <italic>Speak thou with us, and we will hear</italic> (Ex. 20:16).</p>
<p>I will now give the Gaon the answer to his question.<sup><xref rid="fn3416">226</xref></sup> God did not tell Moses to charge Israel not to gaze upon Him.<sup><xref rid="fn3417">227</xref></sup> He told Moses<sup><xref rid="fn3418">228</xref></sup> to charge the people<sup><xref rid="fn3419">229</xref></sup> not to pass over the boundary. For it was necessary to charge them at the very time of God&#x2019;s revelation to listen and guard their lives.</p>
<p>25. SO MOSES WENT DOWN UNTO THE PEOPLE, AND TOLD THEM. When Moses finished telling the people,<sup><xref rid="fn3420">230</xref></sup> he and Aaron went up the mountain beyond the border whereupon God immediately began to speak.</p>

Cf. <italic>Sabbath</italic> 86b: &#x201C;The Decalogue was given on the sixth (of the month of Sivan). Rabbi Jose says on the seventh.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3205"><sup>15</sup> For some reason.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3206"><sup>16</sup> In other words, if Iyyar had 29 days as it usually does.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3207"><sup>17</sup> According to the rabbis of the Talmud (<italic>Sabbath</italic> 87b), Israel left Egypt on a Thursday. Now if the new moon at that time was not consecrated by observation but rather by following the rules of the Hebrew calendar, then the sixth of Sivan had to fall on a Friday.

<ftnote id="fn3209"><sup>19</sup> In other words, <italic>the same day</italic> refers to the day that they left Rephidim. Our verse thus tells us that Israel came to the wilderness of Sinai on the same day that they left Rephidim. Scripture notes this because unlike the other journeys, which were normally a day&#x2019;s journey apart, Rephidim and Sinai were far apart. Yet Israel made the journey in one day. From this comment it is clear that I.E. had serious doubts about whether <italic>ba-chodesh ha-shelishi</italic> really means on the first day of the third month.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3210"><sup>20</sup> Literally, <italic>And they departed from Rephidim.</italic> Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3211"><sup>21</sup> Verse 1 tells us that Israel came to the wilderness of Sinai. Thus, <italic>And they departed from Rephidim</italic> is out of place here, for Israel departed from Rephidim before they came to Sinai. Hence <italic>va-yisu</italic> is to be rendered: and they had already departed, rather than: and they departed. J.P.S. translates accordingly.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3217"><sup>27</sup> We thus see that the word <italic>neged</italic> (before) does not mean east, for Scripture goes on to say, <italic>round about</italic> (saviv). Hence the word <italic>neged</italic> can refer to any direction.</ftnote>

The verse is to be understood as follows: And Moses told the words of the people to God; that is, Moses told God that some Israelites doubted that the Lord speaks to any human being. God answered, <italic>Lo I come unto thee in a thick cloud,</italic> etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3289"><sup>99</sup> The word of God and report it back to us. Israel said this to Moses.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3295"><sup>105</sup> The Biblical text reads, <italic>And thou shalt set bounds</italic> (ve-higbalta) <italic>unto the people.</italic> I.E. interprets this to mean: And thou shalt set bounds on the mount beyond which the people may not cross.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3296"><sup>106</sup> For it repeats what is implied in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3297"><sup>107</sup> Some identify him with Isaac, son of Solomon Israeli (850-950), a court physician to the caliphs of Egypt and Kairouan. He was a philosopher, Bible commentator, and physician. Shadal identifies him with Jonah ibn Janach.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3299"><sup>109</sup> In verse 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3300"><sup>110</sup> As in our verse. This commentator obviously held that <italic>And thou shalt set bounds unto the people</italic> does not mean: and thou shalt set bounds on the mountain. He wanted to harmonize our verse and verse 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3301"><sup>111</sup> One is not only prohibited from touching the mountain by hand, as verse 13 may be taken to imply, but any contact with the mountain is prohibited (Weiser). Filwarg interprets: one is only prohibited from physically touching the mountain. However, one may cast an object upon it. See next verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3302"><sup>112</sup> The word <italic>bo</italic> also means &#x201C;it.&#x201D; Thus our verse may be taken to mean, no hand shall touch it, that is, the mountain (see previous note). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3303"><sup>113</sup> The one who crosses the boundary and thus touches the mount.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3304"><sup>114</sup> Other stems which have a <italic>yod</italic> as their first letter. The root of <italic>yiyareh</italic> is <italic>yod, resh, heh.</italic></ftnote>

Hence in one the <italic>yod</italic> changed into a <italic>vav,</italic> as is the rule, and in the other the <italic>yod</italic> remained unchanged.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3311"><sup>121</sup> Hence it is easy to confuse these two words.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3312"><sup>122</sup> Hence the <italic>shofar</italic> which is made from a ram&#x2019;s horn, is by extension referred to as a <italic>yovel.</italic> Thus <italic>bi-meshokh ha-yovel</italic> is to be rendered: when the ram&#x2019;s horn soundeth long. I.E. uses the term <italic>keves,</italic> which means a lamb. He probably meant a ram. See <italic>Rosh Ha-Shanah</italic> 26a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3313"><sup>123</sup> J.P.S. renders it as the horn.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3314"><sup>124</sup> In other words, <italic>yovel</italic> is so called because it is inaugurated by the sounding of the <italic>shofar,</italic> which is made from a ram&#x2019;s horn.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3316"><sup>126</sup> J.P.S. renders it as the horn. We thus see that <italic>shofar</italic> and <italic>yovel</italic> refer to one and the same thing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3317"><sup>127</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ha-yovel.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3327"><sup>137</sup> Mount Sinai. In other words, the sounding of the <italic>shofar</italic> will signal that one is permitted to climb Mount Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3328"><sup>138</sup> Mount Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3329"><sup>139</sup> According to Rabbi Samuel, <italic>when the ram&#x2019;s horn soundeth long</italic> means when the ram&#x2019;s horn soundeth long after the revelation. Rabbi Samuel thus disagrees with Saadiah&#x2019;s interpretation that the reference is to the Day of Atonement when Moses descended Sinai.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3335"><sup>145</sup> Verse 11 tells us that God told Moses, <italic>ve-hayu nekhonim la-yom ha-shelishi</italic> (and be ready against the third day). However, our verse reports that Moses told Israel, <italic>heyu nekhonim li-sheloshet yamim</italic> (be ready against the third day). According to the Rabbinic sage Rabbi Jose, Moses told Israel be ready for three days (which is the literal meaning of <italic>heyu nekhonim li-sheloshet yamim</italic>). That is, God will reveal himself to you on the fourth day. Moses thus added another day on his own. See <italic>Sabbath</italic> 87a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3336"><sup>146</sup> That there is no difference between <italic>li-sheloshet ha-yamim</italic> and <italic>la-yom ha-shelishi.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3337"><sup>147</sup> We thus see that Scripture interchanges <italic>sheloshet yamim</italic> and <italic>yom ha-shelishi.</italic> Hence they must have one meaning.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 20</title>
<p>1. AND GOD SPOKE. There are some very difficult questions to be raised in this chapter. Many say that God only uttered the first two statements.<sup><xref rid="fn3421">1</xref></sup> As proof they offer the fact that the first statement reads, <italic>I am the Lord thy God</italic> (v. 2), and the second, <italic>for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God</italic> (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn3422">2</xref></sup> However, the third statement reads, <italic>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</italic> (v. 7) and does not say &#x201C;My&#x201D; name; the fourth reads, <italic>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it</italic> (v. 11); the fifth reads, <italic>that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</italic> (v. 12). One may ask, how can <italic>I am the Lord</italic> be counted among the Ten Statements,<sup><xref rid="fn3423">3</xref></sup> as God is the one who commands?<sup><xref rid="fn3424">4</xref></sup> Clearly, <italic>I am the Lord</italic> is neither a positive nor a negative commandment.</p>
<p>The following questions are even more difficult than the above-noted ones. When we read this chapter, namely, the Torah portion <italic>Va-Yishma Yitro</italic> (And Jethro heard)<sup><xref rid="fn3425">5</xref></sup> first, and then read the Torah portion <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> (And I besought) (Deut. 3:23; 7:11), we notice that from <italic>I am the Lord</italic> (v. 2) through <italic>the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain</italic> (v. 7) there is no difference in the two portions.<sup><xref rid="fn3426">6</xref></sup> However, starting from <italic>Remember</italic> (v. 8) to the conclusion of the Ten Statements, there are differences in every place.</p>
<p><italic>Yitro</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3427">7</xref></sup> reads, <italic>Remember</italic> (v. 5), while <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3428">8</xref></sup> has, <italic>Observe</italic> (Deut. 5:12). The latter also ends with the addition, <italic>as the Lord thy God commanded thee. Yitro</italic> states, <italic>nor thy cattle</italic> (v. 10); <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> adds, <italic>nor thine ox, nor thine ass</italic> (Deut. 5:14).</p>
<p>More difficult than all of these is that the reason given for the Sabbath in <italic>Yitro</italic> is, <italic>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</italic> (v. 12). The verse then goes on to say, <italic>wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it</italic> (v. 12). Now these verses are not quoted in <italic>Va-Etchannan,</italic> which offers a totally different reason for the Sabbath. It states, <italic>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt</italic> (Deut. 5:15). The latter concludes with, <italic>therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.</italic></p>
<p>Scripture tells us in <italic>Yitro</italic> and in <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> that the reward for honoring one&#x2019;s father and mother is <italic>that thy days may be long.<sup><xref rid="fn3429">9</xref></sup></italic> However, <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> adds, <italic>and that it may go well with thee</italic> (Deut. 5:16). It also adds, <italic>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.) to the commandment dealing with honoring one&#x2019;s father and mother.</p>
<p><italic>Yitro</italic> reads, <italic>Thou shalt not murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness</italic> (v. 13). <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> reads: <italic>Thou shalt not murder. Neither shalt thou commit adultery. Neither shalt thou steal. Neither shalt thou bear false witness</italic> (Deut. 5:17). <italic>Yitro</italic> reads, <italic>ed sheker</italic> (false witness) (v. 13). <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> reads, <italic>ed shav</italic> (false witness) (Deut. 5:17). <italic>Yitro</italic> reads, <italic>Thou shalt not covet</italic> (lo tachmod) <italic>thy neighbor&#x2019;s house; thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife</italic> (v. 14).</p>
<p><italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> has, <italic>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife: neither shalt thou desire</italic> (ve-lo titaweh) <italic>thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> (Deut. 5:18). It also has, <italic>his field</italic>. &#x201C;His field&#x201D; is missing in <italic>Yitro.</italic> In <italic>Yitro, his man-servant, nor his maid-servant</italic> precede <italic>his ox, nor his ass</italic> (v. 14). However, in <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> (Deut. 5:18) <italic>his ox, or his ass</italic> precede <italic>his man-servant, or his maid-servant.</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn3430">10</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Yitro</italic> states: <italic>And God spoke all these words, saying</italic> (v. 1). However, <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> reads: <italic>These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly</italic> (Deut. 5:19).</p>
<p>When we searched the words of our sages to see what they said concerning this, we found that they said, &#x201C;<italic>Remember</italic> (v. 8) and <italic>Observe</italic> (Deut. 5:12) were uttered simultaneously.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3431">11</xref></sup> Now this statement is, as I will explain, more difficult than all the other questions which we raised. Heaven forbid that I say the sages spoke incorrectly, for our minds are insignificant in comparison to theirs. The problem is that our contemporaries take the words of our sages at face value. However, this is not so, as I will explain after I finish noting all of the questions this chapter raises. I will then explain the proper way to remove all problems and questions pertaining to this chapter.</p>
<p><italic>Observe</italic> and <italic>Remember</italic> could have been uttered simultaneously only miraculously. Now even if we admit that a miracle did occur there is still room to ask why Scripture did not write <italic>Remember</italic> and <italic>Observe</italic> in <italic>Yitro</italic> and also in <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic>? Furthermore, what shall we do with the other verses that come in two versions? If we assume that they were simultaneously uttered, like <italic>Observe</italic> and <italic>Remember,</italic> why didn&#x2019;t our sages of blessed memory mention it, as this is an even greater miracle? For even if we assume that two different words with one meaning can be uttered simultaneously, one can still ask, how is it possible for many verses with different meanings to be stated at the same time? Additionally, why would God say, <italic>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic> (Deut. 5:12)?<sup><xref rid="fn3432">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, when before the assembly around Mount Sinai did the Lord command one to honor his father and mother?<sup><xref rid="fn3433">13</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Yitro</italic> does not have, <italic>that it may be well with thee</italic> (Deut. 5:16).<sup><xref rid="fn3434">14</xref></sup> Hence God said this, or He did not say it.<sup><xref rid="fn3435">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, how could God say, <italic>Neither shalt thou commit adultery</italic> (Deut. 5:17)?<sup><xref rid="fn3436">16</xref></sup> Also, how could God say, <italic>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> (v. 14) and in <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> say, <italic>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife</italic> (Deut. 5:18)?<sup><xref rid="fn3437">17</xref></sup> Additionally, how could God say, <italic>his man-servant, or his maid-servant</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3438">18</xref></sup> and then <italic>his ox, or his ass,</italic> and at the same time say the opposite?<sup><xref rid="fn3439">19</xref></sup> It is impossible to rationally accept such things.</p>
<p>Even more difficult than all of the things that I have mentioned above is that all the wonders which Moses performed have some parallel [in the world of our experience].<sup><xref rid="fn3440">20</xref></sup> This will be understood by the intelligent. Now, God&#x2019;s saying <italic>Remember</italic> and <italic>Observe</italic> simultaneously is a wonder of wonders.<sup><xref rid="fn3441">21</xref></sup> Such a wonder should have been clearly recorded in the Torah more than all the signs and wonders that are noted therein. Even if we maintain that God&#x2019;s speech is unlike human speech,<sup><xref rid="fn3442">22</xref></sup> how did Israel understand what God was saying? For if a person hears, <italic>Remember,</italic> and <italic>Observe</italic> simultaneously, he understands neither the one nor the other. Even in the case of one word, namely, the word <italic>zakhor</italic> (remember),<sup><xref rid="fn3443">23</xref></sup> if one does not hear the <italic>zayin</italic> enunciated before the <italic>kaf</italic> and the <italic>resh</italic> he will not understand what the speaker is saying.</p>
<p>We clearly know that the eye perceives much better than the ear does, for we have indisputable proof that thunder sounds at the very moment that the lightning is seen. Now the eye perceives the lightning from a distance.<sup><xref rid="fn3444">24</xref></sup> However, the sound is brought to the ear by the air. The sound travels slowly and does not reach the ear until a moment has passed. Now the forms of the letters that one enunciates are &#x201C;written&#x201D; in the air after the manner of the five organs which produce them.<sup><xref rid="fn3445">25</xref></sup> They are not written in the manner of script, which is produced by the human hand.<sup><xref rid="fn3446">26</xref></sup> Now the entire letter <italic>zayin</italic> enters the ear before the <italic>kaf,</italic> the <italic>vav,</italic> and the <italic>resh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3447">27</xref></sup> Even if we assume that <italic>Remember</italic> and <italic>Observe</italic> were miraculously uttered simultaneously, how was Israel able to understand what was being said? If we assume that the ear, which does not normally have the ability to hear two words at the time, was at that time miraculously able to hear two words at the same time, why didn&#x2019;t the sages of blessed memory mention this? For this is a greater miracle than God&#x2019;s uttering two words simultaneously.<sup><xref rid="fn3448">28</xref></sup> Aside from this, what shall we do with the remaining questions relating to variant verses which, unlike <italic>Observe</italic> and <italic>Remember,</italic> do not have the same meaning? What are we to do with statements that appear in <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3449">29</xref></sup> and do not appear in <italic>Yitro</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn3450">30</xref></sup> Also, how are we to harmonize <italic>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> (v. 14) with <italic>Neither shalt thou covet they neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> (Deut. 5:18)?<sup><xref rid="fn3451">31</xref></sup> How are we to explain the reversals?<sup><xref rid="fn3452">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>I cannot explain the above to you<sup><xref rid="fn3453">33</xref></sup> until I first make clear to you the rules of the Hebrew tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn3454">34</xref></sup> Now God is my witness, He knows the deepest recesses of my mind. God knows that I would have remained silent if I did not have to explain the above difficulties.<sup><xref rid="fn3455">35</xref></sup> However, before I begin, I will explain the words of our sages of blessed memory.<sup><xref rid="fn3456">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abraham the author declares: It is the style of those who speak Hebrew to express their thoughts very clearly at times. However, at other times it is their style to say what they must in as few words as is necessary for a person to understand their meaning. Note that words are like bodies and their meanings are like souls. The body is, at it were, a vessel for the soul. Hence all the wise men of all nations<sup><xref rid="fn3457">37</xref></sup> are in the habit of preserving the ideas conveyed by a word<sup><xref rid="fn3458">38</xref></sup> and are not concerned with changes in wording when the meaning remains one and the same. I will now offer you a number of examples.<sup><xref rid="fn3459">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>God told Cain: <italic>And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother&#x2019;s blood from the ground&#x2026; When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth</italic> (Gen. 4:11,12). Cain replied: <italic>Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land</italic> (Gen. 4:14). Now who is so simple as to think<sup><xref rid="fn3460">40</xref></sup> that the latter verse does not convey what the former verse does because of the change in words.</p>
<p>Look, Eliezer said, <italic>Give me to drink</italic> (hagmi&#x2019;ini), <italic>I pray thee</italic> (Gen. 24:17). However, he quoted himself as saying, <italic>Let me drink</italic> (hashkini), <italic>I pray thee</italic> (Gen. 24:45). Moses said, <italic>the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon</italic> (Ex. 12:29). However, it is earlier written, <italic>the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill</italic> (Ex. 11:5). In Deuteronomy, Moses quoted the prayer which he offered on behalf of Israel because of the golden calf (Deut. 9:26-29). Now to the unintelligent, this prayer appears totally different from the one recorded in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic> (Ex. 32:11-14). The general rule is, one will find the same meaning in different words whenever anything is repeated in Scripture, such as the dreams of Pharaoh<sup><xref rid="fn3461">41</xref></sup> and Nebuchadnezzar,<sup><xref rid="fn3462">42</xref></sup> and many other things.</p>
<p>Now Scripture, as I noted, sometimes abridges and other times elaborates. It does the same with prefixes.<sup><xref rid="fn3463">43</xref></sup> At times it adds them. At other times it leaves them out. However, the meaning remains the same. Thus God said, <italic>and blue</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3464">44</xref></sup> <italic>and purple</italic> (Ex. 25:4). However, Moses said, <italic>blue</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3465">45</xref></sup> <italic>and purple</italic> (Ex. 28:6). God said, <italic>onyx stones</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3466">46</xref></sup> (Ex. 25:7). However, Moses said, <italic>and onyx stones</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3467">47</xref></sup> (Ex. 35:9). There are many such instances. Either way is correct, as the verse which leaves out the <italic>vav</italic> is employing a concise style. There is no harm in it.<sup><xref rid="fn3468">48</xref></sup> Similarly, the verse which has a <italic>vav</italic> in it does no harm because it adds clarity.</p>
<p>Now one does not search for a reason that a <italic>vav,</italic> which is enunciated by the mouth,<sup><xref rid="fn3469">49</xref></sup> is sometimes left out, sometimes written, and sometimes added.<sup><xref rid="fn3470">50</xref></sup> For any of the aforementioned<sup><xref rid="fn3471">51</xref></sup> is correct. We do not look for the reason why an enunciated <italic>vav</italic> was written.<sup><xref rid="fn3472">52</xref></sup> This being the case, why should we look for reasons regarding<sup><xref rid="fn3473">53</xref></sup> the silent <italic>vav</italic> which is not enunciated? For example, we should not ask why the word <italic>le-olam</italic> (forever)<sup><xref rid="fn3474">54</xref></sup> is written with or without a <italic>vav</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3475">55</xref></sup> Now people want reasons for full and also for deficient spellings. I would have kept silent if they wanted reasons for each one of them,<sup><xref rid="fn3476">56</xref></sup> or if there was only one way to spell these words.<sup><xref rid="fn3477">57</xref></sup> I will give you an example. Suppose someone tells me, &#x201C;Write the following to my friend: I so and so love you forever;&#x201D; and I spelled <italic>ploni</italic> (so and so) without a <italic>vav,</italic> and also <italic>ohevekha</italic> (I love you) without a <italic>vav</italic> and <italic>le-olam</italic> (forever) deficiently.<sup><xref rid="fn3478">58</xref></sup> Then Reuben came to me and asked me why I wrote deficiently. Now my concern is to write what I was told to write. I am not concerned with full or deficient spellings.<sup><xref rid="fn3479">59</xref></sup> Perhaps Levi will come along and teach me how to write.<sup><xref rid="fn3480">60</xref></sup> I do not want to dwell on this. However, the intelligent will understand what I mean.<sup><xref rid="fn3481">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will now explain the above-noted difficulties.<sup><xref rid="fn3482">62</xref></sup> Note that this chapter preserves the wording of the Ten Statements exactly as uttered by God, for Scripture states, <italic>And God spoke all these words, saying</italic> (v. 1). The statements open with <italic>I am the Lord thy God,</italic> and close with <italic>nor any thing that is thy neighbor&#x2019;s</italic> (v. 14). Moses also noted, <italic>These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire</italic> (Deut. 5:19) when he mentioned the Ten Statements a second time. The Ten Statements have no break in them.<sup><xref rid="fn3483">63</xref></sup> Furthermore, the Lord uttered all of them exactly as they were written by the finger of God. One can refute the evidence<sup><xref rid="fn3484">64</xref></sup> from the third, fourth, and fifth statements, which are not in the first person,<sup><xref rid="fn3485">65</xref></sup> as follows: now that you have accepted the Lord as your God,<sup><xref rid="fn3486">66</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</italic> (v. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn3487">67</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</italic> (v. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn3488">68</xref></sup> It should also be noted that it is the style of those who speak Hebrew to speak in this manner.<sup><xref rid="fn3489">69</xref></sup> Thus Scripture states, <italic>neither shall the fat of My feast remain all night until the morning</italic> (Ex. 23:18). This is then followed by <italic>into the house of the Lord thy God</italic> (Ex. 23:19). There are many such examples.</p>
<p>Those who say that the first statement<sup><xref rid="fn3490">70</xref></sup> is not part of the Ten Statements differ in the following. Some say that <italic>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me</italic> (v. 3) is the first statement, and <italic>Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image</italic> (v. 4) the second. However, this is incorrect, as both statements deal with one and the same thing.<sup><xref rid="fn3491">71</xref></sup> One (v. 3) deals with accepting another god in secret and the other (v. 4) openly.<sup><xref rid="fn3492">72</xref></sup> One (v. 3) deals with belief and the other (v. 4) with action. Now in the statement <italic>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy&#x2026;thou, thy son&#x2026;thy daughter,</italic> openly or secretly is all in the one commandment (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn3493">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that <italic>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> (v. 14) is the ninth statement, and <italic>thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.) is the tenth.<sup><xref rid="fn3494">74</xref></sup> They offer as proof the fact that God said, <italic>Thou shalt not covet</italic> twice, for there are two types of coveting. One is active, like an act of thievery, as in <italic>neither shall any man covet thy land</italic> (Ex. 34:24).<sup><xref rid="fn3495">75</xref></sup> Now if the latter dealt with coveting in one&#x2019;s heart, then the Land of Israel would be a bad place.<sup><xref rid="fn3496">76</xref></sup> The second type of coveting is with one&#x2019;s heart. Hence Moses had to explain<sup><xref rid="fn3497">77</xref></sup> that its meaning is,<sup><xref rid="fn3498">78</xref></sup> thou shalt not desire.<sup><xref rid="fn3499">79</xref></sup> However, this too<sup><xref rid="fn3500">80</xref></sup> is nonsense. Why would God mention thievery only with regard to a house and not mention other things along with it?<sup><xref rid="fn3501">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will offer you proof from the very words of Moses that these commentators explained incorrectly. Look, God said, <italic>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> (v. 14). However, Moses said, <italic>Neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife</italic> (Deut. 5:18). In their opinion, the second <italic>Thou shalt not covet</italic> written in our chapter refers to coveting with one&#x2019;s heart, and the first one deals with the theft of a house. If this is the case, then Moses<sup><xref rid="fn3502">82</xref></sup> inverted the matter, for he used, <italic>Neither shalt thou desire</italic> with <italic>thy neighbor&#x2019;s house,</italic> and <italic>Thou shalt not covet,</italic> which means thou shalt not steal, with <italic>thy neighbor&#x2019;s wife.</italic> Their definitions are thus destroyed. The truth of the matter is that <italic>I am the Lord thy God</italic> is, as I will explain in its place, the first statement.</p>
<p>I will now comment on <italic>Remember</italic> and <italic>Observe.</italic> Note that the meaning, not the wording, is preserved.<sup><xref rid="fn3503">83</xref></sup> Thus our father Isaac said to Esau, <italic>that my soul may bless thee before I die</italic> (Gen. 27:4). However, Rebekah told Jacob that she heard Isaac say, <italic>and bless thee before the Lord before my death</italic> (Gen. 27:7). Now <italic>lifne moti</italic> (before I die) <italic>(Ibid</italic>.) means the same as <italic>betrem amut</italic> (before I die).<sup><xref rid="fn3504">84</xref></sup> This being the case,<sup><xref rid="fn3505">85</xref></sup> why did Rebekah add, <italic>before the Lord</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn3506">86</xref></sup> The answer is that Rebekah knew that Isaac was a prophet of the Lord and that the blessing which he would pronounce would be prophetically uttered. Hence she said, <italic>before the Lord</italic> to Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn3507">87</xref></sup> She was, as it were, explaining the meaning of the blessing.<sup><xref rid="fn3508">88</xref></sup> Moses acted in a similar fashion. The Ten Statements recorded in this chapter are God&#x2019;s very words without any additions or subtractions, and they alone were inscribed on the tablets of the covenant. It is not as Saadiah says that <italic>Remember</italic> was on one side and <italic>Observe</italic> was on the second side.<sup><xref rid="fn3509">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Ten Statements recorded in the Torah portion <italic>Va-Etchannan</italic> are the words of Moses. The fact that the second version twice reads, <italic>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3510">90</xref></sup> is positive proof that this is so.<sup><xref rid="fn3511">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that memory is stored in the back of brain, which is in the head. The forms are there preserved. Now memory includes observance.<sup><xref rid="fn3512">92</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>Remember</italic> is that one should keep in mind every day of the week what day that happens to be.<sup><xref rid="fn3513">93</xref></sup> The reason for all of this is that one will observe the seventh day and do no work on it. The reason for remembering is for observance.<sup><xref rid="fn3514">94</xref></sup> Thus when God said, <italic>Remember,</italic> all the people understood that its meaning was, <italic>Observe.</italic> Hence <italic>Remember</italic> and <italic>Observe</italic> were, as it were, said simultaneously.</p>
<p>Moses [similarly] had no need to mention <italic>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</italic> (v. 11) in the second version<sup><xref rid="fn3515">95</xref></sup> because he had at first stated, <italic>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic> (Deut. 5:13). The latter clause is to be understood as if it read, <italic>as the Lord thy God commended thee</italic> in &#x201C;your Torah,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3516">96</xref></sup> in the commandment opening with <italic>Remember</italic> (v. 8) and closing with <italic>and hallowed it</italic> (v. 11).</p>
<p>Now God commanded that man- and maid-servants rest on the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn3517">97</xref></sup> The Lord, however, did not give a reason for this.<sup><xref rid="fn3518">98</xref></sup> Moses therefore explained the reason. Moses said the reason God commanded that servants should rest on the Sabbath is that a person should remember that, like the servant, he too was a slave in Egypt, and God redeemed him from there.</p>
<p>Note that eight of the statements are entirely negative commandments and that <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3519">99</xref></sup> is a positive commandment.</p>
<p>The rational wisdom which God has implanted in man&#x2019;s heart teaches us that we are obligated to repay with good the good that a person has done for us. Now a child comes into the world only because of his parents. They nurse him, they care for him, they raise him, they give him to drink, they feed him, and they dress him. One has to honor one&#x2019;s parents because they are the cause of his living upon the face of the earth. Hence the reward for honoring one&#x2019;s parents is <italic>that thy days may be long upon the land</italic> (v. 12). God commanded a person to honor his parents because God breathed a soul into him<sup><xref rid="fn3520">100</xref></sup> through his parents who prepared the body, for he who honors them honors God. Now Moses said, <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother</italic> (Deut. 5:16) and then added by way of explanation, <italic>as the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn3521">101</xref></sup> As I will explain in my comments on the verse that opens with the words <italic>Thou shalt not eat it</italic> (Deut. 12:25), reward is given for the observance of the positive commandments and punishment is meted out for the violation of negative commandments. Moses thus said that one is obligated to honor one&#x2019;s parents <italic>that thy days may be long</italic> (Deut. 5:16). The obligation to honor one&#x2019;s parents is dictated by reason. In addition, one who honor&#x2019;s his parents will receive a good reward, namely, <italic>thy days will be long</italic> because one listened to the voice of God who commanded us to honor them. Thus what was noted in the explanation of Rebekah&#x2019;s words<sup><xref rid="fn3522">102</xref></sup> also applies to what Moses said.</p>
<p>I have already noted that the terms <italic>onyx stones</italic> and <italic>and onyx stones</italic> mean the same thing. <italic>Thou shalt not commit adultery</italic> (v. 13) and <italic>Neither shalt thou commit adultery</italic> (Deut. 5:17), and <italic>ed sheker</italic> (false witness) (v. 13) and <italic>ed shav</italic> (false witness) (Deut. 5:17), are similarly &#x201C;children of one father.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3523">103</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not covet</italic> (v. 14) and <italic>neither shalt thou desire</italic> (Deut. 5:18) likewise come out of one womb.<sup><xref rid="fn3524">104</xref></sup> God said, <italic>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> (v. 14) because intelligent people first acquire a house and then a wife, next a man-servant and a maid-servant, and then an ox and an ass to plow their fields. Our chapter lists these items in this order. However, Moses<sup><xref rid="fn3525">105</xref></sup> listed them in another order, for young men first desire a woman, then a house. Now since Moses spoke of the house and the field, he next took note of the ox and the ass<sup><xref rid="fn3526">106</xref></sup> because they are used in plowing one&#x2019;s field. Moses next mentioned the man-servant and the maid-servant. At the very end Moses, like God, generalized and said, <italic>or any thing that is thy neighbor&#x2019;s</italic> (Deut. 5:18).</p>
<p>Scripture reads, <italic>These words the Lord spoke</italic> (Deut. 5:19), and not <italic>all these words</italic> (v. 1) as is first written, because God&#x2019;s words are intermingled with Moses&#x2019; words.</p>
<p>THE FIRST STATEMENT: I AM THE LORD.</p>
<p>Note that all of the commandments fall into one of the following two categories. One category consists of rational laws which God implanted into the minds of all intelligent human beings. There are many such commandments. The only one of the Ten Statements which does not fall into this category is the command to observe the Sabbath. Hence every intelligent human being of every nation and of every tongue assents to them, for they are implanted in the human mind by reason. There is nothing to add to them or to subtract from them. Abraham observed them along with additional precepts.<sup><xref rid="fn3527">107</xref></sup> God gave the Torah only to rational human beings. He who is without reason has no Torah.</p>
<p>The second category that the precepts fall into is that of &#x201C;hidden commandments,&#x201D; that is, commandments for which that the Torah does not reveal any reason. Far be it, far be it for one to even think that any of these commandments contradict reason. We must in all instances observe everything that God has commanded us, whether their secret has or has not been revealed to us. If we find that one of the commandments contradicts reason, then we should not take it at face value but must search for its meaning in the books of our wise men, of blessed memory, to find out whether it is a parable. If we do not find this recorded,<sup><xref rid="fn3528">108</xref></sup> then we must investigate and try to understand it with all of our strength. Perhaps we can explain it. If we cannot, then we must leave it as it is and admit that we do not know its meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn3529">109</xref></sup> <italic>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart</italic> (Deut. 10:16) is an example of the aforementioned. Now did God command us to sadistically murder people?<sup><xref rid="fn3530">110</xref></sup> We know of a certainty that each one of the commandments that are not placed upon us by reason has a secret meaning to it, though it be hidden from us. The fact that in some instances Scripture gives the reason why they were commanded is proof of this. Thus Scripture tells us that the Sabbath is in memory of God&#x2019;s creation of the world; and the festival of unleavened bread, <italic>that thou mayest remember the day when thou earnest forth out of the land of Egypt</italic> (Deut. 16:3). Scripture states, <italic>Love ye therefore the stranger; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt</italic> (Deut. 10:19).<sup><xref rid="fn3531">111</xref></sup> Sowing with two kinds of seeds is prohibited, <italic>lest the fullness of the seed&#x2026;be forfeited</italic> (Deut. 22:9). Scripture states, <italic>Only he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3532">112</xref></sup> <italic>shall not multiply horses so that he does not cause the people to return to Egypt</italic> (Deut. 17:16).<sup><xref rid="fn3533">113</xref></sup> It similarly gives the reason why <italic>Neither shall he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3534">114</xref></sup> <italic>multiply wives to himself</italic> (Deut. 17:17), namely, <italic>that his heart turn not away</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). The latter is not an independent commandment as Rabbi Simeon ben Kayyara<sup><xref rid="fn3535">115</xref></sup> states.<sup><xref rid="fn3536">116</xref></sup> Scripture similarly tells us the reason for <italic>and he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3537">117</xref></sup> <italic>shall read therein</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3538">118</xref></sup> (Deut. 17:19), namely, <italic>that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren</italic> (Deut. 17:20). We similarly find in the chapter dealing with the assembly,<sup><xref rid="fn3539">119</xref></sup> <italic>and that they may learn</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3540">120</xref></sup> (Deut. 31:12). This is the case with many commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn3541">121</xref></sup> Hence<sup><xref rid="fn3542">122</xref></sup> every intelligent human being whose eyes have been opened by God can learn from the Torah the secret of all the commandments.</p>
<p>There are three types of commandments, namely, commandments observed with one&#x2019;s heart, commandments observed by speech, and commandments observed by acts. The commandments observed with the heart are of two sorts, namely, positive and negative commandments. The positive commandments include: <italic>Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God</italic> (Deut. 11:1); <italic>and to cleave unto him</italic> (Deut. 11:22); <italic>that thou mayest fear this glorious and awful Name</italic> (Deut. 28:58); <italic>but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself</italic> (Lev. 19:18). The negative commandments include: <italic>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart</italic> (Lev. 19:17.); <italic>Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge</italic> (Lev. 19:18).</p>
<p>The commandments observed by speech also consist of positive and negative commandments. Among the positive commandments are: reading the <italic>shema,</italic> saying grace after meals, uttering the priestly benedictions, and making a confession [declaration] when one brings tithes.<sup><xref rid="fn3543">123</xref></sup> There are many such commandments. Among the negative precepts<sup><xref rid="fn3544">124</xref></sup> we find: <italic>Thou shalt not bear false witness</italic> (v. 13); <italic>Thou shalt not revile God</italic> (Ex. 22:27), and <italic>Thou shalt not curse the deaf</italic> (Lev. 19:14).</p>
<p>The positive commandments and negative commandments observed through actions are legion. There is no reason to mention them.</p>
<p>The commandments incumbent on the heart are the most important and the most prominent of the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn3545">125</xref></sup> Many people think that with the exception of idol worship there are no sins connected to thought.<sup><xref rid="fn3546">126</xref></sup> The truth of the matter is that idol worship is worse than all the other mental sins put together. Can they<sup><xref rid="fn3547">127</xref></sup> not see that Scripture writes, <italic>There are six things which the Lord hateth</italic> (Prov. 6:16), and then goes on to say, <italic>A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts</italic> (Prov. 6:18). Scripture furthermore states: <italic>thou didst well that was in thy heart</italic> (II Chron. 6:8); <italic>Do good, O Lord, unto the good, And to them that are upright in their hearts</italic> (Ps. 125:4); <italic>Let your heart therefore be whole with the Lord our God</italic> (I Kings 8:61): <italic>I the Lord search the heart</italic> (Jer. 17:10); <italic>but the Lord looketh on the heart</italic> (I Sam. 16:7).</p>
<p>Now the first statement<sup><xref rid="fn3548">128</xref></sup> is the basis of the nine that follow it. Its place is among the precepts of the heart.<sup><xref rid="fn3549">129</xref></sup> The first statement teaches that one should believe with an unwavering faith that this glorious God, whose name is written but not pronounced,<sup><xref rid="fn3550">130</xref></sup> is one&#x2019;s only God.</p>
<p>Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, who rests in glory, once asked me why God said, <italic>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt</italic> rather than, I am the Lord thy God who made heaven and earth and created you? I answered the following. Know that people who believe in God the glorious are not on the same level of faith. Many believe what they have heard; that is, they believe because their masters have told them so. Above them are those who believe because of what they have read in the Torah, which God gave to Moses. Now they would place their hands upon their mouths<sup><xref rid="fn3551">131</xref></sup> if a heretic were to come along and argue that God does not exist, for they do not possess the means to answer. Now a person whose heart has moved him<sup><xref rid="fn3552">132</xref></sup> to study the sciences, which are the steps that lead to the place of his desire,<sup><xref rid="fn3553">133</xref></sup> will see God&#x2019;s work in the metals, in the plants and living creatures, and in the human body itself. He will know the makeup of each organ according to the scientific explanations of how each organ functions. He will similarly know the reason for each organ&#x2019;s form. His heart will then aspire to learn the science of the spheres that are the Lord&#x2019;s works in the middle world,<sup><xref rid="fn3554">134</xref></sup> which is everlasting. He will learn when the sun or moon is eclipsed. He will know how the moon causes the sun to be eclipsed. He will know why the moon is eclipsed and what causes its eclipses. He will know these things and be able to prove them beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>
<p>The intelligent person will come to know God by learning the ways of God.<sup><xref rid="fn3555">135</xref></sup> Moses similarly stated, <italic>show me now Thy ways, that I may know Thee</italic> (Ex. 33:13). Now God the revered proclaimed, I <italic>am the Lord thy God</italic> in His first statement.<sup><xref rid="fn3556">136</xref></sup> Only one who is of great intellect can understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn3557">137</xref></sup> I have already explained in the Torah portion, <italic>Ve-Eleh Shemot</italic> that God alone is everlasting without any change and that there is none aside from Him that exists forever, and none aside from Him is <italic>enthroned of old, Selah,</italic> (Ps. 55:20).</p>
<p>God alone maintains the uppermost world<sup><xref rid="fn3558">138</xref></sup> by His power. The middle world is maintained by God&#x2019;s power and by His holy angels, who are of the uppermost world. Ours, the lowest of the worlds, is maintained by God&#x2019;s power plus the power of the two higher worlds. Now the statement <italic>I am the Lord</italic> is sufficient for the intelligent of any nation.<sup><xref rid="fn3559">139</xref></sup> But only Israel<sup><xref rid="fn3560">140</xref></sup> believes that the sky and earth were made close to five thousand years ago. The nations of the world do not deny that God alone made sky and earth. They differ only in that they maintain that God continuously creates without beginning or end.<sup><xref rid="fn3561">141</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the Lord performed signs and wonders in Egypt until Moses brought them out of there so that He would be their God. Moses similarly said, <italic>Or hath God assayed to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation</italic> (Deut. 4:34). The meaning of the latter is that God did for Israel what He did not do for any other nation. God created the middle world.<sup><xref rid="fn3562">142</xref></sup> He rules over the lowest of the worlds.<sup><xref rid="fn3563">143</xref></sup> Good or bad befalls every nation according to the arrangement of its star, for this is what God has apportioned to them. Now Israel was destined to continue in slavery according to the stars of its constellation. However, because of God&#x2019;s love of the patriarchs, the Lord used His power to bring forth signs in the lowest world which were not decreed by the powers of the middle world. God removed Israel from the rule of the constellations and made them the people of His very own inheritance. It is because of this that the ancients say, &#x201C;Israel has no star.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3564">144</xref></sup> I will yet explain this via parables in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa.</italic></p>
<p>It was because of the signs that God performed in Egypt that Moses said, <italic>Unto thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the Lord, He is God; there is none else beside Him</italic> (Deut. 4:35). Everyone, learn&#x00E8;d and nonlearn&#x00E8;d, adults and children, witnessed this. When recounting the events at the assembly at Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn3565">145</xref></sup> Moses added that Israel heard God&#x2019;s voice. Thus, following the latter, Moses said, <italic>Out of heaven He made thee to hear His voice, that He might instruct thee</italic> (Deut. 4:36). At the very end<sup><xref rid="fn3566">146</xref></sup> Moses said that ultimate knowledge consists in the development of one&#x2019;s mind to the point where one is able to prove to himself that the Lord alone is God.<sup><xref rid="fn3567">147</xref></sup> Scripture therefore states, <italic>know this day, and lay it to thy heart, that the Lord, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is none else</italic> (Deut. 4:39). David similarly said, <italic>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve Him</italic> (I Chron. 28:9). Knowledge is in the heart.<sup><xref rid="fn3568">148</xref></sup> It does not refer to confession with one&#x2019;s lips.<sup><xref rid="fn3569">149</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now it is for the intelligent that God said, <italic>I am the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3570">150</xref></sup> He added, <italic>who brought thee out of the land of Egypt</italic> (v. 2) so that the intelligent and the non-intelligent<sup><xref rid="fn3571">151</xref></sup> would understand. God added, <italic>thy God,</italic> meaning, you are obligated to serve me, that is, to be My servant and to be My people, and I will be your God, because <italic>I&#x2026;brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). The aforementioned was explained by Moses in the chapter that opens with the words <italic>When thy son asketh</italic> (Deut. 6:20.<sup><xref rid="fn3572">152</xref></sup> The meaning of the question<sup><xref rid="fn3573">153</xref></sup> is: why are we, more than any other nation, obligated to observe God&#x2019;s commandments? Have we not all one creator?<sup><xref rid="fn3574">154</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses gave three answers.<sup><xref rid="fn3575">155</xref></sup> The first one is, <italic>We were Pharaoh&#x2019;s bondmen in Egypt</italic> (Deut. 6:21) and God did all these good things<sup><xref rid="fn3576">156</xref></sup> for us. We are therefore obligated, even if we do not know the reason for His commandments, to observe everything that God commands us to do. The second one is, God did not decree the commandments to us because of His own needs but rather <italic>for our good always</italic> (Deut. 6:24). The third is, <italic>And it shall be righteousness unto us;</italic> that is, we will be righteous people and thus merit the world to come <italic>if we observe to do all this commandment before the Lord our God, as He hath commanded us</italic> (Deut. 6:25).</p>
<p>The philosophers have discovered that there are ten aspects relating to that which is corporeal.<sup><xref rid="fn3577">157</xref></sup> They are primary categories. There is nothing above them. The first pertains to a thing&#x2019;s essence. It is everlasting. The other nine are accidents. They depend on the first, are joined to it, and result from it. The first is like the number one in the number ten, for the entire sum<sup><xref rid="fn3578">158</xref></sup> came out of number one and all sums are found in it.<sup><xref rid="fn3579">159</xref></sup> One is the foundation.<sup><xref rid="fn3580">160</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the first statement uttered by God the glorious includes all precepts directed at the heart, tongue, and human deeds. For one who does not believe in his heart that God exists has no commandments upon him. A person is obligated to mention God&#x2019;s name every moment, to honor Him. Everything a person does,<sup><xref rid="fn3581">161</xref></sup> he must do only for the glory of God. A person should<sup><xref rid="fn3582">162</xref></sup> not keep from violating a negative precept except out of regard for God&#x2019;s glory. For example, a man who gives charity to the poor should not give it out of respect for the collector, nor so that people should praise him. For if this is the case, then a human being&#x2019;s status is more important in his eyes than the glory of God, who gave him wealth and abundance of money from which he can give charity and receive a reward from God.</p>
<p>The same applies to one who trespasses in secret so that<sup><xref rid="fn3583">163</xref></sup> his sin will not become known to the king, or people see him and come to consider him a shameful person. One who thinks thus<sup><xref rid="fn3584">164</xref></sup> is insane, for it is written, <italic>He that planted the ear, shall He not hear</italic> (Ps. 94:9). Now God sees the hidden things. He sees what people cannot openly see. God knows each one&#x2019;s thoughts and his secrets. Now a person is afraid of the king<sup><xref rid="fn3585">165</xref></sup> who will die on the next day and not punish him, and does not fear the True King in whose hands is his soul in this world and in the next world.</p>
<p>The Gaon, Rabbi Saadiah composed <italic>azharot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3586">166</xref></sup> He encompassed all the commandments<sup><xref rid="fn3587">167</xref></sup> in these Ten Statements.<sup><xref rid="fn3588">168</xref></sup></p>
<p>We find<sup><xref rid="fn3589">169</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s name<sup><xref rid="fn3590">170</xref></sup> in the first five statements.<sup><xref rid="fn3591">171</xref></sup> I have already explained that the first statement is the foundation upon which all the commandments rest. It is followed by <italic>Thou shalt have no other gods.</italic> The sin of the one who does not believe in God is greater than the sin of the one who worships idols. For there are many who believe in the Lord and offer sacrifices to idols, like those who offered to the queen of heaven, because they think that it can help them. As the verse says, <italic>But since we let off to offer to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, we have wanted all things</italic> (Jer. 44:18). Scripture also reads, <italic>They feared the Lord, and served their own gods</italic> (II Kings 17:33). We find the same with Naaman who said, <italic>when I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3592">172</xref></sup> <italic>the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing</italic> (II Kings 5:18). Now all of the above-mentioned believe in the Lord. However, they join another with Him. It is for this reason that the name of the revered God is written in this statement.<sup><xref rid="fn3593">173</xref></sup></p>
<p>God&#x2019;s name is also written in the third statement, for swearing falsely is less of a sin than idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn3594">174</xref></sup> Nevertheless, one who does this publicly shames the Lord. It is possible that the violator acts in this manner out of anger or need, for he believes in his heart in God and does not worship any deity along with the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn3595">175</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fourth statement tells us that the Lord<sup><xref rid="fn3596">176</xref></sup> rested on the seventh day. Thus he who does work on the Sabbath denies that God created the world. Now this sin is less severe than taking the name of the Lord in vain.</p>
<p>The Lord&#x2019;s name is written in the fifth statement because parents are God&#x2019;s partners in the creation of a human being. If a person does not honor his parents, it is as if he is not honoring God.</p>
<p>The five remaining statements deal with sins against a fellow human being.<sup><xref rid="fn3597">177</xref></sup> The first one is the most heinous, namely, causing the soul to separate from the body. This is followed by the rape of the body.<sup><xref rid="fn3598">178</xref></sup> Next comes, Thou shalt not steal money. Afterwards comes stealing with the tongue. Next comes coveting with one&#x2019;s heart.</p>
<p>3. THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS. Scripture speaks from the point of view of the idol worshipper.<sup><xref rid="fn3599">179</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>Then Hananiah the prophet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3600">180</xref></sup> <italic>took</italic> (Jer. 28:10); and, <italic>And the men pursued after them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3601">181</xref></sup> (Josh. 2:7). Samuel&#x2019;s statement, <italic>Why hast thou disquieted me</italic> (I Sam. 28:15) is similar, for Scripture speaks from Saul&#x2019;s point of view.<sup><xref rid="fn3602">182</xref></sup> This is not the place to explain it.<sup><xref rid="fn3603">183</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BEFORE ME.]<sup><xref rid="fn3604">184</xref></sup> Its meaning is like that of <italic>And Haran died before the face of his father</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3605">185</xref></sup> <italic>Terah</italic> (Gen. 11:28), which means that Terah was with Haran and saw him die. Similarly, <italic>and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest&#x2019;s office before the face of Aaron their father</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn3606">186</xref></sup> (Num. 3:4). The meaning of our verse thus is, it is unseemly for you to worship any other god along with Me since I am your God and am always with you and see what you do. One of the wise men once said, &#x201C;Do not anger your master when he sees you.&#x201D; Now this commandment, namely, <italic>Thou shalt have no other gods</italic> is directed to the heart and to the mouth, for aside from this precept there is no other negative commandment in the Torah directed to the heart.<sup><xref rid="fn3607">187</xref></sup> If a man says in the presence of witnesses that he intends to murder or commit adultery, he will not be executed for what he said as long as he does not commit any act. However, Scripture states concerning anyone who says, <italic>Let us go and serve other gods</italic> (Deut. 13:7), <italic>but thou shalt surely kill him</italic> (Deut. 13:10). On the other hand, the statement <italic>Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image</italic> (v. 4) deals with an act. It prohibits the making of a graven image out of wood or stone. It prohibits making any manner of likeness of anything that is in the heavens by any sort of means.</p>
<p>Scripture uses the term <italic>above</italic> because the heavens are above the earth on all sides. There are no likenesses in the heavens except for the forty-eight forms.<sup><xref rid="fn3608">188</xref></sup> Those who are wise about the forms do things that are wrong.<sup><xref rid="fn3609">189</xref></sup> What they do is very close to idolatry.</p>
<p>4. OR THAT IS THE EARTH BENEATH. There are many likenesses in the earth which is beneath the heavens<sup><xref rid="fn3610">190</xref></sup> and also in the water, as is explained in the Torah portion <italic>Ve-Etchannan.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3611">191</xref></sup> Scripture reads, <italic>the water under the earth</italic> because the sea and the earth are part of one globe.</p>
<p>5. THOU SHALT NOT BOW DOWN UNTO THEM. As do the masters of the forms,<sup><xref rid="fn3612">192</xref></sup> who think that they can cause upper powers to descend for the needs of a given person.</p>
<p>NOR SERVE THEM. <italic>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me</italic> includes sacrificing and offering to the gods. It also includes the prohibition <italic>and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth</italic> (Ex. 23:13) and the book of Joshua&#x2019;s statement <italic>nor cause</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3613">193</xref></sup> <italic>to swear by them</italic> (Josh. 23:7).</p>
<p>[A JEALOUS GOD.] What God demands is only logical,<sup><xref rid="fn3614">194</xref></sup> for how can you give the honor due to the Lord who created you and sustains your life to another who can neither harm nor aid.<sup><xref rid="fn3615">195</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture employs the term <italic>el</italic> (god) to inform us that the Lord is mighty and can exact vengeance at any moment from the idol worshipper without the sinner being able to save himself. Jeremiah said, <italic>every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge</italic> (Jer. 31:30). The book of Ezekiel clearly states that God the revered swore that <italic>the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father</italic> (Ezek. 18:20). This being the case, what does Scripture mean by <italic>visiting the iniquities of the father upon the children</italic>? The answer is that which Ezekiel clearly states. If a father was wicked and his son did not follow in his footsteps, then the son does not bear the iniquity of the father.<sup><xref rid="fn3616">196</xref></sup> For <italic>visiting the iniquities</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3617">197</xref></sup> is, as I have noted, connected to God&#x2019;s enemies.<sup><xref rid="fn3618">198</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Poked</italic> (visiting) has the same meaning as <italic>zokher</italic> (remembering).<sup><xref rid="fn3619">199</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And the Lord visited</italic> (pakad) <italic>Sarah</italic> (Gen. 21:1).<sup><xref rid="fn3620">200</xref></sup> which is another way of saying, and the Lord remembered (<italic>va-yizkor</italic>) Sarah. God is patient with the wicked because it is possible that he will repent and bear a son who is better than he. Now if the son walks in the footsteps of his father and so do the third and fourth generations, then God will not be patient and withhold his anger from the fourth generation. If all of them until four generations are enemies of God, then they will all perish in the fourth generation. For God will remember what the father did, what the son did, and what the grandson did. Hence he will not keep his anger in check when it comes to the fourth generation.</p>
<p>Grandchildren are considered as children.<sup><xref rid="fn3621">201</xref></sup> Hence Scripture employed a shortened form. One can understand this<sup><xref rid="fn3622">202</xref></sup> from the terms <italic>the third and fourth generation</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3623">203</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND SHOWING MERCY UNTO THE THOUSANDTH GENERATION.<sup><xref rid="fn3624">204</xref></sup> Scripture elsewhere reads, <italic>to a thousand generations</italic> (Deut. 7:9). Some people think this represents a problem.<sup><xref rid="fn3625">205</xref></sup> However, it does not, for Scripture reads as follows: if you will observe My commandments then God will keep the covenant and the mercy which He swore unto your ancestors, that is, to the three patriarchs.<sup><xref rid="fn3626">206</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations</italic> (Deut. 7:9). However this chapter deals with another matter. Scripture here states, <italic>and showing mercy to thousands</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3627">207</xref></sup> Its meaning is, without end, namely, forever. This can be explained in two ways. One, God shows mercy to those who love Him by granting everlasting existence to their souls so that they remain alive for thousands upon thousands of years. Two, that God will eternally show mercy to their offspring who are like them. David similarly said, <italic>But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear Him, And His righteousness unto children&#x2019;s children</italic> (Ps. 103:17).</p>
<p>Now there is no doubt that God&#x2019;s mercy is eternally upon those who fear Him.<sup><xref rid="fn3628">208</xref></sup> It is only because Scripture mentions the children&#x2019;s children,<sup><xref rid="fn3629">209</xref></sup> in keeping with <italic>And His righteousness endureth for ever</italic> (Ps. 111:3), that Scripture has to explain that this only applies if the children are good. Scripture therefore says that this is so only in regard to those who keep God&#x2019;s covenant. When I comment upon the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa,</italic> I will explain to you why the attribute of visiting the sins of the fathers is to be counted among the attributes of mercy.<sup><xref rid="fn3630">210</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THEM THAT LOVE ME.] The reference is to the pious.<sup><xref rid="fn3631">211</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND KEEP MY COMMANDS.] The reference is to the righteous.<sup><xref rid="fn3632">212</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN. The word <italic>shem</italic> (name) has the same meaning as the word <italic>zekher</italic> (memory). It serves as a sign of the one who is so called.<sup><xref rid="fn3633">213</xref></sup> However, the term <italic>zekher</italic> is employed in Hebrew at times when someone is recalled in memory, and at times when someone is recalled in speech, whereas names are only used with reference to the latter. We thus find David saying, <italic>Nor take their names upon my lips</italic> (Ps. 16:4). Now when a person mentions God&#x2019;s name<sup><xref rid="fn3634">214</xref></sup> he is saying, as God is True so is what I will say true. Thus if he does not keep his word, he is, as it were, denying God. It is still the custom in Egypt for one to incur the death penalty if he swears by the head of the king and does not keep his word. The culprit is not spared even if he gives his ransom in gold because he publicly insulted the king. If this is the case with regard to a king of flesh and blood, how many thousands of times more does one have to be careful that one&#x2019;s mouth does not cause his tongue to stumble and bring his flesh into guilt by mentioning God&#x2019;s name in vain.<sup><xref rid="fn3635">215</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Scripture tells us that Israel publicly took an oath because of the incident involving the concubine at Gibeah. We find that those who violated the oath were put to death.<sup><xref rid="fn3636">216</xref></sup> It should be noted that Phineas the priest was there.<sup><xref rid="fn3637">217</xref></sup> Similarly with the people of Jabesh-gilead, men, women, and children.<sup><xref rid="fn3638">218</xref></sup> Even those who desecrate the Sabbath are not dealt with in this manner.<sup><xref rid="fn3639">219</xref></sup> We also read that Saul wanted to kill his son Jonathan for desecrating an oath that Jonathan was not even aware of.<sup><xref rid="fn3640">220</xref></sup> Scripture also tells us<sup><xref rid="fn3641">221</xref></sup> that God brought a famine upon the land because Saul and his house violated the oath taken by the leaders of Israel which they swore unto the Gibeonites.<sup><xref rid="fn3642">222</xref></sup> We are told that when the house of blood was put to death, God was entreated for the land.<sup><xref rid="fn3643">223</xref></sup> Solomon similarly said to Shimei, <italic>Did I not make thee to swear by the Lord</italic> (I Kings 2:42).<sup><xref rid="fn3644">224</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sum of the matter is that with the exception of honoring one&#x2019;s parents,<sup><xref rid="fn3645">225</xref></sup> we do not find the reward for observing a commandment clearly spelled out in any of the Ten Statements. We similarly do not find the punishment for violating a commandment<sup><xref rid="fn3646">226</xref></sup> spelled out except for idolatry and taking God&#x2019;s name in vain. Many think that a person who takes the name of the Lord in vain does not commit a great sin. I will show that in reality it is more severe than any of the other prohibitions which follow. For a murderer cannot commit murder, nor an adulterer adultery, both of which are major sins, whenever they want to because they are afraid of being caught. However, the person who is the habit of swearing falsely will daily utter innumerable vows. Such a person is so accustomed to committing this sin that he is not even aware that he is taking an oath. Should someone chide him and say to him, &#x201C;Why are you swearing?&#x201D; he responds by swearing that he did not swear, because he is so habituated to swearing. For he prefaces anything he says by saying, &#x201C;I swear.&#x201D; They<sup><xref rid="fn3647">227</xref></sup> think that this is an elegant way to speak.<sup><xref rid="fn3648">228</xref></sup></p>
<p>If Israel was guilty only of this sin it would be cause enough to prolong the exile and add blows to our blows. I will now demonstrate their madness. For a murderer who kills his enemy satisfies his impulses by exacting vengeance. Similarly the adulterer for the moment. Likewise the thief who finds pleasures for his needs, and the false witness who does so to gain favor or revenge. Now the one who is constantly swearing, although there is no need for him to do so publicly, desecrates the name of God without deriving any benefit from his act.</p>
<p>8. REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY TO KEEP IT HOLY. The meaning of <italic>to keep it holy</italic> is explained by what follows, namely, <italic>Six days shalt thou labor.</italic> Scripture similarly explains the meaning of <italic>and hallowed it</italic> (v. 11) by going on to say that God rested on the seventh day from all of His work. The reason the sanctification of the Sabbath is here connected to <italic>the Lord blessed</italic> [<italic>the sabbath day</italic>], as it is in the chapter opening with the words <italic>were finished</italic> (Gen. 2:1), is that God sanctified this day and prepared it so that the souls<sup><xref rid="fn3649">229</xref></sup> would receive an infusion of wisdom above that of the other days. That is why Scripture states <italic>the Lord blessed</italic> [<italic>the sabbath day</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn3650">230</xref></sup> I have already explained this in my comments <italic>on A Psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3651">231</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have seen<sup><xref rid="fn3652">232</xref></sup> that the sabbatical year is similar to the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn3653">233</xref></sup> It too is a seventh, that is, it falls every seven years. God commanded that the Torah be read at the beginning of the year<sup><xref rid="fn3654">234</xref></sup> in the presence of the men, women, and little ones. The reason for this is <italic>that they may hear, and that they may learn&#x2026;and observe to do all the words of this law</italic> (Deut. 31:12). Now the Sabbath was given<sup><xref rid="fn3655">235</xref></sup> for understanding the works of God and the study of His Torah. Scripture thus states,<sup><xref rid="fn3656">236</xref></sup> <italic>For Thou, Lord, hast me glad through Thy work</italic> (Ps. 92:5).<sup><xref rid="fn3657">237</xref></sup> A person is occupied with his needs all the days of the week. However, it is only right that he separate himself on the Sabbath and rest for the sake of God&#x2019;s glory. He should not occupy himself with vanity by spending his time seeking advice, even if it concerns his past needs. He should similarly not seek counsel about what he should do in the future. The prophet similarly said, <italic>Nor pursuing thy business,</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3658">238</xref></sup> <italic>nor speaking thereof</italic> (Is. 58:13).</p>
<p>It was customary for the Israelites to travel before the onset of the Sabbath to where the prophets lived, as indicated in <italic>Wherefore wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new moon nor sabbath</italic> (II Kings 4:23).</p>
<p>I have<sup><xref rid="fn3659">239</xref></sup> already noted that whosoever does any work on the Sabbath is in essence denying creation. However, such an individual does not deny the existence of God the revered.<sup><xref rid="fn3660">240</xref></sup></p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the word <italic>thou</italic> includes all those who are obligated to observe the commandments. Hence <italic>nor thy son, nor thy daughter</italic> (v. 10) refers to small children for whose rest their father is responsible. Scripture tells us that we are obligated to guard them<sup><xref rid="fn3661">241</xref></sup> lest they do anything on the Sabbath that we are prohibited from doing. The same applies to <italic>nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant</italic> who is in our power. We our obligated to guard him and not allow him to do any work for another party; otherwise, we violate a negative commandment,<sup><xref rid="fn3662">242</xref></sup> so <italic>that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou</italic> (Deut. 5:14). This was explained by Moses our master in the way we have noted.<sup><xref rid="fn3663">243</xref></sup> It is only on this condition that the stranger may dwell in our gates, namely, that the stranger does not do any work on the Sabbath and on Yom Kippur.<sup><xref rid="fn3664">244</xref></sup> Hence the stranger is also mentioned in the second version.<sup><xref rid="fn3665">245</xref></sup> It is the same case with the sexual prohibitions.<sup><xref rid="fn3666">246</xref></sup> The stranger may dwell among us only if he observes the sexual prohibitions. Likewise with regard to eating blood.<sup><xref rid="fn3667">247</xref></sup></p>
<p>When reading the Book of Jeremiah we noticed that the prophet was very strict about the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn3668">248</xref></sup> The prophet explicitly stated that if Israel returns to Sabbath observance and keeps the Sabbath as they were commanded to, then even though the decree that Jerusalem be destroyed was issued, they would not be exiled from their place, and the thrones of the Davidic dynasty would remain standing in Jerusalem.<sup><xref rid="fn3669">249</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. HONOR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER, AS THE LORD THY GOD COMMANDED THEE. I have already noted that the Lord&#x2019;s name is mentioned in the first five statements. In all of these statements we find the form, <italic>the Lord thy God.</italic></p>
<p>[THAT THY DAYS MAY BE LONG.] The word <italic>ya&#x2019;arikhun</italic> (may be long) is a transitive verb. Its meaning is that one&#x2019;s parents will be the cause of one&#x2019;s days being long.<sup><xref rid="fn3670">250</xref></sup> The term <italic>ta&#x2019;arikhu</italic> (ye may prolong) in <italic>and that ye may prolong your days</italic> (Deut. 11:9) and <italic>ve-ha&#x2019;arakhta</italic> (that thou mayest prolong) in <italic>and that thou mayest prolong thy days</italic> (Deut. 22:7) are proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn3671">251</xref></sup> You will find that because of the commandment which you observe, you lengthen your days.<sup><xref rid="fn3672">252</xref></sup></p>
<p>[UPON THE LAND.] Scripture reads, <italic>upon the land</italic> because if Israel observes this commandment they will not be exiled from the land. The prophet Ezekiel similarly states, <italic>In thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3673">253</xref></sup> <italic>have they made light of father and mother</italic> (Ezek. 22:7). The commandment <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother</italic> means that we should not do the opposite; that is, we should not curse or make light of our parents. Now one who curses his parents incurs the death penalty because people hear the curse come out of his mouth.<sup><xref rid="fn3674">254</xref></sup> However, this penalty does not apply to one who disrespects his parents, for one can do so in secret. Therefore the one who is disrespectful to his parents falls under a curse like all those who are listed as cursed,<sup><xref rid="fn3675">255</xref></sup> for their deeds were done in secret.</p>
<p>13. THOU SHALT NOT MURDER. With your hand or your tongue, that is, by giving false testimony which results in having someone executed, or by tale bearing,<sup><xref rid="fn3676">256</xref></sup> or by wickedly giving someone counsel which you know will result in his death, or by not revealing a secret which you are aware of, to someone who would be saved if he knew what you know. If you do not reveal the secret you are a murderer.</p>
<p>THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY. Many think that the term <italic>ni&#x2019;uf</italic> (adultery) only applies to adultery<sup><xref rid="fn3677">257</xref></sup> because they found Scripture stating, <italic>asher yinaf et eshet re&#x2019;ehu</italic> (even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor&#x2019;s wife) (Lev. 20:10). What reason is there to state this, having just said, <italic>asher yinaf eshet ish</italic> (that committeth adultery with another man&#x2019;s wife)?<sup><xref rid="fn3678">258</xref></sup> However, its meaning is not as they think.<sup><xref rid="fn3679">259</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the previous verse reads, <italic>For whatsoever man there be that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him</italic> (Lev. 20:9). Its meaning is,<sup><xref rid="fn3680">260</xref></sup> he committed a great sin in cursing his parents who bore him. The same is true <italic>even of he that committeth adultery with his neighbor&#x2019;s wife,</italic> whom<sup><xref rid="fn3681">261</xref></sup> he is obligated to love as himself. The word <italic>ni&#x2019;uf</italic> refers to an illicit sexual act. Behold, we find that Scripture states, <italic>va-tinaf et ha-even ve-et ha-etz</italic> (and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks) (Jer. 3:9).<sup><xref rid="fn3682">262</xref></sup> However, it is unfit to discuss this abomination publicly.<sup><xref rid="fn3683">263</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon says that there are many levels of illicit sexual acts. The least illicit level is sleeping with a virgin or widow.<sup><xref rid="fn3684">264</xref></sup> Next comes sleeping with one&#x2019;s wife during her menstrual cycle, for she will be permitted to him in a few days. Then comes sleeping with someone else&#x2019;s wife, for it is possible that her husband will die and she will be permitted to him. Next comes sleeping with a Canaanite woman,<sup><xref rid="fn3685">265</xref></sup> who does not follow Israelite law, without giving her seed, for it is possible that she will convert and he can then marry her. However, if he gives her seed then it is as if he himself is worshipping idols. Next comes sleeping with a male, which can never be permitted. Next comes bestiality, that is, intercourse with a nonhuman. The Gaon knew how to classify the various types of illicit intercourse,<sup><xref rid="fn3686">266</xref></sup> for Scripture decrees the penalty of <italic>karet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3687">267</xref></sup> for all of the illicit sexual acts listed in the Torah portion <italic>Achare Mot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3688">268</xref></sup> Saadiah omitted intercourse with one&#x2019;s mother, sister, and daughter from his list of different levels of illicit sexual acts.<sup><xref rid="fn3689">269</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU SHALT NOT STEAL. Stealing implies taking money secretly. There are thieves who incur the death penalty, namely, those who kidnap an Israelite, be he a child or one who cannot speak clearly.<sup><xref rid="fn3690">270</xref></sup> The prohibition to steal money applies both to when the owner is present and to when he is not present. It also applies to cheating in number, measure, and weight. The term stealing also applies to what Absalom did,<sup><xref rid="fn3691">271</xref></sup> that is, it prohibits deceiving another person.</p>
<p>THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS. For many years I asked myself why Scripture employs the phrase <italic>ed sheker</italic> (false witness) and not <italic>edut sheker</italic> (false testimony). I now believe that Scripture is addressing the false witness, and our verse is to be interpreted as if it read, &#x201C;Thou shalt not give testimony if thou art a false witness.&#x201D; The implication of this clause is the same as that of <italic>neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another</italic> (Lev. 19:11). We find that a <italic>bet</italic> follows the word for testimony in <italic>and hath testified</italic> (anah) <italic>falsely against his brother</italic> (be-achiv) (Deut. 19:18). We also find this verb employed without a <italic>bet</italic> following it in <italic>yishma El ve-ya&#x2019;anem</italic> (God shall hear, and testify against them) (Ps. 55:20).<sup><xref rid="fn3692">272</xref></sup> Now <italic>ve-ya&#x2019;anem</italic> is a compound of <italic>ve-ya&#x2019;aneh</italic> (and shall testify) and <italic>bam</italic> (against them).<sup><xref rid="fn3693">273</xref></sup> The phrase <italic>lo nega&#x2019;anukha</italic> (not touched thee) in <italic>as we have not touched thee</italic> (Gen. 26:29) is similar, as the meaning of <italic>lo nega&#x2019;anukha</italic> is <italic>lo naganu bakh</italic> (we have not touched thee).<sup><xref rid="fn3694">274</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a type of false witness who incurs the death penalty, namely, the one concerning whom it is written, <italic>then shall ye do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother</italic> (Deut. 19:19).<sup><xref rid="fn3695">275</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. THOU SHALT NOT COVET. Many people are amazed at this commandment. They ask, how is it possible for a person not to covet in his heart all beautiful things that appear desirable to him? I will now give you a parable.<sup><xref rid="fn3696">276</xref></sup> Note, a peasant of sound mind who sees a beautiful princess will not entertain any covetous thoughts about sleeping with her, for he knows that this is an impossibility. This peasant will not think like the insane who desire to sprout wings and fly to the sky, for it is impossible to do so. Now just as a man does not desire to sleep with his mother, although she be beautiful, because he has been trained from his childhood to know that she is prohibited to him, so must every intelligent person know that a person does not acquire a beautiful woman or money because of his intelligence or wisdom, but only in accordance with what God has apportioned to him. Indeed, Koheleth states, <italic>yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion</italic> (Eccles. 2:21). Furthermore, our sages taught, children, life, and sustenance are not dependent upon a person&#x2019;s merits but upon the stars.<sup><xref rid="fn3697">277</xref></sup> The intelligent person will therefore neither desire nor covet. Once he knows that God has prohibited his neighbor&#x2019;s wife to him she will be more exalted in his eyes than the princess is in the eyes of the peasant. He will therefore be happy with his lot and will not allow his heart to covet and desire anything which is not his. For he knows that that which God did not want to give him, he cannot acquire by his own strength, thoughts, or schemes. He will therefore trust in his creator, that is, that his creator will sustain him and do what is right in His sight.</p>
<p>Observe, we have completed explaining the Ten Statements.</p>
<p>One of the wise men of this generation said: We know that nine spheres<sup><xref rid="fn3698">278</xref></sup> correspond to the nine numbers<sup><xref rid="fn3699">279</xref></sup> that are the basis of all numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn3700">280</xref></sup> It is the same with these nine statements.<sup><xref rid="fn3701">281</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the first statement, which corresponds to the glory of God the revered who speaks, is not included among the nine statements, for it is the first of the ten in number.<sup><xref rid="fn3702">282</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the second statement, which is <italic>Thou shalt have no</italic>&#x2026;etc. (v. 3), corresponds to the highest sphere, which moves west to east and propels the other spheres to make a twenty-four hour east-to-west circuit in contrast to its own motion.<sup><xref rid="fn3703">283</xref></sup> It is in reference to this sphere that Scripture states, <italic>other gods.</italic> It says this to let us know that the spheres run by the power of God. Many considered this sphere to be the creator because it is incorporeal.</p>
<p>The third statement, namely, <italic>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</italic> (v. 7), corresponds to the sphere of the constellations wherein are all the hosts of heaven, with the exception of the seven moving stars.<sup><xref rid="fn3704">284</xref></sup> Now this important sphere encompasses all the forty-eight bodies<sup><xref rid="fn3705">285</xref></sup> and their forms.<sup><xref rid="fn3706">286</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s power is there revealed to the eye.<sup><xref rid="fn3707">287</xref></sup> There are places in this sphere which contain many stars. There are other places in it which have no stars. It is impossible for a man to know this secret. Many of those deficient in wisdom think that these forms in their arrangement were created in vain.<sup><xref rid="fn3708">288</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fourth statement, the statement about the Sabbath, corresponds to the sphere of Saturn. The astrologers<sup><xref rid="fn3709">289</xref></sup> tell us that each one of the moving stars has a certain day in the week in which its power is manifest.<sup><xref rid="fn3710">290</xref></sup> The star is the dominant power the first hour of the day.<sup><xref rid="fn3711">291</xref></sup> The same is true concerning the star which is the dominant power in the first hour of the night.<sup><xref rid="fn3712">292</xref></sup> They say that Saturn and Mars are harmful stars. Hence harm befalls anyone who begins any work or sets out on a journey when one or the other dominates. The sages therefore said that permission was given for harming<sup><xref rid="fn3713">293</xref></sup> on Wednesday night<sup><xref rid="fn3714">294</xref></sup> and on the eve of the Sabbath. Now we do not find these two &#x201C;demons&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3715">295</xref></sup> ruling night and day, back to back, on any other day of the week except for Saturday.<sup><xref rid="fn3716">296</xref></sup> It is therefore unfit for one to occupy himself on Saturday with everyday matters. On the contrary, one should devote himself on this day to the fear of God.</p>
<p>The fifth statement, namely, <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother,</italic> corresponds to the sphere of Jupiter,<sup><xref rid="fn3717">297</xref></sup> which indicates peace, righteousness, mercy, and the obligation to reward and honor those to whom we owe a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>The sixth statement, <italic>Thou shalt not murder,</italic> corresponds to the sphere of Mars, which points to bloodshed and wounding.</p>
<p>There is a difference of opinion among the astrologers about whether Venus is above or below<sup><xref rid="fn3718">298</xref></sup> the sun. The wise men of India brought proof that Venus is above.<sup><xref rid="fn3719">299</xref></sup> Now the seventh statement, namely, <italic>Thou shalt not commit adultery,</italic> corresponds to the sphere of Venus, the nature of which points to all acts of intercourse and harlotry.</p>
<p>The eighth statement, namely, <italic>Thou shalt not steal,</italic> corresponds to the sphere of the sun and indicates force. It removes the power of any planet<sup><xref rid="fn3720">300</xref></sup> that is in conjunction with it so that its light is not seen.</p>
<p>Now the ninth statement, namely, <italic>Thou shalt not bear false witness,</italic> corresponds to the sphere of Mercury, which indicates language.<sup><xref rid="fn3721">301</xref></sup></p>
<p>The tenth statement, namely, <italic>Thou shalt not covet,</italic> clearly corresponds to the sphere of the moon, which is the lowest of the spheres. It indicates desire.</p>
<p>15. AND ALL THE PEOPLE PERCEIVED THE THUNDERINGS.<sup><xref rid="fn3722">302</xref></sup> I have already explained the meaning of &#x201C;saw the thunderings.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3723">303</xref></sup> Scripture says the aforementioned because all the senses are perceived in one place.<sup><xref rid="fn3724">304</xref></sup> Now the meaning of our verse is: when Israel saw these wonders, that is, when the people perceived the thunderings and the lightning, which people normally fear, and the voice of the horn, a sound such as had never been heard of before, and the mountain smoking, they trembled. The meaning of <italic>va-yanu&#x2019;u</italic> (and they trembled) is, and they moved; that is, each one of them turned from where he was standing and went backwards. <italic>Va-yanu&#x2019;u</italic> is similar to the word <italic>na</italic> (a fugitive) in <italic>a fugitive and a wanderer</italic> (Gen. 4:12). The word <italic>va-yanu&#x2019;u</italic> (were moved) in <italic>And the posts</italic> (amot) <italic>of the door</italic> (ha-sippim) <italic>were moved</italic> (Is. 6:4) is similar. The meaning of <italic>amot</italic> (posts) in the aforementioned verse is cubits, for the thresholds<sup><xref rid="fn3725">305</xref></sup> moved a number of cubits from their place.<sup><xref rid="fn3726">306</xref></sup> The prophet was not able to estimate, in his vision, how many cubits they moved. It is impossible to maintain that <italic>va-yanu&#x2019;u</italic> means: and they trembled. For if Israel did not remove themselves from their place, how did they stand far off?</p>
<p>16. AND THEY SAID. The reference is to the priests and the heads of the tribes who were close to Moses. They spoke to Moses after the Ten Statements were completed because they were very anxious, for they feared that God would continue to speak to them and that they would consequently die. That is why Moses told them, <italic>Fear not</italic> (v. 17).</p>
<p>17. AND MOSES SAID. The <italic>lamed</italic> in the word <italic>le-va&#x2019;avor</italic> (for) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn3727">307</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>lamed</italic> in the word <italic>le-mabbarishonah</italic> (at the first) (I Chron. 15:13) and the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>le-avshalom</italic> (Absalom) in <italic>Absalom the son of Maacah</italic> (I Chron. 3:2).</p>
<p>[TO PROVE YOU.] <italic>To prove you</italic> is similar in meaning to <italic>and that He might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end</italic> (Deut. 8:16).</p>
<p>AND THAT HIS FEAR MAY BE BEFORE YOU. As it is written, <italic>the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb</italic> (Deut. 4:10).<sup><xref rid="fn3728">308</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND THE PEOPLE STOOD AFAR OFF. Scripture mentions this a second time because Moses did the opposite. They stood from afar; however, Moses drew near the thick darkness.</p>
<p>19. AND THE LORD SAID. Many err because they found Scripture stating, <italic>and thou didst hear His words out of the midst of the fire</italic> (Deut. 4:36) that God was on Mount Sinai, for it is written, <italic>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai</italic> (Ex. 19:20). However, Scripture here states, <italic>I have talked with you from heaven.</italic></p>
<p>Now he who is intelligent will understand its meaning from my comments on the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3729">309</xref></sup> What I will now do is offer a parable. Perhaps this will help the unintelligent understand. Imagine the form of a person standing with his feet on Mount Sinai and his head in heaven. This is the meaning of <italic>And the Lord came down</italic> (Ex. 19:20) and of God&#x2019;s speaking from heaven. It is similar to <italic>And His feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives</italic> (Zech. 14:4), for we know that God&#x2019;s glory fills heaven and earth.<sup><xref rid="fn3730">310</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. YE SHALL NOT MAKE WITH ME. Its meaning is: Look, I who dwell in heaven spoke to you without any intermediary.<sup><xref rid="fn3731">311</xref></sup> Indeed, Scripture explicitly states, <italic>The Lord spoke with you face to face</italic> (Deut. 5:4).</p>
<p>Do not be perplexed because Scripture repeats, <italic>ye shall not make</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3732">312</xref></sup> Scripture is following elegant Hebrew style. It is similar to <italic>Thou shalt not covet</italic> (v. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn3733">313</xref></sup> It all has one meaning,<sup><xref rid="fn3734">314</xref></sup> to be read as follows: &#x201C;Ye shall not make with Me gods of silver, or gods of gold.&#x201D; It is like <italic>Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image</italic> (v. 4). Its meaning is: do not make forms that receive powers from above and think that you make them for My glory, in that they will serve as an intermediary between Me and you, like the golden calf which Israel made. As I will explain in its place, Aaron made the golden calf for God&#x2019;s glory.<sup><xref rid="fn3735">315</xref></sup> God warned Israel at the beginning<sup><xref rid="fn3736">316</xref></sup> not to make gods of gold because He knew that Israel would make the golden calf. The meaning of <italic>with Me</italic> thus is: I have no need for intermediaries to be with Me. Scripture therefore states afterwards, <italic>I will come unto thee and bless thee.</italic> Its meaning is, through My glory I will come unto thee.</p>
<p>21. AN ALTAR OF STONE.<sup><xref rid="fn3737">317</xref></sup> Some say that the reason<sup><xref rid="fn3738">318</xref></sup> is that they not make images on the altar. Scripture therefore commanded that the altar be constructed from unhewn stones. Perhaps these commentators can explain why the entire tabernacle was adorned with cherubim and why cherubim of gold were placed over the arkcover. Furthermore, the entire temple constructed by Solomon was decorated with cherubim, images,<sup><xref rid="fn3739">319</xref></sup> and open flowers (I Kings 6:32). These places were more important than the place of the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn3740">320</xref></sup> I will speak on this in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa.</italic></p>
<p>Some say that the meaning of <italic>An altar of earth</italic> is that the altar shall not be constructed on a high place. However, this is not what the words imply. The fact that Scripture goes on to state next, <italic>And if thou make Me an altar of stone</italic> is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn3741">321</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our sages said that <italic>An altar of earth</italic> means that the bronze altar<sup><xref rid="fn3742">322</xref></sup> is to be filled with earth. They spoke the truth, for that is what they did. However, this verse serves only as a reminder<sup><xref rid="fn3743">323</xref></sup> and as a support.<sup><xref rid="fn3744">324</xref></sup> This<sup><xref rid="fn3745">325</xref></sup> is not its literal meaning. The earth that was placed in the altar was not essential,<sup><xref rid="fn3746">326</xref></sup> and the altar<sup><xref rid="fn3747">327</xref></sup> was known only as the bronze altar. It was so named because it was made out of bronze. The altar of incense<sup><xref rid="fn3748">328</xref></sup> was also called the gold altar because it was covered with gold.<sup><xref rid="fn3749">329</xref></sup> Furthermore, if the implication of <italic>An altar of earth</italic> is an altar filled with earth, then the meaning of <italic>an altar of stone</italic> is an altar filled with stones. However, we cannot say that the altar<sup><xref rid="fn3750">330</xref></sup> was not constructed of stones, for Scripture explicitly tells us that it was made out of stones.<sup><xref rid="fn3751">331</xref></sup> The reference<sup><xref rid="fn3752">332</xref></sup> is to the altar made on Mount Ebal.</p>
<p>I will now explain. Saadiah Gaon says that there is a difference of opinion concerning the altar that Moses built beneath Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn3753">333</xref></sup> Some say that he built the altar before the giving of the Torah. Others maintain that he built it afterwards. The Gaon agrees with the first opinion. He says that what Scripture records in this chapter, namely, the chapter which contains the words <italic>All that the Lord hath spoken we will do</italic> (Ex. 19:8), is repeated in the second chapter, that is, in the chapter that reads, <italic>All that the Lord hath spoken will we do, and obey</italic> (Ex. 24:7).<sup><xref rid="fn3754">334</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will prove to you conclusively that Moses built the altar after the giving of the Torah. This chapter clearly states that God told Moses, when he went up to the mountain of God prior to the giving of the Torah, <italic>Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians&#x2026;Now therefore, if ye will hearken unto My voice</italic> (Ex. 19:4, 5). God started by saying, <italic>Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob</italic> (Ex. 19:3). Now Moses did not relate<sup><xref rid="fn3755">335</xref></sup> any commandments, statutes, or ordinances to Israel. He merely wanted to hear from their very lips whether they wanted to listen to God&#x2019;s voice and do what He commanded them. Israel replied by saying, <italic>we will do</italic> (Ex. 19:8). Scripture then goes on to report, <italic>And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord</italic> (Ex. 19:9). Moses then sanctified Israel so that they would be fit to hear God&#x2019;s word, which consisted of the Ten Statements. He now<sup><xref rid="fn3756">336</xref></sup> started to instruct the people in God&#x2019;s commandments.</p>
<p>When Moses approached the thick darkness God told him everything stated in the section that begins, <italic>Ye shall not make with Me</italic> (v. 20)<sup><xref rid="fn3757">337</xref></sup> and the entire chapter of <italic>Now these are the ordinances</italic> (Ex. 21:1) up to, <italic>for they will be a snare unto thee</italic> (Ex. 23:33). Scripture then tells us, <italic>And Moses came</italic> (Ex. 24:3); that is, he came down from the mountain. Scripture then goes on to state, <italic>and</italic> [<italic>Moses</italic>] <italic>told the people all the words of the Lord and all the ordinances</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>). <italic>The words of the Lord</italic> refers to the positive and negative commandments, starting with <italic>Ye shall not make with Me&#x2014;gods of silver</italic> (v. 20); the account of the altar and all the positive and negative commandments found in the chapter that begins, <italic>And these are the Ordinances,</italic> such as <italic>thou shalt surely bring it back to him again</italic> (Ex. 23:4); <italic>thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down</italic> (Ex. 22:25), and <italic>Thou shalt not revile God</italic> (Ex. 22:27). The ordinances refer to the laws dealing with slavery, assault, fights, goring, arson, theft, oaths. It is concerning these that Scripture there writes, <italic>and all the ordinances</italic> (Ex. 24:3). It is concerning these laws that our forefathers said, <italic>will we do, and obey</italic> (Ex. 24:7). The meaning of <italic>will we do</italic> is, we will observe the positive and the negative commandments. The meaning of <italic>and obey</italic> is: we will obey the ordinances. The Israelites therefore added <italic>and obey,</italic> something which they at first<sup><xref rid="fn3758">338</xref></sup> did not say<sup><xref rid="fn3759">339</xref></sup> following the giving of the Torah.</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>An altar of earth</italic> clearly is, as the phrase implies, an altar made out of earth. This is what Scripture refers to when it writes later, <italic>and builded an altar under the mount</italic> (Ex. 24:4). Scripture here writes, <italic>and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings</italic> (v. 21), and it is there written, [and they] <italic>offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings</italic> (Ex. 24:5).<sup><xref rid="fn3760">340</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no doubt that the section beginning, <italic>An altar of earth</italic> and also <italic>Ye shall not make with Me</italic> (v. 20) were stated because of the blood of the covenant which Moses dashed on the altar (Ex. 24:6) and because the people pledged that the Lord alone would be their God and that they would observe His commandments and ordinances (Ex. 24:7).</p>
<p>Scripture mentions, <italic>thy sheep, and thine oxen</italic> (v. 21) because both of them are kinds of animals from which burnt offerings and peace offerings may be brought.<sup><xref rid="fn3761">341</xref></sup></p>
<p>I saw a heretic, may his bones be crushed, arguing against the sages of the Talmud for saying, <italic>Which was the place appointed for the sacrifices</italic> (<italic>Zevachim</italic> 5:1).<sup><xref rid="fn3762">342</xref></sup> The heretic claimed that he never found the Torah using the term sacrifice (<italic>zevach</italic>) except for a peace offering.<sup><xref rid="fn3763">343</xref></sup> We thus find Scripture speaking of a burnt offering and sacrifices (<italic>zevachim</italic>). The burnt offering is an entity unto itself, and sacrifices refer only to peace offerings, as in [and they] <italic>offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto the Lord</italic> (Ex. 24:5). We<sup><xref rid="fn3764">344</xref></sup> find this to be the case all over. Now I showed this heretic that what he said was incorrect. Scripture here states, <italic>and shalt sacrifice</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3765">345</xref></sup> <italic>thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings.</italic> He then admitted that he sinned in contradicting people eminently greater than any who lived in all the generations that came after them.</p>
<p>[IN EVERY PLACE WHERE I CAUSE MY NAME TO BE MENTIONED.] Its meaning and interpretation is, in every place where I will set a memorial for My name, that is, in every place where My glory dwells such as Shilo and Nob where the ark stood. If you come to the aforementioned place for the sake of My name to visit Me, I too will come unto you and bless you.</p>
<p>[I WILL COME UNTO THEE.] This is an anthropomorphism. Its meaning is: you will find Me in the place upon which I cause My name to be mentioned, which is the place of My glory.<sup><xref rid="fn3766">346</xref></sup> I, as it were, came to you because I knew that you would come and it is because of you that I came. Furthermore, because you came to pay Me homage, <italic>I will come unto thee and bless thee.</italic> You will have no need to seek anyone else, for you will find Me as long as My glory is there.</p>
<p>22. AND IF THOU MAKE ME AN ALTAR OF STONE. The altar that Moses built to make a covenant with Israel with the blood of the covenant<sup><xref rid="fn3767">347</xref></sup> [was made out of earth].<sup><xref rid="fn3768">348</xref></sup></p>
<p>God commanded<sup><xref rid="fn3769">349</xref></sup> that Israel build an altar of stone on the other side of the Jordan before they would inherit the land and that they write the entire Torah upon the stones, because many of the commandments are contingent upon the Land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3770">350</xref></sup> We similarly find that God required their children<sup><xref rid="fn3771">351</xref></sup> to build such an altar when they entered the land<sup><xref rid="fn3772">352</xref></sup> because of the commandments contingent upon the Land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3773">353</xref></sup> They sacrificed and ate peace offerings there<sup><xref rid="fn3774">354</xref></sup> as their fathers did.<sup><xref rid="fn3775">355</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the above, the meaning of <italic>And if thou make an altar of stone</italic> is, now build an altar of earth. However, if you are worthy to enter the Land of Israel, then you will make Me an altar of stone.</p>
<p>IT.<sup><xref rid="fn3776">356</xref></sup> The reference is to the stones.</p>
<p>HEWN STONES. Its meaning is similar to that of <italic>but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man</italic> (Ex. 33:11).<sup><xref rid="fn3777">357</xref></sup> Similarly here, <italic>lo tivneh ethem gazit</italic> (do not build a hewn structure out of them).<sup><xref rid="fn3778">358</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>gazit</italic> (hewn stones) comes from the same root as <italic>gozeze</italic> (shearers) in <italic>and went up unto his sheep-shearers</italic> (Gen. 38:12) and <italic>gaz</italic> (cut) in, <italic>For it is speedily cut, and we fly away</italic> (Ps. 90:10).<sup><xref rid="fn3779">359</xref></sup> It is the same case with <italic>nagozu</italic> (cut) in <italic>Even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away</italic> (Nahum 1:12). Its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn3780">360</xref></sup> is, cut.<sup><xref rid="fn3781">361</xref></sup> Only unhewn stones, that is, stones as God created them, [were to be used].</p>
<p>FOR IF THOU LIFTED UP THY TOOL UPON IT. The word <italic>cherev</italic> (tool) refers to an iron instrument made for cutting.<sup><xref rid="fn3782">362</xref></sup> It is possible that the instrument is called a <italic>cherev</italic> because it destroys (<italic>mecharevet</italic>). Scripture elsewhere states, <italic>thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon them</italic> (Deut. 27:5),<sup><xref rid="fn3783">363</xref></sup> that is, upon the altar of stones that Israel built.<sup><xref rid="fn3784">364</xref></sup></p>
<p>We should not look for explanations for the commandments. However, from a rational point of view it is possible that the prohibition against hewn stones is similar to the law governing &#x201C;a vile thing.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3785">365</xref></sup> It is unseemly for that which is left over from a sacrifice which was brought upon the altar to become vile, for if what remains of a sacrifice becomes vile then the sacrifice, which was sanctified, is defiled. The same is true of the prohibition against hewn stones. It is possible that the chips that result from the stone-cutting be profaned by being dedicated to idolatrous use if the builders cut stones in order to build an altar. The latter would be disrespectful. Now Scripture states<sup><xref rid="fn3786">366</xref></sup> that the priest atones upon the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn3787">367</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. NEITHER SHALT THOU GO UP BY STEPS UNTO MINE ALTAR. Ben Zuta says that <italic>be-ma&#x2019;alot</italic> (by steps) comes from the same root as <italic>ma&#x2019;al</italic> (trespass).<sup><xref rid="fn3788">368</xref></sup> However, he did not open his eyes and see that the <italic>mem</italic> in <italic>ma&#x2019;al</italic> is a root letter, as <italic>u-ma&#x2019;alah vo ma&#x2019;al</italic> (and act unfaithfully against him) (Num. 5:12) proves.<sup><xref rid="fn3789">369</xref></sup> Now <italic>ma&#x2019;al</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>na&#x2019;al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3790">370</xref></sup> Its plural absolute form is <italic>ne&#x2019;alot</italic> (shoes). Compare, <italic>and worn shoes</italic> (ne&#x2019;alot) <italic>and clouted upon their feet, and worn garments</italic> (Josh. 9:5).

<p>Ben Zuta clearly intended to ascend the ladder of wisdom with his follies. However, his nakedness was uncovered thereon. This is what happens to every heretic who does not believe in the words of our ancient sages.</p>
<p>The law prohibiting the use of steps to go up to the altar takes in all altars of earth, stones, or copper. The phrase <italic>Mine altar</italic> implies all altars made for the Lord.</p>
<ftnote id="fn3421"><sup>1</sup> The Biblical term for what is known in the western world as the Ten Commandments is <italic>aseret ha-devarim</italic> (Deut. 4:13; 10:4), the ten words or the ten statements. This is term that will be employed in this work.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3422"><sup>2</sup> In other words, the first two statements are in the first person while the next three are in the third person. Hence they assume that only the first two were uttered by God. These commentaries also assume that statements 6-10 were spoken by Moses, as it is illogical to assume that God would utter two statements first, that Moses would then utter three statements, and that the Lord would then resume speaking. Thus the first question to be raised i n this chapter is, did God utter all ten statements or only the first two? If he uttered all the statements, why is there a change in person after the first two?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3423"><sup>3</sup> As Jewish tradition does.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3424"><sup>4</sup> In other words, <italic>I am the Lord</italic> is an introductory statement to that which follows. That is, verse 3 is to be understood as follows: I am the Lord thy God&#x2026;who commands you the following.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3432"><sup>12</sup> Why would God refer to himself in the third person (Krinsky)?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3433"><sup>13</sup> If we assume that God told Israel, <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God commanded thee</italic> (Deut. 5:16). The question arises, when before this did God command Israel to honor their parents? The Bible never recorded such a command prior to the revelation at Sinai.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3440"><sup>20</sup> The miracles performed by Moses are based on natural law and thus have some parallel in nature.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3441"><sup>21</sup> It has no parallel in the everyday world.</ftnote>

This type of writing has its own manner, and it differs from the writing which the hand produces on paper.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3446"><sup>26</sup> I.E. is trying to explain why the eye can simultaneously see two words while the ear can only hear one word at a time. He thus explains that sound (words written in the ear) is different from script.</ftnote>

If one hears them at the same time, one does not know what is being said.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3448"><sup>28</sup> The sages should have said that <italic>Observe</italic> and <italic>Remember</italic> were heard simultaneously rather than were said simultaneously.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3480"><sup>60</sup> That is, when to use full or deficient spellings. Levi obviously cannot, for there are no rules regarding the use of full or deficient spellings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3481"><sup>61</sup> I.E. apparently believed that Moses had some discretion in choosing the spelling to be employed in writing the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3482"><sup>62</sup> The questions raised by I.E. at the beginning of his comments on this verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3483"><sup>63</sup> God spoke all ten of them without pause. I.E. takes issue with those who held that only the first two statements were uttered by God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3484"><sup>64</sup> To the contrary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3485"><sup>65</sup> And thus seem to indicate that God did not utter them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3486"><sup>66</sup> As the first and second statements tell you to do.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3487"><sup>67</sup> That is, the reason the third statement is in the second person is that its meaning is: Now that you have accepted the Lord as your God, <italic>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3488"><sup>68</sup> It is to be similarly interpreted. That is, its meaning is: for in six days the Lord, whom you accepted as your God, made heaven and earth. The fifth statement should be similarly interpreted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3489"><sup>69</sup> To start in the first person and then go on to use the third person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3490"><sup>70</sup> <italic>I am the Lord thy God,</italic> etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3491"><sup>71</sup> Hence they cannot be counted as two separate statements.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3492"><sup>72</sup> Publicly and openly accepting another god.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3493"><sup>73</sup> The point is that the fourth statement has a number of sub-statements; however, it is all considered one statement. The same must apply to the prohibition against worshipping idols.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3494"><sup>74</sup> They count verse 3 and verse 4 as the first statement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3495"><sup>75</sup> The import of this verse is, no one will steal your land. According to this interpretation the first half of verse 14 deals with theft and the second part with desire.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3496"><sup>76</sup> For people only covet that which is desirable. Thus to tell Israel that no one will covet their land is to tell Israel that their land will be undesirable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3497"><sup>77</sup> In Deut. 5:18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3498"><sup>78</sup> The meaning of <italic>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3499"><sup>79</sup> That is, that its meaning is also: thou shalt not desire (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3500"><sup>80</sup> Like the interpretation which lists verses 3 and 4 as two independent statements.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3501"><sup>81</sup> That is, the other things listed in verse 14.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3503"><sup>83</sup> Whenever Scripture repeats an account or a dictum.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3504"><sup>84</sup> The idea is the same although the words are different.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3505"><sup>85</sup> That Scripture preserves meanings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3506"><sup>86</sup> When Isaac did not say this.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3509"><sup>89</sup> According to Saadiah Gaon each tablet contained a different version of the Ten Statements. One tablet corresponded to the version of Exodus and one tablet corresponded to the version in Deuteronomy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3510"><sup>90</sup> Deut. 5:14,15. According to I.E. the meaning of the aforementioned is, as the Lord thy God commanded thee in the Ten Statements, the reference being to the first version.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3511"><sup>91</sup> That the second version is Mosaic.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3512"><sup>92</sup> If one does not remember, he cannot observe.</ftnote>

<p>1. NOW THESE ARE THE ORDINANCES. After the children of Israel told Moses, <italic>Speak thou with us</italic>, etc. (Ex. 20:16), God told Moses, when Moses drew near to the thick darkness,<sup><xref rid="fn3796">2</xref></sup> <italic>Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel</italic>, etc. (Ex. 20:19). God began to warn them against making golden gods.<sup><xref rid="fn3797">3</xref></sup> He told Moses that upon Moses&#x2019; descent from Mount Sinai, He would make a covenant with Israel to the effect that the Lord alone would be their God.<sup><xref rid="fn3798">4</xref></sup> God taught Moses the ordinances and commandments<sup><xref rid="fn3799">5</xref></sup> so that Moses would tell Israel, if you accept these ordinances and commandments then God will make a covenant with you. At the end of these conditions,<sup><xref rid="fn3800">6</xref></sup> God told Moses the portion of <italic>Behold, I send an angel before thee</italic> (Ex. 23:20). The most important part of the latter chapter is the elimination of idol worship from their country when they entered it. Moses explained this to Israel before he made the covenant,<sup><xref rid="fn3801">7</xref></sup> for Moses concluded with, <italic>neither shalt thou serve their gods</italic> (Deut. 7:16).<sup><xref rid="fn3802">8</xref></sup> Now the portion opens with the prohibition against making other gods alongside the Lord<sup><xref rid="fn3803">9</xref></sup> and concludes with the commandment to uproot the memory of idols and molten gods which were made in the land of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn3804">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. IF THOU BUY. Before I begin to explain<sup><xref rid="fn3805">11</xref></sup> let me give you a general rule. Each ordinance or commandment<sup><xref rid="fn3806">12</xref></sup> is an independent unit. If we are able to find a reason that two ordinances or commandments are connected to each other, then we will expend all of our efforts to connect them. If we are not able to do so, we will conclude that the reason this cannot be done is our intellectual deficiency.<sup><xref rid="fn3807">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is nothing in the world more difficult for a human being to bear than to be under the control of another person like himself. Scripture therefore began<sup><xref rid="fn3808">14</xref></sup> with the law of the Hebrew servant. Our sages said that the Hebrew servant<sup><xref rid="fn3809">15</xref></sup> is an Israelite. The same applies to <italic>And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant</italic> (v. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn3810">16</xref></sup> However, our sages maintain that <italic>And if a man smite the eye of his bondmen</italic> (v. 26) refers to a Canaanite.<sup><xref rid="fn3811">17</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>If the ox gore a bondman</italic> (v. 32).<sup><xref rid="fn3812">18</xref></sup> And they said that <italic>then he shall be sold for his theft</italic> (Ex. 22:2) refers to an Israelite.</p>
<p>Those who dispute with our sages say that the Hebrew slave<sup><xref rid="fn3813">19</xref></sup> is not an Israelite but rather someone of Abraham&#x2019;s family.<sup><xref rid="fn3814">20</xref></sup> The same is true of the daughter sold into slavery<sup><xref rid="fn3815">21</xref></sup> and of all the slaves mentioned afterwards. They are to be understood in the same way.<sup><xref rid="fn3816">22</xref></sup> Their proof is from <italic>the wife and her children</italic> (v. 4),<sup><xref rid="fn3817">23</xref></sup> for they say that family identity is established by the father.<sup><xref rid="fn3818">24</xref></sup> They offer additional proof from <italic>and he shall serve him for ever</italic> (v. 6), for they say that the latter means all of the slave&#x2019;s life.<sup><xref rid="fn3819">25</xref></sup> It was difficult for them to accept that an Israelite would have his ear pierced.<sup><xref rid="fn3820">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Let us now seek the plain meaning of the words.<sup><xref rid="fn3821">27</xref></sup> If the Hebrew slave is not an Israelite, then why did Scripture state, <italic>If thy brother, a Hebrew man&#x2026;be sold unto thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3822">28</xref></sup> (Deut. 15:12)? Do we not know that brother in <italic>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart</italic> (Lev. 19:17) means an Israelite? It is the same case with <italic>between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him</italic> (Deut. 1:16).<sup><xref rid="fn3823">29</xref></sup> There are many such cases.</p>
<p>Now there is no doubt that the meaning of <italic>Abram the Hebrew</italic> (Gen. 14:13) is: Abram of the children of Eber, about whom Scripture says <italic>avi kol bene ever</italic>, (the father of all the children of Eber) (Gen. 10:21),<sup><xref rid="fn3824">30</xref></sup> in contrast to <italic>and Ham is the father of Canaan</italic> (Gen. 9:18). On the other hand, it is possible that Abram was called the Hebrew because he came from beyond the river,<sup><xref rid="fn3825">31</xref></sup> although in this case the term used should have been <italic>ivri nahari</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn3826">32</xref></sup> rather than <italic>ivri</italic>. Let us assume that Scripture was being brief,<sup><xref rid="fn3827">33</xref></sup> because we find that the Bible states, <italic>And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River</italic> (me-ever ha-nahar) (Josh. 24:3).<sup><xref rid="fn3828">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Hebrews are also called Israelites, for we see that Moses told Pharaoh, <italic>Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel</italic> (Ex. 5:1). However, when Pharaoh asked Moses, &#x201C;Who is this God?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3829">35</xref></sup> Moses answered him, <italic>The God of the Hebrews</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.). The God of the Hebrews thus means the same as the God of Israel. Now if the Israelites are called Hebrews because they are related to Eber, then the children of Ishmael and the children of Keturah<sup><xref rid="fn3830">36</xref></sup> and the children of Esau should be joined to us. However, we do not find Scripture referring to any people as our brothers except for Edom,<sup><xref rid="fn3831">37</xref></sup> who shared one womb with Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn3832">38</xref></sup> We also do not find Scripture referring to Esau<sup><xref rid="fn3833">39</xref></sup> as our brother in commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn3834">40</xref></sup> We find him referred to as a brother only in the account of the messengers.<sup><xref rid="fn3835">41</xref></sup> The same applies to <italic>Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother</italic> (Deut. 23:8)<sup><xref rid="fn3836">42</xref></sup> wherein Scripture mentions <italic>he is thy brother</italic> after first mentioning the term <italic>Edomite</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3837">43</xref></sup> The same is true of <italic>Because he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3838">44</xref></sup><italic> did pursue his brother</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3839">45</xref></sup> <italic>with the sword</italic> (Amos 1:11).<sup><xref rid="fn3840">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now we do not find in all of Scripture the word Hebrew employed except in regard to the children of Jacob. Scripture thus states: <italic>And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew</italic> (Gen. 41:12); <italic>because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews</italic> (Gen. 43:32); <italic>an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew</italic> (Ex. 2:11); <italic>two men of the Hebrews were striving together</italic> (Ex. 2:13). Jonah said, <italic>I am a Hebrew</italic> (Jonah 1:9) because he was asked, <italic>and of what people art thou</italic> (Jonah v. 1:8). If the term Hebrew had referred to many nations, Jonah would not yet have told them of what people he was.<sup><xref rid="fn3841">47</xref></sup> Scripture also states, <italic>that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews</italic> (I Sam. 4:9);<sup><xref rid="fn3842">48</xref></sup> <italic>Now the Hebrews</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3843">49</xref></sup> <italic>that were with the Philistines</italic> (I Sam. 14:21). The book of Jeremiah states: <italic>that every man should let his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, being a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, go free</italic> (Jer. 34:9). The latter closes by explaining, <italic>that none should make bondmen of them, even of a Jew his brother</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.). Now it is known that an Edomite is not called a Jew.<sup><xref rid="fn3844">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Those who disagree with our sages say, look, it is written: <italic>And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews</italic> (mityahadim) (Esther 8:17)<sup><xref rid="fn3845">51</xref></sup> in reference to those who were not Jews. This is blindness. For according to their opinion, whether the meaning of the word <italic>mityahadim</italic> (became Jews) is that they claimed to be Jews or that <italic>mityahadim</italic> means they accepted Judaism,<sup><xref rid="fn3846">52</xref></sup> Scripture should have read, &#x201C;even of one of his brothers who became Jewish.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3847">53</xref></sup> Furthermore, the word <italic>mitabber</italic> (becoming a Hebrew)<sup><xref rid="fn3848">54</xref></sup> should be formed from the word <italic>ivri</italic> according to this interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn3849">55</xref></sup> One who says this, <italic>meddleth</italic> (mitabber) <italic>with strife not his own</italic> (Prov. 26:17).<sup><xref rid="fn3850">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has thus been clearly shown that the words of our sages are correct. We will rely upon them with regard to all of the commandments in accordance with their tradition, which they received from their fathers. Furthermore, how can one think that an Ishmaelite and an Edomite shall serve for six years<sup><xref rid="fn3851">57</xref></sup> and an Israelite until the year of jubilee.<sup><xref rid="fn3852">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>SIX YEARS HE SHALL SERVE. And no longer. It is like <italic>Six years thou shalt sow thy field</italic> (Lev. 25:3).<sup><xref rid="fn3853">59</xref></sup> At the start of the seventh year of his being sold he shall go free no matter what year it be.<sup><xref rid="fn3854">60</xref></sup> Do not be amazed that Jeremiah writes, <italic>At the end of seven years</italic> (Jer. 34:14),<sup><xref rid="fn3855">61</xref></sup> because everything has two ends and sometimes the end is found at the beginning and sometimes it is at the end.<sup><xref rid="fn3856">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our verse deals with a servant whom the law courts have sold, namely, an individual concerning whom it is written, <italic>then he shall be sold for his theft</italic> (Ex. 22:2). However, <italic>And if thy brother be waxen poor with thee, and was sold unto you</italic> (Lev. 25:39)<sup><xref rid="fn3857">63</xref></sup> or <italic>to a stranger</italic> (Lev. 25:47) refers to a slave who sells himself according to the years remaining to the year of jubilee, for such a servant goes out when the Jubilee comes. Israel has a tradition that males but not females are sold because they stole. I will finish the matter in the chapter which follows.</p>
<p>Rabbi Merinus says that the <italic>yod</italic> of the word <italic>la-chofshi</italic> (tree) is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn3858">64</xref></sup> It is like the yod of <italic>le-mishi</italic> (for cleansing) (Ezek. 16:4) and the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>akhzari</italic> (cruel) (Prov. 11:17). However, Rabbi Judah the grammarian says the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>la</italic>-<italic>chofshi</italic> (free) is superfluous because its meaning is similar to <italic>chofshi</italic> (free) in <italic>And when thou lettest him go free</italic> (Deut. 15:13).<sup><xref rid="fn3859">65</xref></sup> Its <italic>yod</italic> is, as it were, the <italic>yod</italic> of relationship, like the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>ha-kadmoni</italic> (of the east gate) (Ezek. 19:19). The <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>la-chofshi</italic> is like the <italic>lamed</italic> of <italic>la-avshalom</italic> (Absalom)<sup><xref rid="fn3860">66</xref></sup> in <italic>the third, Absalom the son of Maacah</italic> (I Chron. 3:2). However, in my opinion the <italic>lamed</italic> and the <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>la-chofshi</italic> are both prepositions, even though one would have sufficed.<sup><xref rid="fn3861">67</xref></sup> <italic>Chofshi</italic> is similar to <italic>ha-oholi</italic> (of my tent) (Josh. 7:21) in <italic>in the midst of my tent</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3862">68</xref></sup> <italic>Chofshi</italic> (free) is an adjective.</p>
<p>[FOR NOTHING.] The word <italic>chinnam</italic> (for nothing) comes from the same root as <italic>channunu</italic> (grant)<sup><xref rid="fn3863">69</xref></sup> in <italic>grant them</italic> (Jud. 21:22). It means a gift.<sup><xref rid="fn3864">70</xref></sup> We do not know why <italic>chinnam</italic> has a <italic>mem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3865">71</xref></sup> Its <italic>mem</italic> is like the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>rekam</italic> (empty) (Gen. 31:42).<sup><xref rid="fn3866">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. IF HE COME IN BY HIMSELF. Some say that the word <italic>be-gappo</italic> (by himself) has the same meaning as <italic>be-gufo</italic> (with his body). Now we find the phrase <italic>gufat sha&#x2019;ul</italic> (the body of Saul) (I Chron. 10:12) in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn3867">73</xref></sup> However, the forms of nouns change.<sup><xref rid="fn3868">74</xref></sup> Others say<sup><xref rid="fn3869">75</xref></sup> that <italic>gappo</italic> (himself) has the meaning of wing. Wings are referred to as <italic>gappin</italic> in Aramaic. It is as if Scripture read, if he came in bondage possessing only the wing of his garment.<sup><xref rid="fn3870">76</xref></sup> However, this is out of context, for the context requires us to explain <italic>be-gappo</italic> as meaning that he carries no other body on his back. <italic>Gappo</italic> is like <italic>gabbi</italic> (my back) in <italic>The plowers plowed upon my back</italic> (Ps. 129:3).<sup><xref rid="fn3871">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that Scripture had to say, <italic>If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3872">78</xref></sup> while saying<sup><xref rid="fn3873">79</xref></sup> <italic>he shall go out free</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3874">80</xref></sup> because of his wife,<sup><xref rid="fn3875">81</xref></sup> that is, the Torah had to say, if he be married.<sup><xref rid="fn3876">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now if an Israelite women is not sold by a law court for theft, why does Scripture say, <italic>then his wife shall go out with him</italic>? It states this to teach us that the one who acquires a Hebrew slave is obligated to support his [the slave&#x2019;s] wife. She is with him until they go out together.</p>
<p>4. IF HIS MASTER GIVE HIM A WIFE. We find that those who employ the holy tongue render honor with various nouns<sup><xref rid="fn3877">83</xref></sup> but not with verbs. They use the terms <italic>adon</italic> (lord) and also <italic>adonim</italic> (lords).<sup><xref rid="fn3878">84</xref></sup> They employ the latter as a singular in a <italic>cruel lord</italic> (adonim) (Is. 19:4). They employ the term <italic>adonav</italic> (his lord)<sup><xref rid="fn3879">85</xref></sup> in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn3880">86</xref></sup> They do not use the term <italic>adono</italic> (his lord),<sup><xref rid="fn3881">87</xref></sup> for we do not find the word <italic>adono</italic> in Scripture. However, <italic>Adoni</italic> (my lord),<sup><xref rid="fn3882">88</xref></sup> as in <italic>My lord asked</italic> (Gen. 44:19), is employed in the first person. It is prohibited to use the plural form<sup><xref rid="fn3883">89</xref></sup> so that it not be confused with God&#x2019;s glorious name.<sup><xref rid="fn3884">90</xref></sup> It is similarly unfit to use the singular declensional form <italic>adoni</italic> (my lord) in <italic>My lord asked</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>) when God is spoken of.<sup><xref rid="fn3885">91</xref></sup> The same applies to the term <italic>Elo&#x2019;ah</italic> (God).<sup><xref rid="fn3886">92</xref></sup> Rabbi Merinus says that <italic>eloho</italic> (their god),<sup><xref rid="fn3887">93</xref></sup> rather than <italic>elohav</italic> (their god),<sup><xref rid="fn3888">94</xref></sup> in <italic>their might unto their god</italic> (Hab. 1:11) is used in a disparaging manner.<sup><xref rid="fn3889">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>IF HIS MASTER GIVE HIM A WIFE. A Canaanite woman according to our sages.<sup><xref rid="fn3890">96</xref></sup> It is possible that the meaning of a Canaanite women is in keeping with <italic>Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you</italic> (Lev. 25:45) conceming whom it is written, <italic>of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids</italic> (Lev. 25:44).<sup><xref rid="fn3891">97</xref></sup> The same applies to all Canaanite slaves,<sup><xref rid="fn3892">98</xref></sup> for Scripture states, <italic>thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth</italic> (Deut. 20:16) with regard to the seven nations.<sup><xref rid="fn3893">99</xref></sup> Scripture states with regard to Solomon, <italic>of the nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of Israel: They shall not come among you, neither shall you go among them</italic> (I Kings 11:2).<sup><xref rid="fn3894">100</xref></sup> Now this is written<sup><xref rid="fn3895">101</xref></sup> with regard to Zidonians and Hittites,<sup><xref rid="fn3896">102</xref></sup> not Moabites and Ammonites.<sup><xref rid="fn3897">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. BUT IF THE SERVANT SHALL PLAINLY SAY. Our sages have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn3898">104</xref></sup> that his ear is not pierced unless all these conditions,<sup><xref rid="fn3899">105</xref></sup> including <italic>because he loveth thee and thy house</italic> (Deut. 15:16), have been fulfilled.<sup><xref rid="fn3900">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. THEN HIS MASTER SHALL BRING HIM UNTO GOD. The term <italic>Elohim</italic> (God) means those who establish God&#x2019;s laws in the land.<sup><xref rid="fn3901">107</xref></sup> It is customary for the judges to sit in the gate of a city that has doors and a bolt. <italic>To the door or the door-post</italic> means that what Scripture deals with in this verse is to be performed before those who sit in the gate.</p>
<p>AND HE SHALL SERVE HIM FOR EVER. We know that the word <italic>le-olam</italic> (for ever) in Hebrew refers to time, as in <italic>it hath been already, in the ages</italic> (le-olamim) <italic>which were before us</italic> (Eccles. 1:10), wherein <italic>olamim</italic> means ages.<sup><xref rid="fn3902">108</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>ve-yashav sham ad olam</italic> (and there abide for ever) (I Sam. 1:22) means: and he will there abide until he grows up. <italic>Va-avado le-olam</italic> (and he shall serve him for ever) likewise means: and he will serve him until the year of jubilee,<sup><xref rid="fn3903">109</xref></sup> for there is no season of Israel that is longer than it.<sup><xref rid="fn3904">110</xref></sup> Going free is comparable to a renewal of the world.<sup><xref rid="fn3905">111</xref></sup> It is also possible that its meaning is that he should be as he was in former times.<sup><xref rid="fn3906">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND IF A MAN SELL HIS DAUGHTER TO BE A MAID-SERVANT. Scripture speaks of a minor who is under her father&#x2019;s control, like the daughter whose oaths a father may annul.<sup><xref rid="fn3907">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>The phrase <italic>unto a foreign people</italic> (v. 8) is connected to this verse.<sup><xref rid="fn3908">114</xref></sup> For <italic>unto a foreign people</italic> speaks of the father.<sup><xref rid="fn3909">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. TO SELL HER UNTO A FOREIGN PEOPLE HE SHALL HAVE NO POWER, SEEING THAT HE HATH DEALT DECEITFULLY WITH HER. <italic>Bi-vigdo</italic> (that he hath dealt deceitfully) is similar to the word <italic>nivgad</italic> (we deal treacherously) in <italic>Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother</italic> (Mal. 2:10). It is true and correct that the master has no right to sell her to an Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn3910">116</xref></sup> We know this from tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn3911">117</xref></sup> The sages used this verse as a peg and as a support.<sup><xref rid="fn3912">118</xref></sup> Do not be surprised at the distance between <italic>unto a foreign people</italic> and the verse to which it is connected,<sup><xref rid="fn3913">119</xref></sup> for as I will explain, it is the same case with <italic>he shall make restitution</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3914">120</xref></sup> (Ex. 22:2).</p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>unto a foreign people</italic> means to a stranger. The same is true of <italic>wilt Thou slay even a righteous nation</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3915">121</xref></sup> (Gen. 20:4). However, it is impossible that Scripture would refer to an individual by one of these terms. It is correct for Scripture to say, &#x201C;and Israel said,&#x201D; because Israel is a collective noun, like Egypt in <italic>and Egypt said</italic> (Ex. 14:25).<sup><xref rid="fn3916">122</xref></sup> However, it is impossible for a noun which refers to a group, such as the terms people, nation, company, and congregation, to be used for an individual. The meaning of <italic>wilt Thou slay even a righteous nation</italic> is explained by <italic>that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin</italic> (Gen. 20:9).</p>
<p>[SHE SHALL NOT GO OUT AS MEN-SERVANTS DO.] Its meaning is, she shall not go out as men-servants who always go out after six years. The maid-servant also goes out after six years of servitude, as Scripture states, <italic>If thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew women, be sold unto thee, he shall serve thee six years</italic> (Deut. 15:12). However, the maid-servant goes out if she reaches the onset of puberty before six years pass.</p>
<p>IF SHE PLEASE NOT HER MASTER. If she does not find favor in the eyes of her master after he bought her in order to take her for a wife. This is the meaning of <italic>who hath espoused her to himself</italic>; he espoused her to be his wife<sup><xref rid="fn3917">123</xref></sup> or he espoused her to be the wife of his son.<sup><xref rid="fn3918">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that the word <italic>lo</italic> (himself) is spelled<sup><xref rid="fn3919">125</xref></sup> <italic>lamed alef</italic> in the text<sup><xref rid="fn3920">126</xref></sup> and is read<sup><xref rid="fn3921">127</xref></sup> as if written with a <italic>vav</italic> and so spelled in the margin.<sup><xref rid="fn3922">128</xref></sup> The Gaon says that the word <italic>lo</italic> has two meanings.<sup><xref rid="fn3923">129</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>It is He that hath made us, and we are His</italic> (lo) (Ps. 100:3).<sup><xref rid="fn3924">130</xref></sup> One meaning is, we have not made ourselves.<sup><xref rid="fn3925">131</xref></sup> The second meaning is, we are His.<sup><xref rid="fn3926">132</xref></sup> However, in my opinion only the second is the correct meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn3927">133</xref></sup> The same applies to all of them.<sup><xref rid="fn3928">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Judah the grammarian says that we cannot distinguish in pronunciation between <italic>lo</italic> spelled with an <italic>alef</italic> and <italic>lo</italic> spelled with a <italic>vav</italic> or a <italic>heh</italic>, as in <italic>is it not</italic> (ha-loh)<sup><xref rid="fn3929">135</xref></sup> <italic>in Rabbah of the children of Ammon</italic> (Deut. 3:11). All cases where the text has an <italic>alef</italic> and the margin a <italic>vav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3930">136</xref></sup> are to be interpreted the way they are read.<sup><xref rid="fn3931">137</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that the word <italic>ve-hefdah</italic> (then shall he let her to be redeemed) is a transitive verb. It is similar to <italic>ve-happodekha</italic> (and redeemed thee) (Deut. 13:6); <italic>padah</italic> (redeemed) in <italic>who hath redeemed my soul</italic> (II Sam. 4:9); <italic>peditem</italic> (redeemed them) in <italic>For I have redeemed them</italic> (Zech. 10:8).<sup><xref rid="fn3932">138</xref></sup> Now <italic>vehefdah</italic> is a <italic>hifil</italic>. It is like <italic>ha-matzmi&#x2019;ach</italic> (maketh to spring) in <italic>Who maketh the mountains to spring with grass</italic> (Ps. 147:8)<sup><xref rid="fn3933">139</xref></sup> or like the word <italic>he&#x2019;ekhil</italic> (fed)<sup><xref rid="fn3934">140</xref></sup> in saying Reuben fed (<italic>he&#x2019;ekhil</italic>) Simeon bread. The meaning of <italic>ve-hefdah</italic> thus is,<sup><xref rid="fn3935">141</xref></sup> he shall seek her redemption and accept it whether she redeems herself, or her father or one of her relatives redeems her. If she is close to the end of her years of servitude, they shall compute how many years she has served and how many remain till the seventh year or to the time that she reaches the onset of puberty. The redemption money will be in accordance with the aforementioned computation.<sup><xref rid="fn3936">142</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNTO A FOREIGN PEOPLE. I have already explained it.<sup><xref rid="fn3937">143</xref></sup> Note that the term <italic>nokhri</italic> (foreign) applies to all people who are not Israelites. The word <italic>nokhri</italic> does not have the same meaning as the word <italic>zar</italic> (stranger), as the term <italic>zar</italic> refers to one who is not of the same tribal family.<sup><xref rid="fn3938">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now if we say that the Israelites are called Hebrews because<sup><xref rid="fn3939">145</xref></sup> of Eber, who worshipped God, then whoever is descended from Eber and follows Eber&#x2019;s faith is called a Hebrew.<sup><xref rid="fn3940">146</xref></sup> However, if we say that one is called a Hebrew because of Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn3941">147</xref></sup> then Scripture states, <italic>for in Isaac shall seed be called to thee</italic> (Gen. 21:12).<sup><xref rid="fn3942">148</xref></sup> Now even though Scripture writes with regard to Ishmael, <italic>because he is thy seed</italic> (Gen. 21:13),<sup><xref rid="fn3943">149</xref></sup> the land<sup><xref rid="fn3944">150</xref></sup> was given only to Isaac.<sup><xref rid="fn3945">151</xref></sup> Jacob and Esau were sons of Isaac. However, Scripture states with regard to Isaac, <italic>for unto thee, and thy seed, I will give all these lands</italic> (Gen. 26:3). Now Isaac&#x2019;s seed was &#x201C;called&#x201D; only in Jacob, to whom the land was given. Thus the children of the concubines<sup><xref rid="fn3946">152</xref></sup> along with the children of Esau are considered foreigners.</p>
<p>9. AND IF HE ESPOUSE HER UNTO HIS SON. <italic>Yi&#x2019;adennah</italic> (espouse her)<sup><xref rid="fn3947">153</xref></sup> follows the paradigm of <italic>yirashennah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3948">154</xref></sup> The word <italic>mo&#x2019;ed</italic> (season)<sup><xref rid="fn3949">155</xref></sup> is similar to<sup><xref rid="fn3950">156</xref></sup> the word <italic>moked</italic> (altar).<sup><xref rid="fn3951">157</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AFTER THE MANNER OF THE DAUGHTERS.] The reference is to virgin daughters who were not sold.</p>
<p>HE SHALL DEAL WITH HER. The son, and also the father if he took her.</p>
<p>10. IF HE TAKE HIM ANOTHER WIFE. Be she a daughter of Israel who was sold, or be she a daughter of Israel that was not sold.</p>
<p>HER FOOD. <italic>She&#x2019;erah</italic> refers to her food. He must sustain her flesh, which is what <italic>she&#x2019;erah</italic> means.</p>
<p>AND HER CONJUGAL RIGHTS. Some say that <italic>ve-onatah</italic> (and her conjugal rights) means: and the place of her dwelling.<sup><xref rid="fn3952">158</xref></sup> According to them, the word <italic>ve-anah</italic> (shall howl) in <italic>and jackals shall howl</italic> (Is. 13:22) and <italic>ve-anetah</italic> (and she shall respond) in <italic>and she shall respond there</italic> (Hos. 2:17) have a similar meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn3953">159</xref></sup> However, I believe that <italic>ve-anah iyyim</italic> (and jackals shall howl) is to be taken as it implies.<sup><xref rid="fn3954">160</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-anah</italic> is similar to <italic>ve-anita</italic> (and thou shalt speak) in <italic>and thou shalt speak and say</italic> (Deut. 26:5). <italic>Ve-anah</italic> is used metaphorically, for Scripture there metaphorically states, <italic>and the satyr shall cry to his fellow</italic> (Is. 34:14).<sup><xref rid="fn3955">161</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>ve-anetah</italic> in <italic>and she shall there respond</italic> means she shall make music. <italic>Ve-anetah</italic> is similar to <italic>enu</italic> (sing) in <italic>Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving</italic> (Ps. 147:7).</p>
<p><italic>Onatah</italic> refers to sexual activity, also known as the time of lovemaking.<sup><xref rid="fn3956">162</xref></sup> The word <italic>et</italic> (time) is missing a <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3957">163</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>emet</italic> (truth).<sup><xref rid="fn3958">164</xref></sup> Hence the <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>ittekh</italic> (thy time) in <italic>and, behold, thy time</italic> (Ezek. 16:8) receives a <italic>dagesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3959">165</xref></sup> Likewise,<sup><xref rid="fn3960">166</xref></sup> <italic>itto</italic> (his time) is similar to <italic>amitto</italic> (his truth). The word <italic>attah</italic> (now) is also similar.<sup><xref rid="fn3961">167</xref></sup> Note, <italic>onatah</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>et</italic>. The word <italic>attah</italic> (now) means this time.<sup><xref rid="fn3962">168</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND IF. Scripture employed an abridged form in saying <italic>shelosh eleh</italic> (these three). It is similar to <italic>shelosh se&#x2019;im</italic> (three measures) (Gen. 18:6),<sup><xref rid="fn3963">169</xref></sup> for Scripture should have read, <italic>ha-shelosh ha-eleh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3964">170</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many think that <italic>these three</italic> refers to her food, her raiment, and her conjugal rights. However, this is impossible. After Scripture stated, <italic>he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters</italic> (v. 9), and one is obligated to give these three things to all daughters there is no need to mention this here. Furthermore, Scripture writes concerning the beautiful woman<sup><xref rid="fn3965">171</xref></sup> who is a foreigner, <italic>but thou shalt not sell her at all for money</italic> (Deut. 21:14). How much more so is this maid-servant not to be sold for money.<sup><xref rid="fn3966">172</xref></sup> Its correct interpretation thus is: and if he does not do one of these three things, namely, if he does not marry her, or espouse her to his son, or redeem her, she shall go out for nothing when she has the onset of puberty.<sup><xref rid="fn3967">173</xref></sup> <italic>If any that is unclean by a dead body touch all of these</italic>, which means one of these, <italic>shall it be unclean</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3968">174</xref></sup> (Hag. 2:13) is similar. There are many other similar instances.<sup><xref rid="fn3969">175</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Gaon asks, what reason was there for Scripture to say, <italic>without money</italic> after stating <italic>for nothing</italic>? He answers: If she took ill in her master&#x2019;s house and he spent money on medicine,<sup><xref rid="fn3970">176</xref></sup> then she did not have to pay him back anything. However, in my opinion there is no need for all of this, for Scripture offers additional explanation, such as <italic>for thou shalt die, and not live</italic> (II Kings 20:1).<sup><xref rid="fn3971">177</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. HE THAT SMITETH A MAN. The reason this follows the laws dealing with the man- and maid-servant is that Scripture wanted to go on and explain how to deal with one who strikes his man- and maid-servants.<sup><xref rid="fn3972">178</xref></sup></p>
<p>[A MAN.] The reference is to an Israelite.</p>
<p>HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH. By a court of law. This is the case whenever the term <italic>mot yumat</italic> (he shall surely be put to death) is employed. The one exception to this will be shown shortly.</p>
<p>13. AND IF A MAN LIE NOT IN WAIT. <italic>Tzadah</italic> (lie in wait) is similar to the word <italic>bi-tzediyyah</italic> (lying in wait) (Num. 35:20) and <italic>tzodeh</italic> (layest wait) in <italic>though thou layest wait for my soul to take it</italic> (I Sam. 24:12). Observe, it involves laying in wait and acting presumptuously.<sup><xref rid="fn3973">179</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT GOD CAUSE IT TO COME TO HAND. <italic>Innah</italic> (cause it to come) is similar to <italic>mitanneh</italic> (seeketh an occasion) in <italic>he seeketh an occasion against me</italic> (II Kings 5:7), the meaning of which is, he looks for reasons and excuses.<sup><xref rid="fn3974">180</xref></sup> The meaning of our clause is that God caused and arranged things so that this person would die at this individual&#x2019;s hand even though he had never intended to kill him. God caused this to happen to him so that he would be exiled from his place because of some other sin which he committed. Scripture explicitly states, <italic>There shall no mischief befall the righteous</italic> (Prov. 12:21).</p>
<p>14. AND IF A MAN COME PRESUMPTUOUSLY. <italic>To slay him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3975">181</xref></sup> is to be understood as if written, and slew him with guile.<sup><xref rid="fn3976">182</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>If she profane by playing the harlot</italic> (Lev. 21:9),<sup><xref rid="fn3977">183</xref></sup> the meaning of which is, if she profane herself by playing the harlot and therefore <italic>she profaneth her father</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).<sup><xref rid="fn3978">184</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is known that the term <italic>chillul</italic> (profanation) and the word <italic>techillah</italic> (beginning) come from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn3979">185</xref></sup> However, they differ in meaning. It was therefore necessary to differentiate between them. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>techel li-zenot</italic> (profane by playing the harlot) (Lev. 21:9), for if it had the meaning of beginning, it would read <italic>tachel</italic> (thou shalt begin), as in <italic>tachel lispor</italic> (shalt thou begin to number) (Num. 16:9).<sup><xref rid="fn3980">186</xref></sup></p>
<p>FROM MINE ALTAR. This is the reverse of the previous verse. It is there stated, <italic>then I will appoint thee a place</italic> [<italic>whither he may flee</italic>], the reference being to the cities of refuge. However, he who presumptuously kills and flees, even if he seeks refuge at the altar as Joab did,<sup><xref rid="fn3981">187</xref></sup> shall be put to death. Our sages said even a priest<sup><xref rid="fn3982">188</xref></sup> who wants to perform the service at the altar shall be put to death.<sup><xref rid="fn3983">189</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND HE THAT SMITETH HIS FATHER. Since Scripture had previously mentioned, <italic>He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death</italic> (v. 12), Scripture had to explain that there is an instance where one is put to death for smiting someone even when the one who is struck does not die. This is the case when one hits one&#x2019;s father.</p>
<p>The word <italic>u-makkeh</italic> (and he that smiteth) is to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn3984">190</xref></sup> It was out of regard for the parents&#x2019; honor that Scripture found it necessary to state<sup><xref rid="fn3985">191</xref></sup> that even when one does not strike one&#x2019;s parents but curses them, he is to be put to death.</p>
<p>16. AND HE THAT STEALETH A MAN. Saadiah Gaon asks: Why was this verse inserted between <italic>He that smiteth his father</italic> (v. 15) and <italic>And he that curseth his father</italic> (v. 17)? He answers that Scripture speaks only of the commonplace. Those stolen were young children. They were brought up in a strange country and did not recognize their parents. It is thus possible for them to strike and curse their parents. The punishment for this will fall upon the kidnapper.</p>
<p>OR IF HE BE FOUND IN HIS HAND. In the market before he sells him,<sup><xref rid="fn3986">192</xref></sup> then he shall be put to death.</p>
<p>17. AND HE THAT CURSETH. We find a curse that invokes the name of God, as in <italic>and cursed them in the name of the Lord</italic> (II Kings 2:24). We also find curses that do not invoke the name of God.</p>
<p>18. AND IF MEN CONTEND. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>be-egrof</italic> (with his fist) is similar to <italic>egrofin</italic> (strong) in &#x201C;strong men.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3987">193</xref></sup> The reference<sup><xref rid="fn3988">194</xref></sup> is to something strong and hard. Rabbi Merinus says that the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>egrof</italic> is superfluous. It is like the <italic>alef</italic> of <italic>ezro&#x2019;i</italic> (my shoulder) (Job 31:22).<sup><xref rid="fn3989">195</xref></sup> It comes from the same root as <italic>ge-rafam</italic> (swept them away) (Jud. 5:21).<sup><xref rid="fn3990">196</xref></sup> The reference is to something that one drags in one&#x2019;s hand.<sup><xref rid="fn3991">197</xref></sup> The same is true in Arabic.</p>
<p>19. IF HE RISE AGAIN. We will rely on our sages of blessed memory who said that <italic>al mishanto</italic> (upon his staff) means that he supports himself and does not lean on others as sick people do.<sup><xref rid="fn3992">198</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEN SHALL HE THAT SMOTE HIM BE QUIT. They shall release him from prison.</p>
<p>[LOSS OF HIS TIME.] <italic>Shivto</italic> (loss of his time) comes from the same root as <italic>shevitah</italic> (rest),<sup><xref rid="fn3993">199</xref></sup> for his work stopped.<sup><xref rid="fn3994">200</xref></sup> This interpretation is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn3995">201</xref></sup> <italic>Shivto</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>shivro</italic> (his corn money) (Gen. 44:2), for the <italic>tav</italic> is a root letter. It is possible that <italic>shivto</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>shivtah</italic> (tarried) in <italic>save that she tarried a little in the house</italic> (Ruth 2:7). <italic>Shivtah</italic> comes from the same root as the word <italic>yashav</italic> (sat).<sup><xref rid="fn3996">202</xref></sup> <italic>Shivto</italic> refers to the time that the one who was struck sat at home resting, without work. What proves that this interpretation is correct is that it is the reverse of <italic>and walk abroad</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3997">203</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SHALL CAUSE HIM TO BE THOROUGHLY HEALED. This is a sign that permission has been granted to physicians to heal blows and wounds that are visible on the surface.<sup><xref rid="fn3998">204</xref></sup> However, it is in God&#x2019;s hand to heal any illness which strikes inside of the body. It is thus written, <italic>For He maketh sore, and bindeth up</italic> (Job 5:18). Furthermore, Scripture tells us concerning King Asa, <italic>yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians</italic> (II Chron. 16:12).<sup><xref rid="fn3999">205</xref></sup> Now Scripture distinguished between them.<sup><xref rid="fn4000">206</xref></sup> It does not state, <italic>verafo yirpe</italic> (and he shall surely heal), which is in the <italic>kal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4001">207</xref></sup> It rather reads, <italic>ve-rappo yerappe</italic> (and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed). The latter is in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4002">208</xref></sup> I will explain this very well later on in this portion.<sup><xref rid="fn4003">209</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rabbis received a tradition concerning other payments<sup><xref rid="fn4004">210</xref></sup> in addition to the two<sup><xref rid="fn4005">211</xref></sup> mentioned in our verse. They similarly received a tradition to include spices which are not stated in the Torah among the incense spices.<sup><xref rid="fn4006">212</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND IF A MAN SMITE HIS BONDMAN. There is no doubt that according to Israelite jurisprudence the same ordinances that apply to a free man apply to a person sold into bondage. Hence it is impossible for the bondman<sup><xref rid="fn4007">213</xref></sup> to be a Hebrew servant.<sup><xref rid="fn4008">214</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture states at the end,<sup><xref rid="fn4009">215</xref></sup> <italic>for he is his money</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4010">216</xref></sup> Now the bondman and bondwoman<sup><xref rid="fn4011">217</xref></sup> are the ones concerning whom Scripture writes, <italic>of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids</italic> (Lev. 25:44).</p>
<p>The <italic>bet</italic> of <italic>ba-shevet</italic> (with a rod) is vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic>. <sup><xref rid="fn4012">218</xref></sup> The reference is to the rod<sup><xref rid="fn4013">219</xref></sup> which the master was in the habit of using to beat his servants.</p>
<p>Now all those who dispute the words of our sages<sup><xref rid="fn4014">220</xref></sup> are forced to agree with them with regard to the phrase <italic>nakom yinnakem</italic> (he shall surely be avenged),<sup><xref rid="fn4015">221</xref></sup> for vengeance takes many forms.<sup><xref rid="fn4016">222</xref></sup> Now logic will not help them in this case.<sup><xref rid="fn4017">223</xref></sup> The fathers have received the tradition that <italic>nakem yenakem</italic> (he shall surely be avenged) is similar to <italic>a sword that shall avenge</italic> (nokemet) <italic>the vengeance of the covenant</italic> (nekam berit) (Lev. 26:25).<sup><xref rid="fn4018">224</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. NOTWITHSTANDING. Observe that the word <italic>yukkam</italic> (be punished),<sup><xref rid="fn4019">225</xref></sup> which is a <italic>hofal</italic>, has the same meaning as <italic>yinnakem</italic> (be punished),<sup><xref rid="fn4020">226</xref></sup> which is a <italic>nifal</italic>.</p>
<p>The heretics<sup><xref rid="fn4021">227</xref></sup> say that the meaning of <italic>nakom yinnakem</italic> (he shall surely be avenged) is that great vengeance shall be exacted, namely, that the master shall be beaten. However, if the bondman lives for a day, less vengeance shall be exacted. If he lives for two days no vengeance shall be taken. They argue<sup><xref rid="fn4022">228</xref></sup> that we do not find the term vengeance used with reference to the death penalty inflicted by a law court. They also say, that there is no positive proof that <italic>a sword that shall avenge</italic> (Lev. 26:25) refers to being put to death.<sup><xref rid="fn4023">229</xref></sup> Furthermore, what need is there to say &#x201C;two days&#x201D; after saying &#x201C;a day&#x201D;?<sup><xref rid="fn4024">230</xref></sup> However, their<sup><xref rid="fn4025">231</xref></sup> real difficulty lies in accepting the idea that the master would be executed because of the death of a bondman. I will now answer them.</p>
<p>Why didn&#x2019;t Scripture specify what greater or lesser vengeance is to be exacted?<sup><xref rid="fn4026">232</xref></sup> Let us now pursue what is written in Scripture. Scripture states, <italic>nekom nikmat bene yisrael</italic> (avenge the children of Israel) (Num. 31:2). It then goes on to tell us that all the Midianites were killed. Note that Samson said, <italic>ki im nikkamti ba-khem</italic> (surely I will be avenged of you) (Jud. 15:7). It then states, <italic>And he smote them hip [and thigh with a great slaughter</italic>] (Jud. 15:8). Samson said, <italic>ve-innakemah nekam achat</italic> (that I may be this once avenged) (Jud. 16:28) and they died in the house.<sup><xref rid="fn4027">233</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>And a two-edged sword in their hand</italic> (Ps. 149:6). It then goes on to say, <italic>To execute vengeance</italic> (nikamah) <italic>upon the nations</italic> (Ps. 149:7).</p>
<p>The Bible states, <italic>For he doth avenge</italic> (yikkom) <italic>the blood of his servants</italic> (Deut. 32:43). Now blood indicates slaughter.<sup><xref rid="fn4028">234</xref></sup> This is the way the term<sup><xref rid="fn4029">235</xref></sup> is always used. The reason Scripture here refers to execution by vengeance is that a master seeks excuses to fall upon his bondman because he is in his power,<sup><xref rid="fn4030">236</xref></sup> as he cannot smite a fellow Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn4031">237</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now let us turn to Scripture&#x2019;s statement a <italic>day or two</italic>. Observe that the latter is like <italic>At the mouth of two witnesses</italic> [<italic>or three witnesses</italic>] (Deut. 17:6).<sup><xref rid="fn4032">238</xref></sup> They<sup><xref rid="fn4033">239</xref></sup> said that they do not know its meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn4034">240</xref></sup> Let them put our verse along with it.<sup><xref rid="fn4035">241</xref></sup> Our sages of blessed memory said that the meaning of <italic>a day or two</italic> is that the hours shall add up to the twenty-four of a day.<sup><xref rid="fn4036">242</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now when we examined the verse we found that Scripture says, &#x201C;with the rod,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn4037">243</xref></sup> the reference being to the disciplining rod, as in <italic>Thou beatest him with the rod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4038">244</xref></sup> (Prov. 23:14). It is thus clear that the master wanted to punish the bondman. Scripture did not mention what the laws are regarding a master who kills his bondman,<sup><xref rid="fn4039">245</xref></sup> because a master normally takes pity on the bondman, whom he owns, and refrains from killing him even as he takes pity upon his cattle. Now God commanded that a master shall not act sadistically when he punishes his bondman. When he sees the bondman dying under his rod the master shall let him be. If he does not leave the bondman alone then he will be put to death on the bondman&#x2019;s account, for God&#x2019;s mercy is upon all of His creatures. Indeed, concerning David we read, <italic>Thou hast shed blood abundantly</italic> (I Chron. 22:8).<sup><xref rid="fn4040">246</xref></sup> The reference was to non-Israelite blood.<sup><xref rid="fn4041">247</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND IF MEN STRIVE<sup><xref rid="fn4042">248</xref></sup> TOGETHER. The reference is to Hebrew men<sup><xref rid="fn4043">249</xref></sup> who strive together and hit each other. Scripture similarly reads, <italic>Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow</italic>? (Ex. 2:13)<sup><xref rid="fn4044">250</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HURT. Both are included.<sup><xref rid="fn4045">251</xref></sup> Sometimes its meaning is one or the other.<sup><xref rid="fn4046">252</xref></sup> Thus the meaning of <italic>they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they</italic> (Lev. 20:14) is, either this one or that one.<sup><xref rid="fn4047">253</xref></sup> If both<sup><xref rid="fn4048">254</xref></sup> are Israelites one law applies to them. The woman spoken of in this verse is an Israelite woman.</p>
<p>YET NO HARM FOLLOW. To the woman.</p>
<p>HE SHALL BE SURELY FINED. Because of the children who were aborted and died.</p>
<p>ACCORDING AS THE WOMAN&#x2019;S HUSBAND SHALL LAY UPON HIM. If the one who hurt the woman wants to do according to the will of the father of the children.<sup><xref rid="fn4049">255</xref></sup> Otherwise he shall pay in accordance to the ruling of the law court. <italic>Bi-fililim</italic> (as the judges determine) is similar to the word <italic>u-fillelo</italic> (shall judge him).<sup><xref rid="fn4050">256</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. BUT IF ANY HARM FOLLOW. To the woman. We find a difference of opinion.<sup><xref rid="fn4051">257</xref></sup> Some say that the one who caused the women&#x2019;s death is put to death because he intended to kill a fellow Israelite. They offer as proof the fact that Scripture states, <italic>he shall surely be fined</italic> (v. 22) with regard to the children, but it states with regard to the woman, <italic>then thou shalt give life for life</italic>. Now if the reference is to a fine,<sup><xref rid="fn4052">258</xref></sup> then in what way is the woman&#x2019;s death worse than that of the children? On the other hand, if we say that one is to be punished with death for killing the children, why did Scripture alter its style<sup><xref rid="fn4053">259</xref></sup> and read, <italic>life for life</italic>?</p>
<p>The opposing opinion maintains that one who intends to kill one individual and kills another is not put to death, and the reason the Torah altered its language and stated <italic>life for life</italic> is that the fine for killing a person is much greater than that for killing an embryo. They offer as proof the fact that the Torah afterwards reads, <italic>eye for eye, tooth for tooth</italic> (v. 24). The latter is not to be taken literally. On the contrary, it refers to ransom.<sup><xref rid="fn4054">260</xref></sup></p>
<p>This portion<sup><xref rid="fn4055">261</xref></sup> was written because of the clause <italic>eye for eye, tooth for tooth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4056">262</xref></sup> Scripture afterwards codifies the law dealing with the eye and tooth of a bondman.<sup><xref rid="fn4057">263</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. EYE. Rabbi Saadiah says that we cannot interpret this verse according to its plain meaning. For if a man struck his neighbor&#x2019;s eye and the eye lost a third of its sight, how is it possible to punish the culprit with an equivalent blow, that is, with a blow which is neither greater nor lesser?<sup><xref rid="fn4058">264</xref></sup> There is a possibility that the culprit will lose his entire eyesight. Burns, wounds, and stripes present even greater difficulties, for if they were inflicted on a dangerous area it is possible for the culprit to die. The mind cannot accept this.<sup><xref rid="fn4059">265</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ben Zuta<sup><xref rid="fn4060">266</xref></sup> said to Saadiah Gaon: Does not Scripture elsewhere state, <italic>as he hath maimed a man, so shall it be rendered unto him</italic> (Lev. 24:20)? Rabbi Saadiah answered him: We have a <italic>bet</italic> taking the place of the word <italic>al</italic> (on).<sup><xref rid="fn4061">267</xref></sup> Its meaning is, so shall a fine be placed upon him.<sup><xref rid="fn4062">268</xref></sup> However, Ben Zuta responded, <italic>as he hath done, so shall it be done to him</italic> (Lev. 24:19).<sup><xref rid="fn4063">269</xref></sup> The Gaon retorted: Observe, Samson said, <italic>As they did unto me, so have I done unto them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4064">270</xref></sup> (Jud. 15:11). Now Samson did not take their wives and hand them over to others.<sup><xref rid="fn4065">271</xref></sup> He only repaid them for their dastardly acts. Ben Zuta responded: If the culprit<sup><xref rid="fn4066">272</xref></sup> is a poor man what shall his punishment be? The Gaon answered: If a blind person shall blind one who can see, what shall be done to him, for it is possible for a poor person to become wealthy and pay. However, it is eternally impossible for the blind to pay.<sup><xref rid="fn4067">273</xref></sup></p>
<p>The general rule is that we cannot fully explain any commandment written in the Torah unless we rely on the words of our sages of blessed memory. Just as we received the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn4068">274</xref></sup> from the sages,<sup><xref rid="fn4069">275</xref></sup> so did we receive the Oral Law.<sup><xref rid="fn4070">276</xref></sup> There is no difference between them. Now the interpretation of <italic>eye for eye</italic> is, it is fitting for the culprit to give his eye in place of his victim&#x2019;s eye if he does not pay ransom for it.<sup><xref rid="fn4071">277</xref></sup></p>
<p>[TOOTH FOR TOOTH, HAND FOR HAND, FOOT FOR FOOT.] Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says: In some cases the payment for taking out a tooth is very small.<sup><xref rid="fn4072">278</xref></sup> This is the case when a youth is struck, because if his tooth is uprooted another will take its place.<sup><xref rid="fn4073">279</xref></sup> Scripture mentions the hand because one does work with it.<sup><xref rid="fn4074">280</xref></sup> Scripture mentions the foot because the loss of a foot is worse than the loss of a hand, as a person cannot walk on one foot.<sup><xref rid="fn4075">281</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, I believe that Scripture mentions these organs because they are the ones that are usually harmed. When a man strikes his neighbor he strikes him in the eye which faces him, or the mouth which faces him and thus breaks his teeth, or in the hand that his neighbor fights with or protects his face with, or his foot when he runs away from him.</p>
<p>25. BURN. <italic>Keviyyah</italic> (bum) is to be taken at face value; that is, it refers to a burn caused by fire.</p>
<p>Some say that <italic>petza</italic> (wound) refers to a bleeding wound and <italic>chabburah</italic> (stripe) to a blow that does not draw blood. However, the Gaon says that <italic>petza</italic> refers to breaking a bone and <italic>chabburah</italic> to a bleeding wound.</p>
<p>26. AND IF A MAN SMITE. God commanded that a bondman should go free because of his eye or tooth to prevent masters from cruelly striking their servants with terrible blows. Thus if the master destroys his bondman&#x2019;s eye or even his tooth, then the bondman will pass from his control free of charge and the master will forfeit his property.</p>
<p>27. AND IF HE SMITE OUT HIS BONDMAN&#x2019;S TOOTH. Scripture, as I have noted, speaks about the most usual. According to tradition a bondman similarly goes free if any of his major organs<sup><xref rid="fn4076">282</xref></sup> are destroyed.</p>
<p>28. AND IF AN OX GORE A MAN. This portion<sup><xref rid="fn4077">283</xref></sup> is mentioned because of <italic>if the ox gore a bondman or a bondwoman</italic> (v. 32).<sup><xref rid="fn4078">284</xref></sup> The man and the woman referred to in our verse are Israelites. Our verse reads, <italic>or a woman</italic>. Scripture does not mention a woman in <italic>He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth</italic> (v. 12) because it is the manner of Scripture to mention the more important, namely, the male. Nevertheless, the same law applies to a female.<sup><xref rid="fn4079">285</xref></sup> Scripture now mentions a woman<sup><xref rid="fn4080">286</xref></sup> so that the owner of the ox does not protest and argue that the woman did not follow the normal practice. For there are places where it is not the custom for women to go out of the city to a field where oxen are found. It is because of this that Scripture afterwards states, <italic>Whether it have gored a son, or gored a daughter</italic> (v. 31). The law concerning one that smiteth a man applies equally whether the victim is an adult or a minor. Scripture mentions son or a daughter so that the owner of the ox does not protest against the parents and say that the parents should have watched their children.</p>
<p>THE OX SHALL BE SURELY STONED. The meaning of <italic>and its flesh shall not be eaten</italic> is that its flesh shall not be eaten as the flesh of an animal that dies of itself, which the stranger in the gate or the foreigner may eat.<sup><xref rid="fn4081">287</xref></sup> Our sages said that every time Scripture states, <italic>it shall not he eaten</italic>, it means that it is prohibited to derive any pleasure from it.</p>
<p>BUT THE OWNER OF THE OX SHALL BE QUIT. Of punishment.</p>
<p>29. BUT IF THE OX WAS WONT TO GORE. There is no doubt that there is no ransom for those who are to be executed by a court of law.<sup><xref rid="fn4082">288</xref></sup> The transmitters of tradition therefore said that <italic>shall also be put to death</italic> refers to death at the hands of heaven. Now I believe that here [the term <italic>shall be put to death</italic>] is similar to <italic>eye for eye</italic>. Its meaning is, the owner shall be put to death if he does not give a redemption for his life. All of this because Scripture reads, <italic>yumat</italic> (shall be put to death); not <italic>yamut</italic> (he will die).<sup><xref rid="fn4083">289</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. IF THERE BE LAID ON HIM A RANSOM. This does not contradict <italic>Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer</italic> (Num. 35:31), for Scripture speaks there of a real murderer. However, the person spoken of in our verse did not commit murder. He is only punished because he did not restrain the ox by tying it up. Or, if he tied the ox up, he did not do so properly so that the ox was able to free itself. Or, the ox did not find the door<sup><xref rid="fn4084">290</xref></sup> closed<sup><xref rid="fn4085">291</xref></sup> and it went out and caused damage.</p>
<p>LAID UPON HIM. By the decree of the judges.</p>
<p>31. WHETHER IT HAVE GORED A SON, OR HAVE GORED A DAUGHTER. Both of whom are Israelites, for Scripture afterwards reads, <italic>If the ox gore a bondman</italic> (v. 32). God decreed that the owner of the ox<sup><xref rid="fn4086">292</xref></sup> be punished because it is hard for God to see an animal kill a person who is created in the image of God. Because of this, the ox is also stoned.</p>
<p>33. AND IF A MAN SHALL OPEN A PIT. Which was dug.<sup><xref rid="fn4087">293</xref></sup> Scripture mentions this because God does not want an animal to die in vain, that is, if its death does not serve human needs. Furthermore, he<sup><xref rid="fn4088">294</xref></sup> injures the owner of the beast.</p>
<p>34. THE OWNER OF THE PIT. The one who opened it or the one who dug it. This is the law even though the pit is on public property.<sup><xref rid="fn4089">295</xref></sup> He made it for his use; therefore he is called the owner of the pit.</p>
<p>HE SHALL GIVE MONEY. He shall pay what the fallen animal was worth when alive after deducting the value of the carcass.</p>
<p>35. AND IF ONE MAN&#x2019;S OX HURT ANOTHER&#x2019;S. Ben Zuta says that <italic>re&#x2019;ehu</italic> (another&#x2019;s)<sup><xref rid="fn4090">296</xref></sup> is an adjective describing the ox.<sup><xref rid="fn4091">297</xref></sup> However, Ben Zuta did not notice that the word <italic>shor</italic> (ox) is in the construct with <italic>ish</italic> (man&#x2019;s).<sup><xref rid="fn4092">298</xref></sup> This is also the case with the word <italic>shor</italic> (ox) and <italic>re&#x2019;ehu</italic> (another&#x2019;s).<sup><xref rid="fn4093">299</xref></sup> However, an ox has no neighbor except for Ben Zuta.<sup><xref rid="fn4094">300</xref></sup> The owner of a tame ox pays half of the damage.</p>
<p>36. OR IF IT BE KNOWN. On the other hand, if the ox was a gorer he shall pay the entire damage. Scripture mentions the laws dealing with the ox up to <italic>If a man steal an ox</italic> (v. 37).<sup><xref rid="fn4095">301</xref></sup> All of this<sup><xref rid="fn4096">302</xref></sup> because of the bondman who is sold<sup><xref rid="fn4097">303</xref></sup> because of his theft. This is the way our Torah portion opened, namely, <italic>If thou buy a Hebrew servant</italic> (v. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn4098">304</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. IF A MAN STEAL. Rabbi Joshua says that God was stricter with an ox than with a sheep because the thief cannot hide an ox as he can a sheep.<sup><xref rid="fn4099">305</xref></sup> One cannot steal it unless one is experienced in the art of theft.<sup><xref rid="fn4100">306</xref></sup> However, Saadiah Gaon says that the theft of an ox is more severely punished because the owner of the ox suffers more than that of a sheep because the ox is used for plowing.</p>

<ftnote id="fn3814"><sup>20</sup> Someone descended from Abraham, such as an Ishmaelite, Edomite or the like. Abraham was known as Abraham the Hebrew (Gen. 14:13). Hence his descendants, whether Israelites or not, are called Hebrews according to this interpretation.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3822"><sup>28</sup> The verse continues, <italic>he shall serve thee six years; and in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee</italic>. Thus Deut. 15:12 and our verse refer to the same type of servant. Now if the term Hebrew does not refer to an Israelite, why does Scripture use the term brother? Brother refers only to an Israelite. If Deut. 15:12 referred to a non-Israelite it should have read, &#x201C;If a Hebrew man be sold unto thee.&#x201D; We thus see that our verse refers to an Israelite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3823"><sup>29</sup> It is clear that brother refers to an Israelite, for <italic>brother</italic> stands in contrast to <italic>stranger</italic>.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 22</title>
<p>1. IF A THIEF BE FOUND BREAKING IN. At night, as the thief would not break in during the day. <italic>If the sun he risen upon him</italic> in the verse which follows proves this.</p>
<p>[THERE SHALL BE NO BLOODGUILTINESS FOR HIM.] That is, the one who kills the thief is not guilty of bloodshed.<sup><xref rid="fn4101">1</xref></sup> One has to be amazed at those who interpret <italic>damim</italic> (bloodguiltiness) as life.<sup><xref rid="fn4102">2</xref></sup> If this is so, what is the meaning of <italic>because thou art a man of blood</italic> (damim) (II Sam. 16:8) and <italic>his blood</italic> (damav) <italic>shall be upon him</italic> (Lev. 20:9).</p>
<p>2. IF THE SUN BE RISEN UPON HIM&#x2026;HE SHALL MAKE RESTITUTION. This<sup><xref rid="fn4103">3</xref></sup> refers to <italic>he shall pay five oxen for an ox</italic>, etc. (Ex. 21:37), which is written above.<sup><xref rid="fn4104">4</xref></sup> It is like <italic>unto a foreign people</italic> (Ex. 21:8)<sup><xref rid="fn4105">5</xref></sup> and <italic>And also unto thy bondwoman thou shalt do likewise</italic> (Deut. 15:17), which refers to <italic>thou shalt furnish him liberally</italic> (Deut. 15:14), which is written above it.</p>
<p>HE SHALL BE SOLD FOR HIS THEFT. Because of his theft.<sup><xref rid="fn4106">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. IF THE THEFT BE FOUND IN HIS HAND. This verse refers to all beasts.<sup><xref rid="fn4107">7</xref></sup> Our sages<sup><xref rid="fn4108">8</xref></sup> received a tradition that Scripture decrees<sup><xref rid="fn4109">9</xref></sup> that the law concerning the payment of &#x201C;four and five&#x201D; applies only to oxen and sheep.<sup><xref rid="fn4110">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. IF A MAN CAUSE A FIELD OR A VINEYARD TO BE EATEN. This too is connected to what is written above<sup><xref rid="fn4111">11</xref></sup> wherein the damage cause by an ox is mentioned. Scripture reads, <italic>ki yaver</italic> (if&#x2026;cause&#x2026;to be eaten). The word <italic>yaver</italic> (cause to be eaten) comes from the same root as <italic>be&#x2019;irenu</italic> (our cattle) in <italic>we and our cattle</italic> (Num. 22:4).<sup><xref rid="fn4112">12</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn4113">13</xref></sup> is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4114">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND IT FEED IN ANOTHER MAN&#x2019;S FIELD.] <italic>Bi-sedeh acker</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4115">15</xref></sup> means in another man&#x2019;s field.<sup><xref rid="fn4116">16</xref></sup> <italic>Ye that have eaten up the vineyard</italic> (Is. 3:4)<sup><xref rid="fn4117">17</xref></sup> is similar.</p>
<p>5. IF FIRE BREAK OUT. This too is connected to what is written above, for it speaks of damage caused to a field.</p>
<p>[HE THAT KINDLED.] The word <italic>ha-mavir</italic> (he that kindled) does not have the same meaning as the word <italic>yaver</italic> (cause to be eaten) in <italic>if a man cause&#x2026;to be eaten</italic> (v. 4) even though they both come from the same conjugation.<sup><xref rid="fn4118">18</xref></sup> For the word fire indicates what <italic>ha-mavir</italic> means.<sup><xref rid="fn4119">19</xref></sup> It is considered beautiful Hebrew style to employ the same word with two meanings,<sup><xref rid="fn4120">20</xref></sup> as in <italic>With the jawbone of an ass</italic> (ha-chamor), <italic>heaps upon heaps</italic> (chamor chamorotayim) (Jud. 15:16), and in <italic>that rode on thirty ass colts</italic> (ayarim), <italic>and they had thirty cities</italic> (u-sheloshim ayarim lahem) (Jud. 10:4). Now in the latter verse the second <italic>ayarim</italic> means cities, as <italic>which are called Havvoth-jair</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>) proves.<sup><xref rid="fn4121">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. IF A MAN DELIVERS. This is also connected to what is written above.<sup><xref rid="fn4122">22</xref></sup> Scripture speaks of theft so as to complete the ordinances concerning theft.<sup><xref rid="fn4123">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. WHETHER HE HAVE NOT PUT HIS HAND UNTO HIS NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S GOODS. This indicates that <italic>then the master of the house shall come near unto God</italic> refers to an oath sworn before judges.<sup><xref rid="fn4124">24</xref></sup> Hence, <italic>For every matter of trespass</italic> (v. 8) follows. This means that the one who swore sinned.<sup><xref rid="fn4125">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua says that <italic>pesha</italic> (trespass) means that it went out of the owner&#x2019;s possession, as in &#x201C;Then did Edom revolt from under the hand of Judah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn4126">26</xref></sup> (II Kings 8:22). <italic>For every matter of trespass</italic> (v. 8) includes everything that follows<sup><xref rid="fn4127">27</xref></sup> and everything<sup><xref rid="fn4128">28</xref></sup> that passes out of the owner&#x2019;s possession,<sup><xref rid="fn4129">29</xref></sup> whether stolen<sup><xref rid="fn4130">30</xref></sup> or lost,<sup><xref rid="fn4131">31</xref></sup> with the finder denying and not admitting that he found it.</p>
<p>8. WHEREOF ONE SAITH. The witness saith, <italic>This is it</italic>.</p>
<p>THIS IS IT&#x2026;HE WHOM GOD SHALL CONDEMN. If God<sup><xref rid="fn4132">32</xref></sup> shall condemn the keeper, because he himself stole it, or one who found an object and denied finding it, and thus became a thief because of it.</p>
<p>9. IF A MAN DELIVER. Our verse speaks of a paid bailee.<sup><xref rid="fn4133">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. UNTO HIS NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S GOODS. <italic>According to the pace of the cattle</italic> (Gen. 33:14.) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn4134">34</xref></sup> The owner takes nothing from the keeper except for the oath.</p>
<p>12. IF IT BE TORN IN PIECES. He was paid for this.<sup><xref rid="fn4135">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>LET HIM BRING IT FOR WITNESS. Let him bring a piece of the carcass as proof. This is in line with <italic>As a shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion, Two legs, or a piece of an ear</italic> (Amos 3:12).</p>
<p>13. AND IF A MAN BORROW AUGHT. According to the plain meaning of the text, <italic>the owner thereof not being with it</italic> means that the owner can claim that the borrower overworked his animal.</p>
<p>14. IF THE OWNER THEREOF BE WITH IT. If the owner himself saw how the animal was hurt or died.<sup><xref rid="fn4136">36</xref></sup> The same law applies to a hired animal accompanied on the way by its lessee and lessor.<sup><xref rid="fn4137">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture concludes its dealing with theft of property and proceeds to discuss theft of confidence namely, seduction, for we often find men seducing young women of immature mind.<sup><xref rid="fn4138">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. THAT IS NOT BETROTHED. For a betrothed woman is considered to be married<sup><xref rid="fn4139">39</xref></sup> even though she has not slept with her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn4140">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>[HE SHALL SURELY PAY A DOWRY FOR HER.] <italic>Mahor yimharennah</italic> (he shall surely pay a dowry for her) is similar to the word <italic>mohar</italic> used in the sense of attachment, as in <italic>acher maharu</italic> (that attach themselves unto another)<sup><xref rid="fn4141">41</xref></sup> (Ps. 16:4). The root <italic>mem, heh, resh</italic> having the meaning of quickly (<italic>meherah</italic>) is only found in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> in all of Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn4142">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. HE SHALL PAY MONEY. For seducing her.</p>
<p>17. A SORCERESS. Scripture mentions the law of the sorceress after the law dealing with a seduced virgin because those who lust desire to satisfy their cravings through magic.<sup><xref rid="fn4143">43</xref></sup> Scripture speaks of a sorceress because women practice sorcery more than men.<sup><xref rid="fn4144">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. WHOSOEVER LIETH WITH A BEAST. Scripture first mentions the laws dealing with the seduction of an immature young woman. It also mentions intercourse with an animal that, unlike a woman, cannot cry for help. It then mentions<sup><xref rid="fn4145">45</xref></sup> the law concerning a woman who can cry for help.<sup><xref rid="fn4146">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. HE THAT SACRIFICETH UNTO THE GODS. According to the plain meaning of the text the verse does not speak of an Israelite, for Scripture already warned against this in the second statement.<sup><xref rid="fn4147">47</xref></sup> It is only mentioned because of the stranger who is mentioned in the next verse. It is because of the stranger<sup><xref rid="fn4148">48</xref></sup> that Scripture reads, <italic>Whosoever lieth with a beast</italic> (v. 18), for this is the manner of the foreign nations. Now a stranger may live in the Land of Israel on the following conditions: that he does not lie with a beast and that he does not sacrifice unto idols. Scripture reads, <italic>la-elohim</italic> (unto the gods) because the reference is to the gods that the stranger was previously accustomed to worship.<sup><xref rid="fn4149">49</xref></sup> The term <italic>la-elohim</italic> (the gods) also takes in the angels.<sup><xref rid="fn4150">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>UNTO THE LORD ONLY. Only unto the glorious name<sup><xref rid="fn4151">51</xref></sup> which is a common noun not used for any other being.<sup><xref rid="fn4152">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND A STRANGER. When a stranger commits himself not to worship idols you shall not wrong him in your country because you are more powerful than he is. Remember that you were strangers like him.</p>
<p>When Scripture makes mention of the stranger who is powerless, it similarly takes note of the orphan and widow who are powerless Israelites. After saying <italic>lo te&#x2019;annun</italic> (ye shall not afflict) (v. 21) which is in the plural, Scripture says <italic>im te&#x2019;anneh</italic> (if thou afflict) (v. 22)<sup><xref rid="fn4153">53</xref></sup> because whoever sees a person afflicting the orphan and the widow and does not aid them, is also considered an afflicter.</p>
<p>22. IF THOU AFFLICT THEM. Note the punishment.<sup><xref rid="fn4154">54</xref></sup> If a person afflicts an orphan or a widow and no one comes to their aid, all are punished. The next verse therefore reads, <italic>My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you</italic>, that is, all of you.</p>
<p>Scripture says, &#x201C;for if he cry at all unto me&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn4155">55</xref></sup> in regard to the orphan. The same applies to a widow. However, it is possible that the orphan is very young and cannot articulate his pain like the widow.<sup><xref rid="fn4156">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. IF THOU LEND MONEY. If the Lord gave you enough wealth so that you are able to lend to the poor.<sup><xref rid="fn4157">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>This section<sup><xref rid="fn4158">58</xref></sup> is mentioned here because the poor are like the stranger, the orphan, and the widow.<sup><xref rid="fn4159">59</xref></sup> God calls the poor <italic>My people</italic> because the pious do not seek to acquire wealth in this world, as can be seen from Elijah&#x2019;s behavior.<sup><xref rid="fn4160">60</xref></sup> Elisha, who did not want to accept Naaman&#x2019;s gift (II Kings 5:16), also proves this point.<sup><xref rid="fn4161">61</xref></sup> So does Samuel from Ramah.<sup><xref rid="fn4162">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WITH THEE.] Its meaning is, in the place where you dwell.</p>
<p>THOU SHALT NOT BE TO HIM AS A CREDITOR. In that he favors you because of your kindness. Scripture reads, <italic>tesimun</italic> (shall ye lay) because the lender, the scribe, and the witnesses all violate the law.<sup><xref rid="fn4163">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. IF THOU AT ALL TAKE THY NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S GARMENT TO PLEDGE. After saying <italic>salmat re&#x2019;ekha</italic> (thy neighbor&#x2019;s garment), which is the feminine,<sup><xref rid="fn4164">64</xref></sup> and similarly, after saying, <italic>ki hi kesuto levaddah</italic> (for that is his only covering) (v. 26).<sup><xref rid="fn4165">65</xref></sup> Scripture says, <italic>teshivennu</italic> (thou shalt restore it).<sup><xref rid="fn4166">66</xref></sup> Scripture reads <italic>teshivennu</italic> because it refers to the pledge.<sup><xref rid="fn4167">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon asks, what reason is there to take the pledge during the day and to return it at night? He answers, because the lender fears that the borrower might secure an additional loan from someone else and give him the pledge as security for the loan.</p>
<p>[26. FOR THAT IS HIS ONLY COVERING.] Its meaning is, you should pity him.</p>
<p>[FOR I AM GRACIOUS.] According to the Gaon the term <italic>chanun</italic> (gracious) is similar in meaning to <italic>channuni channuni</italic> (Have pity upon me, have pity on me) (Job 19:21).<sup><xref rid="fn4168">68</xref></sup> Its meaning is, I will give him money and take away your money. I believe that this is not the meaning of <italic>chaninah</italic> (graciousness). What did David seek in saying, <italic>Be gracious unto me, O God. according to Thy mercy</italic> (Ps. 51:3)?<sup><xref rid="fn4169">69</xref></sup> <italic>Chanun</italic> rather has the same meaning as the word <italic>rachum</italic> (merciful) although there is a difference between them,<sup><xref rid="fn4170">70</xref></sup> as I will note in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic>.</p>
<p>Now the phrase <italic>that I will hear</italic> which follows <italic>and it shall come to pass, when He crieth unto Me</italic> is similar to <italic>for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry &#x2014; My wrath shall wax hot</italic> (v. 22,23).<sup><xref rid="fn4171">71</xref></sup> How shall you know that <italic>I will surely hear their cry?</italic> You will know it from <italic>My wrath</italic> which follows.<sup><xref rid="fn4172">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. THOU SHALT NOT REVILE<sup><xref rid="fn4173">73</xref></sup> GOD. The reference is to the judges,<sup><xref rid="fn4174">74</xref></sup> namely, the priests, the sons of Levi, who have the Torah with them.</p>
<p>NOR CURSE<sup><xref rid="fn4175">75</xref></sup> A RULER OF THY PEOPLE. In secret or in public. The Geonim differentiated between revile and curse.<sup><xref rid="fn4176">76</xref></sup> The ruler spoken of in our verse is the king noted in Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>When we examined all the verses that come one after the other until <italic>And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed</italic> (Ex. 23:13), we discovered that most of them deal with the poor. They appear to be connected to the section <italic>If thou lend money&#x2026;to the poor</italic> (v. 24).</p>
<p>Yefet says the reason Scripture mentions <italic>Thou shalt not revile God</italic> is that if the lender should violate the law and not return the pledge,<sup><xref rid="fn4177">77</xref></sup> the poor man, while in pain during the night, might revile the judge who ruled that the lender should take the pledge.</p>
<p>28. THE FULNESS OF THY HARVEST, AND OF THE OUTFLOW OF THY PRESSES. <italic>Mele&#x2019;atekha</italic> (the fulness of thy harvest) is another name for wine and <italic>dimakha</italic> (the outflow)<sup><xref rid="fn4178">78</xref></sup> another name for oil. However, Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>mele&#x2019;atekha</italic> refers to both the fullness of the seed and the fullness of the winepress. He says that <italic>dimakha</italic> alludes to oil, because when an olive is pressed the oil drips like a tear (<italic>dema</italic>). Now this verse is explained elsewhere, namely, <italic>The first-fruits of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep</italic> (Deut. 18:4).<sup><xref rid="fn4179">79</xref></sup> Scripture therefore couples <italic>The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me</italic> with it.<sup><xref rid="fn4180">80</xref></sup> For the first-born are the first of one&#x2019;s strength.<sup><xref rid="fn4181">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ben Zuta says that <italic>mele&#x2019;atekha</italic> (the fulness of thy harvest) refers to pregnancy and <italic>dimakha</italic> (the outflow of the press) is another term for sperm, which is a drop. He also says that <italic>Thou shalt not delay</italic> means that one should not delay taking a wife. Hence, <italic>The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me</italic> follows it. However, this is sheer insanity. Why did Scripture mention <italic>mele&#x2019;atekha</italic> before <italic>dimakha</italic>? According to Ben Zuta, <italic>dimakha</italic> refers to the ejaculation of semen into a woman, which is then followed by pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy is not in the hand of man. It depends only upon God.<sup><xref rid="fn4182">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yefet says that this verse is mentioned so that the poor person does not delay to give that which he is obligated to give.<sup><xref rid="fn4183">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>[29. SHALT THOU DO WITH THINE OXEN, AND WITH THY SHEEP.] Likewise thou shalt give the first-born<sup><xref rid="fn4184">84</xref></sup> to the priest.</p>
<p>30. AND YE SHALL BE HOLY MEN UNTO ME. Since Scripture mentions <italic>thine oxen</italic> and <italic>thy sheep</italic>, which are permitted to be eaten, it warns one not to eat meat which is torn, for it is possible that a poor person might eat torn meat because of his poverty.<sup><xref rid="fn4185">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN THE FIELD.] Scripture speaks of what is most common. The same law applies if the animal was torn in the midst of a city. <italic>That chanceth him by night</italic> (Deut. 23:11)<sup><xref rid="fn4186">86</xref></sup> is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn4187">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>[TO THE DOGS.]<sup><xref rid="fn4188">88</xref></sup> The <italic>lamed</italic> prefaced to <italic>kelev</italic> (dogs) was vocalized with a <italic>pattach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4189">89</xref></sup> because the reference is to the dog who guards the oxen and the flock.<sup><xref rid="fn4190">90</xref></sup> Torn meat is not fit for anyone, only for a dog</p>
<p>Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that torn meat is unhealthier than meat from an animal that dies of natural causes. There is something poison-like in torn meat that is harmful to the health of a human being. Hence Scripture does not permit one to give torn meat <italic>unto the stranger that is within thy gates</italic> (Deut. 14:21) or to <italic>sell it unto a foreigner</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.) as it does to meat from an animal that dies of natural causes (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).</p>
<ftnote id="fn4101"><sup>1</sup> In other words, <italic>damim</italic> (literally, blood) means bloodshed. Hence <italic>en lo damim</italic> (there shall be no bloodguiltiness in him) means he is not guilty of bloodshed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4102"><sup>2</sup> The reference is to Rashi. Rashi interprets <italic>en lo damim</italic> (there shall be no bloodguiltiness in him): &#x201C;This is not murder. He is considered as dead to begin with.&#x201D; Also see Rashi on verse 2. &#x201C;<italic>Damim lo</italic> (there shall be bloodguiltiness for him): He is considered as a living person, and the owner of the house commits murder if he kills him.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4103"><sup>3</sup> <italic>He shall make restitution</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4104"><sup>4</sup> For the first part of our verse does not deal with what a thief steals. It deals rather with the circumstances under which an owner may kill a thief (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4105"><sup>5</sup> Which is connected to the first part of verse 8. See I.E. on Ex. 21:7,8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4106"><sup>6</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the <italic>bet</italic> prefaced to <italic>genevato</italic> (his theft) means because. Thus <italic>bi-genevato</italic> means because of his theft. The <italic>bet</italic> prefaced to a word usually means in. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4107"><sup>7</sup> Not only to an ox, ass, or sheep.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4108"><sup>8</sup> <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads: however, our sages, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4109"><sup>9</sup> Hebrew, <italic>gezerat ha-katuv</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4111"><sup>11</sup> That is, Ex. 21:28-36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4112"><sup>12</sup> Thus <italic>ki yaver ish</italic> means if a man sends his beast, i.e., he sends his beast to pasture. Indeed, this is how I.E. renders <italic>yaver</italic> in his short commentary. Similarly Rashi on verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4113"><sup>13</sup> The reference is apparently to <italic>yaver</italic> (Krinsky, Weiser). However, see next note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4114"><sup>14</sup> <italic>Yaver</italic>, as I.E. points out in his short commentary, is a <italic>hifil</italic>. Some believe that our text is corrupt and that we should emend it accordingly. See Krinsky and Weiser. However, according to Filwarg, I.E.&#x2019;s comment refers to <italic>bi&#x2019;er</italic> (feed), which is the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4115"><sup>15</sup> Literally, in another field. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4116"><sup>16</sup> In another field is short for in another man&#x2019;s field.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4117"><sup>17</sup> <italic>Ye that have eaten up the vineyard</italic> means ye have eaten up the vineyard which belongs to another.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4118"><sup>18</sup> <italic>Mavir</italic> and <italic>yaver</italic> are both <italic>hifils</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4119"><sup>19</sup> Our verse opens with <italic>If fire break out</italic>. It then goes on to say that the <italic>&#x201C;mavir&#x201D; shall surely make restitution</italic>. It is thus clear that <italic>ha-mavir</italic> means <italic>he that kindled</italic> [the fire].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4120"><sup>20</sup> In one verse or passage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4121"><sup>21</sup> Jud. 10:4 reads: <italic>And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts</italic> (ayarim), <italic>and they had thirty cities</italic> (ayarim), <italic>which are called Havvoth-jair</italic> (the villages of Jair) <italic>unto this day</italic>. It is highly unlikely that <italic>which are called Havvoth-jair</italic> refers to ass colts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4122"><sup>22</sup> The above verses 1-3 dealing with theft.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4123"><sup>23</sup> Begun in the earlier verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4124"><sup>24</sup> <italic>Whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor&#x2019;s goods</italic> indicates an oath; i.e., <italic>then the master of the house shall come near unto God&#x2026;</italic>[and shall swear] <italic>whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor&#x2019;s goods</italic>. So too Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4125"><sup>25</sup> That is, swore falsely (see Rashi). Since the previous verse deals with an oath taken by the bailee, the verse that follows deals with instances where the bailee commits perjury.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4126"><sup>26</sup> There is no such verse. II Kings 8:22 literally reads: &#x201C;Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah&#x2026;Then did Libnah revolt at the same time.&#x201D; I.E. probably quoted from memory and erred.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4127"><sup>27</sup> That is, oxen, asses, sheep, or raiment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4128"><sup>28</sup> Else.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4129"><sup>29</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s paraphrase, <italic>For every manner of trespass</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4130"><sup>30</sup> This is implied in <italic>every manner of trespass</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4131"><sup>31</sup> Explicitly mentioned in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4132"><sup>32</sup> That is, the judge.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4133"><sup>33</sup> A bailee, or keeper, who is paid for his services. This bailee is obligated to pay if what is placed in his charge is stolen or torn. See verse 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4134"><sup>34</sup> <italic>Melekhet</italic> (goods) is similar to the word <italic>melakhah</italic> (cattle) in <italic>According to the pace of the cattle</italic>. The word <italic>melakhah</italic> literally means work. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that it sometimes connotes goods, property, or anything that is one&#x2019;s &#x201C;work.&#x201D; See I.E. on Gen. 33:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4135"><sup>35</sup> He was paid to make sure this did not happen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4136"><sup>36</sup> The bailee does not have to pay for the animal, for the owner would not have permitted the bailee to overwork his animal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4137"><sup>37</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s interpretion of <italic>im sachir hu ba bi-secharo</italic> (if it be a hireling he loseth his hire) as: if a hired animal, while being accompanied by its lessee and lessor, was hurt or died, the lessee is not obligated to pay. See Weiser. See also Rashi who interprets differently.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4138"><sup>38</sup> Hence Scripture deals with this vice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4139"><sup>39</sup> And the one who sleeps with her is punished by death. See Deut. 22:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4140"><sup>40</sup> According to Rabbinic tradition there are two stages to marriage, <italic>erusin</italic> (betrothal) and <italic>kiddushin</italic> (sanctification). In the first stage the woman lives with her parents and is prohibited from having intercourse with her husband. In the second stage the women leaves her parent&#x2019;s home and takes up her domicile with her husband. In contemporary times the <italic>erusin</italic> and <italic>kiddushin</italic> take place at the same time. A woman who is an <italic>arusah</italic> is considered to be married even though she still lives with her parents. Thus a &#x201C;betrothed woman&#x201D; in Scripture does not refer to an engaged woman; it refers to a married woman.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4141"><sup>41</sup> Translated according to I.E. According to I.E., <italic>mahor yimharennah</italic> (he shall surely pay a dowry for her) is to be rendered: he shall surely attach himself to her; that is, he must marry her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4142"><sup>42</sup> Whereas <italic>mahor yimharennah</italic> is in the <italic>kal</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4143"><sup>43</sup> By bewitching in one way or another the objects of their desire.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4144"><sup>44</sup> The same law applies to a sorcerer. However, Scripture speaks of what is most usual.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4156"><sup>56</sup> That is, he can only cry out.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4157"><sup>57</sup> <italic>If thou lend</italic> implies that lending money to the poor is not an obligation. However, it is clear from Deut. 15:7-11 that one is obligated to lend money to the poor. Hence I.E. points out that one is obligated to lend money only if one has money to lend.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4158"><sup>58</sup> Verses 21-23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4159"><sup>59</sup> In that they are defenseless.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4160"><sup>60</sup> Scripture tells us that Elijah was <italic>girt with a girdle of leather about his loins</italic> (II Kings 1:8) and fed by ravens (I Kings 17:6). This, and the general description of Elijah&#x2019;s life in Scripture, led I.E. to conclude that Elijah was poor.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4164"><sup>64</sup> That is, <italic>salmat</italic> is in the feminine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4165"><sup>65</sup> <italic>Kesuto</italic> (his covering) is in the feminine. Actually, <italic>ki hi kesuto levaddah</italic> follows <italic>teshivennu</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4166"><sup>66</sup> <italic>Teshivennu</italic> is masculine. Scripture should have used <italic>teshevennah</italic> since both <italic>salmat</italic> and <italic>kesut</italic> are feminine nouns.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4167"><sup>67</sup> <italic>Chavul</italic> (pledge) is masculine. <italic>Teshivennu</italic> (thou shalt restore it) does not mean thou shalt return the garment but rather thou shalt return the pledge (see previous note).

<ftnote id="fn4168"><sup>68</sup> According to Saadiah the word <italic>chanun</italic> means gracious. Thus Job 19:21 should be rendered: be gracious to me, be gracious to me.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4179"><sup>79</sup> Deut. 18:4 is parallel to our verse and indicates that our verse deals with the first fruits.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4181"><sup>81</sup> They are thus similar to the first fruits.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4182"><sup>82</sup> According to Ben Zuta our verse commands a man to marry and have children, viz., <italic>The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me</italic>.

See I.E. on Gen. 1:22 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4183"><sup>83</sup> In other words, this verse is addressed to the poor. Yefet comments thus because most of our verses deal with the poor. See I.E.&#x2019;s notes on the previous verse.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 23</title>
<p>1. THOU SHALT NOT UTTER A FALSE REPORT. One should not invent fantasies in order to spread lies.</p>
<p>[PUT NOT THY HAND WITH THE WICKED.] Its meaning is, do not join a wicked person<sup><xref rid="fn4191">1</xref></sup> in testifying falsely to harm the innocent. A poor person might do this because of his poverty.<sup><xref rid="fn4192">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. THOU SHALT NOT FOLLOW A MULTITUDE TO DO EVIL. If you see many people testifying concerning something that you know nothing of, do not say to yourself all of these people cannot be lying.<sup><xref rid="fn4193">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon says that there are two commandments in this verse. One is a negative commandment,<sup><xref rid="fn4194">4</xref></sup> the other a positive commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn4195">5</xref></sup> The Gaon says that<sup><xref rid="fn4196">6</xref></sup> we are obligated to follow the majority,<sup><xref rid="fn4197">7</xref></sup> for Saadiah thought that the word <italic>le-hattot</italic> (to pervert) has the same meaning as <italic>li-netot</italic> (to turn).<sup><xref rid="fn4198">8</xref></sup> However, this is not the case. <italic>Le-hattot</italic> is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4199">9</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>matteh</italic> (perverteth) in <italic>Cursed be he that perverteth the justice due to the stranger, fatherless, and widow</italic> (Deut. 27:19). This form<sup><xref rid="fn4200">10</xref></sup> is also found without the word justice following it. See <italic>u-matteh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4201">11</xref></sup> <italic>ger</italic> (and pervert the stranger)<sup><xref rid="fn4202">12</xref></sup> (Mal. 3:5).</p>
<p>Our rabbis of blessed memory derived the law that the <italic>halakha</italic> follows the majority opinion from this verse.<sup><xref rid="fn4203">13</xref></sup> They transmitted the truth to us, for after Scripture states, <italic>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil</italic>, we learn that we are commanded to follow a multitude that wants to do good.<sup><xref rid="fn4204">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>NEITHER SHALT THOU BEAR WITNESS. This commandment falls upon all of Israel. How much more so is a judge, before whom a dispute comes, obligated to help his neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn4205">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. NEITHER SHALT THOU FAVOR A POOR MAN. This too is connected [to <italic>If thou lend money to any of My people even to the poor</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn4206">16</xref></sup> as you might think that you are doing good in helping the poor.<sup><xref rid="fn4207">17</xref></sup> Scripture elsewhere states, <italic>nor favor the person of the mighty</italic> (Lev. 19:15).<sup><xref rid="fn4208">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. THINE ENEMY&#x2019;S OX. <italic>Oyivkha</italic> (thine enemy&#x2019;s) is spelled with a <italic>chirik</italic> beneath the <italic>yod</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4209">19</xref></sup><italic> Oyivkha</italic> is a verb,<sup><xref rid="fn4210">20</xref></sup> for the word <italic>ve-ayavti</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn4211">21</xref></sup> (then I will be an enemy) (v. 22) is a transitive verb.<sup><xref rid="fn4212">22</xref></sup> Its meaning is, even though you know that he is your enemy.<sup><xref rid="fn4213">23</xref></sup> The same is true of the word <italic>sona&#x2019;akha</italic> (him that hateth thee) (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn4214">24</xref></sup> Scripture uses the term <italic>oyivkha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4215">25</xref></sup> because it is proper usage.<sup><xref rid="fn4216">26</xref></sup> This is also the case with <italic>sona&#x2019;akha</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4217">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that this section<sup><xref rid="fn4218">28</xref></sup> was written because if the ox and the ass belong to a poor person, then the reward for returning them is very great. One observes God&#x2019;s law and one also acts kindly with the poor.</p>
<p>5. THOU SHALT FORBEAR. <italic>Ve-chadalta</italic> (thou shalt forbear) is similar to <italic>chadal</italic> (forbear) (II Chron. 25:16), the meaning of which is, forbear from doing this thing.<sup><xref rid="fn4219">29</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-shamarta</italic> (and thou shalt observe) (Deut. 17:10) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn4220">30</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>ve-chadalta ma&#x2019;azov lo</italic> (thou shalt forbear to pass by him) is, forbear from leaving the matter<sup><xref rid="fn4221">31</xref></sup> to him alone. On the contrary, assist him in opening the knots<sup><xref rid="fn4222">32</xref></sup> and leave the burden as it is,<sup><xref rid="fn4223">33</xref></sup> and it will fall down on both sides of the donkey.<sup><xref rid="fn4224">34</xref></sup> The beast will then rise.<sup><xref rid="fn4225">35</xref></sup> Some say<sup><xref rid="fn4226">36</xref></sup> that its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn4227">37</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>va-ya&#x2019;azevu</italic> (and they restored) in <italic>and they restored Jerusalem</italic> (Neh. 3:8), its meaning being, thou shalt surely load the burden. However, this is far-fetched.</p>
<p>6. THOU SHALT NOT WREST THE JUDGMENT OF THY POOR. This is directed to judges.<sup><xref rid="fn4228">38</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt eat it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4229">39</xref></sup><italic> before the Lord thy God</italic> (Deut. 15:20) similarly refers to the one who is fit to eat it.<sup><xref rid="fn4230">40</xref></sup> Scripture, as it were, separates the <italic>kohen</italic> from the Israelites and addresses him.<sup><xref rid="fn4231">41</xref></sup> The person who says<sup><xref rid="fn4232">42</xref></sup> that the reference<sup><xref rid="fn4233">43</xref></sup> is to the first-born of the flock<sup><xref rid="fn4234">44</xref></sup> speaks nonsense.</p>
<p>7. KEEP THEE FAR FROM A FALSE MATTER. This<sup><xref rid="fn4235">45</xref></sup> is directed to judges. They are not to judge falsely.<sup><xref rid="fn4236">46</xref></sup> <italic>Justice, justice shalt thou follow</italic> (Deut. 16:20) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn4237">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE INNOCENT AND RIGHTEOUS SLAY THOU NOT. Those who are innocent and righteous in this case. If you know, that the defendant is wicked in some other matter do not say, because he committed some other horrible act, let me kill him and remove him from society.<sup><xref rid="fn4238">48</xref></sup> I will exact punishment from him and he will not escape My hand.<sup><xref rid="fn4239">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND THOU SHALT TAKE NO GIFT. This verse is also mentioned because the wealthy give bribes to the judges to divert justice from the poor.<sup><xref rid="fn4240">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND PERVERTETH THE WORDS OF THE RIGHTEOUS. Saadiah Gaon says that the word <italic>tzaddikim</italic> (righteous) modifies <italic>divre</italic> (words of).<sup><xref rid="fn4241">51</xref></sup> However, this is not possible, for <italic>divre</italic> is in the construct.<sup><xref rid="fn4242">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>[RIGHTEOUS.] <italic>Righteous</italic> refers to righteous in the matter before the judges, not righteous with regard to the observance of the commandments.</p>
<p>10. AND SIX YEARS. This too<sup><xref rid="fn4243">53</xref></sup> is mentioned because of <italic>that the poor of thy people may eat</italic> (v. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn4244">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. BUT THE SEVENTH YEAR THOU SHALT LET IT REST. This is the year that the Lord&#x2019;s release is proclaimed. One is then prohibited from exacting a debt from his needy neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn4245">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND LIE FALLOW. <italic>U-netashta</italic> (and lie fallow)<sup><xref rid="fn4246">56</xref></sup> means it shall not be sown. <italic>And we would forego</italic> (ve-nittosh)<sup><xref rid="fn4247">57</xref></sup> <italic>the seventh year</italic> (Neh. 10:32) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn4248">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. SIX DAYS. Scripture also mentions that <italic>the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger</italic>, who is in your gate, who is poor, and [who] hires himself out to you, <italic>may be refreshed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4249">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND IN ALL THINGS THAT I HAVE SAID UNTO YOU TAKE YE HEED. Scripture now mentions idolatry. <italic>And in all things that I have said unto you</italic> refers to God&#x2019;s commandments and ordinances. Observe them, not the ordinances of other gods. Scripture says, <italic>and make no mention of the name of other gods</italic> ; that is, do not mention their names in any oath or cause their adherents to swear by their names. The precise meaning of <italic>neither let it be heard out of thy mouth</italic> is: you shall not cause others to swear by their names; that is, do not tell an idolater, &#x201C;Swear to me by your god.&#x201D;</p>
<p>14. [THREE TIMES.] The meaning of <italic>regalim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4250">60</xref></sup> is times. You shall serve only Me. You shall serve Me three times a year by coming before Me like a servant who comes before his master to bring him a gift. Scripture therefore afterwards reads, <italic>el</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4251">61</xref></sup><italic> pene ha-adon Adonai</italic> (v. 17),<sup><xref rid="fn4252">62</xref></sup> the meaning of which is, <italic>before the Lord</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4253">63</xref></sup> <italic>God</italic> (v. 17). <italic>And none shall appear before Me empty</italic> (v. 15) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn4254">64</xref></sup> Scripture mentions this because pagans go to worship their vanities on specific days.<sup><xref rid="fn4255">65</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads, <italic>thou shalt keep a feast unto Me</italic>, the meaning of which is, only unto Me.</p>
<p>[THOU SHALT KEEP A FEAST.] The word <italic>tachog</italic> (thou shalt keep a feast) means thou shalt sacrifice. It is similar to the word <italic>chag</italic> (sacrifice) in <italic>tie the sacrifice with ropes</italic> (Ps. 118:27).<sup><xref rid="fn4256">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>TIMES. The word <italic>regalim</italic> comes from the same root as <italic>regel</italic> (foot), for most of the people come on foot.<sup><xref rid="fn4257">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD. Scripture starts with the festival of unleavened bread<sup><xref rid="fn4258">68</xref></sup> because it falls in the first month of the year.<sup><xref rid="fn4259">69</xref></sup> Now Scripture states, <italic>seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread</italic>. This is similar to <italic>Thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days</italic> (Deut. 16:13). It is thus an obligation.<sup><xref rid="fn4260">70</xref></sup> However, <italic>Six days thou shalt do thy work</italic> (v. 12) differs.<sup><xref rid="fn4261">71</xref></sup> For Scripture immediately states that one has to rest on the seventh day (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).<sup><xref rid="fn4262">72</xref></sup> <italic>Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread</italic> differs from it.<sup><xref rid="fn4263">73</xref></sup> Furthermore, why doesn&#x2019;t Scripture read, seven days you shall not eat leavened bread?<sup><xref rid="fn4264">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>IN THE MONTH ABIB. I have already explained this.</p>
<p>[AND NONE SHALL APPEAR BEFORE ME EMPTY.] Many think that <italic>ve-lo yera&#x2019;u fanai rekam</italic> (and none shall appear before Me empty) is like <italic>u-fanai lo yera&#x2019;u</italic> (but My face shall not be seen) (Ex. 33:23).<sup><xref rid="fn4265">75</xref></sup> However, this is incorrect, for those who come to the house of the Lord are there seen.<sup><xref rid="fn4266">76</xref></sup> <italic>Venireh et pene Adonai</italic> (That he may appear before the Lord) (I Sam. 1:22) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn4267">77</xref></sup> The phrase <italic>et pene Adonai</italic> in <italic>yera&#x2019;eh khol zekhurekha et pene Adonai</italic> (shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God) (Deut. 16:16) means before the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn4268">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THE FEAST OF HARVEST. The harvest of the first of the wheat. Now the barley crop which is what Abib refers to<sup><xref rid="fn4269">79</xref></sup> is always there when the festival of unleavened bread arrives. There are seven weeks from the arrival of the first barley to the arrival of the first wheat. Compare, <italic>Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee</italic> (Deut. 16:9).</p>
<p>AND THE FEAST OF INGATHERING, AT THE END OF THE YEAR. And a new year commences. Sowing begins in the month of Marcheshvan.<sup><xref rid="fn4270">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THREE TIMES. These three times, concerning which I said, <italic>None shall appear before Me empty</italic> (v. 15), was said only with regard to males who are of the age when they are obligated to observe the commandments. Those who are ill and cannot come are exempt.</p>
<p>18. THE BLOOD OF MY SACRIFICE. The reference is to the sacrifice of the paschal offering, which is eaten with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</p>
<p>THE FAT OF MY FEAST. The reference is to the unblemished lamb<sup><xref rid="fn4271">81</xref></sup> which one is obligated to offer. It is similarly written, <italic>in offering the portions that were to be burnt and the fat till the morning</italic> (II Chron. 35:14).<sup><xref rid="fn4272">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THE CHOICEST FIRST-FRUITS OF THY LAND. This is what <italic>And if thou bring a meal-offering of first-fruits unto the Lord</italic> (Lev. 2:14) refers to. As I will explain in its place, the verse<sup><xref rid="fn4273">83</xref></sup> is directed to the individual.<sup><xref rid="fn4274">84</xref></sup> Scripture mentions this law after <italic>Thou shalt not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread</italic> (v. 18), for the first fruits begin then.<sup><xref rid="fn4275">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THOU SHALT NOT SEETHE A KID IN ITS MOTHER&#x2019;S MILK.] The fools<sup><xref rid="fn4276">86</xref></sup> say that the word <italic>gedi</italic> (a kid) comes from the same root as <italic>meged</italic> (precious fruit).<sup><xref rid="fn4277">87</xref></sup> However, this is impossible, for the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>meged</italic> is a root letter. The word <italic>megadim</italic> (precious fruit) in <italic>with precious fruit</italic> (Cant. 4:13) is definite proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn4278">88</xref></sup> We do not find such a thing in the Hebrew language.<sup><xref rid="fn4279">89</xref></sup> Furthermore, how are we to explain <italic>lo tivashel</italic> (thou shalt not seethe)?<sup><xref rid="fn4280">90</xref></sup> A person cannot ripen the precious fruit. Indeed, Scripture states, <italic>And for the precious things</italic> (u-mi-meged) <italic>of the fruits of the sun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4281">91</xref></sup> (Deut. 33:14). Additionally, what reason is there to say <italic>in&#x2026;milk</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn4282">92</xref></sup> Where do we find such an expression?<sup><xref rid="fn4283">93</xref></sup> Additionally, what is the meaning of <italic>its mother&#x2019;s</italic>? Where else is the tree called the mother of the precious fruit? The fools came to this conclusion because they found this commandment coupled with <italic>The choicest first-fruits of thy land</italic>. <sup><xref rid="fn4284">94</xref></sup> Elsewhere we find this commandment<sup><xref rid="fn4285">95</xref></sup> coupled with <italic>Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself</italic> (Deut. 14:21). The latter is its proper place. However, it<sup><xref rid="fn4286">96</xref></sup> was only mentioned together with the first-fruits because the kids increase and grow then.<sup><xref rid="fn4287">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is another commentator who says that the meaning of <italic>Thou shalt not seethe</italic> is, thou shalt not prolong; that is, a kid shall not be with its mother more than seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn4288">98</xref></sup> Now if this is the case, why does Scripture mention this law again?<sup><xref rid="fn4289">99</xref></sup> Furthermore, their proof is in the phrase <italic>bashel katzir</italic> (the harvest is ripe) (Joel 4:13).<sup><xref rid="fn4290">100</xref></sup> However, the term <italic>bashel</italic> means to seethe,<sup><xref rid="fn4291">101</xref></sup> for the sun seethes like fire.<sup><xref rid="fn4292">102</xref></sup> It is the same case with <italic>hivshilu</italic> (ripe)<sup><xref rid="fn4293">103</xref></sup> in <italic>and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes</italic> (Gen. 40:10).</p>
<p>Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn4294">104</xref></sup> says that <italic>gedi</italic> (a kid) means young and tender. He says it applies to young oxen and young lambs. He claims that the phrase <italic>gedi izzim</italic> (a kid of the goats) (Gen. 38:17) proves this, since there is no reason to connect them.<sup><xref rid="fn4295">105</xref></sup> However, this is not so. The term <italic>gedi</italic> applies only to a goat. Thus in Arabic<sup><xref rid="fn4296">106</xref></sup> the term <italic>gedi</italic> means a goat. It is never used for any other kind. However, there is a difference between a <italic>gedi</italic> and a <italic>gedi izzim</italic>. A <italic>gedi</italic> is larger than a <italic>gedi izzim</italic>. A <italic>gedi izzim</italic> still needs to be with other goats. The same applies to the terms <italic>sa&#x2019;ir</italic> (a he-goat) and <italic>se&#x2019;ir izzim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4297">107</xref></sup> Our sages have received the tradition that an Israelite is not permitted to eat meat and milk.<sup><xref rid="fn4298">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will now explain.<sup><xref rid="fn4299">109</xref></sup> Note that it is the Torah&#x2019;s custom to speak of that which is most prevalent. For example, the Torah refers to the ostrich as a <italic>bat ha-ya&#x2019;anah</italic> (Lev. 11:16).<sup><xref rid="fn4300">110</xref></sup> Now why does the Torah do something here which it does not do in any other place? For in no other place does the Torah refer to an entire species by the term &#x201C;daughter of&#x201D; (<italic>bat</italic>). Note that the flesh of the <italic>ya&#x2019;anah</italic> is as dry as wood. It is not customary for people to eat it, as it contains no moisture. The only flesh of this species that is eaten is that of the &#x201C;daughter&#x201D; (<italic>bat</italic>), whose flesh has a little moisture in it because it is a young female.<sup><xref rid="fn4301">111</xref></sup> However, young ostrich males have no moisture in them.</p>
<p>Similarly, people do not eat meat and milk, for it is not pleasant to do so. Meat takes long to cook, but milk boils quickly.<sup><xref rid="fn4302">112</xref></sup> It is not the custom even today in the land of the Ishmaelites for a person to eat a lamb cooked in milk because the lamb is very moist and so is milk. It is thus harmful.<sup><xref rid="fn4303">113</xref></sup> Hence it is not eaten. On the other hand, the flesh of the kid contains no moisture. When a goat is small it is hot.<sup><xref rid="fn4304">114</xref></sup> Therefore they [inhabitants of Ishmaelite lands] cook the kid with milk.</p>
<p>Do not be surprised that the people of the surrounding areas are not in the habit of eating a kid of the goats.<sup><xref rid="fn4305">115</xref></sup> All the physicians admit that there is no comparable meat, and they even permit the sick to eat it. They similarly eat it in Spain, Africa, the Land of Israel, Persia, and Babylonia. It was similarly the custom of the ancients to eat it. We thus read: <italic>two good kids of the goats</italic> (Gen. 27:9); <italic>that we may make ready a kid for thee</italic> (Jud. 13:15). We also find that the <italic>kohen</italic> eats the kid of the goats that is brought as a sin offering (Lev. 6:19; 23:19,20).</p>
<p>It is because it is not the custom for a person to eat raw meat that the Torah prohibited a person from cooking a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk.<sup><xref rid="fn4306">116</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that <italic>bishul</italic> (seething) only applies to meat roasted over a fire.<sup><xref rid="fn4307">117</xref></sup> However, is it not written, <italic>u-vasel mevushal bamayim</italic> (sodden&#x2026;with water) (Ex. 12:9)? We similarly find that the Book of Chronicles states <italic>bi-shelu ba-sirot</italic> (sod they in pots) (II Chron. 35:13).</p>
<p>There is no need for us to search for the reason it is prohibited.<sup><xref rid="fn4308">118</xref></sup> The reason is hidden from the eyes of the intelligent. It is possible that it is prohibited to seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk because to do so is very cruel. The idea behind this law is like the idea behind <italic>And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day</italic> (Lev. 22:28), and <italic>thou shalt not take the dam with the young</italic> (Deut. 22:6).</p>
<p>It is the practice of most people that do not have a flock to buy milk in the market.<sup><xref rid="fn4309">119</xref></sup> In such a case the milk usually consists of a mixture coming from many goats. It is possible for the buyer of a kid not to know where the mother is.<sup><xref rid="fn4310">120</xref></sup> Now if the one who has bought a kid later buys milk, it is possible that some of this milk contains milk from the mother of the kid which he previously purchased. He will then violate the law.<sup><xref rid="fn4311">121</xref></sup> We must be strict when in doubt regarding a Biblical law.<sup><xref rid="fn4312">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Ishmaelites also admit that if one cooks a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk the resulting dish tastes better because the mother and the kid are similar in nature. Scripture speaks of what is most usual.</p>
<p>The ancients of blessed memory were strict in order to remove all doubt.<sup><xref rid="fn4313">123</xref></sup> They thus prohibited meat and milk.<sup><xref rid="fn4314">124</xref></sup> God who gave them wisdom will fully reward them. I will further explain in each of their respective places why Scripture noted this law a second<sup><xref rid="fn4315">125</xref></sup> and a third time.<sup><xref rid="fn4316">126</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. BEHOLD, I SEND AN ANGEL BEFORE THEE. God told Moses that he should also<sup><xref rid="fn4317">127</xref></sup> tell Israel that if they accept all the laws<sup><xref rid="fn4318">128</xref></sup> and ordinances, starting from <italic>Ye yourselves have seen</italic> (Ex. 20:19),<sup><xref rid="fn4319">129</xref></sup> then God would bring them into the land.</p>
<p>[AN ANGEL.] Many err concerning the angel. Some say that the angel refers to the Book of the Torah, for Scripture says, <italic>for My name is in him</italic> (v. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn4320">130</xref></sup> Others say that the reference is to the ark of the covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn4321">131</xref></sup> They interpret <italic>and hearken unto his voice</italic> (v. 21) as: and hearken to what is written in it.<sup><xref rid="fn4322">132</xref></sup> They also say that <italic>for he will not pardon your transgression</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>) means: for God will not pardon your transgressions. Now all of this is nonsense, as this theme<sup><xref rid="fn4323">133</xref></sup> is found throughout Scripture. We thus read: <italic>He will send His angel before thee</italic> (Gen. 24:7); <italic>the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil</italic> (Gen. 48:16). Moses similarly said, <italic>and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt</italic> (Num. 20:16). We likewise read, <italic>And the angel of His presence saved them</italic> (Is. 63:9); <italic>And the angel of the Lord went forth</italic> (Is. 37:36); <italic>and said to the angel that destroyed the people</italic> (II Sam. 24:16); <italic>My God hath sent His angel</italic> (Dan. 6:23); <italic>and the appearance of the fourth is like that of an angel</italic> (Dan. 3:25).<sup><xref rid="fn4324">134</xref></sup> There are many similar instances.</p>
<p>We read in the book of Daniel, <italic>The prince of Persia&#x2026;the prince of Greece</italic> (Dan 10:20); <italic>except Michael your prince</italic> (Dan. 10:21).<sup><xref rid="fn4325">135</xref></sup> Michael is the angel referred to as the great prince, for he is exalted above many others. Scripture also states regarding Michael, <italic>one of the first princes, came to help me</italic> (Dan. 10:13).<sup><xref rid="fn4326">136</xref></sup> The meaning of first is, first in rank. It is like <italic>and sat first in the kingdom</italic> (Esther 1:14). The angel referred to<sup><xref rid="fn4327">137</xref></sup> is Michael.</p>
<p>TO KEEP THEE BY THE WAY. So that nothing evil happens to you.</p>
<p>WHICH I HAVE PREPARED. For you. Our verse follows the idea <italic>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance</italic> (Deut. 32:8),<sup><xref rid="fn4328">138</xref></sup> which I will discuss later.</p>
<p>21. TAKE HEED OF HIM. Every angel follows God&#x2019;s command. The angel does not add or subtract from what God has commanded him.<sup><xref rid="fn4329">139</xref></sup> The same applies to Satan, who tormented Job.<sup><xref rid="fn4330">140</xref></sup> He was an angel. It was the same case with the angel who went out to hinder Balaam. Now, whoever hearkens to the voice of the angel is hearkening to the voice of God the glorious.</p>
<p>[BE NOT REBELLIOUS AGAINST HIM.] The word <italic>tammer</italic> (rebellious) is difficult. Its meaning appears to be similar to <italic>va-yamru</italic> (rebelled)<sup><xref rid="fn4331">141</xref></sup> in <italic>but they rebelled against Me</italic> (Ezek. 20:8). However, in this case our word should have read <italic>tamreh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4332">142</xref></sup> The Spanish scholars were therefore forced to say that <italic>tammer</italic> comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn4333">143</xref></sup> It is like <italic>vayassev</italic> (led about)<sup><xref rid="fn4334">144</xref></sup> in <italic>But the Lord led the people about</italic> (Ex. 13:18), for the entire form<sup><xref rid="fn4335">145</xref></sup> comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn4336">146</xref></sup> <italic>Venasevah</italic> (wound about) in <italic>were broader as they wound about</italic> (Ezek. 41:7) is a <italic>nifal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4337">147</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn4338">148</xref></sup> is like <italic>ve-navela</italic> (confound)<sup><xref rid="fn4339">149</xref></sup> in <italic>and there confound</italic> (Gen. 11:7), which comes from the same root as <italic>balal</italic> (mixed).<sup><xref rid="fn4340">150</xref></sup> It is also similar to <italic>ve-navekah</italic> (empty)<sup><xref rid="fn4341">151</xref></sup> in <italic>And the spirit of Egypt shall be made empty</italic> (Is. 19:3), which comes from the same root as <italic>bokek</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4342">152</xref></sup> (empty) (Is. 24:1). Do not be surprised that we have two roots<sup><xref rid="fn4343">153</xref></sup> with one meaning. For we find this to be the case with the words <italic>sorer</italic> (bear rule)<sup><xref rid="fn4344">154</xref></sup> and <italic>sarita</italic> (striven)<sup><xref rid="fn4345">155</xref></sup> in <italic>that every man shall bear rule</italic> (sorer) <italic>in his own house</italic> (Esther 1:22) and in <italic>for thou hast striven</italic> (sarita) <italic>with God</italic> (Gen. 32:29). The same is true of <italic>tammer</italic> (rebellious) in <italic>be not rebellious against him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4346">156</xref></sup> and <italic>memer</italic> (rebellious) in <italic>And rebellious to her that bore him</italic> (Prov. 17:25).<sup><xref rid="fn4347">157</xref></sup> <italic>Memer</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>mekhes</italic> (tribute) (Num. 31:28), which comes from the same root as <italic>takhossu</italic> (ye shall make your count) in <italic>ye shall make your count for the lamb</italic> (Ex. 12:4). It comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn4348">158</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FOR MY NAME IS IN HIM.] Note that <italic>for My name is in him</italic> is connected to <italic>Take heed of him, and hearken unto his voice</italic> (v. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn4349">159</xref></sup> It is like <italic>And also unto thy bondwoman thou shalt do likewise</italic> (Deut. 15:17).<sup><xref rid="fn4350">160</xref></sup></p>
<p>I have already explained that God&#x2019;s glorious name<sup><xref rid="fn4351">161</xref></sup> is a proper name, as it refers only to the Lord. It is also found as an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn4352">162</xref></sup> For God is all, and all comes from Him.<sup><xref rid="fn4353">163</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN HIM.] God is said to be <italic>in him</italic> in the same sense that the center of a circle is equally distant to all points on the circumference of the circle.<sup><xref rid="fn4354">164</xref></sup> It is only in this sense that Scripture tells us that God&#x2019;s glory is in the midst of the camp,<sup><xref rid="fn4355">165</xref></sup> and that the Lord&#x2019;s glory journeys in the camps.<sup><xref rid="fn4356">166</xref></sup> It is thus written, <italic>that Thou Lord art in the midst of this people</italic> (Num. 14:14). Scripture likewise reads, <italic>And formed the spirit of man within him</italic> (Zech. 12:1).<sup><xref rid="fn4357">167</xref></sup></p>
<p>Do not be astonished that Scripture first reads, <italic>But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto</italic> his <italic>voice</italic> (Ex. v. 22) and then goes on to say, <italic>and do all that</italic> I <italic>speak</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).<sup><xref rid="fn4358">168</xref></sup> I will give you an example by which you can understand the above. All the scientists who study astronomy have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the moon is a body which receives its light from the sun, for the moon has no light.<sup><xref rid="fn4359">169</xref></sup> It is for this reason that the sun grows dark when the moon joins it<sup><xref rid="fn4360">170</xref></sup> during the day.<sup><xref rid="fn4361">171</xref></sup> The sun and the moon are both embedded in spheres that are similar to the spheres of the constellations.<sup><xref rid="fn4362">172</xref></sup> The darkness results only from the fact that the moon, which like the sun is circular, passes beneath the sun.<sup><xref rid="fn4363">173</xref></sup> Now the side of the moon which faces the sun is totally illuminated. However, the side which is above it is dark. It is not illuminated. Observe that the moon thereby blocks the light of the sun. The moon is also left without light even in the middle of a lunar month<sup><xref rid="fn4364">174</xref></sup> if the shadow of the earth comes between it and the sun.<sup><xref rid="fn4365">175</xref></sup> Look&#x0021; We know that the light of the moon at night illuminates the air. Now if Reuben calls the light of the moon moonlight, he speaks the truth. If Simeon refers to the light of the moon as sunlight, he too speaks the truth.<sup><xref rid="fn4366">176</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. [AN ADVERSARY.] The wise men of Spain found the word <italic>evah</italic> (enmity)<sup><xref rid="fn4367">177</xref></sup> spelled with a silent <italic>yod</italic> (Gen. 3:15). However, our verse reads, <italic>ve-ayavti</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4368">178</xref></sup> <italic>et oyevekha</italic> (I will be an enemy unto thine enemies).<sup><xref rid="fn4369">179</xref></sup> They also found Scripture reading <italic>tzed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4370">180</xref></sup> <italic>chayyah</italic> (in hunting any beast) (Lev. 17:13) and <italic>tzayyadim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4371">181</xref></sup> (hunters) (Jer. 16:16). They also found the word <italic>din</italic> (the cause) in <italic>They plead not the cause of the poor</italic> (Jer. 5:28)<sup><xref rid="fn4372">182</xref></sup> and <italic>dayyan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4373">183</xref></sup> (judge) in <italic>The Lord therefore be judge</italic> (I Sam. 24:16). They therefore said that a verb has no less than three letters.<sup><xref rid="fn4374">184</xref></sup> Hence <italic>evah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4375">185</xref></sup> comes from a root whose middle letter is silent.<sup><xref rid="fn4376">186</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. FOR. God commanded Israel to remove all idols immediately upon coming to the Land of Israel. He mentioned six nations and did not bother to mention the smallest among them.<sup><xref rid="fn4377">187</xref></sup> It is concerning the latter that God said, <italic>and I will</italic> [<italic>immediately</italic>] <italic>cut him off</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4378">188</xref></sup> As to the others, <italic>By little and little I will drive them out</italic> (v. 29). It is also possible that <italic>and I will cut him off</italic> means: and I will cut off each one of them. It is like <italic>Its branches run over the wall</italic> (Gen. 49:22).<sup><xref rid="fn4379">189</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. THOU SHALT NOT BOW DOWN TO THEIR GODS. This is what I referred to earlier when I said that the Book of the Covenant<sup><xref rid="fn4380">190</xref></sup> opens and closes with a warning against idol worship. For <italic>Ye yourselves have seen</italic> (Ex. 20:19), which opens the Book of the Covenant, is a warning against idolatry, as is <italic>for they will be a snare unto thee</italic> (v. 33), which closes the book. However, there is a difference between the two. At the beginning of the book God commanded [Israel] not to make a god of silver alongside the Lord. At the end of the book He commanded Israel to uproot from the land of Canaan all the idols that its inhabitants had made. For whoever worships idols violates, as it were, all the negative commandments of the Torah. Furthermore, all of the positive commandments which he observes are of no avail to him in this world or in the next world.</p>
<p>25. AND YE SHALL SERVE THE LORD&#x2026;HE WILL BLESS THY BREAD AND THY WATER. Its meaning is, you shall serve only the Lord who took you out of the house of bondage and brought you to the land of nations which served other gods who were not able to save them from your hands. Serving God is defined as doing all that the Lord has commanded, namely, to love the Lord, to cleave unto Him, to swear by His name, to pray to Him, to sacrifice the daily and the additional offerings unto Him and to honor Him by giving tithes. One who does the above has his reward with him.<sup><xref rid="fn4381">191</xref></sup> The latter consists of the following four things<sup><xref rid="fn4382">192</xref></sup> which he will receive in this world. One, <italic>And He</italic> (God) <italic>will bless thy bread and thy water</italic>. Two, <italic>I</italic> (God) <italic>will take sickness away from the midst of thee</italic>. Three, <italic>None shall miscarry, nor be barren, in thy land</italic> (v. 26). Four, <italic>The number of thy days I</italic> (God) <italic>will fulfill</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.). Now all of these rewards pertain to the body. In addition, God will do the reverse of these blessings to your enemies; namely, <italic>I will send</italic></p>
<p><italic>My terror before thee</italic> (v. 27); <italic>And I will send the hornet before thee</italic> (v. 28).</p>
<p>Abraham the author writes: There are some great scholars who are very learned in the two laws<sup><xref rid="fn4383">193</xref></sup> but have not studied the sciences. I therefore cannot begin to explain the abovementioned blessings without first mentioning a bit of the sciences.<sup><xref rid="fn4384">194</xref></sup> Man&#x2019;s body comes from the lowest world. However, man&#x2019;s soul (<italic>neshamah</italic>), which is tied to the body,<sup><xref rid="fn4385">195</xref></sup> comes from on high. There are two powers that are intermediate between the body and the soul. These two powers are referred to in the main in Hebrew as <italic>ru&#x2019;ach</italic> (spirit) and <italic>nefesh</italic> (life force, appetite, desire), for the soul (<italic>neshamah</italic>) is the rational part of man and its place is in the brain of man. From it comes the power of all emotions and the desire to move.<sup><xref rid="fn4386">196</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>ru&#x2019;ach</italic> (spirit) is situated in the heart. Life depends on the <italic>ru&#x2019;ach</italic>. The <italic>ru&#x2019;ach</italic> desires to dominate; that is, it seeks to overcome all opposition. It is the source of anger. Solomon similarly said, <italic>Be not hasty in thy spirit</italic> (ruchakha) <italic>to be angry</italic> (Eccles. 7:9), and <italic>A fool spendeth all his spirit</italic> (rucho) (Prov. 29:11). The seat of the <italic>nefesh</italic> (life force, appetite, desire) is in the liver. It is the <italic>nefesh</italic> that desires to eat. It is thus written, <italic>because thy soul</italic> (nafshekha) <italic>desires</italic> (Deut. 12:20). The <italic>nefesh</italic> is the source of sexual desire. Now some people are created in such a way that these three souls are strong. In others they are weak. In other instances one soul is strong, another weak, or neither weak nor strong. Now, people fall into twenty-seven categories.<sup><xref rid="fn4387">197</xref></sup></p>
<p>God gave the Torah to strengthen, to intensify, and to increase the power of man&#x2019;s supernal soul. When this happens the body does not rule over it. However, if the Torah is not observed, then the body overpowers the <italic>neshamah</italic>. I will explain<sup><xref rid="fn4388">198</xref></sup> with the following parable. We know from the teachings of the sciences that any person whose constitution is overcome by red bile will be angry, for this is the nature of fire<sup><xref rid="fn4389">199</xref></sup> and red bile is like fire. Now when the <italic>neshamah</italic> is unintelligent it pursues the wants of the body because it cannot overcome its desires. Additionally, let us consider a person who is not by nature hot. If another person comes along and curses him to the point where he becomes angry, he begets heat in his body which was not there before he became angry.</p>
<p>God the exalted, in his kindness, chose Israel and taught them His Torah. If Israel observes the Torah they become wise. Their wisdom guides them in a straight path to all things that will not harm them. The general rule is: the body must be subservient to the dictates of the soul (<italic>neshamah</italic>) rather than the soul being subservient to the dictates of the body. When the soul (<italic>neshamah</italic>) is strong, then the heavenly power known as nature, which preserves the body, grows in might.</p>
<p>Now our verse tells us that God&#x2019;s blessing shall be upon all our food and drink. For there is a curse that adversely effects the power of nature, as in <italic>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied</italic> (Micah 6:14). Observe that all illnesses come from the food that enters the body. Now a person who observes the Torah will not fear them. This is the meaning of <italic>and He will bless thy bread</italic>. There are other diseases that come from outside the body due to a change in the air caused by a shift in the arrangement of the planets. It is concerning this that our verse states, <italic>and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee</italic>. Look, a person who observes the Torah has no need for a physician along with God the Revered. Scripture thus writes, <italic>yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians</italic> (II Chron. 16:12).</p>
<p>I have thus spoken on the science of medicine. I will now speak on the science dealing with the heavenly bodies. Note that what befalls human beings depends on the alignment of the planets and what their arrangement indicates at the time of a person&#x2019;s birth. The aforementioned is extremely difficult to understand. If a woman is born under an arrangement that decrees she will not be able to carry her children to term, then it will be the nature of her womb to abort the children in it. The same is true if the woman is born under an arrangement that decrees that she be barren and not have children.</p>
<p>Now if a person who is born under an arrangement of the planets that determines that he will have a physical makeup that is unable to beget children cleaves to God, then if he truly cleaves to God, the revered God will strengthen the power of this man&#x2019;s kidneys and see to it that his sperm functions properly so that he will be able to have children. God therefore told Abraham, <italic>I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be thou whole-hearted</italic> (Gen. 17:1). This is what the rabbis meant by &#x201C;Cease thy planet gazing.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn4390">200</xref></sup> God told Abraham, &#x201C;If you make a treaty to serve Me, I will greatly multiply you, as I will overcome what nature has decreed for you.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn4391">201</xref></sup> This is not a victory over the arrangements of the stars,<sup><xref rid="fn4392">202</xref></sup> for they were not created to do good or ill to the lowest world. On the contrary, they always go and do the service of God, as that is what they need to do. The inhabitants of the lowest world receive a thing and its opposite<sup><xref rid="fn4393">203</xref></sup> from them in accordance with their desire. Thus if we observe the Torah we will not receive evil from the heavenly bodies.<sup><xref rid="fn4394">204</xref></sup> I will yet speak on this in the Torah portion <italic>Ki Tissa</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4395">205</xref></sup> The third blessing<sup><xref rid="fn4396">206</xref></sup> is a blessing to the effect that all of Israel have children and that none of their children die in the lifetime of their parents.</p>
<p>26. [BARREN.] The reference is both to one&#x2019;s wife and to his cattle.</p>
<p>[THE NUMBER OF THY DAYS I WILL FULFILL.] This, the fourth blessing, is a blessing for long life.</p>
<p>We know that there is a fixed and established time to every person&#x2019;s life in accordance with the heat and moisture which are the natural components of the human body. One&#x2019;s life is not fixed in accordance with the foreign fire<sup><xref rid="fn4397">207</xref></sup> and foreign moisture which are unnatural components of the body.<sup><xref rid="fn4398">208</xref></sup> The person who cleaves to God strengthens his body&#x2019;s heat and moisture through the power of his soul. Such a person will live longer than his allotted life span. We thus read, <italic>The fear of the Lord prolongeth days</italic> (Prov. 10:27). It is also stated, <italic>In the midst of his days he shall leave them</italic> (Jer. 17:11).<sup><xref rid="fn4399">209</xref></sup> We further read, <italic>but the Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die</italic> (I Sam. 26:10). Now a person who dies in war or in a plague does not die on the day set aside for his death in accordance with the nature of the heat and moisture in his body. He dies because of outside events. Now if a person cleaves to God, the Lord will save him from all of these things.</p>
<p>We find that the Torah states, <italic>lest he die in battle</italic> (Deut. 20:5). We also read, <italic>why shouldest thou die before thy time</italic> (Eccles. 7:17). This does not contradict the science of astrology. For a star&#x2019;s decree is dependent upon many things, as I will explain in commenting on <italic>so that we are distinguished, I and Thy people</italic> (Ex. 33:16). Scripture therefore states, <italic>behold, I will add unto thy days</italic> (Is. 38:5). Why should I continue to go on and on?<sup><xref rid="fn4400">210</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. I WILL SEND MY TERROR. The reference is to a fear in the soul. The body immediately weakens.<sup><xref rid="fn4401">211</xref></sup> This is what <italic>and I will make all thine enemies&#x2019; necks towards thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4402">212</xref></sup> refers to. Its meaning is: your enemies will turn their necks to you; that is, they will flee from you when you look at them.</p>
<p>28. AND I WILL SEND THE HORNET. The reference is to a plague in the body which saps its strength. The word <italic>tzirah</italic> (hornet) comes from the same root as <italic>tzara&#x2019;at</italic> (leprosy).<sup><xref rid="fn4403">213</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture mentions three of the seven Canaanite nations. However, the same applies to all of the other Canaanite nations. It is also possible that this plague ravaged these three nations more than it did the others.<sup><xref rid="fn4404">214</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. I WILL NOT. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that this<sup><xref rid="fn4405">215</xref></sup> will serve as a sign. When Israel will see that they have become fruitful and multiplied, then the seven nations will be uprooted.<sup><xref rid="fn4406">216</xref></sup> However, there is no need for this interpretation, for Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn4407">217</xref></sup> mentions the reason that God will not drive out the Canaanites in one year, namely, <italic>lest the land become desolate</italic>. The borders of the Land of Israel will be too large for those who left Egypt to be able to settle all of it.<sup><xref rid="fn4408">218</xref></sup> <italic>Pen</italic> (lest) in <italic>lest the land</italic> is like <italic>pen</italic> (lest) in <italic>lest the fulness of the seed&#x2026;.be forfeited</italic> (Deut. 22:9).<sup><xref rid="fn4409">219</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. BY LITTLE AND LITTLE. Until you increase and are able to inhabit the entire land. Scripture now goes on to describe the length and breadth of the land.</p>
<p>31. AND I WILL SET THY BORDER. This is what <italic>May he have dominion also from sea to sea, And from the River unto the ends of the earth</italic> (Ps. 72:8) refers to. <italic>The River</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4410">220</xref></sup> refers to the Euphrates.</p>
<p>[32. THOU SHALT MAKE NO COVENANT WITH THEM.] Do not make a covenant with them in any case.<sup><xref rid="fn4411">221</xref></sup></p>
<p>[NOR WITH THEIR GODS.] Its meaning is, you shall destroy their gods.<sup><xref rid="fn4412">222</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. THEY SHALL NOT DWELL IN THY LAND. When you increase, you shall destroy and annihilate all the seven nations.</p>
<p>The Book of the Covenant ends here.</p>

<ftnote id="fn4197"><sup>7</sup> Our verse ends with the words <italic>achare rabbim le-hattot</italic>. Saadiah, like the Talmud (<italic>San</italic>. 2a), interprets this to mean you shall follow the majority; that is, legal questions are decided by the majority opinion of the court.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4198"><sup>8</sup> Or follow. Hence Saadiah interpreted <italic>achare rabbim le-hattot</italic> as you shall follow the majority. It should be noted that both <italic>li-netot</italic> and <italic>le-hattot</italic> come from the same root, <italic>nun, tet, heh</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4210"><sup>20</sup> <italic>Oyivkha</italic> is not an adjective. It is a transitive participle meaning your hater, i.e., the one who actively hates you.</ftnote>

According to this interpretation the words <italic>lo yera&#x2019;u</italic> refer to God&#x2019;s face (<italic>fanai</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4266"><sup>76</sup> Hence <italic>ve-lo yera&#x2019;u fanai rekam</italic> means: and none shall appear before My face [or before Me] empty. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>ve-lo yera&#x2019;u</italic> in <italic>ve-lo yera&#x2019;u fanai</italic> refers to the worshipper but <italic>lo yera&#x2019;u</italic> in <italic>u-fanai lo yera&#x2019;u</italic> refers to God&#x2019;s face.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4267"><sup>77</sup> That it is the worshipper who is said to be seen before God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4268"><sup>78</sup> Not the face of God. <italic>Yera&#x2019;eh</italic> is a <italic>nifal</italic> and refers to <italic>khol zekhurekha</italic> (all thy males) rather than to <italic>et pene Adonai</italic>. I.E. comments thus because <italic>et pene Adonai</italic> might be taken to mean the face of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4269"><sup>79</sup> According to I.E., <italic>chodesh ha-aviv</italic> means the month when the first barley appears.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4270"><sup>80</sup> The Torah seems to tell us that the year comes to a close towards the end of Tishri (Sukkot falls in the middle of Tishri). However, the new year begins with Tishri. Hence I.E. points out that Scripture here speaks of an agricultural year. That year ends in Tishri with the fall harvest and begins in Marcheshvan when the new crop is sown.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4271"><sup>81</sup> The paschal lamb. See Ex 12:5. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>the blood of My sacrifice</italic> and <italic>the fat of My feast</italic> refer to the same animal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4272"><sup>82</sup> There is apparently an error in the text. Chronicles reads: <italic>in offering the portions that were to be burnt and the fat until night</italic>. It is possibly a scribal error. On the other hand, I.E. may have quoted from memory and erred. If I.E. quoted the verse properly, then he is offering proof from Chronicles that the fat of offering was not allowed to remain overnight (Krinsky). In his short commentary, I.E. explains that the fat of the paschal lamb could be burnt till the morning because of the many sacrifices offered. He quoted II Chron. 35:14 to illustrate the normal procedure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4273"><sup>83</sup> Lev. 2:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4274"><sup>84</sup> Rather than the community. According to Rashi, Lev. 2:14 speaks of the <italic>Omer</italic> which the community is obligated to offer. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment. See Rashi on Lev. 2:14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4275"><sup>85</sup> One is permitted to start enjoying one&#x2019;s first fruits from the second day of Passover. See Lev. 22:9-14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4276"><sup>86</sup> The Karaites. Cf. I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4277"><sup>87</sup> From the root <italic>mem, gimel, dalet</italic>. These commentators interpret <italic>lo tivashel gedi ba-chalev immo</italic> (thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk) as you shall not ripen the fruit in the juices of its tree. See below.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4278"><sup>88</sup> That the <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>megadim</italic> is a root letter. Compare, <italic>melekh, melakhim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4279"><sup>89</sup> That the first letter of a root that ordinarily does not drop any letters should fall out and a new form be created. Hence the word <italic>gedi</italic> cannot mean precious fruit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4280"><sup>90</sup> These commentators explain <italic>lo tivashel</italic> (thou shalt not seethe) as you shall not ripen. It should be noted that the Hebrew word for ripen and the Hebrew word for cook both come from the root <italic>bet, shin, lamed</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4281"><sup>91</sup> The sun, not man, ripens the precious fruit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4282"><sup>92</sup> If the reference is to its juices.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4283"><sup>93</sup> That is, where do we find milk referring to the juice of a fruit?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4284"><sup>94</sup> They thus concluded that this verse teaches that the first fruits are to be picked immediately and not allowed to ripen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4285"><sup>95</sup> <italic>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4286"><sup>96</sup> <italic>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4287"><sup>97</sup> At the time wherein the first fruits appear.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4288"><sup>98</sup> The reference is to a kid that is first-born. See Ex. 22:29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4289"><sup>99</sup> After already having mentioned it in Ex. 22:29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4290"><sup>100</sup> Joel 4:13 reads, <italic>Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe</italic> (bashel). This commentator interprets the verse as: Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest has been long on the vine. <italic>Lo tevashel gedi bachalev immo</italic> similarly means: Do not leave the kid so that it continues to nurse its mother milk.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4291"><sup>101</sup> Not to leave, or prolong its stay.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4292"><sup>102</sup> Thus <italic>bashel katzir</italic> literally means the harvest has been seethed, i.e., ripened.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4293"><sup>103</sup> <italic>Hivshilu</italic> literally means they caused it to cook.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4294"><sup>104</sup> Rashi. This is also the opinion of the Talmud. See <italic>Hullin</italic> 113b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4295"><sup>105</sup> That is, to connect <italic>gedi</italic> to <italic>izzim</italic>. In other words, if <italic>gedi</italic> means a young goat, then Gen. 38:17 should have read <italic>gedi</italic>, not <italic>gedi izzim</italic>, for <italic>gedi izzim</italic> means a young goat of the goats.

<ftnote id="fn4297"><sup>107</sup> A <italic>se&#x2019;ir izzim</italic> cannot survive on its own. It has to be with other goats.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4298"><sup>108</sup> That is, our sages have received the tradition that our verse teaches that an Israelite may not eat meat and milk. See <italic>Hullin</italic> 113b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4299"><sup>109</sup> The meaning of <italic>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk</italic> and the Rabbinic tradition based on it, regarding the prohibition of eating meat and milk.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4300"><sup>110</sup> Literally, the daughter of wailing. In Leviticus chapter 11, the Torah lists the animals which may or may not be eaten. The only species which is referred to as a <italic>bat</italic> is the ostrich.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4301"><sup>111</sup> The Torah refers to an ostrich as a <italic>bat</italic> because that is the type of ostrich that is usually eaten by those who eat ostriches.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4302"><sup>112</sup> I.E. believed that food that does not cook equally should not be prepared in the same pot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4303"><sup>113</sup> According to medieval medicine there are four humors: dry, hot, moist, and dry. An imbalance of these humors was thought to cause illness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4304"><sup>114</sup> And cooks quickly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4305"><sup>115</sup> I.E. took pains to point out that the fact that people did not eat kid meat in the area where he wrote his commentary does not negate his earlier point. He had explained that the reason Scripture reads, <italic>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk</italic>, rather than &#x201C;thou shalt not seethe meat in milk&#x201D; was that people do the former and not the latter. People do not refrain from eating goat&#x2019;s meat because of health reasons. They do so because of local idiosyncrasies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4306"><sup>116</sup> I.E. is explaining why Scripture prohibited a kid cooked with milk but did not prohibit the eating of raw kid meat and milk.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4307"><sup>117</sup> Hence <italic>lo tivashel</italic> (thou shalt not seethe) means thou shalt not roast.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4308"><sup>118</sup> To seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4309"><sup>119</sup> If the reason for the prohibition of seething a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk is cruelty, then the prohibition applies only to its own mother&#x2019;s milk and to no one else&#x2019;s. I.E. thus wants to explain why it is prohibited to seethe a kid in any milk that is purchased.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4310"><sup>120</sup> He would know which animal is its mother only if the kid was born in his house.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4311"><sup>121</sup> If he cooks the kid in the milk which he has newly purchased.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4312"><sup>122</sup> Hence one is not permitted to cook a kid in any milk that was purchased.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4313"><sup>123</sup> That one never accidentally seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4314"><sup>124</sup> They prohibited seething a kid in the milk of an animal which is not its mother. They also prohibited having milk with any meat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4315"><sup>125</sup> Ex. 24:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4316"><sup>126</sup> Deut. 14:21. I.E. never did explain it (Weiser).</ftnote>

Do not be amazed that God first said, <italic>Come up</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4415">3</xref></sup> <italic>unto the Lord</italic> (v. 1) and then, <italic>And Moses alone shall come near unto the Lord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn4416">4</xref></sup> rather than, and <italic><span class="underline">you</span></italic> will come near unto the Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn4417">5</xref></sup> for this is Hebrew style.<sup><xref rid="fn4418">6</xref></sup> We thus read, <italic>Then the Lord caused to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven</italic> (Gen. 19:24), the meaning of which is, from Him.<sup><xref rid="fn4419">7</xref></sup> However, Samuel said, <italic>And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel</italic> (I Sam. 12:11). Samuel did not say, and me.<sup><xref rid="fn4420">8</xref></sup> There are many such instances.</p>
<p>3. AND MOSES CAME. Scripture does not mention that Moses came down from the mountain<sup><xref rid="fn4421">9</xref></sup> because there was no need to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn4422">10</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord</italic> is, and Moses came in the midst of the camp of Israel and told the people all the positive and negative commandments that are codified between <italic>ye your-selves have seen</italic> (Ex. 20:19) and <italic>for they will be a snare unto thee</italic> (Ex. 23:33).<sup><xref rid="fn4423">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ALL THE ORDINANCES. Which he placed before them. They are mentioned in this portion.<sup><xref rid="fn4424">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ALL THE PEOPLE ANSWERED. As if they were one person.<sup><xref rid="fn4425">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND MOSES WROTE. After Moses related all the words of God, the commandments, and the ordinances, he wrote them down. This is what the Book of the Covenant consists of.</p>
<p>AND BUILDED AN ALTAR UNDER THE MOUNT. At the place where Israel stood at the time that the Torah was given. The word <italic>va-yiven</italic> (and builded) is to be read as if written twice. Our verse is to be read as if written: and he builded twelve pillars.<sup><xref rid="fn4426">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND HE SENT THE YOUNG MEN OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The reference is to the young men who were the sons of the chosen<sup><xref rid="fn4427">15</xref></sup> elders who were to go up on the mountain with Moses.</p>
<p>WHO OFFERED BURNT-OFFERINGS. This is what <italic>and shalt sacrifice thereon</italic> (Ex. 20:21) refers to.</p>
<p>Scripture mentions that oxen were offered as peaceofferings because many people partook of the peaceofferings.<sup><xref rid="fn4428">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND MOSES TOOK HALF OF THE BLOOD. Of the burnt and peaceofferings.</p>
<p>[BASINS.] The word <italic>agganot</italic> (basins) refers to round vessels. Compare, <italic>aggan ha-sahar</italic> (round goblets) (Cant. 7:3). It is <italic>ajan</italic> in Arabic.</p>
<p>AND HALF OF THE BLOOD. Of the burnt and peaceofferings <italic>he dashed against the altar</italic> for God. Observe, the word <italic>agganot</italic> is to be read as if written twice. Moses placed half of the blood in basins, and he also placed the other half of the blood in basins.<sup><xref rid="fn4429">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND HE TOOK. When Moses read the Book of the Covenant to the elders and they accepted it upon themselves, he then took the remaining half of blood<sup><xref rid="fn4430">18</xref></sup> and sprinkled it upon the people, that is, the elders, for they stood for all of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn4431">19</xref></sup> We similarly find the same regarding the bullock offered for an error made by the congregation. We read there, <italic>And the elders of the congregation</italic>, who were representing all of Israel, <italic>shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock</italic> (Lev. 4:15).</p>
<p>[AND SPRINKLED IT UPON THE PEOPLE.] This sprinkling<sup><xref rid="fn4432">20</xref></sup> is like <italic>and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments</italic> (Lev. 8:30).</p>
<p>[BEHOLD THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT.] Moses called it the blood of the covenant.</p>
<p>9. THEN WENT UP MOSES. Scripture does not mention the mountain because there was no need to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn4433">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND THEY SAW THE GOD OF ISRAEL. In a prophetic vision. It is similar to <italic>I saw the Lord sitting on His throne</italic> (I Kings 22:19; II Chron. 18:18).</p>
<p>[A PAVED WORK OF SAPPHIRE STONE.] Saadiah Gaon says that the <italic>sappir</italic> (sapphire) is white.<sup><xref rid="fn4434">22</xref></sup> He offers the phrase <italic>livnat ha-sappir</italic> as proof.<sup><xref rid="fn4435">23</xref></sup> However, this is not the case. The <italic>sappir</italic> comes in no color but red.<sup><xref rid="fn4436">24</xref></sup> The fact that it is the style of Scripture to repeat itself in different words proves this. Now it is written, <italic>Her princes were purer than snow, They were whiter than milk</italic> (Lam. 4:7). We thus see that Scripture repeats itself in different words. The verse continues, <italic>They were more ruddy in body than rubies, Their polishing was as of sapphire</italic> (sappir) (<italic>Ibid</italic>.). The term <italic>sappir</italic> thus has the same connotation as <italic>rubies</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4437">25</xref></sup> Furthermore, if <italic>livnat ha-sappir</italic> means like the whiteness of sapphire what reason is there for Scripture to say, <italic>like a work</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn4438">26</xref></sup> It should have read, like the appearance of.<sup><xref rid="fn4439">27</xref></sup> Actually, the word <italic>livnat</italic> is etymologically related to the word <italic>levanah</italic> (brick). It is like the word <italic>cheshkat</italic> (darkness of)<sup><xref rid="fn4440">28</xref></sup> in <italic>Darkness of waters</italic> (Ps. 18:12), which is etymologically related to the word <italic>chashekhah</italic> (darkness) (Gen. 15:12). Now the <italic>paved work of sapphire stone</italic> (livnat ha-sappir) was similar to the vision of the sapphire stone which had the form of a throne<sup><xref rid="fn4441">29</xref></sup> seen by Ezekiel in his prophetic vision (Ezek. 1:26; 10:1).</p>
<p>AND THE LIKE OF THE VERY HEAVEN FOR CLEARNESS. Its meaning is, beneath the paved work of sapphire stone there was the likeness of the very heaven. The latter refers to the ice-like firmament that was stretched over the heads of the beasts Ezekiel saw in his vision (Ezek. 1:22). Now our verse reads, <italic>and they saw the God of Israel</italic>. However, in Ezekiel Scripture reads, <italic>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel</italic> (Ezek. 10:20).<sup><xref rid="fn4442">30</xref></sup> Scripture was being brief.<sup><xref rid="fn4443">31</xref></sup> The creature was under the firmament, and the firmament was under the throne of glory. All of this was under God the revered.<sup><xref rid="fn4444">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND UPON THE NOBLES. The word <italic>atzile</italic> (nobles of) is similar to the word <italic>u-me&#x2019;atzilehah</italic> (from its nobles).<sup><xref rid="fn4445">33</xref></sup> The term elders<sup><xref rid="fn4446">34</xref></sup> is not used because the term nobles include Nadab and Abihu.<sup><xref rid="fn4447">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>[HE LAID NOT HIS HAND.] Its meaning is: that they saw God and did not die, as I will explain in my comments on the verse <italic>for man shall not see Me and live</italic> (Ex. 33:20).</p>
<p>[AND DID EAT AND DRINK.] They came down from the mountain happy.</p>
<p>AND DID EAT. The peaceofferings which their young people sacrificed.</p>
<p>AND DRINK. In happiness. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi says that the meaning of <italic>and did eat</italic> is, they had to eat even though they enjoyed the splendor of God&#x2019;s presence. Scripture mentions this because Moses lived for forty days and forty nights without eating and drinking, as is noted in the next section.<sup><xref rid="fn4448">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: COME UP TO ME INTO THE MOUNT. And be there until I give you [the tables of stone, and the law, etc.].<sup><xref rid="fn4449">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>A Spanish sage<sup><xref rid="fn4450">38</xref></sup> said that the first tablets which were the work of God,<sup><xref rid="fn4451">39</xref></sup> which means were finished by God, were created the same size as the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn4452">40</xref></sup> The second tablets also were</p>
<p>The work of God, who is the One who created everything.<sup><xref rid="fn4453">41</xref></sup> However, Moses finished the second tablets.<sup><xref rid="fn4454">42</xref></sup> A finished product is called a work. We thus read, <italic>va-yemaher la&#x2019;asot</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4455">43</xref></sup><italic>oto</italic> (and he hastened to dress it) (Gen. 18:7). The sage said this because Scripture reads, <italic>tables of stone</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4456">44</xref></sup> and does not employ the term <italic>stones</italic> as it does in reference to the second tablets.<sup><xref rid="fn4457">45</xref></sup> Now I pointed out to the above sage that Scripture states,<sup><xref rid="fn4458">46</xref></sup> <italic>When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone</italic> (avanim)<sup><xref rid="fn4459">47</xref></sup> (Deut. 9:9). Furthermore, Scripture there<sup><xref rid="fn4460">48</xref></sup> employs the phrase <italic>luchot avanim</italic> (tables of stone) three times.<sup><xref rid="fn4461">49</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>luchot even</italic> (tables of stone) therefore<sup><xref rid="fn4462">50</xref></sup> is tables made of stone and not of wood.<sup><xref rid="fn4463">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Gaon says that <italic>which I have written</italic> is connected to tablets of stone and not to <italic>the law and the commandment</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn4464">52</xref></sup> for God only wrote the Ten Statements.<sup><xref rid="fn4465">53</xref></sup> He explains that the meaning of <italic>the law</italic> is the written law and that of <italic>the commandment</italic> is the oral law, as all the commandments were given to Moses on Sinai during the days that Moses was on the mountain. It is similarly written, <italic>But as for thee, stand thou here by Me</italic> (Deut. 5:28).<sup><xref rid="fn4466">54</xref></sup> However, I believe that <italic>the law</italic> refers to the first and fifth statements of the Decalogue,<sup><xref rid="fn4467">55</xref></sup> and <italic>and the commandment</italic> refers to the other eight statements.<sup><xref rid="fn4468">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND MOSES ROSE UP. We may logically conclude that Joshua left the camp of Israel with Moses and stayed beneath the mountain until Moses came down. Observe, Joshua knew nothing about the making of the golden calf.<sup><xref rid="fn4469">57</xref></sup> There is no reason to ask, what did Joshua eat?<sup><xref rid="fn4470">58</xref></sup> Joshua gathered the manna which was around the camp and ate it daily.</p>
<p>14. AND UNTO THE ELDERS. The known elders, namely, the elders who saw God the revered.</p>
<p>AND, BEHOLD AARON. Aaron<sup><xref rid="fn4471">59</xref></sup> was also a first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn4472">60</xref></sup> It is possible that Hur was a first-born too and he was one of the seventy. Both of them were to judge in place of Moses until Moses came back. I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn4473">61</xref></sup> that Jethro only came in the second year.<sup><xref rid="fn4474">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND MOSES WENT UP&#x2026;AND THE CLOUD COVERED. The cloud had already covered the mountain on the sixth day of the month.<sup><xref rid="fn4475">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD ABODE. This means that the glory of God had already abode, for Scripture clearly states, <italic>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai</italic>. (Ex. 19:20).<sup><xref rid="fn4476">64</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>but Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was</italic> (Ex. 20:18).<sup><xref rid="fn4477">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THE CLOUD COVERED IT.<sup><xref rid="fn4478">66</xref></sup> The cloud covered Moses and no one was able to see him.</p>
<p>AND THE SEVENTH DAY HE CALLED UNTO MOSES. There is no reason for the Gaon&#x2019;s question, &#x201C;Why didn&#x2019;t Moses go up to the top of the mountain when he went up at first?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn4479">67</xref></sup> Moses was not able to go up<sup><xref rid="fn4480">68</xref></sup> without permission.<sup><xref rid="fn4481">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND THE APPEARANCE. Now the mountain was entirely covered by a cloud. God&#x2019;s glory was on top of the mountain. God the revered was seen there in the form of burning fire.</p>
<p>18. AND MOSES ENTERED&#x2026;AND WENT UP INTO THE MOUNT. Its meaning is, and Moses went up to the top of the mount where God&#x2019;s glory was.</p>
<p>AND MOSES WAS IN THE MOUNT. He did not come down. Scripture writes concerning these forty days, <italic>I did neither eat bread nor drink water</italic> (Deut. 9:9). This is a great wonder. There never was such a miracle before.</p>
<ftnote id="fn4413"><sup>1</sup> From Ex. 20:19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4414"><sup>2</sup> Ex. 23:33.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4415"><sup>3</sup> <italic>Aleh</italic> (come up) is in the second person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4416"><sup>4</sup> This is in the third person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4417"><sup>5</sup> In other words, why does Scripture switch from the second to the third person?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4418"><sup>6</sup> Not to be grammatically consistent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4419"><sup>7</sup> <italic>From the Lord</italic> is another way of saying from Him, as Scripture is referring to the Lord in the third person. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that Gen. 19:24 is grammatically consistent, for the entire verse is in the third person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4420"><sup>8</sup> To be consistent, Samuel should have employed a pronoun, for Samuel is the speaker. Thus I Sam. 12:11 is not grammatically consistent. We thus see that not all verses in Scripture are grammatically consistent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4421"><sup>9</sup> Ex. 20:18 tells us that Moses went up to Mount Sinai. Scripture never tells us that he came down. However, now God tells Moses to go up to Mount Sinai. Thus Moses, at some point after Ex. 23:33, must have come down from the mountain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4422"><sup>10</sup> For if we find God telling Moses to come up, it is obvious that Moses had previously come down from the mountain. According to I.E., Moses came down from the mountain after he received the Book of the Covenant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4423"><sup>11</sup> That is, all the commandments contained in the Book of the Covenant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4424"><sup>12</sup> The Torah portion <italic>Mishpatim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4425"><sup>13</sup> <italic>Va-ya&#x2019;an</italic> (answered) is in the singular. It literally means, and he answered. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4426"><sup>14</sup> Our verse is to be read as follows: and builded an altar under the mount, and builded twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4427"><sup>15</sup> Our texts have <italic>ha-bachurim</italic> (the chosen). <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 has <italic>ha-bekhorim</italic> (the first-born). See I.E. on verse 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4428"><sup>16</sup> Peace offerings were eaten by the celebrants. Since many celebrants (see previous note) partook of the offerings, oxen, which provide a substantial amount of meat, were sacrificed. Sheep and goats may also be brought as peaceofferings. However, they do not provide the same amount of meat as oxen. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4429"><sup>17</sup> According to I.E. our verse should be read as if written: and Moses took half the blood and put it in basins; and the other half he put in other basins and dashed the blood against the altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4430"><sup>18</sup> The half that had not been dashed on the altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4431"><sup>19</sup> It would have been impossible for Moses to sprinkle the blood upon all of the people. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4432"><sup>20</sup> Moses sprinkled the blood upon their garments (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4433"><sup>21</sup> It is clear from the context that Moses and those who accompanied him went up on Mount Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4434"><sup>22</sup> That is, sapphire stones have a white color.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4435"><sup>23</sup> According to Saadiah Gaon the word <italic>livnat</italic> (paved of) means whiteness of. Compare, <italic>lavan</italic> (white). Thus according to the Gaon the meaning of <italic>livnat ha-sappir</italic> is the whiteness of sapphire.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4436"><sup>24</sup> The usual color of sapphires is blue. However, white and yellow sapphires are also quite common. They never come naturally in red. I.E. either did not identify the <italic>sappir</italic> stone with sapphires, or he did not know what a sapphire was.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4437"><sup>25</sup> They both allude to the color red.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4438"><sup>26</sup> Scripture reads, <italic>ki-ma&#x2019;aseh livnat ha-sappir</italic>, which according to Saadiah Gaon means like a work of the whiteness of stone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4439"><sup>27</sup> The whiteness of sapphire. In other words, Scripture should have read, <italic>kimareh livnat ha-sappir</italic> rather than <italic>ki-ma&#x2019;aseh livnat ha-sappir</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4440"><sup>28</sup> Both words are in the construct and are similarly vocalized.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4441"><sup>29</sup> See Ezek. 10:1: <italic>Then I looked, and, behold, upon the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim, there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4442"><sup>30</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that in Ezekiel, God is described as sitting on a throne which was upon a platform held up by four beasts. However, here the throne and the creatures are omitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4443"><sup>31</sup> Here. In other words, we must transpose elements of Ezekiel&#x2019;s vision to complete the account of the vision described in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4444"><sup>32</sup> That Moses and the elders saw God sitting upon a throne. God&#x2019;s throne was upon an icy firmament held up by four creatures.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4445"><sup>33</sup> Translated according to I.E. See I.E. on Is. 41:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4446"><sup>34</sup> Verse 1 tells us that the elders accompanied Moses. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4447"><sup>35</sup> Who also accompanied Moses. Nadab and Abihu were nobles, not elders. See Rashi and Ramban.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4448"><sup>36</sup> Verse 18. Actually verse 18 only tells us that Moses was on Mount Sinai for 40 days. However, Deut. 9:9 tells us that Moses did not eat or drink during those forty days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4449"><sup>37</sup> In other words, we should interpret our verse as if the term &#x201C;until&#x201D; was in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4450"><sup>38</sup> I.E. does not identify him, nor can we.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4451"><sup>39</sup> Ex. 32:15 tells us that the tablets were <italic>the work of</italic> (ma&#x2019;aseh) <italic>God</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4452"><sup>40</sup> Which was their final form. According to this sage, <italic>work of God</italic> means put into their final form by God. For the size of the ark, see Ex. 25:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4453"><sup>41</sup> That is, He created both sets of tablets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4454"><sup>42</sup> See Ex. 34:1. Hence the second tablets are not referred to as God&#x2019;s work.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4455"><sup>43</sup> The word <italic>la&#x2019;assot</italic> come from the same root as the word <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh</italic> (work).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4456"><sup>44</sup> In our verse and in Ex. 31:18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4457"><sup>45</sup> Ex. 34:4. Scripture refers to the second tablets as <italic>luchot avanim</italic>, which literally means tables of stones. It refers to the first tablets as <italic>luchot even</italic> (tables of stone). The Spanish sage assumed that the phrase <italic>luchot even</italic> refers to a perfectly created stone, whereas <italic>luchot avanim</italic> refers to stones which require additional work (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4458"><sup>46</sup> With regard to the first tablets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4459"><sup>47</sup> Literally, stones.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4460"><sup>48</sup> In Deut. 9:9,10,12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4461"><sup>49</sup> All of which are in reference to the first tablets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4462"><sup>50</sup> That is, in view of the fact that Scripture refers to both tablets as <italic>luchot avanim</italic>, and the distinction that the sage made between them is untenable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4463"><sup>51</sup> It other words, it does not mean perfectly created stones.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4464"><sup>52</sup> Which immediately precedes <italic>which I have written</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4467"><sup>55</sup> The only two positive commandments in the Decalogue.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4468"><sup>56</sup> Which are negative commandments. Hence Scripture refers to them by two different terms. Thus the entire verse deals with the Decalogue. Furthermore, we can now connect <italic>which I have written</italic> to that which immediately precedes it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4469"><sup>57</sup> Hence he could not have been in the camp.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4470"><sup>58</sup> Since he was outside of the camp.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4471"><sup>59</sup> Aaron, like the 70 elders, was a first-born. See I.E.&#x2019;s comment on verse 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4472"><sup>60</sup> This contradicts the Rabbinic opinion that Miriam was the eldest (<italic>Shemot Rabba</italic> 1:13). See Krinsky and Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4473"><sup>61</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 18:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4474"><sup>62</sup> In other words, this occurred before Moses appointed judges over Israel. If judges had been appointed over Israel, Moses would not have found it necessary to appoint Aaron and Hur as judges in his place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4475"><sup>63</sup> The cloud did not now cover the mountain. It covered the mountain on the sixth day of the third month, the day that God revealed the Decalogue. Moses ascended the mountain seven days later. <italic>Va-yekhas</italic> (covered) is to be taken as a pluperfect, meaning: had already covered.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4476"><sup>64</sup> Which shows that God&#x2019;s glory was previously on the mountain. According to I.E., <italic>va-yishkon</italic> (abode) is a pluperfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4477"><sup>65</sup> Also this verse shows that God&#x2019;s glory was previously on the mountain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4478"><sup>66</sup> Literally, and the cloud covered him. There is no neutral form in Hebrew. Thus &#x201C;him&#x201D; can refer either to the mountain or to Moses. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4479"><sup>67</sup> Verse 13 tells us that Moses went up the mountain. Our verse tells us that God called unto Moses to come up, i.e., to come up to the top (see I.E. on verse 18).

[THAT THEY TAKE FOR ME.] The words <italic>ve-yikchu li</italic> (that they take for Me)<sup><xref rid="fn4484">3</xref></sup> is similar to the form <italic>surah elai</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4485">4</xref></sup> (turn in to me) (Jud. 4:18). <italic>Surah elai</italic> means turn from your place and come to me.<sup><xref rid="fn4486">5</xref></sup> <italic>Ve-yikchu li</italic> has a similar connotation. It means let him<sup><xref rid="fn4487">6</xref></sup> take from what he owns and give it to me.<sup><xref rid="fn4488">7</xref></sup> The same is true of <italic>Fetch me</italic> (kechi li), <italic>I pray thee, a little water</italic> (I Kings 17:10).<sup><xref rid="fn4489">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND THIS IS THE OFFERING. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that we do not find silver mentioned in connection with the tabernacle except for the silver of those who were counted.<sup><xref rid="fn4490">9</xref></sup> This being the case, how could Scripture state that the silver was an offering?<sup><xref rid="fn4491">10</xref></sup> The Gaon answers that other silver was donated for use in the construction of a silver table,<sup><xref rid="fn4492">11</xref></sup> since it is highly unlikely that there was no table for preparing things,<sup><xref rid="fn4493">12</xref></sup> for cutting, for washing, or for the trumpets and basins.<sup><xref rid="fn4494">13</xref></sup> However, I believe that there is no need for the Gaon&#x2019;s interpretation. Scripture did not bother to exclude one of the sixteen materials,<sup><xref rid="fn4495">14</xref></sup> as fifteen were donated.<sup><xref rid="fn4496">15</xref></sup> It is the same with <italic>These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddanaram</italic> (Gen. 35:26).<sup><xref rid="fn4497">16</xref></sup> However, Benjamin was born in the land of Canaan. He was not born elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="fn4498">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture states, <italic>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons</italic> (Deut. 10:22). However, the sons of Joseph did not go down to Egypt, for they were born in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn4499">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture begins with a precious gift, namely, gold. It concludes with a precious gift, onyx stones, and stones to be set,<sup><xref rid="fn4500">19</xref></sup> which only the princes possessed. However, this was not the case with gold, as most of the people had gold. Now, no iron was used in the construction of the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn4501">20</xref></sup> Scripture tells us regarding the first temple, <italic>and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building</italic> (I Kings 6:7).<sup><xref rid="fn4502">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND BLUE. Yefet<sup><xref rid="fn4503">22</xref></sup> says that <italic>tekhelet</italic> (blue) is a blacklike color. Black is the final<sup><xref rid="fn4504">23</xref></sup> color, as all colors turn black,<sup><xref rid="fn4505">24</xref></sup> and no human hands can change black.<sup><xref rid="fn4506">25</xref></sup> However, we will rely on the sages of the Talmud who said that <italic>tekhelet</italic> is green wool.<sup><xref rid="fn4507">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND PURPLE. <italic>Argaman</italic> (purple) is a red-like color. It is referred to as <italic>argevan</italic> in the Book of Chronicles (II Chron. 2:6) and as <italic>arju&#x2019;an</italic> in Arabic. This color is only found in wool or silk.<sup><xref rid="fn4508">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SCARLET. However, Scripture elsewhere reads, <italic>sheni ha-tola&#x2019;at</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4509">28</xref></sup> (and the scarlet) (Lev. 14:6). We find the same with <italic>mi-tzur ha-challamish</italic> (out of the rock of flint) (Deut. 8:15) and <italic>chelmish tzur</italic> (out of the flinty rock) (Deut. 32:13). Saadiah Gaon rendered <italic>tola&#x2019;at shani</italic> as <italic>krimez</italic> (red).<sup><xref rid="fn4510">29</xref></sup> Although <italic>tola&#x2019;at shani</italic> is also red, it is not the same color that <italic>argaman</italic> is.<sup><xref rid="fn4511">30</xref></sup> Many people identify <italic>tola&#x2019;at shani</italic> with silk<sup><xref rid="fn4512">31</xref></sup> because of the word <italic>tola&#x2019;at</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4513">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND FINE LINEN. <italic>Shesh</italic> refers to linen, which is a type of flax that is found only in Egypt. It comes only in white and is not dyed. We thus read, <italic>Of fine linen</italic> (shesh) <italic>and richly woven work</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4514">33</xref></sup><italic> from Egypt</italic> (Ezek. 27:7).<sup><xref rid="fn4515">34</xref></sup> The Gaon translated <italic>shesh</italic> as <italic>osher</italic> in Arabic. This material is in existence until this very day.</p>
<p>AND GOATS&#x2019; HAIR. <italic>Izzim</italic> is to be rendered as goats&#x2019; hair.<sup><xref rid="fn4516">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND RAMS&#x2019; SKINS. Skins from large rams. Such skins are prepared in the land of Al Gudmas<sup><xref rid="fn4517">36</xref></sup> and are referred to as <italic>gudmasi</italic>.</p>
<p>AND SEALSKINS. <italic>Techashim</italic> (seals) refers to a type of animal that was known then,<sup><xref rid="fn4518">37</xref></sup> as it is written, <italic>va-ena&#x2019;alekh tachash</italic> (and shod thee with sealskin) (Ezek. 27:7). It is thus clear that it was already known.<sup><xref rid="fn4519">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND ACACIA-WOOD. Some of our ancient sages said<sup><xref rid="fn4520">39</xref></sup> that the patriarch Jacob planted acacia trees in Egypt, and Israel, upon the command of Moses, brought them out. <italic>And every man, with whom was found</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4521">40</xref></sup> <italic>acacia-wood&#x2026;brought it</italic> (Ex. 35:24) is proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn4522">41</xref></sup> They possessed acacia as they possessed the blue and the purple.<sup><xref rid="fn4523">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, one wonders, why does Scripture say, <italic>with whom was found</italic>, which means it was used for personal needs.<sup><xref rid="fn4524">43</xref></sup> Now, if we so interpret it,<sup><xref rid="fn4525">44</xref></sup> then we must ask, why did the Israelites take acacia wood out of Egypt? What need did they have for acacia wood?<sup><xref rid="fn4526">45</xref></sup> Furthermore, it is clear that the Egyptians thought that the Israelites were going to offer sacrifices and then return to Egypt. That is why the Egyptians lent the Israelites [gold and silver jewels plus raiment].<sup><xref rid="fn4527">46</xref></sup> How could the Israelites take out many boards, each one of which was ten cubits?<sup><xref rid="fn4528">47</xref></sup> The boards were also accompanied by bars.<sup><xref rid="fn4529">48</xref></sup> In Egypt they passed by the seat of the king. What was their answer to those who asked them why they were carrying acacia wood when they were going on a three-day journey to offer sacrifices?</p>
<p>Now we do not know whether our ancestors had a tradition that the Israelites took the acacia wood out of Egypt. If they did, then we will accept their tradition. However, if their statement is based on reasoning, then we must seek another explanation. We suggest that there was a forest of acacia trees next to Mount Sinai. When Israel came to Sinai, Moses told them that they would be spending a long time there. I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn4530">49</xref></sup> that there was no cloud over them at this time.<sup><xref rid="fn4531">50</xref></sup> Each one of them then made a booth. The princes made court-like structures, each one in accordance with his status. They cut the entire forest down, for they were a large nation. They made booths.<sup><xref rid="fn4532">51</xref></sup> Moses did not speak to them regarding the tabernacle until after the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn4533">52</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>with whom was found</italic> (Ex. 35:24).<sup><xref rid="fn4534">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. OIL FOR THE LIGHT. Oil needed for the light in accordance with the requirements of the law.<sup><xref rid="fn4535">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>The wise men of this generation say that <italic>ve-liktoret ha-sammim</italic> (and for the sweet incense)<sup><xref rid="fn4536">55</xref></sup> has to be inverted in order to be understood.<sup><xref rid="fn4537">56</xref></sup> Its meaning is, and the perfumes for the incense.<sup><xref rid="fn4538">57</xref></sup> Now if this is the case, then why didn&#x2019;t Scripture say, for the anointing oil spices (<italic>ve-le-shemen ha-mischah besamim</italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn4539">58</xref></sup> Furthermore, Scripture reads, <italic>and the spice, and the oil, for the light</italic> (ve&#x2019;et ha-shamen le-ma&#x2019;or), <italic>and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense</italic> (ve-liktoret hasammim)<sup><xref rid="fn4540">59</xref></sup> (Ex. 35:28).<sup><xref rid="fn4541">60</xref></sup> I believe that the word <italic>spices</italic> (besamim)<sup><xref rid="fn4542">61</xref></sup> takes in the spices needed for anointing oil and the spices that were mixed with the incense perfumes.<sup><xref rid="fn4543">62</xref></sup> This is also the true tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn4544">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. ONYX STONES. This includes all the stones of the ephod and the one of the breastplate.<sup><xref rid="fn4545">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO BE SET. I will explain later the meaning of <italic>me-lu&#x2019;im</italic> (to be set).<sup><xref rid="fn4546">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY. The tabemacle is called a <italic>mikdash</italic> (a sanctuary)<sup><xref rid="fn4547">66</xref></sup> because it is the tabernacle<sup><xref rid="fn4548">67</xref></sup> of God the holy.<sup><xref rid="fn4549">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. I SHOW THEE. You will see it with your eye. Unlike the visions of Ezekiel,<sup><xref rid="fn4550">69</xref></sup> which were in prophetic dreams. Scripture adds the emphatic <italic>heh</italic> and reads <italic>ha-mishkan</italic> (the tabernacle) after it mentions the term sanctuary.<sup><xref rid="fn4551">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>[EVEN SO SHALL YE MAKE IT.] A <italic>vav</italic> is placed in front of the word <italic>ken</italic> (even so) in the phrase <italic>ve-khen ta&#x2019;asu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4552">71</xref></sup> (even so shall ye make it)<sup><xref rid="fn4553">72</xref></sup> regarding the vessels, for Scripture earlier states, <italic>ve-asu li mikdash</italic> (And let them make Me a sanctuary) (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn4554">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND THEY SHALL MAKE. Scripture begins by saying, <italic>And they shall make an ark</italic> because it had at first said, <italic>And let them make Me a sanctuary</italic> (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn4555">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>[TWO CUBITS AND A HALF SHALL BE THE LENGTH THEREOF, AND A CUBIT AND A HALF THE BREADTH THEREOF, AND A CUBIT AND A HALF THE HEIGHT THEREOF.] We do not know if these measurements refer to the outside or to the inside of the ark. Now if the reference is to the outside of the ark,<sup><xref rid="fn4556">75</xref></sup> then the width of the two sides of the ark,<sup><xref rid="fn4557">76</xref></sup> each of which was covered by gold on the inside and the outside, added up to half a cubit,<sup><xref rid="fn4558">77</xref></sup> making the size of the tablets a cubit in width and a cubit in length.<sup><xref rid="fn4559">78</xref></sup> Now if we say that the height of the ark<sup><xref rid="fn4560">79</xref></sup> was also half a cubit thick, then each tablet was extremely heavy.<sup><xref rid="fn4561">80</xref></sup> Perhaps<sup><xref rid="fn4562">81</xref></sup> God gave strength to the hands of Moses, which were &#x201C;heavy&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn4563">82</xref></sup> to begin with, so that he was able to bring down a tablet of stone in one hand.<sup><xref rid="fn4564">83</xref></sup> Now Scripture states, <italic>tables that were written on both their sides</italic> (Ex. 32:15).<sup><xref rid="fn4565">84</xref></sup> Perhaps it was so,<sup><xref rid="fn4566">85</xref></sup> for a tablet is a cube having six sides.<sup><xref rid="fn4567">86</xref></sup> We similarly find it written<sup><xref rid="fn4568">87</xref></sup> that there were three arks.<sup><xref rid="fn4569">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>Its weight raises questions.<sup><xref rid="fn4570">89</xref></sup> Furthermore, the width of the ark cover<sup><xref rid="fn4571">90</xref></sup> was a handbreadth<sup><xref rid="fn4572">91</xref></sup> Additionally, we read in Scripture that the gold which was donated<sup><xref rid="fn4573">92</xref></sup> came to less than one thousand and four hundred parts of the gold which king David left.<sup><xref rid="fn4574">93</xref></sup> Observe, the cherubim were made of olive wood.<sup><xref rid="fn4575">94</xref></sup> The incense altar was also not completely made of gold.<sup><xref rid="fn4576">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>If we look at it logically, then it appears that the ark was covered with gold for appearance sake<sup><xref rid="fn4577">96</xref></sup> and that very little gold actually went into the covering.<sup><xref rid="fn4578">97</xref></sup> Were not the boards, the bars, the table, and the incense altar all covered with gold? Nothing except for the menorah was made entirely of gold. Now once they made an ark out of gold, what need was there for wood?<sup><xref rid="fn4579">98</xref></sup> The fact that Solomon covered the porch and the house with gold demonstrates how the covering was actually done.<sup><xref rid="fn4580">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. A CROWN OF GOLD. The word <italic>zer</italic> (crown) comes from the same root as the word <italic>zareta</italic> (you crowned) in, <italic>You crowned my going about and my lying down</italic> (Ps. 139:3).<sup><xref rid="fn4581">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. THE FOUR FEET THEREOF. I searched all of Scripture and did not find the word <italic>pa&#x2019;am</italic> (foot) used in the sense of corner.<sup><xref rid="fn4582">101</xref></sup> It is always employed in the sense of a foot. We thus read: <italic>Even the feet of the poor, and the steps</italic> (pa&#x2019;ame) <italic>of the needy</italic> (Is. 26:6); <italic>And shall make His footsteps</italic> (pe&#x2019;amav) <italic>a way</italic> (Ps. 85:14); <italic>How beautiful are thy steps</italic> (fe&#x2019;amayikh) (Cant. 7:2). There are many other instances.</p>
<p>I was therefore forced to explain that the ark had feet,<sup><xref rid="fn4583">102</xref></sup> for it would be disrespectful for the ark to sit on the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn4584">103</xref></sup> Furthermore, what reason is there for Scripture to place a connective <italic>vav</italic> before the word <italic>u-shete</italic> (and two) when dealing with the two rings of gold (v. 12)? If the reference was to the rings already mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn4585">104</xref></sup> then Scripture should have read, <italic>shete taba&#x2019;ot</italic> (two rings), as that is the proper syntax if the Torah wants to indicate that it is dealing with the four gold rings previously noted.<sup><xref rid="fn4586">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the wise men of our generation understood this.<sup><xref rid="fn4587">106</xref></sup> He says that the staves were placed in the ark in the rings that were on its feet. He further says that they would remove the staves from the lower rings and place them in the upper rings when it was necessary to carry the ark. It is similarly written, <italic>and shall set the staves thereof</italic> (Num. 4:6).<sup><xref rid="fn4588">107</xref></sup> However, I believe that the staves were never removed once they were placed in the upper rings, for Scripture states, <italic>they shall not be taken from it</italic> (v. 15). As to <italic>And shall set the staves thereof</italic> (Num. 4:6), it means that the priests shall place the staves upon the shoulders of the Kohathites.<sup><xref rid="fn4589">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the ark was placed in the Holy of Holies<sup><xref rid="fn4590">109</xref></sup> it was necessary to place it near the wall<sup><xref rid="fn4591">110</xref></sup> so that the cherubim<sup><xref rid="fn4592">111</xref></sup> would cover the ark and its staves.<sup><xref rid="fn4593">112</xref></sup> The end of each one of the staves therefore<sup><xref rid="fn4594">113</xref></sup> extended.<sup><xref rid="fn4595">114</xref></sup> This is what Scripture refers to when it states, <italic>And the staves were so long</italic> (I Kings 8:8).<sup><xref rid="fn4596">115</xref></sup> The four lower rings<sup><xref rid="fn4597">116</xref></sup> thus<sup><xref rid="fn4598">117</xref></sup> served, as is the case with chests,<sup><xref rid="fn4599">118</xref></sup> for beauty and elegance.<sup><xref rid="fn4600">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. IN THE RINGS OF THE ARK. In the rings that are on the sides of the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn4601">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THOU SHALT PUT. The tablets and the testimony<sup><xref rid="fn4602">121</xref></sup> are one and the same.<sup><xref rid="fn4603">122</xref></sup> They were, as it were, a marriage contract.<sup><xref rid="fn4604">123</xref></sup> They were the tablets of testimony.<sup><xref rid="fn4605">124</xref></sup> <italic>And he took and put the testimony into the ark</italic> (Ex. 40:20) is perfect proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn4606">125</xref></sup> Furthermore, Moses did not write the scroll of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn4607">126</xref></sup> The scroll of the Torah was placed by the priests next to the outer side of the ark of the covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn4608">127</xref></sup> It is additionally written, <italic>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone</italic> (I Kings 8:9). There is a difference of opinion concerning this.<sup><xref rid="fn4609">128</xref></sup></p>
<p>One may raise the following question. Scripture reports that God told Moses (v. 16), <italic>And thou shalt put into the ark the tables</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4610">129</xref></sup> <italic>which I shall give thee</italic>. The Torah then tells us, <italic>And He gave unto Moses, when He had made an end of speaking with him&#x2026;the two tables of the testimony</italic> (Ex. 31:18). Now Moses broke these tablets. Moses thus did not fulfill the command of God.<sup><xref rid="fn4611">130</xref></sup> It is possible to give the following answer. Perhaps this is the reason why our sages said that the broken tablets were placed in the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn4612">131</xref></sup> Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn4613">132</xref></sup> does not contradict their words, for both the first and the second tablets were tablets of the covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn4614">133</xref></sup> It is also possible to answer that Scripture (v. 16) speaks only about the second tablets. The statement <italic>which I shall give thee</italic> does not contradict this.<sup><xref rid="fn4615">134</xref></sup> For Scripture also says concerning the second tablets, <italic>And the Lord gave them unto me</italic> (Deut. 10:4). Furthermore, note that we do not find that God told Moses that he should make an ark and place the first set of tablets there. For God knew that Moses would break them.<sup><xref rid="fn4616">135</xref></sup> It was only concerning the tablets that Moses hewed<sup><xref rid="fn4617">136</xref></sup> that God said, <italic>and make thee an ark of wood</italic> (Deut. 10:1).</p>
<p>Now our sages said that <italic>and make thee an ark of wood</italic> does not refer to the ark made by Bezalel.<sup><xref rid="fn4618">137</xref></sup> This is correct. However, if we follow the plain meaning of the text, then it does not appear to me to be far-fetched to interpret the text<sup><xref rid="fn4619">138</xref></sup> as referring to the ark which Bezalel constructed. Scripture similarly reads, <italic>And they shall make an ark of acacia-wood</italic> (v. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn4620">139</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no reason to ask, where were these tablets placed before the tabernacle was constructed?<sup><xref rid="fn4621">140</xref></sup> For there is no need to mention this.<sup><xref rid="fn4622">141</xref></sup> What forced me to offer this explanation<sup><xref rid="fn4623">142</xref></sup> was the fact that Moses says, <italic>and</italic> [I] <italic>put the tables in the ark which I had made</italic> (Deut. 10:5). Now if we assume that Moses relates the account as it happened,<sup><xref rid="fn4624">143</xref></sup> even though we do not know the reason why he should mention this,<sup><xref rid="fn4625">144</xref></sup> what shall we do with what follows, namely, <italic>as the Lord commanded me</italic> (Deut. 10:5).<sup><xref rid="fn4626">145</xref></sup> This is proof that Scripture speaks of the tablets which Moses placed in the ark of the covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn4627">146</xref></sup> [Moses tells us that] these tablets are there<sup><xref rid="fn4628">147</xref></sup> until this very day (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).<sup><xref rid="fn4629">148</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>and there they are unto this very day</italic> (I Kings 8:8).<sup><xref rid="fn4630">149</xref></sup></p>
<p>This<sup><xref rid="fn4631">150</xref></sup> is also a sign and a witness that there was no Torah scroll in the ark, for Moses first put the tablets in the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn4632">151</xref></sup> He then placed the ark cover with the cherubim over the ark. Now God&#x2019;s glory dwelled upon the cherubim. Scripture explicitly reads, <italic>Thou art enthroned upon the cherubim</italic> (Ps. 80:2). This being the case, how could Moses place a Torah scroll inside the ark in the fortieth year without first removing the ark cover with the cherubim from on top of the ark?<sup><xref rid="fn4633">152</xref></sup> There is no need for all of this.<sup><xref rid="fn4634">153</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND THOU SHALT MAKE AN ARK-COVER. The word <italic>kapporet</italic> means a cover. Yefet says that the word <italic>le-khapper</italic> (to make atonement) in <italic>to make atonement for him</italic> (Lev. 1:4) is similar. Its meaning is similar to <italic>whose sin is covered</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4635">154</xref></sup> (Ps. 32:1).<sup><xref rid="fn4636">155</xref></sup> However, I believe that the word <italic>le-khapper</italic> (<italic>to make atonement for him</italic>) (Lev. 1:4) is similar in meaning to the form <italic>kofer</italic> (ransom). Now this is clearly stated,<sup><xref rid="fn4637">156</xref></sup> for Scripture states, <italic>then shall they give every man a ransom</italic> (kofer) <italic>for his soul unto the Lord</italic> (Ex. 30:12). Scripture then goes on to say, <italic>le-khapper al nafshotekhem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4638">157</xref></sup> (to make atonement for your souls) (Ex. 30:15).<sup><xref rid="fn4639">158</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture does not mention the thickness of the ark cover.<sup><xref rid="fn4640">159</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND THOU SHALT MAKE TWO CHERUBIM. Our sages said that the <italic>cherubim</italic> looked like two youths. They said that the <italic>kaf</italic> in <italic>keruvim</italic> is a preposition and the word <italic>keruvim</italic> (cherubim) means the same as the Aramaic word <italic>ke-ravia</italic> (like youths).<sup><xref rid="fn4641">160</xref></sup> Now if they had a tradition that the cherubim were youth-like images, then what they said was true. They interpreted the word in a manner that would recall the tradition.<sup><xref rid="fn4642">161</xref></sup> They did the same with the word <italic>chanukkah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4643">162</xref></sup> The <italic>kaf</italic> in the word <italic>keruv</italic> (cherub) is a root letter,<sup><xref rid="fn4644">163</xref></sup> as the word <italic>hakeruvim</italic> (the cherubim) in <italic>And the cherubim shall</italic> (v. 20) proves.<sup><xref rid="fn4645">164</xref></sup> The <italic>heh</italic> of <italic>ha-keruvim</italic> indicates the definite article. It is not an interrogative <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4646">165</xref></sup> like the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>ha-kemakkat</italic> (or is he slain) in <italic>Or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by Him</italic> (Is. 27:7).<sup><xref rid="fn4647">166</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now when I searched for the meaning of the word <italic>keruvim</italic> (cherubim) I found that it refers to various forms. Compare, <italic>Thou wast the far-covering cherub</italic> (keruv) (Ezek. 28:14).<sup><xref rid="fn4648">167</xref></sup> Ezekiel said that each one of the beasts which he beheld<sup><xref rid="fn4649">168</xref></sup> had four faces (Ezek. 1:6). One of these faces was the face of an ox (Ezek. 1:10). However, elsewhere he describes this very creature as having the face of a cherub in place of the face of an ox (Ezek. 10:14). Its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn4650">169</xref></sup> is that the creature had the image that Ezekiel had mentioned earlier.<sup><xref rid="fn4651">170</xref></sup> At the end Ezekiel says, <italic>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim</italic> (Ezek. 10:20). Ezekiel thus called the four creatures cherubim. The <italic>kaf</italic> in the word <italic>keruvim</italic> thus is a root letter.</p>
<p>OF BEATEN WORK. <italic>Mikshah</italic> (of beaten work) means equal. The word <italic>mikshah</italic> (the same size) in <italic>And instead of hair trimmed to the same size</italic> (ma&#x2019;aseh mikshah) <italic>baldness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4652">171</xref></sup> (Is. 3:24)is similar. <italic>Ma&#x2019;aseh</italic> (trimmed)<sup><xref rid="fn4653">172</xref></sup> has the same meaning as <italic>asah</italic> (trimmed) in <italic>nor trimmed his beard</italic> (II Sam. 19:25).<sup><xref rid="fn4654">173</xref></sup> Its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn4655">174</xref></sup> is that each cherub was equally distant from the edge of the ark cover.</p>
<p>19. CHERUB. Observe&#x0021; The cherubs were positioned<sup><xref rid="fn4656">175</xref></sup> on the long side of the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn4657">176</xref></sup> The staves were therefore placed to the width of the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn4658">177</xref></sup> There is someone who disagrees and says that <italic>side</italic> refers only to the long side.<sup><xref rid="fn4659">178</xref></sup> He offers proof from <italic>and for the second side of the tabernacle</italic> (Ex. 26:20).<sup><xref rid="fn4660">179</xref></sup> However, <italic>and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle</italic> (Ex. 26:27), which is right next to the verse that he quotes, destroys his proof.<sup><xref rid="fn4661">180</xref></sup></p>
<p>The cherubim which were upon the two edges of the ark were made out of the ark cover itself</p>
<p>20. AND THE CHERUBIM SHALL. Yefet says that the meaning of <italic>toward the ark-cover shall the faces of the cherubim be</italic> means that the cherubim shall face the center of the ark cover. However, I believe that the faces of the cherubim did not stand erect,<sup><xref rid="fn4662">181</xref></sup> but rather inclined a bit towards the ark cover.<sup><xref rid="fn4663">182</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND IN THE ARK. This is in keeping with Hebrew syntax.<sup><xref rid="fn4664">183</xref></sup> Moses had already put the testimonies into the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn4665">184</xref></sup> He was told: afterwards<sup><xref rid="fn4666">185</xref></sup> place the ark cover [over the ark].<sup><xref rid="fn4667">186</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND THERE I WILL MEET WITH THEE. I do not understand in what way this verse contradicts <italic>And the Lord called unto Moses, and spoke unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying</italic> (Lev. 1:1).<sup><xref rid="fn4668">187</xref></sup> For the phrase <italic>tent of meeting</italic> takes in the tabernacle and everything in it.<sup><xref rid="fn4669">188</xref></sup> There is no need for a clarifying<sup><xref rid="fn4670">189</xref></sup> verse.<sup><xref rid="fn4671">190</xref></sup></p>
<p>[OF ALL THINGS WHICH I WILL GIVE THEE IN COMMANDMENT UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] The word et<sup><xref rid="fn4672">191</xref></sup> in <italic>and</italic> (ve-et) <italic>of all things which I will give thee in commandment</italic> has a <italic>vav</italic> placed before it<sup><xref rid="fn4673">192</xref></sup> for the following reason.<sup><xref rid="fn4674">193</xref></sup> The word <italic>ve-dibbarti</italic> (and I will speak) is to be read as if written twice.<sup><xref rid="fn4675">194</xref></sup> Our verse is to be read as if written: and I will speak with thee from above the ark cover, from between the two cherubim. Scripture does not mention what will be spoken.<sup><xref rid="fn4676">195</xref></sup> Its meaning is, I will speak with you in order to inform you of My secret and to answer your questions.<sup><xref rid="fn4677">196</xref></sup> And I will speak to you of all the things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn4678">197</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have reason to ask, why did God mention the ark first<sup><xref rid="fn4679">198</xref></sup> when Scripture reads, <italic>the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof</italic> (v. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn4680">199</xref></sup> The answer is that it is linguistic style to explain the last item with which one has closed.<sup><xref rid="fn4681">200</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau; and I gave unto Esau mount Seir</italic> (Josh. 24:4).<sup><xref rid="fn4682">201</xref></sup> God therefore began with an explanation of the tabernacle&#x2019;s furniture.<sup><xref rid="fn4683">202</xref></sup> God started with the most important piece of furniture<sup><xref rid="fn4684">203</xref></sup> and then went on to the explain the table and the menorah. After this, God said, <italic>Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle</italic> (Ex. 26:1).</p>
<p>Now when Moses gathered the congregation he spoke to them about the tabernacle and the tent first.<sup><xref rid="fn4685">204</xref></sup> Then he told them about the ark.</p>
<p>There was no need for anyone to teach Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn4686">205</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is reason to wonder why God didn&#x2019;t mention the altar of incense.<sup><xref rid="fn4687">206</xref></sup> The answer by way of parable is:<sup><xref rid="fn4688">207</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s glory did not depart [from the tabernacle].<sup><xref rid="fn4689">208</xref></sup> The ark was therefore in the form of a throne.<sup><xref rid="fn4690">209</xref></sup> Observe, a menorah and a prepared table [were placed in the sanctuary].<sup><xref rid="fn4691">210</xref></sup> God did not mention the altar of incense until He first mentioned the altar of the burnt offering, because God wanted to issue the command, <italic>You shall offer no&#x2026;burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon</italic> (Ex. 30:9).<sup><xref rid="fn4692">211</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses mentioned the incense altar to the children of Israel following the menorah.<sup><xref rid="fn4693">212</xref></sup> The incense altar was similarly constructed after the menorah.<sup><xref rid="fn4694">213</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND THOU SHALT MAKE. There is no doubt that the dimensions mentioned in our verse refer to the thickness of the table<sup><xref rid="fn4695">214</xref></sup> plus the height of its legs.<sup><xref rid="fn4696">215</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THOU SHALT MAKE. The border was on top<sup><xref rid="fn4697">216</xref></sup> as is the case with tables.</p>
<p>AND THOU SHALT MAKE A GOLDEN CROWN. Scripture now explains that the crown which was mentioned earlier should be around the borders.</p>
<p>26. AND THOU SHALT MAKE&#x2026;FOUR RINGS&#x2026;AND PUT THE RINGS IN THE FOUR CORNERS. East, west, north, and south.<sup><xref rid="fn4698">217</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. CLOSE BY THE BORDER. Scripture mentions the place where the rings were to be placed.</p>
<p>28. THAT THE TABLE MAY BE BORNE WITH THEM. <italic>Venissa</italic> (may be borne) is a <italic>nifal. Ve-nissa</italic> is similar to <italic>ve-nikkah</italic> (be quit) in <italic>then shall he that smote him be quit</italic> (Ex. 21:19). For <italic>nissa</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4699">218</xref></sup> and <italic>nikkah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4700">219</xref></sup> have a <italic>dagesh</italic> in them to make up for the dropped first root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn4701">220</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND THOU SHALT MAKE. What the rabbis said is known.<sup><xref rid="fn4702">221</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHEREWITH TO POUR OUT.] The phrase <italic>wherewith to pour out</italic> refers to <italic>the jars thereof</italic> (kesotav).<sup><xref rid="fn4703">222</xref></sup> It does not relate to <italic>and the bowls thereof</italic>, which immediately precedes it.<sup><xref rid="fn4704">223</xref></sup> The following is similar: <italic>Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among them</italic> (Ps. 99:6). Scripture then goes on to say, <italic>He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud</italic> (Ps. 99:7). The latter refers to Moses and Aaron, not to Samuel.<sup><xref rid="fn4705">224</xref></sup> The fact that Scripture says with regard to the making of the vessels, <italic>the jars thereof</italic> (ha-kesot) <italic>wherewith to pour out</italic> (Ex. 37:16) proves that <italic>wherewith to pour out</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4706">225</xref></sup> refers to <italic>the jars thereof</italic>. So does <italic>and the jars</italic> (kesot) <italic>wherewith to pour out</italic> (Num. 4:7).</p>
<p>The word <italic>nasakh</italic> (pour) has many meanings. We thus read, <italic>They shall not pour out wine-offerings</italic> (nesekh) <italic>to the Lord</italic> (Hos. 9:4);<sup><xref rid="fn4707">226</xref></sup> <italic>The image perchance, which the craftsman hath melted</italic> (nasakh) (Is. 40:19); and <italic>Truly it is I that have established</italic> (nasakhti) <italic>My king</italic> (Ps. 2:6).<sup><xref rid="fn4708">227</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Nathan,<sup><xref rid="fn4709">228</xref></sup> the author of the <italic>Arukh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn4710">229</xref></sup> says that <italic>kesavot</italic> (jars) are rods,<sup><xref rid="fn4711">230</xref></sup> as that is how they are referred to in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn4712">231</xref></sup> However, the one who told this to him did not know the Arabic language and spoke it laughably. Rods in Arabic are referred to as <italic>katzab</italic>, which is spelled with a <italic>tzadi</italic> and a <italic>bet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4713">232</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is an error<sup><xref rid="fn4714">233</xref></sup> in the Book of Chronicles.<sup><xref rid="fn4715">234</xref></sup> Chronicles mentions basins in place of dishes, bowls in place of pans. It mentions jars as Scripture does here. In place of the bowls it mentions forks.<sup><xref rid="fn4716">235</xref></sup> They were all made of gold for use at the table. It is possible that David commanded that other utensils be placed upon the tables which Solomon would make.<sup><xref rid="fn4717">236</xref></sup> However, the table placed in the tabernacle differed.<sup><xref rid="fn4718">237</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. AND THOU SHALT SET UP UPON THE TABLE SHOWBREAD. According to the plain meaning of the text, the bread was called <italic>showbread</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4719">238</xref></sup> because of the explanation which follows it.<sup><xref rid="fn4720">239</xref></sup> That which the sages said is also true,<sup><xref rid="fn4721">240</xref></sup> as the <italic>ka&#x2019;arot</italic> (dishes) were molds.<sup><xref rid="fn4722">241</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND THOU SHALT MAKE A CANDLESTICK. I have seen copies of Scripture which the wise men of Tiberias have examined. Behold, I found the word <italic>te&#x2019;aseh</italic> (be made) spelled with a <italic>yod</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4723">242</xref></sup> Fifteen of their wise men<sup><xref rid="fn4724">243</xref></sup> swore that they checked every word, vowel, full and deficient spelling, three times. I did not find this to be the case with the books of Scripture in Spain, France, and on the other side of the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn4725">244</xref></sup> Our sages said that the additional <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>te&#x2019;aseh</italic> alludes to the ten<sup><xref rid="fn4726">245</xref></sup> candlesticks which Solomon would make. Let me generalize. If there is a <italic>yod</italic> in <italic>te&#x2019;aseh</italic>, then <italic>te&#x2019;aseh</italic> is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn4727">246</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Midrash tells us that the menorah made itself.<sup><xref rid="fn4728">247</xref></sup> The meaning of this midrash is that all who saw the menorah marveled and asked, &#x201C;How could a human being make it?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn4729">248</xref></sup> Look&#x0021; Scripture states, <italic>and he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4730">249</xref></sup> <italic>made candlesticks</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4731">250</xref></sup> and <italic>so he made the candlestick</italic> (Num. 8:4).<sup><xref rid="fn4732">251</xref></sup> Behold, Scripture writes, <italic>On a griddle it shall be made</italic> (te&#x2019;aseh) <italic>with oil</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn4733">252</xref></sup> <italic>when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in</italic> (Lev. 6:14).</p>
<p>Observe, the word <italic>miksheh</italic> (of beaten work) here has the same meaning as the word <italic>miksheh</italic> which is written in connection with the cherubim.<sup><xref rid="fn4734">253</xref></sup></p>
<p>EVEN ITS BASE AND ITS SHAFT. This is the body of the menorah.</p>
<p>32. AND THERE SHALL BE SIX BRANCHES. <italic>Kanim</italic> (branches)<sup><xref rid="fn4735">254</xref></sup> refers to a round, long, and hollow object.<sup><xref rid="fn4736">255</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. THREE CUPS. The Gaon says that <italic>meshukkadim</italic> (almond blossoms) means in the shape of almonds. However, the word <italic>meshukkadim</italic> really is related to the word <italic>li-shekod</italic> (attached)<sup><xref rid="fn4737">256</xref></sup> in <italic>Attached daily at my gates</italic> (Prov. 8:34).<sup><xref rid="fn4738">257</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. PURE GOLD. Refined gold without any impurities.</p>
<p>40. AND SEE. The making of the menorah required wisdom. One had to have intellectual perception<sup><xref rid="fn4739">258</xref></sup> to know how to make all these utensils<sup><xref rid="fn4740">259</xref></sup> out of one talent of gold.</p>
<p>[WHICH IS BEING SHOWN.] The word <italic>moreh</italic> (being shown)<sup><xref rid="fn4741">260</xref></sup> is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn4742">261</xref></sup> It is not employed in the same way that the word <italic>mushlakh</italic> (be thrown) (II Sam. 20:21) is,<sup><xref rid="fn4743">262</xref></sup> for the verb <italic>ra&#x2019;ah</italic> (saw) does not come in the <italic>pa&#x2019;ul</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4744">263</xref></sup> Only the term <italic>nireh</italic> (seen)<sup><xref rid="fn4745">264</xref></sup> is employed.<sup><xref rid="fn4746">265</xref></sup> This is so because one who sees is not acting on anything. He merely perceives an image. Those who are versed in the sciences will understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn4747">266</xref></sup></p>
<p>I wish to lay down a fundamental principle to you before I speak on the tabernacle, which also<sup><xref rid="fn4748">267</xref></sup> was made out of curtains [decorated] with cherubim.<sup><xref rid="fn4749">268</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abraham the author says: All that exists, exists in one of the following two ways. One, it exists as a body that has length, width, and depth. The aforementioned results in six sides. From the length of an object comes front and back, from its width right and left, and from its height<sup><xref rid="fn4750">269</xref></sup> up and down. There are also incorporeal beings, namely, God&#x2019;s holy angels and man&#x2019;s soul.</p>
<p>These two types of beings<sup><xref rid="fn4751">270</xref></sup> were created by God alone. It is not in the power of any created being to create a corporeal being. It is certainly beyond the power of any being to create an incorporeal being, for incorporeal beings are more important than corporeal beings.<sup><xref rid="fn4752">271</xref></sup> It is also beyond the power of any created being to totally annihilate another being <sup><xref rid="fn4753">272</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is something which comes very close to existence and is tied to existence but does not exist independently.<sup><xref rid="fn4754">273</xref></sup> This thing is called form.<sup><xref rid="fn4755">274</xref></sup> Form also comes in two ways.</p>
<p>One type of form is permanent and does not pass away, namely, the form of the holy angels and the wisdom which is in the soul.<sup><xref rid="fn4756">275</xref></sup> Form is also found in corporeal elements. The heat of fire and the wetness of water are examples.</p>
<p>The accidents<sup><xref rid="fn4757">276</xref></sup> are the second way in which form manifests itself. The accidents are not permanent. They come and go. They change. They turn and disappear. Man is able to produce accidents.<sup><xref rid="fn4758">277</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is impossible for the glorious God to have a permanent or unchanging<sup><xref rid="fn4759">278</xref></sup> image or picture because God created the essence of all things.<sup><xref rid="fn4760">279</xref></sup> Now, all forms are either permanent or accidents.<sup><xref rid="fn4761">280</xref></sup> Let me give you one example.<sup><xref rid="fn4762">281</xref></sup> The moon is eclipsed<sup><xref rid="fn4763">282</xref></sup> when the earth&#x2019;s shadow enters between the moon and the sun at the head or tail of the dragon.<sup><xref rid="fn4764">283</xref></sup> I will give you another example.<sup><xref rid="fn4765">284</xref></sup> We know that the power of the soul is all over the body. However, there are places in the human body such as the eyes or the nose that are more sensitive than others because of the nerves that go out from the brain. The bones and liver are devoid of sensation. Now the heart is more receptive to the power of the soul than are all other organs of the body. Many organs therefore serve it. Similarly with the glorious God. We know that God&#x2019;s glory fills the world. However, there are places where God&#x2019;s power is more manifest than in other places. This is so for the following two reasons.</p>
<p>Divine manifestation varies in accordance with the natural makeup of the recipient and in accordance with the upper power that is above the receiver.<sup><xref rid="fn4766">285</xref></sup> Therefore, the place of the holy temple [Mount Moriah] was chosen.<sup><xref rid="fn4767">286</xref></sup></p>
<p>If God will give you wisdom, then you will understand the secret of the ark, the ark covering, and the cherubim which spread their wings.<sup><xref rid="fn4768">287</xref></sup> You will also understand the secret of the objects which were placed outside of the curtain,<sup><xref rid="fn4769">288</xref></sup> namely, the menorah, the incense altar, and the table.<sup><xref rid="fn4770">289</xref></sup> You will also comprehend the secret of the objects placed outside of the opening of the tabernacle, namely, the altar of the burnt offering and its utensils and the basin and its base. These objects served to honor God.</p>
<p>I gave you these hints because there are many people in our generations who think they are wise. Perhaps they will mock my words. He who knows the secret of his soul and the makeup of his body is able to understand the workings of the upper world. This is so because man is a microcosm. Man was the last thing created by God when he created the earth. Let this serve as a sign: <italic>He began with the largest</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4771">290</xref></sup> <italic>and finished with the youngest</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4772">291</xref></sup> (Gen. 44:12).<sup><xref rid="fn4773">292</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon notes that there are eighteen objects in the tabernacle which serves as the intermediary world.<sup><xref rid="fn4774">293</xref></sup> The same number of objects is found in the upper word<sup><xref rid="fn4775">294</xref></sup> and also in the microcosm.<sup><xref rid="fn4776">295</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here is a general rule. Each cherub was made to receive power from above. It was also made so that the intelligent will learn.<sup><xref rid="fn4777">296</xref></sup> There is no need to go on.</p>

<ftnote id="fn4495"><sup>14</sup> Scripture enumerates 16 materials donated to the tabernacle (verses 3-7). However, only 15 were donated. One material (silver) was collected.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4499"><sup>18</sup> Thus fewer than 70 souls went down to Egypt. However, here too Scripture speaks of the majority. See I.E. on Gen. 46:23.</ftnote>

Hence I.E. explains why the term <italic>ha-mishkan</italic> is used.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4552"><sup>71</sup> Literally, and so shall ye make. &#x201C;The expression <italic>and so shall ye make it</italic> thus refers only to <italic>the pattern of all the furniture</italic> (mentioned right above), but does not refer to <italic>the pattern of the tabernacle</italic>, since the term &#x2018;making&#x2019; was already stated with reference to it, namely, <italic>and let them make me a sanctuary</italic>&#x201D; (Chavel).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4553"><sup>72</sup> The context requires &#x201C;so shall ye do,&#x201D; that is, <italic>ken ta&#x2019;asu</italic>. Our verse adds an extra <italic>vav</italic>. The <italic>vav</italic> indicates that the verse is connected to what comes before.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4559"><sup>78</sup> If the combined width of any two facing sides of the ark came to half a cubit, then the inside of the ark measured one cubit in width and two in length. Each one of the two tablets which filled the inside of the ark was thus a cubit long and a cubit wide.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4560"><sup>79</sup> That is, that the combined thickness of the top cover and the bottom of the ark was also a half cubit.

<ftnote id="fn4561"><sup>80</sup> A stone measuring a cubed cubit is very heavy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4562"><sup>81</sup> I.E. uses the term &#x201C;perhaps&#x201D; because it is possible that the tablets were not a cubed cubit. See chapter 9 of the <italic>Yesod Morah</italic> where I.E. says that we do not know the height of the tablets or of the ark. He argues that the height for the ark given in our Torah portion does not relate only to the ark but to the ark plus the legs which he assumes the ark had. I.E. argues thus because he believed that it would be impossible for Moses to hold in his hands tablets of stones which measured a cubed cubit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4563"><sup>82</sup> Tired. See Ex. 17:12 and I.E.&#x2019;s comment on it.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4565"><sup>84</sup> I.E. now states his true position, that is, that the tablets were very thin. See note 81.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4566"><sup>85</sup> It is possible that the tablets were engraved on only two sides.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4567"><sup>86</sup> Hence Scripture points out that the Decalogue was written on only two of its sides.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4569"><sup>88</sup> <italic>Yoma</italic> 72b. &#x201C;Bezalel made three arks, two of gold, and one of wood&#x2026;He placed the ark of wood inside the ark of gold, and the ark of gold inside the ark of wood. He covered its upper rim with gold. It was consequently overlaid within and without with gold.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4570"><sup>89</sup> According to the Bible the ark was carried by four men. I.E. questions the ability of four men to carry a piece of furniture constructed of three arks, two of which were made of solid gold.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4571"><sup>90</sup> That is, the ark&#x2019;s covering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4572"><sup>91</sup> According to Rabbinic opinion. See <italic>Sukkah</italic> 5a. This too would add to the ark&#x2019;s weight.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4573"><sup>92</sup> By the Israelites for the construction of the tabernacle. See Ex. 38:24: <italic>All the gold that was used for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4574"><sup>93</sup> For Solomon to use in constructing the temple. See I Chron. 22:14: <italic>Now, behold&#x2026;I</italic> [David] <italic>have prepared for the house of the Lord a hundred thousand talents of gold</italic>. I.E. questions whether Moses had enough gold available to construct two arks of gold of the size described in our chapter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4575"><sup>94</sup> The reference is to the cherubim made by Solomon. See I Kings 6:23-28. The point is that Solomon had much more gold available than Moses did. Nevertheless, he made the cherubim out of olive wood overlaid with gold.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4576"><sup>95</sup> It was made of wood overlaid with gold. See Ex. 30:1-5. Hence it is possible that the ark was also constructed in this fashion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4577"><sup>96</sup> So that it would look as if it was completely made of gold.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4578"><sup>97</sup> Hence the ark was not overly heavy. It should be noted that with the tablets inside, it still was of considerable weight.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4579"><sup>98</sup> The wooden ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4580"><sup>99</sup> So Filwarg. The point is, Solomon could not have thickly covered the walls of the temple with a thick layer of gold. He must have covered it with a very thin layer. We thus see that when one covers wood with gold, one does so very lightly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4581"><sup>100</sup> Translated according to I.E. See I.E. on Ps. 139:3.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4583"><sup>102</sup> For the meaning of <italic>pa&#x2019;amotav</italic> is, its feet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4584"><sup>103</sup> Hence it rested on feet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4585"><sup>104</sup> In the first half of the verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4586"><sup>105</sup> Verse 12 reads: <italic>And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof</italic> (pa&#x2019;amotov); <italic>and two rings</italic> (u-shete ta&#x2019;abotav) <italic>shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it</italic>. I.E. argues that <italic>and two rings shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it</italic> does not refer to the four rings mentioned in the first part of the clause. If it did, our verse would read: And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof (<italic>pa&#x2019;amotav</italic>): two rings shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. There were thus eight rings on the ark. See Nahmonides who quotes I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation and strongly disagreees with him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4587"><sup>106</sup> That the second part of verse 12 does not elaborate upon the first part.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4588"><sup>107</sup> According to this scholar, <italic>and shall set the staves thereof</italic> indicates that the staves were moved from time to time; i.e., they were placed in the top rings when the ark was about to be carried and were removed from the top rings and placed on the lower rings when the ark rested.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4589"><sup>108</sup> Not that the staves were at times placed in the upper rings and at other times in the lower rings. See note 105.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4593"><sup>112</sup> See I Kings 8:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4594"><sup>113</sup> Since the ark was right against the wall, the staves which normally protruded at that end were pushed out toward the opposite end.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4595"><sup>114</sup> Eastward from the ark. Nevertheless, they were not removed from the ark even though they no longer served any purpose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4596"><sup>115</sup> That is, once the ark was placed against the wall, the staves extended for a greater distance than they had before (Meijler). I.E. comments on the staves in Solomon&#x2019;s temple to show that the staves were never removed from the ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4597"><sup>116</sup> Which were placed on the feet of the chest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4598"><sup>117</sup> I.E. explained earlier that once the staves were put in the upper rings, they were not removed from them. Hence he now explains that the lower rings only had an ornamental purpose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4599"><sup>118</sup> Expensive chests have ornaments on them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4600"><sup>119</sup> They did not serve as holders for the staves. They served as ornaments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4601"><sup>120</sup> See verse 13. In other words, <italic>in the rings of the ark</italic> is short for: in the rings that are on the sides of the ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4602"><sup>121</sup> Hebrew, <italic>edut</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4603"><sup>122</sup> I.E. comments thus because some identify the testimony with the Torah. See Rashi, &#x201C;The Testimony refers to the Torah, which is a testimony between Me and you that I have commanded you the commandments that are written in it.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4604"><sup>123</sup> A marriage contract serves as a testimony that a marriage took place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4605"><sup>124</sup> That is why Scripture refers to the tablets as tablets of the covenant. See Deut. 9:9-11. It does so because the tablets recall God&#x2019;s covenant with Israel. A marriage contract similarly recalls the covenant of marriage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4606"><sup>125</sup> For it was the tablets that were placed in the ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4607"><sup>126</sup> That is, Moses had not yet written the book of the Torah. He wrote it shortly before his death. Hence the term testimony cannot refer to the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4608"><sup>127</sup> See Deut. 31:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4609"><sup>128</sup> The tablets placed in the ark. Some rabbis believe that only the second pair of tablets was placed in the ark.

<ftnote id="fn4610"><sup>129</sup> Verse 16 has <italic>testimony</italic> in place of tablets. I.E. is paraphrasing.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4612"><sup>131</sup> See <italic>Baba Batra</italic> 14b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4613"><sup>132</sup> Verse 16 seems to speak of only one set of tablets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4614"><sup>133</sup> Thus verse 16 also refers to the first tablets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4615"><sup>134</sup> For <italic>prima facie</italic>, this appears to apply only to the first set of tablets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4616"><sup>135</sup> Hence God, who is omniscient, could not have been speaking of the first tablets in verse 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4617"><sup>136</sup> That is, the second tablets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4618"><sup>137</sup> See Jerusalem Talmud <italic>Sotah</italic> 8:3; <italic>Shekalim</italic> 6:5. Also see Rashi on Deut. 10:1.

<ftnote id="fn4619"><sup>138</sup> Deut. 10:1.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4624"><sup>143</sup> That is, that we interpret Deut. 10:1,5 as meaning that Moses himself made an ark for the tablets and that this ark is not the one that Bezalel made (Krinsky).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4626"><sup>145</sup> The only ark which we find God commanding Moses to make was the ark Bezalel made. Hence the reference must be to Bezalel&#x2019;s ark.</ftnote>

For the long side of the ark was placed in a north-south direction in the sanctuary (so that both cherubim would face the Holy of Holies) while the curtain that separated the temple proper from the sanctuary was on the eastern wall of the sanctuary (Meijler).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4659"><sup>178</sup> Scripture tells us that the staves were on the side of the ark (v. 12). Hence according to this scholar the staves, contra I.E., could not have been placed along the width of the ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4660"><sup>179</sup> The verse speaks of the length of the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4661"><sup>180</sup> For this verse speaks of the width of the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4662"><sup>181</sup> <italic>Prima facie, With their faces one to another</italic> implies that the cherubim directly faced each other.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4663"><sup>182</sup> In other words, <italic>toward the ark-cover shall the faces of the cherubim be</italic> does not mean that the cherubim shall face straight down to the ark cover as Yefet says. It means that the faces of the cherubim shall incline toward the ark cover.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4664"><sup>183</sup> To list first what comes last, for the tablets were placed in the ark before the cover was put on it. However, our verse tells of the latter before it tells of the former.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4665"><sup>184</sup> Before he put the ark cover over the ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4666"><sup>185</sup> After you place the testimonies in the ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4667"><sup>186</sup> In other words, our verse is to be understood as follows: And thou shalt put the ark cover over the ark; but before this, in the ark thou shalt put the testimonies which I shall give you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4668"><sup>187</sup> According to Rashi our verse contradicts Lev. 1:1. See Rashi on verse 22: &#x201C;[Scripture states] <italic>And I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover</italic> (Ex. 25:22). However, another verse reads, <italic>and spoke unto him out of the tent of meeting</italic>, (that is, the tabernacle outside of the curtain) <italic>saying</italic> (Lev. 1:1). We thus find two verses contradicting each other. A third verse comes and reconciles them; viz<italic>., And when Moses went into the tent of meeting&#x2026;then he heard the Voice speaking unto him from above the ark-cover</italic> (Num. 7:29). Moses entered the tabernacle and when he came to the entrance a Voice descended from heaven toward (the place) between the cherubim, and from thence it went forth and was heard by Moses in the tent of meeting.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4669"><sup>188</sup> Hence it also refers to the Holy of Holies where the ark was.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4670"><sup>189</sup> Or reconciling.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4671"><sup>190</sup> See note 184.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4672"><sup>191</sup> The word <italic>et</italic> has no translatable meaning. It serves to connect a verb with the direct object. In this case, it connects <italic>ve-dibbarti</italic> (and I will speak) with what follows <italic>et</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4673"><sup>192</sup> Our versions of the Torah do not have a <italic>vav</italic> before the word <italic>et</italic>. We might also note that Rashi&#x2019;s Torah scrolls also read <italic>ve-et</italic>. Rashi considered this <italic>vav</italic> superfluous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4674"><sup>193</sup> Without the <italic>vav</italic> our verse reads: <italic>and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel</italic>. With the <italic>vav</italic>, our verse reads: and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of testimony, <span class="underline">and</span> of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4675"><sup>194</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that our verse is to be read as follows: and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of testimony, and I will further speak to you of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4676"><sup>195</sup> In other words, part 2 of the verse does not tell us what part 1 of the verse refers to. This would not be the case if the word <italic>et</italic> did not have a <italic>vav</italic> before it. In the latter case, part 2 of the verse would go on to explain what God spoke to Moses about.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4677"><sup>196</sup> In other words, part 1 deals with a private dialogue between God and Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4678"><sup>197</sup> In other words, part 1 deals with a private dialogue between God and Moses. Part 2 deals with the commandment which Moses was to transmit to Israel. Hence the connective <italic>vav</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4679"><sup>198</sup> That is, why is the ark the first sacred item which Moses was commanded to make?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4680"><sup>199</sup> The tabernacle is mentioned first. Thus God should have told Moses to first construct a tabernacle and then to make the furniture which was to be placed therein.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4681"><sup>200</sup> A sentence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4682"><sup>201</sup> Scripture mentions Jacob before Esau. We would thus expect for Scripture to deal with Jacob before Esau. However, it goes on to deal with Esau. We thus see that Scripture elaborates first on what it dealt with last.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4683"><sup>202</sup> Because that is what is mentioned last in verse 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4684"><sup>203</sup> The ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4685"><sup>204</sup> See Ex. 35:1; 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4686"><sup>205</sup> As to how to construct the tabernacle. Krinsky claims that the reference is to the Midrash, which says that Bezalel took issue with Moses over what order to follow in constructing the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4687"><sup>206</sup> In our Torah portion. It is mentioned in Ex. 35:15. However, it should also have been mentioned here along with the other furniture that was placed inside the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4688"><sup>207</sup> I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the tabernacle may be compared to a king&#x2019;s palace. Indeed, Scripture states that the tabernacle served as a dwelling place for God, <italic>let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them</italic> (v. 8). Hence it had to be suitably furnished.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4689"><sup>208</sup> In other words, the tabernacle served, as it were, as God&#x2019;s dwelling place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4690"><sup>209</sup> For God, who dwelt there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4691"><sup>210</sup> They served to furnish God&#x2019;s house. A table and a lamp were the typical furnishings of a house. See II Kings 4:10, &#x201C;Let us make&#x2026;a little chamber on the roof; and let us set&#x2026;there&#x2026;a table&#x2026;and a candlestick.&#x201D;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4692"><sup>211</sup> He couldn&#x2019;t issue this command without first dealing with burnt offerings, meal offerings, or drink offerings. These offerings were brought to the altar which stood in the courtyard of the tabernacle. Hence Scripture delayed the command to make an incense altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4693"><sup>212</sup> When he relayed God&#x2019;s command to Israel regarding the construction of the tabernacle. For the incense altar was stationed in the same section of the tabernacle as the menorah, namely, in the Holy of Holies. See Ex. 35:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4694"><sup>213</sup> See Ex. 37:25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4695"><sup>214</sup> That is, the table top.</ftnote>

Contra to what Krinsky, Meijler, and others write, it appears that I.E. does not accept the Rabbinic interpretation. In fact, in the short commentary he renders <italic>kesotav</italic> as cups (<italic>kosot</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4703"><sup>222</sup> According to I.E., <italic>kesavot</italic> are jars used in pouring.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4704"><sup>223</sup> For they were not used for pouring.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4705"><sup>224</sup> For God did not speak to Samuel in the pillar of cloud. We thus see that a clause does not always refer to what immediately precedes it.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4707"><sup>226</sup> The Hebrew text literally reads: They shall not pour out wine (<italic>yayyin</italic>) to the Lord. I.E. either paraphrased or quoted from memory and erred.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4708"><sup>227</sup> I.E. comments thus because of the word <italic>yussakh</italic> (pour out) in our verse. <italic>Yussakh</italic> is the <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic> form of <italic>nasakh</italic>. It is noteworthy that none of the meanings that I.E. quotes for this word fit in with the Rabbinic interpretation of <italic>yussakh</italic>. As it will be recalled, the rabbis interpreted <italic>yussakh</italic> to mean was covered. See note 221.</ftnote>

However, he has no manuscript evidence to back up his emendation. S.Y. Rapaport does not believe that I.E. would have uttered such a word. In keeping with his theory that the long commentary was composed by students of I.E. from notes taken at their master&#x2019;s lectures, he claims that the students misunderstood what I.E. said (See <italic>Toledot Rabbenu Natan</italic>, S.Y. Rapaport, p. 30). Unlike Filwarg and Rapaport, Nahmanides had no doubts that I.E. uttered these words. He comments, &#x201C;Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: &#x2018;There is an error in Chronicles&#x2026;&#x2019; The error, however, is in Rabbi Abraham&#x2019;s words (not in the Book of Chronicles)&#x201D; (Chavel translation). Nahmanides goes on to say that I Chron 28:17 does not speak only of the utensils made for the table but also of other utensils made for the altar. It should be noted that I.E. goes on to reconcile I Chron. 28:17 and our verse. However, Nahmanides did not accept his interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4715"><sup>234</sup> The list of utensils made for the table as recorded in I Chron. 28:17 does not match the list in our verse.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4717"><sup>236</sup> The Book of Chronicles tells us that Solomon made 10 tables (II Chron. 4:8). I.E. suggests that these tables had different utensils than the table made by Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4718"><sup>237</sup> It had different utensils. It is also possible that I.E. was of the opinion that the construction of the table placed in the tabernacle differed from the ones made by Solomon. Hence, its utensils differed.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4720"><sup>239</sup> Scripture goes on to say that the <italic>showbread</italic> (lekhem ha-panim) <italic>before Me alway</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn4721"><sup>240</sup> According to the sages the bread was called <italic>lekhem ha-panim</italic> (literally, bread of faces) because it was baked in a mold with the two sides open.

<p>1. MOREOVER THOU SHALT MAKE THE TABERNACLE. As you were first told, namely, <italic>the pattern of the tabernacle</italic> (Ex. 25:9).<sup><xref rid="fn4778">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE WORK OF THE SKILLFUL WORKMAN. Our sages said that <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh choshev</italic> (the work of the skillful workman) refers to two faces, and [<italic>ma&#x2019;aseh</italic>] <italic>rokem</italic> (the work of the weaver) (v. 36)<sup><xref rid="fn4779">2</xref></sup> to one image. What they said is correct. However, according to the plain meaning of the text, <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh choshev</italic> is neither needle-work nor weaving.<sup><xref rid="fn4780">3</xref></sup> It refers rather to a process employed today in making silk garments. The image that arises in the heart comes from insight and thought.<sup><xref rid="fn4781">4</xref></sup> The artist draws it upon a tablet. He then places two threads upon the image which he thought up in order to draw it from a distance.<sup><xref rid="fn4782">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. THE LENGTH. The uninformed say that the curtains were twenty-eight cubits in length because of the twenty-eight stages<sup><xref rid="fn4783">6</xref></sup> of the moon. However, actually there were ten curtains over the tabernacle to correspond with <italic>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain</italic> (Ps. 104:2).<sup><xref rid="fn4784">7</xref></sup> The place of the Holy of Holies therefore was a cube in measure.<sup><xref rid="fn4785">8</xref></sup></p>

COUPLED. <italic>Choverot</italic> (coupled) is an adjective.<sup><xref rid="fn4786">9</xref></sup> On the other hand, it might be a verb<sup><xref rid="fn4787">10</xref></sup> meaning that this curtain coupled the other curtain. <italic>Ephraim is joined</italic> (chavur) <italic>to idols</italic> (Hos. 4:17), wherein <italic>chavur</italic> is a <italic>pu&#x2019;al</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn4788">11</xref></sup> is proof of the aforementioned.<sup><xref rid="fn4789">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. LOOPS. Some say that the word <italic>u-ve-lullim</italic> (and by winding stairs) in <italic>and they went up by winding stairs into the middle row</italic> (I Kings 6:8) is similar to the word <italic>lule&#x2019;ot</italic> (loops),<sup><xref rid="fn4790">13</xref></sup> for the <italic>bet</italic> in <italic>u-ve-lullim</italic> is a preposition.<sup><xref rid="fn4791">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>THAT IS OUTMOST. The word <italic>ha-kitzonah</italic> (that is outmost) is an adjective like the word <italic>ha-elyonah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4792">15</xref></sup> (that is uppermost).</p>
<p>5. FIFTY. Scripture now mentions the number of loops.</p>
<p>[OPPOSITE.] The word <italic>makbilot</italic> (opposite) means this one was opposite the other.<sup><xref rid="fn4793">16</xref></sup> There are those who say that the word <italic>koval</italic> (before)<sup><xref rid="fn4794">17</xref></sup> in <italic>and smote him before the people</italic> (II Kings 15:10) and <italic>kavolo</italic> (opposite it) in <italic>and shall strike that which is opposite it</italic> (Ezek. 26:9)<sup><xref rid="fn4795">18</xref></sup> are similar.</p>
<p>[ONE.] The word <italic>ishah</italic> (one)<sup><xref rid="fn4796">19</xref></sup> means the very thing.<sup><xref rid="fn4797">20</xref></sup> The same is true with the word <italic>ish</italic> (man). Scripture therefore reads, <italic>ve-ha-ish gavri&#x2019;el</italic> (the man Gabriel) (Dan. 9:21).<sup><xref rid="fn4798">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND THOU SHALT MAKE FIFTY CLASPS<sup><xref rid="fn4799">22</xref></sup> OF GOLD. The word <italic>kores</italic> (stoopeth) in <italic>Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth</italic> (Is. 46:1) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn4800">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT THE TABERNACLE MAY BE ONE WHOLE.] Look, the term tabernacle refers to the ten curtains. The tabernacle is called one, and it encompass all ten [curtains] for all physical entities are made of various elements. Similarly God the revered, who is One. God includes everything and is called One.<sup><xref rid="fn4801">24</xref></sup> The same is true with the microcosm<sup><xref rid="fn4802">25</xref></sup> and the macrocosm.<sup><xref rid="fn4803">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND THOU SHALT MAKE CURTAINS OF GOATS&#x2019; HAIR FOR A TENT. <italic>Le-ohel</italic> (for a tent)<sup><xref rid="fn4804">27</xref></sup> means to serve as a tent.</p>
<p>[THEM.] The word <italic>otam</italic> (them) is there for purposes of additional explanation,<sup><xref rid="fn4805">28</xref></sup> as it refers to the curtains of goats&#x2019; hair.<sup><xref rid="fn4806">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. THE LENGTH OF EACH CURTAIN. The word <italic>achat</italic> (each) is irregular. The word should have read <italic>achedet</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn4807">30</xref></sup> for the <italic>dalet</italic> is not a letter that serves as a prefix or a suffix.<sup><xref rid="fn4808">31</xref></sup> However, the <italic>dalet</italic> was dropped because it is very hard to sound a <italic>dalet</italic> and a <italic>tav</italic>, both of which are dentals, back to back. It<sup><xref rid="fn4809">32</xref></sup> was dropped for the same reason that the <italic>tav</italic> in <italic>meshasrat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4810">33</xref></sup> (ministered) in <italic>ministered unto the king</italic> (II Kings 1:15) was dropped.</p>
<p>9. FIVE. The word <italic>chamesh</italic> (five) is vocalized with a <italic>sheva</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4811">34</xref></sup> and a <italic>pattach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn4812">35</xref></sup> It is an abridged form,<sup><xref rid="fn4813">36</xref></sup> like the word <italic>shelosh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4814">37</xref></sup> (three) in <italic>shelosh se&#x2019;im</italic> (three measures) (Gen. 18:6).<sup><xref rid="fn4815">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND SHALT DOUBLE OVER THE SIXTH CURTAIN IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE TENT.] Observe, when the sixth curtain was doubled,<sup><xref rid="fn4816">39</xref></sup> half of a curtain<sup><xref rid="fn4817">40</xref></sup> was left at the end.<sup><xref rid="fn4818">41</xref></sup> Hence Scripture states, <italic>the half curtain that remaineth over</italic> (v. 12). There is no need<sup><xref rid="fn4819">42</xref></sup> to mention that the length of the curtains was placed over the width of the tabernacle. Now the width of the tabernacle was ten cubits, and the height of its two sides was nine cubits.<sup><xref rid="fn4820">43</xref></sup> Scripture therefore states, <italic>And the cubit on the one side</italic> (v. 13) to cover the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn4821">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND THOU SHALT MAKE FIFTY LOOPS. The number of loops on the curtains of the tent<sup><xref rid="fn4822">45</xref></sup> was the same as the number of loops of the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn4823">46</xref></sup> The same applies to the clasps.<sup><xref rid="fn4824">47</xref></sup> However, the loops and the clasps of the tent<sup><xref rid="fn4825">48</xref></sup> were not opposite the loops and the clasps of the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn4826">49</xref></sup> On the contrary, they were two cubits behind them towards the west.<sup><xref rid="fn4827">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND THOU SHALT MAKE. The clasps of the curtains which made up the tabernacle<sup><xref rid="fn4828">51</xref></sup> were made of gold because they were used for the most important curtains. The tent served as a cover over the tabernacle. Its clasps were therefore made of brass.<sup><xref rid="fn4829">52</xref></sup> The brass clasps were not visible because there were two covers over the tent.<sup><xref rid="fn4830">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND AS FOR THE OVERHANGING PART&#x2026;THE HALF CURTAIN. The term half is sometimes used in the sense of close to a half, as in <italic>and the half-tribe of Manasseh</italic> (Josh. 22:9). When we come to the description of the boards you will understand that which requires explanation.<sup><xref rid="fn4831">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND THE CUBIT&#x2026;WHICH REMAINETH OVER. The word <italic>ba-odef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4832">55</xref></sup> (which remaineth over) is like the word <italic>oved</italic> (perishing). It is an adjective,<sup><xref rid="fn4833">56</xref></sup> as the cantillical note is placed on the last syllable.<sup><xref rid="fn4834">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THOU SHALT MAKE A COVERING. Over the covering<sup><xref rid="fn4835">58</xref></sup> because of the rain.<sup><xref rid="fn4836">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THOU SHALT MAKE THE BOARDS FOR THE TABERNACLE. The term tabernacle only applies to the curtains<sup><xref rid="fn4837">60</xref></sup> and the boards.<sup><xref rid="fn4838">61</xref></sup> As God informed Moses of the tabernacle,<sup><xref rid="fn4839">62</xref></sup> so did He inform him of the boards.<sup><xref rid="fn4840">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>[STANDING UP.] The word <italic>omedim</italic> means standing up as it grew on the tree,<sup><xref rid="fn4841">64</xref></sup> for the length of the wood<sup><xref rid="fn4842">65</xref></sup> is its height.<sup><xref rid="fn4843">66</xref></sup> The same applies to a person when he stands. The opposite is the case when he lies down.<sup><xref rid="fn4844">67</xref></sup> On the other hand, the word <italic>omedim</italic> might mean standing straight up.<sup><xref rid="fn4845">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. TEN CUBITS. We do not know whether the cubits of the tabernacle were measured from the armpits<sup><xref rid="fn4846">69</xref></sup> like Ezekiel&#x2019;s cubits.<sup><xref rid="fn4847">70</xref></sup> Logically, the cubits of the first temple were of such cubits,<sup><xref rid="fn4848">71</xref></sup> as we find that the Book Of Chronicles<sup><xref rid="fn4849">72</xref></sup> speaks of the earlier<sup><xref rid="fn4850">73</xref></sup> measure.<sup><xref rid="fn4851">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. TWO TENONS. The word <italic>yadot</italic> (tenons) comes from the same root as <italic>yad</italic> (hands).</p>
<p>JOINED. The word <italic>meshullavot</italic> (joined) has no cognate except for the word <italic>ha-shelabbim</italic> (the stays) (I Kings 7:29).</p>
<p>18. AND THOU SHALT MAKE. Observe&#x0021; Scripture does not record the thickness of the boards. The ancients<sup><xref rid="fn4852">75</xref></sup> said that each board was a cubit thick. If this is the case<sup><xref rid="fn4853">76</xref></sup> then the southern wall, which was thirty cubits, [was a cubit thick]. This was also the case with the northern wall.<sup><xref rid="fn4854">77</xref></sup> Thus a space measuring eight cubits in width<sup><xref rid="fn4855">78</xref></sup> was left for the western wall.<sup><xref rid="fn4856">79</xref></sup> However, eight boards<sup><xref rid="fn4857">80</xref></sup> had to be placed there.<sup><xref rid="fn4858">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that the ancients were compelled to say that the boards were a cubit thick. They were compelled to say that the boards were a cubit thick because of the middle bar<sup><xref rid="fn4859">82</xref></sup> which was inserted into the boards.<sup><xref rid="fn4860">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn4861">84</xref></sup> the bar could only lay there by a miracle.<sup><xref rid="fn4862">85</xref></sup> According to the plain meaning of the text there were three middle bars.<sup><xref rid="fn4863">86</xref></sup> Scripture similarly writes, <italic>from end to end</italic> (v. 28).<sup><xref rid="fn4864">87</xref></sup> It does not state<sup><xref rid="fn4865">88</xref></sup> from end<sup><xref rid="fn4866">89</xref></sup> to the ends.<sup><xref rid="fn4867">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now if the sages received a tradition that the boards were a cubit in thickness, then we will accept their tradition. However, if they arrived at this measurement by reasoning, then we can explain it differently. The two bars, namely, the upper two bars, and likewise the two lower bars,<sup><xref rid="fn4868">91</xref></sup> reached half of the wall.<sup><xref rid="fn4869">92</xref></sup> The middle bar that was placed <italic>in the midst</italic> (be-tokh) <italic>of the boards</italic> (v. 28) passed through from end to end.<sup><xref rid="fn4870">93</xref></sup> <italic>To work it in the midst</italic> (be-tokh) <italic>of the blue, and in the midst of the purple</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4871">94</xref></sup> (Ex. 39:3) is similar,<sup><xref rid="fn4872">95</xref></sup> as is <italic>and put the bells in the midst</italic> (be-tokh) <italic>of the pomegranates</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4873">96</xref></sup> (Ex. 39:25). The middle bars would not have been covered with gold<sup><xref rid="fn4874">97</xref></sup> if they were not placed on the surface of the boards.<sup><xref rid="fn4875">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>If we admit that we do not know the thickness of each board, then we can explain the structure of the western wall. Now, they first set up the western wall. For two boards were set aside to serve as corners<sup><xref rid="fn4876">99</xref></sup> of the tabernacle,<sup><xref rid="fn4877">100</xref></sup> as the meaning of <italic>mekutzot</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4878">101</xref></sup> is corners. The same was true of half of the corners of the courtyard,<sup><xref rid="fn4879">102</xref></sup> for the courtyard<sup><xref rid="fn4880">103</xref></sup> was in the form of a parallelogram.</p>
<p>We thus have two corners. Now these two corner boards were not the same size as the other boards mentioned in Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn4881">104</xref></sup> Scripture therefore separates these boards<sup><xref rid="fn4882">105</xref></sup> and says, <italic>thus shall it be for them both</italic> (v. 24), that is, only for them and not for any of the other boards. The tabernacle was erected by utilizing these two boards. The remaining six boards<sup><xref rid="fn4883">106</xref></sup> were placed in the middle.<sup><xref rid="fn4884">107</xref></sup> The width of the tabernacle was thus ten cubits.<sup><xref rid="fn4885">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>We do not know if the corner boards were square or round,<sup><xref rid="fn4886">109</xref></sup> for we have only one remaining cubit.<sup><xref rid="fn4887">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Rabbi Solomon&#x2019;s explanation, these boards did not stand in a straight line<sup><xref rid="fn4888">111</xref></sup> because half a cubit was inside the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn4889">112</xref></sup> We are dealing with boards, not with garments.<sup><xref rid="fn4890">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>They then<sup><xref rid="fn4891">114</xref></sup> set up the boards on the northern and southern sides. Now an amount equivalent to the thickness of the boards<sup><xref rid="fn4892">115</xref></sup> protruded<sup><xref rid="fn4893">116</xref></sup> from the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn4894">117</xref></sup> The pillar<sup><xref rid="fn4895">118</xref></sup> of the opening of the tabernacle was therefore opposite it.<sup><xref rid="fn4896">119</xref></sup> The half a curtain of goatskin<sup><xref rid="fn4897">120</xref></sup> fixed it.<sup><xref rid="fn4898">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. AND THOU SHALT REAR UP THE TABERNACLE. Moses should tell this to the wise-hearted.<sup><xref rid="fn4899">122</xref></sup> Or, Scripture states, <italic>And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle</italic> because Moses reared it up first.<sup><xref rid="fn4900">123</xref></sup> However, there were others with him,<sup><xref rid="fn4901">124</xref></sup> for many people were required to rear up the tabernacle.</p>
<p>31. AND THOU SHALT MAKE A VEIL. We find that Solomon acted similarly with regard to the opening of the Holy of Holies.<sup><xref rid="fn4902">125</xref></sup> The wall<sup><xref rid="fn4903">126</xref></sup> was possibly made out of wood.<sup><xref rid="fn4904">127</xref></sup> Scripture notes that the entire house<sup><xref rid="fn4905">128</xref></sup> measured sixty cubits,<sup><xref rid="fn4906">129</xref></sup> and Rashi,<sup><xref rid="fn4907">130</xref></sup> of blessed memory, explains the Holy measured forty cubits and the Holy of Holies twenty cubits.<sup><xref rid="fn4908">131</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sockets<sup><xref rid="fn4909">132</xref></sup> were made of silver<sup><xref rid="fn4910">133</xref></sup> out of respect for the ark.</p>
<p>The Holy of Holies in the temple was double that of the one in the tabernacle in length, width, and height.<sup><xref rid="fn4911">134</xref></sup> Do not be astonished that Scripture writes<sup><xref rid="fn4912">135</xref></sup> that the temple was thirty cubits in height and the Holy of Holies took up a third of the temple.<sup><xref rid="fn4913">136</xref></sup> For there were upper stories directly above the ark cover that is over the Holy of Holies.<sup><xref rid="fn4914">137</xref></sup> The Book of Chronicles tells us, <italic>And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold</italic> (II Chron. 3:9).</p>
<p>33. AND THE VEIL SHALL DIVIDE UNTO YOU. The word <italic>ve-hivdilah</italic> (shall divide) is irregular in that it is ultimately accented.<sup><xref rid="fn4915">138</xref></sup> The same is true of the word <italic>ve-hikkita</italic> (and thou shalt smite) in <italic>and thou shalt smite the rock</italic> (Ex. 17:6).<sup><xref rid="fn4916">139</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. AND THOU SHALT MAKE A SCREEN&#x2026;THE WORK OF THE WEAVER. <italic>Ma&#x2019;aseh rokem</italic> (the work of the weaver)<sup><xref rid="fn4917">140</xref></sup> is inferior to <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh chosev</italic> (the work of the skillful workman).<sup><xref rid="fn4918">141</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pillars<sup><xref rid="fn4919">142</xref></sup> were covered with gold and the hooks were likewise covered with gold of respect for God. The sockets of the pillars were made out of brass because the screen was in between.<sup><xref rid="fn4920">143</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn4778"><sup>1</sup> Moses was told to make the tabernacle according to the pattern which he had been shown earlier. I.E. comments thus because Scripture reads, <italic>ha-mishkan</italic> (the tabernacle), i.e., the earlier-noted tabernacle, rather than tabernacle (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4779"><sup>2</sup> See <italic>Yoma</italic> 72:b: &#x201C;It was taught in the name of Rabbi Nehemiah <italic>rokem</italic> (weaving) is needlework, therefore it has only one face. <italic>Choshev</italic> is weaving work, therefore it has two faces.&#x201D; According to Rashi, one face means the same image on both sides of the curtain. Two faces means a different image on each side of the curtain, e.g., &#x201C;a lion on one side, and an eagle on the other side.&#x201D; Also see Rashi on <italic>Yoma</italic> 72b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4780"><sup>3</sup> According to I.E. needlework or weaving did not entail artistic skill. Hence it could not be considered <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh choshev</italic>, which literally means the work of an artist.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4781"><sup>4</sup> Literally, and its thought. Hebrew, <italic>machashvtah</italic> (and its thought). Meijler suggests emending to <italic>machashavah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4782"><sup>5</sup> It isn&#x2019;t clear what I.E. had in mind. Meijler suggests that some words might be missing from our texts. Rabbi Isaac Sarim (<italic>Be&#x2019;er Yitzchak</italic>, Israel, 1991) comments, &#x201C;I was not worthy to understand his (I.E.&#x2019;s) holy words. One has to be an expert silk worker to understand his words.&#x201D; According to Weiser, I.E. is describing the transfer of an image from a wooden tablet to silk. This is done by holding the tablet over the silk by two threads (or chords) and then dropping it, thus imprinting it upon the screen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4783"><sup>6</sup> Literally, camps. The moon has a slightly different appearance each night of the month. According to Meijler, I.E. rejected this opinion because the curtains were 28 cubits in length merely in order to cover the width of the tabernacle and its sideboards down to the sockets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4784"><sup>7</sup> In other words, the ten curtains of the tabernacle corresponded to the heavens which contain the ten spheres. The tabernacle was, as it were, God&#x2019;s dwelling place. See I.E. on Ex. 25:40.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4785"><sup>8</sup> The Holy of Holies was 10 cubits wide, 10 cubits in length, and 10 cubits height. These measurements corresponded to the ten spheres.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4786"><sup>9</sup> Literally, is in the form of an adjective. If <italic>choverot</italic> is an adjective, then our verse reads: five curtains coupled together, one to another.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4787"><sup>10</sup> Literally, it has the form of a verb. If <italic>choverot</italic> is a verb, then our verse should be translated: five curtains coupling one another.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4788"><sup>11</sup> The third person perfect passive form of <italic>chover</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4789"><sup>12</sup> That <italic>choveret</italic> is a verb. If a verb is found in the passive, it must have an active counterpart. It should be noted that <italic>choveret</italic> is the feminine form of <italic>chover</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4790"><sup>13</sup> In our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4791"><sup>14</sup> Thus the basic word in Kings is <italic>lullim. Lullim</italic> is masculine plural. <italic>Lule&#x2019;ot</italic> is its feminine counterpart.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4792"><sup>15</sup> II Kings 18:17; Is. 7:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4793"><sup>16</sup> So Weiser and Krinsky. However, Filwarg renders: each loop was ready to receive (<italic>le-kabbel</italic>) the other loop.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4794"><sup>17</sup> Or opposite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4795"><sup>18</sup> Translated literally. The reference is to a battering ram.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4796"><sup>19</sup> Literally, a women. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4797"><sup>20</sup> For an explanation of this comment see I.E. on Gen. 15:10 and the notes thereto. Also see I.E. on Ex. 15:3.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4801"><sup>24</sup> This is a very difficult comment: it borders on pantheism. See I.E. on Gen. 1:26 and the notes thereto. Cohen paraphrases, &#x201C;God is One but comprehends all.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4802"><sup>25</sup> Man. We speak of one man. However, a man is made up of many parts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4803"><sup>26</sup> We speak of one vast world. However, the world is made up of various parts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4804"><sup>27</sup> Literally, to tent. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4805"><sup>28</sup> The word them in <italic>eleven curtains shalt thou make them</italic> appears to be unnecessary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4806"><sup>29</sup> Scripture tells us that the eleven curtains mentioned in the second part of the verse refer to the curtains of goat&#x2019;s hair mentioned in the first part of the verse.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4812"><sup>35</sup> That is, a <italic>tzere</italic>. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that the word <italic>chamesh</italic> is in the construct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4813"><sup>36</sup> Our verse should have read, <italic>chamesh ha-yeri&#x2019;ot</italic>, (vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath the <italic>chet</italic>), rather than <italic>chamesh</italic> (vocalized with a <italic>chataf pattach</italic> beneath the <italic>chet) ha-yeri&#x2019;ot</italic>, for the construct indicates possession. Thus <italic>chayyat ha-sadeh</italic> (animals of the field) is short for <italic>chayyot shel hasadeh</italic> (animals of the field).

<ftnote id="fn4817"><sup>40</sup> Literally, half of it. The reference obviously cannot be to the front curtain. It must be to the last curtain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4818"><sup>41</sup> Of the tabernacle. There were 11 curtains. Each curtain was 4 cubits in width, making a total of 44 cubits when the curtains were joined. The tabernacle was 30 cubits in length. Its back (the western side of the tabernacle) was 10 cubits in height. When the joined curtain was placed over the length of the tabernacle, 10 cubits covered the back of the tabernacle, 20 covered the top of the tabernacle, and 2 cubits extended over the front of the tabernacle. There were thus 2 cubits remaining. These trailed behind the back of the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4819"><sup>42</sup> For Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4820"><sup>43</sup> The curtains were 28 cubits long. The width of the tabernacle was 10 cubits. The side boards of the tabernacle were 10 cubits in height. However, only 9 cubits were exposed because one cubit was covered by the sockets. It stands to reason that the length of curtains was placed over the width of the tabernacle to cover its sides and top.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4821"><sup>44</sup> A curtain made of goats&#x2019; hair was placed over the first set of curtains. This curtain was 30 cubits long. Verse 13 tells us that the 2 extra cubits served to cover the exposed sockets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4822"><sup>45</sup> That is, the curtains made of goats&#x2019; hair. These curtains served as a tent over the tabernacle. See verse 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4823"><sup>46</sup> The first set of curtains made from woven fabric. According to I.E. the term tabernacle (<italic>mishkan</italic>) refers to these curtains. See I.E. on verses 6 and 15.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4826"><sup>49</sup> That is, the fabric curtains.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4838"><sup>61</sup> Hence when God said, <italic>the pattern of the tabernacle</italic> (Ex. 25:9), the boards were included.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4840"><sup>63</sup> Hence Scripture reads, <italic>ha-kerashim</italic> (the boards), that is, the boards previously alluded to in the word <italic>mishkan</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4841"><sup>64</sup> The wood is to be in the same position as it was when it grew as part of a tree. In other words, it is to be placed in a vertical position. Cf.

You shall not make the walls out of lying boards so that the width of the boards constitutes the height of the walls.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4842"><sup>65</sup> Spoken of in the next verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4843"><sup>66</sup> Hence Scripture states, <italic>shall stand up</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4844"><sup>67</sup> When a person lies down, his length is not in a vertical position. The same applies to a board. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that <italic>omedim</italic> (standing) means that the long side of the board is to be placed in a vertical position.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4846"><sup>69</sup> Hebrew, <italic>atzilah</italic> (where the arm joins the shoulder) (Krinsky). An alternate interpretation is: we do not know whether the cubits of the tabernacle&#x2019;s &#x201C;noble cubits&#x201D; are like Ezekiel&#x2019;s cubits. A &#x201C;noble cubit&#x201D; is a cubit that is larger then the ordinary cubit (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4847"><sup>70</sup> Ezek. 41:8. The cubits mentioned in Ezek. 41:8 measured from the armpit to the finger tips (Krinsky). Ordinary cubits measure from the elbow to the fingertips.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4848"><sup>71</sup> <italic>Prima facie</italic>, it appears that I.E. means that they were the same type of cubits as those spoken of by Ezekiel. However, this cannot be so because I.E. goes on to quote II Chron. 3:3 to the effect that the earlier cubits, i.e., the smaller cubits, were employed in the temple. We must thus interpret &#x201C;of such cubits&#x201D; as referring to the cubits of the tabernacle. See Sarim. For alternate interpretations see Meijler and Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4849"><sup>72</sup> II Chron. 3:3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4850"><sup>73</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. The printed editions have <italic>middah acharonah</italic> (the later measure). This appears to be an error, for II Chron. 3:3 explicitly reads, <italic>ba-middah ha-risonah</italic> (the earlier or the ancient measure). The earlier measure refers to the measure employed in the tabernacle. It is possible that the reading of the later measure occurred because of the problem pointed out in note 70. On the other hand, it is possible that I.E. quoted from memory and erred, and that the printed texts rather than <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 preserve the original reading. In this case, &#x201C;were of such cubits&#x201D; refers to Ezekiel&#x2019;s cubits.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4852"><sup>75</sup> The rabbis of the Talmud. See <italic>Sabbath</italic> 98b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4853"><sup>76</sup> Krinsky quotes an opinion which suggests this emendation: &#x201C;If this is the case, the southern wall was a cubit thick. This was also the case with the northern wall. Thus only the width of 8 cubits was left for the western wall.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4854"><sup>77</sup> The southern and northern walls of the tabernacle consisted of 20 boards, each of which was 1 1/2 cubits in width.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4855"><sup>78</sup> The tabernacle was 10 cubits in width. This can be ascertained from the size of the fabric and goats&#x2019; hair curtains which covered the tabernacle. These curtains were 28 and 30 cubits long. Ten cubits of the former covered the width of the tabernacle down to the sockets; 10 cubits of the latter covered the width of the tabernacle as well as its sideboards and sockets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4856"><sup>79</sup> For the northern and southern walls each took up a cubit. I.E. believed that the tabernacle was 10 cubits in width and 30 in length only as measured from the outside.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4857"><sup>80</sup> See verses 22 and 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4858"><sup>81</sup> Each of which was 1 1/2 cubits wide. The question thus arises, how do we fit these boards into a space of 8 cubits? The width of each board was thus obviously not a cubit. I.E. will later explain that the space on the west measured about 10 cubits and that only six of the eight boards measured 1 1/2 cubits.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4859"><sup>82</sup> See verse 28. According to the Talmud this middle bar was inserted into the boards themselves.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4860"><sup>83</sup> There are those who would emend to: It is possible they were compelled to say that the boards were a cubit thick because of the middle bar which was inserted into the boards (Krinsky). It should be noted that the text of this chapter appears to be especially corrupt due to the difficulty of understanding I.E.&#x2019;s comments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4861"><sup>84</sup> Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4862"><sup>85</sup> According to the Talmud <italic>Sabbath</italic> 98b, &#x201C;It (the middle bar) lay there by miracle&#x201D; (Soncino translation). Rashi in his comments on the Talmud explains that one long middle bar was placed into one of the boards and it miraculously snaked around all three sides of the tabernacle. This comment is not in our editions of Rashi on the Pentateuch. In our editions, Rashi merely notes that a separate middle bar was inserted into each of the three sides of the tabernacle. I.E. probably quoted Rashi from memory and attributed to him here what he wrote in his commentary on the Talmud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4863"><sup>86</sup> That is, each had its own separate middle bar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4864"><sup>87</sup> The middle bar reached from end to end.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4865"><sup>88</sup> Which it would if one middle bar encircled all the sides of the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4866"><sup>89</sup> That is, from one end.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4867"><sup>90</sup> To all the other ends.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4868"><sup>91</sup> Each wall of the tabernacle had five bars (v. 27). I.E. explains that there were two top bars, two bottom bars, and one middle bar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4869"><sup>92</sup> One of the top bars was placed along half the length of the walls of the tabernacle starting from one direction. Another was placed in the same position starting from the other side. They met in the center. The bottom bars were similarly placed. A middle bar which extended from one end to the other end was placed between the upper and lower bars.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4870"><sup>93</sup> In other words, the middle bar was not inserted into the boards. It was placed on the outside of the boards, as explained in note 91.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4871"><sup>94</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4872"><sup>95</sup> According to I.E. the word <italic>be-tokh</italic> (in the midst) does not always literally mean in the midst of an object&#x2019;s very body. It can be taken to mean midpoint or between. Thus in Ex. 39:3, <italic>be-tokh</italic> (in the midst) means among. Similarly, in verse 28 <italic>be-tokh ha-kerahsim</italic> does not mean in the very midst of the board&#x2019;s body but rather at the midpoint of the board&#x2019;s outer surface.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4873"><sup>96</sup> The meaning of which is, put the bells between the pomegranates.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4874"><sup>97</sup> See verse 29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4875"><sup>98</sup> What purpose is there to gold plating a bar that is inserted into a board.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4876"><sup>99</sup> On the northwest and southwest corners of the tabernacle. For the corner boards see verse 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4877"><sup>100</sup> These two corner boards were set up first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4878"><sup>101</sup> In verse 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4879"><sup>102</sup> The tabernacle courtyard had four corner poles. Two of them were set up first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4880"><sup>103</sup> Like the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4881"><sup>104</sup> All the boards of the tabernacle were 1 1/2 cubits in width. These two boards were a little more than half a cubit. See note 108.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4882"><sup>105</sup> Scripture discusses these boards apart from the other boards.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4883"><sup>106</sup> Western boards.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4884"><sup>107</sup> Between the two corner boards.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4885"><sup>108</sup> The six boards came to 9 cubits. Each one of the corner boards came to a little more than half a cubit. A half cubit of open space and a little more to cover the width of the boards made up the northern and southern walls of the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4886"><sup>109</sup> Since these boards were not the same size as the other boards, it is possible that they were likewise not shaped like them. In fact, being corner boards they might have been round.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4887"><sup>110</sup> To cover. See note 108.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4888"><sup>111</sup> It is hard to ascertain what I.E. means by this. According to Rashi the corner boards did stand in a straight line with the other six boards. Filwarg writes, &#x201C;I cannot explain this.&#x201D; Sarim similarly comments, &#x201C;I did not find any scholar or commentary that explains I.E.&#x2019;s language.&#x201D; Meijler suggests that what I.E. means by &#x201C;these boards did not stand in a straight line&#x201D; is that the corner boards did not serve the same purpose as the other six boards. For the other six boards served to cover the inside of the tabernacle while most of the surface of the corner boards served to cover the northern and southern boards.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4889"><sup>112</sup> That is, because only half a cubit was inside of the tabernacle. According to Rashi, who accepts the Talmudic tradition that the boards were a cubit in thickness, the two outer boards like all the other boards were 1 1/2 cubits in width. One half a cubit of each one of the corner boards filled the remaining open spaces left over after the six boards were placed on the western side of the tabernacle (see note 108). See Rashi on verse 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4890"><sup>113</sup> In other words, there is no way that a board measuring 1 1/2 cubits can be squeezed into a space measuring half a cubit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4891"><sup>114</sup> After setting up the western wall of the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4892"><sup>115</sup> Of the western wall (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4893"><sup>116</sup> On the eastern side of the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4894"><sup>117</sup> That is, from underneath the fabric curtain which is referred to as the tabernacle. See I.E. on verse 15 and the notes thereto. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that when the fabric curtains, which measured 44 by 28 cubits, were sewn together and placed over the tabernacle, which measured 30 by 10 cubits, 10 of the 44 cubits covered the back of the tabernacle, an undetermined amount covered the thickness of the boards of the western wall, and what remained covered the top of the tabernacle. An amount of space equivalent to the thickness of the western wall was thus left uncovered on the eastern side of the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4895"><sup>118</sup> That is, each one of the five pillars that served as supports for the <italic>screen of the door for the Tent</italic>. See verse 36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4896"><sup>119</sup> That is, under it, i.e., under the exposed area. For the pillars for the <italic>screen for the door of the Tent</italic> stood at the very entrance to the tent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4897"><sup>120</sup> Which hung over the front of the tent. See verse 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4898"><sup>121</sup> That is, covered the exposed area.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4899"><sup>122</sup> In other words, <italic>And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle</italic> means: and thou shalt command the wise-hearted to rear up the tabernacle. I.E. comments thus because it was impossible for Moses himself to rear up the tabernacle. Concerning who the wise-hearted are see Ex. 36:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4900"><sup>123</sup> And the others then joined in.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4901"><sup>124</sup> In other words, <italic>And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle</italic> means, and thou shalt begin to rear up the tabernacle.</ftnote>

<p>[AND THE HEIGHT THEREOF SHALL BE THREE CUBITS.] Look, if contrary to the opinion of our sages,<sup><xref rid="fn4924">4</xref></sup> we say that there was no need for a ramp<sup><xref rid="fn4925">5</xref></sup> because the altar was three cubits high,<sup><xref rid="fn4926">6</xref></sup> what then will the opponents of the sages<sup><xref rid="fn4927">7</xref></sup> do with the altar which Solomon made? That altar was ten cubits high<sup><xref rid="fn4928">8</xref></sup> whereas the height of a person is only four cubits.</p>
<p>[FOUR-SQUARE.] Scripture describes the altar as being <italic>ravu&#x2019;a</italic> (four-square) because the length of the altar was the same as its width.<sup><xref rid="fn4929">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. CORNERS. The word <italic>pinnot</italic> means corners.</p>
<p>3. [TO TAKE AWAY ITS ASHES.] The meaning of <italic>ledasheno</italic> is, to take away its ashes. The meaning of <italic>yedasheneh</italic> (accept the fat) in <italic>And accept the fat of thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah</italic> (Ps. 20:4) is, he shall make ashes out of it.<sup><xref rid="fn4930">10</xref></sup> Its meaning is that the sacrifice will be burnt on the altar and accepted.<sup><xref rid="fn4931">11</xref></sup> Observe the word <italic>tedashen</italic> (make fat) in <italic>maketh the bones fat</italic> (Prov. 15:30).

<p>AND ITS SHOVELS. The word <italic>ve-ya&#x2019;av</italic> (and its shovels) is similar to the word <italic>ve-ya&#x2019;ah</italic> (shall sweep away) in <italic>And the hail shall sweep away</italic> (Is. 28:17).<sup><xref rid="fn4935">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>4. A GRATING. The word <italic>mikhbar</italic> (a grating) is similar in meaning to the word <italic>kevarah</italic> (sieve) (Amos 9:9).</p>
<p>BRASS. The word <italic>brass</italic> (nechoshet) is connected [to the word <italic>grating</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn4940">20</xref></sup> The text should be interpreted as if it read, a grating of brass, constructed like a net.<sup><xref rid="fn4941">21</xref></sup></p>

The verse is similar to the aphorism, a head without a brain.</p>
<p>The laver<sup><xref rid="fn4943">23</xref></sup> is not mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn4944">24</xref></sup> because it<sup><xref rid="fn4945">25</xref></sup> was not made from the gifts which were donated by all of Israel.

<p>SOUTHWARD. The word <italic>temanah</italic> (southward)<sup><xref rid="fn4957">37</xref></sup> comes from the same root as <italic>yamin</italic> (south). Compare, <italic>The north and the south</italic> (yamin), <italic>Thou hast created them</italic> (Ps. 89:13).</p>
<p>10. [AND THEIR FILLETS.] The meaning of <italic>chashukehem</italic> (their fillets) is their attachments, the hooks being attached to the pillars.<sup><xref rid="fn4958">38</xref></sup> <italic>Va-tidbak nafsho</italic> (and his soul did cleave) (Gen. 34:3) means the same as <italic>chashekah nafsho</italic> (his soul longeth) (Gen. 34:8).<sup><xref rid="fn4959">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND FOR THE BREADTH&#x2026;FIFTY CUBITS. The width of the courtyard was thus half of its length.<sup><xref rid="fn4960">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries tell us that the tabernacle was placed fifty cubits westward.<sup><xref rid="fn4961">41</xref></sup> Now its width was fifty cubits. This is what <italic>and the breadth fifty every where</italic> (v. 18) means. However, I believe that the meaning of <italic>the breadth fifty every where</italic> is that the courtyard was a right-angled parallelogram,<sup><xref rid="fn4962">42</xref></sup> and its width was fifty cubits on all sides.<sup><xref rid="fn4963">43</xref></sup> There is no necessity to explain <italic>the breadth fifty every where</italic> as referring to the side of the courtyard,<sup><xref rid="fn4964">44</xref></sup> as Scripture does not repeat the dimensions length by width as it normally does.<sup><xref rid="fn4965">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. ALL. The meaning of <italic>All the instruments of the tabernacle</italic> is, all the instruments that were for the use of the tabernacle. The pins of the tent<sup><xref rid="fn4966">46</xref></sup> and the pins of the court were of brass. So were the hammers.<sup><xref rid="fn4967">47</xref></sup></p>
<h1>TETZAVVEH</h1>
<p align="blockquote">If your heart desires to know the truth</p>
<p align="blockquote">Look at the body,</p>
<p align="blockquote">And consider the most glorious thing in it.<sup><xref rid="fn4968">48</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">I will secretly reveal the mystery of the Urim and Thummim</p>
<p align="blockquote">In the Torah portion entitled, <italic>And Thou Shalt Command</italic>.</p>
<p>20. AND THOU SHALT COMMAND. I will first note the reason for the position of this Torah portion.<sup><xref rid="fn4969">49</xref></sup> After God finished enumerating all the holy utensils, the veil, the tabernacle, the tent, the cover, the altar of the burnt offering, the courtyard, and the screen,<sup><xref rid="fn4970">50</xref></sup> He commenced<sup><xref rid="fn4971">51</xref></sup> to deal with those who ministered in the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn4972">52</xref></sup> He explained the service which they alone were to perform. No stranger was permitted to perform the service alongside them. God opened<sup><xref rid="fn4973">53</xref></sup> with the command that they<sup><xref rid="fn4974">54</xref></sup> cause a lamp to burn using pure olive oil. They were not to employ any other oil. It is only fitting that those who ministered in the tabernacle were to be distinguished and set apart, both in family and in dress.<sup><xref rid="fn4975">55</xref></sup> Scripture lists the garments one after the other.<sup><xref rid="fn4976">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture then mentions that those who served in the tabernacle were obligated to learn the service during the seven days of consecration. Moses was to teach and train them. After this, the priests would serve in the tabernacle. They would offer the daily burnt offering on the altar of the burnt offering. They were not to offer it upon the golden altar. The priests were to offer only incense upon the golden altar and to make atonement upon its horns once a year.<sup><xref rid="fn4977">57</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>And thou shalt command</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn4978">58</xref></sup> means that there is an eternal command upon the congregation to continually provide olive oil to kindle a perpetual light. Do not be troubled by the oil which the princes<sup><xref rid="fn4979">59</xref></sup> brought.<sup><xref rid="fn4980">60</xref></sup> It was anointing oil.<sup><xref rid="fn4981">61</xref></sup> The congregation, on the other hand, was obligated to bring oil for the light.</p>
<p>There is a practice in countries where olives grow to choose pure olives, that is, olives that do not have any rot on them or olives that have not been partially eaten. These olives are then used to make oil for the king&#x2019;s food. This is the reason that Scripture mentions <italic>pure</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4982">62</xref></sup> before <italic>beaten</italic>.</p>
<p>FOR THE LIGHT. For the light needed during the night.<sup><xref rid="fn4983">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO CAUSE A LAMP TO BURN. To kindle the lamps.<sup><xref rid="fn4984">64</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>that they should burn</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4985">65</xref></sup><italic>according to the ordinance</italic> (II Chron. 4:20) concerning Solomon&#x2019;s candelabra.<sup><xref rid="fn4986">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>[CONTINUALLY.] The meaning of <italic>tamid</italic> (continually) is nightly.<sup><xref rid="fn4987">67</xref></sup> There is a more difficult usage of the term <italic>tamid</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn4988">68</xref></sup> namely, <italic>and it shall be always</italic> (tamid) <italic>upon his forehead</italic> (Ex. 28:38).<sup><xref rid="fn4989">69</xref></sup> The meaning of the latter is that the holy plate shall always be upon the miter whenever the miter is placed upon the head of the high priest.<sup><xref rid="fn4990">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. WHICH IS BEFORE THE TESTIMONY. <italic>The testimony</italic> is short for the ark of testimony.</p>
<p>Yefet says that <italic>ya&#x2019;arokh</italic> (shall set)<sup><xref rid="fn4991">71</xref></sup> is similar in meaning to <italic>ke-erkekha</italic> (as thou valuest it)<sup><xref rid="fn4992">72</xref></sup> in <italic>as thou the priest valuest it</italic> (Lev. 27:12). It means that the priest shall estimate the amount of oil that will be sufficient for the lamps to give light from evening till morning.<sup><xref rid="fn4993">73</xref></sup> The same applies to the phrase <italic>nerot ha-ma&#x2019;arakha</italic> (even the lamps to be set in order) (Ex. 39:37).<sup><xref rid="fn4994">74</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Ya&#x2019;arokh</italic> may also be properly interpreted as meaning shall set, for the lamps were set in a semicircle.<sup><xref rid="fn4995">75</xref></sup> I will yet speak on this.</p>
<ftnote id="fn4921"><sup>1</sup> Reading <italic>be-emet</italic>, as in <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. The printed texts contain <italic>ba-amah</italic>. If we read <italic>ba-amah</italic>, then the meaning of the sentence is: it was square by cubits; that is, it was 5 cubits long and 5 cubits wide. Many of the commentaries suggest emending the text to <italic>be-emet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4922"><sup>2</sup> Literally, for squares come in five shapes. I.E. refers to quadrilaterals as squares.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4923"><sup>3</sup> Squares, rectangles, parallelograms, rhombuses, and trapezoids.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4924"><sup>4</sup> According to sages of the Talmud the altar was ascended via a ramp. See <italic>Mishnah Middot</italic> 5:2. Also see <italic>Mekhilta, Yitro</italic> 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4925"><sup>5</sup> To ascend the altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4926"><sup>6</sup> A priest does not have to ascend in order to perform the service on a threecubit high altar. The priest can stand next to the altar and offer the sacrifices. As I.E. points out, the height of an average person is 4 cubits. It should be noted that according to the Talmudic sage Rabbi Judah, the altar was 3 cubits high above the ledge which went all around the altar, and the entire altar was 10 cubits in height. See <italic>Zevachim</italic> 59b. Also see Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4927"><sup>7</sup> Who maintain that the altar had no ramp. It should be noted that the Pentateuch does not mention that the altar had a ramp.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4928"><sup>8</sup> See II Chron. 4:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4929"><sup>9</sup> The altar was 3 cubits in height. Hence I.E. comments that the altar was only square with regard to its length and width. This comment is found in <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38, in Weiser, and in some other editions. It is omitted by most <italic>mikra&#x2019;ot gedolot</italic> editions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4930"><sup>10</sup> According to I.E., Ps. 20:4 should be rendered: and make ashes out of your burnt offerings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4931"><sup>11</sup> By God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4932"><sup>12</sup> Our texts read, to a different form. However, this reading is impossible, as <italic>le-dasheno, yedasheneh</italic>, and <italic>tedashen</italic> are all <italic>pi&#x2019;els</italic>. Hence the commentaries suggest emending <italic>acher</italic> (different) to <italic>echad</italic> (one or same). See Filwarg, Krinsky, and Weiser. It should be noted that the <italic>Margoli&#x2019;ot Tuvah</italic> edition of I.E. reads <italic>echad</italic> rather than <italic>acher</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4933"><sup>13</sup> Although their meaning differs. I.E. points out that the root <italic>dalet, shin, nun</italic> in the <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic> form can have a number of meanings: to take away ashes, to turn into ashes, and to fatten.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4934"><sup>14</sup> Gen. 49:20 is not a proof text, as the word <italic>deshen</italic> does not appear in it. I.E. merely uses it in order to define the word <italic>tedasheno</italic>. I.E. literally reads: <italic>tedashen</italic> has the same meaning as, <italic>As for Asher, his bread shall be fat</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4935"><sup>15</sup> According to I.E., <italic>ve-ya&#x2019;av</italic> literally means: and its sweepers. He probably rendered <italic>ve-ya&#x2019;av</italic> as: and its brushes, or, and its scrapers. See Krinsky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4936"><sup>16</sup> Literally, to all. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4937"><sup>17</sup> It has no meaning. It is not to be translated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4938"><sup>18</sup> For <italic>le-min</italic> is to be translated as if written <italic>min</italic> (from).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4939"><sup>19</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4940"><sup>20</sup> Not to <italic>reshet</italic> (network), which precedes it, for <italic>reshet</italic> (network) is connected to <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh</italic>, not to <italic>nechoshet</italic>. Our verse, which reads, <italic>mikhbar ma&#x2019;aseh reshet nechoshet</italic> (a grating of network of brass) is to be interpreted as if written: <italic>mikhbar nechoshet ma&#x2019;aseh reshet</italic> (a grating of brass, of network).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4941"><sup>21</sup> So too Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4942"><sup>22</sup> That is, Onkelos. Onkelos renders <italic>nevuv luchot</italic> as <italic>chalil luche</italic> (hollow with planks).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4943"><sup>23</sup> See Ex. 30:17-21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4944"><sup>24</sup> In this Torah portion. However, <italic>prima facie</italic>, it should have been mentioned, as it was made right after the altar. See Ex. 38:1-8 (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4945"><sup>25</sup> Unlike the objects mentioned in our Torah portion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4946"><sup>26</sup> See Ex. 38:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4947"><sup>27</sup> Ex. 30:22-28. The chapter dealing with the laver precedes the chapter dealing with the spices.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4948"><sup>28</sup> See Ex. 35:27,28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4949"><sup>29</sup> In speaking of the east, Scripture in verse 13 uses the phrase <italic>kedemah mizrachah</italic>. Now since both <italic>kedem</italic> and <italic>mizrach</italic> mean east, Scripture should have read <italic>kedemah</italic> or <italic>mizrachah</italic>. The question thus arises, why did Scripture employ the phrase <italic>kedemah mizrachah</italic>? I.E. brings up this issue here since Scripture uses the phrase <italic>negev temanah</italic> (south&#x2026;southwards). Here too the question arises, why employ the phrase <italic>negev temanah</italic> when both <italic>negev</italic> and <italic>teman</italic> mean south?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4950"><sup>30</sup> The eastern sky is divided into three sections. Each section is called a &#x201C;head.&#x201D; The sun rises at various places in the eastern sky at different times of the year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4951"><sup>31</sup> The eastern sky consists of the constellations Aries, Taurus, and Gemini. The northern sky consists of Cancer, Leo, and Virgo. The western sky consists of Libra, Scorpio, and Sagittarius. The southern sky consists of Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Capricorn is located in the southwestern section of the heavens. Aries lies in the southeastern part of the sky. The first &#x201C;head&#x201D; of the east begins at a point in the southeastern sky directly opposite the constellation of Capricorn.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4952"><sup>32</sup> Head of the east.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4953"><sup>33</sup> The celestial equator extends from Aries to Libra.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4954"><sup>34</sup> The term <italic>kedemah mizrachah</italic> refers to the middle portion of the eastern sky. So Krinsky. I.E. comments thus because in his opinion the tabernacle corresponded to the heavens. Thus <italic>kedemah mizrachah</italic> corresponded to a certain portion of the heavens. Weiser claims that <italic>kedemah mizrachah</italic> refers to the entire eastern side.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4955"><sup>35</sup> Which our verse employs. Actually our verse reads, <italic>negev temanah</italic>. I.E. used the term <italic>negbah temanah</italic> because verse 18 reads <italic>kedemah mizrachah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4956"><sup>36</sup> The southern part of the sky also has three &#x201C;heads.&#x201D; The phrase <italic>negbah temanah</italic> refers to the middle portion of the southern sky. So Krinsky. For other interpretations see Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4957"><sup>37</sup> That is, the word <italic>teman</italic> (south).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4958"><sup>38</sup> The fillets, like the hooks, were attached to the pillars. See Rashi: &#x201C;The pillars were encompassed by threads of silver round about.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4959"><sup>39</sup> The Bible first says <italic>va-tidbak nafsho</italic>. It then repeats the same account. However, in the latter it employs <italic>chashekah nafsho</italic> in place of <italic>va-tidbak nafsho</italic>. We thus see that <italic>davak</italic> and <italic>chashak</italic> have the same meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4960"><sup>40</sup> The courtyard was 100 cubits long.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4961"><sup>41</sup> From the eastern wall of the courtyard. See <italic>Eruvin</italic> 23b. &#x201C;He placed the tabernacle (which measured 30 by 20 cubits) at the edge of fifty cubits (i.e., 50 cubits inwards) so that there was fifty cubits in front of the tabernacle and twenty cubits around the sides.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4962"><sup>42</sup> Hebrew, <italic>me-rov orekh zavyotav nitzavot</italic>. Literally, because of its many long right angles. In other words, the courtyard was a parallelogram that measured 50 cubits in width. Such a structure is 50 cubits in breadth <italic>every where</italic>, i.e., all along its width. Meijler suggests emending <italic>me-rov orekh zavyotav nitzavot</italic> (because of the length of its many angles) to <italic>meruva orekh zavyotav nitzavot</italic> (a right-angled parallelogram). <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 reads: <italic>merchav arokh zeviyot</italic>, which means a right-angled parallelogram. This reading seems to be the most correct. Be that as it may, according to I.E. the import of our verse is that the tabernacle courtyard was not tapered but measured 100 by 50 cubits.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4963"><sup>43</sup> For the meaning of <italic>the breadth fifty every where</italic> is that its width did not vary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4964"><sup>44</sup> That is, the eastern side of the courtyard (Filwarg). I.E. takes issue with the rabbis who held that the courtyard on the east side of the tabernacle was a 50 by 50-cubit square, as the tabernacle was placed 50 cubits inwards from the eastern wall of the courtyard. See note 41. See I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary. Also see Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4965"><sup>45</sup> Verse 18 reads, <italic>chamishim ba-chamishim</italic> (fifty every where). If Scripture were speaking of a square it would read, <italic>chamishim al chamishim</italic> (fifty by fifty) (Filwarg). Also see Weiser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4966"><sup>46</sup> In other words, <italic>and all the pins thereof</italic> refers to the pins of the tent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4967"><sup>47</sup> Which were used to bang the pins in the ground (Weiser). The hammers are not mentioned in the text.

<ftnote id="fn4968"><sup>48</sup> The soul (Krinsky). In other words, develop your soul and you will learn the truth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4969"><sup>49</sup> Why the Torah portion <italic>Tetzavveh</italic> follows the Torah portion <italic>Terumah</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4979"><sup>59</sup> See Ex. 35:27,28.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4980"><sup>60</sup> This indicates that the oil is brought by the individual rather than by the congregation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4981"><sup>61</sup> Rather than oil for the light. However, Scripture explicitly states that the princes brought oil <italic>for the light, and for the anointing oil</italic> (Ex. 35:28). Krinsky explains that only the princes had pure olive oil in the desert (see I.E. on Ex. 35:27). Hence after the princes donated the oil to be used for anointing oil, some of it was utilized for the light.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4982"><sup>62</sup> Pure refers to the olives, not to the oil. According to I.E. our verse should be interpreted as follows: that they bring unto thee olive oil, from pure olives beaten for the light.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4983"><sup>63</sup> I.E. interprets <italic>la-ma&#x2019;or</italic> (for the light) as: needed for the light. He then elaborates: needed for the light at night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4984"><sup>64</sup> <italic>Le-ha&#x2019;alot ner</italic> (to cause a lamp to burn) literally means to cause a lamp to go up.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4985"><sup>65</sup> Hebrew, <italic>le-va&#x2019;aram</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4986"><sup>66</sup> In other words, the use of the term <italic>le-va&#x2019;aram</italic> with regard to Solomon&#x2019;s candelabra shows that <italic>le-ha&#x2019;alot</italic> used in connection with Moses&#x2019; menorah means to kindle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4987"><sup>67</sup> For the menorah did not burn continually. The word <italic>tamid</italic> means continually. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4988"><sup>68</sup> That is, a use of the term which presents us with greater problems than the one in our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4989"><sup>69</sup> For the Bible explicitly states that the holy plate shall always be on the high priest&#x2019;s head. However, in our verse the phrase <italic>ner tamid</italic> is merely descriptive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4990"><sup>70</sup> In other words, <italic>always</italic> means whenever the miter is worn by the high priest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4991"><sup>71</sup> From the root <italic>ayin, resh, kaf</italic>. This root can mean to estimate or to arrange. Hence the two interpretations of <italic>ya&#x2019;arokh</italic> (shall set).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4993"><sup>73</sup> In other words, <italic>ya&#x2019;arokh</italic> (shall set) means shall estimate.</ftnote>

<p>1. AND BRING THOU. Scripture says, <italic>And bring thou near unto thee</italic> [<italic>Aaron thy brother, and his sons&#x2026;that they may minister unto me</italic>] because at first Moses was the high priest.<sup><xref rid="fn4996">1</xref></sup> I have already hinted<sup><xref rid="fn4997">2</xref></sup> at why Aaron<sup><xref rid="fn4998">3</xref></sup> was chosen to be sanctified to the Lord so that the priests<sup><xref rid="fn4999">4</xref></sup> would make atonement for Israel. Aaron was chosen because of the importance of Nahshon&#x2019;s family.<sup><xref rid="fn5000">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>We cannot find fault with Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn5001">6</xref></sup> our master, as Moses was a fugitive.<sup><xref rid="fn5002">7</xref></sup> Who would have given him a Hebrew woman?<sup><xref rid="fn5003">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, the burden of all of Israel was upon Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn5004">9</xref></sup> Moses had to teach Israel the commandments.

<p>[THAT THEY MAY MINISTER UNTO ME.] The <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>lekhahano</italic> (that they minister) in <italic>that they may minister unto me</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn5006">11</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>chayeto</italic> (beast)<sup><xref rid="fn5007">12</xref></sup> in <italic>every beast of the field</italic> (Ps. 104:11) and <italic>beno</italic> (son of)<sup><xref rid="fn5008">13</xref></sup> in <italic>the son of Beor</italic> (Num. 24:3).</p>
<p>Our verse lists the sons of Aaron.

<p>2. AND THOU SHALT MAKE HOLY GARMENTS. They are called holy garments because they were worn during the sanctuary service.

<p>The garments of Aaron referred to in our verse are the ones which Scripture later enumerates.<sup><xref rid="fn5012">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>3. AND THOU SHALT. The <italic>vav</italic> in <italic>milletiv</italic> (I have filled)<sup><xref rid="fn5014">19</xref></sup> refers to <italic>lev</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn5015">20</xref></sup> (hearted).<sup><xref rid="fn5016">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND THESE ARE THE GARMENTS. Scripture first mentions the breastplate, which was worn over the ephod, which was worn over the robe.<sup><xref rid="fn5017">22</xref></sup> It then mentions the tunic and the girdle<sup><xref rid="fn5018">23</xref></sup> which went around it<sup><xref rid="fn5019">24</xref></sup> after the mitre was placed on Aaron&#x2019;s head. This is what happened<sup><xref rid="fn5020">25</xref></sup> when Aaron washed<sup><xref rid="fn5021">26</xref></sup> and put on linen breeches.<sup><xref rid="fn5022">27</xref></sup> However, there was no reason to mention the breeches here nor in the description of the actual investiture of Aaron,<sup><xref rid="fn5023">28</xref></sup> for it is the manner of all men to wear breeches. Now Moses put the tunic upon Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn5024">29</xref></sup> He then placed the mitre upon Aaron&#x2019;s head,<sup><xref rid="fn5025">30</xref></sup> and He placed &#x201C;the plate of the holy crown&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn5026">31</xref></sup> upon the mitre.<sup><xref rid="fn5027">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our verse, which enumerates the priestly garments, does not mention &#x201C;the plate of the holy crown&#x201D; because &#x201C;the plate of the holy crown&#x201D; was not a garment. However, our sages mentioned the holy plate among the priestly garments<sup><xref rid="fn5028">33</xref></sup> because most of the objects worn by the high priest were garments. Hence the sages speak of the eight garments worn by the high priest. The Urim and Thummim<sup><xref rid="fn5029">34</xref></sup> were not garments.<sup><xref rid="fn5030">35</xref></sup> Neither were the stones,<sup><xref rid="fn5031">36</xref></sup> nor the cards.<sup><xref rid="fn5032">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>After this<sup><xref rid="fn5033">38</xref></sup> Moses encircled Aaron with the girdle. Moses then placed the robe upon Aaron. He then placed the ephod upon the robe and <italic>put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod and bound it unto him therewith</italic> (Lev. 8:7).<sup><xref rid="fn5034">39</xref></sup> The skillfully woven band was part of the ephod.<sup><xref rid="fn5035">40</xref></sup> The ephod was so called because of the skillfully woven band.<sup><xref rid="fn5036">41</xref></sup> Moses dressed Aaron according to the order described in our verse.</p>
<p>Do not be bothered by the fact that Scripture later states, regarding the actual investiture of Aaron, <italic>And he set the mitre upon his head</italic> (Lev. 8:9).<sup><xref rid="fn5037">42</xref></sup> Its meaning is, he had already placed the mitre with the golden plate on Aaron&#x2019;s head when he dressed him in the tunic.<sup><xref rid="fn5038">43</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>and clothed him with garments</italic> (Zech. 3:5) is similar; i.e., they had already clothed him. For Scripture previously states, <italic>So they set a fair mitre upon his head</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).<sup><xref rid="fn5039">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THEY SHALL TAKE THE GOLD. The wise-hearted who made the priestly garments were trustworthy.<sup><xref rid="fn5040">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>[6. AND THEY SHALL MAKE THE EPHOD.] Scripture starts with the ephod<sup><xref rid="fn5041">46</xref></sup> because it was larger than the breastplate. The Torah tells us <italic>that the breastplate be not loosed from</italic> the skilfully woven band of <italic>the ephod</italic> (v. 28).<sup><xref rid="fn5042">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are some very difficult questions relating to the ephod and the breastplate. Moses only made one ephod.<sup><xref rid="fn5043">48</xref></sup> However, Scripture states, <italic>that he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5044">49</xref></sup> <italic>came down with an ephod in his hand</italic> (I Sam. 23:6). The latter does not refer to the ephod made by Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn5045">50</xref></sup> for Scripture does not read &#x201C;the ephod,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn5046">51</xref></sup> the meaning of which is, the well-known ephod,<sup><xref rid="fn5047">52</xref></sup> as it does when it states, <italic>&#x201C;Bring hither the ephod&#x201D;</italic> (I Sam. 23:9).<sup><xref rid="fn5048">53</xref></sup> Furthermore, why does Scripture state, <italic>he came down</italic>, but it does not say he brought down? It thus appears that the ephod was accidentally among his possessions.<sup><xref rid="fn5049">54</xref></sup> Additionally, Scripture there states, <italic>fourscore persons</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5050">55</xref></sup> <italic>that did wear a linen</italic> (bad) <italic>ephod</italic> (I Sam. 22:18).<sup><xref rid="fn5051">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many commentaries explain this verse as meaning that the <italic>persons</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5052">57</xref></sup> were fit to wear the ephod.<sup><xref rid="fn5053">58</xref></sup> However, they did not bother to learn the truth.<sup><xref rid="fn5054">59</xref></sup> A <italic>bad</italic> (linen) ephod is an ephod made from a type of flax. However, the ephod made by Moses was not made of <italic>bad</italic> (linen).<sup><xref rid="fn5055">60</xref></sup> It was made of gold, blue wool, purple wool, and scarlet, with <italic>shesh</italic> (linen)<sup><xref rid="fn5056">61</xref></sup> intertwined with all of the aforementioned.<sup><xref rid="fn5057">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>They only inquired of the breastplate of judgment which had the Urim and Thummim upon it.<sup><xref rid="fn5058">63</xref></sup> Scripture similarly writes, <italic>by the judgment of the Urim before the Lord</italic> (Num. 27:21). <italic>Bring hither the ephod</italic> (I Sam. 23:9)<sup><xref rid="fn5059">64</xref></sup> does not present a counterargument<sup><xref rid="fn5060">65</xref></sup> because the breastplate was connected to it. The Urim<sup><xref rid="fn5061">66</xref></sup> went along with the breastplate.<sup><xref rid="fn5062">67</xref></sup> We similarly read, <italic>till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim</italic> (Neh. 7:65). Scripture likewise states, <italic>Thy Thummim and Thy Urim</italic> (Deut. 33:8).</p>
<p>Now, Scripture tells us<sup><xref rid="fn5063">68</xref></sup> that God answered David through Abiathar&#x2019;s ephod.<sup><xref rid="fn5064">69</xref></sup> However, we also read that when Saul went to war he inquired of the Urim (I Sam. 28:6). These were the very Urim that were placed in the breastplate of judgment which was with the ephod<sup><xref rid="fn5065">70</xref></sup> and the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn5066">71</xref></sup> However, David inquired of Abiathar&#x2019;s ephod in Ziklag. Abiathar&#x2019;s ephod was thus not Moses&#x2019; ephod.<sup><xref rid="fn5067">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following problem is even more difficult.<sup><xref rid="fn5068">73</xref></sup> It is clear that the Urim do not refer to the stones of the breastplate,<sup><xref rid="fn5069">74</xref></sup> as Scripture openly states, <italic>And thou shalt set in it settings of stones</italic> (v. 17). The setting of the stones was the work of a stonecutter and not the work of Moses. God then told Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn5070">75</xref></sup> <italic>And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim</italic> (v. 30).<sup><xref rid="fn5071">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture, in describing the making of the breastplate,<sup><xref rid="fn5072">77</xref></sup> tells us, <italic>And they set in it four rows of stones</italic> (Ex. 39:10). Scripture then describes the four rows of stones.<sup><xref rid="fn5073">78</xref></sup> Scripture tells us that Moses placed the breastplate upon Aaron <italic>and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim</italic> (Lev. 8:8). Now according to the plain meaning of the text the stones were not the objects that enlightened or fulfilled,<sup><xref rid="fn5074">79</xref></sup> because inquiries were made of the Urim and Thummim.</p>
<p>We do not know what they were. The explanation that the names of the tribes<sup><xref rid="fn5075">80</xref></sup> and the patriarchs<sup><xref rid="fn5076">81</xref></sup> were inscribed on the breastplate is of no help,<sup><xref rid="fn5077">82</xref></sup> for the breastplate of judgment was so called only because of the Urim that were on it.<sup><xref rid="fn5078">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is an additional question: we cannot identify the Urim with the Thummim,<sup><xref rid="fn5079">84</xref></sup> for Scripture states, <italic>with Urim and Thummim</italic> (Neh. 7:65). Furthermore, the words <italic>with Urim</italic> and <italic>Thummim</italic> are in the plural. They thus consisted of many objects.<sup><xref rid="fn5080">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Solomon says that the Urim and Thummim consisted of an inscription of God&#x2019;s explicit name.<sup><xref rid="fn5081">86</xref></sup> However, he would not have said this had he seen the responsa of Rabbi Hai Gaon.<sup><xref rid="fn5082">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a very deep secret behind the ephod and the breastplate. I will allude only to a part of this secret. Perhaps he who knows the mind of the Most High will understand it. The following are the keys to the secret of the ephod.<sup><xref rid="fn5083">88</xref></sup> The two wreathen chains on the two rings [represent the head of Aries and Libra].<sup><xref rid="fn5084">89</xref></sup> The band of the ephod represents the celestial equator.<sup><xref rid="fn5085">90</xref></sup> Hence six names were inscribed on the stone which was on the other shoulder.<sup><xref rid="fn5086">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now these things<sup><xref rid="fn5087">92</xref></sup> can only be grasped by the mind. Hence six names were inscribed on one stone<sup><xref rid="fn5088">93</xref></sup> in accordance with the number, names, and order of birth of the tribes of the children of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn5089">94</xref></sup> Six names were similarly inscribed on the second stone.<sup><xref rid="fn5090">95</xref></sup> On the other hand, the names on the breastplate were not divided in the same manner as they are grasped by the mind.<sup><xref rid="fn5091">96</xref></sup> They were divided in a way that could be perceived by the eye.<sup><xref rid="fn5092">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture states, <italic>And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a thread of blue</italic> (v. 28) to prevent the breastplate from moving to the side.<sup><xref rid="fn5093">98</xref></sup> The breastplate was folded, for the Urim and Thummim were kept there until such time as they were needed. They were then placed outside of the breastplate.<sup><xref rid="fn5094">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note, the stones of the ephod were like each other.<sup><xref rid="fn5095">100</xref></sup> They were of one color.<sup><xref rid="fn5096">101</xref></sup> This was not the case with the stones of the breastplate,<sup><xref rid="fn5097">102</xref></sup> for the sapphire stones<sup><xref rid="fn5098">103</xref></sup> served as a memorial,<sup><xref rid="fn5099">104</xref></sup> while the judgment of the children of Israel was upon the stones of the breastplate.<sup><xref rid="fn5100">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word Urim is related to the word <italic>ur</italic> (fire) in <italic>I am warm, I have seen the fire</italic> (Is. 44:16).<sup><xref rid="fn5101">106</xref></sup> The Thummim are so called because they are whole.<sup><xref rid="fn5102">107</xref></sup> The Urim were of gold and silver. This was not the case with the Thummim.<sup><xref rid="fn5103">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>The [importance of the] number [twelve] has been established by irrefutable proof from the upper and lower worlds.<sup><xref rid="fn5104">109</xref></sup> The intelligent will understand what I say.<sup><xref rid="fn5105">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the priests had many ephodim. They all had bands. However, they lacked the breastplate and the Urim. A priest who was an expert in using the Urim and Thummim was able to respond to an inquirer because the ephod at hand resembled [the ephod made by Moses].<sup><xref rid="fn5106">111</xref></sup> However, the priest did not always get an answer.<sup><xref rid="fn5107">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now if I wanted to even begin to reveal this secret<sup><xref rid="fn5108">113</xref></sup> it would take up more space than the entire commentary which I have composed on this book. For only an individual who has studied works on geometry and the secret of the way the sky works can understand the secret of the ephod. There is no need to expand on the form of the ephod, the breastplate, and the rings.</p>
<p>[9.] ONYX STONES. The <italic>avne shoham</italic> (onyx stones) were white. They are called <italic>burla</italic> in Aramaic and <italic>balor</italic> in Arabic.</p>
<p>We have no way to positively identify the stones that were set in the breastplate. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon translated them<sup><xref rid="fn5109">114</xref></sup> as he saw fit, as he had no tradition to rely upon.<sup><xref rid="fn5110">115</xref></sup> We read the Gaon&#x2019;s translation and noticed that he rendered <italic>sappir</italic> (sapphire) as white.<sup><xref rid="fn5111">116</xref></sup> However, this is not the case. <italic>Sappir</italic> is red.<sup><xref rid="fn5112">117</xref></sup> The fact that the first stone<sup><xref rid="fn5113">118</xref></sup> mentioned by the Torah was a carnelian<sup><xref rid="fn5114">119</xref></sup> does not refute this,<sup><xref rid="fn5115">120</xref></sup> for there are five visible colors: white, lightning,<sup><xref rid="fn5116">121</xref></sup> red, green, and black. Now since red is the middle color<sup><xref rid="fn5117">122</xref></sup> it comes in various shades.</p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon renders <italic>nofekh</italic> (carbuncle) as black on the basis of <italic>and she painted</italic> (ba-pukh)<sup><xref rid="fn5118">123</xref></sup> <italic>her eyes</italic> (II Kings 9:30).<sup><xref rid="fn5119">124</xref></sup> However, the <italic>nun</italic> in <italic>nofekh</italic> is undoubtedly a root letter,<sup><xref rid="fn5120">125</xref></sup> for <italic>nofekh</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>odem</italic> (carnelian).<sup><xref rid="fn5121">126</xref></sup></p>
<p>A great Sephardic scholar said that <italic>yahalom</italic> (emerald) is a diamond.<sup><xref rid="fn5122">127</xref></sup> This stone has the ability to break up all other stones and to bore through bdellium. <italic>Yahalom</italic> is related to the word <italic>holem</italic> (smiteth) in <italic>smiteth the anvil</italic> (Is. 41:7). The <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>yahalom</italic> is not a root letter.<sup><xref rid="fn5123">128</xref></sup> It is like the <italic>yod</italic> of <italic>yitzhar</italic> (oil).<sup><xref rid="fn5124">129</xref></sup></p>
<p>Also <italic>achlamah</italic> (amethyst) is to be identified with the dream stone.<sup><xref rid="fn5125">130</xref></sup> This is a stone that always induces dreams in the person who wears it.<sup><xref rid="fn5126">131</xref></sup> One should not be surprised at this,<sup><xref rid="fn5127">132</xref></sup> as every stone has a specific power placed in it by nature. Thus there is a stone that attracts iron.<sup><xref rid="fn5128">133</xref></sup> There is likewise a stone that stops bleeding. Another stone is repelled by vinegar. There is also a stone whose pieces always form a triangle when broken.</p>
<p>[14. CHAINS.] The middle root letter has been doubled in <italic>sharsherot</italic> (chains).<sup><xref rid="fn5129">134</xref></sup> However, the word has the same meaning when the middle root letter is not doubled. Compare, <italic>sharshot</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5130">135</xref></sup><italic> gavlut</italic> (plaited chains) (v. 22).</p>
<p>It is very difficult to explain the meaning of <italic>gavlut</italic> (plaited) in Hebrew.<sup><xref rid="fn5131">136</xref></sup> The same applies to many of the words employed by Scripture that refer to the making of the breastplate as well as to the word <italic>choshen</italic> (breastplate) itself.</p>
<p>28. AND THEY SHALL BIND. <italic>Ve-yirkesu</italic> is related to the word <italic>me-rukhse</italic> (from the plottings) in <italic>from the plottings of man</italic> (Ps. 31:21). It means twisted.<sup><xref rid="fn5132">137</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. AND THOU SHALT PUT IN THE BREASTPLATE OF JUDGMENT. Judgment refers to the laws of God and his decrees concerning the future. It is these things that people inquire of the Urim and Thummim.<sup><xref rid="fn5133">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND THOU SHALT MAKE. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon translates the word <italic>me&#x2019;il</italic> (robe) by the Arabic <italic>memtar</italic>, which is a cloak-like<sup><xref rid="fn5134">139</xref></sup> garment except that its opening was in the midst of the robe.<sup><xref rid="fn5135">140</xref></sup> Our sages said that the pomegranates (v. 33) were placed all around the robe. A bell was placed between every two pomegranates.<sup><xref rid="fn5136">141</xref></sup> However, others say that the bells were not visible. They were placed inside the pomegranates, where they rang.<sup><xref rid="fn5137">142</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. AND THOU SHALT MAKE A PLATE. The Gaon renders <italic>tzitz</italic> (plate) <italic>atzabah</italic>. It<sup><xref rid="fn5138">143</xref></sup> was placed on the mitre. It was not shaped like a crown, as the plate<sup><xref rid="fn5139">144</xref></sup> was placed only on the forehead.<sup><xref rid="fn5140">145</xref></sup> According to the plain meaning of the text, the <italic>migba&#x2019;ot</italic> (head-tires) (Lev. 8:13)<sup><xref rid="fn5141">146</xref></sup> were not shaped like the mitre (<italic>mitznefet</italic>). The head-tires are similar to the high hats which men in this and surrounding countries place upon their heads as a head covering.</p>
<p>[37.] THE MITRE. The mitre<sup><xref rid="fn5142">147</xref></sup> is made from long thin material which is twisted only around the head.<sup><xref rid="fn5143">148</xref></sup> The turbans worn by women in these areas are somewhat similar. In Spain, Africa, Egypt, Babylonia, and Baghdad and in the land of the Ishmaelites, only men of respect, not the women, wear turbans on their heads.<sup><xref rid="fn5144">149</xref></sup> The important officials place a golden plate on the turban over the forehead. I have already noted that the ornaments in the Land of Israel and the customs practiced there differ from those in these areas.</p>
<p>Rabbi Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn5145">150</xref></sup> found it necessary to harmonize Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn5146">151</xref></sup> by explaining that three blue threads were attached to the plate.<sup><xref rid="fn5147">152</xref></sup> However, according to the plain meaning of the text only one blue thread<sup><xref rid="fn5148">153</xref></sup> was necessary to keep the plate, which was on the face of the mitre on the forehead, in place.</p>
<p>37. AND THOU SHALT PUT IT ON A THREAD OF BLUE. The meaning of <italic>al petil techelt</italic> (on a thread of blue) is, with<sup><xref rid="fn5149">154</xref></sup> a thread of blue,<sup><xref rid="fn5150">155</xref></sup> as the thread was tied to the plate on two sides.<sup><xref rid="fn5151">156</xref></sup> There is no doubt that the front of the mitre was placed over the forehead.<sup><xref rid="fn5152">157</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn5153">158</xref></sup> was not placed over the head. Scripture elsewhere states, <italic>And they tied unto it a thread of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre</italic> (Ex. 39:31), that is, upon the forehead.<sup><xref rid="fn5154">159</xref></sup></p>
<p>Do not be surprised that Scripture uses the term <italic>al</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5155">160</xref></sup> We find the same<sup><xref rid="fn5156">161</xref></sup> in the following, <italic>And they came, both men with</italic> (al) <italic>women</italic> (Ex. 35:22);<sup><xref rid="fn5157">162</xref></sup><italic>And the priest shall wave them with</italic> (al) <italic>the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before the Lord</italic> (Lev. 23:20); <italic>with</italic> (al) <italic>the two lambs</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.); <italic>the fat with</italic> (al) <italic>the breast</italic> (Lev. 7:30). There are many similar instances in Scripture.</p>
<p>Now you will never find [the mitre and the head-tires interchanging].<sup><xref rid="fn5158">163</xref></sup> For the mitre was set aside only for Aaron, and the head-tires for his children.</p>
<p>Some say that the word <italic>migba&#x2019;ot</italic> (head-tires) is related to the word <italic>givot</italic> (hills) (Gen. 49:26).<sup><xref rid="fn5159">164</xref></sup> The mitre<sup><xref rid="fn5160">165</xref></sup> surrounded and wrapped the head.<sup><xref rid="fn5161">166</xref></sup> We similarly read, <italic>He will violently roll</italic> (tzanof) <italic>and toss thee Like a ball</italic> (yitznofkha tzenefah) (Is. 22:18); <italic>Yea, He will wind thee round and round</italic> (ve-otekha ato) (Is. 22:17).</p>
<p>The one who knows how the mitre is wrapped knows the meaning of [<italic>The mitre shall be removed&#x2026;</italic>] <italic>this shall be no more the same: that which is low shall be exalted, and that which is high abased</italic> (Ezek. 21:31).<sup><xref rid="fn5162">167</xref></sup> It takes a special skill to wind a mitre around the head.</p>
<p>Now Scripture states, <italic>And thou shalt set the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre</italic> (Ex. 29:6). The <italic>tzitz</italic> (plate) (v. 36) is thus called a <italic>nezer</italic> (crown).<sup><xref rid="fn5163">168</xref></sup> <italic>But upon himself shall his crown</italic> (nizro) <italic>shine</italic> (yatzitz) is similar (Ps. 132:18).<sup><xref rid="fn5164">169</xref></sup> Perhaps they all<sup><xref rid="fn5165">170</xref></sup> are used in the sense of <italic>tzitz</italic>, meaning something seen. The same is true with the word <italic>metzitz</italic> (peereth) in <italic>He peereth through the lattice</italic> (Cant. 2:9).</p>
<p>Note that the five senses come together in the two cavities which are in that part of the brain which is behind the forehead. This is where the imaginative power is located. Furthermore, all thoughts begin there. It is for this reason that Scripture writes, regarding the plate, that Aaron shall bear the iniquity <italic>committed in the holy things</italic> (v. 38). It is possible that those who hallowed holy things unto the Lord did so while thinking improper thoughts.<sup><xref rid="fn5166">171</xref></sup></p>
<p>[39. AND THOU SHALT WEAVE THE TUNIC IN CHEQUER WORK.] When Scripture first mentions Aaron&#x2019;s tunic it says, a <italic>tunic of chequer work</italic> (v. 4). Only Aaron&#x2019;s tunic was chequered. His sons&#x2019; tunics were not. The tunic was chequered to dignify Aaron. Scripture similar reads, <italic>And he put upon him the tunic</italic> (Lev. 8:7) when it describes Aaron&#x2019;s investiture. It reads, <italic>the tunic</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn5167">172</xref></sup> the reference being to the chequered tunic. However, concerning Aaron&#x2019;s children we read, <italic>and clothed them with tunics</italic> (Lev. 8:13).<sup><xref rid="fn5168">173</xref></sup> The latter is similar to <italic>And for Aaron&#x2019;s sons thou shalt make tunics</italic> (v. 40).<sup><xref rid="fn5169">174</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon translated <italic>ve-shibatzta</italic> (and thou shalt weave&#x2026;in chequer work) as: you shall weave eye-like [designs].<sup><xref rid="fn5170">175</xref></sup> It is a coin-like design, that is, a square within a circle.<sup><xref rid="fn5171">176</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. AND THOU SHALT PUT THEM UPON AARON THY BROTHER. The word <italic>otam</italic> (them) takes in the chequered tunic, the mitre, and the girdle which are Aaron&#x2019;s garments.

<ftnote id="fn5003"><sup>8</sup> Moses had no opportunity to marry a Hebrew woman.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5005"><sup>10</sup> See Ex. 18:20-26. The point is that Moses was not punished for not marrying a Hebrew woman by having the priesthood taken away from him.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5010"><sup>15</sup> According to Josh. 20:19, 13 cities were set aside for the priests.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5011"><sup>16</sup> In other words, the garments had the power to sanctify those whom they touched; the garments per se were holy.</ftnote>

Since <italic>chakhme</italic> is plural, Scripture should have read <italic>milletim</italic>. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment that <italic>milletiv</italic> refers to <italic>lev</italic>, which is singular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5017"><sup>22</sup> In other words, Scripture first describes the priestly garments in the order in which they were removed when the high priest undressed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5018"><sup>23</sup> Scripture next describes the garments in the order in which Aaron donned them, namely, tunic, mitre, and girdle (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5019"><sup>24</sup> The order is tunic, mitre, and girdle. I.E. connects the tunic and the girdle because the girdle was wound around the tunic.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5020"><sup>25</sup> This is the way Aaron put on his priestly garments. See Lev. 8:7, where Scripture describes the investiture of Aaron. It begins with the tunic, girdle, and robe, viz., <italic>And he put upon him the tunic, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe</italic>, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5021"><sup>26</sup> And first put on the priestly garments. See Lev. 8:6,7.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5035"><sup>40</sup> Hence the end of the verse, Moses <italic>bound it</italic> [the ephod] <italic>unto him</italic> [Aaron] <italic>therewith</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5036"><sup>41</sup> The word ephod means to girdle (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5037"><sup>42</sup> This verse concludes the account of Aaron&#x2019;s donning his vestments. It clearly implies that the mitre was placed on Aaron last, rather than after the tunic.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5038"><sup>43</sup> In other words, <italic>va-yasem</italic> (and he set) has a pluperfect meaning: and he had set. See Vol. 1, p. xvi, item 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5039"><sup>44</sup> Zech. 3:4,5 reads: <italic>Take the filthy garments from off him&#x2026;And I will clothe thee with robes. And I said: Let them set a fair mitre upon his head</italic>. The aforementioned shows that the mitre was donned following the robes. However, when Scripture describes what actually happened it says, <italic>So they seta fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments</italic> (Zech. 3:5). The latter implies that the mitre was put on before the garments. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation that <italic>and clothed him with garments</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.) means, and they had already clothed him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5040"><sup>45</sup> Hence the materials for the sacred garments were not measured out to the &#x201C;wise hearted-men.&#x201D; On the contrary, on their own they <italic>took the gold, the blue</italic>, etc. (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5041"><sup>46</sup> Even though in verse 4 it mentioned the breastplate first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5042"><sup>47</sup> This shows that the breastplate was smaller than the ephod, for the smaller object is normally attached to a larger one.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5043"><sup>48</sup> In other words, the Torah implies that there was only one ephod, the one made by Moses. I.E. was especially bothered by the problem of the many ephods cited in Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5044"><sup>49</sup> Abiathar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5045"><sup>50</sup> This verse implies that other ephods were employed in ancient Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5046"><sup>51</sup> I Sam 23:6 reads &#x201C;<italic>an</italic> ephod,&#x201D; not &#x201C;<italic>the</italic> ephod in his hand.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5047"><sup>52</sup> That is, the ephod made by Moses. According to I.E. ephod means an ephod. The ephod, with the definite article prefixed to it, is the ephod made by Moses. See I.E. on Gen. 31:19, note 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5048"><sup>53</sup> The reference being to the ephod made by Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5049"><sup>54</sup> According to I.E., <italic>that he came down with an ephod in his hand</italic> implies that Abiathar happened to have an ephod which he brought down, whereas if Scripture had read: that he brought down the ephod in his hand, it would have implied that Abiathar deliberately brought down <italic>the</italic> ephod. In the latter case, the reference would be to the ephod made by Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5050"><sup>55</sup> The Biblical text has <italic>fourscore and five</italic>. If it is not a scribal error, then I.E. quoted from memory and erred.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5051"><sup>56</sup> We thus see that there were 80 ephods.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5052"><sup>57</sup> Spoken of in I Sam. 22:18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5053"><sup>58</sup> <italic>Fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod</italic> means fourscore and five persons who were fit to wear a linen ephod. In other words, they did not actually wear an ephod but were worthy of wearing the ephod made by Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5054"><sup>59</sup> Their interpretation does not solve the problem of there being more than one ephod.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5055"><sup>60</sup> Hence I Sam. 22:18 cannot be interpreted as meaning that the priests were worthy of wearing the ephod made by Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5056"><sup>61</sup> <italic>Shesh</italic> is a high quality linen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5057"><sup>62</sup> In other words, even though our verse states that the ephod made by Moses contained linen it was not made wholly out of linen. It was made out of all the material enumerated in our verse (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5058"><sup>63</sup> This introduces another problem connected with the ephod. Namely, it is clear from most places in Scripture that questions concerning future actions were directed to the Urim and Thummim, which were placed in the breastplate of judgment, which was placed on the ephod. However, David inquired of Abiathar&#x2019;s ephod in Ziklag. Now as I.E. later shows, Abiathar&#x2019;s ephod is not to be identified with Moses&#x2019; ephod. Thus in addition to the problem of a multiplicity of ephods, the question arises as to how these other ephods worked, as these ephods did not have the Urim and Thummim attached to them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5059"><sup>64</sup> Spoken by David who asked: will <italic>the men of Keilah deliver me up into his</italic> [Saul&#x2019;s] <italic>hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard?</italic> (I Sam. 23:11).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5060"><sup>65</sup> <italic>Prima facie</italic>, this verse implies that the ephod itself served as the instrument by which God&#x2019;s will was divined.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5061"><sup>66</sup> And Thummim. See next note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5062"><sup>67</sup> Thus it was the Urim and Thummim which served to reveal God&#x2019;s will.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5063"><sup>68</sup> I Sam. 30:7,8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5064"><sup>69</sup> In Ziklag. This ephod did not have the Urim and Thummim with it. The problem described above in note 61 now follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5065"><sup>70</sup> It was attached to the ephod.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5066"><sup>71</sup> It was worn by the priest who accompanied the ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5067"><sup>72</sup> Moses&#x2019; ephod was with Saul. We thus see that other ephods served to divine God&#x2019;s will.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5068"><sup>73</sup> Than the above-raised question relating to a multiplicity of ephods and how they worked.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5069"><sup>74</sup> &#x201C;Urim [means] they made their words enlightening [and Thummim] because they fulfill their words&#x201D; (Soncino, <italic>Yoma</italic> 73b). Rashi explains that the stones on the breastplate of judgment served as the instrument of divination by lighting up. See Rashi on verse 30. Also see note 88. However, Rashi does not identify the stones on the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim. Other commentaries taking the Talmud at face value did. It is with these commentaries that I.E. takes issue.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5070"><sup>75</sup> After describing how the stones were to be arranged on the breastplate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5071"><sup>76</sup> It is thus clear that the Urim and Thummim are not to be identified with the stones on the breastplate of judgment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5072"><sup>77</sup> The printed texts have ephod. This is an obvious error. The word ephod does not appear in <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38. The latter reads: &#x201C;Scripture in describing its making,&#x201D; the reference being to the making of the previously mentioned breastplate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5073"><sup>78</sup> We thus see that the stones are part of the breastplate and are not to be identified with the Urim and Thummim.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5074"><sup>79</sup> In other words, the stones on the breastplate are not to be identified with the Urim and Thummim. See note 73.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5075"><sup>80</sup> As noted above, the Talmud explains that the letters on the stones lit up. It then says, &#x201C;But the <italic>tzadi</italic> was not inscribed on any of the stones.&#x201D; For none of the tribes has a <italic>tzadi</italic> in their names. The Talmud responds, &#x201C;Rabbi Samuel ben Isaac says, &#x2018;The names of Abraham, Isaac (Hebrew, <italic>yod, <span class="underline">tzadi.</span> chet, kof</italic>), and Jacob were also inscribed upon the stones&#x2019;&#x201D; (<italic>Yoma</italic> 73b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5076"><sup>81</sup> See note 80. The Talmud says, &#x201C;But the <italic>tet</italic> was not inscribed on the stones.&#x201D; The words <italic>shivte yeshurun</italic> (the tribes of Jeshurun) were similarly inscribed on the stones&#x201D; (<italic>Yoma</italic> 72b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5077"><sup>82</sup> It does not help us to understand what the Urim and Thummim were.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5078"><sup>83</sup> And as we have seen, the Urim cannot be identical with the stones which were upon the breastplate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5079"><sup>84</sup> In other words, we do not know what the Thummim were.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5080"><sup>85</sup> And we do not know what these objects were.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5081"><sup>86</sup> See Rashi on verse 30: &#x201C;The Urim and Thummim consisted of an inscription of God&#x2019;s explicit name [upon some unknown material] which was placed inside the folds of the breastplate by means of which it [the breastplate] shed light upon its words and fulfilled its words.&#x201D; That is, made its statements clear and its promises true.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5082"><sup>87</sup> According to Rabbi Hai Gaon, inscriptions of God&#x2019;s explicit name cannot be used to divine the future. Nor do they assure success in any endeavor (Rabbi Samuel Zarza, <italic>Mekor Chayyim</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5083"><sup>88</sup> According to I.E. the ephod was an astrological instrument which corresponded to the arrangement of the heavens. It drew power from above and, when properly used, had the ability to predict the future. Nahmanides sided with Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation of the ephod and took strong issue with I.E. See Nahmanides on verse 30, &#x201C;Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra thought to display wisdom in the matter of the Urim and the Thummim, by saying that they were made by a craftsman from gold and silver, and he continued his discussion of them in this vein, for he thought that they were akin to the forms which the astrologers make in order to know the thoughts of the one who comes to ask of them [about the future]. But what [Ibn Ezra] said is of no import. Rather, the Urim and Thummim are as Rashi has written: this was an inscription of the Proper Name of G-d which was placed between the folds of the breast-plate&#x201D; (Chavel translation).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5084"><sup>89</sup> So Zarza. I.E. does not explain what the two wreathen chains on the two rings stand for. Sarim suggests that a line is missing. However, it is possible that I.E. believed that, from what follows, it is obvious what the two wreathen chains on the two rings stand for.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5085"><sup>90</sup> The celestial equator extends from Aries to Libra. It divides the 12 constellations into two parts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5086"><sup>91</sup> They represent the six constellations that lie on the other side of the equator. The point is that six names were written on the two stones of the ephod. Each group of names represented six constellations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5087"><sup>92</sup> The division of the heavens into 12 distinct sections can only be grasped by the mind, for when one looks at the sky one does not see 12 distinct areas in the sky.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5088"><sup>93</sup> On one of the stones of the ephod.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5089"><sup>94</sup> Each stone contained six names. There were no boundaries between them. The stone, as it were, took in all the names in the same way that the sky encompasses all the stars.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5090"><sup>95</sup> Of the ephod.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5091"><sup>96</sup> That is, six names were not written on one stone and six on another, with their boundaries left to the imagination. See notes 92 and 93.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5092"><sup>97</sup> Each tribe&#x2019;s name was inscribed on a separate stone.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5138"><sup>143</sup> The plate. <italic>Tzitz</italic> is masculine but I.E. uses the feminine pronoun (<italic>hi</italic>) because he is referring to <italic>atzabah</italic>, the Arabic equivalent of <italic>tzitz</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5139"><sup>144</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>ve-hi netunah al ha-mitznefet, ve-enennah ki-demut keter ki hu al ha-metzach le-vado</italic>. It is rather strange that I.E. first employs pronouns which refer to the Arabic form of the word and then employs a pronoun which refers to the Hebrew form of the word. It should be noted that <italic>Vat. Ebr</italic>. 38 has a totally different reading. It reads: &#x201C;The Gaon renders <italic>tzitz</italic> (plate) <italic>atzabah</italic>. It is placed on the mitre. The mitre does not have the shape of head-tires, for the head-tires are similar to the high hats which men in this and surrounding countries place upon their heads as a head covering. However, the mitres are made out of long thin material which is twisted only around the head.&#x201D; There is no inconsistency in the tenses in this reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5140"><sup>145</sup> Whereas a crown covers the entire head.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5141"><sup>146</sup> Worn by an ordinary priest, in contrast to the <italic>mitznefet</italic> (mitre) worn by the high priest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5142"><sup>147</sup> Worn by the high priest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5143"><sup>148</sup> In other words, the mitre had a shape which allowed the priest to attach the plate to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5144"><sup>149</sup> In other words, the high priest was not donning a woman&#x2019;s garment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5145"><sup>150</sup> Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5146"><sup>151</sup> According to Rashi, verse 37 appears to contradict itself and Ex. 39:31. For verse 37 states, <italic>And thou shalt put it</italic> (the plate) <italic>on a thread of blue</italic>. However, it goes on to say, <italic>and it</italic> (the plate) <italic>shall be upon the mitre</italic>. This implies that the plate was on the mitre, not upon the thread. Furthermore, Ex. 39:31 states, <italic>And they tied unto it</italic> [the plate] a <italic>thread of blue</italic>. In other words, verse 37 implies that the plate was placed upon the thread, but Ex. 39:31 implies that the thread was placed on top of the plate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5147"><sup>152</sup> Rashi explains that the plate was perforated at three points, viz., at the top and at the two ends of the plate. A thread was inserted through each of these perforations. Each thread was thus doubled when pulled through. Hence Rashi speaks of six threads. The threads were then tied together at the back of the neck. The thread in the center passed over the head and was bound with the ends of the two other threads. Rashi explains: &#x201C;All the verses are now harmonized, <italic>a thread upon the plate, and the plate upon the thread, and a thread upon the mitre on</italic> top.&#x201D; The first refers to the threads on the outer side of the plate, the second to the threads on the inner side of the plate, and the third to the threads that passed through the middle perforation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5148"><sup>153</sup> Attached to both extremities of the plate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5149"><sup>154</sup> In other words, <italic>al</italic> here means with. Hence verse 37 does not contradict Ex. 39:31. See note 152. Also see note 153.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5150"><sup>155</sup> Contra Rashi. See note 154.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5151"><sup>156</sup> The two far sides.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5152"><sup>157</sup> In other words, <italic>upon the forefront of the mitre it</italic> [the plate] <italic>shall be</italic> means that the plate shall be on the forehead.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5153"><sup>158</sup> The front of the mitre.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5154"><sup>159</sup> In other words, <italic>on the mitre</italic> does not mean on the mitre per se, as Rashi says (see note 152) but upon the forehead. Hence Ex. 39:31 does not contradict Ex. 28:37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5155"><sup>160</sup> In the sense of with. The word <italic>al</italic> usually has the meaning of on. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5156"><sup>161</sup> <italic>Al</italic> used in the sense of with.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5157"><sup>162</sup> Translated according to I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5158"><sup>163</sup> In other words, contra Rashi on this verse, the mitre and the head-tire are not identical, for if they were, Scripture would interchange these terms. I.E. literally reads: &#x201C;Now you will never find.&#x201D; This is a very laconic statement. Some would emend it to: Now we do not find [the mitre] to be worn [by all the priests]. In other words, the mitre is not to be identified with the head-tire.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5159"><sup>164</sup> In other words, the <italic>migba&#x2019;at</italic> had the shape of a high hat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5160"><sup>165</sup> Hebrew, <italic>mitznefet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5161"><sup>166</sup> Hence it is not to be identified with the <italic>migba&#x2019;at</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5162"><sup>167</sup> According to I.E. the meaning of the verse is: The mitre shall be removed&#x2026;this shall no more be the same; the material making up the mitre shall no longer be wound from the bottom up or from the top down; i.e., the <italic>miztnefet</italic> shall no longer be wound about the head.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5163"><sup>168</sup> Not to be confused with the word <italic>keter</italic> (crown), as the <italic>keter</italic> covers the entire head.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Chapter 29</title>
<p>1. AND THIS IS THE THING THAT THOU SHALT DO UNTO THEM. To Aaron and his sons.</p>
<p>[TAKE.] There is no difference<sup><xref rid="fn5176">1</xref></sup> between <italic>lekach</italic> (take)<sup><xref rid="fn5177">2</xref></sup> and <italic>kach</italic> (take).<sup><xref rid="fn5178">3</xref></sup> We find the same to be true of <italic>tzak</italic> (pour out)<sup><xref rid="fn5179">4</xref></sup> and <italic>yetzak</italic> (pour)<sup><xref rid="fn5180">5</xref></sup> in <italic>Pour out</italic> (tzak) <italic>for the people, that they may eat</italic> (II Kings 4:41) and in <italic>And also pour</italic> (yetzak) <italic>water into it</italic> (Ezek. 24:3).</p>
<p>[ONE YOUNG BULLOCK.] The fact that Scripture notes that the <italic>par</italic> (bull) was a <italic>ben bakar</italic> (of the herd)<sup><xref rid="fn5181">6</xref></sup> indicates that the <italic>par</italic> (bull) was young. The same applies to the phrase <italic>bene yonah</italic> (turtle-doves)<sup><xref rid="fn5182">7</xref></sup> (Lev. 1:14), and the phrase <italic>se&#x2019;_ir izzim</italic> (a goat) (Lev. 4:23).<sup><xref rid="fn5183">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND TWO RAMS.] An <italic>ayal</italic> (ram)<sup><xref rid="fn5184">9</xref></sup> is older than a <italic>keves</italic> (lamb). The fact that the drink offering for an <italic>ayal</italic> (ram) consists of a third of a <italic>hin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5185">10</xref></sup> and that of a <italic>keves</italic> (lamb) a quarter of a <italic>hin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5186">11</xref></sup> proves this.<sup><xref rid="fn5187">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND UNLEAVENED&#x2026;CAKES. They were thick, as <italic>wafers</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5188">13</xref></sup> <italic>unleavened</italic> proves.<sup><xref rid="fn5189">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WITH OIL.] Scripture reads <italic>ba-shemen</italic> (with oil).<sup><xref rid="fn5190">15</xref></sup> The reference, in keeping with the rule,<sup><xref rid="fn5191">16</xref></sup> is to olive oil.<sup><xref rid="fn5192">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>[Of FINE WHEATEN FLOUR.] The word <italic>solet</italic> (fine flour) refers to flour made from wheat cleansed of all impurities. It is called <italic>samid</italic> in Arabic.<sup><xref rid="fn5193">18</xref></sup> It is produced in the land of the Ishmaelites. There is no better bread than bread made from it.<sup><xref rid="fn5194">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many connect the word <italic>solet</italic> to the word <italic>salita</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5195">20</xref></sup> (thou hast trodden)<sup><xref rid="fn5196">21</xref></sup> in <italic>Thou hast trodden light all them that err from Thy statutes</italic> (Ps. 119:118);<sup><xref rid="fn5197">22</xref></sup> and to <italic>sillah</italic> (trodden) in <italic>The Lord hath trodden All my mighty men in the midst of me</italic> (Lam. 1:15).<sup><xref rid="fn5198">23</xref></sup> They say that <italic>makkolet</italic> (food) in <italic>food to your household</italic> (I Kings 5:25)<sup><xref rid="fn5199">24</xref></sup> is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn5200">25</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>solet</italic> means ground.<sup><xref rid="fn5201">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND BRING THEM IN THE BASKET. You shall bring the bread, which is in the basket as the law requires,<sup><xref rid="fn5202">27</xref></sup> to the door of the tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn5203">28</xref></sup> The same applies to the bullock and the rams.<sup><xref rid="fn5204">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THOU SHALT TAKE THE GARMENTS. The breastplate (<italic>choshen</italic>) is called a garment<sup><xref rid="fn5205">30</xref></sup> because it covers that part of the body which lies opposite the heart.</p>
<p>6. AND THOU SHALT SET. It is also<sup><xref rid="fn5206">31</xref></sup> not beyond the realm of possibility that Moses placed the mitre on Aaron last.<sup><xref rid="fn5207">32</xref></sup> Scripture mentions the mitre before the girdle<sup><xref rid="fn5208">33</xref></sup> at the opening of the Torah portion<sup><xref rid="fn5209">34</xref></sup> because the mitre is more important than the girdle.<sup><xref rid="fn5210">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. HIS HEAD. Only on Aaron&#x2019;s head,<sup><xref rid="fn5211">36</xref></sup> as he was the anointed priest. Now Aaron was anointed before the mitre was placed on his head,<sup><xref rid="fn5212">37</xref></sup> for Moses poured the oil only upon the head.<sup><xref rid="fn5213">38</xref></sup> We similarly read, <italic>It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard; Even Aaron&#x2019;s beard</italic> (Ps. 133:2).<sup><xref rid="fn5214">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND THOU SHALT BRING HIS SONS. To the door of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p>9. AND THOU SHALT GIRD THEM WITH GIRDLES. <italic>Girdles</italic> takes in Aaron&#x2019;s girdle and the girdle of his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn5215">40</xref></sup> Similarly the breeches.<sup><xref rid="fn5216">41</xref></sup> After stating <italic>them</italic>, Scripture goes on to explain that the reference is to Aaron and his sons. It is similar to <italic>And she opened it, and saw it, even the child</italic> (Ex. 2:6).<sup><xref rid="fn5217">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND BIND.] The word <italic>ve-chavashta</italic> (and bind) is similar to the word <italic>chovesh</italic> (healer) in <italic>I will not be a healer</italic> (Is. 3:7).<sup><xref rid="fn5218">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THOU SHALT CONSECRATE. The one who translated the Torah into Aramaic<sup><xref rid="fn5219">44</xref></sup> is of the opinion that <italic>u-milleta yad</italic> (and thou shalt consecrate)<sup><xref rid="fn5220">45</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>u-milu yadav</italic> (so shall they consecrate it)<sup><xref rid="fn5221">46</xref></sup> (Ezek. 43:26).<sup><xref rid="fn5222">47</xref></sup> However, what shall we do with <italic>milu yedkhem ha-yom</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5223">48</xref></sup> (consecrate yourselves today to the Lord) (Ex. 32:29)?<sup><xref rid="fn5224">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon explains the word <italic>yad</italic> to mean obligation.<sup><xref rid="fn5225">50</xref></sup> Others say that the term <italic>melu&#x2019;im</italic> (consecration)<sup><xref rid="fn5226">51</xref></sup> is used because it indicates that they are complete, full, and trained.<sup><xref rid="fn5227">52</xref></sup> However, what will they do with <italic>u-mile&#x2019;u yadav</italic> (so shall they consecrate it<sup><xref rid="fn5228">53</xref></sup>) (Ezek. 43:26)?<sup><xref rid="fn5229">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND THOU SHALT BRING THE BULLOCK. This has already been mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn5230">55</xref></sup> Its meaning is as follows. When you shall bring the bullock,<sup><xref rid="fn5231">56</xref></sup> Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon it.<sup><xref rid="fn5232">57</xref></sup> Some say that the meaning of <italic>and Aaron shall lay</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5233">58</xref></sup> is: Aaron alone shall first lay his hands upon the head of the bullock. His sons shall then do the same. Now with regard to the ram, Scripture later states, <italic>and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram</italic> (v. 15). Scripture thus describes exactly what happened. They should lay their hands together, not one after the other.<sup><xref rid="fn5234">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND THOU SHALT KILL THE BULLOCK. Moses slaughtered the bullock.</p>
<p>[BEFORE THE LORD.] Scripture reads, before the Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn5235">60</xref></sup> because the ark was in the center of the western side of the tabernacle. The incense altar was directly aligned with it. So was the altar of the burnt offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn5236">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. HE SHALL POUR OUT.<sup><xref rid="fn5237">62</xref></sup> The priest who pours shall pour out.<sup><xref rid="fn5238">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND THOU SHALT TAKE. Bullock and goats do not have a fat tail (<italic>alyah</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn5239">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>[KIDNEYS.] Some say that <italic>kelayot</italic> (kidneys) are so called because the word <italic>kelayot</italic> is related to the word <italic>kaletah</italic> (pineth) in <italic>My soul yearneth, yea even pineth for the courts of the Lord</italic> (Ps. 84:3). For the power of sexual desire is located in the kidneys.</p>
<p>14. BUT THE FLESH OF THE BULLOCK. Flesh takes in the head and the pieces of the bullock.</p>
<p>AND ITS DUNG.<sup><xref rid="fn5240">65</xref></sup> Logically speaking,<sup><xref rid="fn5241">66</xref></sup> it<sup><xref rid="fn5242">67</xref></sup> was to be washed and then it<sup><xref rid="fn5243">68</xref></sup> was to be burned.<sup><xref rid="fn5244">69</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>AND HE SHALL MAKE THEM SMOKE (<italic>ve-hiktir</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn5245">70</xref></sup> The reference is to the enumerated organs.<sup><xref rid="fn5246">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>[SIN-OFFERING.] A sin offering is called a <italic>chatat</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn5247">72</xref></sup> because it is brought to atone for a sin. The same applies to the <italic>asham</italic> (guilt-offering).<sup><xref rid="fn5248">73</xref></sup> Hence the meaning of <italic>ve-chitte&#x2019;u et ha-mizbe&#x2019;ach</italic> (they shall purify the altar)<sup><xref rid="fn5249">74</xref></sup> is: they shall remove the sin from the altar.</p>
<p>15. THOU SHALT ALSO TAKE THE ONE RAM. Any one of the two rams which you decide to choose.<sup><xref rid="fn5250">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THOU SHALT SLAY THE RAM, AND THOU SHALT TAKE ITS BLOOD AND DASH IT ROUND ABOUT AGAINST THE ALTAR. Not on the corners of the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn5251">76</xref></sup> Look, he [Moses] shall dash all the blood round about against the altar and not upon the base of the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn5252">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND THE RAM. Scripture does not mention that Moses was commanded to cut the bullock into pieces. It was therefore entirely burned. Hence Scripture does not mention the bullock&#x2019;s legs.<sup><xref rid="fn5253">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WASH.<sup><xref rid="fn5254">79</xref></sup> By command.<sup><xref rid="fn5255">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND THOU SHALT MAKE THE WHOLE RAM SMOKE. Hence the fat tail and the fat<sup><xref rid="fn5256">81</xref></sup> are not mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn5257">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND THOU SHALT TAKE. This second ram served as the ram of consecration.<sup><xref rid="fn5258">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. THEN THOU SHALT KILL&#x2026;TIP. The word <italic>tenukh</italic> (tip) has no counterpart.<sup><xref rid="fn5259">84</xref></sup> Saadiah Gaon says that it refers to the soft tissue which is connected to the circle of the ear.<sup><xref rid="fn5260">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE GREAT TOE. The plural of <italic>bohen</italic> (great toe) is <italic>behonot</italic> (Jud. 1:6). This is grammatically inconsistent.<sup><xref rid="fn5261">86</xref></sup> This noun is thus vocalized according to two paradigms.<sup><xref rid="fn5262">87</xref></sup> There are many such nouns.</p>
<p>[AND DASH THE BLOOD.] The blood of the second ram shall be dashed<sup><xref rid="fn5263">88</xref></sup> like the blood of the first ram.<sup><xref rid="fn5264">89</xref></sup> The reference is only to the remaining blood.<sup><xref rid="fn5265">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THOU SHALT TAKE OF THE BLOOD THAT IS UPON THE ALTAR&#x2026;AND SPRINKLE IT UPON AARON, AND UPON HIS GARMENTS. Beneath his garments<sup><xref rid="fn5266">91</xref></sup> and upon his garments.</p>
<p>22. AND THOU SHALT TAKE OF THE RAM THE FAT. The reference is to the fat that is upon the innards, as stated in the Torah portion <italic>Va-Yikra</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5267">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE RIGHT THIGH. The thigh that is on the right side<sup><xref rid="fn5268">93</xref></sup> and the breast were taken from the ram of consecration. From that day on, the thigh and the breast of peace offerings were to be given to Aaron and his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn5269">94</xref></sup> However, Moses alone ate the breast of the ram of consecration because he was a high priest.<sup><xref rid="fn5270">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND ONE LOAF OF BREAD. The reference is to the <italic>unleavened bread</italic> (v. 2).</p>
<p>24. AND SHALT WAVE THEM. While they<sup><xref rid="fn5271">96</xref></sup> are in the hands of Aaron and his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn5272">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THOU SHALT TAKE THEM FROM THEIR HANDS. Our verse states, <italic>from their hands</italic>. Elsewhere Scripture states, <italic>from off their hands</italic> (Lev. 8:28). They mean the same thing.</p>
<p>A SWEET SAVOUR. The <italic>chet</italic> is doubled in <italic>nicho&#x2019;ach</italic> (sweet savour).<sup><xref rid="fn5273">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>[A SWEET SAVOUR BEFORE THE LORD.] The one who understands the secret of man&#x2019;s soul<sup><xref rid="fn5274">99</xref></sup> will understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn5275">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>AN OFFERING. The word <italic>issheh</italic> (offering) is an adjective. It is related to the word <italic>esh</italic> (fire). Scripture elsewhere states, <italic>from the fire</italic> (Num. 18:9).<sup><xref rid="fn5276">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. AND THOU SHALT TAKE. From Aaron&#x2019;s ram. Aaron&#x2019;s sons are not mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn5277">102</xref></sup> as Aaron was the principal.</p>
<p>[PORTION.] The word <italic>manah</italic> means a portion.</p>
<p>27. AND THOU SHALT SANCTIFY. From this day and henceforth.<sup><xref rid="fn5278">103</xref></sup> Waving and heaving are not identical.<sup><xref rid="fn5279">104</xref></sup> For what is heaved is lifted up. It is not waved.<sup><xref rid="fn5280">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>even their heave-offering</italic> (v. 28) is: the heave offerings which they will separate from peace offerings, shall be heaved in honor of God.<sup><xref rid="fn5281">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND THE HOLY GARMENTS OF AARON SHALL BE FOR HIS SONS AFTER HIM. Shall be for his son who is anointed in his place.<sup><xref rid="fn5282">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AFTER HIM.] After his death.</p>
<p>30. SEVEN DAYS. The word <italic>yilbasham</italic> (put them on) is vocalized with a long rather than a short <italic>kamatz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5283">108</xref></sup> The word <italic>amilam</italic> (I will cut them off) in <italic>Verily, in the name of the Lord I will cut them off</italic> (Ps. 118:10) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn5284">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. AND SEETHE. By command.<sup><xref rid="fn5285">110</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>and thou shalt smite the rock</italic> (Ex. 17:6),<sup><xref rid="fn5286">111</xref></sup> and to <italic>So Solomon built the house</italic> (I Kings 6:14).<sup><xref rid="fn5287">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. AND AARON AND HIS SONS SHALL EAT. The bread remaining in the basket.<sup><xref rid="fn5288">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. AND THEY SHALL EAT THOSE THINGS. The verse is abridged.<sup><xref rid="fn5289">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THEM.] The word <italic>otam</italic> (them) also refers to something else.<sup><xref rid="fn5290">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT A STRANGER. Who is not of Aaron&#x2019;s seed.</p>
<p>34. AND IF AUGHT. The ram of consecration is so called because they are consecrated by it.<sup><xref rid="fn5291">116</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. THEE. The word <italic>otakhah</italic> has an <italic>etnach</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5292">117</xref></sup> beneath it.<sup><xref rid="fn5293">118</xref></sup> <italic>Otakhah</italic> is a combination of <italic>otakh</italic> (thee) (Gen. 39:9), which is vocalized with a long <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath the <italic>tav</italic>, and <italic>otekha</italic> (thee)<sup><xref rid="fn5294">119</xref></sup> in <italic>for thee have I seen</italic> (Gen. 7:1).</p>
<p>36. AND EVERY DAY SHALT THOU OFFER THE BULLOCK. Every day of the seven days of consecration.</p>
<p>[BESIDE THE OTHER OFFERINGS OF ATONEMENT.] Its meaning is, in addition to the two rams.<sup><xref rid="fn5295">120</xref></sup> Scripture further states, <italic>As hath been done this day, so the Lord hath commanded to do</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn5296">121</xref></sup> <italic>to make atonement for you</italic> (Lev. 8:34).</p>
<p>37. MOST HOLY. The meaning of <italic>kodesh kodashim</italic> (most holy) is holy like any other holy object.<sup><xref rid="fn5297">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHATSOEVER TOUCHES THE ALTAR SHALL BE HOLY. This is similar to <italic>Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy</italic> (Lev. 6:20).<sup><xref rid="fn5298">123</xref></sup> Some say that the verse speaks only of the bread. Scripture is telling us that if the bread is not holy, that is, if the bread is unclean, then it shall not touch the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn5299">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. NOW THIS IS. Its meaning is: now this is the sacrifice.<sup><xref rid="fn5300">125</xref></sup> Similarly, the meaning of <italic>This they shall give</italic> (Ex. 30:13) is: this amount they shall give.<sup><xref rid="fn5301">126</xref></sup> Similarly <italic>And this is that thou shalt make it</italic> <sup><xref rid="fn5302">127</xref></sup> (Gen. 6:15).<sup><xref rid="fn5303">128</xref></sup> Moses shall do this<sup><xref rid="fn5304">129</xref></sup> during the seven days of consecration. Afterwards<sup><xref rid="fn5305">130</xref></sup> Aaron and his sons shall do likewise.</p>
<p>39. THE ONE LAMB. The <italic>heh</italic> prefixed to the word <italic>keves</italic> (lamb) also serves as a prefix to the word <italic>echad</italic> (one).<sup><xref rid="fn5306">131</xref></sup> The phrase is to be read as if written, <italic>et ha-keves ha-echad</italic> (the one lamb).<sup><xref rid="fn5307">132</xref></sup> Rabbi Moses Ha-Kohen says that the meaning of <italic>et ha-keves echad</italic> is, the lamb, one lamb.<sup><xref rid="fn5308">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. A TENTH PART. A tenth part of an <italic>ephah</italic>.</p>
<p>[A HIN.] Also note that <italic>hin</italic> is an Egyptian measure.<sup><xref rid="fn5309">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. AND. The word <italic>u-kheniskah</italic> (and according to the drink offering thereof)<sup><xref rid="fn5310">135</xref></sup> refers to <italic>boker</italic> (morning).<sup><xref rid="fn5311">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>42. IT SHALL BE A CONTINUAL BURNT-OFFERING THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS. They shall bring these offerings when they enter the land of Canaan. For the Israelites offered burnt offerings only for fifty days in the desert of Sinai. This is what Scripture means by <italic>It is a continual burnt-offering, which was offered in mount Sinai</italic> (Num. 28:6). The tabernacle was placed at the edge of the camp at the bottom of the mount,<sup><xref rid="fn5312">137</xref></sup> as the tribes were intermingled.<sup><xref rid="fn5313">138</xref></sup> On the first day of the second month<sup><xref rid="fn5314">139</xref></sup> they began to know the number of each tribe and to make standards (Num. 1 and 2).<sup><xref rid="fn5315">140</xref></sup> After they traveled a distance of a three-day journey from Mount Sinai, the ark journeyed<sup><xref rid="fn5316">141</xref></sup> in the midst of the camps (Num. 10:33).<sup><xref rid="fn5317">142</xref></sup></p>
<p>Logically speaking, the Israelites offered burnt offerings and sacrifices only at Sinai and on Yom Kippur in the second year. This is what Scripture states regarding Aaron&#x2019;s service.<sup><xref rid="fn5318">143</xref></sup> The Torah there writes, <italic>And he</italic> [Aaron] <italic>did as the Lord commanded Moses</italic> (Lev. 16:34).<sup><xref rid="fn5319">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture similarly states, <italic>Did ye bring unto Me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</italic> (Amos 5:25). Israel spent about thirty-eight years in a wasteland, in <italic>a howling wilderness</italic> (Deut. 32:10). Where did they get half a <italic>hin</italic> of olive oil and a half <italic>hin</italic> of wine daily?<sup><xref rid="fn5320">145</xref></sup> How could they carry almost fourteen thousand <italic>hin</italic> around with them?<sup><xref rid="fn5321">146</xref></sup> Where did they get two lambs daily in the first year? Where did they get the animals for the additional sacrifices on the Sabbath and the festivals?</p>
<p>The statement <italic>we and our cattle</italic> (Num. 20:4)<sup><xref rid="fn5322">147</xref></sup> does not refute our contention, for Israel was then at Kadesh,<sup><xref rid="fn5323">148</xref></sup> and they bought cattle from the settled population. Furthermore, they looted the Midianites and the lands of Sihon and Og in that year. They thus had an abundance of cattle.<sup><xref rid="fn5324">149</xref></sup></p>
<p>[I WILL MEET.]<sup><xref rid="fn5325">150</xref></sup> Scripture clearly explains the reason that the tabernacle is called the <italic>ohel mo&#x2019;ed</italic> (the tent of meeting).<sup><xref rid="fn5326">151</xref></sup></p>
<p>WITH YOU. Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn5327">152</xref></sup> We find this to be the case when the congregation was called together.<sup><xref rid="fn5328">153</xref></sup></p>
<p>TO SPEAK THERE UNTO THEE. To speak there alone to you.<sup><xref rid="fn5329">154</xref></sup> However, Yefet says that the meaning of <italic>I will meet with you</italic> is: with Moses and occasionally with Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn5330">155</xref></sup> He maintains that <italic>to speak there unto thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5331">156</xref></sup> hints that God will continually speak there with Moses. He offers, <italic>And there I will meet with the children of Israel</italic> (v. 43) as proof.<sup><xref rid="fn5332">157</xref></sup></p>
<p>43. AND [THE TENT] SHALL BE SANCTIFIED BY MY GLORY. I believe that the tent of meeting was the place of meeting because it took in everything, namely, the tabernacle and all its utensils, the ark, and the three objects.<sup><xref rid="fn5333">158</xref></sup> The tent will be sanctified by My glory, which will rest on the cherubim.<sup><xref rid="fn5334">159</xref></sup></p>
<p>44. AND I WILL SANCTIFY THE TENT OF MEETING. It is because of the glory that the tent is holy, for it was sanctified by the glory.<sup><xref rid="fn5335">160</xref></sup> The altar that stood<sup><xref rid="fn5336">161</xref></sup> before the opening of the tent of meeting was similarly sanctified.<sup><xref rid="fn5337">162</xref></sup></p>
<p>AARON ALSO AND HIS SONS WILL I SANCTIFY. I will sanctify Aaron and his sons, who minister in the tent of meeting and upon the altar.</p>
<p>45. AND I WILL DWELL. Scripture describes how God&#x2019;s glory will dwell among the children of Israel when the standards will be set up.<sup><xref rid="fn5338">163</xref></sup> Four standards were set up on the four sides.<sup><xref rid="fn5339">164</xref></sup> Additionally, there was a separation between the camp of the Levites and the camp of the Israelites<sup><xref rid="fn5340">165</xref></sup> because they too camped on all four sides,<sup><xref rid="fn5341">166</xref></sup> There was another barrier beyond this barrier where the tent of meeting was placed amidst the children of Israel.</p>
<p>Now a person who experienced a seminal emission did not have to leave the camp of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn5342">167</xref></sup> Neither was there a place set aside beyond the border of the camp for a person to sit down [and relieve himself].<sup><xref rid="fn5343">168</xref></sup> The commandment for a person who experienced a seminal emission to leave the camp<sup><xref rid="fn5344">169</xref></sup> applied only to the camp of Israel when it went to war against the enemy.<sup><xref rid="fn5345">170</xref></sup> The commandment <italic>When thou goest forth in camp against thine enemies</italic> (Deut. 23:10) similarly does not speak of the entire camp of Israel, men, women, and children. It is only males, and then only a small number of them, who sally out to wage war. Now when the soldiers of Israel carried the ark with them as Phineas did,<sup><xref rid="fn5346">171</xref></sup> they were unable to set up a barrier between themselves and the place of the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn5347">172</xref></sup></p>
<p>46. AND THEY SHALL KNOW. Its meaning is, then they shall know that the only reason that I took them out of Egypt was so that they would make a sanctuary for Me that I may dwell among them. This is what Scripture means by <italic>ye shall serve God upon this mountain</italic> (Ex. 3:12).<sup><xref rid="fn5348">173</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn5205"><sup>30</sup> Our verse includes it among the priestly garments. However, it was not really a garment. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5206"><sup>31</sup> See note 32.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5207"><sup>32</sup> After placing all the other garments upon Aaron, for this is what the plain meaning of our text implies. This should be contrasted with I.E. &#x2018;s comments on Ex. 28:4. There he wrote that Moses placed the mitre on Aaron&#x2019;s head after dressing him in his tunic. I.E. was not sure what the procedure was. Hence he uses the expression, &#x201C;It is also not beyond the realm of possibility.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5208"><sup>33</sup> Ex. 28:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5209"><sup>34</sup> Even though the girdle was put on before the mitre, as the mitre was put on last.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5210"><sup>35</sup> That is, according to this interpretation. Scripture mentions the mitre before the girdle, even though the girdle was put on first, because the mitre is more important.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5211"><sup>36</sup> The anointing oil was poured only upon Aaron&#x2019;s head.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5212"><sup>37</sup> Even though Scripture mentions the donning of the mitre before it mentions the anointment. Nahmanides takes issue with I.E. He writes, &#x201C;He wound [the <italic>mitznefet</italic>] around and around the head, but left the middle of the head uncovered, and it was on that place that he poured the oil&#x201D; (<italic>Ramban&#x2019;s Commentary on the Torah</italic>, Chavel translation).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5213"><sup>38</sup> Not upon the mitre. Hence the oil had to be poured upon Aaron&#x2019;s head before the mitre was placed upon it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5214"><sup>39</sup> We thus see that the oil was poured only over Aaron&#x2019;s head. It was not poured upon the mitre.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5215"><sup>40</sup> The term refers both to Aaron&#x2019;s girdle and to that of his sons because they all wore the same type of girdle (Krinsky). Sarim is of the opinion that Aaron&#x2019;s girdle differed from the girdle of his sons. According to Sarim, I.E. is explaining that the term <italic>girdles</italic> refers both to Aaron&#x2019;s girdle and to the girdle of his sons even though their girdles differed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5216"><sup>41</sup> Moses similarly placed breeches upon Aaron and his sons even though Scripture omits mentioning this. Nahmanides held that Moses did not put breeches on Aaron and his sons. He explains that they put on their breeches in private. Hence Scripture omits the donning of the breeches.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5223"><sup>48</sup> Literally, fill your hands today.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5224"><sup>49</sup> Ex. 32:29 speaks of killing those who worshipped the golden calf. Thus the term &#x201C;fill your hand&#x201D; cannot mean offer a sacrifice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5225"><sup>50</sup> According to Saadiah <italic>u-milleta yad aharon ve-yad banav</italic> means: see to it that Aaron and his sons fulfill their obligation. Thus according to the Gaon, to fill the hand means to do one&#x2019;s duty.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5226"><sup>51</sup> Literally, filled.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5227"><sup>52</sup> Thus the phrase to fill the hand means train the hand. See I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary, &#x201C;During the days of <italic>melu&#x2019;im</italic> the priest learned&#x2026;to train his hands in the service.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5233"><sup>58</sup> The text literally reads: and Aaron shall lay and his sons their hands on the head of the bullock. <italic>Ve-samakh</italic> (shall lay) is in the singular. Hence the interpretation quoted by I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5234"><sup>59</sup> For the text reads, <italic>ve-samekhu</italic> (shall lay). <italic>Ve-samekhu</italic> is in the plural. The commentaries on I.E. differ over how to interpret this comment. Some take it to mean that I.E. indicates there was no difference in procedure between the laying of the hands upon the bullock and the laying of the hands upon the rams; in both cases Aaron and his sons put their hands upon the sacrificial animals in unison (Krinsky). Meijler is of the opinion that I.E. believes that in contrast to the laying of the hands upon the rams, Aaron first laid his hands upon the bullock and then his sons did the same. The difference of opinion revolves around how we interpret &#x201C;Scripture thus describes exactly what happened.&#x201D; Krinsky takes it to refer to both instances, while Meijler takes it to refer only to the second instance. For further elucidation, see Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5235"><sup>60</sup> Before the Lord seems to imply before the ark. However, the bullock was sacrificed before the altar which stood in the temple courtyard.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5236"><sup>61</sup> Which stood in the courtyard.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5237"><sup>62</sup> <italic>Yishpokh</italic>. In our text of the Pentateuch the reading is: Thou shalt pour out (<italic>tishpokh</italic>). Meijler and Krinsky believe that I.E.&#x2019;s version of the Pentateuch reads <italic>yishpokh</italic> (he shall pour out). However, Weiser believes that the reading of <italic>yishpokh</italic> is due to a copyist&#x2019;s error. According to Weiser, I.E. also reads <italic>tishpokh</italic> (thou shalt pour out), and I.E. commented thereupon: <italic>Yishpokh ha-kohen ha-shofekh</italic> (The priest who pours shall pour out). In other words, I.E. explained, that <italic>Thou shalt pour</italic> is not to be taken literally, for Moses was not commanded to personally pour out the blood. He was told to appoint a priest to carry out this task. Some copyist then dropped the word <italic>tishpokh</italic> from the heading and made <italic>yishpokh</italic> into a heading. Hence our reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5238"><sup>63</sup> All the remaining blood at the base of the altar. See note 63.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5243"><sup>68</sup> Krinsky explains that the meaning of <italic>and its dung shalt thou burn</italic> is: and the place where the dung collected thou shalt burn.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5244"><sup>69</sup> Filwarg emends <italic>u-firsho</italic> (and its dung) to <italic>u-lefi</italic>. He interprets <italic>But the flesh of the bullock</italic> as follows: Flesh takes in the head and the pieces of the bullock. Now logically speaking, it was to be washed and then it was to be burned; i.e., the bullock was to be washed in the same manner that the ram (v. 17) was. See Weiser, Sarim, and Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5245"><sup>70</sup> The word <italic>ve-hiktir</italic> (and he shall make them smoke) does not appear in our verse. Weiser suggests that it has been transposed from verse 13. However, verse 13 reads <italic>ve-hiktarta</italic> (and make them smoke). Weiser explains that the original comment on verse 13 reads as follows: <italic>Ve-hiktarta</italic> (and [thou shalt] make them smoke). Commenting on this, I.E. writes: <italic>Ve-hiktir</italic> (and he shall make them smoke). That is, Moses himself was not commanded to personally place the organs on the fire; another priest would do as well. For some reason, a copyist left out the heading <italic>ve-hiktarta</italic> and the word <italic>ve-hiktir</italic> was transposed to verse 14. Meijler, on the other hand, claims that the word <italic>ve-hiktir</italic> should not be read as a heading but rather as the continuation of the previous sentence. The latter should read: Logically speaking, it was washed and then it was burned. After this, the priest smoked the enumerated organs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5246"><sup>71</sup> The organs listed in verse 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5247"><sup>72</sup> A sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5248"><sup>73</sup> Literally, guilt. The sacrifice is referred to as &#x201C;guilt&#x201D; because it is brought to atone for one&#x2019;s guilt.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5250"><sup>75</sup> In other words, the word <italic>ha-echad</italic> (the one) is short for <italic>ha-echad me-hashenayim</italic> (one of the two). I.E. comments thus because <italic>the one ram</italic> seems to imply that Scripture has a specific ram in mind.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5259"><sup>84</sup> Hebrew, <italic>en lo re&#x2019;a</italic>. This usually indicates that the word appears nowhere else in Scripture. See I.E. on Num. 11:7.

<ftnote id="fn5260"><sup>85</sup> The earlobe.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5261"><sup>86</sup> According to the rules of Hebrew grammar the plural of <italic>bohen</italic> is <italic>behanot</italic>, not <italic>behonot</italic>. Compare, <italic>goren, geranot</italic>. The singular of <italic>bahon</italic> is <italic>behonot</italic> (Weiser).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5289"><sup>114</sup> The subject is missing. According to I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary on Exodus our verse literally reads: And they shall eat those things who atoned by them. The latter is short for: And the men who atoned by them shall eat those things.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5290"><sup>115</sup> The word <italic>otam</italic> (them) in <italic>le-kadesh otam</italic> (to sanctify them) also applies to <italic>ve-zar lo yokhkal</italic> (but a stranger shall not eat).

<ftnote id="fn5307"><sup>132</sup> This is precisely the reading of our texts. However, the parallel reading in Num. 28:4 is <italic>ha-keves echad</italic>.

I.E. might have been commenting from memory and confused the two sections. However, Shadal, Meijler, and Filwarg believe that I.E. had a version of the Pentateuch in which Ex. 29:39 read: <italic>et ha-keves echad</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5308"><sup>133</sup> In other words, the word <italic>keves</italic> is to be read as if written twice, that is, <italic>et ha-keves, keves echad</italic>. This comment is also repeated in Num. 28:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5309"><sup>134</sup> I.E. similarly believed that the name Moses and the word <italic>chartumim</italic> are Egyptian words. See I.E. on Ex. 2:10 and 7:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5310"><sup>135</sup> <italic>U-kheniskah</italic> is in the feminine. Hence it cannot refer to <italic>keves</italic>, which is masculine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5311"><sup>136</sup> That is, to <italic>ke-minchat ha-boker</italic> (according to the meal-offering of the morning). <italic>Minchah</italic> is feminine. So Weiser. Filwarg believes that I.E. is of the opinion that <italic>boker</italic> here is feminine. Hence <italic>u-kheniskah</italic> refers to it rather than to <italic>keves</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5312"><sup>137</sup> When it was first erected on the first day of Nisan (Ex. 40:17). Israel journeyed from Sinai on the 20th day of the second month (Num. 10:11,12). The tabernacle was thus at Sinai for 50 days. It was during these 50 days that Israel offered burnt offerings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5313"><sup>138</sup> The Israelites formed an amorphous mass. The only open space available for the tabernacle was at the edge of the camp.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5314"><sup>139</sup> Of the second year following the Exodus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5315"><sup>140</sup> That is, it was only on the first day of the second month of the second year that the Israelites were organized into separate groups with their own place around standards, with the tabernacle in the center of the camp.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5316"><sup>141</sup> It is unlikely that Israel would offer sacrifices while the ark journeyed (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5317"><sup>142</sup> Of the 12 tribes of Israel. It is I.E.&#x2019;s opinion that for the first three days of their journey from Sinai, the ark traveled <italic>before the camp</italic> (Num. 10:33). After that, it journeyed in their midst. See I.E. on Num. 10:31. Be that as it may, I.E.&#x2019;s point is that after 50 days at Sinai, the ark was no longer in the tabernacle and thus no sacrifices were offered. See Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5318"><sup>143</sup> That is, regarding the service which Aaron was to perform on Yom Kippur.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5328"><sup>153</sup> God met with the congregation when Moses called them together by sounding trumpets. See Num. 10:3, <italic>And when they shall blow with them, all the congregation shall gather themselves unto thee at the door of the tent of meeting</italic>. So Meijler and Filwarg. According to Weiser its meaning is: Scripture uses the word <italic>ve-no&#x2019;adu</italic> (shall gather themselves), which comes from the same root as <italic>mo&#x2019;ed</italic> when it describes the gathering of the congregation. We thus see that the term <italic>mo&#x2019;ed</italic> means gathering or meeting.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5329"><sup>154</sup> <italic>Elekha</italic> (unto thee) is in the singular. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5330"><sup>155</sup> Hence the use of the plural <italic>lakhem</italic> (with you).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5331"><sup>156</sup> Hence <italic>elekha</italic> (unto thee) is in the singular.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5332"><sup>157</sup> If <italic>lakhem</italic> refers to Israel, why would Scripture repeat itself in verse 43?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5333"><sup>158</sup> The table of showbread, the menorah, and the incense altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5334"><sup>159</sup> According to I.E., verse 43 should be paraphrased as follows: I will meet with the children of Israel in the tent of meeeting because the tent of meeting takes in the tabernacle and all of its utensils, the ark, the table of showbread, the menorah, and the incense altar. The tent of meeting shall be sanctified by My glory, which will rest on the cherubim. It should be noted that I.E.&#x2019;s comment is difficult to unravel, and the various commentaries offer differing interpretations and emendations. However, the above seems to be the correct interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5335"><sup>160</sup> Mentioned in verse 33.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5336"><sup>161</sup> In the temple courtyard.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5337"><sup>162</sup> By God&#x2019;s glory.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5338"><sup>163</sup> In other words, our verse adverts to the time when the camp of Israel will be set up in the form of a square with the tent of meeting in its center. Hence our verse speaks of God dwelling among the children of Israel. See Num. 2-4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5339"><sup>164</sup> Num. 2-4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5340"><sup>165</sup> I.E. assumed this, as Scripture does not explicitly so state. See I.E. on Deut. 23:10. According to Meijler, I.E. considers the space between the camp of the Levites and that of the Israelites as a barrier.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5341"><sup>166</sup> The tribe of Levi camped around the four sides of the tent of meeting.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5342"><sup>167</sup> For there was a separation between the camp of Israel and the tent of meeting. See Deut. 23:11.</ftnote>

<p>A PERPETUAL INCENSE. When they offer burnt offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn5374">26</xref></sup> Scripture therefore says, <italic>throughout your generations</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5375">27</xref></sup></p>

<p>12. [WHEN THOU TAKEST THE SUM.] Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn5384">36</xref></sup> begins to explain the law of the atonement money which each and every one is obligated to give. The atonement money was not a free will offering.<sup><xref rid="fn5385">37</xref></sup> Scripture makes mention of the atonement money here because it notes above<sup><xref rid="fn5386">38</xref></sup> that atonement shall be made [upon the horns of the altar of incense] once a year. The atonement money was, as I will explain, similarly to be given once a year.</p>
<p>The description of the laver and its base follow next<sup><xref rid="fn5387">39</xref></sup> because they are not to be made from free will gifts of the congregation but only from the mirrors of the women who performed tasks.<sup><xref rid="fn5388">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture also mentions the anointing oil<sup><xref rid="fn5389">41</xref></sup> and the sweet incense,<sup><xref rid="fn5390">42</xref></sup> for the princes alone brought them.<sup><xref rid="fn5391">43</xref></sup> Now since Scripture mentions the anointing oil it mentions the vessels which were anointed.<sup><xref rid="fn5392">44</xref></sup> Scripture also mentions the great craftsman, the perfumer,<sup><xref rid="fn5393">45</xref></sup> and the one whose counsel guided those who constructed the entire tabernacle, namely, Bezalel and Oholiab [who was with him].<sup><xref rid="fn5394">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture mentions the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn5395">47</xref></sup> in order to warn the Israelites at the beginning<sup><xref rid="fn5396">48</xref></sup> not to do God&#x2019;s work<sup><xref rid="fn5397">49</xref></sup> on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Scripture next<sup><xref rid="fn5398">50</xref></sup> records the prayer offered by Moses before he came down from the mountain. However, it first had to mention the making of the golden calf<sup><xref rid="fn5399">51</xref></sup> so that we would know why Moses prayed. Scripture then tells of Moses&#x2019; descent from the mountain,<sup><xref rid="fn5400">52</xref></sup> the burning of the calf,<sup><xref rid="fn5401">53</xref></sup> and Moses&#x2019; return to the mountain to pray for Israel a second time.<sup><xref rid="fn5402">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture mentions that Moses&#x2019; anger caused him to move his tent outside the camp of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn5403">55</xref></sup> However, some say that Scripture records what happened.<sup><xref rid="fn5404">56</xref></sup> Scripture then mentions Moses&#x2019; great glory, namely, that Moses saw God&#x2019;s glory.<sup><xref rid="fn5405">57</xref></sup> It tells us that God then commanded Moses to descend and hew out tablets.<sup><xref rid="fn5406">58</xref></sup> It informs us that God inscribed the tablets a second time.<sup><xref rid="fn5407">59</xref></sup> Scripture mentions<sup><xref rid="fn5408">60</xref></sup> the conditions upon which God made a treaty with Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn5409">61</xref></sup> These conditions are recorded in the Torah portion <italic>Ve-Ellaeh Ha-Mishpatim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5410">62</xref></sup> Scripture then mentions that the skin of Moses&#x2019; face shone when Moses came down from the mountain with the tablets of the covenant in his hand.<sup><xref rid="fn5411">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that the atonement money was an annual obligation upon Israel. It was obligatory whether their king counted them or not.<sup><xref rid="fn5412">64</xref></sup> Saadiah Gaon offers the census taken by Moses in the desert as proof.<sup><xref rid="fn5413">65</xref></sup> Saadiah says that the money collected was used for the congregational sacrifices, the construction of the laver, the making of the anointing oil, and the sweet incense. Part of it was also given to the Sanhedrin.<sup><xref rid="fn5414">66</xref></sup> Bezalel and Oholiab allude to this.<sup><xref rid="fn5415">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHEN THOU TAKEST THE SUM.]<sup><xref rid="fn5416">68</xref></sup> It is customary for the accountants who are intimate with the details of an account to itemize upon pages. However they write the sum of all the items<sup><xref rid="fn5417">69</xref></sup> at the head of the page.<sup><xref rid="fn5418">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that the plague which occurred in the days of David<sup><xref rid="fn5419">71</xref></sup> struck because Israel did not offer a ransom for their soul. If this is true it refutes the opinion of Saadiah Gaon.<sup><xref rid="fn5420">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHEN THOU NUMBEREST THEM.] The meaning of <italic>that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them</italic> is: if they do not give atonement money at the very moment of the numbering, a plague will strike. However, Yefet says it means that if they are numbered and do not give their ransom, they will fall before their enemies when they go to war.<sup><xref rid="fn5421">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. THIS. This amount. It is similar to <italic>And this thou shalt make it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5422">74</xref></sup> (Ex. 7:15).<sup><xref rid="fn5423">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>[EVERY ONE THAT PASSETH.] The meaning of <italic>every one that passeth</italic> is everyone who passes his twentieth year. Twenty years is about three weeks of years [almost twenty-one years].<sup><xref rid="fn5424">76</xref></sup> A person&#x2019;s mind is then fully developed. His body also no longer grows in height.<sup><xref rid="fn5425">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>[GERAHS.] These <italic>gerahs</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5426">78</xref></sup> refer to the pits of a carob.<sup><xref rid="fn5427">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. EVERY ONE&#x2026;THAT ARE NUMBERED. <italic>Pekudim</italic> (that are numbered) is active.<sup><xref rid="fn5428">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. THE RICH. Scripture explains why the rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less. The reason for this is that the money is an atonement for one&#x2019;s soul.<sup><xref rid="fn5429">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. AND THOU SHALT TAKE&#x2026;AND SHALT APPOINT IT FOR THE SERVICE OF THE TENT OF MEETING. This is explained in the Torah portion <italic>Ve-Ellah Pekude</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5430">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT IT MAY BE A MEMORIAL FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.] For the tabernacle stood only upon sockets which were made from the atonement money<sup><xref rid="fn5431">83</xref></sup> as a memorial for the children of Israel.</p>
<p>17. AND THE LORD SPOKE. A new section begins here.<sup><xref rid="fn5432">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND THE BASE THEREOF. <italic>Kanno</italic> means the base thereof.<sup><xref rid="fn5433">85</xref></sup> The bases that Solomon made<sup><xref rid="fn5434">86</xref></sup> proves this.<sup><xref rid="fn5435">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Scripture states that the laver was placed <italic>between the tent of meeting and the altar</italic>. This shows that the altar was not adjacent to the door of the tent but was close to it The altar was placed in the center<sup><xref rid="fn5436">88</xref></sup> and was aligned with the altar of incense.<sup><xref rid="fn5437">89</xref></sup> The laver was placed between the tent and the altar, towards one of the sides.<sup><xref rid="fn5438">90</xref></sup> However, Scripture does not mention this.<sup><xref rid="fn5439">91</xref></sup> It does not seem logical for the laver to be aligned with the altar of incense<sup><xref rid="fn5440">92</xref></sup> and thus be aligned with the ark cover.<sup><xref rid="fn5441">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. SHALL WASH. Scripture mentions that the laver was necessary because of those who served in the tabernacle, namely, Aaron and his sons and their descendants. Moses is not now mentioned, as Moses alone used the laver as long as he lived.<sup><xref rid="fn5442">94</xref></sup> However, Scripture mentions Moses&#x2019; use of the laver when it describes the actual setting up of the laver.<sup><xref rid="fn5443">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. WHEN THEY GO INTO THE TENT OF MEETING, THEY SHALL WASH WITH WATER. The meaning of <italic>yirchatzu mayim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5444">96</xref></sup> is they shall wash with water.<sup><xref rid="fn5445">97</xref></sup> The reason the hands and feet have to be washed is that they are the active parts of the body.<sup><xref rid="fn5446">98</xref></sup> There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn5447">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. MOREOVER THE LORD SPOKE. This is a section unto itself.<sup><xref rid="fn5448">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. TAKE THOU ALSO UNTO THEE. <italic>Kach lekha</italic> (take unto thee) is similar to <italic>lekh leha</italic> (get thee out) (Gen. 12:1) and <italic>u-kechu lakhem tzon</italic> (and take you lambs) (Ex. 12:21).<sup><xref rid="fn5449">101</xref></sup> According to the plain meaning of the text, <italic>aseh lekha saraf</italic> (make thee a fiery serpent) (Num. 21:8)<sup><xref rid="fn5450">102</xref></sup> and also <italic>pesal lekha</italic> (hew thee) (Ex. 34:1)<sup><xref rid="fn5451">103</xref></sup> are similar,<sup><xref rid="fn5452">104</xref></sup> for such is the way of the Hebrew language.<sup><xref rid="fn5453">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>[MYRRH.] The word <italic>mor</italic> (myrrh) is difficult.<sup><xref rid="fn5454">106</xref></sup> Saadiah Gaon translated it as musk. It thus does not come from trees<sup><xref rid="fn5455">107</xref></sup> even though it has a pleasant odor.<sup><xref rid="fn5456">108</xref></sup> Perhaps this is the reason Scripture separates it from the spices. For Scripture states, <italic>I have gathered my myrrh with my spice</italic> (Cant. 5:1). Myrrh is thus gathered.<sup><xref rid="fn5457">109</xref></sup> Those who provide musk say that it is produced in the throat of a deer.<sup><xref rid="fn5458">110</xref></sup> Behold,<sup><xref rid="fn5459">111</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>And my hands dropped with myrrh</italic> (Cant. 5:5).<sup><xref rid="fn5460">112</xref></sup> Perhaps this is the case when the myrrh is wet.<sup><xref rid="fn5461">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE CHIEF SPICES.] Scripture reads <italic>besamim rosh</italic> (the chief spices)<sup><xref rid="fn5462">114</xref></sup> to indicate that the top of each spice<sup><xref rid="fn5463">115</xref></sup> is to be taken. The top of the spice is of a much better quality than that which remains at the end.</p>
<p>[AND OF SWEET CINNAMON.]<sup><xref rid="fn5464">116</xref></sup> Having said <italic>kinnemon</italic> (cinnamon), what reason is there for Scripture to add <italic>besem</italic> (sweet)?<sup><xref rid="fn5465">117</xref></sup> It is possible that Scripture reads, <italic>ve-kinnemon besem</italic>, because the cinnamon had to be of the best quality. The same also applies to the calamus.<sup><xref rid="fn5466">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>[HALF SO MUCH, EVEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY.] The ancients, of blessed memory, said that all the ingredients were of equal weight.<sup><xref rid="fn5467">119</xref></sup> We will accept what they say. However, we do not know why Scripture says, <italic>half so much even two hundred and fifty</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5468">120</xref></sup> I do not understand the reason for the halves<sup><xref rid="fn5469">121</xref></sup> for it is the practice in all of the lands of the Ishmaelites not to add even the weight of a mustard seed to anything being weighed. They most certainly do not add anything to any ingredient used in the work of a perfumer.<sup><xref rid="fn5470">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. CASSIA. We know from tradition<sup><xref rid="fn5471">123</xref></sup> that <italic>kiddah</italic> is cassia.</p>
<p>25. AND THOU SHALT MAKE IT&#x2026;A PERFUME COMPOUNDED AFTER THE ART OF THE PERFUMER. <italic>Rokach mirkachat</italic> (a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer) is similar to <italic>miktar ketoret</italic> (to burn incense) (v. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn5472">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IT SHALL BE A HOLY ANOINTING OIL.] This is what Scripture refers to next.<sup><xref rid="fn5473">125</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. AND THOU SHALT ANOINT THEREWITH THE TENT OF MEETING. This includes the entire tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn5474">126</xref></sup> Our verse mentions the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn5475">127</xref></sup> the most important object in the tent of meeting.</p>
<p>27. AND THE TABLE. The table is mentioned first<sup><xref rid="fn5476">128</xref></sup> because it was the largest [object in the sanctuary] and it had many utensils. Scripture then mentions the menorah, which had many utensils.</p>
<p>28. AND THE ALTAR OF BURNT-OFFERING. It had many vessels.<sup><xref rid="fn5477">129</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND THOU SHALT SANCTIFY. With the anointing oil.</p>
<p>[WHATSOEVER TOUCHETH THEM SHALL BE HOLY.] We can derive the meaning of <italic>whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy</italic> from <italic>If one bear hallowed flesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5478">130</xref></sup> (Haggai 2:12), which, according to the plain meaning of the text, is be taken literally.<sup><xref rid="fn5479">131</xref></sup> The verse<sup><xref rid="fn5480">132</xref></sup> teaches: if holy flesh touches bread, pottage, wine, oil, or any food it<sup><xref rid="fn5481">133</xref></sup> becomes holy. The same applies to the altar of burnt offering,<sup><xref rid="fn5482">134</xref></sup> as Scripture also uses the term &#x201C;most holy&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn5483">135</xref></sup> regarding it.<sup><xref rid="fn5484">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. AND THOU SHALT ANOINT AARON AND HIS SONS. Alone, no one else.<sup><xref rid="fn5485">137</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. THIS SHALL BE A HOLY ANOINTING OIL. All oil made according to this composition shall be used to anoint the seed of Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn5486">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. SHALL IT NOT BE POURED. Rabbi Merinus<sup><xref rid="fn5487">139</xref></sup> says that <italic>yisakh</italic> (poured)<sup><xref rid="fn5488">140</xref></sup> has the same meaning as <italic>yusakh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5489">141</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>va-yisem</italic> (he was put)<sup><xref rid="fn5490">142</xref></sup> in <italic>and he was put in a coffin</italic> (Gen. 50: 26) has the same meaning as <italic>va-yusam</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5491">143</xref></sup></p>
<p>[UPON THE FLESH OF MAN SHALL IT NOT BE POURED.] Scripture states, <italic>Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured</italic> because it was customary in Israel for men and also for women to anoint themselves with oil. For Scripture states, <italic>but thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil</italic> (Deut. 28:40). It is prohibited for a priest and certainly for anyone else to anoint themselves with this oil, for the anointing oil was poured upon the head of the anointed.<sup><xref rid="fn5492">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>ACCORDING TO THE COMPOSITION THEREOF. Oil composed of the exact amount of the above-listed<sup><xref rid="fn5493">145</xref></sup> spices.</p>
<p>33. WHOSOEVER. The meaning of <italic>or whosoever putteth any of it on a stranger</italic> (zar) is: or whosoever putteth any of it on someone who is not of Aaron&#x2019;s family.<sup><xref rid="fn5494">146</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon, of blessed memory, says that Israel had a tradition that David and his seed should be anointed with the anointing oil. Other kings were not to be so anointed. The Gaon was compelled to explain thus because Zadok<sup><xref rid="fn5495">147</xref></sup> took some of the anointing oil that was in the tent of meeting and used it to anoint Solomon.<sup><xref rid="fn5496">148</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yefet says that <italic>on a stranger</italic> means on someone who is not an Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn5497">149</xref></sup> However, he was mistaken, for Scripture states, <italic>and the stranger</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5498">150</xref></sup> (zar) <italic>that draweth nigh shall be put to death</italic> (Num. 3:10). The meaning of the latter is: <italic>To the end that no stranger</italic> (zar), <italic>that is not of the seed of Aaron, draw near</italic> (Num. 17:5).<sup><xref rid="fn5499">151</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say<sup><xref rid="fn5500">152</xref></sup> that this law<sup><xref rid="fn5501">153</xref></sup> refers only to the oil made by Moses. However, this also does not appear to me to be correct. For Scripture first states, <italic>This shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations</italic> (v. 31).<sup><xref rid="fn5502">154</xref></sup> Furthermore, the Pentateuch states (v. 33), <italic>Whosoever, compoundeth any like it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn5503">155</xref></sup> <italic>or whosoever putteth any of</italic> &#x201C;a similarly compounded oil&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn5504">156</xref></sup> <italic>upon a stranger</italic>. Thus there is no difference between the anointing oil made by Moses and its duplicate which was made later.</p>
<p>Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn5505">157</xref></sup> does not state, &#x201C;except for the family of David.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn5506">158</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that all the commandments are obligatory on all the generations of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn5507">159</xref></sup> The law stating that no burnt offering should be offered in any but the chosen place<sup><xref rid="fn5508">160</xref></sup> is an example.<sup><xref rid="fn5509">161</xref></sup> Nevertheless, we find that Gideon,<sup><xref rid="fn5510">162</xref></sup> Samuel,<sup><xref rid="fn5511">163</xref></sup> and also Elijah at Mount Carmel<sup><xref rid="fn5512">164</xref></sup> brought burnt offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn5513">165</xref></sup> I mentioned Gideon<sup><xref rid="fn5514">166</xref></sup> because he offered burnt offerings even though he was not a priest.<sup><xref rid="fn5515">167</xref></sup> The same is true of Samuel.<sup><xref rid="fn5516">168</xref></sup> The fact that he was descended from Korah<sup><xref rid="fn5517">169</xref></sup> is of no avail. These acts were all based on temporary [<italic>ad hoc</italic>] rulings.<sup><xref rid="fn5518">170</xref></sup> We can say the same also with regard to Solomon. Solomon was anointed with the anointing oil on the temporary ruling of the prophet Nathan or Gad.</p>
<p>34. TAKE UNTO THEE SWEET SPICES. The ancients,<sup><xref rid="fn5519">171</xref></sup> of blessed memory, received a tradition that there were eleven types of spices.<sup><xref rid="fn5520">172</xref></sup> Now the verse<sup><xref rid="fn5521">173</xref></sup> that notes that spices were to be used in the sweet incense<sup><xref rid="fn5522">174</xref></sup> does not list the spices that were to be used in the sweet incense. Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn5523">175</xref></sup> mentions the sweet spices.<sup><xref rid="fn5524">176</xref></sup> However, Scripture does not mention their weight.<sup><xref rid="fn5525">177</xref></sup></p>
<p>[SWEET SPICES.] Scripture mentions <italic>sammim</italic> (sweet spices) a second time<sup><xref rid="fn5526">178</xref></sup> because it wants to say: take the aforementioned sweet spices,<sup><xref rid="fn5527">179</xref></sup> and along with them, take pure frankincense.</p>
<p>OF EACH SHALL THERE BE A LIKE WEIGHT. Each spice to be compounded by itself.<sup><xref rid="fn5528">180</xref></sup> It shall then be mixed.<sup><xref rid="fn5529">181</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. AND THOU SHALT MAKE&#x2026;SEASONED WITH SALT. <italic>Memullach</italic> (seasoned with salt) means seasoned with salt from Sodom.<sup><xref rid="fn5530">182</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>memullach</italic> means thinly ground. Or it is related<sup><xref rid="fn5531">183</xref></sup> to the word <italic>melechah</italic> (salt) in <italic>A salt land</italic> (<italic>Jer.</italic> 17:6).<sup><xref rid="fn5532">184</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. AND THOU SHALT BEAT SOME OF IT VERY SMALL. As thin as you are able to make it.<sup><xref rid="fn5533">185</xref></sup> This is the perpetual incense<sup><xref rid="fn5534">186</xref></sup> which was offered on the golden altar.</p>
<p>37. AND THE INCENSE WHICH THOU SHALT MAKE. This<sup><xref rid="fn5535">187</xref></sup> alludes to Moses.</p>
<p>YE SHALL NOT MAKE. Israel is being spoken to.<sup><xref rid="fn5536">188</xref></sup></p>
<p>IT SHALL BE UNTO THEE HOLY. The priest, or all of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn5537">189</xref></sup> <italic>Remember the days of old</italic> (Deut. 32:7) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn5538">190</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. WHOSOEVER. Scripture first warns.<sup><xref rid="fn5539">191</xref></sup> It then mentions the punishment,<sup><xref rid="fn5540">192</xref></sup> as is the law.<sup><xref rid="fn5541">193</xref></sup></p>

I.E.&#x2019;s comment is based on Ex. 25:6, which reads, <italic>spices</italic> (besammim) <italic>for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense</italic> (ketoret sammim).

<ftnote id="fn5415"><sup>67</sup> Ex. 31:1-11 tells us that Bezalel and Oholiab were given the charge of constructing the tabernacle.

<ftnote id="fn5420"><sup>72</sup> According to Saadiah there was an annual obligation to give half a shekel as a ransom for one&#x2019;s soul. Now if this is an annual obligation it is highly unlikely that David forgot to collect it when he counted the people (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5421"><sup>73</sup> In other words, that <italic>there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them</italic> refers to defeat by their enemies.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5439"><sup>91</sup> Scripture does not mention the place of the laver (Weiser). Or, Scripture does not mention that the laver was off center (Meijler). According to Filwarg and Krinsky, I.E. discusses the altar mentioned in our verse. Scripture states, <italic>and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar</italic>. However, it does not identify which altar it is referring to. I.E. points out that the reference is to the altar of the burnt offering, for it is illogical to assume that the laver was placed in the sanctuary between the tent of meeting and the altar of incense.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5440"><sup>92</sup> This would be the case if the laver was placed directly between the altar and the opening of the tent of meeting.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5451"><sup>103</sup> According to the rabbis the word <italic>lekha</italic> indicates that Moses was to keep the chips from the tablets. See <italic>Nedarim</italic> 37b, <italic>pesolatan shelkha yehe</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5465"><sup>117</sup> In other words, the phrase <italic>ve-kinnemon besem</italic> is redundant, for <italic>kinnemon</italic> is a type of spice (bosem).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5466"><sup>118</sup> Scripture reads, <italic>u-keneh bosem</italic> (and sweet calamus). The same question that was raised regarding <italic>ve-kinnemon besem</italic> can be raised here; i.e., having stated <italic>keneh</italic>, why add <italic>bosem</italic>?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5467"><sup>119</sup> Each type of spice used in the anointing oil weighed 500 <italic>shekalim</italic>. See <italic>Keritot</italic> 5a. Krinsky points out that the Rabbinic comment applied only to cinnamon and not to calamus, for according to the rabbis 250 <italic>shekalim</italic>-weight of calamus was used in the anointing oil. See <italic>Keritot</italic> 5a. Krinsky tries to limit I.E.&#x2019;s remarks to the cinnamon. However, he admits that he is pressing the point, for I.E. reads &#x201C;all,&#x201D; and the meaning of &#x201C;all&#x201D; is all the ingredients.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5468"><sup>120</sup> If 500 <italic>shekalim</italic> of sweet cinnamon was used.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5469"><sup>121</sup> That is, why the cinnamon was brought in two halves, each consisting of 250 <italic>shekalim</italic>. According to the rabbis, the reason for bringing the cinnamon in two halves was to gain the overweights. We thus read, &#x201C;Said Rabbi Judah: Why are the five hundred shekels of sweet cinnamon taken in two portions of two hundred and fifty each? Since the total quantity is five hundred, why not bring the whole at a time? From the fact that the cinnamon is brought in two portions we may infer that there was an overweight each time (that is, the division was for the purpose of adding a greater overweight of cinnamon)&#x201D; (<italic>Keritot</italic> 5a, Soncino translation).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5470"><sup>122</sup> I.E. assumes that what was common practice in his day was also common practice in Rabbinic times.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5471"><sup>123</sup> <italic>Keritot</italic> 6a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5472"><sup>124</sup> <italic>Rokach</italic> is an infinitive in the form of a noun. So is <italic>miktar</italic> (see I.E. on verse 1). Thus <italic>rokach mirkachat</italic> means to make a perfume. See I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary on Exodus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5473"><sup>125</sup> The next verse reads, <italic>And thou shalt anoint therewith. Therewith</italic> refers to the anointing oil.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5523"><sup>175</sup> In our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5524"><sup>176</sup> Hebrew, <italic>sammim</italic>. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that Scripture does not at all mention the spices (<italic>besamim</italic>) used in the sweet incense.

<ftnote id="fn5525"><sup>177</sup> Meijler. Their weight is given by tradition. Thus even with regard to the spices (<italic>sammim</italic>) we need tradition.</ftnote>

It is possibly related to the word <italic>melechah</italic> (salt) in <italic>A salt land</italic> (Jer. 17:6). Krinsky renders, <italic>A salt land</italic>, a cut-off land. He explains, &#x201C;Or it is related to the word <italic>melechah</italic> (salt) in <italic>A salt land</italic> as follows: <italic>Memullach</italic> means cut off from profane use, as it is related to the word <italic>melechah</italic> in Jer. 17:6.

<ftnote id="fn5535"><sup>187</sup> The word <italic>thou</italic> alludes to Moses.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5537"><sup>189</sup> <italic>Lekha</italic> (unto thee) refers either to the priest or to all of Israel. <italic>Lekha</italic> is a singular. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5538"><sup>190</sup> In Deuteronomy 32:7, Moses addresses Israel and tells them: Remember (<italic>zekhor</italic>) the days of old.

We thus see that Scripture often switches from the singular to the plural without any change in person.

<p>[BEZALEL THE SON OF URI, THE SON OF HUR.] According to the plain meaning of the text, Caleb the son of Jephunneh<sup><xref rid="fn5551">10</xref></sup> is not to be identified with Caleb the son of Hezron.<sup><xref rid="fn5552">11</xref></sup> There is indisputable evidence that this is so.<sup><xref rid="fn5553">12</xref></sup> Intelligent people will understand the proof.</p>
<p>3. AND I HAVE FILLED HIM. This is similar to <italic>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom</italic> (Deut. 34:9).</p>
<p>[AND I HAVE FILLED HIM WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD, IN WISDOM, AND IN UNDERSTANDING.] Scripture states, <italic>And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him</italic> (Is. 11:2). It then goes on to explain that the spirit of the Lord is <italic>The spirit of wisdom and understanding</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).</p>
<p>Wisdom (<italic>chokhmah</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn5554">13</xref></sup> refers to the type of intelligence that is stored in the back of the brain.<sup><xref rid="fn5555">14</xref></sup> The word <italic>tevunah</italic> (understanding) and also the word <italic>binah</italic> (reason)<sup><xref rid="fn5556">15</xref></sup> are related to the word <italic>ben</italic> (between). They<sup><xref rid="fn5557">16</xref></sup> refer to the intellectual faculty that lies in the middle cavity of the brain between knowledge<sup><xref rid="fn5558">17</xref></sup> and wisdom.<sup><xref rid="fn5559">18</xref></sup> For wisdom is situated in the posterior cavity of the brain, and knowledge, which is gathered by the senses, is located in the cavities of the brain that are adjacent to the forehead. Knowledge is called <italic>al takyil</italic> in Arabic. Understanding is called <italic>al fakrah</italic> and wisdom <italic>al hakhmah</italic>.</p>
<p>Now Bezalel was endowed with every wisdom. He mastered the science of mathematics, geometry, proportions,<sup><xref rid="fn5560">19</xref></sup> astronomy, biology, and the secret of the human soul.<sup><xref rid="fn5561">20</xref></sup> He also towered over the people of his generation in that he knew all manner of workmanship.<sup><xref rid="fn5562">21</xref></sup> Many intelligent people do not possess even one practical skill. Hence Scripture prefixes a <italic>vav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5563">22</xref></sup> to the word <italic>kol</italic> (and) and reads, <italic>u-vekhol melakhah</italic> (and in all manner of workmanship).<sup><xref rid="fn5564">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. WITH HIM. Equal to him in workmanship but not in the science of cutting.<sup><xref rid="fn5565">24</xref></sup> Observe, the meaning of <italic>and in all manner of workmanship</italic> is (v. 3) <italic>to devise skilful works</italic> (v. 4).<sup><xref rid="fn5566">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND IN THE HEARTS OF ALL THAT ARE WISE-HEARTED I HAVE PUT WISDOM. To do work.<sup><xref rid="fn5567">26</xref></sup> Also one finds in human nature the ability to devise intricate geometric forms without ever having studied this science.<sup><xref rid="fn5568">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THAT THEY MAY MAKE ALL THAT I HAVE COMMANDED.] Scripture now goes on to mention all the objects which they were required to make.</p>
<p>7. THE TENT OF MEETING. Scripture starts with the tent of meeting because it includes everything in the tabernacle. It mentions the ark and the ark cover because of their great importance.</p>
<p>AND ALL THE FURNITURE OF THE TENT. The curtain, the veil, the boards, and the bars. It mentions the table<sup><xref rid="fn5569">28</xref></sup> in accordance with what I have already noted.<sup><xref rid="fn5570">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND THE PLAITED GARMENTS. The <italic>bigde ha-serad</italic> (the plaited garments) were garments used to cover the ark, the table, the altar, [and] the menorah when journeying.<sup><xref rid="fn5571">30</xref></sup> Scripture goes on to explain, <italic>And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made plaited garments</italic> (bigde serad) (Ex. 39:1). Each is listed separately<sup><xref rid="fn5572">31</xref></sup> as the Torah portion <italic>Ba-Midbar Sinai</italic> (Num. 4:6-14) states.</p>
<p>Scripture then states, [<italic>And of the blue, and purple, and the scarlet</italic>] <italic>they made plaited garments&#x2026;and</italic> [they] <italic>made the holy garments</italic> [<italic>for Aaron</italic>] (Ex. 39:1). It then goes on to list them.<sup><xref rid="fn5573">32</xref></sup> Observe&#x0021; The word <italic>serad</italic> is related to the word <italic>sarid</italic> (remain) in <italic>escape or remain</italic> (Jer. 44:14).<sup><xref rid="fn5574">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. FOR THE HOLY PLACE. They are for the need of the holy place.<sup><xref rid="fn5575">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. SAYING. Every time the word <italic>lemor</italic> (saying) is used with <italic>va-yedabber</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5576">35</xref></sup> (he spoke),<sup><xref rid="fn5577">36</xref></sup> its meaning is, saying to him.<sup><xref rid="fn5578">37</xref></sup> Here<sup><xref rid="fn5579">38</xref></sup> its meaning is, to tell Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn5580">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. THOU. Since God commanded Israel to construct the tabernacle, Israel might think that they should occupy themselves with the construction of the tabernacle on the Sabbath. Hence Scripture states, <italic>Verily</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5581">40</xref></sup><italic>ye shall keep My sabbaths</italic>.</p>
<p>One of the great sages said that it is well-known that only one Sabbath is God&#x2019;s Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn5582">41</xref></sup> Now, if this is so, then what is the meaning of <italic>My sabbaths</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn5583">42</xref></sup> He answered that the world will exist for six thousand years.<sup><xref rid="fn5584">43</xref></sup> The seventh millennium and also the Sabbatical year are thus Sabbaths. However, <italic>My sabbaths</italic> refers to the many Sabbaths of the year.<sup><xref rid="fn5585">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that we do not find the term <italic>shabbat</italic> used with reference to the festivals.<sup><xref rid="fn5586">45</xref></sup> The term used is <italic>shabbaton</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5587">46</xref></sup> (a solemn rest).<sup><xref rid="fn5588">47</xref></sup> There is a controversy<sup><xref rid="fn5589">48</xref></sup> regarding the meaning of <italic>from the morrow after the sabbath</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5590">49</xref></sup> (Lev. 23:15).<sup><xref rid="fn5591">50</xref></sup> The traditional interpretation is correct. However, as I will explain in its place, it requires interpretation.<sup><xref rid="fn5592">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Day of Atonement is called Israel&#x2019;s Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn5593">52</xref></sup> not God&#x2019;s Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn5594">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR IT IS A SIGN. I will explain at the end of the chapter what the Sabbath signifies.</p>
<p>WHO SANCTIFY YOU. When you sanctify the Sabbath, which I sanctified, and refrain from doing any work on the Sabbath day.<sup><xref rid="fn5595">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. YE SHALL KEEP THE SABBATH&#x2026;EVERY ONE THAT PROFANETH IT SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH. <italic>Mot yumat</italic> (he shall surely be put to death) means: it is possible he will be put to death.<sup><xref rid="fn5596">55</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>and its owner also shall be put to death</italic> (Ex. 21:29).<sup><xref rid="fn5597">56</xref></sup> The verse stating I [God] will cut off <italic>whosoever doeth any work</italic> on the Sabbath in secret or in front of a<sup><xref rid="fn5598">57</xref></sup> witness<sup><xref rid="fn5599">58</xref></sup> is proof of the above.<sup><xref rid="fn5600">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. SIX DAYS. Scripture goes on to explain that they are permitted to do work on the other six days of the week.<sup><xref rid="fn5601">60</xref></sup> The word <italic>ye&#x2019;aseh</italic> (shall be done)<sup><xref rid="fn5602">61</xref></sup> governs the word <italic>melakhah</italic> (work).<sup><xref rid="fn5603">62</xref></sup> Perhaps the word <italic>kol</italic> (any)<sup><xref rid="fn5604">63</xref></sup> or <italic>devar ma&#x2019;aseh</italic> (an act of)<sup><xref rid="fn5605">64</xref></sup> is missing. Now its meaning is, you shall kill him if he does work in public.<sup><xref rid="fn5606">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. SHALL KEEP. They shall keep count of the days of the week so that they do not forget which day is the Sabbath. One shall set his affairs in order and take care of his needs on the sixth day so that he will keep the Sabbath and not desecrate it. The meaning of <italic>la&#x2019;asot</italic> (to observe)<sup><xref rid="fn5607">66</xref></sup> in <italic>la&#x2019;asot et ha-shabbat</italic> (to observe the Sabbath) is thus similar<sup><xref rid="fn5608">67</xref></sup> to the meaning of <italic>la&#x2019;asot</italic> (to dress) in <italic>and he hastened to dress</italic> (la&#x2019;asot) <italic>it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5609">68</xref></sup> (Gen. 18:7).</p>
<p>17. IT IS A SIGN BETWEEN ME AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. Scripture employs the terms covenant<sup><xref rid="fn5610">69</xref></sup> and sign<sup><xref rid="fn5611">70</xref></sup> with regard to circumcision.<sup><xref rid="fn5612">71</xref></sup> It does the same with regard to the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn5613">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says: When people find a male circumcised in such a way that the glans penis is uncovered,<sup><xref rid="fn5614">73</xref></sup> then they will know that he is an Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn5615">74</xref></sup> Similarly when a person refrains from doing any work or engaging in business on the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn5616">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, I believe that the meaning of <italic>It is a sign</italic> is, <italic>for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5617">76</xref></sup> Thus the one who does work on the Sabbath denies the work of creation.</p>
<p>[FOR IN SIX DAYS THE LORD MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH, AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE CEASED FROM WORK AND RESTED.] The Torah employs human language so that those who hear its words will understand. Scripture&#x2019;s statement,<sup><xref rid="fn5618">77</xref></sup> <italic>And rested</italic>, is to be taken metaphorically because <italic>God&#x2026;fainteth not, neither is weary</italic> (Is. 40:28).<sup><xref rid="fn5619">78</xref></sup> Look, the hosts of heaven, namely, the glorious corporeal entities<sup><xref rid="fn5620">79</xref></sup> which God created, circle the sky day and night eternally.<sup><xref rid="fn5621">80</xref></sup> This is certainly the case with the glorious incorporeal entities.<sup><xref rid="fn5622">81</xref></sup> It is most certainly true of the Creator of all, Who Inhabits eternity (Is. 57:15), and <italic>is enthroned of old</italic> (Ps. 55:20), who does all by command without any movement on His part.</p>
<p>18. AND HE GAVE. Empty heads ask, &#x201C;What did Moses do on the mount for forty days and forty nights?&#x201D; They do not know that if Moses spent this number and double its double in years with God, he would barely know one part of a thousand of God&#x2019;s work and ways and the secret of all the precepts which God commanded him. They think that deeds are most important.<sup><xref rid="fn5623">82</xref></sup> This is not so. What is important is heart together with deed.<sup><xref rid="fn5624">83</xref></sup> Heart and tongue train a person [to observe the commandments].<sup><xref rid="fn5625">84</xref></sup> We thus read, <italic>in thy mouth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn5626">85</xref></sup> <italic>and in thy heart</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn5627">86</xref></sup> <italic>that thou mayest do it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5628">87</xref></sup> (Deut. 30:14). Our ancients said, &#x201C;God desires the heart.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn5629">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>Loving God and cleaving to the Lord with all of one&#x2019;s soul is the basis of the commandments. This cannot be completely accomplished if a person does not know the ways of the Lord and is not acquainted with God&#x2019;s work in the upper and lower worlds. The prophet thus states, <italic>But let him that glorieth glory in this, That he understandeth and knoweth Me</italic> (Jer. 9:23). It will then become clear to a person that God exercises <italic>mercy, Justice, and righteous, in the earth</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).<sup><xref rid="fn5630">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>A person cannot know God if he does not know his own spirit, soul, and body. For of what use is a person&#x2019;s wisdom to him if he does not know the makeup of his soul?</p>
<p>Now Moses, who prophesied in the desert for forty years and was party to many secrets which God revealed to him on Mount Sinai, said before his death, <italic>O Lord God, Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness</italic> (Deut. 3:24). Thus it was only then that Moses began to understand God&#x2019;s greatness and that the Lord&#x2019;s greatness was shown to him. This is truth,<sup><xref rid="fn5631">90</xref></sup> for <italic>His greatness is unsearchable</italic> (Ps. 145:3).</p>
<p>TABLES OF STONE. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn5632">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WITH THE FINGER OF GOD.] Scripture&#x2019;s statement <italic>with the finger of God</italic> is an anthropomorphism,<sup><xref rid="fn5633">92</xref></sup> for the Lord&#x2019;s will is accomplished by the word coming out of God&#x2019;s mouth. God&#x2019;s mouth is employed metaphorically. God is said to act like human kings. This is how <italic>For He commanded, and they were created</italic> (Ps. 118:27) is to be understood.<sup><xref rid="fn5634">93</xref></sup> God&#x2019;s words appear to man to be standing in heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn5635">94</xref></sup> Scripture clearly states, <italic>Thy word standeth fast in heaven</italic> (Ps. 119:89).<sup><xref rid="fn5636">95</xref></sup> The intelligent will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn5637">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abraham the author says: I must dwell at length<sup><xref rid="fn5638">97</xref></sup> on the incident of the golden calf. Some of the ancients said that Hur<sup><xref rid="fn5639">98</xref></sup> was killed.<sup><xref rid="fn5640">99</xref></sup> Aaron thus was afraid.<sup><xref rid="fn5641">100</xref></sup> There is an opinion<sup><xref rid="fn5642">101</xref></sup> that Aaron feared for Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn5643">102</xref></sup> that if they killed him God in return would destroy all of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn5644">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>Let us now turn to the plain meaning of the text. If the making of the golden calf entailed idolatry, why was Aaron afraid that he would be killed?<sup><xref rid="fn5645">104</xref></sup> Did not many pious Israelites of later generations, whose level of piety did not even reach to the bottom of the sole of Aaron&#x2019;s foot, die for the sake of the unity of God&#x2019;s name? Look&#x0021; Daniel&#x2019;s companions were thrown into a fiery furnace because they refused to bow before an image.<sup><xref rid="fn5646">105</xref></sup> How then could Aaron make an idol, which is worse than bowing down to it? Was not Aaron one of God&#x2019;s holy people? Was he not a prophet to Israel?</p>
<p>Many commandments were given by him and his brother Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn5647">106</xref></sup> If Aaron was afraid to die<sup><xref rid="fn5648">107</xref></sup> then Hur was superior to him. If Aaron made an idol then Moses was obligated to kill him before he killed those who worshipped the calf. However, Moses prayed for Aaron and killed the worshippers. How could Aaron and his seed later on, for all eternity, make atonement for the children of Israel?<sup><xref rid="fn5649">108</xref></sup> Do not pay attention to <italic>Take thee a bull-calf</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5650">109</xref></sup> <italic>for a sin-offering</italic> (Lev. 9:2), for the bull-calf was not brought because Aaron made the golden calf. On the Day of Atonement all anointed priests<sup><xref rid="fn5651">110</xref></sup> are similarly commanded to bring a young bullock for a sin offering.<sup><xref rid="fn5652">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>We cannot say that the bullock was brought because of their father&#x2019;s sin,<sup><xref rid="fn5653">112</xref></sup> because all the priests were descended from Eleazar and Ithamar.<sup><xref rid="fn5654">113</xref></sup> Phinehas<sup><xref rid="fn5655">114</xref></sup> was also already born by the time the golden calf was made.<sup><xref rid="fn5656">115</xref></sup> Furthermore, the portion dealing with the laws of the Day of Atonement commands Israel to bring a he-goat for a sin offering.<sup><xref rid="fn5657">116</xref></sup> Now Israel did not make an image in the form of a he-goat.<sup><xref rid="fn5658">117</xref></sup> The red heifer<sup><xref rid="fn5659">118</xref></sup> similarly was not brought to atone for idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn5660">119</xref></sup> It was brought to purify the unclean.</p>
<p>All philosophers admit that God will not choose a person whom He knows will ultimately worship idols to serve as His messenger.<sup><xref rid="fn5661">120</xref></sup> Not every prophet is a messenger.<sup><xref rid="fn5662">121</xref></sup> Now Scripture tells us that shortly before Moses died, he said, <italic>Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one</italic> (Deut. 33:8).<sup><xref rid="fn5663">122</xref></sup> However, he did not mention the incident of the calf.<sup><xref rid="fn5664">123</xref></sup> The only sin found in Aaron was the sin found in Moses, which was the incident of the waters of Meribah,<sup><xref rid="fn5665">124</xref></sup> which I will explain in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn5666">125</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that Israel fooled Aaron. Israel made a mold of a calf. Aaron was unaware of this and cast the gold into the fire. They offer as proof, <italic>I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf</italic> (Deut. 32:24). However, this is incorrect, for if Aaron was a fool whom simpletons could deceive, why would God have chosen him? Furthermore, why did Aaron build an altar before the calf and command that Israel slaughter sacrifices and burnt offerings upon it?<sup><xref rid="fn5667">126</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that the individual named Aaron who made the calf was not Aaron the brother of Moses. This too is nonsense, for the congregation that gathered,<sup><xref rid="fn5668">127</xref></sup> only gathered against the one who stood in place of Moses. Scripture clearly states, behold, <italic>Aaron and Hur are with you</italic> (Ex. 24:14).<sup><xref rid="fn5669">128</xref></sup> If the one who made the calf was someone else named Aaron, why didn&#x2019;t Aaron kill him? Why didn&#x2019;t Moses kill him when he came down from the mountain? Moses even prayed on his behalf.<sup><xref rid="fn5670">129</xref></sup> It is not fitting for a pious man to make an idol for others so that they do not die.<sup><xref rid="fn5671">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are also many who say that the meaning of <italic>Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord</italic> (Ex. 32:5) is that those who served the calf would be killed by Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn5672">131</xref></sup> But the meaning of <italic>Tomorrow shall be a feast</italic> (chag) <italic>to the Lord</italic> can only mean that after Aaron built the altar before the calf, he commanded that an announcement be made in the camp that they should slaughter sacrifices the next day on the altar which he built. The meaning of <italic>chag</italic> (feast) is a sacrifice, as in <italic>bind the offering with thick ropes</italic> (Ps. 118:27).<sup><xref rid="fn5673">132</xref></sup> This is what Israel did, for we read, <italic>and they arose early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings</italic> (Ex. 31:6).</p>
<p>Thoughts are of no avail,<sup><xref rid="fn5674">133</xref></sup> for one who curses God is killed for what he said.<sup><xref rid="fn5675">134</xref></sup> The case is the same with a person who says, <italic>Let us go and serve other gods</italic> (Deut. 13:7).<sup><xref rid="fn5676">135</xref></sup> The one who explains <italic>I am Esau thy first-born</italic> (Gen. 27:19) as meaning, I am what I am, but Esau is your first-born, is not offering the plain meaning of the text. Neither is he explaining the text in accordance with the rules of rhetoric.<sup><xref rid="fn5677">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>If a person asks his neighbor in a law court, &#x201C;Are you the one to whom I lent the following sum of money?&#x201D; and his neighbor responds, &#x201C;I am,&#x201D; he cannot later say, &#x201C;What I meant was, I am his neighbor.&#x201D; The same also applies to what Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar: <italic>My lord, the dream</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5678">137</xref></sup> <italic>be to them that hate thee</italic> (Dan. 4:16).<sup><xref rid="fn5679">138</xref></sup> Daniel spoke according to the rules of etiquette.<sup><xref rid="fn5680">139</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will now cite for you the opinion of the Gaon. Rabbi Saadiah said that Aaron, like Jehu, acted with guile.<sup><xref rid="fn5681">140</xref></sup> Hence Aaron built the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn5682">141</xref></sup> Saadiah Gaon raised the following question against his own interpretation: &#x201C;If Aaron acted with guile, then why was God angry with him?&#x201D; The Gaon answered that God was angry with Aaron because he did not immediately kill those who worshipped the calf, as Moses did when he arrived.</p>
<p>However, this too is incorrect, for Aaron called out, <italic>Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord</italic> (YHVH) (32:5). Aaron employed the name <italic>YHVH</italic>. This name is a proper noun in honor of the Lord. It is not used for any other being.<sup><xref rid="fn5683">142</xref></sup> It is not like the name <italic>Elohim</italic> (God), which is used in many different ways. Furthermore, why didn&#x2019;t Aaron mention this when he responded to Moses?<sup><xref rid="fn5684">143</xref></sup> For Aaron said, <italic>I cast it into the fire</italic> (Ex. 32:24). Aaron&#x2019;s answer is not in keeping with the question.<sup><xref rid="fn5685">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will now begin to briefly explain part of the secret.<sup><xref rid="fn5686">145</xref></sup> Far be it, far be it for Aaron to make an idol. Israel also did not ask for an idol. What happened was that Israel thought that Moses, who, as I have explained, had led them on their journey from the Red Sea, had died,<sup><xref rid="fn5687">146</xref></sup> for Israel noticed that the manna did not come down at Mount Sinai. Furthermore, Moses tarried on the mountain for forty days. A human being does not have the stamina to live that long without food. Also, Moses did not tell them when he would descend.<sup><xref rid="fn5688">147</xref></sup> Moses himself did not know this, for God told him, &#x201C;Come up to Me onto the mount and be there until I give you the tablets of stone.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn5689">148</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word <italic>elohim</italic> (god) refers to a glorious being dwelling in an image of a body.<sup><xref rid="fn5690">149</xref></sup> Israel said as follows: <italic>who shall go before us</italic> (Ex. 32:l).<sup><xref rid="fn5691">150</xref></sup> If you pay attention to Israel&#x2019;s first journey<sup><xref rid="fn5692">151</xref></sup> you will understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn5693">152</xref></sup></p>
<p>The calf was thus made for the glory of God.<sup><xref rid="fn5694">153</xref></sup> Hence Aaron built an altar before the calf and announced that they should offer sacrifices on the morrow for the glory of God.<sup><xref rid="fn5695">154</xref></sup> Israel did as Aaron commanded them. Aaron&#x2019;s answer was<sup><xref rid="fn5696">155</xref></sup> that the people gathered themselves upon him (Ex. 32:l).<sup><xref rid="fn5697">156</xref></sup> I have already noted that whenever the verb <italic>kahal</italic> (gathered) is followed by the word <italic>al</italic> (upon) it has a negative connotation.<sup><xref rid="fn5698">157</xref></sup> However, if it is followed by the word <italic>el</italic> (to), as in <italic>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves</italic> (va-yikkhal) <italic>unto</italic> (el) <italic>king Solomon</italic> (I Kings 8:2), then it has a positive connotation. This is the meaning of <italic>thou knowest the people, that they are set on evil</italic> (Ex. 32:22). The meaning of the verse is: I did not do evil to them. For they merely asked for a being that would go before them.<sup><xref rid="fn5699">158</xref></sup> I made the calf for the glory of God.<sup><xref rid="fn5700">159</xref></sup> However, [the calf became an object of worship] because there was a mixed multitude among Israel. This what Aaron meant by <italic>ve-ra hu</italic> (they are set on evil).<sup><xref rid="fn5701">160</xref></sup> Aaron did not say <italic>ra hu</italic> (they are evil). A small group of Israelites thought that the calf was an idol. They brought sacrifices and bowed to the calf and said, <italic>This is thy god, O Israel</italic> (Ex. 32:4).</p>
<p>Do not be amazed that Scripture states, <italic>for thy people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5702">161</xref></sup>&#x2026;<italic>have dealt corruptly; they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them</italic> (Ex. 32:7,8), for Scripture does not say all thy people.<sup><xref rid="fn5703">162</xref></sup> Can you not see that Achan alone violated the ban<sup><xref rid="fn5704">163</xref></sup> and yet Scripture states, <italic>Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed My covenant&#x2026;and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have even put it among their own stuff</italic> (Josh. 7:11). Now, only three thousand Israelites,<sup><xref rid="fn5705">164</xref></sup> which comes to a half of a tenth of a tenth of the Israelite camp,<sup><xref rid="fn5706">165</xref></sup> worshipped the golden calf as a god,<sup><xref rid="fn5707">166</xref></sup> that is, said, <italic>This is thy god, O Israel</italic> (Ex. 32:4), or thought so in their hearts. The sum of the matter is that we would not be acting properly if we maintain that the calf was made to serve as an idol as the simple-minded believe.</p>
<p>Do not be surprised that God was furious with Aaron, because he was<sup><xref rid="fn5708">167</xref></sup> the cause of their sin. For look, Aaron was punished along with his brother Moses concerning the incident at the waters of Meribah.<sup><xref rid="fn5709">168</xref></sup> However, Moses and Aaron did not deliberately sin.<sup><xref rid="fn5710">169</xref></sup> Nevertheless, Scripture states regarding them, <italic>Because ye believed not in Me</italic> (Num. 20:12); <italic>ye rebelled</italic> (Num. 27:14), and <italic>ye trespassed against Me</italic> (Deut. 33:51).</p>

<ftnote id="fn5549"><sup>8</sup> The word <italic>karati</italic> (I have called) is to be connected to <italic>bezalel ben uri</italic> (Bezalel the son of Uri) rather than to the word <italic>be-shem</italic> (by name). Thus <italic>karati be-shem bezalel ben uri</italic> (I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri) is to be rendered: I have called Bezalel the son of Uri by name. I.E. comments thus because <italic>karati be-shem bezalel ben uri</italic> could conceivably be translated: I have called upon the name of Bezalel the son of Uri. Compare, <italic>va-yikra be-shem Adonai</italic> (and called upon the name of the Lord) (Gen. 12:8).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5553"><sup>12</sup> Caleb the son of Jephunneh was 39 years of age at the time that Bezalel constructed the tabernacle. For Caleb said, <italic>Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land</italic> (Josh. 14:7). Now the tabernacle was constructed in the first year of the Exodus, and the spies were sent in the second year of the Exodus. Caleb was thus 39 years of age when Bezalel constructed the tabernacle. I.E. reasons that it is highly unlikely for a 39-year-old man to be a great-grandfather. In fact, the only way the sages of the Talmud could explain the aforementioned was to maintain that the early generations had children at the age of eight.

<ftnote id="fn5663"><sup>122</sup> The verse continues, <italic>Whom Thou didst prove at Massah, With whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah</italic>. I.E. believes that the verse refers to Aaron. He interprets the first part of the verse as meaning, Aaron is fit to wear the Thummim and Urim because of his piety. He interprets the second part of the verse as meaning that the only stain on Aaron&#x2019;s piety was the incident at the waters of Meribah. See I.E. on Deut. 33:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5664"><sup>123</sup> In Deut. 33:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5665"><sup>124</sup> For the incident at the waters of Meribah, see Num. 20:1-12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5666"><sup>125</sup> Deut. 33:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5667"><sup>126</sup> If Aaron was tricked, he would have been shocked upon seeing the calf. He would not have commanded that an altar be built before the calf and burnt offerings be offered upon it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5668"><sup>127</sup> That is, the congregation that gathered against Aaron and demanded that he make a god for them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5669"><sup>128</sup> Moses appointed Aaron in his place till he returned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5670"><sup>129</sup> Not only did Moses not kill the individual called Aaron, he prayed on his behalf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5671"><sup>130</sup> The opinion that Aaron made the calf because he was afraid that Israel would kill him if he refused and that God in return would destroy Israel is also wrong. For it is not fitting that a pious man make an idol for others so that they do not die. Ibn Ezra here rejects the earlier quoted opinion that Aaron made the calf because he was afraid that God would destroy Israel if they killed Aaron. It should be noted that I.E. occasionally leaves out the first part of a clause. He expects the reader to fill it in.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5672"><sup>131</sup> This interpretation maintains that <italic>a feast</italic> (chag) <italic>to the Lord</italic> refers to the slaughter of the worshippers of the golden calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5673"><sup>132</sup> Translated according to I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5674"><sup>133</sup> One should not maintain that while most people understood <italic>Tomorrow shall be a feast</italic> (chag) <italic>to the Lord</italic> to mean they would offer sacrifices on the next day, Aaron&#x2019;s private meaning was: Tomorrow worshippers of the golden calf will be slaughtered.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5675"><sup>134</sup> He cannot claim that his intention was not to curse God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5676"><sup>135</sup> He is killed for what he said. He cannot claim that he didn&#x2019;t mean what he said.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5677"><sup>136</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 27:13 (Vol. 1, p. 262) and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5678"><sup>137</sup> Nebuchadnezzar had a dream which signified that he would live as a beast for seven years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5679"><sup>138</sup> According to the Talmud what Daniel meant was: God (<italic>My lord</italic>), the dream be upon Nebuchadnezzar (<italic>the dream be to them that hate thee</italic>). See <italic>Shavuot</italic> 35b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5680"><sup>139</sup> According to I.E. the term <italic>my lord</italic> does not refer to God but to Nebuchadnezzar, for Daniel was addressing the king, and the rules of etiquette required that he say, <italic>My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee</italic>. Hence one cannot take his words out of context and interpret it the way the Talmud does.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5681"><sup>140</sup> King Jehu proclaimed a festival for Baal. His intention was not to serve Baal but to trick the worshippers of Baal to come to Baal&#x2019;s temple, where Jehu would kill them. See II Kings 10:18-28. Aaron similarly wanted to identify those Israelites who wanted to worship the calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5682"><sup>141</sup> Hence Aaron built the altar before the golden calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5683"><sup>142</sup> If Aaron intended to trap the idol worshippers he would not have said, <italic>Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord</italic> (YHVH), for this is a call to worship <italic>YHVH</italic> and only <italic>YHVH</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5684"><sup>143</sup> Moses asked Aaron: <italic>What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?</italic> (Ex. 32:21).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5685"><sup>144</sup> Aaron&#x2019;s answer does not answer Moses&#x2019; question.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5686"><sup>145</sup> That is, the true meaning of the account of the making of the golden calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5687"><sup>146</sup> I.E. believes that Moses, rather than the pillar of fire, led Israel from the Red Sea to the wilderness of Sinai. See I.E. on Ex. 15:22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5688"><sup>147</sup> If Moses had told them that he would be on the mount for forty days, they would not have assumed that he died there.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5690"><sup>149</sup> In other words, Israel did not ask Aaron to make an idol. They requested that he make an image which had the power to lead them. Thus <italic>aseh lanu elohim</italic> (Ex. 32:1) does not mean: make us a god. It means: make us an image which will be inhabited by a heavenly power.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5691"><sup>150</sup> Israel said: <italic>Up, make us a god</italic> (elohim) <italic>who shall go before us</italic> (Ex. 32:1). We thus see that they sought an <italic>elohim</italic> who would lead them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5692"><sup>151</sup> Israel&#x2019;s first journey from Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5693"><sup>152</sup> Scripture tells us that when Israel left Egypt, <italic>the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire</italic> (Ex. 13:21). After Egypt drowned in the Red Sea, Moses led Israel. See note 158. Now that Moses was dead, Israel sought a substitute for Moses. See I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary: &#x201C;They only sought someone to go before them to find them a resting place.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5694"><sup>153</sup> God&#x2019;s spirit was to rest on the calf and lead them in the same way that it rested in the pillars of fire and cloud. See I.E. on Ex. 13:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5695"><sup>154</sup> His spirit would rest on the calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5696"><sup>155</sup> Aaron did not actually say this. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that Ex. 32:1 can be quoted in Aaron&#x2019;s defense.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5697"><sup>156</sup> The point is that Aaron did not make the calf on his own. The people gathered upon him and demanded that he make an <italic>elohim</italic> to lead them.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5706"><sup>165</sup> That is, one half of a percent, for 3,000 is half of a percent of 600,000. In other words, only one half of a percent of the Israelite camp actually worshipped the golden calf as a god.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 32</title>
<p>2. AND AARON SAID UNTO THEM: BREAK OFF THE GOLDEN RINGS. <italic>Pareku</italic> (break off) is vocalized like <italic>barekhu</italic> (bless). It is a <italic>pi&#x2019;el</italic>.</p>
<p>It was the custom of the Egyptians to place rings in their ears.<sup><xref rid="fn5716">1</xref></sup> It is similarly written with regard to the Midianites, <italic>because they were Ishmaelites</italic> (Jud. 8:24).<sup><xref rid="fn5717">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND ALL THE PEOPLE BROKE OFF THE GOLDEN RINGS WHICH WERE IN THEIR EARS. In the ears of the above-mentioned sons, daughters, and wives.<sup><xref rid="fn5718">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND HE RECEIVED IT AT THEIR HAND, AND FASHIONED IT WITH A GRAVING TOOL. The word <italic>va-yatzar</italic> (and fashioned it) is related to the word <italic>tzurah</italic> (form).<sup><xref rid="fn5719">4</xref></sup> It is like the word <italic>va-yatzar</italic> (fashioned) in <italic>Thus he fashioned the two pillars of brass</italic> (I Kings 7:15).</p>
<p>[WITH A GRAVING TOOL.] The word <italic>cheret</italic> (graving tool) means an image.<sup><xref rid="fn5720">5</xref></sup> <italic>Be-cheret enosh</italic> (in common script) (Is. 8:1) similarly means in the form of a person.<sup><xref rid="fn5721">6</xref></sup> There is no reason to connect <italic>cheret</italic> to the word <italic>ha-charitim</italic> (the veils) (Is. 3:22).<sup><xref rid="fn5722">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A MOLTEN CALF. The word <italic>masekhah</italic> means molten. It is similar to the word <italic>nasakh</italic> (hath melted)<sup><xref rid="fn5723">8</xref></sup> in <italic>The image perchance, which the craftsman hath melted</italic> (Is. 40:19).</p>
<p>5. AND WHEN AARON SAW THIS. In his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn5724">9</xref></sup> The word saw here is similar to the word saw in <italic>Then I saw</italic> (Eccles. 2:13),<sup><xref rid="fn5725">10</xref></sup> and the word saw in <italic>Now Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt</italic> (Gen. 42:1).<sup><xref rid="fn5726">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND THEY ROSE UP EARLY ON THE MORROW. Following the day that the altar was built.<sup><xref rid="fn5727">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND THE LORD SAID. <italic>Stiffnecked</italic> means that they refuse to do as God commanded. They are like a person who runs along on his way and does not turn his head back to the one who calls him. This expression is employed with regard to the Israelites for the following reason. Scripture tells us that Israel served idols in Egypt. It reports that God sent prophets to them saying, &#x201C;Let every man cast away the idols of Egypt.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn5728">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses related this incident<sup><xref rid="fn5729">14</xref></sup> to their children<sup><xref rid="fn5730">15</xref></sup> before he died.<sup><xref rid="fn5731">16</xref></sup> Moses employed different terminology. However, the import of the words is the same as here. Scripture here states that God told Moses, <italic>Go, get thee down; for thy people&#x2026;have dealt corruptly</italic> (v. 7). However, Moses later quoted God as saying, <italic>Arise, get thee down</italic> (Deut. 19:12). Scripture there<sup><xref rid="fn5732">17</xref></sup> writes, <italic>This is thy god, O Israel</italic> (v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn5733">18</xref></sup> Scripture goes on to say here, <italic>Now therefore let Me alone</italic> (ve-attah ha-nichah li) (v. 10). However, it later reads, <italic>let Me alone</italic> (heref mi-menni) (Deut. 9:14). Scripture here reads, <italic>that My wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them</italic> (v. 10). However, it later reads, <italic>that I may destroy them and blot out their name</italic> (Deut. 9:14). Scripture here reads, <italic>and I will make of thee a great nation</italic> (v. 10). However, Moses later quoted God as saying, <italic>and I will make of thee a nation mightier</italic> [<italic>and greater than they</italic>] (Deut. 9:14). The meanings are the same.</p>
<p>[10. NOW THEREFORE LET ME ALONE, THAT MY WRATH MAY WAX HOT AGAINST THEM, AND THAT I MAY CONSUME THEM.] God hinted to Moses that were He not concerned with Moses&#x2019; glory, He would destroy Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn5734">19</xref></sup> Hence Moses was compelled to pray.<sup><xref rid="fn5735">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND MOSES BESOUGHT. We encounter verbs from the root <italic>chet, lamed, heh</italic> that have this meaning<sup><xref rid="fn5736">21</xref></sup> only with regard to the face. Compare, <italic>Many will entreat</italic> (yechallu) <italic>the favour of the liberal man</italic> (Prov. 19:6). I believe that it is similar to <italic>and her face was no more</italic> (I Sam. 1:18).<sup><xref rid="fn5737">22</xref></sup> They are all similar.<sup><xref rid="fn5738">23</xref></sup> It is therefore incorrect to say <italic>chillitikha</italic> or <italic>achallekha</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn5739">24</xref></sup> for <italic>chillitikha</italic> and <italic>achallekha</italic> are related to the word <italic>chillah</italic> (sick) in <italic>wherewith the Lord hath made it sick</italic> (Deut. 29:21).<sup><xref rid="fn5740">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some commentaries say that this prayer is the same prayer found in the Torah portion <italic>Ve-Hayah Ekev</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5741">26</xref></sup> This prayer should have been recorded following Moses&#x2019; return to the mountain (v. 31).<sup><xref rid="fn5742">27</xref></sup> Therefore <italic>the Lord repented of the evil</italic> (v. 14) after Moses prayed and fell upon his face for forty days (Deut. 10:10).<sup><xref rid="fn5743">28</xref></sup> If God repented first,<sup><xref rid="fn5744">29</xref></sup> what reason was there for Moses to say, <italic>peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin</italic> (v. 30)? The sequence of events was as follows: Moses descended, burned the calf, and killed its worshippers. He then returned to pray to God on behalf of Israel and on behalf of Aaron,<sup><xref rid="fn5745">30</xref></sup> who was the cause.<sup><xref rid="fn5746">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that the prayer <italic>O Lord God, destroy not Thy people</italic> (Deut. 9:26) is not the prayer which is mentioned here.<sup><xref rid="fn5747">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that the contents of both prayers are the same.<sup><xref rid="fn5748">33</xref></sup> I will later explain this point. For how could Moses beg God [not to destroy Israel] before he burned the calf, caused Israel to drink, and killed its worshippers?<sup><xref rid="fn5749">34</xref></sup> God only hinted to Moses<sup><xref rid="fn5750">35</xref></sup> that he should pray after he descended and removed the calf. Hence after Moses removed their sin<sup><xref rid="fn5751">36</xref></sup> Scripture reads, <italic>peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin</italic> (v. 30). We similarly read, <italic>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made</italic>, [<italic>and burnt it with fire</italic>] (Deut. 9:21).</p>
<p>It was only because God told Moses, <italic>Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may wax hot against them</italic> (v. 10) that Moses<sup><xref rid="fn5752">37</xref></sup> mentioned the prayer that he prayed<sup><xref rid="fn5753">38</xref></sup> when he fell down before the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn5754">39</xref></sup> Actually, this chapter<sup><xref rid="fn5755">40</xref></sup> should have been written after <italic>And Moses returned unto the Lord</italic> (v. 31). However, there is no chronological order in the Torah. Scripture was only concerned with connecting the statement <italic>Whosoever hath sinned against Me</italic>, [<italic>him will I blot out</italic>] (v. 33) with <italic>And now go, lead the people</italic> (v. 34).<sup><xref rid="fn5756">41</xref></sup> Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn5757">42</xref></sup> goes on to state, <italic>And the Lord smote the people</italic> (v. 35).</p>
<p>BESOUGHT. Look.<sup><xref rid="fn5758">43</xref></sup> Scripture writes, <italic>So I fell down before the Lord the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; because the Lord had said he would destroy you</italic> (Deut. 9:25). This is what <italic>let Me alone, that I may destroy them</italic> (Deut. 9:14) refers to.<sup><xref rid="fn5759">44</xref></sup> The mind cannot accept the idea that Moses prayed on behalf of Israel while an idol was among them.<sup><xref rid="fn5760">45</xref></sup> He first removed the idol.</p>
<p>Now, <italic>Lord, why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5761">46</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>O Lord God, destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance</italic> (Deut. 9:26). Scripture then goes on to say, <italic>that Thou didst bring out by Thy great power and by Thy outstretched arm</italic> (Deut. 9:29). This is parallel to <italic>that Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5762">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture writes, <italic>Remember Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</italic> (Deut. 9:27). This is parallel to <italic>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Thy servants, to whom Thou didst swear by Thine own self</italic> (v. 13). Its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn5763">48</xref></sup> is, remember the oath which you swore to them.<sup><xref rid="fn5764">49</xref></sup> Scripture does not mention the oath in the verse that reads, <italic>Remember Thy servants</italic> (Deut. 9:27). For there is a difference in meaning between <italic>zekhor la&#x2019;avadekha</italic> (remember Thy servants) (Deut. 9:27) and <italic>zekhor adatekha</italic> (remember Thy congregation) in <italic>Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast gotten of old</italic> (Ps. 74:2), because of the <italic>lamed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5765">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, <italic>lest the land whence Thou broughtest us out say</italic> (Deut. 9:28) is parallel to <italic>Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying</italic> (v. 12).</p>
<p>12. [FOR EVIL DID HE BRING THEM FORTH.] The meaning of <italic>be-ra&#x2019;a hotzi&#x2019;am</italic> (for evil did He bring them forth) is, as our ancients hint,<sup><xref rid="fn5766">51</xref></sup> that they went out of Egypt under a star called <italic>ra</italic> (evil).<sup><xref rid="fn5767">52</xref></sup> Now Egypt will say that God does not have the ability to overcome the power of this star and save those who cleave to him. Hence when He saw that He was unable to overcome the star, He killed them.<sup><xref rid="fn5768">53</xref></sup> This will desecrate God&#x2019;s name.</p>
<p>Now<sup><xref rid="fn5769">54</xref></sup> Moses fell before God forty days.<sup><xref rid="fn5770">55</xref></sup> God then told him, <italic>for I will not go up in the midst of thee</italic> (Ex. 33:3). They will thus not inherit the land.<sup><xref rid="fn5771">56</xref></sup> Moses then said everything contained in the portion that opens with the words, See, <italic>Thou sayest unto me</italic> (Ex. 33:12).<sup><xref rid="fn5772">57</xref></sup> God then commanded him to descend, hew out tablets, and carry them in his hands up to the mountain.<sup><xref rid="fn5773">58</xref></sup> God then descended in a cloud<sup><xref rid="fn5774">59</xref></sup> and <italic>the skin of Moses&#x2019; face sent forth beams</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5775">60</xref></sup> God then wrote the second tablets.<sup><xref rid="fn5776">61</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads, <italic>At that time the Lord said unto me: Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first&#x2026;and make thee an ark of wood</italic> (Deut. 10:1). Israel was thus told to make the ark. This is the ark that Bezalel made.<sup><xref rid="fn5777">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. AND THE LORD REPENTED. Heaven forbid for the Lord to repent.<sup><xref rid="fn5778">63</xref></sup> Rather, Scripture employed human terminology. Compare, <italic>And God went up</italic> (Gen. 35:13);<sup><xref rid="fn5779">64</xref></sup> <italic>And the Lord came down</italic> (Gen. 11:5);<sup><xref rid="fn5780">65</xref></sup> <italic>Let the Lord rejoice in His works</italic> (Ps. 105:31), and, <italic>And it grieved Him at His heart</italic> (Gen. 6:6).<sup><xref rid="fn5781">66</xref></sup> Look, Samuel said, <italic>And also the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent</italic> (I Sam. 15:29). Nevertheless, Scripture there reads, <italic>It repenteth Me</italic> (I Sam. 15:11).<sup><xref rid="fn5782">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are those who explain<sup><xref rid="fn5783">68</xref></sup> <italic>va-yinachem</italic> (repented) by the Arabic word <italic>wa&#x2019;ad</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5784">69</xref></sup> However, there is no need for this.</p>
<p>15. AND MOSES TURNED. Scripture here tells us,<sup><xref rid="fn5785">70</xref></sup> <italic>and the mount burned with fire</italic> (Deut. 9:15).</p>
<p>The meaning of <italic>and Moses turned</italic> is that Moses looked around like a person who looks around and contemplates his course of action<sup><xref rid="fn5786">71</xref></sup>. Moses saw that he had to descend quickly. <italic>Va-yifen</italic> (turned) here is similar to <italic>va-yifen koh va-kho</italic> (and he looked this way and that way) (Ex. 2:12).</p>
<p>[IN HIS HAND.] In his possession.<sup><xref rid="fn5787">72</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>And take with thee ten men</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5788">73</xref></sup> For we cannot understand how Moses was able to bring down one tablet in his hand. It is next to impossible to believe that he carried down two tablets in his hand.<sup><xref rid="fn5789">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>[TABLES THAT WERE WRITTEN ON BOTH THEIR SIDES.] Now since Scripture explicitly tells us that the tablets were written on both sides, they could not have been made out of any of the stones that are mentioned with regard to the breastplate,<sup><xref rid="fn5790">75</xref></sup> for what was seen on one side would then be seen on the other side. The word <italic>ketuvim</italic> (written) does not mean seen.<sup><xref rid="fn5791">76</xref></sup> <italic>Ketuvim</italic> means written. Scripture tells us that what was written on one side was also written on the other side.<sup><xref rid="fn5792">77</xref></sup> Each tablet was thus thick.</p>
<p>There is no need to assume that the <italic>mem</italic> and the <italic>samekh</italic> which were inscribed in the tablets were miraculously suspended,<sup><xref rid="fn5793">78</xref></sup> for there is a difference of opinion regarding the meaning of the term <italic>ashurit</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5794">79</xref></sup> Some believe that the word <italic>ashurit</italic> means a praise-worthy script.<sup><xref rid="fn5795">80</xref></sup> Others maintain that it refers to the script which they brought up from Assyria.<sup><xref rid="fn5796">81</xref></sup> Furthermore, if the letters were visible on the reverse side, then the letters would appear backwards.<sup><xref rid="fn5797">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no room for one to argue with me and ask whether these stones were precious.<sup><xref rid="fn5798">83</xref></sup> The answer is that the stones were very precious because the writing of God was engraved upon them. The stones had to be thick. Where would Moses find very precious stones that were a cubit in length, a cubit and a half in width,<sup><xref rid="fn5799">84</xref></sup> and a cubit in height? Furthermore, where would Moses get the raw material to hew out two tablets of precious stones of the same dimensions as the first stones?</p>
<p>Now we do not know the way the Ten Statements were written on the two tablets without Moses having to turn them over.<sup><xref rid="fn5800">85</xref></sup> Hence after telling us <italic>that were written on both their sides</italic>, Scripture goes on to say, <italic>on the one side and on the other side were they written</italic>.</p>
<p>We have no way of knowing whether each one of the tablets was completely covered with writing, or whether some blank spaces were left on the four corners as we do today with our books. We similarly do not know whether the writing was thick or thin. There is no reason for us to speculate concerning things for which we do not have a tradition.</p>
<p>16. AND THE TABLES WERE THE WORK OF GOD. Our ancients said that it was decreed<sup><xref rid="fn5801">86</xref></sup> that they be like this.<sup><xref rid="fn5802">87</xref></sup> I have already explained this at the beginning of the Book of <italic>Bereshit</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5803">88</xref></sup> However, I believe that the meaning of <italic>the work of God</italic> is that they were created in their proper dimensions.<sup><xref rid="fn5804">89</xref></sup> This is mentioned because of the second tablets, which Moses hewed out.<sup><xref rid="fn5805">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>[GRAVEN.] Some say that the word <italic>charut</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5806">91</xref></sup> means <italic>charush</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5807">92</xref></sup> (graven).<sup><xref rid="fn5808">93</xref></sup> Others invert the letters<sup><xref rid="fn5809">94</xref></sup> and come up with the word <italic>chatar</italic> (dig) (Ezek. 8:8).<sup><xref rid="fn5810">95</xref></sup> Actually, the word has no counterpart [is a <italic>hapax legomenon</italic>]. It is possibly similar in meaning to the word <italic>patu&#x2019;ach</italic> (engraved).<sup><xref rid="fn5811">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. AND WHEN JOSHUA HEARD. And when Joshua, who remained at the foot of the mountain, heard.</p>
<p>AS THEY SHOUTED. The word <italic>be-re&#x2019;o</italic> (as they shouted) is related to the word <italic>tru&#x2019;ah</italic> (shouting).<sup><xref rid="fn5812">97</xref></sup> As the word <italic>de&#x2019;iy</italic> (my knowledge) in <italic>I will fetch my knowledge from afar</italic> (Job. 36:3) is derived from <italic>yada</italic>, so is the word <italic>yara</italic> derived from <italic>re&#x2019;o</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5813">98</xref></sup> The same applies to <italic>lamah tri&#x2019;iy re&#x2019;a</italic> (why dost thou cry out aloud) (Micah 4:9).<sup><xref rid="fn5814">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. AND HE SAID. Saadiah Gaon says that Joshua also said this.<sup><xref rid="fn5815">100</xref></sup> However, I believe that these are the words of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn5816">101</xref></sup> <italic>And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp</italic> which follows (v. 19) is proof of this.</p>
<p>BEING OVERCOME. The word <italic>chalushah</italic> (overcome) is a noun. It is similar to the word <italic>gevurah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5817">102</xref></sup> (mastery).</p>
<p>THE NOISE OF THEM THAT SING. <italic>Anot</italic> (that sing) means tunes. This is what <italic>and rose up to make merry</italic> refers to (v. 6).</p>
<p>THAT HE SAW THE CALF AND THE DANCING. The <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5818">103</xref></sup> prefixed to the word <italic>egel</italic> (calf) also refers to the word <italic>u-mecholot</italic> (and the dancing). The verse should be understood as follows: that he saw the calf and the dancing around it.</p>
<p>Moses was overcome by great jealousy.<sup><xref rid="fn5819">104</xref></sup> He therefore broke the tablets which were in his hands and served, as it were, as a document of witness<sup><xref rid="fn5820">105</xref></sup> Moses thus<sup><xref rid="fn5821">106</xref></sup> tore up the contract.<sup><xref rid="fn5822">107</xref></sup> As Scripture states, he did this in the sight of all of Israel.</p>
<p>20. AND HE TOOK THE CALF. Some say that the meaning of <italic>and burnt it with fire</italic> is that he melted it in fire.<sup><xref rid="fn5823">108</xref></sup> However, there is no need for this, for there is a substance<sup><xref rid="fn5824">109</xref></sup> which, when put into the fire along with the gold, causes the gold to immediately catch fire, turn black, and never again turn back into gold. This has been tested and found to be true.</p>
<p>AND STREWED IT UPON THE WATER. The reference is to the water from the brook that descended out of the mountain.<sup><xref rid="fn5825">110</xref></sup> Moses commanded all of Israel to drink from these waters. This was similar to <italic>and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water</italic> (Num. 5:17).<sup><xref rid="fn5826">111</xref></sup> Now the water caused a sign to appear on the face of those who served the calf or their bellies swelled up. For otherwise, how could the Levites know who worshipped the golden calf? We have already said that very few of the Israelites had evil thoughts.<sup><xref rid="fn5827">112</xref></sup> The intention of all<sup><xref rid="fn5828">113</xref></sup> was to do good.</p>
<p>21. AND MOSES SAID. Observe. Moses asked why Aaron needed to make the calf.<sup><xref rid="fn5829">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND AARON SAID: LET NOT THE ANGER OF MY LORD WAX HOT. Aaron called Moses my lord because of Moses&#x2019; great station.</p>
<p>[THAT THEY ARE SET ON EVIL.] I have already explained the meaning of <italic>that they are set on evil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5830">115</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>So they said unto me</italic> (v. 23)<sup><xref rid="fn5831">116</xref></sup> and, <italic>And I said unto them</italic> (v. 24).<sup><xref rid="fn5832">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND WHEN MOSES SAW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE BROKEN LOOSE. The word <italic>paru&#x2019;a</italic> (broken loose) is similar to <italic>yippare&#x2019;a</italic> (cast off restraint) in <italic>Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint</italic> (Prov. 28:18), and <italic>va-tifre&#x2019;u</italic> (ye have set at nought) in <italic>But ye have set at nought all my counsel</italic> (Prov. 1:25).</p>
<p>[FOR A DERISION.] Scripture employs an adjective (<italic>le-shimtzah</italic>) in place of an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn5833">118</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>le-shimtzah</italic> (for a derision) is that they will be a derision, a blemish, a defamation.<sup><xref rid="fn5834">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>AMONG THEIR ENEMIES. <italic>Kamehem</italic> (their enemies)<sup><xref rid="fn5835">120</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>kamim alai</italic> (rise up against me)<sup><xref rid="fn5836">121</xref></sup> in <italic>Many are they that rise up against me</italic> (Ps. 3:2) and the abridged form <italic>kamai</italic> (rise up against me)<sup><xref rid="fn5837">122</xref></sup> in <italic>that rise up against me</italic> (Ps. 18:49). However, the Aramaic translation connects <italic>kamehem</italic> to the word <italic>kamtem</italic> (ye are risen) in <italic>And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers&#x2019; stead</italic> (Num. 32:14).<sup><xref rid="fn5838">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. THEN MOSES STOOD. It is the practice of all camps that stay in one place for about a year<sup><xref rid="fn5839">124</xref></sup> to erect booths and have gates.<sup><xref rid="fn5840">125</xref></sup> In such a case, there is no need to set aside a place outside the camp as a latrine.<sup><xref rid="fn5841">126</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHOSO IS ON THE LORD&#x2019;S SIDE. Shall draw close to me; shall come near to me; shall come to me or shall gather to me.<sup><xref rid="fn5842">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE SONS OF LEVI. Who were of Moses&#x2019; family.</p>
<p>27. AND HE SAID UNTO THEM. Moses referred to the Lord as the God of Israel because those who worshipped the calf thought that the Lord was to be identified with the calf.<sup><xref rid="fn5843">128</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SLAY EVERY MAN HIS BROTHER. Even if it be his brother.<sup><xref rid="fn5844">129</xref></sup> Many interpret <italic>Who said of his father, and of his mother: I have not seen him</italic> (Deut. 33:9) as referring to this incident.<sup><xref rid="fn5845">130</xref></sup> They had to explain <italic>his father and his mother</italic> as referring to the father of the mother.<sup><xref rid="fn5846">131</xref></sup> However, as I will explain, there is no need for this interpretation.</p>
<p>28. AND THE SONS OF LEVI DID. Not all the sons of Levi.<sup><xref rid="fn5847">132</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND MOSES SAID. Its meaning is, and Moses already said to them.<sup><xref rid="fn5848">133</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>Then the Lord God formed</italic> (Gen. 2:7).<sup><xref rid="fn5849">134</xref></sup> There are many other such examples.<sup><xref rid="fn5850">135</xref></sup></p>
<p>[CONSECRATE.] The word <italic>milu</italic> (consecrate), which is in the <italic>kal</italic>, is grammatically irregular. It is sometimes transitive and at other times intransitive.<sup><xref rid="fn5851">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FOR EVERY MAN HATH BEEN AGAINST HIS SON.] Even if the worshipper be his son or brother he must kill him. They will be rewarded with a blessing for doing this. This is what <italic>At that time</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5852">137</xref></sup> <italic>the Lord separated the tribe of Levi</italic> (Deut. 10:8) refers to. Its meaning is that God told Moses at Mount Sinai the reason the tribe of Levi was set aside. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the Lord spoke with Moses in mount Sinai</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5853">138</xref></sup> (Num. 3:1).</p>
<p>Now Aaron, his sons, and the Levites were separated<sup><xref rid="fn5854">139</xref></sup> to serve the Lord at the time that the tabernacle was erected. Korah&#x2019;s quarrel<sup><xref rid="fn5855">140</xref></sup> took place at that time. Korah was a first-born.<sup><xref rid="fn5856">141</xref></sup> Korah rebelled when God set aside the Levites in place of the first-born who were holy.<sup><xref rid="fn5857">142</xref></sup> God did this because the first-born<sup><xref rid="fn5858">143</xref></sup> brought the burnt offerings before the calf and they slaughtered peace offerings upon the altar, which was made before the calf.</p>
<p>30. AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE MORROW. Following his descent.<sup><xref rid="fn5859">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND NOW I WILL GO UP. To return to the mountain to fall before the Lord and atone for Israel as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn5860">145</xref></sup> Perhaps God will write another pair of tablets in order to make a covenant with Israel. This is the meaning of <italic>Behold, I make a covenant</italic> (Ex. 34:10).<sup><xref rid="fn5861">146</xref></sup> For the tablets were, as it were, a document of witness.</p>
<p>31. AND MOSES RETURNED. The Nagid<sup><xref rid="fn5862">147</xref></sup> says that a <italic>lamed</italic> has been dropped and compensated for<sup><xref rid="fn5863">148</xref></sup> in the word <italic>anna</italic> (oh), which is short for <italic>al na</italic> (please consent). He maintains that the word <italic>al</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5864">149</xref></sup> is related to the word <italic>ho&#x2019;il</italic> (consent).<sup><xref rid="fn5865">150</xref></sup> However, this is far-fetched. On the contrary, its meaning is: please (<italic>anna</italic>) don&#x2019;t do this.<sup><xref rid="fn5866">151</xref></sup> <italic>Anna</italic> is an expression of appeasement,<sup><xref rid="fn5867">152</xref></sup> or confession, as here.<sup><xref rid="fn5868">153</xref></sup> <italic>Anna</italic> (I beseech Thee) in <italic>I beseech Thee, O Lord, for I am Thy servant</italic> (Ps. 116:16) is similar.</p>
<p>32. YET NOW&#x2026;BLOT ME, I PRAY THEE, OUT OF THY BOOK. I have already explained in my comments on <italic>And the books were opened</italic>, in the Book of Daniel (7:10), that all the decrees regarding masses and individuals are contingent upon the arrangements in the sky.<sup><xref rid="fn5869">154</xref></sup> Our sages have already admitted that children, longevity, and prosperity [depend upon the influence of the stars].<sup><xref rid="fn5870">155</xref></sup> However, God, as I have explained, increases the good which the heavenly arrangements have decreed because of a person&#x2019;s fear of the Lord.</p>
<p>33. AND THE LORD SAID. Saadiah Gaon says that this is what <italic>And the Lord repented</italic> (v. 14) refers to, for God had said that He would destroy all.<sup><xref rid="fn5871">156</xref></sup> The meaning of our verse is: Look. I will blot out of My book only those who sinned against Me in their minds.<sup><xref rid="fn5872">157</xref></sup> The aforementioned is to be understood after the manner of <italic>that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart</italic> (Ezek. 14:5).<sup><xref rid="fn5873">158</xref></sup> They were not killed<sup><xref rid="fn5874">159</xref></sup> because they did not actually worship the calf. This is the meaning of: And the Lord smote the people, because the calf was made and doubt<sup><xref rid="fn5875">160</xref></sup> came to people privately.<sup><xref rid="fn5876">161</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. AND NOW GO, LEAD THE PEOPLE UNTO THE PLACE OF WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN UNTO THEE. That is, <italic>unto the place of the Canaanite</italic> (Ex. 3:8). This was said in anger.<sup><xref rid="fn5877">162</xref></sup> God told Moses, I have forgiven their sin because of you. Now you, who love them so much, go lead them.</p>
<p>IN THE DAY. The beginning of every year is the day of accounting.<sup><xref rid="fn5878">163</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. AND THE LORD SMOTE. It is possible that there was no plague in the first year.<sup><xref rid="fn5879">164</xref></sup> The Torah merely reports what happened after they journeyed from Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn5880">165</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn5716"><sup>1</sup> The Israelites imitated the Egyptian custom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5717"><sup>2</sup> Jud. 8:24 reads, <italic>For they</italic> (the Midianites, so I.E) <italic>had golden earrings because they were Ishmaelites</italic>. I.E. believes that the Ishmaelites followed the same practices as the Egyptians because the Ishmaelites are descended from Hagar the Egyptian.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5718"><sup>3</sup> The sons, daughters, and wives mentioned in verse 2. In other words, <italic>And all the people</italic> does not include adult males. According to Sarim, I.E. comments thus because he held that the men did not wear rings in their ears.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5719"><sup>4</sup> Contrary to one of the interpretations offered by Rashi which connects <italic>va-yatzar</italic> with the word <italic>tzarar</italic> (to bind).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5720"><sup>5</sup> According to I.E. <italic>va-yatzar oto ba-cheret</italic> (and fashioned it with a graving tool) means, and he fashioned it into an image.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5721"><sup>6</sup> See I.E. on Is. 8:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5722"><sup>7</sup> Contra one interpretation of Rashi. Rashi comments: <italic>&#x201C;Ba-cheret</italic> means a piece of cloth, as in <italic>and the cloaks and the veils</italic> (ha-charitim).&#x201D; According to Rashi <italic>va-yatzar oto ba-cheret</italic> means, and he tied it [the gold] in a piece of cloth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5723"><sup>8</sup> It comes from the same root.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5724"><sup>9</sup> In others words, <italic>and when Aaron saw this</italic> means, and when Aaron considered the situation. I.E. comments thus because Scripture should have read and when Aaron heard this (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5725"><sup>10</sup> Eccles. 2:13 reads: <italic>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly</italic>. This obviously means: then I realized [saw in my heart] that wisdom excelleth folly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5726"><sup>11</sup> Jacob was then in Canaan. He obviously couldn&#x2019;t see the corn in Egypt. What the verse thus means is: And Jacob perceived that there was corn in Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5727"><sup>12</sup> In other words, <italic>mi-mochorat</italic> (the morrow) is short for <italic>mi-mochorat ha-yom she-nivneh ha-mizbe&#x2019;ach</italic> (on the morrow following the day the altar was built).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5728"><sup>13</sup> Ezek. 20:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5729"><sup>14</sup> The account of the golden calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5730"><sup>15</sup> To the next generation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5731"><sup>16</sup> In other words, the account of the making of the golden calf is recapitulated in the Book of Deuteronomy. See Deut. 9:7-29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5732"><sup>17</sup> Weiser suggests this is an error for &#x201C;here.&#x201D; However, it is possible that since the last quote is from Deuteronomy, I.E. refers to Exodus as &#x201C;there,&#x201D; even though he is now commenting on Exodus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5733"><sup>18</sup> There is no parallel to this clause in Deuteronomy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5734"><sup>19</sup> Therefore <italic>let Me alone</italic> implies that Moses is preventing God from destroying Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5735"><sup>20</sup> Once God informed Moses that he could hold back God&#x2019;s wrath, Moses felt compelled to do so and thus save Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5736"><sup>21</sup> Of besought or assuaged.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5737"><sup>22</sup> Translated literally. According to I.E., &#x201C;And her face was no more&#x201D; means, and her anger was no more. Similarly, <italic>va-chal moshe et pene Adonai</italic> (and Moses besought the face of God) means: and Moses assuaged the anger of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5738"><sup>23</sup> When the root <italic>chet, lamed, heh</italic> is connected to face.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5739"><sup>24</sup> If one wants to say I besought thee, or I will beseech thee.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5740"><sup>25</sup> Thus <italic>chillitikha</italic> means I made you sick, and <italic>achallekha</italic> means, I will make you sick. This form has the meaning of besought or assuaged only when connected to the word face.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5741"><sup>26</sup> Deut. 9:26-29. However, in Deuteronomy this prayer follows Moses&#x2019; return to the mountain. Here Moses offers it before he comes down from the mountain. Hence what follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5742"><sup>27</sup> In other words, Moses offered this prayer after returning to the mountain, as is recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5743"><sup>28</sup> This verse closes the account of Moses&#x2019; prayer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5744"><sup>29</sup> Before Moses came down from the mountain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5745"><sup>30</sup> Deut. 9:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5746"><sup>31</sup> As he actually made the calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5747"><sup>32</sup> In other words, the prayer recorded in Deut. 9:26-29 is not to be identified with the one recorded in Ex. 32:11-14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5748"><sup>33</sup> Hence, though their wordings differ, they are one and the same prayer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5749"><sup>34</sup> Hence the prayer recorded in Ex. 32:11-14 could not have been offered before Moses came down from the mount.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5750"><sup>35</sup> See I.E. on verse 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5751"><sup>36</sup> That is, after Moses burned the calf.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5756"><sup>41</sup> Which it couldn&#x2019;t do if Moses&#x2019; prayer was reproduced at this point. However, if the Torah was in chronological order Moses&#x2019; prayer would have been inserted between verse 32 and verse 33 (Meijler).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5757"><sup>42</sup> In keeping with verse 33.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5758"><sup>43</sup> I.E. now goes on to point out that the accounts of the golden calf as given in Deuteronomy and Exodus do not contradict each other. He similarly points out that the prayer offered by Moses here and in Deuteronomy are the same even though there is a difference in wording on some points.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5759"><sup>44</sup> I.E. has earlier explained that it was a hint to Moses that he should pray.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5760"><sup>45</sup> Hence, unlike Exodus, Deuteronomy does not report that Moses prayed at this point. I.E. earlier explained why Exodus does report the prayer at this point.

<ftnote id="fn5761"><sup>46</sup> Our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5762"><sup>47</sup> Our verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5763"><sup>48</sup> The meaning of <italic>Remember Thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</italic> (Deut. 9:27).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5765"><sup>50</sup> Prefaced to <italic>la-avadekha</italic> (Thy servants) in Deuteronomy 9:27. <italic>Zekhor la-avadekha</italic> means remember the oath. <italic>Zekhor avadekha</italic>, which is similar to <italic>zekhor adatekha</italic>, means Remember Thy servants. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that Deut. 9:27 is parallel to Ex. 32:13 even though the oath is not explicitly mentioned in Deut. 9:27.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5786"><sup>71</sup> In other words, <italic>va-yifen</italic> (turned) is to be taken metaphorically. Its meaning is, he contemplated his course of action (Sarim).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5787"><sup>72</sup> In other words, <italic>in his hand</italic> is to be interpreted as in his hands (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5788"><sup>73</sup> There is no such verse. The reference is probably to I Kings 14:3, <italic>And take with thee ten loaves</italic>. On the other hand, the reference might be to <italic>Take from hence thirty men with thee</italic> (Jer. 38:10).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5789"><sup>74</sup> It is I.E.&#x2019;s belief not to exaggerate the miracles recorded in Scripture. This stands in marked contrast to the rabbis of the Midrash, who tended to magnify the miracles recorded in Scripture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5790"><sup>75</sup> See Ex. 28:17-20. These stones were translucent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5791"><sup>76</sup> If it did, then it is possible to identify the stones from which the tablets were hewn with one of the stones on the breastplate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5792"><sup>77</sup> For Scripture reads, <italic>tables that were written on both their sides</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5793"><sup>78</sup> This is the opinion of Rabbi Chisda. See <italic>Megillah</italic> 2b and <italic>Sabbath</italic> 104a. Rabbi Chisda believed that the writing on the tablets was cut through the stone. Most letters of the alphabet are so shaped that it is possible to inscribe them in this manner. However, the final <italic>mem</italic> and <italic>samekh</italic> are round and cannot be so engraved. Hence Rabbi Chisda says that these letters stood on the tablets miraculously. I.E., as will soon be seen, disagrees with this interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5794"><sup>79</sup> The Hebrew square script is called <italic>ketav ashuri</italic>. There is a difference of opinion in the Talmud as to the origin of this term. See <italic>San.</italic> 22a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5795"><sup>80</sup> Hebrew, <italic>she-me&#x2019;usheret be-khetav</italic>. See <italic>San.</italic> 22a. According to this opinion the square script was the one in which the tablets were written. The Talmud, which maintains that the <italic>mem</italic> and the <italic>samekh</italic> were miraculously suspended on the tablets, accepts this opinion. So does I.E. in his comments on Ex. 1:9. Nevertheless, he argues that one does not have to assume that the <italic>mem</italic> and the <italic>samekh</italic> were miraculously suspended on the tablets, as he believes that the tablets were written on both sides and not chiseled through.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5796"><sup>81</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ashur</italic>. Hence the term <italic>ashurit</italic>. According to this opinion the Torah was given in <italic>ketav ivri</italic>, the ancient Hebrew script. In this script neither the <italic>samekh</italic> nor the <italic>mem</italic> is oval. According to this opinion there is no need to assume that the <italic>mem</italic> and the <italic>samekh</italic> were miraculously suspended on the tablets. I.E. quotes these two opinions in order to show that the rabbis themselves were divided as to whether the <italic>mem</italic> and the <italic>samekh</italic> were miraculously suspended on the tablets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5797"><sup>82</sup> They could thus be read on only one side. What point would there be then for the writing to be chiseled through?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5798"><sup>83</sup> According to an earlier opinion quoted by I.E. the tablets were made of precious stones. I.E. disagreed with this opinion. Now one can object to I.E.&#x2019;s rejection of this opinion on the ground that it is inconceivable that the divine tablets would be made of ordinary stone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5799"><sup>84</sup> For the dimensions of the tablets, see I.E.&#x2019;s comment on Ex. 25:10. I.E. there explains that the tablets were a cubed cubit. The words &#x201C;and a half&#x201D; thus appear to be an error. It was the ark that was a cubit and a half in width. Hence the error.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5800"><sup>85</sup> That is, <italic>tables that were written on both their sides</italic> implies that some of the Statements were written on one side of the tablet and others on the reverse side. Thus Moses had to turn them around to read them or show their complete comments to the people. Hence Scripture goes on to say, <italic>on the one side and on the other side were they written;</italic> i.e., what was written on one side was written on the other side.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5801"><sup>86</sup> On the eve of the Sabbath of creation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5802"><sup>87</sup> That is, that the tablets come into being. See <italic>Avot</italic> 5:6, &#x201C;Ten things were created on the eve of Sabbath at dusk&#x2026;the tablets.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5803"><sup>88</sup> According to I.E. on Genesis the word <italic>bara</italic> (created) means to cut or decree. Hence <italic>Avot</italic> 5:6 may be interpreted as meaning, on the eve of the Sabbath, God decreed that ten things come into being.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5804"><sup>89</sup> That is, that the tablets were now created by God (Meijler).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5805"><sup>90</sup> In other words, these tablets were the work of God but the second were shaped by Moses. So too Rashbam.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5806"><sup>91</sup> The word <italic>charut</italic> does not appear again in Scripture. Hence the difference of opinion concerning its meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5807"><sup>92</sup> In other words, the <italic>tav</italic> and <italic>shin</italic> interchange, as in the word <italic>pashar</italic> (explained) and <italic>patar</italic> (explained).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5808"><sup>93</sup> As in <italic>ma&#x2019;aseh charash even</italic> (the work of an engraver in stone) (Ex. 28:11).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5809"><sup>94</sup> <italic>Chet, resh, tav</italic>, the root of <italic>charut</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5810"><sup>95</sup> They interpret <italic>charut</italic> as if written <italic>chatur</italic> (dug), i.e., engraved.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5811"><sup>96</sup> See <italic>petuche chotam</italic> (the engravings of a signet) (Ex. 28:11).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5812"><sup>97</sup> The root of <italic>tru&#x2019;ah</italic> is <italic>resh, vav, ayin</italic>. The root of <italic>be-re&#x2019;o</italic> is <italic>yod, resh, ayin</italic>. However, both roots are related because the <italic>vav</italic> and <italic>yod</italic> interchange, as does their place in the stem (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5813"><sup>98</sup> This appears to be a scribal error, for it is not consistent with <italic>de&#x2019;iy</italic> (my knowledge) being derived from the root <italic>yod, dalet, ayin</italic>. Hence Weiser and Krinsky suggest emending to: so is the word <italic>re&#x2019;o</italic> derived from <italic>yara</italic>. See note 97.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5814"><sup>99</sup> Here too <italic>re&#x2019;a</italic> comes from the root <italic>yod, resh, ayin</italic>. However, <italic>tri&#x2019;iy</italic> like <italic>taru&#x2019;ah</italic> comes from <italic>resh, vav, ayin</italic>. However, both roots have one meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5815"><sup>100</sup> In other words, <italic>And he said</italic> refers to Joshua.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5836"><sup>121</sup> In other words, <italic>kamehem</italic> means those who arise against them, i.e., their enemies.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn5838"><sup>123</sup> Onkelos renders <italic>kamehem</italic> as their rising, i.e., the generations that rise up in their place. He explains <italic>le-shimtzah be-kamehem</italic> to mean, to give them a bad name throughout their coming generations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5839"><sup>124</sup> Israel camped at Sinai for a little less than a year. See Ex. 19:1 and Num. 10:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5840"><sup>125</sup> Hence the camp of Israel had a gate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5841"><sup>126</sup> As required by Deut. 23:13. If the camp had latrines outside its walls, it would make no sense for it to have a gate, for the gate would have to be open at all times so that people could use the latrine at all times. Hence I.E. points out that walled camps would have the latrine within their walls. See I.E. on Ex. 29:45.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5842"><sup>127</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>mi la-Adonai elai</italic>, which literally means whoso is on the Lord&#x2019;s side to me. Hence the various interpretations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5843"><sup>128</sup> The worshippers of the calf referred to it as the god of Israel (v. 4). Hence Moses emphasized that the Lord, not the calf, was the God of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5844"><sup>129</sup> If the worshipper happens to be his brother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5845"><sup>130</sup> See <italic>Yoma</italic> 66:2: <italic>&#x201C;Who said of his father, and of his mother: I have not seen him, his father</italic> refers to the father of his mother, who is an Israelite.&#x201D;</ftnote>

However, they didn&#x2019;t all participate in the slaying of the worshippers of the calf. Hence, unlike verse 26, which reads, <italic>And all the sons of Levi gathered</italic>, our verse reads, <italic>and the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses</italic>, omitting the word all.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5848"><sup>133</sup> Thug <italic>va-yomer</italic> is a pluperfect. Our verse literally reads, &#x201C;Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, every man against his son, and against his brother.&#x201D; Logic dictates that Moses said this to the Levites before they went out to slay the worshippers of the calf.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5849"><sup>134</sup> Which according to I.E. should be interpreted, and the Lord God had already formed. See I.E. on Gen. 2:7.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 33</title>
<p>1. AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES: DEPART, GO UP HENCE. Scripture reads <italic>go up</italic> because one who goes towards the left side<sup><xref rid="fn5881">1</xref></sup> goes up.<sup><xref rid="fn5882">2</xref></sup> Abraham therefore went down into Egypt (Gen. 12:10)<sup><xref rid="fn5883">3</xref></sup> because he was in the south.<sup><xref rid="fn5884">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>[JACOB.] I will do all of this<sup><xref rid="fn5885">5</xref></sup> because of the oath which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<p>2. AND I WILL SEND AN ANGEL BEFORE THEE. To help you.</p>
<p>[AN ANGEL.] Scripture does not read <italic>the</italic> angel<sup><xref rid="fn5886">6</xref></sup> because <italic>the</italic> angel<sup><xref rid="fn5887">7</xref></sup> refers to the angel which is known to have God&#x2019;s name in him.<sup><xref rid="fn5888">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. FOR I WILL NOT GO UP IN THE MIDST OF THEE. They will not erect the tabernacle,<sup><xref rid="fn5889">9</xref></sup> for I will not rest in the midst of Israel.</p>
<p>[LEST I CONSUME THEE IN THE WAY.] I will immediately consume them if they once again act in this manner.</p>
<p><italic>Akhelkha</italic> (I consume thee) is vocalized with a <italic>segol</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5890">10</xref></sup> in place of a <italic>pattach</italic>, and its <italic>lamed</italic> does not have a <italic>dagesh</italic> in it even though the rules of grammar require it.<sup><xref rid="fn5891">11</xref></sup> Compare the word <italic>achavvekha</italic> (I will tell thee)<sup><xref rid="fn5892">12</xref></sup> in <italic>I will tell thee, hear thou me</italic> (Job 15:17).<sup><xref rid="fn5893">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THESE EVIL TIDINGS. What evil tidings?<sup><xref rid="fn5894">14</xref></sup> The reference is to what is written afterwards, <italic>And the Lord said unto Moses</italic>, etc. (v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn5895">15</xref></sup> <italic>And the Lord said unto Moses</italic> (Ex. 4:19) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn5896">16</xref></sup> I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn5897">17</xref></sup> the meaning of <italic>Can He give bread also</italic> (Ps. 78:20).<sup><xref rid="fn5898">18</xref></sup> It<sup><xref rid="fn5899">19</xref></sup> is like <italic>And He commanded the skies above</italic> (Ps. 78:23),<sup><xref rid="fn5900">20</xref></sup> the meaning of which is, and He had already commanded the skies.<sup><xref rid="fn5901">21</xref></sup> This is also the case here.<sup><xref rid="fn5902">22</xref></sup> There is no need for the Geonic interpretation to the effect that they always did so.<sup><xref rid="fn5903">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL STRIPPED THEMSELVES OF THEIR ORNAMENTS. <italic>Et edyam</italic> means of their ornaments.<sup><xref rid="fn5904">24</xref></sup> The reference is to their fine garments and ornaments such as rings worn on the ears and fingers. The word <italic>edyam</italic> is to be interpreted in light of <italic>va-edekh edi</italic> (I decked thee also with ornaments) (Ezek. 16:11).<sup><xref rid="fn5905">25</xref></sup> Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments because they mourned over the incident of the calf.</p>
<p>7. NOW MOSES USED TO TAKE THE TENT. Scripture employs an imperfect<sup><xref rid="fn5906">26</xref></sup> in place of a perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn5907">27</xref></sup> We find the same in <italic>They made a calf in Horeb</italic> (Ps. 106:19).<sup><xref rid="fn5908">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE TENT. His tent.<sup><xref rid="fn5909">29</xref></sup> It is like <italic>and they came into the tent</italic> (Ex. 18:7).<sup><xref rid="fn5910">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>[NOW MOSES USED TO TAKE THE TENT AND PITCH IT WITHOUT THE CAMP, AFAR OFF FROM THE CAMP; AND HE CALLED IT THE TENT OF MEETING.] Look. Moses was separated from Israel because of the Glory that used to speak with him. This took place after he brought down the inscribed second tablets<sup><xref rid="fn5911">31</xref></sup> and Israel began to construct the tabernacle. Moses called his tent the tent of meeting because God met with him there until the tabernacle was erected. There is no chronological order in the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn5912">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some say that <italic>the tent</italic> refers to the tabernacle and that Scripture tells us where the tabernacle was located during the fifty days before the banners were set up.<sup><xref rid="fn5913">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND IT CAME TO PASS. This<sup><xref rid="fn5914">34</xref></sup> too was a sign.<sup><xref rid="fn5915">35</xref></sup> Israel saw that as soon as Moses came to the tent from the camp of the Israelites he immediately saw the pillar of cloud.</p>
<p>10. AND WHEN ALL THE PEOPLE SAW. This took place after what is reported in the section beginning with the words, <italic>See, Thou sayest unto me</italic> (v. 12), for what is recorded in the latter chapter occurred during the forty days that Moses fell before the Lord concerning the incident of the calf. After this, Moses descended and hewed out the stones. God then passed by Moses, and this led to the fulfillment of God&#x2019;s word, <italic>and thou shalt see My back</italic> (v. 23).<sup><xref rid="fn5916">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES FACE TO FACE. I will explain this in a section that will soon follow.<sup><xref rid="fn5917">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>BUT HIS MINISTER JOSHUA, THE SON OF NUN, A YOUNG MAN. Joshua lived a hundred and ten years.<sup><xref rid="fn5918">38</xref></sup> Our sages said that Joshua spent seven years conquering Canaan and seven years dividing it up.<sup><xref rid="fn5919">39</xref></sup> If this is the case, then Joshua was now fifty-six years old.<sup><xref rid="fn5920">40</xref></sup> Why then did Scripture call him a young man? This is its grammatical explanation. His minister Joshua, the son of Nun, performed the service of a young man.<sup><xref rid="fn5921">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD: SEE, THOU SAYEST UNTO ME. <italic>See</italic> means see the predicament in which I find myself.<sup><xref rid="fn5922">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will now grammatically explain the section.<sup><xref rid="fn5923">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>[I KNOW THEE.] Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that <italic>yedatikha</italic> (I know thee) means I have honored thee. However, this is incorrect, for <italic>that I may know Thee</italic> (v. 13) just as You know me follows.<sup><xref rid="fn5924">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. [MY PRESENCE.] Saadiah Gaon says that the meaning of the word <italic>panai</italic> (my presence)<sup><xref rid="fn5925">45</xref></sup> means my anger, as in <italic>u-fanehah lo hayu lah od</italic> (and her countenance was no more sad) (I Sam. 1:18).<sup><xref rid="fn5926">46</xref></sup> Now, what will the Gaon do with the word <italic>panekha</italic> (thy presence) in <italic>If Thy presence go not with me</italic> (v. 15)?<sup><xref rid="fn5927">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>I believe that <italic>panai</italic> means I, myself. It is similar to the word <italic>panekha</italic> (thine own person) in <italic>and that thou go to battle in thine own person</italic> (panekha) (II Sam. 17:11).</p>
<p>16. SO THAT WE ARE DISTINGUISHED. <italic>Ve-niflinu</italic> (so that we are distinguished) comes from the same root as <italic>ve-hiflah</italic> (shall make a division) in <italic>And the Lord shall make a division</italic> (Ex. 9:4). It belongs to those roots which end in a <italic>heh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5928">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. THY GLORY. Your very self, for Scripture explicitly states, <italic>And it shall come to pass, while My glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with My hand until I have passed by</italic> (v. 22).</p>
<p>[19. AND WILL PROCLAIM THE NAME OF THE LORD.] Scripture writes with regard to Abraham, <italic>and</italic> (he) <italic>called upon the name</italic> (be-shem) <italic>of the Lord</italic> (Gen. 12:8).<sup><xref rid="fn5929">49</xref></sup> People were the ones who were called upon to serve the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn5930">50</xref></sup> The word <italic>be-shem</italic> (upon the name) is therefore connected<sup><xref rid="fn5931">51</xref></sup> to God&#x2019;s glorious name. However, this is not the case with <italic>and proclaimed the name of the Lord</italic> (Ex. 34:5),<sup><xref rid="fn5932">52</xref></sup> for here the Lord is the one who calls.<sup><xref rid="fn5933">53</xref></sup> It is the same case with <italic>and will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5934">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. SEE ME. The word <italic>yirani</italic> (see me)<sup><xref rid="fn5935">55</xref></sup> is vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5936">56</xref></sup> It is vocalized like <italic>ro&#x2019;ani</italic> (seeth me)<sup><xref rid="fn5937">57</xref></sup> in <italic>And sayest</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5938">58</xref></sup> <italic>none seeth me</italic> (Is. 47:10), and <italic>le-hotzi&#x2019;anu</italic> (to bring us forth)<sup><xref rid="fn5939">59</xref></sup> in <italic>to bring us forth out of Egypt</italic> (Ex. 14:11), and <italic>yeshivani</italic> (bring me back)<sup><xref rid="fn5940">60</xref></sup> in <italic>If the Lord shall indeed bring me back to Jerusalem</italic> (II Sam. 15:8).</p>
<p>[AND LIVE.] The meaning of <italic>va-chai</italic> (and live) is, <italic>and will live</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5941">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>[FOR MAN SHALL NOT SEE ME AND LIVE.] For he will immediately die. Thus, upon seeing God&#x2019;s messenger, Manoah said, <italic>We shall surely die, because we have seen an angel</italic> (Jud. 13:22).<sup><xref rid="fn5942">62</xref></sup> Jacob similarly said, <italic>I have seen an angel face to face, and my life is preserved</italic> (Gen. 32:31).<sup><xref rid="fn5943">63</xref></sup> How much more is this true for one who beholds the Lord?</p>
<p>Some say <italic>for man shall not see Me</italic> [<italic>and live</italic>] means: only he who lives forever<sup><xref rid="fn5944">64</xref></sup> shall see Me.<sup><xref rid="fn5945">65</xref></sup> However, this is not in keeping with the text.<sup><xref rid="fn5946">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others say that the word <italic>lo</italic> (not) is also to be applied to the word <italic>va-chai</italic> (and live). Our text is to be read as if written, for neither man, nor he who lives, shall see Me.<sup><xref rid="fn5947">67</xref></sup> The reference is to the angels.<sup><xref rid="fn5948">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THOU SHALT STAND UPON THE ROCK. The reference is to the top of the mountain,<sup><xref rid="fn5949">69</xref></sup> for Scripture clearly states, <italic>and present thyself there to Me on the top of the mount</italic> (Ex. 34:2). God told Moses to stand there and God himself would place him in a cleft of the rock when the Lord&#x2019;s glory passed by (v. 22). For Scripture clearly states, <italic>that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock</italic> (v. 22). Scripture does not say that Moses should place himself in a cleft of the rock.</p>
<p>I will now explain the meaning of the portion.</p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that God told Moses:<sup><xref rid="fn5950">70</xref></sup> Bring up this people from this place wherein they sinned and I will forgive them<sup><xref rid="fn5951">71</xref></sup> in another place.<sup><xref rid="fn5952">72</xref></sup> Moses replied: If your anger is not removed from Israel in this place then carry us not up hence.<sup><xref rid="fn5953">73</xref></sup> However, the following appears to me to be the correct interpretation of the chapter. God told Moses, <italic>and I will send an angel before thee</italic> (v. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn5954">74</xref></sup> Moses then responded, <italic>and Thou hast not let me know whom Thou wilt send with me</italic> (v. 12), that is, whether this angel is the one concerning whom Scripture writes, <italic>for My name is in him</italic> (Ex. 23:21). God answered Moses, <italic>My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest</italic> (v. 14). The meaning of <italic>thee</italic> is: because I will go only with thee, but I will not rest in the midst of the children of Israel. Moses therefore responded, <italic>if Thy presence go not up with</italic> this nation, mentioned earlier by Moses in <italic>that this nation is Thy people</italic> (v. 13), [<italic>carry us not up hence</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn5955">75</xref></sup> Hence Moses employed the plural <italic>al ta&#x2019;alenu</italic> (carry us not up).<sup><xref rid="fn5956">76</xref></sup> <italic>For wherein now shall it be known that I have found grace in Thy sight&#x2026;is it not in that Thou goest with us</italic> (v. 16) is positive proof that this explanation<sup><xref rid="fn5957">77</xref></sup> is correct.</p>
<p>God then answered Moses, <italic>I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken, for thou hast found grace in My sight</italic> (v. 17). Moses was extremely happy to hear this and therefore said, <italic>let the Lord, I pray Thee, go in the midst of us</italic> (Ex. 34:9). The latter stands in marked contrast to <italic>for I will not go up in the midst of thee</italic> (v. 3).</p>
<p>Moses desired to see the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn5958">78</xref></sup> God answered him, <italic>for man shall not see Me and live</italic> (v. 20). This is the truth. For the senses only feel that which is transient. Therefore <italic>and they saw the God of Israel</italic> (Ex. 24:10), <italic>I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne</italic> (Is. 6:1), and the prophecies of Ezekiel<sup><xref rid="fn5959">79</xref></sup> were all visions of God.</p>
<p>Look, Scripture here states, <italic>and thou shalt see My back</italic>. It states elsewhere, <italic>and the similitude of the Lord doth he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn5960">80</xref></sup> <italic>behold</italic> (Num. 12:8). These things require a long explanation.</p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon says that face<sup><xref rid="fn5961">81</xref></sup> refers to the face of the light. Let the face of the sun serve as an example.<sup><xref rid="fn5962">82</xref></sup> The back<sup><xref rid="fn5963">83</xref></sup> refers to the remaining light that cleaves to a person.<sup><xref rid="fn5964">84</xref></sup> There is no need for all of this.<sup><xref rid="fn5965">85</xref></sup> However, before I explain this let me say the following: Know that God only spoke to Moses face to face from the third series of forty days<sup><xref rid="fn5966">86</xref></sup> onward. Moses&#x2019; face shone because God passed by his face. Moses&#x2019; prophecy at first was through the angel who appeared in the bush.<sup><xref rid="fn5967">87</xref></sup> Scripture there states, <italic>And the Lord said</italic> (Ex. 3:7).<sup><xref rid="fn5968">88</xref></sup> The same is true of <italic>And the Lord went before them</italic> (Ex. 13:21),<sup><xref rid="fn5969">89</xref></sup> for the messenger speaks in place of the one who sent him.<sup><xref rid="fn5970">90</xref></sup> The day that Moses saw what he requested was, to him, what the day of the giving of the Torah was to Israel. No human being who lived before or after Moses ever reached Moses&#x2019; status.</p>
<p>Our sages said that God showed Moses the knot of the <italic>tefillin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5971">91</xref></sup> There words are correct. However, its meaning is not in accordance with that of the wise men of this generation who interpret the Rabbinical statement literally. On the contrary, it has a deeply hidden secret meaning.</p>
<p>Abraham the author states: I have already explained that the name of God, which is written but not pronounced,<sup><xref rid="fn5972">92</xref></sup> is a proper name.<sup><xref rid="fn5973">93</xref></sup> This proper name refers to the Glory.<sup><xref rid="fn5974">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>If you add up all of the letters of God&#x2019;s proper name you get seventy-two.<sup><xref rid="fn5975">95</xref></sup> The sages therefore said that it is God&#x2019;s explicit name.<sup><xref rid="fn5976">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>If you add the square of one, the first number, to the square of five, the true middle number,<sup><xref rid="fn5977">97</xref></sup> you will get the numerical equivalent of God&#x2019;s name.<sup><xref rid="fn5978">98</xref></sup> This is also true regarding the five moving stars.<sup><xref rid="fn5979">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>When you add up the letters that one enunciates in naming half of the letters that make up God&#x2019;s name<sup><xref rid="fn5980">100</xref></sup> you will also get the numerical equivalent of God&#x2019;s name.<sup><xref rid="fn5981">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>When you add up the squares of the first four square numbers<sup><xref rid="fn5982">102</xref></sup> you get the numerical equivalent of half of God&#x2019;s name.<sup><xref rid="fn5983">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>When you multiply the first half of God&#x2019;s name<sup><xref rid="fn5984">104</xref></sup> by the second half of God&#x2019;s name<sup><xref rid="fn5985">105</xref></sup> you get the sum of the square of the odd numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn5986">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>When you subtract the square of the first letter of God&#x2019;s name<sup><xref rid="fn5987">107</xref></sup> from the sum of the squares of the first two letters<sup><xref rid="fn5988">108</xref></sup> of God&#x2019;s name, the remainder will be equivalent to the cube of the second letter of God&#x2019;s name.<sup><xref rid="fn5989">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>If you subtract the square of the first two letters of God&#x2019;s name<sup><xref rid="fn5990">110</xref></sup> from the square of the first three letters of God&#x2019;s name,<sup><xref rid="fn5991">111</xref></sup> the remainder<sup><xref rid="fn5992">112</xref></sup> will be equivalent to the cube of the third letter of God&#x2019;s name.<sup><xref rid="fn5993">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>This glorious God is similar to the number one which stands by itself and has no need for any number before it.<sup><xref rid="fn5994">114</xref></sup> If you consider the role that the number one plays in a sum of numbers, you will discover that one is the first of all the numbers in any sum, and that all sums consist of ones. God similarly is the One who is all.<sup><xref rid="fn5995">115</xref></sup> This is therefore the secret of the prayers and praises.<sup><xref rid="fn5996">116</xref></sup> It is the meaning of <italic>Thus will I magnify Myself, and sanctify Myself</italic> (Ezek. 38:23)<sup><xref rid="fn5997">117</xref></sup> and of <italic>in whom I will he glorified</italic> (Is. 49:3).<sup><xref rid="fn5998">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the One has no image. He encompasses all the images,<sup><xref rid="fn5999">119</xref></sup> for they all came from Him. Observe, the heavenly bodies, namely, the lights and the stars, have no front or back. This is certainly the case with man&#x2019;s heavenly soul. This is surely the case with those who serve on high.<sup><xref rid="fn6000">120</xref></sup> This is beyond the shadow of a doubt the case with the Most High.<sup><xref rid="fn6001">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now there is a vertical line between the two points.<sup><xref rid="fn6002">122</xref></sup> The point closest to the Creator<sup><xref rid="fn6003">123</xref></sup> is known as &#x201C;the prince of the face&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6004">124</xref></sup> and &#x201C;the prince of power.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6005">125</xref></sup> The point which lies on the opposite end of the line marks the end of power.<sup><xref rid="fn6006">126</xref></sup> Man moves frontward.<sup><xref rid="fn6007">127</xref></sup> The body which is on high moves towards the right.<sup><xref rid="fn6008">128</xref></sup> Plants grow upward.<sup><xref rid="fn6009">129</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Moses was able to know and perceive intellectually how human beings cleave to the Creator of the world<sup><xref rid="fn6010">130</xref></sup> who is called &#x201C;the back&#x201D; (v. 23). It is the nature of the Glory<sup><xref rid="fn6011">131</xref></sup> that no created being may have the power to know this.<sup><xref rid="fn6012">132</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>for man shall not see Me and live</italic> (Ex. 33:20). This is so because man&#x2019;s soul is in a body.<sup><xref rid="fn6013">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, after an intelligent person dies, his soul reaches a very high stage. It is a state which it could not reach while the individual was alive. Look, Moses<sup><xref rid="fn6014">134</xref></sup> became all-encompassing.<sup><xref rid="fn6015">135</xref></sup> God therefore told Moses, <italic>I know thee by name</italic> (v. 12),<sup><xref rid="fn6016">136</xref></sup> for only God knows the individuals and their parts in an all-encompassing manner.</p>
<p>Man is the most important being upon the earth. Hence the form of the cherubim.<sup><xref rid="fn6017">137</xref></sup> Israel is the most important type of human being.<sup><xref rid="fn6018">138</xref></sup> Hence the statement regarding the knot of the <italic>tefillin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6019">139</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>Shi&#x2019;ur Komah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6020">140</xref></sup> therefore<sup><xref rid="fn6021">141</xref></sup> writes that God created all corporeal beings and all beings more glorious than corporeal beings.<sup><xref rid="fn6022">142</xref></sup> The accidents<sup><xref rid="fn6023">143</xref></sup> are of less significance than the corporeal beings.<sup><xref rid="fn6024">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, Rabbi Ishmael says,<sup><xref rid="fn6025">145</xref></sup> &#x201C;Whoever knows the measure of the Creator of the world<sup><xref rid="fn6026">146</xref></sup> is assured of a place in the world to come. I and Rabbi Akiba vouch for this.&#x201D; This is the meaning of <italic>Let us make man in our image, after our likeness</italic> (Gen. 1:26).<sup><xref rid="fn6027">147</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note, all plants, all that live on the earth, all fowl, cattle, animal, creeping thing and all human beings<sup><xref rid="fn6028">148</xref></sup> are tied to the forty-eight forms of the sphere.<sup><xref rid="fn6029">149</xref></sup> This is the meaning of [<italic>and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven&#x2026;</italic>] <italic>which the Lord thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples under the whole heaven</italic> (Deut 4:19).<sup><xref rid="fn6030">150</xref></sup> Those who added &#x201C;to give light&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6031">151</xref></sup> did so to explain the verse. It is possible that they knew this<sup><xref rid="fn6032">152</xref></sup> but did not want to reveal this secret to the students. <italic>And that He had not allotted unto them</italic> (Deut. 29:25)<sup><xref rid="fn6033">153</xref></sup> is positive proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn6034">154</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is known that the seven moving stars<sup><xref rid="fn6035">155</xref></sup> have 120 possible conjunctions.<sup><xref rid="fn6036">156</xref></sup> The seven moving stars form the great conjunction in only one way.<sup><xref rid="fn6037">157</xref></sup> There are twenty-one two-star conjunctions.<sup><xref rid="fn6038">158</xref></sup> It is the same case with five-star conjunctions.<sup><xref rid="fn6039">159</xref></sup> This number results from seven.<sup><xref rid="fn6040">160</xref></sup></p>
<p>The stars can be in a three-star conjunction in thirty-five ways,<sup><xref rid="fn6041">161</xref></sup> for this number too is a result of the conjunctions of the seven moving stars.<sup><xref rid="fn6042">162</xref></sup> The same is true of a four-star conjunction.<sup><xref rid="fn6043">163</xref></sup> Now the stars can be in a six-star conjunction in seven ways.<sup><xref rid="fn6044">164</xref></sup></p>
<p>The influence of the conjunction which takes in all peoples of the earth<sup><xref rid="fn6045">165</xref></sup> varies in accordance with the constellation of every one<sup><xref rid="fn6046">166</xref></sup> of the seven sections<sup><xref rid="fn6047">167</xref></sup> which constitute the inhabited world.<sup><xref rid="fn6048">168</xref></sup> Scripture says concerning them, <italic>Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; Thou hast made summer and winter</italic> (Ps. 74:17), which differ in all of the areas.</p>
<p>Change does not come from the sun itself but because of its movement towards the north and south. Now the conjunction of the sun and moon in Aries<sup><xref rid="fn6049">169</xref></sup> occurs every 960 years. These two turn from the constellation with which they are in conjunction to the ninth constellation<sup><xref rid="fn6050">170</xref></sup> every twenty years. They make this cycle twelve times for a total of two hundred and forty years.<sup><xref rid="fn6051">171</xref></sup> From there<sup><xref rid="fn6052">172</xref></sup> they travel in the same manner and in an identical time period in the constellations of &#x201C;dust,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6053">173</xref></sup> the constellations of &#x201C;air,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6054">174</xref></sup> and the constellations of &#x201C;water.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6055">175</xref></sup></p>
<p>Do not think that the four elements are in heaven<sup><xref rid="fn6056">176</xref></sup> and that there is heat in the sun and coldness in the moon and Saturn.<sup><xref rid="fn6057">177</xref></sup> Heaven forbid.<sup><xref rid="fn6058">178</xref></sup> The creations that are high and above are glorious.<sup><xref rid="fn6059">179</xref></sup> Scripture says concerning them, <italic>For He commanded, and they were created</italic> (Ps. 148:5). <italic>He hath established them for ever and ever; He hath made a decree which shall not be transgressed</italic> (Ps. 148:6).<sup><xref rid="fn6060">180</xref></sup> They were created in this way<sup><xref rid="fn6061">181</xref></sup> only because of those whom they affect.<sup><xref rid="fn6062">182</xref></sup></p>
<p>The seven moving stars<sup><xref rid="fn6063">183</xref></sup> cannot change their nature. They cannot violate that which God has assigned to them. The same applies to the hosts of heaven. The inhabitants of the lower world are affected by them in accordance with their<sup><xref rid="fn6064">184</xref></sup> makeup. Hence they cannot benefit or harm. Thus they cannot help one who bows down to them, for what was decreed for him in accordance with the arrangements of the stars at the time of his birth shall befall him. He can only be saved from his fate if he cleaves to and is protected by a power that is higher and more powerful than the stars.</p>
<p>I will explain with a worthy parable. The arrangement of the stars had it that a river would overpower a city and kill or flood its inhabitants. A prophet came and warned the people to turn to God before the arrival of the day of their calamity. The people turned to God with all their heart. Because the people cleaved unto God, God put it into their hearts to go out of the city to pray unto the Lord. They did this. On the appointed day the river suddenly overflowed, as is its nature. We have witnessed this many times. The river flooded the entire city. Now God&#x2019;s decree was not altered and He saved them.</p>
<p>Imagine the following: The seven moving stars are like horses that run along a path. They do not run with the intention of doing good or bad. They act in accordance with their nature. Now imagine that a blind man is in their path. The blind man does not know how the horses act. He does not know when they go to the right and when they go to the left. The blind man depends on a person with sight who knows the way the horses run. Now the person with sight will guard the blind man. When the horses run to one side he will lead the blind person to the other side. The course of the horse&#x2019;s running does not change but the blind man is saved. It is because of this that Scripture states, [<italic>the sun, and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven&#x2026;</italic>] <italic>which the Lord thy God hath allotted</italic> [<italic>unto all the peoples under the whole heaven</italic>] (Deut. 4:19); <italic>But you hath the Lord taken&#x2026;to be unto Him a people of inheritance</italic> (Deut. 4:20). <italic>The portion of Jacob is not like these, For He is the former of all things</italic> (Jer. 51:19). This is the meaning of <italic>so that we are distinguished, I and Thy people</italic> (v. 16). This is what the rabbis mean by &#x201C;Israel has no constellation&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6065">185</xref></sup> as long as they keep the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn6066">186</xref></sup> If Israel does not keep the Torah, then the star rules over them, as has been proven, for any conjunction combined with Aquarius<sup><xref rid="fn6067">187</xref></sup> is an evil arrangement. It results in harm befalling Israel. This is admitted by the astrologers.</p>
<p>Now the stars were arranged in a conjunction which decreed that Israel should remain in exile in Egypt for many more years.<sup><xref rid="fn6068">188</xref></sup> God delivered them because they cried out unto the Lord and turned to Him (Ex. 2:23). What is true for the group<sup><xref rid="fn6069">189</xref></sup> is true for the individual.<sup><xref rid="fn6070">190</xref></sup> Therefore <italic>But he that keepeth the law, happy is he</italic> (Prov. 29:18). Observe, <italic>I know thee by name</italic> (v. 12) is similar to <italic>For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6071">191</xref></sup> (Ps. 1:6).<sup><xref rid="fn6072">192</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note, <italic>Show me, I pray Thee, Thy glory</italic> (v. 18) does not refer to seeing with the eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn6073">193</xref></sup> Observe. <italic>Al panekha</italic> (before thee) (v. 19)<sup><xref rid="fn6074">194</xref></sup> means: before thy inner face. It refers to the face of the heart.<sup><xref rid="fn6075">195</xref></sup> <italic>Kol tuvi</italic> (all my goodness) does not mean all. Neither does it mean in all or with all.<sup><xref rid="fn6076">196</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious</italic> (v. 19) refers to Moses, for Scripture tells us, <italic>I will make all My goodness pass before thee</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.). However, before I pass before thee I will show mercy to you;<sup><xref rid="fn6077">197</xref></sup> that is, I will cover you with My hand (v. 22). Look, this is its (v. 22) meaning. The hand served as a type of cover,<sup><xref rid="fn6078">198</xref></sup> as in the case of a person who uses his hand to ward off the light of the sun so that his soul does not separate from his body.</p>
<p>Observe. Scripture states, <italic>and thou shalt see My back</italic> (v. 23) because God is all, His glory fills all, from Him is all, and He encompasses all of their images.<sup><xref rid="fn6079">199</xref></sup> This is the meaning of <italic>and the similitude of the Lord doth he behold</italic> (Num. 12:8).</p>
<p>22. AND I WILL COVER THEE. <italic>Ve-sakkoti</italic> (and I will cover thee) has the same meaning whether spelled with a <italic>sin</italic> or a <italic>samekh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6080">200</xref></sup></p>

When one of them sees this light, he says: &#x201C;I have seen the glory of the Lord&#x2026;&#x201D; However, when they beheld this light, they were unable to look upon it because of its power and brilliance. Indeed, whoever looked upon it incurred the disintegration of his entire makeup and the flight of his spirit from his body.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Moses accordingly asked his Master to give him the strength to look upon this light. The latter, however, answered him that the first rays of this light were so powerful that he would be unable to view them clearly with his naked eyes, lest he perish. He would rather cover him up with a cloud or the like until the first rays of this light had passed, because the greatest strength of every radiant body is contained in its initial approach. All of this was implied in the statement of Scripture: <italic>And I&#x2026;will cover thee with My hand until I have passed by</italic>. Then when, the first portion of the light had passed, God removed from Moses the thing that had covered him, so that he might be able to look at the back of the light, as Scripture says: <italic>And I will take away My hand, and thou shalt see My back&#x201D;</italic> (Saadiah Gaon, <italic>The Book Of Beliefs And Opinion</italic>.

<p>[LIKE UNTO THE FIRST.] The same size as the first.</p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon says that the second tablets were more precious than the first, for the second tablets were given on a holy day, on the Day of Atonement. This was not the case with the first tablets. The first tablets descended<sup><xref rid="fn6088">2</xref></sup> on the seventeenth day of Tamuz,<sup><xref rid="fn6089">3</xref></sup> on a weekday. Furthermore, three covenants are mentioned with regard to the second tablets;<sup><xref rid="fn6090">4</xref></sup> <italic>and that it may go well with thee</italic> (Deut. 5:16) was inscribed on the second tablets;<sup><xref rid="fn6091">5</xref></sup> and the first tablets were broken. Now these things<sup><xref rid="fn6092">6</xref></sup> are similar to that which is seen in a dream.<sup><xref rid="fn6093">7</xref></sup> They neither help nor hinder.<sup><xref rid="fn6094">8</xref></sup> Both tablets had God&#x2019;s writing on them.<sup><xref rid="fn6095">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, the first tablets were the work of God whereas the second tablets were the work of Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn6096">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND BE READY BY THE MORNING, AND COME UP. This is the third time,<sup><xref rid="fn6097">11</xref></sup> and each time Moses stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.<sup><xref rid="fn6098">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND NO MAN SHALL COME UP WITH THEE. Scripture states, <italic>And no man shall come up with thee</italic>, because Aaron and his sons ascended and descended the mountain with Moses after God revealed himself to Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn6099">13</xref></sup> Aaron also ascended the mountain with Moses before God&#x2019;s revelation.<sup><xref rid="fn6100">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>THROUGHOUT ALL THE MOUNT. Even somewhere far removed from the place of God&#x2019;s glory.</p>
<p>4. AND HE HEWED TWO TABLES OF STONE&#x2026;AND TOOK IN HIS HAND TWO TABLES OF STONE. It is Hebrew style to speak thus and say, <italic>and took in his hand two tables of stone</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6101">15</xref></sup> The verse does not say, and took in his hand the two tables.<sup><xref rid="fn6102">16</xref></sup> Our verse is similar to <italic>Then the Lord caused to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord</italic> (Gen. 19:24).<sup><xref rid="fn6103">17</xref></sup> Scripture does not say, &#x201C;from Himself.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6104">18</xref></sup> We similarly find Scripture using the phrase the children of Israel five times in one verse.<sup><xref rid="fn6105">19</xref></sup> It is elegant to write thus.<sup><xref rid="fn6106">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THE LORD DESCENDED. Some say that <italic>and stood</italic> refers to the cloud,<sup><xref rid="fn6107">21</xref></sup> for God was passing by.<sup><xref rid="fn6108">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that the mountain symbolizes<sup><xref rid="fn6109">23</xref></sup> the celestial angels who are on a higher level than human beings, as the mountain is higher than the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn6110">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND PROCLAIMED THE NAME OF THE LORD. Note, it was the Lord who was proclaiming.<sup><xref rid="fn6111">25</xref></sup> God thus taught Moses how to proclaim<sup><xref rid="fn6112">26</xref></sup> the name of the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn6113">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND THE LORD PASSED BY. Do not be amazed that the Lord called out, &#x201C;the Lord,&#x201D; for God alone is the knower, the content of his thought, and the object of his thought.<sup><xref rid="fn6114">28</xref></sup> This is a very difficult concept.<sup><xref rid="fn6115">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Saadiah Gaon says that the first Lord<sup><xref rid="fn6116">30</xref></sup> is connected to <italic>and proclaimed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6117">31</xref></sup> Now if this is so, then why didn&#x2019;t the master of the cantillical notes<sup><xref rid="fn6118">32</xref></sup> connect them?<sup><xref rid="fn6119">33</xref></sup> Actually, Scripture repeats the Lord&#x2019;s name twice in our verse in the same manner that it repeats Abraham&#x2019;s name in <italic>Abraham</italic>, <italic>Abraham</italic> (Gen. 22:11); Jacob&#x2019;s name in <italic>Jacob</italic>, <italic>Jacob</italic> (Gen. 46:2); Moses&#x2019; name in <italic>Moses</italic>, <italic>Moses</italic> (Ex. 3:4).<sup><xref rid="fn6120">34</xref></sup> Our verse is to be similarly read.<sup><xref rid="fn6121">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is written<sup><xref rid="fn6122">36</xref></sup> that there are thirteen attributes.<sup><xref rid="fn6123">37</xref></sup> Saadiah Gaon said that the Lord&#x2019;s glorious name<sup><xref rid="fn6124">38</xref></sup> is included in the number. If so, then it is not an attribute.<sup><xref rid="fn6125">39</xref></sup> He also says that the second time the divine name<sup><xref rid="fn6126">40</xref></sup> is mentioned, it means Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn6127">41</xref></sup> However, this is an error, for our verse does not read &#x201C;Lord.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6128">42</xref></sup> The term Lord is an honorific substitute used by the reader.<sup><xref rid="fn6129">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Nissim says that the phrase long-suffering<sup><xref rid="fn6130">44</xref></sup> is really two attributes. God is long-suffering to the good and God is long-suffering to the bad. This too is incorrect, for an attribute is not to be added because of a change of persona.<sup><xref rid="fn6131">45</xref></sup> Furthermore, God is long-suffering to the wicked,<sup><xref rid="fn6132">46</xref></sup> not to the ones who have not sinned against Him.<sup><xref rid="fn6133">47</xref></sup> Observe. <italic>Ve-nakkeh</italic> (clear) is an attribute unto itself.<sup><xref rid="fn6134">48</xref></sup> The thirteen attributes end here.<sup><xref rid="fn6135">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the plain meaning of the text, <italic>ve-nakkeh lo yenakkeh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6136">50</xref></sup> (and that will by no means clear the guilty) (v. 7) is one attribute,<sup><xref rid="fn6137">51</xref></sup> for <italic>ve-nakkeh</italic> (clear) is an infinitive.<sup><xref rid="fn6138">52</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>anneh</italic> (afflict) in <italic>anneh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6139">53</xref></sup> <italic>te&#x2019;anneh oto</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6140">54</xref></sup> (if thou afflict them in any wise) (Ex. 22:22). <italic>Ve-nakkeh lo yenakkeh</italic> teaches that God will by no means clear the rebellious. God forgives only those who repent, as the prophets teach.<sup><xref rid="fn6141">55</xref></sup> The word <italic>ve-nakkeh</italic> was therefore counted as one of the thirteen attributes.<sup><xref rid="fn6142">56</xref></sup> The phrase <italic>poked avon avot</italic> (visiting the iniquity of the fathers) (v. 7) is also an attribute of mercy.<sup><xref rid="fn6143">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>Note that there are seven priestly garments.<sup><xref rid="fn6144">58</xref></sup> However, the plate<sup><xref rid="fn6145">59</xref></sup> was counted among the priestly garments<sup><xref rid="fn6146">60</xref></sup> because it is similar to an ornament. Look. Eleven tribes<sup><xref rid="fn6147">61</xref></sup> were born in Paddan-aram. Benjamin alone was born in the land of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn6148">62</xref></sup> However, Scripture writes concerning all of them, <italic>These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram</italic> (Gen. 35:26). It does so because Scripture speaks of the majority.<sup><xref rid="fn6149">63</xref></sup> It is not concerned with excluding the one exception.<sup><xref rid="fn6150">64</xref></sup> Scripture similarly states, <italic>Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons</italic> (Deut. 10:22). However, Manasseh and Ephraim<sup><xref rid="fn6151">65</xref></sup> did not descend to Egypt, for they were born there.<sup><xref rid="fn6152">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, they included the Lord&#x2019;s revered name among the attributes even though it is a proper name.<sup><xref rid="fn6153">67</xref></sup> I have already mentioned in the Torah portion <italic>Ve-Ellah Shemot</italic> that the name <italic>YHVH</italic> (Lord) is at times an adjective<sup><xref rid="fn6154">68</xref></sup> and at times an attribute.<sup><xref rid="fn6155">69</xref></sup> The Lord, the Lord (<italic>YHVH YHVH</italic>) are two attributes.</p>
<p>[GOD.] The word <italic>El</italic> (God) is the third attribute.</p>
<p>MERCIFUL. <italic>Rachum</italic> (merciful) is the fourth attribute.</p>
<p>AND GRACIOUS. <italic>Chanun</italic> (gracious) is the fifth attribute.</p>
<p>LONG-SUFFERING. <italic>Erekh appayim</italic> (long-suffering) is the sixth attribute.</p>
<p>AND ABUNDANT IN GOODNESS. <italic>Rav chesed</italic> (abundant in goodness) is the seventh attribute. The word <italic>rav</italic> (abundant) is also connected to the word <italic>emet</italic> (truth).<sup><xref rid="fn6156">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>TRUTH. <italic>Rav emet</italic> (abundant in truth) is the eighth attribute.</p>
<p>KEEPING MERCY UNTO THE THOUSANDTH GENERATION. <italic>Notzer chesed la-alafim</italic> (keeping mercy unto the thousandth generation) is the ninth attribute.</p>
<p>FORGIVING INIQUITY. <italic>Nose avon</italic> (forgiving iniquity) is the tenth attribute.</p>
<p>TRANSGRESSION. <italic>Nose pesha</italic> (forgiving transgression) is the eleventh attribute.<sup><xref rid="fn6157">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>SIN. <italic>Nose chatta&#x2019;ah</italic> (forgiving sin) is the twelfth attribute.</p>
<p>CLEAR. <italic>Ve-nakkeh</italic> (and clear) is the thirteenth attribute.</p>
<p>[THE LORD.]<sup><xref rid="fn6158">72</xref></sup> The name of the Lord, when an adjective, includes angels<sup><xref rid="fn6159">73</xref></sup> and humans, those above and those below.<sup><xref rid="fn6160">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>GOD. The term <italic>El</italic> (God) means powerful. He wisely does that which is proper.</p>
<p>MERCIFUL. As in <italic>Like as a father hath mercy</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6161">75</xref></sup> <italic>upon his children</italic> (Ps. 103:13). He watches over them so that they do not fall.</p>
<p>GRACIOUS. As in <italic>for I am gracious</italic> (Ex. 22:26), to save the one who falls and is unable to rise.<sup><xref rid="fn6162">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>LONG-SUFFERING. He does not become quickly angry at the wicked.</p>
<p>AND ABUNDANT IN GOODNESS. To the righteous and the wicked.</p>
<p>ABUNDANT IN TRUTH. He fulfills and keeps His word.</p>
<p>KEEPING MERCY. Keeping the mercy of a father<sup><xref rid="fn6163">77</xref></sup> to his children, provided that the children are righteous.</p>
<p>FORGIVING INIQUITY. Pay attention to what I am about to say.<sup><xref rid="fn6164">78</xref></sup> Look. Scripture writes, <italic>be thou strong therefore, and be to a man</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6165">79</xref></sup> (I Kings 2:2).<sup><xref rid="fn6166">80</xref></sup> But was he<sup><xref rid="fn6167">81</xref></sup> not a man? Its meaning<sup><xref rid="fn6168">82</xref></sup> can only be, be a famous man of valor. However, Scripture writes, <italic>for I</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6169">83</xref></sup> <italic>am too old to be to a man</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6170">84</xref></sup> (Ruth 1:12).<sup><xref rid="fn6171">85</xref></sup> Its meaning is, I am too old to be sexually approached by a man,<sup><xref rid="fn6172">86</xref></sup> or, I am too old to be a woman to a man, for the speaker<sup><xref rid="fn6173">87</xref></sup> was a female.<sup><xref rid="fn6174">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>Behold. <italic>That I</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6175">89</xref></sup><italic>may come</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6176">90</xref></sup> <italic>into her</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6177">91</xref></sup> (Gen 34:21)<sup><xref rid="fn6178">92</xref></sup> refers to sexual intercourse, for Rachel was a female.<sup><xref rid="fn6179">93</xref></sup> However, <italic>that came</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6180">94</xref></sup> <italic>in to thee this night</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6181">95</xref></sup> (Gen. 19:5) does not have the same meaning, for Lot was a man.<sup><xref rid="fn6182">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Scripture tells us that one who sins shall bear his iniquity (<italic>ve-nasa avono</italic>) (Lev. 5:1); that is, his sin shall not be forgiven except by the punishment which shall befall him. <italic>Ve-nasa</italic> (shall bear)<sup><xref rid="fn6183">97</xref></sup> has the same meaning as <italic>tissa</italic> (shalt bear it) in <italic>And if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it</italic> (Prov. 9:12). However, Pharaoh said, <italic>Now therefore forgive</italic> (sa),<sup><xref rid="fn6184">98</xref></sup> <italic>I pray thee, my sin only this once</italic> (Ex. 10:17), because Moses was a righteous person.<sup><xref rid="fn6185">99</xref></sup> The general rule is that Scripture is always expressing approbation when it tells us that someone bears his own sin.</p>
<p>The term <italic>nasa</italic> is used in two ways in reference to sin. One, God will forgive the sinner. In this case it is for the benefit of the one whose sin is forgiven.<sup><xref rid="fn6186">100</xref></sup> The second way in which this verb is used is to inform us that some evil person shall bear his sin.<sup><xref rid="fn6187">101</xref></sup> Now this term<sup><xref rid="fn6188">102</xref></sup> has a negative connotation for the one who must bear his sin, but it has a positive connotation for the one whose sin is forgiven, as in <italic>then he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6189">103</xref></sup> <italic>shall bear</italic> (ve-nasa) <italic>her iniquity</italic> (Num. 30:16), for the sin will be removed from her<sup><xref rid="fn6190">104</xref></sup> and be upon him.<sup><xref rid="fn6191">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>FORGIVING&#x2026;TRANSGRESSION. Note that <italic>pesha</italic> (transgression) is a more serious violation than <italic>avon</italic> (iniquity), for the transgressor removes himself, as it were, from the authority of God.<sup><xref rid="fn6192">106</xref></sup> Compare, <italic>tifsha</italic> (revolted)<sup><xref rid="fn6193">107</xref></sup> in <italic>then Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah</italic> (II Kings 8:22).<sup><xref rid="fn6194">108</xref></sup> Now <italic>avon</italic> (iniquity) is less of a violation than <italic>pesha</italic> (transgression). It<sup><xref rid="fn6195">109</xref></sup> refers to a deliberate violation of God&#x2019;s command.</p>
<p>[SIN.] The word <italic>chatta&#x2019;ah</italic> means sin.<sup><xref rid="fn6196">110</xref></sup> <italic>Chatta&#x2019;ah</italic> is a noun. It is not like the word <italic>chatta&#x2019;ah</italic> (sinful) in <italic>ha-mamlakha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6197">111</xref></sup> <italic>ha-chatta&#x2019;ah</italic> (the sinful kingdom) (Amos 9:8), for the word <italic>chatta&#x2019;ah</italic> in the latter is an adjective. The word <italic>chatta&#x2019;ah</italic> (sin) takes in all sins committed in thought<sup><xref rid="fn6198">112</xref></sup> and in error; <italic>avon</italic> relates to violations of the law committed verbally or in deed.</p>
<p>Now we looked at the prayer which Moses offered because of the incident of the spies.<sup><xref rid="fn6199">113</xref></sup> Moses pronounced the name of the Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn6200">114</xref></sup> The latter is a noun. The attributes which follow were stated with regard to this name.<sup><xref rid="fn6201">115</xref></sup> Moses did not mention the Lord&#x2019;s name a second time;<sup><xref rid="fn6202">116</xref></sup> that is, he did not mention the adjectival name of the Lord<sup><xref rid="fn6203">117</xref></sup> because the Lord wanted to destroy Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn6204">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses did not mention <italic>El</italic> (God)<sup><xref rid="fn6205">119</xref></sup> because there was no reason to mention this attribute.<sup><xref rid="fn6206">120</xref></sup> He also did not mention <italic>rachum</italic> (merciful)<sup><xref rid="fn6207">121</xref></sup> because the Israelites were not simpletons.<sup><xref rid="fn6208">122</xref></sup> Moses did not mention <italic>channun</italic> (gracious)<sup><xref rid="fn6209">123</xref></sup> because no one oppressed Israel and they had no need to cry to God for help.<sup><xref rid="fn6210">124</xref></sup> Moses mentioned <italic>erekh appayim</italic> (slow to anger)<sup><xref rid="fn6211">125</xref></sup> because they were wicked.</p>
<p>Moses noted<sup><xref rid="fn6212">126</xref></sup> that God is <italic>plenteous in lovingkindness</italic> (ve-rav emet). Its meaning is that God is <italic>plenteous in lovingkindness</italic> to all.<sup><xref rid="fn6213">127</xref></sup> Moses did not mention <italic>emet</italic> (truth)<sup><xref rid="fn6214">128</xref></sup> because they were guilty.<sup><xref rid="fn6215">129</xref></sup> Moses mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn6216">130</xref></sup> that God forgives <italic>avon</italic> (iniquity) and <italic>pesha</italic> (transgression). He omitted <italic>chatta&#x2019;ah</italic> (sin) because Israel did not err.<sup><xref rid="fn6217">131</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses<sup><xref rid="fn6218">132</xref></sup> included himself among the Israelites and said, <italic>and pardon our iniquity</italic> (avonenu) <italic>and our sin</italic> (chattatenu) (v. 9) because of his great humility. Moses did not add the phrase <italic>pesha&#x2019;enu</italic> (our transgression) because of his great saintliness, for Moses would not rebel.<sup><xref rid="fn6219">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND MOSES MADE HASTE. Those whose heads are empty say that when God said, <italic>and unto the fourth generation</italic> (v. 7) Moses hastened<sup><xref rid="fn6220">134</xref></sup> lest the Lord add, and unto the fifth generation. This is a great error. The mind rebels against the thought that Moses would interrupt the Lord while He was speaking, for if Moses acted in this manner he would have immediately incurred the death penalty. It was only after the voice ceased<sup><xref rid="fn6221">135</xref></sup> that Moses hastened to pray. Furthermore, the Decalogue reads the same.<sup><xref rid="fn6222">136</xref></sup> Now all of Israel heard this.<sup><xref rid="fn6223">137</xref></sup> How then could Moses even think that God would add, unto the fifth generation. There was no need to add &#x201C;of them that hate Me&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6224">138</xref></sup> because He mentions, <italic>and that will by no means clear the guilty</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6225">139</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND BOWED.] The word <italic>va-yikkod</italic> comes from a double root.<sup><xref rid="fn6226">140</xref></sup> It is related to the word <italic>kadkod</italic> (skull). Moses placed his skull on the ground. <italic>Va-yikkod</italic> follows the paradigm of <italic>va-yittom</italic> (spent)<sup><xref rid="fn6227">141</xref></sup> in <italic>and when the money was all spent</italic> (Gen. 47:15). Similarly <italic>va-yikkedu</italic> (then they bowed their heads) (Ex. 4:31) is similar to <italic>va-yittemu</italic> (were ended) (Deut. 34:8).<sup><xref rid="fn6228">142</xref></sup> Pay no heed to those who add roots because of a word&#x2019;s form.<sup><xref rid="fn6229">143</xref></sup> The word <italic>yiddemu</italic> (they are still) in <italic>they are as still as a stone</italic> (Ex. 15:16) should be understood in this manner.<sup><xref rid="fn6230">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND HE SAID. The meaning of <italic>let the Lord, I pray Thee, go in the midst of us</italic> is, when we journey,<sup><xref rid="fn6231">145</xref></sup> as in <italic>And I will walk among you</italic> (Lev. 26:12).<sup><xref rid="fn6232">146</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR IT IS A STIFF NECKED PEOPLE. According to Rabbi Merinus, <italic>ki am kesheh oref hu</italic> (for it is a stiffnecked people) should be rendered, even though it is a stiffnecked people.<sup><xref rid="fn6233">147</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>refa&#x2019;ah nafshi ki chatati lakh</italic> (heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee) (Ps. 41:5) should be rendered, heal my soul; even though I have sinned against Thee.<sup><xref rid="fn6234">148</xref></sup> However, I believe that the meaning of <italic>refa&#x2019;ah nafshi ki chatati lakh</italic> is, heal my soul because I confess<sup><xref rid="fn6235">149</xref></sup> that I have sinned against Thee and I have become ill because of my sins. The meaning of our verse similarly is: I confess that it is a stiff necked people but pardon<sup><xref rid="fn6236">150</xref></sup> [our iniquity and our sin].<sup><xref rid="fn6237">151</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND HE SAID: BEHOLD, I MAKE A COVENANT. This is what <italic>for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel</italic> (v. 27) refers to. The reference is to the conditions starting from <italic>Observe thou</italic> (v. 11). It is because of this<sup><xref rid="fn6238">152</xref></sup> that I will write a second pair of tablets. The latter shall serve as a document of witness. All of this, namely, that I have forgiven their sin, was because of your honor. I will therefore do marvels for you so that all who see you will marvel, and know that I have placed My glory upon you. The aforementioned is something that I have not wrought since the day that I created heaven and earth.<sup><xref rid="fn6239">153</xref></sup> The reference is to the shining of Moses&#x2019; face. Observe. Scripture writes that at the time of Moses&#x2019; death, unlike the nature of all old people, <italic>his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated</italic> (Deut. 34:7).</p>
<p>[SUCH AS HAVE NOT BEEN WROUGHT IN ALL THE EARTH, NOR IN ANY NATION.] Its meaning is, such a thing has been unheard of among the nations.</p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon explains it as follows: such a thing has not been wrought in the land of Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn6240">154</xref></sup> from which you exited, or among any of the other nations.</p>
<p>11. OBSERVE THOU. I believe that the Lord is addressing Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn6241">155</xref></sup> God is telling Moses to keep these things<sup><xref rid="fn6242">156</xref></sup> and to then relate them to the children of Israel. <italic>Shemor</italic> (observe) is to be taken in the sense of <italic>shameru</italic> (kept) in <italic>They</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6243">157</xref></sup><italic>kept His testimonies, and the statute that He gave them</italic> (Ps. 99:7), in accordance with the way I have explained it in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn6244">158</xref></sup></p>
<p>[BEHOLD, I AM DRIVING OUT BEFORE THEE.] Your opening words to Israel shall be,<sup><xref rid="fn6245">159</xref></sup> <italic>behold I am driving out before thee</italic>. <sup><xref rid="fn6246">160</xref></sup> This section<sup><xref rid="fn6247">161</xref></sup> is similar to <italic>Behold, I send an angel before thee</italic> (Ex. 23:20)<sup><xref rid="fn6248">162</xref></sup> and the section which precedes it (Ex. 23:12-19).<sup><xref rid="fn6249">163</xref></sup></p>
<p>[I AM DRIVING OUT.] The word <italic>goresh</italic> (I am driving out) is a transitive verb in the <italic>kal</italic>. It is the same case with the word <italic>gerushah</italic> (one divorced) in <italic>A widow, or one divorced</italic> (Lev. 21:14).</p>
<p>12. TAKE HEED TO THYSELF. This verse is similar to <italic>Thou shalt not bow down to their gods</italic> (Ex. 23:24).<sup><xref rid="fn6250">164</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. BUT YE SHALL BREAK DOWN THEIR ALTARS. This is similar to <italic>but thou shalt utterly overthrow them</italic> (<italic>Ibid</italic>.).<sup><xref rid="fn6251">165</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. [A JEALOUS GOD.] Scripture mentions a jealous God here as it does in the Decalogue.<sup><xref rid="fn6252">166</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. LEST THOU MAKE A COVENANT. This is similar to <italic>Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods</italic> (Ex. 23:32).<sup><xref rid="fn6253">167</xref></sup> Our verse adds, <italic>lest thou make a covenant&#x2026;and their daughters go astray</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6254">168</xref></sup> as an explanation.</p>
<p>17. [MOLTEN GODS.] The phrase &#x201C;the gods of the nations&#x201D; takes in all idol worship.<sup><xref rid="fn6255">169</xref></sup> The reason our verse reads molten gods is because of the golden calf.</p>
<p>18. [THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD.] Scripture mentions the feast of unleavened bread here as it does in an earlier chapter.<sup><xref rid="fn6256">170</xref></sup></p>
<p>Look. The feast of unleavened bread serves as a memorial, for Scripture states, <italic>for in it thou camest out from Egypt</italic> (Ex. 23:15). It is because of this that Scripture mentions the law dealing with the firstling of an ass (v. 20), which is also in memory of the Exodus from Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn6257">171</xref></sup> We similarly find Scripture mentioning laws pertaining to the harvest<sup><xref rid="fn6258">172</xref></sup> along with the harvest festival,<sup><xref rid="fn6259">173</xref></sup> namely, <italic>And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not reap the corner of thy field</italic>, etc. (Lev. 23:22). It similarly mentions the laws pertaining to the harvest in the Torah portion <italic>Kedoshim Teheyu</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6260">174</xref></sup> It is because Passover recalls the Exodus that Scripture mentions, <italic>All that openeth the womb is Mine</italic> (v. 19).<sup><xref rid="fn6261">175</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. [THY CATTLE.] The word <italic>miknekha</italic> (thy cattle) is a feminine here.<sup><xref rid="fn6262">176</xref></sup> There are many other nouns that are both masculine and feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn6263">177</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. SIX DAYS THOU SHALT WORK. Scripture earlier reads similarly.<sup><xref rid="fn6264">178</xref></sup></p>
<p>[IN PLOWING TIME AND IN HARVEST THOU SHALT REST.] Scripture states, <italic>in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest</italic> because human life is dependent principally on these activities.</p>
<p>Anan,<sup><xref rid="fn6265">179</xref></sup> may his name be erased like a cloud,<sup><xref rid="fn6266">180</xref></sup> says that the reference is to sexual relations.<sup><xref rid="fn6267">181</xref></sup> Will Anan not be covered with shame? We will grant that it is in the hand of man to plow (<italic>charish</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn6268">182</xref></sup> However, Anan is silent (<italic>yacharish</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn6269">183</xref></sup> with regard to the word harvest.<sup><xref rid="fn6270">184</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture does not mention the Sabbatical year in this section.<sup><xref rid="fn6271">185</xref></sup> What we ordinarily mean by a full day consists of the movement of the upper sphere<sup><xref rid="fn6272">186</xref></sup> from east to west in twenty-four hours. A day of the sun<sup><xref rid="fn6273">187</xref></sup> consists of three hundred and sixty-five days and about a quarter of a day, for this is how long it takes the sun to make a circuit from its point of departure in the west until it returns to its place.<sup><xref rid="fn6274">188</xref></sup> Those who know the science of the constellations will understand this.</p>
<p>22. AND THE FEAST OF INGATHERING. Scripture states this<sup><xref rid="fn6275">189</xref></sup> in two places.<sup><xref rid="fn6276">190</xref></sup> Scripture there reads, <italic>at the end of the year</italic> (Ex. 23:16) because the end of the year is the beginning of the next year.<sup><xref rid="fn6277">191</xref></sup> This is the proof.<sup><xref rid="fn6278">192</xref></sup> The sun enters the constellation of Libra<sup><xref rid="fn6279">193</xref></sup> close to the tenth day.<sup><xref rid="fn6280">194</xref></sup> The new year never occurs after the end of the festival of Sukkot. Scripture therefore reads, <italic>at the turn of the year</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6281">195</xref></sup> Do not rely on Samuel&#x2019;s circuits.<sup><xref rid="fn6282">196</xref></sup> Only rely on Rav Ada&#x2019;s circuit<sup><xref rid="fn6283">197</xref></sup> even though it requires two adjustments. One, because the sun at times travels in a longer circuit and at times it travels in a shorter circuit. This difference is not in the sun&#x2019;s movement, for the sun always travels in a consistent course. Its speed only appears to vary when viewed against a point in the sphere of the constellations.<sup><xref rid="fn6284">198</xref></sup> A second adjustment has to be made because of the movement of the epicycle at the head of Aries.<sup><xref rid="fn6285">199</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. THREE TIMES IN THE YEAR. Scripture mentions the God of Israel in this section<sup><xref rid="fn6286">200</xref></sup> because of the incident of the golden calf.<sup><xref rid="fn6287">201</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. FOR I WILL CAST OUT. Scripture explains in this chapter what it does not mention in the earlier one,<sup><xref rid="fn6288">202</xref></sup> for there was no need to mention it in the earlier chapter.<sup><xref rid="fn6289">203</xref></sup> Now since God commanded<sup><xref rid="fn6290">204</xref></sup> all male Israelites to see His face,<sup><xref rid="fn6291">205</xref></sup> and all of Israel is doing His will, the Lord will undoubtedly guard their land from their enemies. Scripture explains this point very clearly.<sup><xref rid="fn6292">206</xref></sup></p>
<p>[NEITHER SHALL ANY MAN COVET THY LAND.] I will make your neighbors so fearful that they will not even covet your land.<sup><xref rid="fn6293">207</xref></sup> They certainly will not think of waging war.</p>
<p>26. THE CHOICEST FIRST-FRUITS OF THY LAND. Scripture reads similarly in the earlier chapter.<sup><xref rid="fn6294">208</xref></sup></p>
<p>These are the conditions.<sup><xref rid="fn6295">209</xref></sup> From <italic>Now these are the ordinances</italic> (Ex. 21:1) until <italic>And six years</italic> (Ex. 23:10) consists of ordinances. The high priest and the judge, namely, the king, are obligated to study them and know them.<sup><xref rid="fn6296">210</xref></sup> The obligations of the congregation, which are the same as those noted here,<sup><xref rid="fn6297">211</xref></sup> are then mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn6298">212</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND THE LORD SAID. Even though these things were already written,<sup><xref rid="fn6299">213</xref></sup> Moses wrote them again with the Decalogue.<sup><xref rid="fn6300">214</xref></sup> This section was therefore written twice.</p>
<p>28. AND HE WAS THERE. Many think that Moses spent eighty days on the mountain until God gave him the tablets.<sup><xref rid="fn6301">215</xref></sup> They are mistaken. On the contrary, the words of our ancient sages<sup><xref rid="fn6302">216</xref></sup> are, as I have already noted, correct.<sup><xref rid="fn6303">217</xref></sup> Look, Moses spent forty days on the mountain until God gave him the first tablets. Scripture clearly states, <italic>and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights</italic> (Ex. 24:18).<sup><xref rid="fn6304">218</xref></sup> Moses himself similarly states, <italic>So I fell down before the Lord the forty days and forty nights</italic> (Deut. 9:25).<sup><xref rid="fn6305">219</xref></sup> Moses then<sup><xref rid="fn6306">220</xref></sup> said everything that is recorded in the section starting with the words <italic>See Thou sayest unto me</italic> (Ex. 33:12). Moses then descended and hewed the tablets and personally brought them up to Mount Sinai. Observe, Scripture states, <italic>And the Lord passed by before him</italic> (v. 6), and later goes on to say, <italic>And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water</italic>. As was his practice the first time, so was his practice the second time.<sup><xref rid="fn6307">221</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND HE WROTE UPON THE TABLES. God wrote upon the tablets,<sup><xref rid="fn6308">222</xref></sup> for Scripture explicitly states, <italic>and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou didst break</italic> (v. 1).</p>
<p>29. THAT MOSES KNEW NOT THAT THE SKIN OF HIS FACE SENT FORTH BEAMS WHILE HE TALKED WITH HIM. The meaning of <italic>while He talked with him</italic> is, while God talked with him. This occurred because the glory<sup><xref rid="fn6309">223</xref></sup> was seen upon Moses&#x2019; face. Moses&#x2019; face therefore shone like the brightness of the firmament.</p>
<p>[SENT FORTH BEAMS.] The word <italic>karan</italic> (sent forth beams) is related to the word <italic>karnayim</italic> (rays) in <italic>Rays hath He at His side</italic> (Hab. 3:4),<sup><xref rid="fn6310">224</xref></sup> for the opening part of the verse explicitly states, <italic>And a brightness appeareth as the light</italic>. Now since <italic>Rays hath He at His side</italic> follows,<sup><xref rid="fn6311">225</xref></sup> our verse repeats the same idea in different words<sup><xref rid="fn6312">226</xref></sup> as is the custom of Scripture.</p>
<p>May the bones of Chivi the transgressor<sup><xref rid="fn6313">227</xref></sup> be crushed, for Chivi said that Moses&#x2019; face turned dry as a horn<sup><xref rid="fn6314">228</xref></sup> because he did not eat bread. Chivi similarly explains, <italic>and they were afraid</italic> (v. 30) as meaning they were afraid because Moses&#x2019; face was ugly. Now why did this cursed wretch not open his eyes. A person will only fear to approach someone because there is something strange in him which he has never ever seen before.<sup><xref rid="fn6315">229</xref></sup> There is no person who has never looked upon the face of a corpse that does not fear to approach a dead body. Furthermore, if this is the case,<sup><xref rid="fn6316">230</xref></sup> why was the veil not always upon the face of Moses? Why did Moses always remove the veil (v. 33) when he spoke with Israel? Did Chivi not see that when Moses was one hundred and twenty years old (Deut. 34:7) <italic>his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated</italic>? This was most certainly so<sup><xref rid="fn6317">231</xref></sup> when Moses was eighty years old.<sup><xref rid="fn6318">232</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. AND WHEN AARON. Who was first in rank.</p>
<p>AND ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. The reference is to the leaders with whom it was the practice of Moses to speak. Scripture similarly states, <italic>And Moses called unto them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6319">233</xref></sup> (v. 31).</p>
<p>31. RETURNED UNTO HIM. This shows that they turned away from Moses after they went out to meet him because they were greatly frightened.</p>
<p>[32. AND AFTERWARD.] Afterward all the children of Israel who stood at the foot of the mount came near.</p>
<p>32. AND HE GAVE THEM IN COMMANDMENT. All of the conditions already mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn6320">234</xref></sup></p>

<p>Some say that the light was renewed upon Moses&#x2019; face every time Moses came to the tent of meeting and spoke with God. When Moses left the tent the light remained<sup><xref rid="fn6326">240</xref></sup> as long as he related God&#x2019;s words to the children of Israel. When Moses finished speaking he put on the veil, for he knew that the light would depart and his face would return to its prior state. It would be an insult to Moses if the Israelites saw his face without light radiating from it. Moses therefore put on the veil. However, when he came in to speak with God he would remove<sup><xref rid="fn6327">241</xref></sup> the veil to receive the light.</p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon says that the light was not removed from Moses&#x2019; face until the day of his death. Therefore Moses&#x2019; eye was not dimmed.<sup><xref rid="fn6328">242</xref></sup> This is correct. However, Saadiah says that Moses put on the veil so that the Israelites would not be afraid when they quarreled with each other.<sup><xref rid="fn6329">243</xref></sup> However, I believe that Moses put on a veil out of respect to the light which God newly created upon his face. He did not want Israel to constantly see it. He wanted them to see it only when he spoke God&#x2019;s words. He removed the veil when he came into the tent of meeting to speak with God face to face. This is the meaning of <italic>But when Moses went in</italic>, etc. (v. 34).</p>
<p>35. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SAW THE FACE OF MOSES, THAT THE SKIN OF MOSES&#x2019; FACE SENT FORTH BEAMS. Observe. The meaning of <italic>and Moses put the veil back upon his face</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6330">244</xref></sup> is that Moses always acted in this manner.<sup><xref rid="fn6331">245</xref></sup> This was his practice in dealing with the Israelites until the day that God&#x2019;s glory gathered him to Himself.

<ftnote id="fn6098"><sup>12</sup> Moses ascended the mountain after the revelation to receive the first set of tablets. He was then on the mountain for 40 days (Ex. 25:18). After Moses broke the tablets he spent 40 days in prayer on behalf of Israel (Deut. 10:11). Moses spent 40 days on the mountain when he received the second pair of tablets (v. 28). There are 120 days between the sixth of Sivan, when the revelation occurred, and the Day of Atonement, when Moses brought down the second pair of tablets. Hence Moses ascended the mountain three times between the sixth of Sivan and the tenth of Tishri.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6127"><sup>41</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>va-yikra, YHVH YHVH</italic>. Saadiah interprets this as, and <italic>YHVH</italic> proclaimed <italic>Adonai</italic> (Lord). According to Saadiah Gaon, YHVH YHVH (The Lord, the Lord) counts as two attributes.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6129"><sup>43</sup> Whenever a reader of Scripture comes across the divine name <italic>YHVH</italic>, he reads it as <italic>Adonai</italic> (Lord).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6133"><sup>47</sup> There is no reason for God to be long-suffering to the righteous. There is thus not even a change in persona.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6134"><sup>48</sup> The phrase reads, <italic>ve-nakkeh lo yenakkeh</italic> (and that will by no means clear the guilty), which literally means clear, He shall not clear. Now &#x201C;clear&#x201D; is an attribute of mercy. He shall not clear is not an attribute of mercy. Hence the rabbis separated the two. See next note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6135"><sup>49</sup> According to Saadiah Gaon and Rabbi Nissim. So Krinsky and Weiser. However, their interpretation is questionable because I.E. himself later notes that the 13 attributes end with <italic>ve-nakkeh</italic>. Hence this comment may be taken as a general statement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6136"><sup>50</sup> Literally, clear, He shall not clear.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6137"><sup>51</sup> One might take the phrase <italic>ve-nakkeh lo yenakkeh</italic> as referring to two attributes. See <italic>Yoma</italic> 86a, which interprets <italic>ve-nakkeh</italic> as referring to those who repent and <italic>lo yenakkeh</italic> to those who do not repent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6138"><sup>52</sup> Clear, He shall not clear, is another way of saying, He shall surely not clear, for when Scripture wants to emphasize a point it couples an infinitive with an imperfect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6139"><sup>53</sup> <italic>Anneh</italic> is an infinitive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6140"><sup>54</sup> Literally, afflict, thou shalt afflict him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6141"><sup>55</sup> The prophets teach that God forgives those who repent. Hence <italic>ve-nakkeh lo yenakkeh</italic> (and that will by no means clear the guilty) must apply only to those who do not repent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6142"><sup>56</sup> <italic>Ve-nakkeh</italic> is short for <italic>ve-nakkeh lo yenakkeh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6143"><sup>57</sup> I.E. apparently considers it a continuation of <italic>ve-nakkeh lo yenakkeh</italic>; i.e., God does not clear the wicked, but he visits their sins on their children if their children are evil. So Filwarg. Filwarg interprets thus because I.E. considers <italic>ve-nakkeh</italic> as the last of the 13 attributes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6144"><sup>58</sup> See Ex. 28:4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6145"><sup>59</sup> Hebrew, <italic>tzitz</italic>, the plate worn on the forehead of the high priest. See Ex. 28:36-38.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6146"><sup>60</sup> The rabbis speak of eight priestly garments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6147"><sup>61</sup> That is, ancestors of the tribes. The reference is to the 12 sons of Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6148"><sup>62</sup> Gen. 35:16-19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6149"><sup>63</sup> I.E. comments thus because he wants to prepare the reader for his next point, namely, that there are only 12 attributes.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6151"><sup>65</sup> Manasseh and Ephraim are listed among the 70 who descended to Egypt in Gen. 46:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6152"><sup>66</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 46:23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6153"><sup>67</sup> Thus when the rabbis speak of 13 attributes they speak of the majority of the attributes, for the first &#x201C;Lord&#x201D; is not an attribute. It is a proper name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6154"><sup>68</sup> But not an attribute (Weiser).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6155"><sup>69</sup> See I.E. on Ex. 3:15. <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 38 reads: &#x201C;The name <italic>YHVH</italic> is at times an adjective, that is, an attribute.&#x201D; This reading is superior to the ones in the printed texts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6156"><sup>70</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>ve-rav chesed ve-emet</italic> (and abundant in goodness and truth). According to I.E. this should be read as if written, and abundant in goodness, and abundant in truth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6157"><sup>71</sup> Our verse reads, <italic>nose avon va-fesha ve-chatta&#x2019;ah</italic> (forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin). I.E. believes that this should be interpreted as if written, forgiving iniquity, forgiving transgression, and forgiving sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6158"><sup>72</sup> After listing the 13 attributes I.E. goes on to explain them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6159"><sup>73</sup> Literally, the glorious ones.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6160"><sup>74</sup> This may be taken to mean that the meaning of Lord is: Lord over the spirits and the bodies, Lord of those above and those below. However, see I.E. on Gen. 1:16: God is one. He is the creator of all. He is all.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6161"><sup>75</sup> J.P.S. renders compassion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6162"><sup>76</sup> I.E. interprets <italic>chanun</italic> (gracious) to mean compassionate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6163"><sup>77</sup> Remembering the acts of kindness performed by the father. See Rashi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6164"><sup>78</sup> I.E. is going to point out that a word or a phrase may have more than one meaning. He does this because God is described in our verse as a <italic>nose avon</italic> (forgiving iniquity). However, Scripture often refers to sinners as being <italic>nose avon</italic> (bearing iniquity) (Lev. 5:1). I.E. thus points out that the same term may have two meanings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6165"><sup>79</sup> That is, be a man. Hebrew, <italic>ve-hayita le-ish</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6173"><sup>87</sup> Naomi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6174"><sup>88</sup> We thus see that the terms &#x201C;to be to a man&#x201D; (<italic>ve-hayita le-ish</italic>, or, <italic>mi-heyot le-ish</italic>) can mean, be a famous man or to be sexually approached by a man. We thus see that the same term can have two meanings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6175"><sup>89</sup> Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6176"><sup>90</sup> Hebrew, <italic>va-avo&#x2019;ah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6177"><sup>91</sup> Rachel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6178"><sup>92</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6179"><sup>93</sup> When Scripture uses the term &#x201C;coming&#x201D; with regard to a man coming to a woman, it means to have intercourse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6180"><sup>94</sup> Hebrew, <italic>ba&#x2019;u</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6181"><sup>95</sup> This was addressed to Lot by the men of Sodom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6182"><sup>96</sup> We thus see that the phrase &#x201C;come into&#x201D; may mean to enter a person&#x2019;s property or to have intercourse with.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6183"><sup>97</sup> In Lev. 5:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6184"><sup>98</sup> <italic>Sa</italic> and <italic>nasa</italic> come from the same root, <italic>nun, sin, alef</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6185"><sup>99</sup> And would not bear a grudge. The point is <italic>sa na chatati</italic> does not mean bear my sin. It means forgive my sin. We thus see that <italic>nasa</italic> means both to bear and to forgive.</ftnote>

However, <italic>let the Lord, I pray Thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiff necked people</italic> makes no sense. Hence Rabbi Marinus&#x2019; comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6234"><sup>148</sup> Rabbi Marinus believes that <italic>heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee</italic> makes no sense. Hence his comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6235"><sup>149</sup> In other words, <italic>ki</italic> (for) is to be interpreted, for I confess.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6237"><sup>151</sup> Our verse is to be interpreted, let the Lord, I pray Thee, go in the midst of us; for I confess that it is a stiff necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6240"><sup>154</sup> Saadiah understand <italic>ha-aretz</italic> (the earth) to mean the land. He interprets it as referring to the land of Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6241"><sup>155</sup> In other words, thou refers to Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6242"><sup>156</sup> Transmit the exact contents. I.E. explains <italic>They kept</italic> (shameru) <italic>His testimonies</italic> (Ps. 99:7) to mean Moses and Aaron transmitted the exact contents of God&#x2019;s testimonies. They did not add or diminish anything from God&#x2019;s dictum. See I.E. on Ps. 99:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6243"><sup>157</sup> Moses and Aaron. See I.E. on Ps. 99:7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6244"><sup>158</sup> See note 156.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6246"><sup>160</sup> What precedes was directed only to Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6247"><sup>161</sup> Ex. 34:11-26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6248"><sup>162</sup> That is, to the section that begins <italic>Behold, I send an angel before thee</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6249"><sup>163</sup> In other words, Ex. 34:11-26 is similar in content to Ex. 23:12-33. I.E. points out the aforementioned because the Sinai covenant was based on the laws contained in these chapters. Moses related the contents of Ex. 23:12-33 before bringing down the first tablets. He similarly related the contents of Ex. 34:11-26 to Israel after bringing down the second pair of tablets. See I.E.&#x2019;s comments on verses 26 and 27 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6250"><sup>164</sup> See note 163.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6251"><sup>165</sup> See note 163.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6252"><sup>166</sup> There is no parallel to this phrase in Ex. 23. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6253"><sup>167</sup> See note 163.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6254"><sup>168</sup> These verses have no parallel in Ex. 23:32. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6255"><sup>169</sup> Ex. 23:33 reads, <italic>Thou shalt not make a covenant with them nor with their gods</italic>. Scripture thus prohibits worshipping the gods of the nations. Now the term gods includes all gods. The question thus arises: Why does the earlier section speak of gods and our section of molten gods?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6256"><sup>170</sup> Ex. 23:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6257"><sup>171</sup> However, it does not mention it in chapter 23. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6259"><sup>173</sup> Lev. 23:15-21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6260"><sup>174</sup> Lev. 19:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6261"><sup>175</sup> This too recalls the Exodus.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6262"><sup>176</sup> According to I.E. the word <italic>tizachar</italic> (thou shalt sanctify as males) which governs <italic>miknekha</italic> is a feminine. (I.E. interprets <italic>tizachar</italic> as meaning, its males shall be sanctified). Hence <italic>miknekha</italic> must be a feminine. However, elsewhere <italic>miknekha</italic> is a masculine. Compare <italic>mikneh rav</italic> (a great multitude of cattle).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6263"><sup>177</sup> See I.E. on Gen. 49:20.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6267"><sup>181</sup> According to Anan, <italic>in plowing time&#x2026;thou shalt rest</italic> prohibits one from engaging in sexual intercourse on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6268"><sup>182</sup> At the time of his choosing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6269"><sup>183</sup> He does not comment. I.E. plays with the words <italic>charish</italic> (plowing) and <italic>yachcharish</italic> (is, or will be, silent).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6270"><sup>184</sup> If plowing pertains to intercourse then harvesting must refer to childbirth. Now a person can refrain from intercourse on the Sabbath but he cannot prevent his wife from giving birth on the Sabbath. Hence Anan commented on &#x201C;plow&#x201D; but refrained from commenting on the &#x201C;harvest&#x201D; because it does not fit in with his interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6271"><sup>185</sup> As it does in Ex. 23:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6272"><sup>186</sup> The diurnal sphere.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6273"><sup>187</sup> That is, a year. I.E. refers to a year as a day of the sun because it takes the sun a year to circle the earth. According to I.E. our verse may be interpreted to mean six sun days; i.e., six years shall you work your field but in the seventh sun year you shall rest. Our verse may thus be interpreted as referring both to the Sabbath and to the Sabbatical year (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6274"><sup>188</sup> Of departure. That is, it takes the sun a year to circle the heavens.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6275"><sup>189</sup> The Feast of Ingathering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6276"><sup>190</sup> Here and in Ex. 23:16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6277"><sup>191</sup> That is, Scripture reads, <italic>at the end of the year</italic> even though the Feast of Ingathering (Sukkot) falls on the 15th day of the first month of the new year, because the end of the year is the beginning of the next year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6278"><sup>192</sup> For another interpretation, see Meijler.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6279"><sup>193</sup> The constellation of Tishri.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6281"><sup>195</sup> Even though the new year is calculated from the first day of Tishri, it really begins at the start of fall.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6282"><sup>196</sup> In calculating the year, according to Samuel, it takes the sun exactly 365 and a quarter of a day (6 hours) to complete its annual circuit. See I.E. on Ex. 12:1 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6283"><sup>197</sup> According to Rav Ada it takes the sun 365 days, five hours, 55 minutes, and 25 seconds to complete its annual circuit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6284"><sup>198</sup> The point in the sky where the sun appears at the start of each of the four seasons (Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6285"><sup>199</sup> The sun was believed to move in an epicycle when at the head of Aries. This slows down its annual cycle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6286"><sup>200</sup> In Ex. 23:17 the same law appears. However, there God is referred to as <italic>the Lord God</italic>. He is not called <italic>the Lord God, the God of Israel</italic> as here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6287"><sup>201</sup> The worshippers of the calf said, <italic>This is thy god, O Israel</italic> (Ex. 32:4). Hence Scripture here emphasizes that it is the Lord who is God of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6288"><sup>202</sup> Scripture here explains why Israel will have no reason for trepidation when they go on their pilgrimages. It does not mention this in chapter 23.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6295"><sup>209</sup> These (vs. 11-26) are the conditions which Israel must accept if God is to renew His covenant with Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6296"><sup>210</sup> There was thus no reason to repeat them here.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6301"><sup>215</sup> Forty days for the first tablets and 40 days in prayer (Deut. 9:18), which culminated with the giving of the second tablets (Krinsky). It should be noted that while I.E. rejects this opinion here, he appears to accept it in Deut. 10:1 (Sarim).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6302"><sup>216</sup> According to the sages of the Talmud, Moses spent 120 days on Sinai. See <italic>Shemot Rabbah</italic> 47:12.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6306"><sup>220</sup> At the end of the 40 days of prayer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6307"><sup>221</sup> As Moses spent 40 days on Sinai the first time, so did he spend 40 days the second time. Moses thus spent 120 days on Sinai, 80 days when receiving the tablets and 40 in prayer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6308"><sup>222</sup> According to I.E. the subject of <italic>va-yikhtov</italic> (and He wrote) is God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6309"><sup>223</sup> God&#x2019;s glory.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6310"><sup>224</sup> <italic>Keren</italic> means a horn. Hence the word <italic>karan</italic>. Literally, it means horned. I.E. therefore explains that <italic>karan</italic> should be understood as sent forth beams.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6311"><sup>225</sup> That is, since <italic>Rays hath He at His side</italic> follows <italic>And a brightness appeareth as the light</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6312"><sup>226</sup> This is known as parallelism. The point is <italic>karnayim</italic> (rays) <italic>hath He at His side</italic> means the same as <italic>And a brightness appeareth as the light</italic>. Hence <italic>karnayim</italic> means rays; similarly the word <italic>karan</italic> in our verse, which is etymologically related to it, means rays.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6313"><sup>227</sup> For Chivi see I.E. on Ex. 14:23 and the notes thereto.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6314"><sup>228</sup> Chivi interprets <italic>karan or panav</italic> (the skin of his face sent forth horns) as the skin of his face horned, i.e. turned hard as a horn.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6315"><sup>229</sup> People are used to seeing ugly people. Hence there was no reason why the Israelites should have feared to approach Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6316"><sup>230</sup> That the people feared to approach Moses because of his ugliness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6317"><sup>231</sup> That Moses&#x2019; face was fresh and youthful rather than dry as a horn as Chivi maintains.</ftnote>

</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 35</title>
<h1>VA-YAKHEL</h1>
<p align="blockquote">Blessed is the most high God</p>
<p align="blockquote">Who led his people with might;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Through his messenger</p>
<p align="blockquote">Whose face shined as the light of the sun.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He commanded Moses<sup><xref rid="fn6334">1</xref></sup> on the mountain</p>
<p align="blockquote">To prepare a tent for his dwelling, as stated in</p>
<p align="blockquote">The Torah portion <italic>Va-Yakhel</italic>.</p>
<p>1. AND MOSES ASSEMBLED. <italic>Moses assembled</italic> the people so that all of them would hear, from him, the report about the tabernacle and would donate to its construction.<sup><xref rid="fn6335">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Elleh ha-devarim</italic> (these are the words) is to be interpreted as referring to the making of the tabernacle and its vessels.<sup><xref rid="fn6336">3</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads, <italic>that ye should do them</italic>. This is its meaning:<sup><xref rid="fn6337">4</xref></sup> God commanded me that you make what I will tell you.<sup><xref rid="fn6338">5</xref></sup> Now even though you are obligated to do heaven&#x2019;s work, the Lord commanded you to be careful and not do any work on the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn6339">6</xref></sup> One who violates this law before witnesses will be put to death by a court of law.<sup><xref rid="fn6340">7</xref></sup> Scripture explains elsewhere<sup><xref rid="fn6341">8</xref></sup> that he will be stoned.</p>
<p>3. YE SHALL KINDLE NO FIRE. Since Scripture earlier mentioned with regard to the first and the seventh day of the festival of unleavened bread, <italic>no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat</italic> (Ex. 12:16), namely, that it is permitted to prepare food<sup><xref rid="fn6342">9</xref></sup> on these days, it now states with regard to the Sabbath, <italic>ye shall kindle no fire</italic> to bake bread or to cook meat, for fire is required in preparing all food.</p>
<p>Rabbi Saadiah Gaon composed a very important work refuting those who dispute with the ancients regarding the Sabbath lights.<sup><xref rid="fn6343">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. AND MOSES SPOKE. Moses now began to explain to the entire congregation what God had commanded him.</p>
<p>5. TAKE. The word <italic>kechu</italic> (take) is the opposite of <italic>tenu</italic> (give). However, when a <italic>mem</italic> follows a word from the root <italic>lamed, kof, chet</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn6344">11</xref></sup> then it has the meaning of give. The meaning of <italic>kechu li</italic> (take me) in <italic>Take me, I pray thee, a little water</italic> (I Kings 17:10)<sup><xref rid="fn6345">12</xref></sup> is, take for me,<sup><xref rid="fn6346">13</xref></sup> take on my account. It is the same case with <italic>Take</italic> (kechu) <italic>ye from among you</italic> (me-ittekhem) <italic>an offering unto the Lord</italic> (la-Adonai).<sup><xref rid="fn6347">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>[WHOSOEVER IS OF A WILLING HEART.] The phrase <italic>kol nediv libbo</italic> (whosoever is of a willing heart) is irregular.<sup><xref rid="fn6348">15</xref></sup> It should be interpreted as if written <italic>kol asher nedavo libbo</italic> (all whose heart made them willing). We find the same with <italic>bi-gedol zero&#x2019;akha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6349">16</xref></sup> (By the greatness of Thine arm) (Ex. 15:16), which should be interpreted as if written <italic>bi-zero&#x2019;akha ha-gadol</italic> (by Thy great arm); and <italic>zekher rav tuvekha</italic> (the fame of Thy great goodness)<sup><xref rid="fn6350">17</xref></sup> (Ps. 145:7), which should be interpreted as if written <italic>zekher tuvekha ha-rav</italic> (the fame of goodness which is great).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua says that the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>libbo</italic> is superfluous.<sup><xref rid="fn6351">18</xref></sup> It is similar to the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>chayeto</italic> in <italic>chayeto</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6352">19</xref></sup> <italic>sadai</italic> (every beast of the field) (Ps. 104:11) and the <italic>vav</italic> of <italic>beno</italic> in <italic>beno</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6353">20</xref></sup> <italic>be&#x2019;or</italic> (Balaam the son of Beor) (Num. 24:3).</p>
<p>[LET HIM BRING IT.] After stating <italic>let him bring it</italic>, Scripture continues to explain, and goes on to say that the reference is to <italic>the Lord&#x2019;s offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6354">21</xref></sup> There are many such instances, one of them being, <italic>and he hath commanded me, my brother</italic> (I Sam. 20:29).<sup><xref rid="fn6355">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>[AND SILVER.] Some say that the word <italic>kesef</italic> (silver) is etymologically related to the word <italic>nikhsefah</italic> (yearneth) (Ps. 94:3),<sup><xref rid="fn6356">23</xref></sup> and that silver is so called because it is a delight to the eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn6357">24</xref></sup> <italic>Nechoshet</italic> (brass) is also so called because women practice magic (<italic>me-nachashot</italic>) with brass (<italic>nechoshet</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn6358">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND SCARLET. The word <italic>shani</italic> (scarlet) is here spelled without a <italic>mem</italic>. We also find it spelled with a <italic>mem</italic>. Compare <italic>shanim</italic> (scarlet) in <italic>Though your sins be as scarlet</italic> (Is. 1:18). Perhaps the latter is a plural.<sup><xref rid="fn6359">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND SKINS. The word <italic>orot</italic> (skins) is masculine.<sup><xref rid="fn6360">27</xref></sup> <italic>Luchot</italic> (tables) is similar.<sup><xref rid="fn6361">28</xref></sup> So is <italic>bechorot</italic> (firstlings) in <italic>and the firstlings of&#x2026;thy flock</italic> (Deut. 14:23).<sup><xref rid="fn6362">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>ACACIA-WOOD. <italic>Shittim</italic> (acacia),<sup><xref rid="fn6363">30</xref></sup> like the word <italic>nashim</italic> (women), is spelled with a <italic>mem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6364">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. AND OIL. Scripture does not mention pure beaten olive oil<sup><xref rid="fn6365">32</xref></sup> because this is known.<sup><xref rid="fn6366">33</xref></sup> Scripture therefore reads <italic>la-ma&#x2019;or</italic> (for the light), as is the custom.<sup><xref rid="fn6367">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses now mentioned that those who were &#x201C;willing-hearted&#x201D; should bring their offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn6368">35</xref></sup> He then went on to say that those who were certain that they were experts in the crafts should come and make [all that the Lord hath commanded].<sup><xref rid="fn6369">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses began<sup><xref rid="fn6370">37</xref></sup> with the tabernacle<sup><xref rid="fn6371">38</xref></sup> because it takes in everything.<sup><xref rid="fn6372">39</xref></sup> The tent<sup><xref rid="fn6373">40</xref></sup> served as its cover. He then mentions <italic>its covering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6374">41</xref></sup> <italic>Its covering</italic> takes in the two coverings.<sup><xref rid="fn6375">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. ITS CLASPS. The clasps of the tabernacle and the tent.<sup><xref rid="fn6376">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>ITS BARS, ITS PILLARS, AND ITS SOCKETS. The pillars for the veil and the screen.<sup><xref rid="fn6377">44</xref></sup> Scripture then mentions<sup><xref rid="fn6378">45</xref></sup> the holy vessels which were placed behind the veil.<sup><xref rid="fn6379">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. AND THE SHOWBREAD. For the table was constructed for the showbread.<sup><xref rid="fn6380">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. THE CANDLESTICK. Scripture mentions the oil for the light because the menorah was made for it.<sup><xref rid="fn6381">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THE ALTAR. Scripture concludes the account of the holy vessels. It then mentions the screen for the door. Now the vessels of the oil for the lighting, and the vessels of the anointing oil and the sweet incense, shall be placed between the veil and the screen of the door<sup><xref rid="fn6382">49</xref></sup> of the tabernacle because they are holy.</p>

<p>17. THE HANGINGS OF THE COURT, THE PILLARS THEREOF (<italic>AMMUDAV</italic>), AND THEIR SOCKETS (<italic>ADONEHAH</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn6384">51</xref></sup> Our verse is similar<sup><xref rid="fn6385">52</xref></sup> to <italic>and a great</italic> (gedolah)<sup><xref rid="fn6386">53</xref></sup> <italic>and strong</italic> (chazak)<sup><xref rid="fn6387">54</xref></sup><italic>wind</italic> (ru&#x2019;ach)<sup><xref rid="fn6388">55</xref></sup> (I Kings 19:11) and to <italic>A fire</italic> (esh) <italic>not blown</italic> (nuppach)<sup><xref rid="fn6389">56</xref></sup> <italic>by man shall consume him</italic> (te&#x2019;okhlehu)<sup><xref rid="fn6390">57</xref></sup> (Job 20:26).</p>

<p>21. AND THEY CAME, EVERY ONE WHOSE HEART STIRRED HIM UP. The reference is to the wise-hearted.<sup><xref rid="fn6393">60</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>nesa&#x2019;o libbo</italic> (whose heart stirred him up) is, whosoever had an exalted heart.<sup><xref rid="fn6394">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>[22. MEN AND WOMEN.] The meaning of <italic>al nashim</italic> (and women) is, with women.<sup><xref rid="fn6395">62</xref></sup> <italic>Al</italic> here is similar to <italic>al</italic> (with)<sup><xref rid="fn6396">63</xref></sup> in <italic>with</italic> (al) <italic>the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering</italic> (Lev. 23:20). There are many other such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn6397">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AS MANY AS WERE WILLING-HEARTED. <italic>Nediv lev</italic> (willing-hearted)<sup><xref rid="fn6398">65</xref></sup> includes willing-hearted women. The term is used in the same sense as <italic>ha-shafan</italic> (and the rock-badger)<sup><xref rid="fn6399">66</xref></sup> (Lev. 11:5) and <italic>shor seh khevasim</italic> (the ox, the sheep) (Deut. 14:4).<sup><xref rid="fn6400">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>NOSE-RINGS. <italic>Chach</italic> is an earring.<sup><xref rid="fn6401">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND EAR-RINGS. <italic>Nezem</italic> is a nose-ring.<sup><xref rid="fn6402">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND SIGNET-RINGS. <italic>Taba&#x2019;at</italic> (signet-ring) is a ring which is placed on the finger.</p>
<p>AND GIRDLES. <italic>Kumaz</italic> (girdle) is a ring which is placed around the arm.<sup><xref rid="fn6403">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND EVERY MAN. Or woman.<sup><xref rid="fn6404">71</xref></sup> In addition,<sup><xref rid="fn6405">72</xref></sup> the women spun the blue and the purple, the scarlet, the fine linen<sup><xref rid="fn6406">73</xref></sup> and also the goats&#x2019; hair,<sup><xref rid="fn6407">74</xref></sup> a craft which required exceptional skill.<sup><xref rid="fn6408">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND THE RULERS BROUGHT THE ONYX STONES, AND THE STONES TO BE SET. They had these items because when Israel left Egypt and despoiled the Egyptians,<sup><xref rid="fn6409">76</xref></sup> every Israelite asked for articles in accordance with his status.<sup><xref rid="fn6410">77</xref></sup> Now it was truly a great thing that the rulers possessed oil for the light many months after Israel left Egypt. Scripture next mentions the men and women together<sup><xref rid="fn6411">78</xref></sup> and backtracks and speaks of the women whose heart stirred them up to do the work.<sup><xref rid="fn6412">79</xref></sup> It mentions the chief,<sup><xref rid="fn6413">80</xref></sup> whom all should obey because there is no one as wise as he among them.</p>
<p>31. AND HE HATH FILLED HIM. Look. God bore witness that Bezalel was saturated with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, and in addition was skilled in all manner of workmanship.</p>
<p>32. AND TO DEVISE SKILFUL WORKS. <italic>Ve-la-chashov machashavot</italic> (and to devise skilful works) is to be interpreted as meaning: and to devise in his heart designs which were never seen.</p>
<p>[IN GOLD, AND IN SILVER.] For some people are skilled in working with gold but not in working with silver. Others are skilled stone masons but are not skilled wood carvers. However, Bezalel was a master of all of these crafts.</p>
<p>34. [AND HE HATH PUT IN HIS HEART THAT HE MAY TEACH.] In addition to the above, God put in his heart the ability to teach because there are many wise men who teach with great difficulty. Now Oholiab was Bezalel&#x2019;s colleague in all the crafts and in the skill of teaching to others. Scripture therefore says with regard to both of them, <italic>even of them that do any workmanship, and of those that devise skilful works</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6414">81</xref></sup> (v. 35).</p>
<ftnote id="fn6334"><sup>1</sup> So <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 38. The printed texts say, for commanding him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6335"><sup>2</sup> I.E comments thus because Moses did not gather all the people together to hear the other commandments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6336"><sup>3</sup> Our verse states, <italic>These are the words</italic> (elleh ha-devarim) <italic>which the Lord hath commanded, that ye should do</italic> (la&#x2019;asot) <italic>them</italic>. Now one cannot &#x201C;do&#x201D; words. Hence I.E. interprets <italic>devarim</italic> as things. He explains the verse as follows: These are the things which the Lord hath commanded that you make. So Sarim. However, Krinsky claims that I.E. explains our verse as meaning: These are the words regarding the construction of the tabernacle and its vessels which the Lord hath commanded that you make. According to this interpretation the word <italic>devarim</italic> means words as it usually does.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6347"><sup>14</sup> Its meaning is, take for me an offering for the Lord.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6348"><sup>15</sup> It is irregular for the following two reasons: a) <italic>Nediv</italic>, which is an adjective, is in the construct. An adjective does not usually come in the construct. b) <italic>Libbo</italic> is a declined noun. A declined noun is not usually preceded by a word in the construct (Filwarg). It should be noted that the literal meaning of <italic>kol nediv libbo</italic> is, whosoever willing of his heart.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6349"><sup>16</sup> <italic>Bi-gedol</italic> (by the greatness of), an adjective, is in the construct with <italic>zero&#x2019;akha</italic> (Thine arm), which is a declined noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6350"><sup>17</sup> Translated literally. <italic>Rav</italic> (great), an adjective, is in the construct with <italic>tuvekha</italic> (Thy goodness), which is a declined noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6351"><sup>18</sup> In other words, our phrase is to be read as if written, <italic>kol nediv lev</italic> (whosoever is of a willing heart). This only eliminates <italic>libbo&#x2019;s</italic> irregularity. It does not explain the. irregularity of <italic>nediv</italic> (Filwarg).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6354"><sup>21</sup> <italic>The Lord&#x2019;s offering</italic> appears to be redundant. Hence I.E. notes that it is the style of Scripture to occasionally elaborate. See I.E. on Ex. 2:6; 3:14.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6362"><sup>29</sup> <italic>Bechorot</italic> is masculine even though it has a feminine ending, for the word <italic>bechor</italic> (firstling) is masculine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6363"><sup>30</sup> The plural of <italic>shittah</italic>, which is a feminine noun. Feminine nouns usually end in a <italic>tav</italic> in the future. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6365"><sup>32</sup> Scripture reads, <italic>and oil for the light</italic>. However, in view of Ex: 27:20 it should have read: and pure beaten olive oil for the light.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6366"><sup>33</sup> It is known that the oil employed in the lighting of the menorah must be pure beaten olive oil. See Ex. 27:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6367"><sup>34</sup> Whenever Scripture refers to something that is known it employs the definite article. Hence Scripture reads <italic>la-ma&#x2019;or</italic>, which, according to I. E., means for the light, rather than <italic>le-ma&#x2019;or</italic>, for light.</ftnote>

<p>2. CALLED. The <italic>heh</italic> of the word <italic>le-korvah</italic> (to come) is superfluous.

A great scholar erred in saying that the word <italic>le-omdah</italic> (it might stand) (Ezek. 17:14) is similar, for the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>le-omdah</italic> has a <italic>mappik</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6418">4</xref></sup> in it.<sup><xref rid="fn6419">5</xref></sup> <italic>Omed</italic> is an intransitive verb.<sup><xref rid="fn6420">6</xref></sup> The meaning of <italic>le-omdah</italic> (it might stand) is therefore<sup><xref rid="fn6421">7</xref></sup> to stand by it.<sup><xref rid="fn6422">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>5. [MUCH MORE THAN ENOUGH.] The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>mi-de</italic> (much more than enough) means: much more than.

<p>FOR ALL THE WORK. That they had to do.</p>
<p>AND TOO MUCH. <italic>Ve-hoter</italic> (and too much) is an infinitive. Its meaning is, <italic>ho-tirah</italic> (and they produced more than enough).<sup><xref rid="fn6430">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. MADE. Scripture begins with the making of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>TWINED. <italic>Moshzar</italic> (twined) means long in Arabic.</p>
<p>Note that the single digit numbers<sup><xref rid="fn6431">17</xref></sup> are grammatically irregular in Hebrew. This is also the case in Aramaic. They are similarly irregular in Arabic. The <italic>heh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6432">18</xref></sup> at the end of a word indicates the feminine; the masculine does not have any sign.<sup><xref rid="fn6433">19</xref></sup> Now the <italic>heh</italic> in the number <italic>sheloshah</italic> (three) indicates the masculine.<sup><xref rid="fn6434">20</xref></sup> The same is true of the numbers <italic>arba&#x2019;ah</italic> (four), <italic>shemonah</italic> (eight), <italic>asarah</italic> (ten).<sup><xref rid="fn6435">21</xref></sup> From there<sup><xref rid="fn6436">22</xref></sup> through twenty the masculine numbers do not have a <italic>heh</italic> at the end. We thus say <italic>achad asar</italic> (eleven),<sup><xref rid="fn6437">23</xref></sup> <italic>shenem asar</italic> (twelve),<sup><xref rid="fn6438">24</xref></sup> <italic>tishah asar</italic> (nineteen).

The same applies to all of the numbers.<sup><xref rid="fn6444">30</xref></sup> Look. <italic>Shalosh</italic> (three), <italic>arba</italic> (four), and <italic>eser</italic> (ten) are feminine. If their sum is in the construct then it ends in a <italic>tav</italic> both in the masculine and in the feminine. Compare, <italic>sheloshet ha-anashim ha-elleh</italic> (these three men) (Ezek. 14:16); and <italic>u-sheloshet neshe vanav</italic> (and the three wives of his sons) (Gen. 7:13). Now the masculine form for the number eight is <italic>shemonah</italic>, as the rule says.<sup><xref rid="fn6445">31</xref></sup> The feminine is unique in that one says <italic>shemoneh</italic> (eight)<sup><xref rid="fn6446">32</xref></sup> in the same way that one says <italic>ashte esreh</italic> (eleven).<sup><xref rid="fn6447">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. [CUBITS.] It is possible that the reason our verse reads <italic>ba-ammah</italic> (cubits)<sup><xref rid="fn6448">34</xref></sup> is that it refers to a specific cubit. It possibly refers to the noble cubit of the first temple.<sup><xref rid="fn6449">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. [THE LOOPS.] The <italic>tav</italic> of <italic>ha-lula&#x2019;ot</italic> (the loops)<sup><xref rid="fn6450">36</xref></sup> indicates the feminine. The singular form of the word is <italic>lulah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6451">37</xref></sup> The <italic>heh</italic> [in <italic>lulah</italic>] takes the place of the <italic>alef</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6452">38</xref></sup> Some say that the word <italic>lalat</italic> (near to be delivered) in <italic>was with child, near to be delivered</italic> (I Sam. 4:19) comes from the same root.<sup><xref rid="fn6453">39</xref></sup></p>

<p>33. [TO PASS THROUGH.] The word <italic>livro&#x2019;ach</italic> (to pass through) is a <italic>kal</italic>. It has the same meaning as the <italic>hifil mavri&#x2019;ach</italic> (pass through).<sup><xref rid="fn6455">41</xref></sup> We find the same with the words <italic>yereh</italic> (shoot)<sup><xref rid="fn6456">42</xref></sup> and <italic>va-yoreh</italic> (and he shot)<sup><xref rid="fn6457">43</xref></sup> (II Kings 13:17).<sup><xref rid="fn6458">44</xref></sup> There are many such instances.<sup><xref rid="fn6459">45</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn6415"><sup>1</sup> The ark. See Ex. 37:1. <italic>Va-asah</italic> (shall work or shall make) is in the singular. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s interpretation (Filwarg, Krinsky).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6416"><sup>2</sup> Hence Oholiab&#x2019;s name is coupled with that of Bezalel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6417"><sup>3</sup> Which is also superfluous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6418"><sup>4</sup> A dot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6419"><sup>5</sup> The <italic>heh</italic> with a <italic>mappik</italic> means it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6420"><sup>6</sup> I.E. comments thus because an intransitive verb does not usually have a <italic>heh</italic> with a <italic>mappik</italic> suffixed to it. The <italic>heh</italic> with a <italic>mappik</italic> usually indicates the direct object.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6421"><sup>7</sup> Since <italic>le-omdah</italic> is intransitive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6422"><sup>8</sup> The covenant. In other words, <italic>heh</italic> with a <italic>mappik</italic> does not mean to stand it but to stand by it, for <italic>omed</italic> is intransitive (see note 6). I.E. interprets Ezek. 17:14 as follows: To keep his covenant and to stand (abide) by it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6423"><sup>9</sup> The children of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6424"><sup>10</sup> <italic>Ve-hem</italic> (and they) refers to the Israelites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6425"><sup>11</sup> In Ps. 119:99.</ftnote>

See <italic>Abot</italic> 4:1: &#x201C;Ben Zoma said: Who is wise? He who learns from all men; as it is said, From all (<italic>mi-kol</italic>) my teachers I have gotten understanding.&#x201D; According to I.E. it means: more than all.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6427"><sup>13</sup> The root <italic>ayin, bet, resh</italic> means to pass over. It usually refers to people or objects. Hence I.E. points out that the term is also used in reference to sound.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6428"><sup>14</sup> The Hebrew reads, <italic>ve-hamlakhah hayetah</italic>. Its literal meaning is: and the work was, which I.E.&#x2019;s interprets as the work which was done. I.E. disagrees with the definition of <italic>melakhah</italic> as stuff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6429"><sup>15</sup> The <italic>mem</italic> of <italic>dayyam</italic> is a suffix meaning for them, the reference being to the wise men mentioned in verse 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6430"><sup>16</sup> In other words, the infinitive form <italic>ve-hoter</italic> is here to be interpreted as a feminine perfect, for <italic>ve-hoter</italic> refers to <italic>melakhah</italic>, which is feminine. The work which they had done produced more than enough. So Filwarg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6431"><sup>17</sup> Literally, the ones, reading <italic>ha-achadim</italic> (the ones), as in <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 38. The printed editions read, &#x201C;Note that the number one (<italic>ha-echad</italic>) is grammatically irregular.&#x201D; The problem with this reading is that I.E. nowhere discusses &#x201C;the number one&#x201D; in his comment. Weiser suggests that our text is defective. On the other hand, Filwarg and others interpret <italic>ha-echad</italic> as <italic>achadim</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6448"><sup>34</sup> The <italic>kamatz</italic> beneath the <italic>bet</italic> indicates the definite article.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6452"><sup>38</sup> There is no <italic>alef in lulah</italic> (see notes 36 and 37). Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6453"><sup>39</sup> A woman about to deliver experiences labor pains. These pains can metaphorically be described as attaching themselves or looping themselves to the woman.

<p>1. AND BEZALEL MADE. Bezalel made the ark because of its importance.<sup><xref rid="fn6460">1</xref></sup> Bezalel also made all the holy vessels.<sup><xref rid="fn6461">2</xref></sup> Now Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn6462">3</xref></sup> mentions the tabernacle,<sup><xref rid="fn6463">4</xref></sup> the tent,<sup><xref rid="fn6464">5</xref></sup> the veil,<sup><xref rid="fn6465">6</xref></sup> and the screen,<sup><xref rid="fn6466">7</xref></sup> for they serve a similar purpose.<sup><xref rid="fn6467">8</xref></sup> Scripture then mentions the holy anointing oil with the incense of sweet spices<sup><xref rid="fn6468">9</xref></sup> because there are spices in the anointing oil and also in the sweet incense.<sup><xref rid="fn6469">10</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn6460"><sup>1</sup> This is why our verse specifies that Bezalel made the ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6461"><sup>2</sup> Though Scripture does not specifically say so. However, see Nahmanides, who writes: &#x201C;Scripture states without elaboration, <italic>and he made the table</italic> (v. 10), <italic>and he made the candelabrum</italic> (v. 17). In the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, this alludes to Bezalel, who made all the sacred vessels. But this is not my opinion, for in the case of the court of the Tabernacle it likewise says, <italic>and he made the court</italic> (Ex. 38:9), [and it would not be reasonable to say that Bezalel alone made the court]. Rather, this refers back to <italic>every wise-hearted man</italic> (Ex. 36:8) as mentioned in the making of the Tabernacle&#x201D; (Nahmanides on Ex. 36:8, Chavel translation).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6462"><sup>3</sup> In chapter 36.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6466"><sup>7</sup> Ex. 36:37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6467"><sup>8</sup> The first two served as coverings and the latter two as partitions. According to Krinsky, Sarim, and Weiser, I.E.&#x2019;s point is that Scripture tells us about the making of the sanctuary&#x2019;s structure before writing about the making of its furniture, because it is the way of the world to first build a house and then to put in the furniture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6468"><sup>9</sup> In verse 39.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6469"><sup>10</sup> I.E. was bothered by the juxtaposition of the anointing oil and the incense of the sweet spices. These two preparations did not serve a similar purpose. Why, then, list them next to each other?</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER 38</title>
<p>8. [OF THE MIRRORS.] <italic>Be-marot</italic> (of the mirrors) has a <italic>bet</italic> rather than a <italic>mem</italic> prefaced to it.<sup><xref rid="fn6470">1</xref></sup> It is proper Hebrew to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn6471">2</xref></sup> We find the same in the verse <italic>ve-ha-notar ba-basar u-va-lachem</italic> (and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread) (Lev. 8:32).<sup><xref rid="fn6472">3</xref></sup> It is the same case in Arabic.</p>
<p>[THAT DID SERVICE.] Scripture states this because it is the custom of all women to beautify themselves. They look at their faces in brass or glass mirrors every morning to arrange the head coverings<sup><xref rid="fn6473">4</xref></sup> upon their heads. These head coverings are mentioned in the Book of Isaiah.<sup><xref rid="fn6474">5</xref></sup> The custom of Israel was the same as the Moslem practice unto this very day.<sup><xref rid="fn6475">6</xref></sup> Now there were in Israel women who served God and removed themselves from the pleasures of this world. These women gave their mirrors as a free-will offering because they had no need to beautify themselves. They rather came daily to the door of the tent of meeting to pray and to hear the words of the commandments. Scripture states, <italic>that did service</italic> (tzave&#x2019;u)<sup><xref rid="fn6476">7</xref></sup> at the door of the tent of meeting because there were many such women.</p>
<p>[THE LAVER.] Scripture does not mention the dimensions of the laver as it does in the case of the lavers that Solomon made.<sup><xref rid="fn6477">8</xref></sup> The laver<sup><xref rid="fn6478">9</xref></sup> was rather made out of all the mirrors that were brought.<sup><xref rid="fn6479">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>[THE BASE.] The <italic>ken</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn6480">11</xref></sup> that is, the base,<sup><xref rid="fn6481">12</xref></sup> was in all instances the same size as the laver<sup><xref rid="fn6482">13</xref></sup> as is normally the case.</p>
<p>[12. AND FOR THE WEST SIDE.] Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn6483">14</xref></sup> refers to the west as the hinder part<sup><xref rid="fn6484">15</xref></sup> because the tent&#x2019;s opening was on the east, which is referred to as the face. Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn6485">16</xref></sup> refers to the sides which were close to the door<sup><xref rid="fn6486">17</xref></sup> as shoulders,<sup><xref rid="fn6487">18</xref></sup> for they<sup><xref rid="fn6488">19</xref></sup> are compared to the shoulders of a human being.</p>
<h1>PEKUDE</h1>
<p align="blockquote">Give thanks to God and ascribe power to Him</p>
<p align="blockquote">O &#x201C;Father of a multitude,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6489">20</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">Now that you have reached the opening of the</p>
<p align="blockquote">Torah portion <italic>Ellah Pekude</italic>.</p>
<p>21. THESE ARE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE TABERNACLE. Its meaning is: these are the accounts of the vessels of the tabernacle, for the word tabernacle includes everything.<sup><xref rid="fn6490">21</xref></sup> Scripture goes on to explain why the structure was referred to as a <italic>mishkan</italic> (tabernacle).<sup><xref rid="fn6491">22</xref></sup> It was so called because the tablets of testimony were placed in it.<sup><xref rid="fn6492">23</xref></sup> Now Scripture was brief.<sup><xref rid="fn6493">24</xref></sup> The tablets were truly a testimony, because God&#x2019;s writing was inscribed upon them.</p>
<p>[THROUGH THE SERVICE OF THE LEVITES.] Its meaning is: through the service of the Levites who carry the tabernacle and all of its vessels which Ithamar appointed to them. For the Gershonites and the Merarites were the Levites under the direction of Ithamar, who listed all the objects they were assigned to carry.<sup><xref rid="fn6494">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND BEZALEL. Scripture notes that Bezalel and Oholiab, who were first in rank,<sup><xref rid="fn6495">26</xref></sup> executed all of their tasks properly.</p>
<p>24. ALL THE GOLD. Saadiah Gaon asks, &#x201C;Why does Scripture note what was done with the silver but does not mention what the donated gold was used for?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6496">27</xref></sup> He answers, &#x201C;Look. Scripture notes that the menorah was made out of a talent of gold.<sup><xref rid="fn6497">28</xref></sup> This was also the case with the ark cover<sup><xref rid="fn6498">29</xref></sup> and the gold utilized for the ark and the altar of incense.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6499">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now this is incorrect.<sup><xref rid="fn6500">31</xref></sup> Only the menorah was entirely made of gold. This was not the case with the ark. The ark was only overlaid with gold on the inside and on the outside. The same was true of the altar of incense. The table, the staves, the boards, and the bars were all overlaid with gold. The ark cover was made completely of gold.<sup><xref rid="fn6501">32</xref></sup> According to the tradition passed on to us by our fathers the ark cover was made from a talent of gold because it was very broad and very wide.</p>
<p>I believe that Scripture mentions what they did with the silver because the silver was given for atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn6502">33</xref></sup> Observe. Scripture notes that the tabernacle, which included all the vessels, stood on the silver which the Israelites were obligated to give.<sup><xref rid="fn6503">34</xref></sup> This served as a memorial for the children of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn6504">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Who can estimate<sup><xref rid="fn6505">36</xref></sup> how much gold was needed to overlay all the vessels of the tabernacle?<sup><xref rid="fn6506">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. AND THE SILVER. Look. We learn from the sum mentioned in this verse that a talent consists of three thousand <italic>shekalim</italic>. <italic>And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation</italic> proves this.<sup><xref rid="fn6507">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. A BEKA. Half a shekel. Its meaning is: when the shekel will be broken, behold its half.<sup><xref rid="fn6508">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>FOR EVERY ONE THAT PASSED. All those that passed twenty complete years. I have already explained the reason for this.<sup><xref rid="fn6509">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. FOR CASTING. <italic>La-tzeket</italic> (for casting) comes from a root whose first letter is a <italic>yod</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6510">41</xref></sup> It is similar to the word <italic>la-redet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6511">42</xref></sup> (to descend).<sup><xref rid="fn6512">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. AND OF THE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY AND FIVE SHEKELS. Which did not serve to complete a talent.<sup><xref rid="fn6513">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. AND THE BRASS. Scripture also<sup><xref rid="fn6514">45</xref></sup> mentions the brass vessels.<sup><xref rid="fn6515">46</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn6470"><sup>1</sup> The usual way to say &#x201C;of the mirrors&#x201D; is <italic>mi-marot</italic>, for a <italic>mem</italic> prefaced to a word means from or of. On the other hand, a <italic>bet</italic> prefaced to a word means in or with. Hence our verse should have read <italic>mi-marot</italic> rather than <italic>be-marot</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6471"><sup>2</sup> In other words, the <italic>bet</italic> may be used in place of a <italic>mem</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6472"><sup>3</sup> Here too a <italic>bet</italic> is used in place of a <italic>mem</italic>, for we would expect <italic>ve-ha-notar me-ha-basar u-me-ha-lachem</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6473"><sup>4</sup> Hebrew, <italic>pe&#x2019;arim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6474"><sup>5</sup> Is. 3:20 speaks of the <italic>pe&#x2019;arim</italic> (the headtires).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6475"><sup>6</sup> Moslem women in I.E.&#x2019;s day placed head coverings on their heads. Hence I.E.&#x2019;s comment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6476"><sup>7</sup> <italic>Tzave&#x2019;u</italic> is in the plural.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6477"><sup>8</sup> Each one of the lavers made by Solomon <italic>contained forty baths</italic> (I Kings 7:38).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6482"><sup>13</sup> &#x201C;By the same size&#x201D; I.E. means that a larger laver had a larger base, a smaller laver had a smaller base.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6490"><sup>21</sup> It does not refer only to the sanctuary&#x2019;s structure; it refers to its contents as well.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6491"><sup>22</sup> The word <italic>mishkan</italic> literally means a resting place.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6496"><sup>27</sup> Scripture, in verses 27 and 28, itemizes what the silver was used for. However, it does not do the same for the gold.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6497"><sup>28</sup> Ex. 25:39.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6498"><sup>29</sup> According to Ex. 25:17 the ark cover was made of pure gold. However, it does not state how much gold was used to make it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6499"><sup>30</sup> Saadiah Gaon apparently held that since Scripture tells us that the menorah was made from a talent of gold, the same was true of the ark, the table, and the altar of incense. Thus Scripture does in fact tell us what the gold was utilized for. The remaining gold was then used for various other items. See I.E.&#x2019;s short commentary on this verse. We thus know what four talents of gold was used for.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6500"><sup>31</sup> That the ark, table, and altar of incense were each made from a talent of gold.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6501"><sup>32</sup> As noted in Ex. 25:17.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6505"><sup>36</sup> In advance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6506"><sup>37</sup> There is no way to estimate in advance precisely how much gold would be needed to overlay each one of the objects that were to be covered by gold. Hence Scripture did not itemize the amount of gold needed for each object. Nahmanides similarly comments, &#x201C;Now since one cannot know exactly how much gold went into the covering of each of these vessels, Scripture did not say that Moses gave it over to them by number and weight&#x201D; (Nahmanides on v. 8, Chavel translation).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6507"><sup>38</sup> Those numbered came to 603,350 (v. 26). Each one of those numbered gave half a <italic>shekel</italic> (v. 26). The aforementioned thus contributed 301,775 <italic>shekalim</italic>. Our verse gives the amount as 100 talents and 1,775 <italic>shekalim</italic>. Thus 100 talents &#x003D; 300,000 <italic>shekalim</italic>, which is another way of saying that one talent &#x003D; 3,000 <italic>shekalim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6508"><sup>39</sup> <italic>Beka</italic> is related to the verb <italic>baka</italic>. <italic>Baka</italic> means to break. When the shekel is broken, i.e., divided, we have half a <italic>shekel</italic>.</ftnote>

<p>1. PLAITED GARMENTS.<sup><xref rid="fn6516">1</xref></sup> These garments are the ones that are mentioned in the Torah portion <italic>Be-Midbar Sinai</italic> (in the wilderness of Sinai).<sup><xref rid="fn6517">2</xref></sup> God commanded that the ark be covered with the veil<sup><xref rid="fn6518">3</xref></sup> as a mark of honor.<sup><xref rid="fn6519">4</xref></sup> A sealskin covering was placed over the veil. A blue cloth covering was placed over this covering.<sup><xref rid="fn6520">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Logically speaking, the blue cloth covering was employed as an ark covering<sup><xref rid="fn6521">6</xref></sup> as a mark of honor<sup><xref rid="fn6522">7</xref></sup> when the weather was clear. However, if it rained then they would remove the blue cover and they would place a sealskin cover over it.<sup><xref rid="fn6523">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>A blue cloth and a cloth of scarlet were placed over the table of showbread. A cover of sealskin was placed over them.<sup><xref rid="fn6524">9</xref></sup> A blue cloth was placed over the menorah and the golden altar. A purple cloth was placed over the altar. A sealskin was placed over all of them.<sup><xref rid="fn6525">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>After mentioning the plaited garments Scripture mentions the holy garments of Aaron the high priest and then commences to describe them.</p>

<title>CHAPTER 40</title>
<p>2. ON THE FIRST DAY. We find the following difference of opinion. Some say that the eighth day of consecration<sup><xref rid="fn6541">1</xref></sup> fell on the first day of the month of Nisan.<sup><xref rid="fn6542">2</xref></sup> They were forced to say that Moses erected the tabernacle on the twenty-third day of Adar.<sup><xref rid="fn6543">3</xref></sup> Now on the first day of consecration Moses took the tabernacle apart and put it together<sup><xref rid="fn6544">4</xref></sup> in order to train the priests.<sup><xref rid="fn6545">5</xref></sup> They say<sup><xref rid="fn6546">6</xref></sup> that the goat that Moses inquired about <italic>and, behold, it was burnt</italic> (Lev. 10:16) was a new moon offering.<sup><xref rid="fn6547">7</xref></sup> Now God commanded that Moses erect the tabernacle on the first day of the first month and that he not take it apart until the ark journeyed.<sup><xref rid="fn6548">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now we find it stated in the <italic>Sifre</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6549">9</xref></sup> that Mishael and Elzaphan<sup><xref rid="fn6550">10</xref></sup> were the ones <italic>who were unclean by the dead body of a man</italic> (Num. 9:6).<sup><xref rid="fn6551">11</xref></sup> The eighth was thus the eighth day of the month.<sup><xref rid="fn6552">12</xref></sup> There is, as it were, proof of this.<sup><xref rid="fn6553">13</xref></sup> First of all, why didn&#x2019;t Scripture mention that Moses set up the tabernacle and took it apart?<sup><xref rid="fn6554">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the tabernacle was taken down there was no door of the tent of meeting. However, Scripture states, <italic>And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night</italic> (Lev. 8:35). Furthermore, Scripture writes, <italic>And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering</italic> (Lev. 9:3). It was this he-goat that Moses inquired about.<sup><xref rid="fn6555">15</xref></sup> Additionally, if this<sup><xref rid="fn6556">16</xref></sup> was a goat that served as a new moon offering, why didn&#x2019;t Scripture mention two bullocks, one ram, and seven he-lambs?<sup><xref rid="fn6557">17</xref></sup> Scripture should have read, beside the burnt offering of the new moon, as it does when it states,<sup><xref rid="fn6558">18</xref></sup> <italic>beside the burnt-offering of the morning</italic> (Num. 28:23).<sup><xref rid="fn6559">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Look. According to the plain meaning of the text, the tabernacle was first erected on the first day of the first month. Observe, they raised up this first tabernacle on the first day of the first month. They began to build the first temple, which was the second tabernacle, on the second day of the second month, called Iyyar, as Scripture clearly states, <italic>in the second day of the second month</italic> (II Chron. 3:2).<sup><xref rid="fn6560">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our Talmud writes that Israel left Egypt on the fifth day of the week.<sup><xref rid="fn6561">21</xref></sup> If they transmitted this as a tradition then we will accept it. However, if we analyze the text logically then we must conclude that they left Egypt before the fifth day of the week because there is at least three days&#x2019; difference between a simple year<sup><xref rid="fn6562">22</xref></sup> and the beginning of the next year.<sup><xref rid="fn6563">23</xref></sup> This is so because a defective year consists of three hundred and fifty-three days, three hundred and fifty of which are taken up by weeks.<sup><xref rid="fn6564">24</xref></sup> In minimal leap years<sup><xref rid="fn6565">25</xref></sup> there is a difference of five days.<sup><xref rid="fn6566">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now it appears that Moses arranged the bread on the table<sup><xref rid="fn6567">27</xref></sup> on a Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn6568">28</xref></sup> for Scripture states, <italic>Every sabbath day he shall set if</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6569">29</xref></sup> <italic>in order</italic> (Lev. 24:8).<sup><xref rid="fn6570">30</xref></sup> The tabernacle was thus erected either on the sixth day<sup><xref rid="fn6571">31</xref></sup> or on the Sabbath day.<sup><xref rid="fn6572">32</xref></sup> This appears to be the case even though the proof just offered is not irrefutable, for one can argue that the meaning of <italic>every sabbath he shall set it in order</italic> is, every Sabbath the priest shall set it in order after the tabernacle has been raised and Moses has arranged the bread.<sup><xref rid="fn6573">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observe. In describing the actual erecting of the sanctuary, Scripture tells that Moses raised up the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn6574">34</xref></sup> He erected, as I have explained, the two corner boards.<sup><xref rid="fn6575">35</xref></sup> The Levites who were of his family set up the rest of the tabernacle, for it was not the work of one person.<sup><xref rid="fn6576">36</xref></sup> He<sup><xref rid="fn6577">37</xref></sup> laid its sockets below.<sup><xref rid="fn6578">38</xref></sup> He then set the boards and bars in place.<sup><xref rid="fn6579">39</xref></sup> He then raised up the pillars for the veil and the screen of the door of the tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn6580">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Afterwards Moses spread the tent<sup><xref rid="fn6581">41</xref></sup> and put the covering of the tent over it.<sup><xref rid="fn6582">42</xref></sup> He then placed the ark<sup><xref rid="fn6583">43</xref></sup> on the western side<sup><xref rid="fn6584">44</xref></sup> and placed the tablets in the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn6585">45</xref></sup> He set the staves on the ark and placed the ark cover on top of the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn6586">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses put in the table and arranged the showbread upon it.<sup><xref rid="fn6587">47</xref></sup> Now Scripture indicates that this took place in the morning.<sup><xref rid="fn6588">48</xref></sup> Scripture states, <italic>and he lighted the lamp</italic> s(v. 25) afterwards at night.<sup><xref rid="fn6589">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moses offered the burnt offering in the morning, that is, the daily burnt offering. He did the same in the afternoon.<sup><xref rid="fn6590">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>On this day<sup><xref rid="fn6591">51</xref></sup> Moses anointed the tabernacle and all of its vessels,<sup><xref rid="fn6592">52</xref></sup> the altar of the burnt offering and all of its vessels, the laver and its base.<sup><xref rid="fn6593">53</xref></sup> The congregation was gathered at the door of the tent of meeting and Aaron and his sons washed themselves with water.<sup><xref rid="fn6594">54</xref></sup> Moses placed the holy garments upon Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn6595">55</xref></sup> He also dressed Aaron&#x2019;s sons.<sup><xref rid="fn6596">56</xref></sup> They<sup><xref rid="fn6597">57</xref></sup> were anointed with the holy oil.<sup><xref rid="fn6598">58</xref></sup> He<sup><xref rid="fn6599">59</xref></sup> brought one young bullock and two rams to the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn6600">60</xref></sup> He sacrificed the bullock and performed purification on the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn6601">61</xref></sup> He caused the designated parts<sup><xref rid="fn6602">62</xref></sup> to turn into smoke<sup><xref rid="fn6603">63</xref></sup> and slaughtered the ram.<sup><xref rid="fn6604">64</xref></sup> He dashed its blood on the altar and caused the ram to turn into smoke.<sup><xref rid="fn6605">65</xref></sup> He also slaughtered the ram of consecration and dashed its blood on the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn6606">66</xref></sup> He took the designated parts along with the right thigh and one unleavened cake and one cake of oil bread and turned all of it into smoke on the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn6607">67</xref></sup> Moses did this on each one of the seven days of consecration.<sup><xref rid="fn6608">68</xref></sup> Scripture clearly writes, <italic>And thou shalt offer the bullock of sin-offering to the day</italic>&#x2026;(Ex. 29:36), that is, daily,<sup><xref rid="fn6609">69</xref></sup>&#x2026;<italic>and you shall anoint the altar, to sanctify it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6610">70</xref></sup> Scripture further writes, <italic>Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar</italic> (Ex. 29:37) <italic>and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it</italic> (Ex. 29:36). Now its meaning is,<sup><xref rid="fn6611">71</xref></sup> Thus shall you do all the seven days of consecration.</p>
<p>Scripture states, <italic>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it</italic> and sanctified the altar for seven days of consecration (Num. 7:1).<sup><xref rid="fn6612">72</xref></sup> The princes of Israel then<sup><xref rid="fn6613">73</xref></sup> began to bring the dedication offering of the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn6614">74</xref></sup> Aaron similarly offered a bull-calf as a personal sin offering,<sup><xref rid="fn6615">75</xref></sup> and he also offered his own ram as a burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn6616">76</xref></sup> As the people&#x2019;s burnt offering he sacrificed a calf and a lamb. Aaron slaughtered the goat of the sin offering<sup><xref rid="fn6617">77</xref></sup> and treated it as a sin offering.<sup><xref rid="fn6618">78</xref></sup> He dealt with it as he did with his own calf sin offering<sup><xref rid="fn6619">79</xref></sup> with regard to dashing its blood and causing the designated parts to go up in smoke.<sup><xref rid="fn6620">80</xref></sup> However, a priest does not eat the priest&#x2019;s sin offering. The flesh of the bullock<sup><xref rid="fn6621">81</xref></sup> was therefore burned outside the camp.<sup><xref rid="fn6622">82</xref></sup> The sin offering of the congregation, which is a he-goat, is eaten by the priests.</p>
<p>All of this took place after the morning burnt offering was offered. After all of this, he [Aaron] offered the burnt offering and sin offering of Nahshon.<sup><xref rid="fn6623">83</xref></sup> The dedication of the altar was thus finished after nineteen days of the first month<sup><xref rid="fn6624">84</xref></sup> had passed.<sup><xref rid="fn6625">85</xref></sup> Do not pay attention to the one who argues, &#x201C;If this is the case<sup><xref rid="fn6626">86</xref></sup> then when did they offer the festival sacrifices?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6627">87</xref></sup> Israel observed the festival of Passover<sup><xref rid="fn6628">88</xref></sup> in the desert of Sinai for only one night.<sup><xref rid="fn6629">89</xref></sup> They did not keep the festival of unleavened bread,<sup><xref rid="fn6630">90</xref></sup> for Scripture clearly states, <italic>And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee</italic> [<italic>into the land of the Canaanite</italic>] (Ex. 13:5)&#x2026;<italic>Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread</italic> (Ex. 13:6).<sup><xref rid="fn6631">91</xref></sup> <italic>And this day shall be unto you for a memorial</italic> (Ex. 12:14) refers to the next generation. It commands the next generation to establish the day that Israel left Egypt, as a holy convocation. Look&#x0021; They journeyed from Goshen on the first day.<sup><xref rid="fn6632">92</xref></sup> Furthermore, Israel did not have bread<sup><xref rid="fn6633">93</xref></sup> from which to make unleavened bread for seven days in the desert of Sinai even though they were close to an inhabited place.<sup><xref rid="fn6634">94</xref></sup> It was a great thing that they found material out of which to make unleavened bread to eat with the bitter herbs and paschal lamb on the one night,<sup><xref rid="fn6635">95</xref></sup> for they were a very great multitude of people.</p>
<p>Now logically speaking, Moses offered the daily burnt offering<sup><xref rid="fn6636">96</xref></sup> during the seven days of consecration and two lambs on the Sabbath day.<sup><xref rid="fn6637">97</xref></sup> He offered the Sabbath burnt offering and then the consecration burnt offerings on which day of the seven days of consecration fell on a Sabbath. All of this is correct. However, what shall we do with the dedication of the altar<sup><xref rid="fn6638">98</xref></sup> on the Sabbath day?<sup><xref rid="fn6639">99</xref></sup> Some say that they skipped the Sabbath day.<sup><xref rid="fn6640">100</xref></sup> They only counted the days that they dedicated the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn6641">101</xref></sup> Others say that the princes&#x2019; burnt offering was offered on the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn6642">102</xref></sup> However, the peace offerings<sup><xref rid="fn6643">103</xref></sup> were slaughtered and eaten on the first day of the week. Their proof is as follows. The prince<sup><xref rid="fn6644">104</xref></sup> who sacrifices<sup><xref rid="fn6645">105</xref></sup> offers six lambs on the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn6646">106</xref></sup> aside from the congregation&#x2019;s burnt offering.<sup><xref rid="fn6647">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first group<sup><xref rid="fn6648">108</xref></sup> says that when they circled Jericho for six days with the armed body in the lead<sup><xref rid="fn6649">109</xref></sup> they similarly skipped the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn6650">110</xref></sup> Behold, they circled Jericho for seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn6651">111</xref></sup> They say the same with regard to the fourteen days.<sup><xref rid="fn6652">112</xref></sup> They skipped the Day of Atonement and did not count it.</p>
<p>[34. THEN THE CLOUD COVERED.] Logically speaking, when the tabernacle was erected and Moses went out, the cloud covered the tabernacle and the glory of the Lord filled it.<sup><xref rid="fn6653">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. AND MOSES WAS NOT ABLE TO ENTER. Then God called Moses and told him to enter the tent. Moses used to speak with God face to face in the place where the high priest entered once a year with a cloud of incense,<sup><xref rid="fn6654">114</xref></sup> because Moses was, as it were, a member of the house.<sup><xref rid="fn6655">115</xref></sup> I was forced to say this<sup><xref rid="fn6656">116</xref></sup> because Moses put the tablets in the ark. He similarly placed over the ark the covering with the cherubim on top. God&#x2019;s glory was always upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn6657">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now what happened when Aaron and his sons took down the veil of the screen<sup><xref rid="fn6658">118</xref></sup> outside the place where the ark was kept?<sup><xref rid="fn6659">119</xref></sup> How did they approach it?<sup><xref rid="fn6660">120</xref></sup> I therefore say that Moses alone entered beyond the veil. Aaron and his sons then took down the screen, which is called the veil.<sup><xref rid="fn6661">121</xref></sup> Moses used to take the screen and immediately cover the ark of the covenant with it so that Aaron and his sons would not see it. Scripture writes, <italic>and they shall cover the ark of testimony</italic> (Num. 4:5)<sup><xref rid="fn6662">122</xref></sup> because they assisted Moses. Others say that the priests covered the ark but did not face it.<sup><xref rid="fn6663">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture states, <italic>and there was fire therein by night</italic>, and then goes on to say, <italic>throughout all their journeys</italic> (v. 38). This<sup><xref rid="fn6664">124</xref></sup> also indicates that at times the cloud journeyed at night.<sup><xref rid="fn6665">125</xref></sup> Now we do not find it written that they journeyed at night.<sup><xref rid="fn6666">126</xref></sup> The one who says this<sup><xref rid="fn6667">127</xref></sup> explains <italic>or if it continued by day and by night</italic> (Num. 9:21) as referring to one day.<sup><xref rid="fn6668">128</xref></sup> Now what will they do with the phrase <italic>their journeys</italic> (v. 38)? Scripture does not read: throughout all their encampments.<sup><xref rid="fn6669">129</xref></sup> The correct meaning of <italic>or&#x2026;by day and by night</italic> is: or day and night; or: or day or night.<sup><xref rid="fn6670">130</xref></sup> It is similar to <italic>And he that curseth his father and his mother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn6671">131</xref></sup> <italic>shall surely be put to death</italic> (Ex. 21:17).<sup><xref rid="fn6672">132</xref></sup> I had to say this because I noticed that the prayer which Moses uttered on the occasion of the scouts states, <italic>and thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night</italic> (Num. 14:14).<sup><xref rid="fn6673">133</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn6541"><sup>1</sup> The day after the seven days of consecration. See Lev. 9:1-24. For the seven days of consecration, see Lev. 8:1-36. During these days of consecration Aaron and his sons were invested in their duties, the tabernacle furniture was anointed, and special sacrifices were offered in the tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6542"><sup>2</sup> <italic>See Seder Olam</italic> 7:1: &#x201C;The seven days of consecration began on the 23 of Adar and concluded on the first day of Nisan.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6543"><sup>3</sup> That is, that Moses first erected the tabernacle on the 23 day of Adar. They were forced to say this because Scripture tells us that special sacrifices were offered during the period of consecration. These sacrifices could not be offered without the tabernacle standing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6544"><sup>4</sup> On the next day. See I.E. on Num. 9:1. In other words, Moses set up the tabernacle and took it down during each one of the first seven days of consecration.

<ftnote id="fn6546"><sup>6</sup> In keeping with their opinion that the eighth day of consecration described in Lev. 9 took place on the first day of Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6547"><sup>7</sup> Concerning the offerings brought on the new moon see Num. 28:11-15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6548"><sup>8</sup> See Num. 10:11,35. According to this opinion when our verse relates that God told Moses, <italic>On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle</italic>, it means: on the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle and not take it apart until the ark journeys. Those who interpret our verse thus do so because they believe that Moses first erected the tabernacle on the 23 day of Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6549"><sup>9</sup> <italic>Sifre</italic> on Num. 9:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6550"><sup>10</sup> Mishael and Elzaphan were the nephews of Aaron. They carried the bodies of Nadab and Abihu from the tabernacle after their demise in the sanctuary on the eighth day of consecration. See Lev 10:1-5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6551"><sup>11</sup> They consequently could not offer the Passover sacrifice on the 14th of Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6552"><sup>12</sup> A person who touches a dead body is unclean for seven days (Num. 19:11). If Mishael and Elzaphan were unclean on the 14th of Nisan because they removed the dead bodies of their cousins from the tabernacle on the eighth day, then that day had to fall on the 8th day of Nisan rather than on the first. Now if the eight day fell on the 8th of Nisan, then the first day of consecration fell on the first day of Nisan. The tabernacle was thus erected for the first time on the first day of Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6553"><sup>13</sup> That the tabernacle was first set up on the first day of Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6554"><sup>14</sup> As maintained by those who say that the temple was built for the first time on the 23rd of Adar. See note 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6555"><sup>15</sup> Rather than the he-goat offered on the new moon, as stated by those who maintain that the eight day fell on the first day of Nisan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6556"><sup>16</sup> The goat which Moses inquired about.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6557"><sup>17</sup> If the eighth day took place on a new moon then why does Lev. 9 only mention the new moon he-goat and not the other new moon offerings? For two bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs, and a he-goat were offered on the new moon. See Num. 28:11-15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6558"><sup>18</sup> With regard to the Passover offerings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6559"><sup>19</sup> If the consecration offerings brought on the eighth day were offered on the new moon, Scripture should have indicated that these offerings were brought in addition to the burnt offering of the new moon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6560"><sup>20</sup> II Chron. 3:2 reads: <italic>And he began to build</italic> [the House of God] <italic>in the second day of the second month</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6561"><sup>21</sup> <italic>Sabbath</italic> 87b; <italic>Seder Olam</italic> 5:3. See I.E. on Ex. 16:1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6562"><sup>22</sup> That is, a defective year. A defective year is one that consists of 353 days. A Hebrew year can consist of 353, 354, or 355 days. See note 36 to Gen. 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6563"><sup>23</sup> That is, there is at least a three-day difference between the day of the week on which the year begins from one year to the other, if the first of the two years is a defective year. The difference will be more if the year has 354 or 355 days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6564"><sup>24</sup> There are 50 weeks in a regular year, for 50 &#x00D7; 7 &#x003D; 350. Thus a defective year consists of 50 weeks plus 3 days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6565"><sup>25</sup> A leap year consists of 383 days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6566"><sup>26</sup> There is a difference of five days between the end of the last year and the beginning of the next. A minimal leap year consists of 383 days (353 days plus a month). 383 days comes to 54 weeks and 5 days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6567"><sup>27</sup> Verse 4 tells us that Moses was to bring the table into the tabernacle and arrange the bread on it on the day the tabernacle was erected. The tabernacle was thus erected on a Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6568"><sup>28</sup> Hence it is not possible for the 15th day of Nisan in the previous year to have fallen on a Thursday. For if the 15th of Nisan fell on a Thursday, then the first day of Nisan also had to fall on a Thursday and consequently could not fall on a Saturday or a Friday the following year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6569"><sup>29</sup> The showbread.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6570"><sup>30</sup> Thus the showbread could be placed on the table only on a Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6571"><sup>31</sup> Very close to the onset of the Sabbath (Filwarg).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6572"><sup>32</sup> In view of the fact that the Torah states that the showbread should be on the table <italic>before the Lord continually</italic>, I.E. believes it unlikely for Moses to have set up the tabernacle a day or more before the Sabbath, thus leaving the table bereft of the bread.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6573"><sup>33</sup> In other words, Lev. 24:8 does not apply to the first time that Moses set up the tabernacle. Moses could have set up the tabernacle on any day of the week and placed the showbread on it. After this, the bread had to be placed on the table only on a Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6574"><sup>34</sup> Verse 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6575"><sup>35</sup> According to I.E. the two corner boards mentioned in Ex. 26:23 were set up first when the tabernacle was raised. The rest of the tabernacle was then attached to these boards. See I.E. on Ex. 26:18. I.E. now adds the fact that Moses set up these two boards and that Scripture considers it as if he had erected the entire tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6576"><sup>36</sup> It was beyond the ability of Moses to raise up the entire tabernacle by himself.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn6627"><sup>87</sup> According to I.E. the princes of Israel started to bring their dedication sacrifices on the eight day of Nisan. Thus five of the princes offered their dedication sacrifices during the time of the festival seasons. Those who have this opinion believe that if the priests were occupied with the dedication sacrifices of the princes they had no time to offer the Passover sacrifices. According to Meijler this opinion holds that Scripture should have mentioned the Passover sacrifices along with the sacrifices offered by the princes on the days that coincided with Passover. This question relates only to I.E.&#x2019;s point of view. According to the opinion that the &#x201C;eighth day&#x201D; fell on the first of Nisan, the princes finished bringing their dedication offerings on the 12th day of Nisan, three days before the start of Passover, and consequently there is no problem.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6628"><sup>88</sup> That is, they sacrificed the paschal lamb on the 14th of Nisan and ate its flesh on the night of the 15th. It should be noted that in Scripture, Passover refers to the 14th of Nisan, when the paschal lamb is sacrificed, and the feast of unleavened bread to the seven days which follow. See note 86.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6629"><sup>89</sup> See Num. 9:1-6. Scripture there tells us that Israel observed the Passover in the first month of the second year following the Exodus from Egypt. The feast of unleavened bread is not mentioned. It is I.E.&#x2019;s contention that this is the only Passover that Israel celebrated during their sojourn in the wilderness of Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6630"><sup>90</sup> Which begins on the eve of the 15th of Nisan and lasts for seven days. See Ex. 12:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6631"><sup>91</sup> We thus see that the obligation to observe the feast of unleavened bread begins only when Israel enters the land of Canaan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6632"><sup>92</sup> That is, on the first of what would eventually be the seven days of the festival of unleavened bread, for Israel left Egypt on the 15th of Nisan. See Num. 33:3. I.E.&#x2019;s point is that Israel did not observe the festival of unleavened bread till they entered Canaan. He points out that they did not keep this festival in Egypt where they could buy flour for their unleavened bread because they did not spend the seven days of the festival period in Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6633"><sup>93</sup> That is, flour. Hence they could not celebrate the festival of unleavened bread in the desert of Sinai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6634"><sup>94</sup> Where they could have bought provisions if they felt themselves obligated to do so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6635"><sup>95</sup> On which they celebrated the Passover. See note 85.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6636"><sup>96</sup> See Ex. 29:38-42; Num. 28:1-8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6637"><sup>97</sup> Num. 28:9,10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6638"><sup>98</sup> That is, the sacrifices offered for the dedication of the altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6639"><sup>99</sup> Each one of the 12 princes of Israel offered dedication sacrifices on each one of the 12 days following the seven days of consecration. See note 72. Now only those sacrifices mandated by the Torah may be sacrificed on the Sabbath. Personal offerings cannot be sacrificed on the Sabbath. Hence the question raised by I.E.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6640"><sup>100</sup> The princes of Israel did not offer their dedication sacrifice on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6641"><sup>101</sup> In other words, when the Torah tells us that the princes of Israel offered 12 sacrifices on the 12 days following the seven days of consecration it does not mean that they offered them on 12 successive days, for they skipped the Sabbath day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6642"><sup>102</sup> See note 72.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6643"><sup>103</sup> Which the prince should have offered on the Sabbath. See note 72.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6644"><sup>104</sup> The reference is not to any of the princes mentioned in our chapter but rather to the prince mentioned in Ezek. 46.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6645"><sup>105</sup> Literally, the one who sends. <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 38 reads, The prince, that is, the king.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6646"><sup>106</sup> See Ezek. 46:4, <italic>And the burnt-offering that the prince shall offer unto the Lord shall be in the sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6647"><sup>107</sup> That is, aside from the congregation&#x2019;s burnt offering, six lambs sent by the prince are sacrificed on the Sabbath. These six lambs are burnt offerings. We thus see that a prince&#x2019;s burnt offering may be sacrificed on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6648"><sup>108</sup> The group mentioned earlier, who maintain that the princes did not offer their altar dedication sacrifices on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6649"><sup>109</sup> See Josh. 6:6-15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6650"><sup>110</sup> In order not to violate the Sabbath. This opinion apparently held that the Sabbath fell during the six days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6651"><sup>111</sup> Josh. 6:15. They circled Jericho once a day for six days and seven times on the seventh day. This opinion maintains that they did not circle Jericho for seven successive days, for if they had done so they would have desecrated the Sabbath. This interpretation maintains that <italic>And it came to pass on the seventh day</italic> (<italic>Ibid.</italic>) does not refer to the Sabbath but rather to the seventh day of circling. It should be noted that according to the rabbis, Jericho fell on a Sabbath. See <italic>Tal. Jer. Sabbath</italic> 1:5, <italic>Seder Olam</italic> 11, <italic>Ba-Midbar Rabbah</italic> 14:1; 23:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6652"><sup>112</sup> The 14 days comprised the seven on which King Solomon celebrated the dedication of the temple plus the seven days of Sukkot. See I Kings 8:65: <italic>So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great congregation&#x2026;before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days</italic>. They say that these 14 days were not celebrated back to back, for if they had been, then Israel would have eaten on the Day of Atonement. It should be noted that according to the rabbis these 14 days were celebrated back to back and that Israel ate on Yom Kippur that year. See <italic>Mo&#x2019;ed Katan</italic> 9a. Also see Kimchi on I Kings 8:65.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6653"><sup>113</sup> Literally, then the cloud. In other words, God&#x2019;s glory did not fill the tabernacle while Moses was in it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6654"><sup>114</sup> That is, in the Holy of Holies. See Lev. 16:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6655"><sup>115</sup> God&#x2019;s house. Hence God called to him to enter the Holy of Holies on ordinary days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6656"><sup>116</sup> That Moses entered the Holy of Holies whenever God spoke to him (Meijler).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6657"><sup>117</sup> Upon the cherubim. Hence Moses had already seen God&#x2019;s glory (Krinsky). He was thus, as it were, a member of God&#x2019;s house.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6658"><sup>118</sup> Which separated the Holy from the Holy of Holies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6659"><sup>119</sup> See Num. 4:5: <italic>when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of testimony with it</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6660"><sup>120</sup> Since God&#x2019;s glory was upon the ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6661"><sup>121</sup> I.E. interprets <italic>parokhet ha-masekh</italic> (the veil of the screen) as the <italic>parokhet</italic>, that is, the screen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6662"><sup>122</sup> Translated literally.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6663"><sup>123</sup> So that they would not gaze upon God&#x2019;s glory.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6664"><sup>124</sup> In addition to Num. 14:14. See below.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6665"><sup>125</sup> Some conclude on the basis of the aforementioned that at times the cloud journeyed at night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6666"><sup>126</sup> Scripture never explicitly states that Israel journeyed at night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6667"><sup>127</sup> That Scripture never explicitly states that Israel journeyed at night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6668"><sup>128</sup> Num. 9:21 states, <italic>And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed; or if it continued by day and by night</italic> (o yomam va-laylah), <italic>when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed</italic>. Now <italic>o yomam va-laylah</italic> can be translated in two ways: a) Or it continued by day and by night. b) Or it continued for a day or for a night. According to the latter translation our verse reads, &#x201C;or if it continued by day or by night (o <italic>yomam va-laylah</italic>) when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.&#x201D; Thus the verse teaches that Israel at times traveled at night. Hence those who maintain that Israel did not journey at night interpret <italic>o yomam va-laylah</italic> as referring to a 24-hour period, that is, a day and a night. This opinion interprets <italic>o yomam va-laylah</italic> as: or it continued by day and by night, that is, a full day consisting of a day and a night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6669"><sup>129</sup> If Scripture intended to teach that they journeyed during the day and camped at night, then our verse should have read: For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their &#x201C;encampments,&#x201D; rather than <italic>For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their &#x201C;journeys.&#x201D;</italic> The latter implies that Israel journeyed at night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6670"><sup>130</sup> In other words, Israel journeyed at night. Our text literally reads, &#x201C;Its meaning is (<italic>u-pirusho</italic>), or day and night, or, or day or night.&#x201D; This reading is a bit difficult. I.E. is trying to prove that Israel journeyed at night. Hence why mention the interpretation, or day and night (see note 122). Indeed, <italic>Vat. Ebr.</italic> 38 reads, &#x201C;Its meaning is (<italic>u-pirusho</italic>), or day or night.&#x201D; If we emend <italic>pirusho</italic> to <italic>pirush</italic> then our text reads, &#x201C;The meaning of (<italic>u-pirush</italic>) <italic>Or&#x2026;by day and by night</italic> is: or day or night.&#x201D; This is probably the reading upon which our text is based, for <italic>pirusho</italic> seems to be a scribal error for <italic>pirush</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6671"><sup>131</sup> Hebrew, <italic>aviv ve-immo</italic> (his father and his mother).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6672"><sup>132</sup> Translated literally. The meaning of Ex. 21:17 is, And he that curseth his father &#x201C;or&#x201D; his mother shall surely be put to death. We thus see that the <italic>vav</italic> sometimes has the meaning of or. Similarly, <italic>yomam va-laylah</italic> is not to be rendered day and night but rather day or night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6673"><sup>133</sup> This verse implies that Israel journeyed at night, for <italic>prima facie, and Thou goest before them</italic> also refers to <italic>and in a pillar of fire by night</italic>.</ftnote>
