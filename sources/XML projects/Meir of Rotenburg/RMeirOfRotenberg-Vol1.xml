<p><italic>Q</italic>. Is it proper to wear <italic>zizith</italic> (fringes) made of flax?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. No, flaxen <italic>zizith</italic> are permitted to be worn only with a flaxen <italic>talith</italic>. But since it is not proper to wear a flaxen <italic>talith</italic> (cloak), one must never wear flaxen <italic>zizith</italic>.</p>

<h1><bold>2</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. If a person has a burn on his arm, how can he put on the phylactery of the arm?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. There is enough room on the arm for two phylacteries; he can therefore, put it either above or below his burn.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Must a person who puts on only the phylactery of the head say both blessings [<italic>Lehaniah Tefilin</italic>, and <italic>Al Mitsvat Tefilin</italic>]?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Authorities differ on this law, Rashi requiring one blessing and R. Amram and R. Tam requiring two blessings. I am inclined to agree with the last two that he must say both blessings.</p>

<h1><bold>4</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. Is a person who has had a nocturnal pollution permitted to put on the phylacteries?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The custom is widely accepted to permit such a person to study the Torah, to recite his prayers, and to put on his phylacteries.</p>

<h1><bold>5</bold></h1>
<p>Phylacteries which lost their square shape through age and use must be reshaped before they can be used. But <italic>zizith</italic> (fringes) are fit for use at any time if, when they were made, they were of the required shape and size.</p>

<h1><bold>6</bold></h1>
<p>R. Tam decided that a minor may not be counted among the ten men required to make up a <italic>minyan</italic>, and we can not go against his decision. Therefore, when you find yourself in a position where the other congregants are about to count a minor among the required ten, the best thing for you to do is to leave the synagogue, and thus avoid being the cause of a transgression.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. In a town where there are only two or three Israelites and many <italic>Kohanim</italic>, or where there are only <italic>Kohanim</italic> and no Israelites, who should be called up to read the Torah?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Where there are only two or three Israelites, they should be called up several times, after one <italic>Kohen</italic> has read the first two portions, until the seven portions are read. If there are no Israelites, women and children are called up in their place. But, if there are only <italic>Kohanim</italic> and no women or children, the Torah may not be read, as no <italic>Kohen</italic> may be called up to the third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh portions of the readings, lest the onlookers get the impression that he is not of pure lineage.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Is a <italic>Kohen</italic> permitted to board a boat wherein a dead body is lying?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the boat is small so that it shakes whenever a person walks thereon, a <italic>Kohen</italic> may not board it since he is bound to shake the body. If the boat is large, he may board it, but he is not permitted to come within four cubits of the body.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Many of our ritual customs are based on the <italic>Siddur</italic> of Rav Amram, the <italic>Halakot Gedolot</italic>, and the tractate <italic>Soferim</italic>. From these sources we have derived our custom that the first seven persons read the portion of the week, and the <italic>maftir</italic> (one who concludes the reading of the Torah) reads the portion pertaining to the special occasion.</p>

<h1><bold>18</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A donated a plot of ground to the community for the purpose of erecting a synagogue thereon. However, when the members of the community made ready to build the synagogue they were restrained by the &#x201C;students of Jesus&#x201D; (probably theological students). The community, therefore, decided to build a Talmudical school instead; whereupon A objected that he did not donate the ground for such purpose.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since A did not originally stipulate the condition that in case a synagogue is not built on said ground, it shall revert to him, he may no longer withdraw his gift, and the ground belongs to the community who can use it for any purpose it sees fit. The mere designation of an object for a sacred purpose does not sanctify the object, and it may still be used for a secular purpose. Therefore, were A not a resident of that town, the community would be free to use said ground for building the school. But if A is a resident of that town, since a community can not use for one purpose, community property originally designated for another purpose, unless such change be unanimously approved by the members of the community, or approved by a resident, outstanding scholar of the caliber of R. Ashi, the community can not build a school on the ground, since the protest of A does not permit a unanimous approval of the plan. Therefore, the community can do nothing with the ground till either the Christian priests permit them to build a synagogue, or A withdraws his objection.</p>

<h1><bold>19</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. The oil-lamp of our synagogue emits a dense smoke which causes damage to the congregants and occasionally compels them to leave the synagogue altogether. Some persons have donated money for the purpose of buying oil for the synagogue. Must we continue to bear the smoke of the oil-lamp, or may we divert the donated money to another purpose?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The money may be used for buying waxen candles. The purpose for which the money was given may be changed by the members of the synagogue (though it can not be so changed by the donor) for the following reasons: a) Preparing an object for sacred use does not sanctify the object until it is actually used for such purpose; b) candles and oil used in a synagogue are not intrinsically sacred; nor are they even considered <italic>tashmishe kedushah</italic> (objects used for a sacred function) since they are not indispensable to the function of the synagogue.</p>

<h1><bold>20</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. Are we permitted to make use of the garret of the synagogue building? I see no reason why its use should be prohibited, since even the garrets of the <italic>Azarah</italic> (Temple court) were not invested with holiness.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. I know of no actual prohibition against making use of the synagogue building, but we should be very careful not to perform there any profane, degrading, or indecent acts, since the prohibition against such acts is implied in the talmudic statement (Shab. 11a): &#x201C;a city, the houses of which tower above the synagogue, will eventually be destroyed.&#x201D;</p>

<h1><bold>21</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A customarily bought the honors connected with the second scroll of the Law of the synagogue. This time, however, the community sold these honors to B for half a pound. Now A seeks to exercise his priority rights in the acquisition of such honors.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If, when the community sold the honors to B, A was in a position to pay half a pound for them but failed to do so, he forfeited his rights to them when he consented to their being sold to B. Therefore, if witnesses testify that A had originally consented to such sale together with the rest of the community, A has no claim to these honors. Or, in the absence of such testimony, if witnesses testify to B&#x2019;s undisturbed possession &#x2014; since B claims that A had consented to the sale &#x2014; the honors belong to B. However, if, when the honors were sold to B, A could not afford to buy them, but now that he has the means he wants to recoup his rights and privileges, A is entitled to his rights of priority.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A and B inherited from their father the sole right to make alterations or additions to the synagogue building. A desires to sell his privilege to a wealthy man.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The privilege given to A&#x2019;s father, was personal to him and his children, and, therefore, cannot be sold without the consent of the community. Every right, privilege, and authority over the Jewish public, such as the priesthood, kingship, service of the Levites, or even the post of <italic>parnas</italic>, is given to be enjoyed by a person and his children, but must not be sold to another.</p>

<h1><bold>23</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. The father of R. Zadok, R. Zadok himself, and his sons, have successively had for eighty years the honor of providing the synagogue with wine for <italic>kiddush</italic> and <italic>habdalah</italic>. Another member of the community now offers to give one <italic>mark</italic> per year, if he is permitted to provide the wine.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the sons of R. Zadok have had the honor of providing the wine for more than three years, and since there are witnesses that their father had that honor before them, we put forth the claim on their behalf that their father or grandfather bought from the community the exclusive right to this honor for himself and for his descendants. Even if the honor was not sold to the grandfather, but the community agreed to grant it to him or his son, it cannot be taken away from R. Zadok&#x2019;s children, for the law requires that children should inherit their father&#x2019;s position and authority in the community, if they are worthy of doing so.</p>
<p>This Responsum is addressed to Rabbi Samuel.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Sinai VI (1943) 13, no. 420.</p>
<h1><bold>24</bold> (D)</h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claims: (1) that he pledged a Scroll of the Law with the synagogue, as security for money he owed to a holy cause; (2) that without his knowledge or permission the trustees sold the Scroll to B; (3) that when he learned about the sale, he protested to B who said to him: &#x201C;If the Scroll is still in the city, it is yours;&#x201D; and (4) that the Scroll was in the city at the time. A, therefore, demands that B return the Scroll to him. B, however, claims: (1) that he bought the Scroll for five pounds from the leaders of the community in the presence of the Rabbi; (2) that the beadle delivered possession of the Scroll to him; (3) that while buying the Scroll, he specified that he was donating it to his community and thus received it for half a pound less than the price asked for; and (4) that he had already donated it to his community and it was thus out of his hands.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since B bought the Scroll from reliable people, the sale is valid. B, however, would do a praiseworthy deed were he to return the Scroll to A and take his money back, since this method of acquiring a <italic>Mitzvah</italic>, by depriving one of the opportunity to redeem his property, is not commendable.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. I placed a carpet on the stone floor in front of the ark of our synagogue, for, whenever the cantor would fall on his face in prayer, it would appear as if he were bowing (in adoration) to the stones. Was my act justified?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. You have done a meritorious act. For bowing on a stone floor even without extending the arms and legs, is forbidden by Rabbinic enactment. Although many venerable men are very careful and turn sideways instead of prostrating themselves (cf. Ber. 34b), yet many ignorant cantors actually fall on their faces in prayer. If it will be within my power, I shall abolish this practice. I shall proceed cautiously, however, in order not to create undue disturbance.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Does a minor complete the quorum necessary for the purpose of mentioning the name of God in the invocation to grace after the meal?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. There are many conflicting opinions on this subject. R. Tam held that such a minor could complete the necessary quorum, but he himself did not permit such a practice. I have seen many great authorities doing so. But when I was in Provence I said grace several times at the table of my great teacher in the presence of nine men and one minor in his thirteenth year, and he did not allow me to mention the name of God in the invocation. Subsequently I inquired of my teacher R. Judah whether my great teacher was correct in forbidding me to mention God&#x2019;s name; and he replied that he was, thus confirming his opinion.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. When are we supposed to recite the blessing &#x201C;over the washing of hands?&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The blessing &#x201C;over the washing of hands&#x201D; is recited when one washes his hands upon rising from bed.

<p><italic>A</italic>. There exists a difference of opinion among the Geonim, but I believe that he should wash his hands once, and recite two blessings: the first &#x201C;on the washing of hands&#x201D; and the second &#x201C;who has created Man&#x201D;, and then eat.</p>

Since reciting the blessing over the wine of <italic>kiddush</italic> and <italic>habdalah</italic> obviates the necessity of reciting another blessing over the wine drunk during and after the meal, the drinking of the wine of <italic>kiddush</italic> and <italic>habdalah</italic> forms part of the meal, and the reciting of the <italic>al hagefen</italic> after such wine and before the meal is unnecessary.</p>

Were it not for this reason, the practice of lighting many candles in the synagogue for Friday evening services, when a holiday falls on Friday, would be forbidden, since services are usually over before dark and the candles are not needed for their light; and the lighting of many candles on a holiday night would be forbidden, since a single candle dispels darkness.

<p>Rabbi Samuel of Eisenach, a relative of R. Meir, permitted the eating of ritually slaughtered chickens with which a <italic>trefah</italic> chicken was mixed up. He based his decision on an opinion he said he had received from R. Jacob, that the law stated in Mishna Ab. Z. 5, 9, and interpreted in the Talmud Ab. Z. 74a, is the accepted law governing mixtures. This talmudic interpretation implies, that only objects possessing both characteristics: a) items usually sold by the piece, and b) forbidden objects, the profitable use of which is prohibited (<italic>issurei hanaah</italic>), are never neutralized in a mixture. However, objects lacking one of these characteristics do become neutralized in the proper mixture.</p>
<p>R. Meir took issue with R. Samuel, pointing out, that the accepted authorities never mention the foregoing view as the final law. On the contrary, these authorities decide that items usually sold by the piece, even though they be not forbidden objects the profitable use of which is prohibited, are never neutralized. Moreover, R. Samuel contradicted himself and ruled that a &#x201C;piece fit to be offered a guest&#x201D;, even though it be not <italic>issurei hanaah</italic>, is not neutralized; but a whole chicken is also considered &#x201C;a piece fit to be offered a guest&#x201D;.

<p><italic>A</italic>. When a Gentile pours wine from a vessel, that part of the wine which is already outside of the vessel is considered &#x201C;forbidden wine&#x201D; because the Gentile exerted energy in pouring it from the vessel. When the Gentile stops pouring the wine, the last drop dribbling from the vessel is still considered &#x201C;forbidden wine&#x201D; because of the energy exerted, while the drop with which it was in contact and which separated from it and remained in the vessel not only itself should become &#x201C;forbidden wine&#x201D;, because of its actual contact with the last drop that dribbled from the vessel, but should render the rest of the wine in the vessel &#x201C;forbidden&#x201D;. This actual contact of the wine remaining in the vessel with that poured out of it, is termed &#x201C;wine touches wine&#x201D;. When a Gentile, however, had actually touched the wine contained in a certain vessel, thus rendering it <italic>yayin nesek</italic> (forbidden wine), and subsequently a Jew poured wine from a cask into the vessel containing the <italic>yayin nesek</italic>, a contact was thus made by the uninterrupted flow of the wine from the cask into the vessel. This contact is termed <italic>nitzok</italic>. Some authorities rule that this contact renders the wine in the cask <italic>yayin nesek</italic>, while other authorities hold that it does not. However, even according to the former authorities, when a Gentile pours wine from a vessel he does not render the wine remaining in it &#x201C;forbidden wine&#x201D;, for the reason that the wine he did pour out of the vessel, though &#x201C;forbidden wine&#x201D;, is not considered <italic>yayin nesek</italic> in the full sense of the term. The mere exerting of energy by a Gentile in connection with the wine, without his actually touching it, renders it &#x201C;forbidden&#x201D; in a limited sense.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the maid must have touched the flowing liquid, even though she was ignorant of its true nature, the wine-vinegar in the cask became forbidden liquor.

<p><italic>A</italic>. Though the majority of thieves are Gentiles, and the talmudic dictum regarding Pumbeditha (A.Z. 70a) does not apply to other places, the use of this wine is permitted nevertheless, for there is no evidence that thieves broke into the cellar. Thus the cellar was found locked, while thieves do not trouble themselves to lock a door after their work is done. Therefore we assume that a member of the household inserted the tap, a common enough occurrence. Each member of the household, though he knows that he himself did not tamper with the cask, is nevertheless permitted to drink the wine, for he may assume that one of the other members of the household inserted the tap.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. We must not be too strict in our ruling when it is uncertain whether wine has been dedicated to an idol. Since there is no indication that the casks which had faucets were tampered with by the thieves, we do not assume that the thieves drew wine from them. Faucets are usually inserted in casks which contain ordinary wine, while sealed casks are used for wine of superior quality. The thieves preferred to insert a faucet in a sealed cask probably in order to draw the superior wine rather than obtain inferior wine from the open casks. Moreover, they did not draw out all the wine even from the sealed cask. There is no reason to suspect, therefore, that they also drew wine from the open casks.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claims that he lent two pounds to B for investment purposes for one year, on condition that B pay him one pound if B&#x2019;s profit from this investment should exceed one pound, or the whole profit in case B&#x2019;s profit be less than one pound. B, however, claims that he was to pay A a uniform interest at the rate of one pound a year, and that it was a usurious transaction, and, therefore, not binding.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A&#x2019;s claim is sustained. Since A could have received a pound a year legally, had he lent the money to B through a Gentile, we must believe the truth of his (A&#x2019;s) present claim.</p>

B gave him the money and took the pledge as security. Subsequently, A told B that he was not entitled to any interest since the pledge belonged to a Jew, and that he had previously lied to him concerning the original owner of the pledge.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B may insist that he believes A&#x2019;s first statement only, even if A is ready to take an oath as to the truth of his second statement. Therefore, if A gave the pledge to B at the time B gave him the money, B may keep the pledge until A pays him the promised interest.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A claims that B lent him money on a pledge, and that when he came to redeem the pledge B exacted interest from him. Since he had contracted the loan directly from B, the latter was not allowed to take any interest on this loan. A, therefore, demands that B pay him back the interest. B, on the other hand, claims that the loan was originally contracted through a Gentile intermediary and that he was entitled, therefore, to the interest.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. It is assumed that a person who might have gained an advantage by following a certain legal procedure, did not fail to follow such procedure. Since B could legally have been entitled to interest on his money had he granted the loan through a Gentile intermediary, we assume that he did grant the loan through such intermediary. Therefore, B is entitled to his interest and is not required to take an oath.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A borrowed ten pounds of charity-money on the following conditions: a) that he pay three pounds per year out of his profits; b) that should his profit be less than three pounds, he would have to pay only half of that profit; and c) in case there be a loss, A would suffer the entire loss himself. For ten years A paid the three pounds per year regularly and thus has paid thirty pounds to the charity-chest. Now, however, being somewhat depleted in finances he is in no position to return the ten pounds. Since it is forbidden to lend charity-money on condition that the lender share in the profits but not in the losses, the thirty pounds paid by A is considered <italic>abak ribbit</italic> (shade of usury). Although A can not collect, by judicial process, the <italic>abak ribbit</italic> he has paid, he ought to be able to retain the ten pounds in exchange for the unlawful interest he has paid. Signed: Hayyim b. Machir.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If one lends money on condition that he share in the profits but not in the losses, the terms of this transaction, being unlawful, are void. We must, therefore, substitute other terms in their place. We must choose one of the following alternatives: a) the transaction is a pure loan bearing no profit; b) the lender is liable for his share of the losses and is entitled to his share of the profits. Since a person lends money with the intention of earning a profit, and such profit constitutes the main purpose of the transaction, we prefer the second alternative. Therefore, we must calculate what percentage of the entire profit (earned by A through the use of the ten pounds) the three pounds per year was expected to form, and, then, charge the charity-chest with the responsibility for the same percentage of the losses. If, during the ten year period, the thirty pounds paid by A exceeded the percentage of the total profit, A is entitled to deduct such excess from the principal; otherwise, he must repay the entire principal.</p>
<p>R. Hayyim b. Machir raised objections to R. Meir&#x2019;s decision. He brought proof to the effect that the transaction ought to be changed into a pure loan bearing no profit, and that A be entitled to retain the ten pounds of the principal against the illegal profit he has paid. He even cited (by number) another Responsum of R. Meir wherein the latter decided that a transaction such as the above be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. (Cf. Cr. 62, Pr. 151; Am. II, 169.) He assured Rabbi Meir, however, that he would follow his decision.</p>
<p>R. Meir replied: I was always of the opinion that the aforesaid transaction ought to be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. But, when your query reached me I had just received the book (Code) of Maimomides, and I decided to &#x201C;ask the Oracle&#x201D; (see what Maimonides says on the subject). When I discovered that Maimonides requires the lender to share in the losses as well as in the profits, I adopted his view. For all his words are based on tradition. Even if this decision be based on reason, I have to bow to his opinion since my inferior reasoning ability could never compare with that of Maimonides who is a profound master in that art. Moreover, I see the wisdom of his view. For a person who lends money to another does so because he hopes to profit thereby. Were he mainly interested in the safety of the principal (as you seem to infer) he would keep the money in a safe place and never lend it to anybody. Were we to ask a lender who had stipulated that he do not share in the losses, whether he would prefer to change his voided agreement into a pure loan transaction bearing no profit, or choose to share in the profits and the losses, he would certainly prefer the latter. Furthermore, when the active partner lends the money against adequate security, the chances of earning a profit are much greater than the chances of losing part of the principal.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A borrowed money against pledges from the charity-trustees, at a stipulated rate of interest. After A had held the money for over half a year, B asked A to lend it to him. B undertook to release A from his obligations to the charity-trustees as to both principal and interest, and was ready to substitute his pledges for those of A. A agreed to this arrangement and gave the money to B.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If B cannot extricate himself from the charity-trustees without paying interest on A&#x2019;s loan, as in case the trustees claim to have lent the money to A through a Gentile, A must pay the required interest to B, since his loan to B constituted a usurious transaction and the court enforces the reimbursement of money collected as usury. On the other hand, if B could extricate himself from the charity-trustees without paying interest on the loan, but in order to do so, he would have to sue the charity-trustees, A should pay B for his efforts on his behalf; otherwise these efforts would constitute <italic>abak ribbit</italic> (a shade of usury).

A claims that B owed him three and three-eighths <italic>marks</italic>, that B gave him valuables to pledge with the charity treasurers for a loan of the same amount (the money of which A was to take in payment of the above debt), that B asked him to pledge with the charity treasurers additional valuables of his own, which he (A) was to lend to B, should B&#x2019;s valuables prove insufficient security for the loan, and that B promised to redeem these valuables. A, therefore, demands that B redeem his pledges. B, while conceding the above, claims that originally A lent him only three <italic>marks</italic>; that the additional three-eighths of a <italic>mark</italic> A is demanding, constitutes the interest on this loan; and that such interest is unlawful usury from Jew to Jew since the loan was made by A directly to him [without a Gentile intermediary].</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B must take an oath that the three-eighths of a <italic>mark</italic> constitutes interest on a loan made directly to him, and thus be free from obligation for this sum. Although by taking this oath B will incriminate himself [since borrowing money on interest is also a sin] such oath will have full legal effect when applied against A. For the testimony of a witness that incriminates the witness himself, is nevertheless acceptable as valid testimony against, or in support of, the litigants (Sanh. 25 a).</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A trustee loaned money belonging to orphans to A on interest, at the rate of one quarter per <italic>mark</italic>. A refused to pay the interest. Moreover, A claimed to have repaid part of the loan, which claim the trustee denied. The inquiring judges decided that even money belonging to orphans can not be loaned to a Jew at a definite rate of interest.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Your decision was correct and the trustee&#x2019;s stipulation of a definite interest was illegal and, therefore, void. However, under the circumstances, the loan is as if made by the Jewish court &#x2014; the natural trustee and protector of all orphans &#x2014; on the usual terms [made when orphans&#x2019; money is loaned]: &#x201C;to share in the profits but not in the losses.&#x201D; Therefore, if A earned profits with the money, he must pay to the trustee, the stipulated quarter per <italic>mark</italic>. If A admits that the money he borrowed belonged to the orphans, but claims to have repaid part of it, the trustee is believed as to the amount he received from A, (in repayment of the loan), and is not required to take an oath since the trustee is a disinterested third party. But if A states his belief that the trustee loaned him his own money, and not the orphans&#x2019; money, the trustee must take an oath as to the amount he received from A in repayment of the loan, though he is not required to take an oath to the effect that the money he loaned belonged to the orphans.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. The Talmud provides that such money be invested with a rich and trustworthy person, one who obeys the laws of the Torah and is careful not to bring upon himself a ban of the Rabbis. It should be invested on condition that the orphans share in the profits but not in the losses (B. M. 70 a). To invest such money in mortgages on houses, fields, or vineyards, is preferable, since money may be lost but land lasts forever. The written contract attesting the transaction, should be deposited with a trustworthy person or with the trustee of the orphans. But, we are not permitted to lend such money on a definite rate of interest.</p>

The former also tutored A&#x2019;s son. In return for both services A paid the young man&#x2019;s living expenses. Is the lending of the aforesaid money considered a legitimate transaction?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If while the arrangement was made with the young man to rehearse the lessons with A&#x2019;s son in return for receiving his sustenance, the stipulation was made that the young man lend money to A, the transaction is considered usurious, even though A would have been content to pay the young man&#x2019;s living expenses in return for his tutoring alone. The fact that the money was not given as an actual loan, since A was not to be responsible for its loss through unavoidable accident, does not materially change the situation, since the Talmud considers the renting of money a usurious transaction (B. M. 69b). But, if it is true, what you write at the end of your letter, that the young man gave A his money as an outright gift so that he is at liberty, should he so desire, never to return the money to the young man, the transaction is a legitimate one.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. A person&#x2019;s admission against his own interests is equivalent to the testimony of a hundred witnesses (Git. 40b). Since the seller admits that the money due from the Gentile really belongs, and has always belonged, to the buyer assignee, the latter is entitled to collect the debt from the Gentile. This procedure, however, does not remove the prohibition against usury, since the interest accruing after the sale still belongs to the seller.</p>

The arbitrators and the witnesses have transgressed the commandment: &#x201C;thou shalt not lay upon him interest (Ex. 22, 24)&#x201D;, while the creditor has violated several negative commandments. A debt in the hands of a Gentile can not be transferred to another by a simple agreement of the three parties concerned. Such a debt may legally be transferred to a third party in the following manner only: The creditor must say to the Gentile debtor and to the sureties: &#x201C;Obligate yourselves to pay to A the debt which you owe me; if you will do so, I shall release you from your obligations toward me.&#x201D; Should the debtor and the sureties agree to the arrangement, only then will the debt be transferred to A.</p>

B paid A the amount due the latter from the Gentile and A said: &#x201C;From now on it is yours.&#x201D; Subsequently, the Gentile failed to redeem the pledge. Is A permitted to recover the pledge and pay B the principal plus the interest accumulated during the time the pledge was in B&#x2019;s possession, or would such payment of interest constitute usury? Moreover, since a Jew does not gain title to a Gentile&#x2019;s pledge (Pesach. 31b), may B refuse to return the pledge to A on the ground that A sold his rights in that pledge to B?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since A did not gain title to the pledge, it is assumed that he surrendered all his rights to the pledge upon handing it to B. Therefore, B became the creditor of the gentile (and not A&#x2019;s creditor) and was entitled to the interest on his loan. Thus B, upon surrendering the pledge to A, has a right to receive from A the principal plus the interest due B from the Gentile; and B has the further right to keep the pledge for himself.</p>

B, therefore, demands twenty-three pounds to be paid to C before he returns the books. A, however, claims that anything paid to C above six <italic>marks</italic> will constitute usury.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B&#x2019;s testimony is accepted without reservation since B is a trustee. According to that testimony, the payment of twenty-three pounds to C would constitute usury.

<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. A and B planned to lend money to a Gentile in partnership at the rate of four <italic>Heller</italic> denarii per pound [per week]. However, A had more money to put in the partnership than B had. They agreed, therefore, that when in the future they would divide the profit, A should first take out of such profit four denarii [per week] per every pound he had invested more than B, and that the remainder should be equally divided between them. When they came to negotiate the loan with the Gentile, however, he asked them that in addition to lending him the money they undertake to feed his horses for a certain period of time. He offered to pay only three <italic>Heller</italic> denarii per pound [per week] interest, but the liberal compensation he offered for feeding his horses induced them to accept his terms. They agreed, therefore, that at the expiration of the designated period the Gentile pay A and B a certain sum of money, which sum represented payment of the principal and the interest, plus remuneration for feeding the horses. Now B claims that out of his share of the profit from feeding the horses he is paying A four denarii per every pound the latter had invested more than he himself had; and that such payment constituted usury.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The above agreement between A and B is valid. No question of usury is involved. A Jew is permitted to pay interest to another Jew for a loan extended to a third party, as long as the first Jew is not responsible for the repayment of the principal.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. A claims that he gave more feed to the horses than B gave.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A should take an oath as to the amount and value of the feed he has given in excess of that of B, and be entitled to collect this difference. If A gave the extra feed at a time the price of feed was lower than it is at present, A must state under oath whether he had intended to lend feed or the price of feed to B, and be entitled to collect accordingly.</p>
<p>3) <italic>Q</italic>. A claims that he bought four measures of feed from B and paid him for it; that when he came to take it, B told him that he had none and advised him to buy some from another person and charge it to him; and that consequently he bought two measures of feed from another person for thirteen schillings. He now demands two measures of feed plus thirteen schillings from B. B avers that since the original transaction was not binding, because mere payment of money does not legally conclude a sale of movables, he now refuses to enter into such a sale, and owes A only the money received from him.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B must give thirteen schillings and two measures of feed to A, or he would incur severe punishment from Heaven. Although the mere payment of money does not conclude a sale, a person who retracts his word incurs severe punishment from Heaven.</p>

Subsequently, the Gentile, a violent man, concocted false charges against A and ordered him to repay both the principal and the interest to B out of his own pocket. The Gentile also told B that A would pay his debt for him. A, therefore, brought the principal and the interest to B. The latter, however, being a religious man, refused to accept the interest lest it be considered usury from Jew to Jew.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B is permitted to accept the interest, for A merely acted as B&#x2019;s deputy. He was never responsible to B for the money. The fact that the Gentile forces A to repay his debt for him, is no concern of B.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. After urinating Leah usually finds blood on her &#x201C;examining rag&#x201D; (<italic>ed</italic>); the Rabbis of Cologne are of the opinion that she is permitted to cohabit with her husband, since the ruling of R. Jose is accepted that a woman who finds blood in her urine is ritually clean (Niddah 59 b).</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Even R. Jose would admit that upon finding blood on her &#x201C;examining rag&#x201D;, after urination, the woman would be ritually unclean. (For R. Jose&#x2019;s opinion is based on the belief that blood found in urine does not come from the interior of the womb, but from a wound or sore; cf. Pr. 630; Mord. <italic>Niddah</italic> 735. That blood on the &#x201C;examining rag&#x201D; after urination however usually comes from the interior of the womb, is universally accepted.) I have often wondered at the compilers of some codes who decide in accordance with the view of R. Jose, yet fail to make the above distinction.</p>

<p>We have carefully investigated and found that this woman has a wound in her womb; for every time she urinates she suffers severe pain. Occasionally, but not always, she finds blood in her urine; but no blood is found immediately after urination, neither upon wiping herself nor on the &#x201C;examining rag&#x201D;. I, therefore, agree with you that this woman is permitted to cohabit with her husband, for, when a woman says she has a wound in her womb from which the blood exudes, she is to be believed.</p>

<p>L has a wart in her vagina which bleeds during copulation and even when touched by the &#x201C;examining rag&#x201D;. I am inclined to believe that L is ritually clean since we assume that her blood comes from the wart and not from the interior of the womb. During her regular period (of menstruation), if she definitely feels that the blood comes from the wart, she is ritually clean; otherwise she is unclean. At other times she is ritually clean even when she does not definitely feel that the blood comes from the wart. She can recognize the menses by a greater flow of blood than that which usually comes from the wart. At her menstruation period she must count the same number of days as hitherto. Moreover, knowing exactly where the wart is situated, she should be able to manipulate the &#x201C;examining rag&#x201D; in such a way as to discover whether there be present any menstrual blood.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A lived normally with his wife L for some time. Later, however, L detected discharges of blood during copulation on three occasions. Should L &#x201C;examine herself&#x201D; (Niddah 66a, with a lead tube, in order to discover whether the blood flows from the interior of the womb or from the walls of the vagina) or must A divorce her immediately? In case of divorce, is L entitled to her <italic>ketubah?</italic></p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Rashi and Ri hold opposite views on this subject. We are not at liberty to disregard Rashi&#x2019;s view and, therefore, can not permit A to live with L even if an &#x201C;examination&#x201D; will produce favorable results. However, we must make the following distinction: If the three acts of copulation during which blood</p>
<p>was detected were consecutive, A must divorce L forthwith; but, if they were not consecutive and between each act there were other acts during which no trace of blood was detected, A is permitted to live with L. If the copulations during which blood was detected, occurred on specific dates, or at regular intervals, A must refrain from copulation on such dates. Moreover, if A is not anxious to remarry, and is willing to allow L to live away from him in another district and to deal with her through an intermediary or only in the presence of a third party, he does not have to divorce her. In case of divorce, however, L is entitled to the <italic>Ikkar-ketubah</italic> and to her dowry, but she cannot collect the additional jointure, since some authorities are of the opinion that under the circumstances she is not entitled to the additional jointure.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. B betrothed his daughter C to his nephew D, the son of B&#x2019;s brother, A, while C and D were still minors. D married C while she was still a minor, and entrusted his dowry, into the hands of his father-in-law, B, as a loan. After the first night, blood was found on the bridal sheet in spite of the fact that D did not yet cohabit with his wife, C. The fact was then discovered that C dripped with blood whenever she micturated or defecated. D, who kept away from his wife for a half year, was advised to cohabit with her on the ground that he thus might cure her. D did so and C&#x2019;s blood flowed profusely. D, therefore, sent C back to her father. D&#x2019;s mother claimed that C had this illness before she was betrothed to D; that long before C&#x2019;s marriage she once found C soaked in blood; that D&#x2019;s marriage to her was, therefore, contracted in error; and that C was therefore not entitled to her <italic>ketubah</italic>. B, however, claimed that it was D&#x2019;s misfortune that he could not cohabit with C, and, therefore, B demanded C&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. As soon as a person marries a woman, even if he does not cohabit with her, she is entitled to her <italic>ketubah</italic>. Therefore, D must pay C her <italic>ketubah</italic> unless he can conclusively prove that C was dripping blood before her bethrothal.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Are the &#x201C;days of purity&#x201D; [the days between the seventh and the fortieth day after the birth of a son, and between the fourteenth and the eightieth day after the birth of a daughter during which a flow of blood does not render the woman unfit to cohabit with her husband] still in effect? Alfasi rules that the &#x201C;days of purity&#x201D; are not in effect at present.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. I have not at hand Alfasi on the laws of <italic>Niddah</italic>, but I once examined carefully the statement of Alfasi, referred to, and found that he did not mean to convey your meaning at all; for there is no doubt that the &#x201C;days of purity&#x201D; are still in effect.</p>
<p>R. Meir adds: When I studied under my teachers in France, my father asked my teacher whether the &#x201C;days of purity&#x201D; were still in effect. My teacher was surprised that this should be doubted at all, since no opinion to the contrary is quoted in the Talmud. He asked me so to inform my father. But, when I subsequently returned to this kingdom I was told that Alfasi had decided that the days of purity were no longer in effect. A closer examination of the text of Alfasi, however, did not bear this out. Therefore, if one wants to be stringent, he may be stringent; but the one who chooses to be lenient, may do so without compunction.</p>

<p>A woman is permitted to cohabit with her husband immediately after her immersion in the ritual bath, even if such immersion took place in the daytime [of the eighth day]. However, R.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. I have heard that you permit a woman to attend the bath-house for further lavation, after her required immersion in a ritual bath.</p>

For the original prohibition against washing in ordinary water after immersion in a ritual bath, was directed only against persons preparing themselves for sacred duties; while a woman prepares herself for a secular purpose. My teacher R. Isaak of Vienna, was wont to prohibit such practice; nevertheless, when I once presented my point of view discussing the matter at length in his presence, he did not contradict me. I also heard from young men from Mantua, that when he (?) inquired about the matter from Rabbi Isaiah of Burgundy [of Trani], the latter also permitted the practice.</p>

<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. Water was drawn with a leaking vessel from a ritual bath until less than forty <italic>seah</italic> remained in it. The vessel had a hole, the size of a finger, in its side, immediately adjacent to the bottom. There is no doubt, therefore, that at least three <italic>lugin</italic> of water leaked back from the vessel into the bath, thus rendering the bath unfit for ritual purposes. Therefore, no inflow of fresh water could ever purify it for ritual purposes. The obvious solution would be completely to drain the bath until less than three <italic>lugin</italic> of water remain therein. But the natural inflow of fresh water is so intense that the bath can not be so drained.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. I should prefer to have the bath completely drained and thus be spared the trouble of discovering legal grounds to declare the bath fit for ritual purposes. Since, however, that is impossible, I declare that the bath is ritually pure for two reasons: a) since the hole in the vessel is immediately adjacent to the bottom so that the vessel can not retain any water, it is legally not considered a vessel. Therefore, the water dripping therefrom is not considered <italic>maim sheubim</italic> (drawn water) and does not render the bath unfit for ritual purposes. b) This ritual bath, being a natural spring, does not become unfit by the admixture of <italic>maim sheubim</italic>.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. Does water scooped up in a winnowing shovel, (that has a rim on three sides but is open on the fourth side) and poured back into the ritual bath render the bath unfit for ritual purposes?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since such shovel can not retain water, it is not considered a vessel and the water scooped up therein is not considered <italic>maim sheubim</italic>.</p>

I have inquired and have become convinced that no peace was possible between R. Samson and his wife unless this vow is dissolved. I for my part, therefore, fully consent to its dissolution and agree that the others do likewise. Moreover, since the dissolution of R. Samson&#x2019;s vow is a meritorious act that would reestablish domestic tranquility, his vow may be dissolved without our consent. The correct procedure would be first to annul the condition that a unanimous consent of the three Rabbis be required &#x2014; for this condition in itself constitutes a vow and lends itself to the same manner of dissolution as other vows &#x2014; and finally to dissolve the vow itself.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. The burghers forced some Jews to take an oath on the Scroll of the Law that they would not clip the coins. While taking the oath the Jews made mental reservations, to their verbal statements, which they believed invalidated the oath. They proceeded, therefore, to clip the coins.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Whether or not one has taken an oath not to clip coins, the doing so is a serious crime, the perpetrators of which deserve severe punishment. Clipping coins is tantamount to stealing and robbing, and robbing Gentiles is a crime. Furthermore, such an act creates a public nuisance as it may result in causing great injury to other Jews innocently passing on these coins. It may even cause widespread disaster, and has already led to a great deal of bloodshed. Thus, clipping coins brought about the destruction of our brethren in France and Britain. In addition to committing a basic crime, these Jews broke their solemn oath to the burghers. Mental reservations do not invalidate an oath occasioned by legal circumstances. The talmudic ruling (Ned. 28a) that a person may invalidate his oath to extortionists and murderers by mental reservations, does not apply in this case; for, while extortionists and murderers, by administering an oath, strive to bolster their criminal purposes, it is legal and proper for a king or civil authority to forbid the clipping of coins. Therefore, their oath to the burghers was valid despite their mental reservations. Moreover, when the Gentiles will learn that the Jews clipped coins despite their oath &#x2014; and they are bound to discover it sooner or later &#x2014; they will suspect the Jews of wilfully breaking their oath. Should the latter inform the Gentiles that they disregarded their oath because of mental reservations, the consequences might be still more serious; for Gentiles will never again believe a Jew under oath. Therefore, if your authority and my authority carry enough weight, these Jews should be properly flogged.</p>

I have often protested most vigorously against it, but they would not heed me. I have often repeated that on account of such practices family fortunes have been ruined and investments lost, but I have been unable to abate these practices; for those who indulge in them state that they rely on great authority, on R. Tam, who permitted such practices on the ground that the Gentiles of today were not idolators. Nowadays the Gentiles swear by their sacred objects but do not consider the objects themselves to be deities. Though they appeal to Heaven and mean Jesus, they do not expressly mention his name. [Regarding the prohibition involved, see Sanh. 43b]. Moreover, since these Jews do not heed outright prohibitions, how can one expect them to abstain from practices that some authorities permit? However, the person who reported to you that I sanction such practices, did not speak the truth; for whenever a difference of opinion exists between our great authorities I follow the strict opinion, except when the lenient ruling has been widely accepted as an ancient custom.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Why do we, nowadays, partake of secular festivity-meals and secular wedding-feast meals (such as at the wedding of a priest to a daughter of an Israelite, or of a daughter of a scholar to a commoner) in view of the fact that the Talmud explicitly states (B. Pesah. 49a): &#x201C;A scholar may not partake of any but religious festivity-meals?&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. We recite, at such meals, hymns of praise and thanksgiving to the Lord and thus convert them into religious feasts.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. B swore to leave all his disputes with A, to C and D for arbitration. Subsequently, B vilified A&#x2019;s father calling him shameful names, to which A retorted: &#x201C;not my father, but your father&#x201D;. B became enraged at the insult to his father who had been a scholar and a sage. Both fathers were dead at the time. Now B demands that A be duly punished for vilifying a scholar after his death.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. We have no right to adjudicate fines, but a court is permitted to take emergency measures whenever necessary. However, if A will take an oath to the effect that he did not fully understand the charge B had made against his father but automatically replied, &#x201C;your father&#x201D;, he will be free from obligation. Moreover, B must leave this dispute also to C and D for arbitration. He can not press this charge separately without transgressing his oath. On the other hand, since people customarily and automatically reply &#x201C;your father&#x201D; whenever someone vilifies their father, B deserves greater punishment than A since he was the first to use vile language. In any event, both A and B should appear before a scholar seeking atonement for their sin of having vilified the dead.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A rich man called the son of a worthy and scholarly family &#x201C;bastard, son of bastards&#x201D;. What should be his punishment?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The Talmud prescribes thirty-nine lashes, and the judges may punish him more severely, if he makes a practice of offending people. The punishment should also depend on the high qualifications of the man and the family insulted. But for his own salvation, he should fast, chastise himself, give charity to the poor, and ask the Lord for mercy and forgiveness; for he has offended scholars in their graves which is, indeed, a serious sin.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. If L&#x2019;s contention were supported by witnesses, the community would have to punish A by flagellation or imposition of a fine, in accordance with the status of the individuals involved. But, since there are no witnesses, and A denies her charge, no oath is to be imposed on A. Similarly, if A&#x2019;s contention were supported by witnesses, or if L admitted his charge, she would have to visit the grave of the dead person she had vilified, and in the presence of ten Jews, ask forgiveness from the dead. But, since there are no witnesses, and each one denies the other&#x2019;s charge, they are free from obligation. In order to pacify L and A, however, the community may pronounce a solemn curse in the synagogue, such curse to fall on A or L if they are not telling the truth. This procedure should force them to admit the truth.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A promised to give two <italic>marks</italic> for a holy cause should he cohabit with his wife, within the year. He did cohabit with her within that time. If such promise of a gift were made by an individual, even had such money been actually delivered to the donee, it would be considered an <italic>asmakhta</italic> and would be void. Therefore, this conditional promise for a holy cause should also be void, for, although a mere verbal promise for a holy cause is as valid as an actual delivery (of money and valuables) to a private person, it has no greater validity than such delivery; and any transaction classified as an <italic>asmakhta</italic> is invalid even if the money and valuables are actually delivered. Although a conditional promise classified as <italic>asmakhta</italic>, if accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic> and made before an authoritative court, is valid, its validity stems from the powers of confiscation inherent in the authoritative court, but not from an act of the promisor.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A must pay two <italic>marks</italic> to the holy cause. A mere verbal promise to a holy cause is as binding as a similar promise to an individual accompanied by any manner of conveyance that serves to validate such promise. Since a conditional promise classified as <italic>asmakhta</italic> is valid if accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic> and made before an authoritative court, a mere promise of this kind made to charity or to a holy cause is binding, even though the promise was not made before an authoritative court. The validity of a conditional promise made before an authoritative court does not stem from the court&#x2019;s power of confiscation, otherwise no <italic>kinyan</italic> would have been required. Moreover, the power of confiscation by a Jewish court is invoked only for the furtherance of proper conduct in accordance with Jewish principles (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05E4;&#x05D2;&#x05D3;&#x05E8; &#x05DE;&#x05DC;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;</span>) but not for the sake of validating private transactions.</p>

Should one of the members of the community, however, give a fixed sum of money to the charity-chest in full payment of his share of the charity burden, he would thus become a disinterested witness in this case, and his testimony together with that of the other witness would impose upon L the obligation of paying one pound to the charity-chest.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. After A&#x2019;s death, his widow and her mother revealed that A had left a Scroll of the Law and his large, good prayer-book to charity. They suggested that the community should choose one of them on the following terms: if they choose the Scroll they must undertake to memorialize A&#x2019;s soul together with the souls of the other departed; but if they choose the prayer-book they must undertake to use it constantly for ten years [that the <italic>Hazzan</italic> use it in conducting the prayers of the congregation]. The community chose the prayer-book. But, the widow and her mother, then, asserted that they had agreed to deliver the prayer-book on condition that it be used for ten years to the exclusion of all other prayer-books. At court the representative of the community stated that the community would be ready to accept the prayer-book on the original terms, while the widow&#x2019;s representative denied ever having offered the prayer-book to the community. The community representative retorted that such offer was made in the presence of many witnesses. Accordingly a solemn ban was pronounced against anyone who had heard the widow make the offer and would not appear at court to offer testimony. Some members of the community, then, testified that the widow offered the prayer-book to the community on condition that it be used for ten years. Others testified that they heard the widow&#x2019;s mother make such offer but did not hear it from the widow herself. Some testified that they heard the widow&#x2019;s mother stipulate the term &#x201C;exclusively&#x201D;, while others heard no exclusive stipulation.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the prayer-book has allegedly been offered to the community, the members of the community, as interested parties, are considered disqualified witnesses. Therefore, in the absence of qualified witnesses, if the widow will take an oath to the effect that she had never offered the prayer-book, to the community, she will be free from obligation.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. We, the undersigned, were chosen as examiners and recorders of the claims of A and the widow L. Consequently, witnesses have testified before us: a) that when A was ill he asked his wife, R, to agree to an arrangement that would bring solace to their souls; b) that A and R, therefore, made a legally binding arrangement in their presence, to the effect that if A died first R would give three <italic>marks</italic> and A&#x2019;s clothes to a charity stipulated by him; and if R died first A would give six <italic>marks</italic> and R&#x2019;s clothes to a charity stipulated by her; and c) that subsequently A recovered from his illness, but R became critically ill and died of her illness. R&#x2019;s mother, L, came before us and claimed that, before her death, R appointed her (L) trustee of the six <italic>marks</italic> and the clothes, and that she asked her to distribute the same to any charity she saw fit. L, therefore, demanded the six <italic>marks</italic> and R&#x2019;s clothes from A. A on the other hand, claimed that he asked his wife before her death why she had not stipulated the recipients of this charity, and in reply she authorized him to spend two <italic>marks</italic> on the cemetery, either for the purpose of constructing a wall or for obtaining sand; to give half a <italic>mark</italic> for the sick, and to give the rest to R&#x2019;s needy relatives. Neither L nor A have any witnesses to support their assertions. Regarding the garments demanded by L, A claimed that L had already taken away all of R&#x2019;s clothes with the exception of one cloak. A demanded that L return to him his wife&#x2019;s seven gold rings, the two pieces of silver jewelry, the two Cologne gulden, and the money that was in R&#x2019;s pocket, which L had taken. L averred that she had returned to A everything that belonged to him. L further demanded that A pay her the expenses she incurred in transporting her daughter&#x2019;s body to another place for burial. A averred that he had paid for the casket and the shrouds; that L had transported R&#x2019;s body without his knowledge and consent; that he had intended to bury her in our town since there was a cemetery in our town; and that L had incurred unnecessary expenses in having R&#x2019;s relatives accompany the body to the place of burial. L, on the other hand, claimed that A had known of her intentions to transport her daughter to another town for burial, that A had consented to it, and that she could prove the truth of these contentions through the testimony of A&#x2019;s tutor, should the latter be forced to testify by a <italic>herem</italic>. A&#x2019;s tutor was summoned before us and testified to the following facts: A told him that he, A, would have accompanied his wife&#x2019;s body to the place of burial were he able to leave the house; he asked the tutor whether he was willing to take his place; the tutor agreed and accompanied the hearse as instructed. Three days after the claims in question were placed before us, L further claimed that A had been at odds with her daughter and, therefore, the latter did not entrust to him the charity money, and preferred that L distribute it. A denied this claim asserting that there was never any enmity between him and his wife, and that, on the contrary, she became very affectionate toward him during her illness and tried to show this affection in many ways. L also claimed that she had already distributed R&#x2019;s clothes in accordance with the latter&#x2019;s instructions; while A claimed to have warned L not to give anything away without his consent. A discovered some of the garments distributed by L in the hands of the recipients. Please explain in detail who is to be entrusted with the distribution of the charity money, and please write your answer on the reverse side of this parchment. Signed: Samuel b. Eliezer haKohen; Kalonymus b. Asher; Nahman b. Nathan.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If L claims that A was present when her daughter appointed her the distributor of the money and the clothes, A must take cognizance of her claims and must take an oath denying such claims. After taking such an oath, A will have to give to charity in the presence of witnesses the six <italic>marks</italic> and the clothes still in his possession. But, if L admits that A was not present at the time she was thus appointed distributor of the money and the clothes, A is under no obligation to L and must proceed to give them to charity in the presence of witnesses. L., on the other hand, must take an oath to the effect that she did not take anything belonging to A, that she has distributed R&#x2019;s clothes in accordance with the latter&#x2019;s instructions, and be free from obligation. As to the expenses of R&#x2019;s funeral, if some of R&#x2019;s relatives, or some of A&#x2019;s relatives, had been transported and buried in the cemetery to which R&#x2019;s body was transported, A was under obligation to bury R in that cemetery, since a husband is obliged to bury his wife with all the honor and dignity customary in her family, or in his family, whichever be the greater. Therefore, A must pay L the expenses she incurred in the burial of her daughter, and must also repay all loans extended to L for that purpose. Moreover, even if no relatives of A or R were ever buried in this cemetery, since A sent his tutor to participate in the funeral, he thus gave his consent to the proceedings and must pay the expenses thereof. The amount of such expenses are to be attested to by L under oath. However, A is responsible only for the expenses strictly necessary for the funeral, but not for any unnecessary extravagances.</p>

Must the fine-money be equally divided between the two synagogues, or must it be distributed in proportion to their respective memberships?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The distribution of charity and fine-money is governed either by custom or by agreement on the part of the community (members). However, if no custom exists in your town and the community can come to no agreement, the money should be distributed in proportion to the number of charity recipients belonging to each synagogue; for A and B were ordered by the community to pay to charity, and all the poor of the town have an equal claim to the charity of that town. A distinction is drawn in Jewish law between the poor related to the donor and the poor of the town, between the poor of the donor&#x2019;s town and those of another town. But we find no distinction drawn between the poor of the donor&#x2019;s synagogue and those of another synagogue in the same town.</p>

But, should one resident dissent, and insist on giving his &#x201C;tithe&#x201D; (charity money) to his indigent relatives instead of to the non-resident poor, the other members of the community would have no right to interfere with him.</p>

It is the accepted law that children are obligated to support their widowed mother only out of the possessions they inherited from their father, but not out of their own possessions. However, children of means may be forced to support their mother as an act of charity [since a Jew may be forced to give charity to the poor]. Therefore, any son who would himself be thrown upon charity were he forced to support his mother, can not be forced to do so. But those sons who have means should support their mother in proportion to their wealth. These sons, however, cannot be forced to support their mother out of their own money, but can do so out of the money they are usually obliged to give to charity, although they would thus incur the curse of the Rabbis who say: &#x201C;Cursed be he who feeds his father out of the poor man&#x2019;s tithe&#x201D; Kid. 32a.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. This is undoubtedly prohibited. But since the lending of charity-funds at a definite rate of interest became such a widespread custom throughout the Kingdom that the prohibition of the practice would not be heeded even if the law became known we refrain from publicising this prohibition.

<p><italic>A</italic>. Lending charity-funds on condition that the lender share in the profits but not in the losses, is forbidden. The Rabbis who said (B. M. 70a) that a person lending money on such a condition is called &#x201C;wicked&#x201D; made no distinction between rich and poor. Since a poor person is not permitted to lend his money on condition that he share in the profits but not in the losses, we are not permitted to do so for him.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. What is the legal basis for permitting the lending of charity-funds upon a definite rate of interest?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Perhaps some persons have mistakenly ruled that charity-funds are in the same category as Temple-funds. However, this is incorrect, for the Talmud considers charity-funds as money belonging to &#x201C;thy brother&#x201D; and, therefore, must be included in the commandment: &#x201C;unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest (Deut. 23,21)&#x201D;.

<p>Those who lend charity-funds upon a definite rate of interest are doing an improper thing, for charity-funds are included in the commandment: &#x201C;unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest (Deut. 23,21).&#x201D; However, such funds may be lent on condition that the profits but not the losses be shared.</p>

<h1><bold>205</bold></h1>
<p>A person is not permitted to lend charity-funds on interest, and it makes no difference whether or not the recipients of the funds are designated by name or the amounts they are to receive, determined (cf. B. K. 93a end). The poor are included in the term &#x201C;thy brother&#x201D; used in the law which prohibits the charging of interest. I lend out the charity funds in my possession for investment purposes only, to share equally in the profits and the losses; but I do not lend these funds on interest.</p>
<p>R.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A&#x2019;s son was an eight-month&#x2019;s baby and was very weak when it was born. A appointed B as his <italic>Mohel</italic> (circumciser) and informed him that the circumcision was to take place a month after birth, at which time the child would be proven to be viable. Subsequently A informed B that the date of circumcision would be postponed until such time as the child would be strong enough to undergo the operation. B left the city on community business and returned one day before the end of the month. Meanwhile, however, A had decided to circumcise his son immediately after he would be a month old, and, fearing that B might not return on time, he engaged an out-of-town <italic>Mohel</italic> promising him that the <italic>Mitzvah</italic> will be his even though B would return before the ceremony. B now demands that he be permitted to perform the rite. In general, may a father who has already appointed someone as a <italic>Mohel</italic> or <italic>Baal Berith</italic> (the one who holds the child during the rite), change his mind and give the honor to someone else? Please let us know the laws governing these situations since disputes often arise regarding them.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the child was not circumcised yet, B should perform the rite of circumcision since he was promised the <italic>Mitzvah</italic> originally. If the circumcision, however, had already taken place, B would have no claim, since no question of money is involved.</p>

Subsequently the woman appeared and offered to redeem the heifer. A agreed to the transaction, but, before the woman had the opportunity of producing the money, the heifer gave birth to a firstling. Is the calf a consecrated firstling (which can not be sold to a Gentile)?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. When the robbers took the cow away from its owner, he abandoned all hope of recovery. Therefore, when A bought it he acquired clear title thereto because of this abandonment of hope and of the change of domain. The subsequent consent by A to allow the original owner to redeem the cow, did not transfer the title to the owner.

<p><italic>A</italic>. 1. All these people were guilty of various sins: a) They permitted the birth of a public nuisance. b) They perverted the will of the Lord who intended His 24 gifts to the priesthood to be a boon to them and not a nuisance. c) They have been guilty of despising consecrated objects. d) They derived satisfaction from giving a priests&#x2019; gift to a particular <italic>Kohen</italic>.

It is true that in the Mishnah (<italic>Hallah</italic> 2,4.) R. Eliezer decides that cakes taken from different pieces of dough may be joined for the purpose of taking <italic>Hallah</italic> by putting them in one basket. But this law of R. Eliezer is only a restrictive measure in order to require the taking of <italic>Hallah</italic> from small pieces of dough (by putting them together in a basket), which are, by themselves, too small to necessitate the taking of <italic>Hallah</italic> from them. But R. Eliezer never meant his law to be a palliative measure.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Are the women among the group of forced converts from Rockenhausen who escaped from their captors, permitted to resume their marital relations with their husbands?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Nowadays that the Gentiles are all powerful, a Jewish woman who was held captive by them, even though only for the purpose of extortion, is not permitted to live with her husband (Ket. 27b). But, since in this case many Jews were held captive together, they are now able to testify which women were not violated by their captors; such women who can furnish this testimony, even by a single witness and even by a woman witness, are permitted to resume their marital relations with their husbands. The fact that the captives did not give their lives for their religion does not disqualify them as witnesses. Although a Jew is enjoined to choose death rather than be forced to worship idols, should he violate this law he would not become disqualified as a witness though he would be guilty of having committed a sin. Moreover, according to the account given by the captives, they never actually embraced Christianity, but merely listened without comment to the priest&#x2019;s recitation of his senseless ritual in the presence of the Gentiles. Thus, the captives never committed a sin; for a Jew is not enjoined to choose death rather than allow the Christians to deceive themselves into believing that they have converted him.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, of priestly lineage, saw his wife L go to a secluded place with a certain young man. They stayed there only for a short time, for L&#x2019;s mother walked toward them with a lighted candle. On another occasion, while lying in bed late at night, A heard, on the other side of the wall, the heavy breathing of his wife and the young man as they were arduously embracing each other, which to him was clearly indicative of consummated sexual intercourse. The same incident was repeated on another night. On these occasions L was late coming to bed. Next morning, however, when A rebuked L for her lewd conduct, she protested vigorously. Nevertheless A was convinced that his wife commited adultery and was, therefore, forbidden to him. A had always loved and catered to L, but she had never returned that love, and had never submitted to him willingly.</p>
<p>Rabbi Hezekiah b. Jacob, to whom the question was first submitted, ruled that L be forbidden to A.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. One judge is not at liberty to permit what another has prohibited. Were I present at the time when Rabbi Hezekiah received the query, I would have argued the case with him. A woman is not forbidden to her husband unless either: a) the husband is jealous of a certain man, and warns her against private meetings with this man, and the wife disregards this warning in the presence of witnesses; or b) they actually be found in a position indicative of fornication. But, heavy breathing itself is no indication that illicit sexual intercourse took place. Therefore, I shall wait till Rabbi Hezekiah recuperates from his illness, whereupon I shall discuss this matter with him.</p>

Since, however, A had no witnesses to corroborate him, nor did he witness any actual intimate relations between the Gentile and his wife, are we nevertheless to give credence to his words to the extent that we should no longer require him to support her?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Your question regarding the wife&#x2019;s sustenance indicates that you are convinced that she is forbidden to her husband. This is not so, however, for a woman is not forbidden to her husband unless either: a) he is jealous of a particular man, warns her against private meetings with him, and witnesses testify that subsequent to the warning she secluded herself with that man; or b) the husband finds his wife with another man in a compromising position. In any event, even if the husband maintains that he saw her with the Gentile in a compromising position, as long as his statement is not supported by witnesses, she is not to be deprived of her right to sustenance and to her <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>

Similarly, if a husband says he had seen his wife have sexual relations with another man, and there are no witnesses to corroborate his statement, his personal statement does not deprive her of her right to the <italic>ketubah</italic>.

Thus, the Rabbis are intent upon breaking up the marriage of a man to a woman pregnant by another. Would, then, Rabbenu Gershom protect such a marriage by his <italic>takkanah</italic>&#x0021; I am even inclined to the opinion that the betrothal itself was invalid since the bridegroom was ignorant of facts, the knowledge of which would have prevented him from marrying L.

<h1><bold>246</bold></h1>
<p>R. Isaac left his wife Sarah in the month of <italic>Adar</italic> of the year 5031 (1271), and travelled to a distant place in search of sustenance for his family. Next year he learned that his wife had played the harlot and had thus become pregnant. He returned home, and in the month of <italic>Ab</italic> of the year 5032 (1272) he appeared before us and asked us to investigate his wife&#x2019;s conduct during his absence, since she bore a child in the month of Adar of the same year (1272), twelve months after he had left her. Sarah asserted, however, that she was pregnant when her husband left her. Therefore we, the undersigned, wrote to R. Shealtiel and his two sons, who lived in the same village with Sarah, and they testified in writing that Sarah bore a child twelve months after R. Isaac left her. The signatures and seals of the deponents have been attested to by reliable witnesses. Then, a person appeared before us because of the ban (proclaimed against all those who knew anything relating to this case and did not appear as witnesses) and testified that on the evening of <italic>Shabuot</italic> of the previous year (1271) he went to Sarah&#x2019;s home in order to recite the <italic>kiddush</italic> in her presence, and found Gentiles, loafers, who caroused with her, caressed and embraced her. We concluded, therefore, that she must have become pregnant at that time. Other persons testified to have seen her on <italic>Purim</italic> of this year (1272) in the last stages of pregnancy. On previous occasions, however, in the month of <italic>Elul</italic>, she violently protested that she was not pregnant, and cursed and abused those who had said to her that she was pregnant. Moreover, before the evil report reached the town, Sarah&#x2019;s father appeared before us and asked us to allow him to put his daughter to death by drowning her. When asked for his reasons, he stated that a daughter of his (meaning Sarah) was an incorrigible harlot, who bore a bastard daughter by a Gentile and then killed her child. When asked whether he tried other means of controlling her, he answered that whenever he reproved her she threatened to apostatize altogether and pleaded that she was not the first woman who ever sinned. She had left the house on a number of occasions but was persuaded to return by the entreaties of her mother. The father feared lest she turn to evil and, therefore, asked for permission to kill her. However, we did not permit him to carry out his design. We sent the testimony to Rothenburg to the great luminary, Rabbi Meir. Since the Rabbis of Erfurt who are near us, and those of W&#x00FC;rzburg, who are far from us, as well as Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, all agree to allow R. Isaac to divorce Sarah even against her will, the divorce has been given in our presence. Signed: Moses Azriel b. Eleazar hadarshan, Eleazar b. Yehiel, Ephraim b. Joel.</p>
<p>R. Meir&#x2019;s opinion was as follows:</p>
<p>The testimony of R. Shealtiel and his sons is of no consequence for two reasons. a) They are related to each other; their testimony is that of a single witness, and, therefore, insufficient. b) The foetus could have lingered in the mother&#x2019;s womb for twelve months (cf. Yeb. 80b). Sarah&#x2019;s giving birth to a child twelve months after her husband left her, is, therefore, no proof of her depravity. The testimony of the other witness regarding Sarah&#x2019;s indecent behavior on the evening of <italic>Shabuot</italic>, being the testimony of a single witness, does not deprive Sarah of her right to her <italic>ketubah</italic>. If R. Isaac believes the aforementioned witness or if he takes the word of his wife&#x2019;s own father, he must divorce Sarah even against her will. If she renders it impossible for him to divorce her, he may marry another woman without divorcing Sarah as a warning to all indecent and depraved women. But he must pay Sarah her <italic>ketubah</italic>. However, if Sarah admits her guilt, or acknowledges the truth of the testimony regarding her indecent conduct on the evening of <italic>Shabuot</italic>, or if she cannot satisfactorily explain why she denied her being pregnant in the month of <italic>Elul</italic> of the previous year, or answer all other questions regarding her conduct, she loses her right to her <italic>ketubah</italic> and is entitled only to whatever is left of the valuables she had brought with her upon her marriage.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, of priestly lineage, married a woman within three months [of the death of her husband]. The authorities would have forced A to divorce her &#x2014; even though he was of priestly lineage and would not be able to remarry her once he divorced her &#x2014; had he not postponed asking them about the matter till long after the three months had expired and after it had become definitely certain that she had not been pregnant by her former husband. What is your opinion on this subject?</p> 
<p><italic>A</italic>. The ban that is pronounced against a person who marries a widow within three months of her husband&#x2019;s death, is not a punitive measure, but is a means of forcing such a person to divorce her in order that he should not live with her within the three months of her former husband&#x2019;s death [so that the child born seven, eight, or nine, months later would not be of doubtful parentage]. After the three months have passed, therefore, there is no longer any reason for pronouncing the ban, and persons already married prior to the expiration of that period may be permitted to continue their married life undisturbed. The same rule applies to a person who married a nursing widow before her child was twenty-four months old. If no action was taken against him before the expiration of the twenty-four months, none should be taken against him after the expiration of that period. At the same time we make no distinction between a person who married a nursing widow because he was ignorant of the transgression involved, and the person who did so fully aware that he was doing wrong, since forcing a person to divorce his wife whom he married in a forbidden period, as referred to above, is not a punitive measure.</p>

<h1><bold>248</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. How long should a nursing widow wait until she can remarry?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The accepted law is that she must wait 24 moon-months (from the day the child is born), i. e. months of alternating length of 29 and 30 days. If one of the years is a leap year, she must wait 25 such months. However, were I not afraid to differ with the decisions of my teachers, I would require her to wait 24 full months of 30 days each, or 720 days, and in a leap year 25 moon-months of alternating length, in order to be sure to comply with all possible interpretations of the opinions of the authorities of the Talmud.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, of priestly lineage, married a nursing widow, Leah. Before the marriage took place, Leah, following the advice of Rabbi Jacob (of Cracow), gave her infant to a wet-nurse who made a vow <italic>Al Daat Rabbim</italic> (the interpretation of said vow to lodge with an undetermined number of people, and, therefore, incapable of annulment) not to resign her position till the infant be of age to be weaned (two years). Many have disputed the efficacy of this procedure, and gave their opinions that A must divorce Leah. Rabbi Jacob pleaded that A be not required to divorce Leah since A, being of priestly lineage, would not be able to remarry her after the two year period of nursing be over.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A person who married a nursing widow must divorce her, even though he was of priestly lineage and consequently could not remarry her, once he divorced her. The wet-nurse&#x2019;s vow is of no avail since her husband could annul it even though it was made <italic>Al Daat Rabbim</italic>.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A went to a village and expected to return the same day. He did not return, and on that day a murdered man was found in the nearby forest. Although the body was unrecognizable as it had been mutilated by dogs, it was identified as A&#x2019;s body for the following reasons: (a) People said that a Jew was murdered; (b) the garments on the dead body were recognized as belonging to A; (c) A&#x2019;s wife identified a mole on the dead body as the one her husband had. May A&#x2019;s wife remarry?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Neither a general rumor, nor the finding of one&#x2019;s garments on a dead body, are sufficient to establish the death of an individual. But a woman is believed when she identifies her husband&#x2019;s body through a mole. A&#x2019;s wife may, therefore, remarry.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. L&#x2019;s husband disappeared. Her relatives sent inquiries to the surrounding towns in an effort to locate him. Meanwhile a Gentile came to the Jews of a neighboring town, and asked them why they did not fetch the body of the murdered Jew from T (the town where L&#x2019;s husband had lived) that was lying in place X. The Gentile added that for one pound he would himself convey the body in his wagon to T. Since the Gentile mentioned money, we were doubtful whether his statement should be admitted in evidence.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. I have considered the above case from all angles, and find no reason why L should not be permitted to remarry. The fact that the Gentile mentioned money did not weaken his testimony, but rather strengthened it; for, not only did he make a report in his innocence, he even offered to prove the truth of it. Therefore, if no other Jew is missing from T, L should be permitted to remarry. Moreover, I have seen the letter of R. Jacob b. Mordecai, bearing the signature of Rabbi Eliezer, which stated that a certain Gentile told a Jew that he killed L&#x2019;s husband. This statement by the murderer is to be admitted in evidence; and should, in itself, serve as a basis for permitting L to remarry.</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir adds: I am not worthy to be relied upon, unless my teacher Rabbi Eliezer, you yourselves, and the other teachers agree with me. Otherwise, my opinion is void.</p>

One Jew is willing to testify that the young man is dead since he searched for his body together with experienced fishermen who assured him that no one could come out alive under the circumstances. May we permit the young man&#x2019;s wife to remarry?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The Rabbis did not permit remarrying by the wife of a man, lost in a body of water of which not all the boundaries are visible, and no distinction was made as to the nature of the water, or the shore. We would be very happy were we able to find a legal basis for allowing the woman to remarry; but many before us have tried to find such a basis and were not successful. We must, therefore, accept the decision of the Rabbis.</p>

<h1><bold>253</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A and B were married to two sisters. Since A frequented B&#x2019;s house, B suspected him of adulterous relations with his wife, and threatened to kill him. One day A went out of town leaving his books and his valuables with his wife, his manner indicating that he intended to return shortly. He never came back, however, and a search for him proved futile. Subsequently, three Gentile thieves came to the house of a Jew of a neighboring town to sell a stolen article; and casually remarked that A, from the nearby town, was murdered through the instigation of his brother-in-law, and was buried in his clothes in an upright but inverted position. The Jew asked the thieves to show him where A was buried, and they answered that they would show him the place if he gave them one <italic>mark</italic>. On the same day, however, before they had a chance to point out A&#x2019;s grave, the thieves were apprehended for stealing and were hanged. Subsequently, a Jew arrived in town who told the relatives of A&#x2019;s wife that he had seen A alive in France. This Jew, however, had been an apostate and later returned to Judaism, but not wholeheartedly. He was one of those despicable creatures who wander from town to town and alternately appear as Jews or as fanatical Christians. Nevertheless, the relatives of A&#x2019;s wife sent a man with the apostate to France, and the man investigated thoroughly but could find no trace of A. Meanwhile a long time has passed, and the grass widow, lonely, miserable, and distressed, has not heard a word about the whereabouts of her husband.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Whenever a Gentile makes an informal statement to the effect that he witnessed the death of a Jew, we accept such statement as reliable evidence and permit the Jew&#x2019;s wife to remarry. Thus, the unsolicited remarks of the three thieves are to be considered as the testimony of three witnesses. Although the statement of the apostate contradicted the words of the thieves, we do not admit into evidence the testimony of a single witness in the face of the testimony of three witnesses. It is true that, although in a case involving the release of a grass widow we admit into evidence the testimony of ordinarily unqualified witnesses (such as women and Gentiles), the testimony of a single qualified witness is nevertheless considered equal to that of a hundred unqualified witnesses. In our case, the three Gentile witnesses were not contradicted by a qualified witness, for the apostate cannot be considered a qualified witness, since his return to the fold was not sincere. He and the others of his kind call themselves Jews in order that people should give them food, and that they should have a chance to steal and to indulge their base appetites. Therefore, if the communities of Rita and Kublin should agree, I would permit the woman to remarry.</p>

<p>Most scholars hold the opinion that a woman whose husband fell into a body of water whose final boundaries are not discernible, and who, though not permitted to remarry, defiantly transgressed against the prohibition of the Rabbis and did remarry, need not be divorced from her second husband. This opinion they base on the talmudic ruling that the law prohibiting the remarriage of a woman whose husband fell into a &#x201C;boundless&#x201D; body of water, applies only before, but not after, she has remarried. I once saw a prominent personage of our kingdom remarry under such circumstances without any one admonishing her. All our prominent scholars decided that she need not be divorced, once she has remarried. A great French scholar was then staying in our kingdom, and he, too, permitted her to stay married claiming that he had witnessed a similar case in France and that all the great scholars of France ruled that she need not be divorced. I also gave my consent to his decision though I was hesitant. However, I have finally come to the conclusion that such an opinion is untenable. For, were this opinion correct the prohibition of the Rabbis would be rendered senseless, useless, and ridiculous, since no woman would heed such prohibition and would transgress against it rather than stay single all her life. Why, then, would the Rabbis prohibit such remarriage to begin with&#x0021; Therefore, we must say that the talmudic ruling which does not require the remarried woman to be divorced, refers only to that woman who remarried because she innocently believed that a scholar had permitted her to do so, as in the case of Hassa (Yeb. 121b) and that of R. Shila (Yeb. 121a); but that it does not refer to the woman who defiantly transgressed the prohibition of the Rabbis. This latter interpretation of the pertinent talmudic sources clarifies the words of the Rabbis and renders them logical and tenable. Therefore, a woman who remarried without receiving permission from a scholar must be divorced, or the husband be put under the ban till he divorce her. We must not be concerned lest a relative of the woman permit her to remarry (thus flouting the prohibition of the Rabbis), for the following reasons: a) only a scholar holding the position among scholars that R. Nahman (the scholar who inadvertantly caused the wife of Hassa to remarry) and R. Shila held in their day, is empowered to permit such a woman to remarry; b) a scholar permitting such a woman to remarry would bring upon himself the ban.</p>

B&#x2019;s son, however, refused to marry A&#x2019;s daughter and B wants his money back. A claims that he had originally accepted B&#x2019;s money as a dowry for his daughter, that he had taken possession of the gift for her, and that the money, therefore, belongs to her.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A dowry gift becomes the property of the donee only if the marriage takes place. Therefore, neither A nor his daughter has ever gained title to B&#x2019;s money, and A must return the principal plus the interest to B. Even if B expressly stipulated that he will forfeit the 15 pounds if the marriage does not take place, such a stipulation is considered an <italic>Asmakhta</italic> and is not valid.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A negotiated a marriage between his daughter and B who was from out of town and whom A did not know very well. A deposited a pledge of twenty-five <italic>marks</italic> on condition that should his daughter refuse to marry B, the pledge would belong to B. A had stipulated, however, that the agreement be void in case he be prevented by unavoidable accident from carrying out his part of the agreement. Subsequently it became known that B was an epileptic. A&#x2019;s daughter, therefore, refused to marry him.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Even according to Rabbi Joel, who was doubtful whether or not an epileptic might be forced to divorce his wife, the pledge must be returned to A, since in cases of doubt we do not give a verdict in favor of one seeking to collect money from the other party to the suit. Moreover A had stipulated that his agreement with B should be void in case of unavoidable accident; the discovery that B was an epileptic and the rightful refusal, hence, of A&#x2019;s daughter to marry B because of the danger involved, constituted an unavoidable accident and thus voided the agreement. We must also take into consideration the possibility that B&#x2019;s children will be epileptic. Although the admonition of the Talmud (Yeb. 64b) not to marry into a family of epileptics applies to a family of which at least three members are epileptic, this admonition applies to the marrying of a person who is himself an epileptic even though no other member of his family is so afflicted. Moreover had B already married A&#x2019;s daughter, and were she to demand a divorce on the ground that she can not live with an epileptic, she would have been entitled to the return of her dowry; since no marriage has taken place, B is not entitled to receive any money from A. Even if the pledge was already delivered to B, there is not the slightest doubt that he must return it to A.</p>

If A&#x2019;s daughter would herself have made the above-mentioned agreement with B, and her father would subsequently betroth her to another, she would have had a plausible excuse for her not complying with the agreement. Since A himself, however, entered into an agreement with B, he not only guaranteed thereby that his daughter would accept <italic>kiddushin</italic> from B, but also that he himself would not prove a hindrance to the betrothal. B, therefore, is entitled to collect one <italic>mark</italic> of gold from A. B, however, must wait till A&#x2019;s daughter grows up before he will be entitled to collect the penalty, since in the meantime it may happen that A will not be prevented from fulfilling his original agreement with B.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Since B has been prevented, by death, from fulfilling his promise, he never became obligated to pay the 20<xref rid="fn8">&#x002A;</xref> <italic>marks</italic> to A. Consequently his heirs owe nothing to A.</p>

Now the groom refuses to abide by such stipulation claiming that he is not bound by his father&#x2019;s agreements.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the possessions of the young couple originally came from their parents, the former are bound by the stipulations of the latter regarding the disposal of such possessions.

A&#x2019;s wife died. When A returned, he demanded that B restore to him the valuables his late wife had entrusted to B.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A&#x2019;s wife had no right to promise a dowry or give anything to B or C without A&#x2019;s permission. Her promises and gifts were, therefore, void and B must return to A the valuables A&#x2019;s wife had deposited with him.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A had a sickly, epileptic daughter. He promised B a large dowry, and for this reason B married her. A&#x2019;s daughter died within the first year of her marriage, after having given birth to a child who, in turn, died before he was thirty days old. Since A&#x2019;s daughter left a child when she died, we decided that B was entitled to collect the dowry from A.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the child died before he was thirty days old, his viability has not been established. Therefore, his existence was of no consequence. Thus, I am greatly surprised that you considered the existence of the child a determining factor in the case. Moreover, Rashi and R. Tam hold conflicting opinions regarding the question whether a widower is entitled to collect the dowry his father-in-law had promised him (<italic>Tosaphot</italic> Ket. 47a, s. v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D1;</span>). I am greatly surprised, therefore, that you dare decide between the two conflicting opinions; for whenever there exists a difference of opinion between authorities, we do not enforce the collection of money by either party. Your contention that since A&#x2019;s daughter was a sickly person B had a stronger claim on her dowry, is also baseless, for the law draws no distinction between a healthy and a sickly wife. Indeed, the <italic>takkanah</italic> of R. Tam to the effect that when a wife dies within the first year of her marriage the husband must return her dowry to the original donors, is only valid in those communities where this <italic>takkanah</italic> was accepted. My decision in this case, however, is not based on this <italic>takkanah</italic>, but on Rabbinic law which is valid everywhere.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. L&#x2019;s father gave five pounds to L&#x2019;s fiance, C. Her father deposited with B the rest of L&#x2019;s dowry, with the provision that B deliver it to C one year after he marries L. C married L, but she died within the first year of her marriage. C, now, demands L&#x2019;s dowry from B.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. When a woman dies within the first year of her marriage, the ordinance of Rabbenu Tam undisputably prevails that her dowry must be returned to the donors. The communities have further ordained that when a woman dies within the second year of her marriage, half of her dowry must be returned to the donor. We are not certain, however, whether or not this latter ordinance was accepted. Moreover, even according to talmudic law the dowry mentioned above is not collectible, since according to R. Tam&#x2019;s interpretation of the pertinent talmudic ruling (ket. 47a) a person may not collect the dowry that had been promised to his wife, who subsequently died, unless he collected it before she died. There is no doubt, therefore, that C is not entitled to collect L&#x2019;s dowry from B (talmudic law), and that he must even return the five pounds he had already received (because of the ordinance of R. Tam). Should C deny having received the five pounds, he would have to take an oath in support of his denial. Since C, however, does not inherit L&#x2019;s dowry, he is under no obligation to pay for L&#x2019;s funeral. Therefore, he is not to be charged with the funeral expenses spent by L&#x2019;s father. Similarly, C is under no obligation to discharge L&#x2019;s pledges to charity, unless C had instructed L to make such pledges at his expense.</p>

This ruling, however, applies only to the father who had merely promised a dowry but failed to give it to his son-in-law before his daughter died. In our case, however, the son-in-law gained title to the dowry, for it was secured through pledges the father had deposited with trustees, or because sureties have guaranteed its delivery. The dowry was merely entrusted to the father-in-law that he do business therewith, and earn profit for the benefit of the young couple until they grow up. Therefore, the son-in-law is entitled to collect the dowry.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. In the presence of witnesses Leah asked A to betroth her. While she was in a yard not owned by her, A threw a ring into her lap for the purpose of betrothal. The witnesses, although they saw Leah shake her dresses in order to brush the ring away, did not see whether or not the ring actually fell into her lap. Does Leah need a divorce from A?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Had the witnesses seen the ring fall into Leah&#x2019;s lap, she would need a divorce in spite of her claim that she never intended to become A&#x2019;s wife and that she was joking when she asked him to betroth her. For we would, then, be concerned only with facts and not with her thoughts and unexpressed intentions. But, since the witnesses did not see the ring fall into Leah&#x2019;s lap, and the yard where the incident took place did not belong to Leah, she needs no divorce, for no betrothal took place. R. Meir adds: If my teachers agree with my decision, all will be well. But if they do not agree I shall subscribe to whatever they decide to do. However, I should prefer not to be strict in this matter and not to require Leah to obtain a divorce, lest A become rebellious and refuse to divorce her, and lest he travel to a distant land and thus render it impossible for the unfortunate woman ever to marry again.</p>

<p>The betrothal of a woman in the presence of a single witness, is void. We do not require that she receive a divorce, for the mere sake of strictness, since such an act would bar her from marrying a person of priestly lineage. Nor are we apprehensive of a spreading report to the effect that the woman was betrothed, since such report would also include the information that the betrothal took place in the presence of a single witness, thus automatically nullifying the effect of the report. If it was originally reported, however, that a bona fide betrothal took place, and later it became known that the betrothal took place in the presence of a single witness, a divorce would be required, if we did not deliberately cancel false reports. Rabiah, however, ruled that we should cancel false reports.</p>
<p>S<small>OURCES</small>: Pr. 133; Mord. Kid. 537; ibid. 548; Tesh. Maim. to <italic>Nashim</italic> 2; Rashba I, 856.</p>
<h1><bold>271</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A, a nephew of Rabbi Kohen Zedek, asked the latter for advice regarding the planned betrothal of his daughter. A informed him that in his (A&#x2019;s) locality there were no qualified witnesses (unrelated to the bride) but that he intended to invite two strangers from another locality to act as witnesses to the betrothal. These two strangers, however, were brothers-in-law and one was the nephew of the other. Rabbi Kohen Zedek, then, told A that since these two were related to each other they were disqualified witnesses and consequently the betrothal would be void. A, however, answered that no great harm would be done even if the betrothal were void since the bridegroom would ultimately betroth the bride again, at the time of the marriage. A repeated this answer to the widowed sister of Rabbi Kohen Zedek who later witnessed the betrothal and protested that the witnesses were disqualified. Must A&#x2019;s daughter receive a divorce in order to free herself from the bridegroom?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the two witnesses were related to each other, they were disqualified and the betrothal was not binding. Therefore, A&#x2019;s daughter needs no divorce. As to the spreading rumor that a betrothal took place, the opinion of Rav is accepted that when the court discovers that a certain rumor [of betrothal] had no foundation in fact, the court silences such rumor. Moreover, a rumor is of no consequence unless the probability of its truthful origin has been upheld in court (cf. Git. 89a f.), while in our case the rumor is known to be baseless.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kohen Zedek wrote again to Rabbi Meir raising doubt as to the correctness of R. Meir&#x2019;s decision, and informing him that his (R. Meir&#x2019;s) teacher from Spiers at first agreed with this decision but later disagreed with it; and that meanwhile A&#x2019;s daughter became betrothed to another man.</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir answered that the first decision of his teacher was correct; that in the case of a woman who was betrothed in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom was later discovered to be related to the bridegroom, Rabbi Joel haLevi decided in a Responsum that the woman did not need a divorce, and permitted her to remarry; and that he enclosed a copy of Rabbi Joel&#x2019;s Responsum in order to prove that his own decision was based on a solid foundation. He added: A rumor is of no consequence unless it be current in the town where the alleged betrothal took place. In this case, however, A and his sons were the only Jewish residents of the settlement, and they were told beforehand that such a betrothal would be void. Moreover, even the authorities who hold that we cannot dispel a rumor, agree that when a rumor is self-contradictory, or the statements made therein are not untrue but harmless, such rumor is of no consequence. We are not at liberty to be overstringent in such cases and demand that a divorce be delivered in order to dispel any shadow of doubt as to the girl&#x2019;s freedom to remarry, since such a step would make her ineligible to marry a man of priestly lineage.</p>
<p>The leaders of the communities [Spiers, Worms, and Mayence] upon learning that R. Meir permitted A&#x2019;s daughter to become betrothed to another man without first receiving a divorce from her first bridegroom, became highly incensed and heaped abuse upon R. Meir for having permitted a married woman to remarry. Rabbi Mordecai [of Worms, cf. Mord. Ket. 290] and his associates wrote that Rabbi Hananel in his <italic>Sefer Hamikzoot</italic>, the author of <italic>Sekel Tob</italic>, Rabiah, and Rabbi Simha [of Spiers], all ruled that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of unqualified witnesses, must receive her divorce before she is permitted to remarry. They placed A and his daughter [but probably not R. Meir] under the ban in order to force A&#x2019;s daughter to receive a divorce from her second bridegroom.</p>
<p>R. Meir became highly indignant. He pointed out the clear distinction between witnesses who were rabbinically disqualified and those who were Biblically disqualified. He proved that the above-mentioned authorities as well as Alfasi, Rabbi Kalonymus, and the author of <italic>Ittur</italic> [Rabbi Isaac b. Abba Mari of Marseilles] all agreed that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of Biblically disqualified witnesses required no divorce and was free to marry another. He showed that not a single authority contravened this view, and that the Rabbis of Spiers were misled in their haste and zeal by a faulty reading of the <italic>Sekel Tob</italic>.</p>
<p>R. Meir added: if the Rabbis of the communities subsequently discover an authority who ruled that such a woman must receive a divorce, they should realize that such a divorce was not required by Biblical law nor by rabbinic law, but that the authority of his own accord ruled that a divorce take place merely to dissipate evil gossip. Since the first betrothal of A&#x2019;s daughter took place in the presence of two witnesses who were beyond a doubt Biblically disqualified witnesses, as one of them was the nephew of the other, the betrothal was void; especially so since even at that time it was known to all bystanders that the betrothal possessed no validity whatsoever. Since she was subsequently betrothed to another, having first received permission from an authoritative court, no authority in the world would require that the Biblically valid second betrothal should be dissolved merely in order to dissipate unfounded doubts. Moreover, we are expressly enjoined by the Talmud from requiring that she receive a divorce from her second bridegroom, since such divorce would disqualify her from ever marrying her first bridegroom (Yeb. 11b). If the leaders of the communities are highly sensitive and are bent on dissipating any doubt in the matter, they should force the first bridegroom to grant a divorce to A&#x2019;s daughter and I, on my part, shall compel her to accept the divorce. Although such a divorce is unnecessary, and hence should not be granted, as it would bar the woman from ever marrying a man of priestly lineage, I should overlook this point in honor of the Rabbis of the communities. Accordingly A&#x2019;s daughter will wait for a divorce till the feast of <italic>Purim</italic>. If the communities will be unable to effect the divorce within that time, because of the stubbornness of the bridegroom and his refusal to comply with their request, we shall go against the wishes of the community leaders and allow A&#x2019;s daughter to marry her second bridegroom; as we shall not permit that she be put in a position where she can never remarry.</p>
<p>We have never seen revered teachers of old act in the manner of the above-mentioned community leaders. Differences of opinions have often arisen among the great authorities, some prohibiting what others permitted, but never did any one dare place under the ban those who acted contrary to his opinion. You, the aforementioned community leaders, probably delude yourselves with the idea that since your permission is required before a person may divorce his wife (see Finkelstein op. cit. p. 230), no scholar is permitted to render decisions in ritual law unless he receives your authorization. No, this is not true, for the <italic>Torah</italic> is free to anyone who is capable of arriving at a correct decision. You have gathered, and have associated with yourselves, men who do not understand the intricacies of the laws of marriage and divorce. I am not in a position to protest against my teacher of Spiers since I am his student [and owe him the respect and subservience of a student], but I protest against those who sought to ruin my reputation and honor. &#x201C;Blessed be the Lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth&#x201D;.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. B admits that when A first appointed him his deputy for the purpose of betrothing L for A&#x2019;s wife, he stipulated that B betroth her on condition that she has no physical defects. When A formally appointed B his deputy in the presence of witnesses, however, he failed to mention such a conditional arrangement; nor did B make any reference to such an arrangement when he betrothed L for A. L has protruding glandules on her neck and legs, and A refuses to marry her. Was the betrothal void?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the glandules are situated in a place where sometimes they may be seen while at other times they are hidden from view, the betrothal was concluded under error and was, therefore, void. The betrothal would have been void under such circumstances even if no condition had been stipulated by A. If the glandules, however, were situated in a place where they were always exposed to view, A must have seen them and must therefore have determined to overlook them, and certainly such was the case with reference to the glandules on her legs; the betrothal was therefore valid. The condition he had stipulated was of no avail since it must have referred to other defects besides the glandules. Moreover, we know that a condition was stipulated only through B&#x2019;s admission, which is not sufficient evidence. If A did not know L and had never seen her, however, the betrothal was void even if no condition had been stipulated. We should not permit A, however, to marry another woman since we have no record that the great Rabbis, our predecessors, ever permitted such a marriage in practice.

A&#x2019;s father, B (Moses), representing his son, brought forth the following claims: a) When he (B) had arranged the match with L&#x2019;s father, C (Judah), he had promised C to send his son to live in C&#x2019;s house; b) he kept his promise, and, after A betrothed L through a messenger, he sent A to C; c) at the time the match was arranged C promised to clothe A suitably, to support him, and to hire a capable teacher for him; d) after A stayed in C&#x2019;s house for one year, he was sent back to his father and C took no further notice of him; A was forced to interrupt his studies and he, B, with very limited means, had to support him for five difficult years; and, f) he asked many persons to urge C to keep his promise of support to A, but C refused. The undersigned (R. Meir) also, sent many letters to C, asking him to have pity on his son-in-law who suffered poverty and privation &#x2014; all to no avail. Moreover, we have learned (from a letter) that C does not at all desire the consummation of the marriage, but has set his heart on a divorce since A displeased him. Thus, B claims that he has fulfilled his promise and sent his son to C; but, that the latter put A to shame and now he, B, can no longer force A to return to C&#x2019;s house; that A is afraid to return to C&#x2019;s place of residence since many persons have warned him that C&#x2019;s servants were threatening to do him injury unless he agree to divorce L; that though A cannot, and will not, return to C, he is nevertheless ready to marry L whenever she will come to his place of residence.</p>
<p>Taking the above into consideration, we have decided that A cannot be compelled to settle in C&#x2019;s town, marry L, and live with her there; nor can he be forced to divorce L. Our decision is based on irrefutable proof: Thus, the majority of our leading authorities agree that a man living in one country who betrothed a woman living in another country, may force the woman to come and live with him in his country. Although the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) and the Palestinian Talmud, (Ket. 13, 10) seem to disagree on this score, we believe that our interpretation of the statements in these two sources removes the discrepancy and shows that both agree regarding this law. Moreover, when the man betrothed the woman through a messenger, there is not a shadow of a doubt that according to both sources given above, the woman ought to be forced to move to her husband&#x2019;s place of residence. This opinion is shared by Rashi, Maimonides and other leading authorities. R. Tam, however, believes that these sources deal with cases in which we force the husband to change his place of residence to that of his wife. Therefore, in view of this difference of opinion (although I do not agree with the view of R. Tam) we must accept the strictures of each opinion. Thus, we are forced to decide that neither the husband nor the wife can force a change in the other&#x2019;s place of residence. We cannot compel the husband to change his place of residence because of the opinion of Rashi, Maimonides, and the other leading authorities; but neither can we compel the wife to change her place of residence, because of the opinion of R. Tam. Although B had agreed at the time of the betrothal that A would settle in C&#x2019;s town, B had no right to bind A to such terms and we can find no evidence that A had voluntarily agreed to change his place of residence. The fact that A went to visit C is no evidence of such voluntary agreement. Moreover, he went on this visit after the betrothal, while we are concerned with his intentions at the time of the betrothal. Therefore, this agreement between B and C is void. Furthermore, had A himself voluntarily agreed at the time of the betrothal to move to C&#x2019;s place of residence, we should not be able to force A to keep his part of the agreement since C, on his part, had made many promises at that time which he later failed to keep.</p>
<p>Some Rabbis wrote their opinion that A should be compelled to move to L&#x2019;s place of residence since it was not dignified for a woman to move from place to place, as expressed by the verse: &#x201C;All glorious is the king&#x2019;s daughter within the palace&#x201D; (Ps. 45,11; cf. Git. 12a). Moreover, it is humiliating for a woman to pursue her husband into a distant place. However, I regard this manner of reasoning as very strange indeed; for in the talmudic period women were more honorable and discreet than today, and yet talmudic law required them to move to their husband&#x2019;s place of residence. The aforementioned Rabbis also wrote that since, according to the Talmud, a woman&#x2019;s station may be elevated through marriage but not lowered, L should not be forced to move to A&#x2019;s town. For L was brought up in great luxury and abundance, and were she to move to A&#x2019;s house she would have to share his poverty and privation. However, L would not have to suffer privation. C had promised A a large sum of money as a dowry; with that money A should be able to support L in a manner befitting her station, and on a standard equal to that of the other women of her family. Although she would miss some of the extravagances of her father&#x2019;s house, she would have to bear with such minor inconvenience. In conclusion, since A is ready to marry L whenever she will come to live in his town, we cannot compel A to move to L&#x2019;s town or to divorce her. This decision is required by talmudic law and the Rabbis made no distinction between a poor woman and a rich woman. Signed: R. Meir b. Baruch.</p>

<p>The following Responsa by R. Samuel b. Salomo, R. Jacob B. Joseph, R. Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi, and R. Eliezer B. Ephraim, refer to the same case:</p>
<p>This letter is written regarding the youth of Rothenburg who betrothed, through a messenger, the daughter of R. Judah of D&#x00FC;ren. At the time the match was concluded the youth&#x2019;s father had agreed that his son would take up his permanent abode with his father-in-law. After the betrothal the bridegroom came to stay with R. Judah who hired a teacher for him and treated him honorably for a long time. A year later the youth became sick and R. Judah, thinking that this was a result of the change of climate, sent him home accompanied by his teacher, and expended large sums of money on him. Subsequently, R. Judah sent for the youth to come to his house and marry his daughter. The youth, however, changed his mind on the matter of residence, and refused to come to D&#x00FC;ren, stating however that he was ready to marry his bride if and when she came to live in Rothenburg. Thus it is apparent that the youth was intending to exact money from R. Judah. Therefore, it is my opinion that the youth be forced either to marry his bride on her terms, or divorce her. First, it is obvious that at the time of her betrothal the bridegroom had intended to settle in D&#x00FC;ren. Secondly, his father had explicitly agreed with R. Judah to the youth&#x2019;s change of abode. Therefore, we assume that the youth also had agreed to it, since a young son does not dare to oppose his father and usually subscribes to the father&#x2019;s arrangement of his affairs. Again in agreements arising between the various parties interested in a marriage, the conditions apparently implied, though not expressly stated, are presumed to form part of such agreements (see Git. 65b; Ket. 54b; 79a; B. B. 132a). Thus, in our case, it is apparent that R. Judah did not intend to have his daughter leave him and her mother and remove from the country of her birth, and suffer privation in Rothenburg with her poverty stricken husband; that he did not intend to spend the large sum of money required to finance the safe conduct of one who was the daughter of a magnate whose name was known throughout the countries. Thus, the overlord of Rothenburg acting on the mere rumor [that R. Judah&#x2019;s daughter was coming to settle in Rothenburg] already sought ways of subjugating R. Judah to his will [using his daughter as a hostage]. Finally, according to the Talmud (Ket. 110b) a husband cannot force his wife to move from a humble to a more sumptuous dwelling since she can hold that such change of abode, even though it was for the better, would cause her many inconveniences. Any woman who gives plausible reasons against the change of abode demanded by her husband, therefore, cannot be forced to undertake such a change. In our case the bride&#x2019;s reasons against a change of abode are numerous and reasonable. Therefore, the youth ought to be forced by flagellation or the use of the ban either to marry his bride or to divorce her. This case was already brought before us last year, and we decided in the bride&#x2019;s favor. Because of these reasons, I have agreed to ban and chastise the bridegroom until he either marry his bride on her terms or divorce her. If he refuses to comply with our order he shall bear his sin and those who support him shall likewise suffer. None is excluded from our ban, excepting, of course, our honored teacher Rabbi Meir. Rabbenu Gershom requires that a husband be coerced into divorcing his rebellious wife lest the latter turn to mischief. Although many authorities disagree with Rabbenu Gershom and we do not follow his decision, in cases similar to the one at hand, however, we must protect the daughters of Israel lest unscrupulous youths use the inability and unwillingness of daughters of rich men to change their place of residence, as a means of extorting money from their fathers. Signed: Samuel b. Salomo (Pr. 250).</p>
<p>Wailing and complaint that cannot be silenced, arose because of Jacob b. Moses who betrothed the daughter of R. Judah&#x2026;. The bridegroom may be coerced either to marry the bride on her terms or divorce her. R. Tam decided that a court must compel a levir to marry, or give <italic>halitzah</italic> to his brother&#x2019;s childless widow, even by the use of force; and that it is even permissible to have Gentiles use force on the levir until he comply with the decision of the Jewish court. Although according to the Jerusalem Talmud whenever the Mishna fails expressly to allow the use of coercion we can use no physical compulsion (Ket. 11, 7), and although the ban is a strong form of coercion, nevertheless, since R. Tam allowed the use of physical compulsion (in a case where the Mishna does not expressly allow the use of such measures, cf. B. Yeb. 39a) we ought to ban the bridegroom until he comply with our decision. Moreover, custom changes law; whenever we are uncertain regarding a certain law, we observe and follow the accepted practice. Thus, the custom is universally accepted of performing the marriage ceremony in the house of the bride&#x2019;s father. Therefore, we invoked against the youth all the curses great and small, until he comply with our decision. Signed Jacob b. Rabbi Joseph (Pr. 251).</p>
<p>To our Rabbis of Germany, your love has obliged me to express my opinion regarding the above. Since witnesses testify to the fact that there was a stipulated condition at the time of the betrothal, such condition is binding and the bridegroom must live up to its terms. Even if there are no such witnesses, the fact that his father-in-law kept him in his house together with his teacher, even though he returned home because of illness, proves that the father-in-law intended that the wedding take place in his house. It is difficult to imagine that the latter intended to brave the grave danger of sending his daughter and his money to Germany, which is very unsafe country. Furthermore, a man may not force his wife to leave her country and to come to live in his country. Therefore, we may force the bridegroom to do one of two things: either marry his bride and come to live in her place of residence, or divorce her. The Rabbis ought to coerce him by the use of chastisement and the ban, for fear lest his bride remain a deserted wife. We find many instances where the Rabbis decreed special laws and took extraordinary measures in order to prevent the possibility of a woman remaining a deserted wife. Signed: Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi (Pr. 251).</p>
<p>To my teacher Rabbi Meir. I saw the decision of the judges in the case of the honorable R. Judah of D&#x00FC;ren who betrothed his daughter to Jacob b. Moses of Rothenburg. At the time of the betrothal Moses agreed to send his son Jacob to D&#x00FC;ren in order that he marry his bride there. Moses kept his agreement and sent his son to R. Judah. But, when the latter saw that Jacob was small in stature, homely, and despicable, he had pity on his daughter. Fearing lest she begin to despise her bridegroom, he sent Jacob back to his father to stay there till he grow up. When the bride grew up and R. Judah was told that Jacob also gained in strength, he sent for the latter to come and marry his bride. However, Moses refused to send Jacob to D&#x00FC;ren. As time dragged on and R. Judah&#x2019;s daughter saw that her bridegroom refused to come to her, she sent a messenger to Rothenburg to demand that Jacob either marry her on the conditions previously agreed upon, or divorce her. But Jacob answered that he did not personally agree to move to D&#x00FC;ren, that he did not join in his father&#x2019;s agreement on that score, that he would not come to her father&#x2019;s house, and that he would marry her only if she come to Rothenburg. Thereupon it was decided [by R. Meir] that she could not compel Jacob to move to D&#x00FC;ren nor force him to divorce her. This decision, however, is very strange, and, in my opinion, is a perversion of justice for a number of reasons. a) Some of our great authorities quote the opinion of R. Tam to the effect that both the Mishna (Ket. 13, 10) and the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) which treat of the conditions under which a party to a marriage may be forced to remove to the place of residence of the other party, deal with forcing the husband to move to the place of residence of the wife. Therefore, the conclusion of both sources is that the husband who married a wife living in another country must move to that country. Again, whenever the talmudic sources state that the husband be so forced to move, the implication is that upon refusing to do so he must divorce his wife and pay her the <italic>ketubah</italic>. Next, it is well known that the bride&#x2019;s home is luxurious and comfortable [for which reason she ought not to be forced to remove to her husband&#x2019;s humble abode], that her traveling to Rothenburg would entail great difficulties and serious hazards since the entire road is infested with lurking dangers, and that her very stay in Rothenburg would be perilous because of her father&#x2019;s great reputation for wealth. Therefore, Jacob cannot force her to take such a step. Besides, even if she wanted to go to Rothenburg, her father&#x2019;s repeated objections would not allow her to do so, and she could do nothing about it. Therefore, this case is similar to the one quoted in the Mishna (Ket. 13, 5), in which case Admon decided that the bride might demand from her bridegroom that he either marry, or divorce her. Finally, Jacob is bound by his father&#x2019;s agreement, since it is customary for the parents of a couple to enter into all agreements governing the marriage, and for such agreements to be considered binding on the couple. Although the principle is accepted that &#x201C;the consent of the father does not imply the consent of the son (Kid. 45b)&#x201D;, this principle applies only to the actual betrothal but not to the other arrangements appertaining thereto. Moreover, the fact that he came to live in D&#x00FC;ren proves that he had agreed to his father&#x2019;s arrangement; while his having been sent home temporarily, because of illness, did not invalidate the original agreement.</p>
<p>Therefore, it seems to me that the decision cited above was a perversion of justice, or, at least, against common sense, and not in the interest of the public welfare. For were we to accept the principle implied in your decision, the interests of the wealthy would suffer greatly. Thus many unscrupulous persons, knowing that the daughters of the rich cannot move away from their home towns, would betroth such women and then extort money from their fathers by refusing to marry them until either the women move away from their homeland, or their fathers pay exorbitant sums of money. And you, my teacher, R. Meir, how did you come to subscribe to such a decision? Everybody is wondering at this. For R. Judah is ready to fulfill all his previous promises and more; he wants Jacob and the bride also wants him. They are ready to give guarantees that they will not act treacherously against him; and, in case he does not want her, she is ready to accept her divorce and forego her <italic>ketubah</italic>. In the face of such facts, how can any Rabbi, student, or judge, give heed to those who insidiously demand that R. Judah&#x2019;s daughter come to live in Rothenburg, knowing full well that she can not do so&#x0021; It is obvious that these persons are only interested in extorting money from R. Judah, and it is not becoming your dignity to uphold the cause of these extortionists. Should we allow an Israelite daughter to become a deserted wife because her father is averse to becoming a victim of extortion? I know that R. Judah did not acquiesce; that he could not bear the idea of being coerced and forced to part with his money; and that he sent inquiries to the elders, the greatest authorities of France, and to other places. It appears that those authorities have all agreed that Jacob ought to be forced to marry his bride on her own terms or to divorce her. Although you are the greatest authority of our generation, you will not find it easy to oppose the decision of our great authorities, lest dissensions multiply in Israel. &#x201C;Therefore, leave off contention, before the quarrel break out&#x201D; (Proverbs 17,14).

France, England, Germany, and Bohemia, are to be considered separate countries in reference to the laws of marriage, since a different language is spoken in each of these lands. It is indeed reasonable to assume that only territories within which a different language is spoken are to be considered as different countries in the above sense. Were we to consider Saxony, Franconia, Alsace, the Rhine province, and Bavaria, separate countries, then Palestine, a land of four hundred miles by four hundred miles, would have had to be considered a land containing more than three countries.</p>

Subsequently, however, A went back to his father and then demanded that L follow him. L, who was in possession of the valuables of the household, refused to do so. Without L&#x2019;s knowledge or consent, her mother appeared before prominent persons and reached an agreement with A that L live out of town. She also bound herself by a valid <italic>kinyan</italic> to deliver the valuables mentioned above to A. L, however, protested vigorously against this agreement claiming that she refused to deliver the valuables to A lest he run away from her leaving her penniless.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. L&#x2019;s mother had no right to enter into agreements to L&#x2019;s disadvantage without the latter&#x2019;s consent. Therefore, the agreement between L&#x2019;s mother and A is void.</p>

B denies that such condition was ever stipulated. Since A&#x2019;s daughter is in possession of the couple&#x2019;s property, may we rely on A&#x2019;s oath.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A, as a relative, can take no oath in a litigation between his daughter and his son-in-law. Nevertheless, B may not force his wife to move to another country. For R. Tam is of the opinion that the Talmud enjoins a husband, who married his wife under such circumstances, from forcing her to remove to another town.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. The husband may not compel his wife to permit him to sell his real property. If he says he has no money, the court will sell his real property, and will use the money exclusively for the wife&#x2019;s sustenance in the manner prescribed by the Talmud (Ket. 107a). When this money is spent, the husband will be forced to work in order to support his wife, in accordance with the clause of the <italic>ketubah</italic>: &#x201C;and I shall work, honor, and sustain thee&#x2026;&#x201D; Although some authorities are opposed to a literal interpretation of this clause of the <italic>ketubah</italic>, I have noticed that our Rabbis of France follow this literal interpretation in practice.

<p><italic>A</italic>. Your reasoning is correct as far as the older children are concerned, but does not apply to those under six years of age, for as the Rabbis decreed that a husband must provide his wife with food and sustenance even if she has property of her own, they also decreed that a father feed his children until they reach the age of six, even though they have property of their own.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. An orphaned daughter is entitled to a dowry equal to one-tenth the estate left by her father. Is she entitled to one-tenth of the movables forming part of her father&#x2019;s estate?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. She is entitled to one-tenth of the immovables only. Although nowadays, because of the ordinance of the Saburaim, a woman collects her <italic>ketubah</italic>, and all other obligations stipulated therein, from movables, the dowry of a daughter is not an obligation included in the <italic>ketubah</italic>, and, therefore, is not included in the abovementioned ordinance.</p>

<p>One-tenth of the property, to which a minor daughter is entitled out of her father&#x2019;s estate according to talmudic law, means real property only. Thus a minor daughter is entitled to one-tenth of the real property left by her father, but is not entitled to any part of the movable property left by him.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A often strikes his wife. A&#x2019;s aunt, who lives at his home, is usually the cause of their arguments, and adds to the vexation and annoyance of his wife.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A Jew must honor his wife more than he honors himself. If one strikes one&#x2019;s wife, one should be punished more severely than for striking another person. For one is enjoined to honor one&#x2019;s wife but is not enjoined to honor the other person. Therefore, A must force his aunt to leave his house, and must promise to treat his wife honorably. If he persists in striking her, he should be excommunicated, lashed, and suffer the severest punishments, even to the extent of amputating his arm. If his wife is willing to accept a divorce, he must divorce her and pay her the <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>

Even when she appeared in the Synagogue to demand that A pay the debts she had contracted in order to pay for her sustenance [probably during a period of separation], A stubbornly refused to promise that in the future he would refrain from beating her.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A must pay for his wife&#x2019;s sustenance since by his action he has shown that he had not decided to desist from his shameful practice. One deserves greater punishment for striking his wife than for striking another person, for he is enjoined to respect her. Far be it from a Jew to do such a thing. Had a similar case come before us we should hasten to excommunicate him. Thus, R. Paltoi Gaon rules that a husband who constantly quarrels with his wife must remove the causes of such quarrels, if possible, or divorce her and pay her the <italic>ketubah</italic>; how much more must a husband be punished, who not only quarrels but actually beats his wife.</p>

Nowadays, however, there are many impudent and brazen women, and the above assumption is no longer true. Moreover, in this case there is reason to believe that L is lying since her husband has had children with a former wife. Even though he might have weakened since, we can put no trust in L&#x2019;s words. Therefore, we must not force the husband to grant L a divorce, but we ought to persuade him to do so.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. L says that her husband is impotent and has had no sexual intercourse with her for the two years since their wedding day. She demands, therefore, that he divorce her and pay her the <italic>ketubah</italic>. L&#x2019;s husband admits that he is impotent but attributes this to his being bewitched.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since L&#x2019;s husband admits that he is impotent, there is not the slightest doubt that he must divorce her and pay her the <italic>ketubah</italic>. If L pleads that she wants to be free to remarry and to have children who will comfort and support her in her old age, we are permitted to force her husband, even by flagellation, to divorce her. If she enters no such plea, however, we can not force him by flagellation but we can by threats of dishonoring him. When he does divorce her he must pay her the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic> and her dowry, but is under no obligation to pay her the additional jointure. If she admits having brought in as dowry a sum less than the fifty pounds written in her <italic>ketubah</italic> &#x2014; in your town these fifty pounds are interpreted to mean one hundred <italic>marks</italic> &#x2014; she is entitled to such a sum only. If witnesses testify to the exact amount she brought in as her dowry, she is entitled to receive that amount only. If there are no witnesses, however, she is entitled to receive the full fifty pounds as her dowry. In case, however, her husband gave away his personal property as gifts to others to make it impossible for L to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic>, the following distinction must be made: If while granting the gifts he mentioned the contingency of his death, she is still entitled to collect her dowry from such gifts; if he gave his personal property away as outright gifts, however, she may not collect from these gifts. Should her husband brave the disapproval of the Rabbis and refuse to divorce her, we must add to her <italic>ketubah</italic> three denars per week for the entire period of his refusal.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A has been dripping blood for the past four years. During that period he refrained from sexual intercourse with his wife on the ground that his doctors forbade him to have intercourse as it endangered his life. Is A to be considered a rebellious husband and hence should three denars per week be added to his wife&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic> for the period of his abstention?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since A was forced by illness to refrain from intercourse with his wife, he is not to be considered a rebellious husband. A rebellious husband is one who refuses to live with his wife because he is angry with her or because he hates her. A person who is physically unable to live with his wife, however, is not considered a rebellious husband. A, however, must divorce his wife and must pay her the <italic>ketubah</italic>, since he is in the same category as a leper for whom coitus is harmful (Ket. 77b). Although A&#x2019;s sickness does not disable him permanently and is curable, we do not compel his wife to wait indefinitely in the hope that he might be cured. Thus Maimonides (M. T. Ishut 14, 7) rules that under such circumstances a woman must wait only six months. Although we have compared A to a leper for whom coitus is harmful, nevertheless we should not force A by flagellation to divorce his wife, but should only resort to persuasion. We should merely tell him the law requires him to divorce his wife and pay her the <italic>ketubah</italic>; should he refuse to do so, he would be called &#x201C;transgressor&#x201D;. Whether A divorces her or not, however, we force him to pay his wife the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic> and her dowry, but we do not force him to pay her the additional jointure since some authorities hold the opinion that under the circumstances she is not entitled to the additional jointure. Should A&#x2019;s wife aver that she does not believe that A&#x2019;s doctors told him to refrain from sexual intercourse, and insist that he is a rebellious husband, he would have to take an oath in support of his assertions. Should A refuse to take the oath, we would have to add to his wife&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic> three Tyrian denars per week for the entire period of his abstention. I have sufficient proof to support my view that the three denars prescribed by the Mishnah (Ket. 5, 7) mean Tyrian denars. Should A admit that he had refrained from sexual intercourse with his wife because he was angry with her and that he had lied about both his sickness and the advice of his doctors, and should he declare that he now desires to resume marital relations with her, the aforementioned amount would be added to her <italic>ketubah</italic> and she would be required to resume her marital duties. Regardless of what happened in the past, A may now claim that he is well and that he is able to live normally with his wife, since the truth of his claim is bound eventually to be proven or disproven.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A married off his son to B&#x2019;s daughter, giving a dowry of twenty <italic>marks</italic> which A deposited with B. Subsequently, A&#x2019;s son quarrelled with his wife and returned to his father&#x2019;s house. He appointed his father his trustee and the latter demanded that B return the dowry deposited with him since it was given to him for safe-keeping only. B claimed that he gave the money to his daughter while the young couple still lived happily together; that his daughter used the money in business since she was active in business and earned the income for the family, while her husband devoted all his time to studies; that A&#x2019;s son never asked him for the money, and that A never told him not to give the money to his daughter. B also mentioned his daughter&#x2019;s complaints that A&#x2019;s son did unmentionable things to her, conducting himself in a disgusting manner, and thus became hateful to her. She now demanded that he divorce her and pay her the <italic>ketubah</italic>, as she said that she despised her husband, would never live with him again, and would rather go begging from door to door than remain with him.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B must take an oath to the effect that he gave the money to his daughter while she was still living in peace and harmony with her husband, and thus be free from obligation. Since B&#x2019;s daughter was a rebellious wife she ought to be dealt with as such. I already wrote to you, while I was in Konstanze, my opinion regarding the law governing a rebellious wife. We follow the ordinance of the Geonim and permit her to keep all she brought to her husband as dowry (<italic>Nikse Zon Barzel</italic>), and whatever he brought is returned to him, nor is she entitled to the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic>; she is then to wait until either he consents to divorce her, or she decides to go back to him. If we suspect, however, that she does not dislike her husband but revolts against him because of financial considerations, or because her father, her mother, or her relatives induce her to quarrel with him, we take away from her even her dowry. In such a case we must follow the law in all its strictness and give all the possessions of the couple to the husband, for the ordinance of the Geonim mentioned above does not apply to the woman who rebels against her husband because she is persuaded to do so by others.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. Leah&#x2019;s father was justified in his act for a number of reasons: a) A woman who loathes her husband and demands a divorce is entitled to collect from her husband everything that is left of her dowry. There is no doubt, therefore, that she may retain such dowry. b) R. Jacob Tam took into consideration the fact that a father promises a dowry to his daughter in the expectation that she will live with her husband. He, therefore, ruled that a husband whose wife died before he collected her dowry, can no longer collect it. The same principle applies to our case. c) If a man seizes the property of a debtor for the benefit of a single creditor while the debtor owes money to other creditors, such seizure is of no avail, and the other creditors may take away said property. But, if the man who seized the property hands it over to the creditor for whose benefit he seized it, the act is valid and the other creditors can do nothing about it. In our case, too, Leah already received the money from her father.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Within the first year of her marriage to A, L claimed that she detested him and could not live with him. Before their marriage, money had been given to L by her father, as a present, on condition that A never have a right to it. L, therefore, demanded this money and the accrued income thereof. On the other hand, L&#x2019;s father had promised a dowry to A but had postponed the date of delivery of such dowry, having expressed the fear that L might rebel against her husband within the first year of her marriage. A, therefore, demands the dowry from L&#x2019;s father.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Although no present can be given to a married woman on condition that her husband have no right thereto, such a present may be given to her during the period of betrothal and thereupon the husband will have no right to such present or the income thereof. Therefore, the present and the accrued income must be returned to L. This decision is effective only if L&#x2019;s dislike of A is deep and genuine and is not induced by anyone. The community must pronounce the ban (<italic>herem</italic>) against anyone holding information relative to this matter; and if it be discovered that someone has induced L to rebel against A, then the money may be withheld from her as a punishment until she repents. The court always has a right to punish one even unduly, if such punishment will help to check lawlessness and indecency. In this case the punishment of L will serve as a warning to other women. Moreover, should A desire to marry another woman, I believe that he should be permitted to throw a bill of divorcement to L even against her will, since she is the rebellious party. A, however, is not entitled to the dowry promised to him by L&#x2019;s father, since the latter had expressed his intention of giving such dowry only in the event that L and A lived happily together.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A promised under a ban that he would never deal treacherously with his wife, L, and that should he break his promise, he would give her half of his money. Subsequently he broke his promise, whereupon L left him and he paid her half of his money in accordance with his agreement. They later became reconciled to each other, however, and lived together again in harmony and love until her mother persuaded her to leave him. Now A demands the return of his wife and the restoration of his money.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A&#x2019;s promise was not accompanied by a <italic>Kinyan</italic> made before an authoritative court, it was merely an <italic>Asmakhta</italic> and was void. L, then, must restore the money to A. He should atone in a manner that the Rabbi might prescribe for him for having transgressed the ban. Although a rebellious wife is entitled to receive the money she brought with her as her dowry, L is not entitled to such money since she did not rebel against A of her own accord, but was persuaded to do so by her mother. Thus the communities, [at their synod held] in W&#x00FC;rzburg, passed an ordinance to the effect that whenever a woman shall be led to rebel against her husband through the persuasions of her relatives, and shall refuse to heed all warnings, all the possessions of the couple shall become the sole property of her husband, and he shall be permitted to divorce her, even against her will, without giving her a penny. I believe that all Israel should abide by this ordinance which was instituted for the public benefit, especially since the money of the couple belongs to the husband according to talmudic law, and we need not resort to an ordinance. Since the law prescribes that whatever a woman acquires belongs to her husband (Gitt. 77b), why should we seek to infringe upon his rights, and especially in a case where the woman loves her husband, but was merely persuaded by her relatives to rebel against him, and where, therefore, there is no fear lest she resort to mischief? In such a case we must follow the law in all its strictness and give all the possessions of the couple to the husband, for the ordinance of the Geonim to the effect that the dowry be returned to the rebellious wife does not apply to the wife who rebelled against her husband not for personal reasons, but because she was persuaded to do so by others.</p>

<p>A claims that his father-in-law, B, alienated his wife&#x2019;s affections and also withheld his money. B claims: a) when he gave his daughter to A he stipulated the condition that A deposit sixty pounds with him; b) A agreed to this condition and gave the money to B and to his daughter stipulating that should A overindulge in food and drink or generally squander his money, he and his daughter would withhold the money until A bettered his habits; c) this agreement was accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic>; d) that A drew up a bond to that effect which bond is still in B&#x2019;s possession; e) A abstracted the sixty pounds from his wife, and therefore she refuses to live with him, or to give him money that was originally designated for buying her ornaments. A disclaims signing such bond, and denies having squandered any money or being guilty of any improper behavior. He denies having abstracted the money from B&#x2019;s daughter for the purpose of squandering it, but says that he had taken it only because he was afraid lest B rob him of his money and deprive him of his wife, as B had done with his other sons-in-law.</p>
<p>A further claims that B turned him over to a wicked Gentile who almost murdered him. A, therefore, demands that B be punished. B, on the other hand, gives a different account of the affair. He says that a Gentile, a violent man, placed a <italic>mark</italic> (8 ounces) of gold in pledge with him; and he, in turn, deposited it with A. When A wanted to leave town, B fearing lest the Gentile bring false accusations against him upon failing to produce the pledge, demanded that A return the gold <italic>mark</italic> to him. A invited B to go to the Gentile, and promised to free B from obligation to the Gentile. The Gentile, however, refused to listen to A and warned B that he (the Gentile) would collect double its value should his gold <italic>mark</italic> be lost. B, therefore, grabbed A by the clothes and said to the Gentile that his gold <italic>mark</italic> was in A&#x2019;s possession. The Gentile, then, angered by A&#x2019;s words made extreme threats against A. Nevertheless, A suffered no bodily injury nor any loss of money on account of this incident.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the agreement was made at the time of the betrothal, it is binding on A. At a betrothal, verbal agreements are binding, and whenever verbal promises are binding &#x2014; as in charity-gifts, Temple-gifts, or vows &#x2014; they are binding even when made in the form of conditional promises which are usually classified as <italic>asmakhta</italic>. If the money in question was part of the dowry given by B to his daughter, the agreement is certainly binding on A. Moreover, even if the agreement was entered into after the betrothal, it would also be binding if it was accompanied by a <italic>kinyan</italic> made before the notables of the community, who normally constitute an authoritative court.</p>
<p>Regarding A&#x2019;s complaint that B informed against him, A is not entitled to compensation since he suffered no damages. As to punishing B for complaining to a Gentile against A, I have no authority to impose fines. The community, however, has the right to impose fines, and also to punish a member for improper acts committed by him. Such fines are to be imposed in accordance with the status of the individuals involved.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A rebellious wife who refuses to live with her husband admits that she has never allowed her husband to come near her. What should be done to her?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the women of our generation are loose in their manner of life, we do not permit the husband to remarry while she is forced to remain single till old age, which procedure was recommended by R. Eleazar b. Nathan, and we do not require a waiting period of twelve months till the divorce be granted. Therefore, the elders of the community should endeavor to persuade both parties to a speedy divorce without resorting to coercion of either party. Upon the granting of the divorce the woman should receive only what she actually brought in as dowry, but not the full fifty pounds of dowry written in her <italic>ketubah</italic>; for when the husband received her dowry and evaluated it at fifty pounds, though actually it was worth less, he did so because he wanted to marry her and live with her. Now that she refuses to live with him she loses the extra value placed on her dowry, the additional jointure promised her by the husband, as well as the 200 <italic>zuzin</italic> prescribed by the Talmud. Though in this country the same amount of dowry is written in the <italic>ketubah</italic> of a rich as in that of a poor bride, irrespective of the amount she actually brings in, in order not to shame the brides who bring in a small dowry, this rebellious wife is not entitled to collect the full amount of dowry written in her <italic>ketubah</italic>, since she never lived with her husband.</p>

<p>Your objection to this procedure on the ground that any woman upon seeing her husband losing his property and sinking into poverty would become a rebellious wife, seize his remaining property and enjoy its use, is not very serious as she would not enjoy it very much, for, her husband may refuse to divorce her.

<p>Nowadays the talmudic law regarding a rebellious wife no longer applies. The ordinance of the Saboraim prevails instead, that when a woman refuses to live with her husband, he is immediately to be coerced into granting her a divorce. This ordinance was instituted in order that Jewish women should not turn to mischief. The woman is to receive whatever she has brought in as her dowry (<italic>Nikse Zon Barzel</italic>), and whatever is left of her own property to which her husband had the right of usufruct (<italic>Nikse Melug</italic>). The Geonim ruled that she was also entitled to the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic>. The husband is to be coerced, by threat of excommunication, into granting the divorce, for who will dare contradict the decisions of the great luminary Rabbenu Gershom, the Geonim, Alfasi, Maimonides, and R. Isaac di Trani? One may not object that such favorable treatment would encourage many women to rebel against their husbands; Heaven forfend, Jewish daughters are not suspected of such malefaction. They prefer to stay married even in adverse circumstances, and would not seek a divorce unless actually driven thereto.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Leah rebelled against her husband A, the son of Mendel Kern. When warned that she might lose her <italic>ketubah</italic> and the dowry (which she brought in upon her marriage) and that she might be forced to wait for many years for her divorce she threatened, among other things, to go and live among the Gentiles. Since the women of Regensburg were always arrogant in their relations to their husbands and now are even more supercilious than ever, Leah should be dealt with in a manner that would serve as a warning to her haughty sisters. A should be permitted to remarry immediately in accordance with the view of R. Eliezer b. Nathan, while Leah should be forced to wait for her divorce for many years. However, Leah should not be left entirely to the mercy of her husband who, after marrying another woman, might demand an exorbitant sum for Leah&#x2019;s divorce, or might refuse to divorce her altogether. We, therefore, leave it to you to decide upon a proper punishment for Leah.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. In order to curtail the possibility of Jewish women turning to mischief, and in order that people might not say: &#x201C;This one is A&#x2019;s wife and this one his paramour&#x201D;, we should not permit the husband to remarry before he divorces his rebellious wife. Therefore, A should receive a limited amount of money and give Leah her divorce, or, he should give Leah a divorce on condition that the divorce become valid (from now and) twelve months, or two years, after date. After the delivery of such a conditional divorce, A may be permitted to remarry immediately. If, however, Leah had good reason to detest her husband, she should be dealt with more leniently. Therefore, you should use your judgment in determining the severity with which Leah is to be punished.</p>

<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. L&#x2019;s representative claims that her husband has seized her garments and refuses to return them. L&#x2019;s husband avers that the garments were deposited with him as security against a debt.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the garments are not now in the husband&#x2019;s possession, or if they were identified in his possession as L&#x2019;s garments, he must return them to L, for a wife&#x2019;s garments are in the category of objects that are usually lent or rented out, regarding which one may not claim that he has bought them (Sheb. 46b). If no one, however, saw the garments in the husband&#x2019;s possession, we uphold his claim; since if he wanted to lie he could have denied having taken them.</p>

<h1><bold>319</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A&#x2019;s wife bound herself by a ban in the presence of the people of the town, not to do a certain thing. The terms of the ban were written down, and all the townfolk signed the document. Subsequently she transgressed the ban several times, as attested to by witnesses. A transgressing woman, if properly forwarned, loses the right to her <italic>ketubah</italic>. We are doubtful, however, whether A&#x2019;s wife had to be properly forewarned before losing her right to the <italic>ketubah</italic>. We are inclined to believe that no such forewarning was necessary since she was warned at the time the ban was pronounced that she would lose the right to her <italic>ketubah</italic> should she transgress the ban, and she agreed thereto without inserting any qualifying conditions. Does A&#x2019;s wife lose the right to her <italic>ketubah?</italic> Furthermore, is A permitted to divorce her against her will?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Even if proper forewarning were required before a transgressing woman loses her right to the <italic>ketubah</italic>, one such warning would be sufficient. Otherwise a woman would be able, without any restraint, continually to cause her husband to sin. For, when forewarned by witnesses, she would temporarily abstain from sin, and, later, return to her mischief. Moreover, any situation that would require the administration of testing-water to a <italic>Sotah</italic> (a woman suspected of faithlessness), would cause her to lose the right to her <italic>ketubah;</italic> and the forewarning of a jealous husband, even though preceding by many days the seclusion of his wife with another man, would require the administration of testing-water, as evidenced by the statement of the Baraita (Yeb. 58b): the jealous forewarning of a betrothed would require the administration of testing-water after she married [if she secluded herself with that other man after the marriage took place]. Therefore, a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede a transgression immediately.</p>
<p>The question was again sent to R. Meir: A&#x2019;s wife brought witnesses who testified before us that A also had transgressed the ban. We decided, therefore, that she did not lose the right to her <italic>ketubah</italic>, since she did not intend to commit a sin. Moreover, a woman must be forewarned immediately before committing a sin in order to be classified as a transgressing woman. The Baraita cited above offers no proof to the contrary since it deals with a case where the sinful seclusion immediately followed the jealous forewarning (i. e. the seclusion took place before the marriage).</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. I still believe that a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede the transgression immediately. Thus Rashi offers two interpretations of the aforementioned Baraita. The first, and most important, interpretation assumes that the seclusion took place after the marriage, and, thus, long after the jealous forewarning. Moreover, the Talmud (Sotah 26a) clearly states that a woman who was jealously forewarned before her marriage and secluded herself with another man after the marriage, must either drink the testing-water or lose the right to her <italic>ketubah</italic>. However, since A too has transgressed the ban, we must make two distinctions. a) If the wife&#x2019;s sin consisted of merely disregarding the ban, while her act was not sinful in itself, A is not permitted to divorce her; for transgressing a ban causes the death of the transgressor&#x2019;s children, and is, therefore, ground for divorce; but, since A himself transgressed the ban, he can have no objection to a similar act on the part of his wife. b) If A&#x2019;s wife, however, transgressed Mosaic law and Jewish custom, A is permitted to divorce her even against her will; he need not seek the consent of the communities, and he is not required to pay her the <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Up to the present the custom was prevalent in our country to enforce the collection of <italic>ketuboth</italic> written many years previously to their being presented for collection even when such <italic>ketuboth</italic> bore witnesses&#x2019; signatures that were not known to the court. Recently, however, some defendants disputed the authenticity of a certain <italic>ketubah</italic> and demanded legal identification of the signatures on the document. Since no such identification was possible, the case was protracted by the defendants and the woman was forced to reach a compromise and accept a less amount than that written in her <italic>ketubah</italic>. From now on this procedure will probably be followed by all other defendants in similar cases [which will cause great hardship to widows and divorcees]. I have before me a Responsum of Rabbi Menahem who rules that a woman who lost her <italic>ketubah</italic>-document did not thereby lose her right even to the additional jointure. Although the consensus of opinion is that the additional jointure is also considered a <italic>maase beth-din</italic> (an obligation imposed by the Rabbis on all husbands, the existence of which obligation, therefore, need not be proved), it is considered a <italic>maase beth-din</italic> only in those countries where a standard <italic>ketubah</italic> is written for all women, containing a fixed amount of dowry and additional jointure. In our country, however, there is no general standard and each family has its own custom in this matter. Those families who follow a definite custom and write the same <italic>ketubah</italic> for all the women of the particular family, would encounter no difficulty on this score, as each woman would be entitled to collect as her <italic>ketubah</italic> the amount fixed in her family. Sometimes, however, the custom of the family is not clear and is not known even to the members of the family. In such cases the Geonim rule that when a woman has lost her <italic>ketubah-</italic>document, the <italic>ketuboth</italic> of three members of her family are to be examined and the woman should be entitled to receive the smallest of the three amounts written in these <italic>ketuboth</italic>. In our case, however, the <italic>ketubah-</italic>document was not lost and its money clause is written plainly; why should the woman be forced to take a lesser amount? Sometimes a woman has no family, or we do not know to what family she belongs, or all her relatives are dead. We should not permit that an identification of the signatures by a court be required before a woman can collect her <italic>ketubah</italic>, since in many cases indeed no such identification of signatures is possible even in <italic>ketuboth</italic> that are brought to court a short time after the wedding. Indeed, legal endorsement of <italic>ketuboth</italic> at the time of the wedding should have been required, but we never heard that our forefathers or teachers insisted upon such endorsement. Moreover, we should restrain a husband from living with his wife unless her <italic>ketubah</italic> bears a legal endorsement, since without such endorsement her <italic>ketubah</italic> is useless. Why is no attention paid to this matter? Perhaps the reason is that, unlike bonds and notes of indebtedness, the identification of the signatures on <italic>ketuboth</italic> is not required and not necessary. Perhaps also we do not suspect that women would forge <italic>ketuboth</italic>, for the reason that not one woman in a thousand knows how to write, nor are women familiar with the required legal phraseology. Nor do we suspect that persons who know how to write would be so degraded as to write forged <italic>ketuboth</italic> for the benefit of others.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. I have considered your problem in all its aspects and could find no solution for it, unless each family should write an equal amount of additional jointure for all its members. If a family has no established custom of writing a uniform <italic>ketubah</italic> for all its members, the procedure prescribed by the Geonim and mentioned above, must be followed, unless the signatures on the <italic>ketubah</italic> can be identified. We do indeed suspect that the woman had a scribe write a forged <italic>ketubah</italic> for her, or even that a scribe wrote several <italic>ketuboth</italic> for her which she expects to present for collection at different courts.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. L&#x2019;s husband was killed on a day of rioting and massacre. L lost her <italic>ketubah-</italic>document; is she entitled to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic>?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. L is entitled to collect the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic>, since no document is required to prove the existence of an obligation classified as <italic>maase-beth-din</italic>, an obligation imposed by the Rabbis on all husbands alike, as a mere verbal claim of having discharged such obligation is of no avail unless one can produce documentary evidence (B. M. 17b). Therefore, if L can prove through witnesses that her husband married her as a maiden, she will be entitled to collect two hundred <italic>zuzim</italic> as her <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic>; otherwise she will be entitled to collect only one hundred <italic>zuzim</italic>. As to the fifty pounds of dowry and fifty pounds of additional jointure that we generally include in the <italic>ketubah</italic> of our wives, I am doubtful whether these sums may be considered as <italic>maase-beth-din</italic>. It seems to me, however, that since we have a firmly established custom throughout our kingdom to write the aforementioned amounts in the <italic>ketubah</italic> of all maidens, the same law should apply to these amounts as to a <italic>maase-beth-din</italic>. We should, therefore, not put forth the claim, for the benefit of the heirs, that the widow has already received payment of the dowry and the additional jointure. Moreover, since witnesses testify that L and her husband lived a normal married life when he was killed, we can not put forth the claim that she has already received payment of the aforementioned amounts, for we have no reason for supposing that the husband deposited valuables with L to be used in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>. Thus Rabbi Simon of Jointville ruled that when a man suddenly dies we need not suppose that he deposited valuables with his wife to be used by her in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, for while he is alive the <italic>ketubah</italic> is not an obligation requiring payment, and as long as he is well, he does not think of the possibility of his death.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. How much money is a woman entitled to collect as her <italic>ketubah</italic>, upon divorce or the death of her husband?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The amount of money to which a woman is entitled as her <italic>ketubah</italic>, is dependent on local custom. In W&#x00FC;rzburg and its vicinity, the dowry and the additional jointure are valued at one hundred pounds of two <italic>marks</italic> per pound; in the Rhine communities, it seems to me, they are valued at one hundred <italic>marks</italic>. These sums do not include the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic> of two hundred <italic>zuzim</italic>, or five hundred pennyweights of silver, each <italic>zuz</italic> equalling two and one half pennyweights of silver. If no custom, as to the value of the <italic>ketubah</italic>, exists in your town, you should follow the custom of the town where the wedding took place. If no such custom exists there, you ought to follow the custom of the community nearest to you to which you usually look for guidance. But, if no such custom exists in the latter, the women of your locality are entitled to collect one hundred pounds of the coins current there, plus five hundred pennyweights of silver. Before a woman may collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> she must take an oath that she did not give away or waste (while her husband was alive or after his death) anything belonging to her husband, and that she did not retain anything for herself. Everything she takes from the husband&#x2019;s house, such as her bedding or her clothes even, is to be appraised and deducted from her <italic>ketubah</italic>. The orphans are to pay the balance due her either in real property or in moveable property, whichever they prefer.</p>

<h1><bold>323</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. What is the value of the one hundred pounds that a person obligates himself, in the <italic>ketubah</italic> document, to pay to his wife in case of death or divorce?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. In W&#x00FC;rzburg a well established local custom is followed to permit a woman to collect two hundred <italic>marks</italic>. This custom, however, is not logical, for the term &#x201C;pound&#x201D; is thus interpreted to mean a pound by weight (16 ounces) which is equivalent to two <italic>marks</italic>. But if this interpretation is correct why do we not explicitly write in the <italic>ketubah</italic>: &#x201C;one hundred pounds by weight&#x201D;? Thus, I once saw my teacher and relative Rabbi Judah haKohen order the insertion of such phrase in the <italic>ketubah</italic> of one of his relatives. Since, however, we unqualifiedly write &#x201C;one hundred pounds&#x201D;, we probably mean the coin &#x201C;pound&#x201D; and refer to the largest money unit current in the particular town. Rabbi Simha established the custom of paying the widow or divorcee one hundred <italic>marks</italic> as her <italic>ketubah</italic>, thus interpreting the above mentioned phrase to mean one hundred pounds of heavy coins (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05F4;&#x05E9;</span>), one pound of which is equivalent to a <italic>mark</italic>. Indeed, I have heard that in Worms only one hundred pounds <italic>Heller</italic> are paid; this custom of paying pounds current in the particular town seems to me preferable to all other customs. However, one must follow the custom of his locality. In the absence of a local custom, the custom of the town where the wedding took place should be followed. If no custom exists in this town either, one should pay one hundred pounds of the coins current in his present place of abode or in the town where the wedding took place &#x2014; whichever is of lower value<xref rid="fn10">&#x002A;</xref>.</p>

<p>a) <italic>Q</italic>. A married L in Mayence, or in another locality, where the <italic>ketubah</italic> is valued at two hundred <italic>marks</italic>. They then removed to a different locality where the <italic>ketubah</italic> is valued at much less. They lived in the latter place until A&#x2019;s death. How much money is L entitled to as her <italic>ketubah</italic>?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The opinion of R. Simon b. Gamaliel (Ket. 110b) is accepted that a woman is entitled to the <italic>ketubah</italic> current in the locality where her marriage took place.</p>
<p>b) <italic>Q</italic>. After A died L took over, and managed, his estate. Why, then, did you write that the estate was considered, nevertheless, to be in the possession of the orphans?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. R. Hananel decided that the estate managed by the widow is considered to be in the possession of the orphans. The widow is merely a managing trustee. Therefore, all the profit accruing because of her management, belongs to the orphans and she can not collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> therefrom. When the widow demands her <italic>ketubah</italic> she loses her right to receive her sustenance from the estate. She must, then, take an oath while holding the Scroll of the Law; and whatever she thus states under oath to have given away, or to have retained for herself, to have given to her daughter, or to have given to charity, is deducted from her <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>
<p>c) <italic>Q</italic>. L lent some of the money to lords and &#x201C;men of violence&#x201D;, and it is doubtful whether the latter will pay their debts.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. L is responsible for these bad investments. Ordinarily when heirs pay the <italic>ketubah</italic> to a widow, they may give her in payment any kind of property, or any object even bran; but they cannot pay her by transferring to her money due them from others, since the collection of debts often involves litigations to which a woman is not accustomed. However, in our case, the orphans may transfer to L the money she has invested with the lords and the &#x201C;men of violence&#x201D;, in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, since she had no right to make such unsafe investments.</p>
<p>d) <italic>Q</italic>. While L managed the estate she gave presents to certain persons thinking she had the right to do so. Are the orphans entitled to take back the presents?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The recipients are entitled to retain these presents since they may claim that L gave them out of her own property, and since it appears that the market ordinance (<italic>takkanat hashuk</italic>) was to apply to property given away as presents.</p>
<p>e) <italic>Q</italic>. Do we put forth the claim for the benefit of the orphans that L may have been a widow when she married A, or that A may have paid her one <italic>Mina</italic>.?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. We surely put forth the above claims for the benefit of the orphans. However, if a report circulates that L was a virgin when she married A, she is entitled to the <italic>ketubah</italic> of a virgin, since the majority of women are married while virgins. [The principle of &#x201C;a majority of cases&#x201D; presumes that what is true in most instances, is also true in our case.] Although in litigation over money matters the principle of &#x201C;a majority of cases&#x201D; is not a factor, it is so when the claimant is in actual possession of the litigated money. In our case, L is in actual possession of the money; therefore, the combination of a &#x201C;majority&#x201D; and a &#x201C;report&#x201D; in her favor, is conclusive.</p>

How much is the woman entitled to collect?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. It all depends upon the custom of the place where the woman married. In W&#x00FC;rzburg and its surrounding country, the one hundred pounds of the <italic>ketubah</italic> are interpreted to mean two hundred <italic>marks</italic>. On the Rhine, there are places where the one hundred pounds of the <italic>ketubah</italic> are interpreted to mean one hundred pounds <italic>Heller</italic>.

<p><italic>A</italic>. A mere claim to the effect that the articles had formed part of her <italic>ketubah</italic> would have been insufficient.

<p>Rabbi Perez took issue with Rabbi Meir quoting Alfasi&#x2019;s decision that the ordinance of Usha &#x2014; which ruled that a person who divided all of his property among his children may derive his sustenance as well as that of his wife&#x2019;s from such property &#x2014; was not accepted.</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir reproved Rabbi Perez for resorting to Alfasi when the Talmud specifically decided that the ordinance of Usha was not accepted. R. Meir contended, however, that only that part of the ordinance was not accepted which gave the right to the donor, and to his wife while he was alive, to derive their sustenance from the property he had given away; while the rule that the widow may collect her sustenance or her <italic>ketubah</italic> from such property after the donor&#x2019;s death, was accepted before the ordinance of Usha was promulgated, and has remained in force independently of such ordinance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile L&#x2019;s relatives have written to Rabbi Meir asking for his decsion in this matter. R. Meir answered that he usually refrained from sending legal opinions to litigants, or to their relatives, and confined his responses to judges. But, when Rabbi Perez, in his second letter, gave the names of the litigants, R. Meir realized that the letters from L&#x2019;s relatives dealt with the same case. R. Meir recalled that among these letters was found a letter from Rabbi Asher which explained the circumstances of the gift mentioned above. Therefore, R. Meir added (in his second letter to Rabbi Perez) that since according to Rabbi Asher&#x2019;s letter, the donor mentioned the contingency of death when he summoned Rabbi Asher, he therefore made the gift to his son <italic>causa mortis</italic> (cf. B. B. 151a), and a widow is undoubtedly entitled to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from <italic>causa mortis</italic> gifts.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A&#x2019;s widow, Leah, and his children put forth their claims, through representatives, regarding real property left to A by his mother on condition that after A&#x2019;s death the property be transferred to A&#x2019;s children and not be used to pay Leah&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>. Leah claimed that the said property never belonged to A&#x2019;s mother since the latter received it in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, but failed to take the required oath before collecting such <italic>ketubah</italic>. Leah, therefore, demanded her <italic>ketubah</italic> from this property. A&#x2019;s sons, then, produced a document to the effect that A, foregoing the required oath, permitted his mother to take the property of his deceased father in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, and bestowed upon her as a gift whatever amount the property was worth in excess of her <italic>ketubah</italic>. Leah, however, claimed that as soon as her father-in-law died, his property, automatically falling to her husband, was subject to the lien of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, and that A, therefore, had no right to waive the oath his mother was required to take and to bestow gifts upon her without her (Leah&#x2019;s) permission.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The property belongs to the grandchildren who were already born at the time the gift was made by A&#x2019;s mother, and Leah cannot collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> therefrom. We have no proof that A&#x2019;s mother received more than the amount specified in the <italic>ketubah</italic>. A&#x2019;s document bestowing on his mother as a gift whatever she received over and above her <italic>ketubah</italic> does not prove that she actually received more than was due her. Leah&#x2019;s claim that A had no right to bestow gifts without her permission is valid only in regard to real property, but a husband may sell or give away personal property without his wife&#x2019;s permission. Therefore, A&#x2019;s mother had a right to give her property to A and to his children. Moreover, since Leah is not certain that A&#x2019;s mother collected more than her <italic>ketubah</italic>, and can take no oath to that effect, the property goes to A&#x2019;s children.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. In order to be entitled to her <italic>ketubah</italic>, a widow must take an oath that she did not steal, retain, or use any of her husband&#x2019;s property in any manner not specifically permitted by her husband. It is, however, only natural for a wife, during her marital status, to donate small sums of her husband&#x2019;s money (to relatives or to charity) without the husband&#x2019;s knowledge. Of such money, she usually keeps no account, and is not in a position to remember each donation. How, then, can a widow take this oath without violating her conscience?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the widow can not approximate the exact sum she spent without her husband&#x2019;s knowledge or permission, let her forego a great part of her <italic>ketubah</italic> rather than hazard the taking of a false oath.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A set apart the land upon which he dwelt for the payment of his wife&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>. After his death, the trustee of the orphans demanded that A&#x2019;s widow take an oath to the effect that she did not appropriate anything that belonged to her husband, before she be permitted to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from this real estate. Is the trustee justified in his demand?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since the property was mortgaged to A&#x2019;s widow, she is now considered to be in possession of her <italic>ketubah</italic>. And as long as she does not demand her <italic>ketubah</italic>, she is not required to take an oath (Ket. 87b) unless the orphans claim positive knowledge of her having appropriated anything that belonged to their father. Therefore, A&#x2019;s widow is not required to take an oath.</p>

Immediately after the formal release, however, A said to his mother that since this real property was mortgaged, her release was not to become effective till she redeem it for him. L promised to redeem it. Now, however, she refuses to do so.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Unless L redeem the above property, her agreement with A is void, for A&#x2019;s last stipulation proves that he had originally agreed to release L on condition only that she transfer the property to him unencumbered by mortgages. Moreover, a stipulation made immediately after an agreement is concluded, but while the matter is still being discussed, becomes part of the agreement (B. B. 114a).</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. L, a widow, summons to court her father&#x2019;s half-brother, A, who with L&#x2019;s father were children of the same father, B, but not of the same mother, and claims that the movables, immovables, and books which A inherited from his mother did not belong to his mother since she did not take the required oath regarding her <italic>ketubah</italic>. A avers that his mother told him: a) that his father, B, left no money beyond what was necessary to repay his debts; b) that he left a house, vineyards, and books; and c) that he gave her the house and the vineyards as an outright gift. A further claims: a) that his father gave him the books as a gift; b) that his father freed his mother from the necessity of taking an oath and forewent the return of any money she might have taken from him; c) that the above transactions were properly recorded by B in a written instrument; and d) that A&#x2019;s brothers and even L and her husband, forwent their claims against his mother and gave her written instruments to that effect.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A was in undisturbed possesssion of the litigated immovables for three years, or if his mother had dug pits and trenches in the immovables or had sold parts thereof three years prior to her death, we uphold A&#x2019;s claim if supported by an oath, since he had recourse to a <italic>miggo</italic> (he could have claimed that he had purchased the immovables from his brothers, or that his mother had purchased them); otherwise, A must return the immovables to his father&#x2019;s estate. Regarding the books, however, if witnesses did not see B&#x2019;s books in A&#x2019;s possession, A would be entitled to retain them upon taking an oath in support of his claim. If witnesses saw B&#x2019;s books in A&#x2019;s possession A would have to return them to the estate. L, on the other hand, will not be entitled to any part of the property thus returned to the estate, unless she takes an oath to the effect that she had never relinquished her rights to such property.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. When A died he was survived by his wife, L, his son, C, and his daughter. Subsequently L married B and brought him as her dowry that which she had taken from A&#x2019;s estate, namely: fifty <italic>marks</italic> and a half interest in A&#x2019;s books. The other half interest in the books she gave to her son C. The money and books, however, did not cover the amount L was entitled to according to her <italic>ketubah</italic>. Furthermore, when L gave her money to B she stipulated that he clothe and sustain her son and daughter, that he hire teachers for her son, and that he provide a dowry for her daughter. When C grew up, B decided to dissolve his partnership with C in the books. He invited the worthies of the community and in their presence the books were equally divided by lot between B and C. Subsequently L died. Whereupon C demanded that B return to him all he had received from L, since the latter had not taken the required oath regarding her <italic>ketubah</italic> and consequently had nothing of her own to give to B.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Unless C can prove that L had taken from A&#x2019;s estate more than the amount that was due her according to her <italic>ketubah</italic>, B owes nothing to C. If L were alive she would have been required to take an oath regarding her <italic>ketubah</italic>, but no oath is required of her heirs. However, if L gave immovables to B, as part of her dowry, the burden of proof regarding L&#x2019;s title to these immovables would lie with B, for the legal advantage enjoyed by the litigant who is in possession of the litigated money, is entirely absent when immovables are the subjects of the litigation.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. L, A&#x2019;s widow who has had no children with A, gave away his books to religious (or charitable) institutions of two or three communities, before she took the required oath regarding her <italic>ketubah</italic>. A&#x2019;s heirs summoned her to court claiming that she had taken from A more than was due her according to her <italic>ketubah</italic>. L appeared in court and was ready to take the required oath regarding her <italic>ketubah</italic>, but died before she could do so. L&#x2019;s trustee asked the judges how to dispose of the books that were entrusted to him, and the judges instructed him to deliver them to the donee institutions. Now A&#x2019;s heirs demand the return of these books.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. This is a highly controversial subject. The court of W&#x00FC;rzburg &#x2014; and I believe also of Speyer, following a decision by R. Simha &#x2014; usually follow the decision of R. Eliezer (Shebu. 48a) which in our case would be in favor of the donees. However, we follow the ruling of Rav and Samuel (ibid.) that the entire estate belongs to the heirs. According to our opinion, therefore, even if the donee has already taken possession of the widow&#x2019;s gift, it should be returned to the heirs; but, if the donee has originally taken possession of the gift at the instruction of a court, we usually uphold the court&#x2019;s decision on the assumption that the court has followed the opinion of R. Eliezer (ibid. 48b). However, you state that the court has also decided that L&#x2019;s heirs have no claim on A&#x2019;s estate; they followed, therefore, the opinion of Rav and Samuel. Thus their decision in favor of the donees can no longer be construed as following the opinion of R. Eliezer, and must be considered a mere error.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Leah, A&#x2019;s widow who was now the wife of C, had taken the proper oath regarding her <italic>ketubah</italic> before a court, whereupon the court had transferred to her A&#x2019;s house in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>. This house had been originally given to A by his father, B, who had distributed the rest of his property among his (B&#x2019;s) sons-in-law as gifts <italic>causa mortis</italic>. B&#x2019;s sons-in-law now claim to possess a deed to the effect that B gave the house to A with the stipulation that, in case A died childless, the house should belong to B&#x2019;s daughters. [Since A died childless] B&#x2019;s sons-in-law demand the house.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since A was the legal heir to the house, B had no power to terminate A&#x2019;s normal right of conveying his inheritance to his heirs (cf. B. B. 133a). Therefore, B&#x2019;s stipulation limiting A&#x2019;s normal right of inheritance was void; the house unreservedly belonged to A, and Leah, his widow, had the right to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> therefrom.</p>

<h1><bold>341</bold></h1>
<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. A married a widow, B, and lived with her for eight years till her death. B had not taken the customary widow&#x2019;s oath regarding her <italic>ketubah</italic> due her from her former husband. When she married A she was not considered very rich and no one suspected that she owned more than the value of her <italic>ketubah</italic>. But, after her death, when A declared, under oath, to the community (leaders, probably for purposes of taxation) the value of his assets, it was discovered that he had inherited from B more than the value of her <italic>ketubah</italic> from her former husband. The heirs of the latter, therefore, demand that A return the excess to them.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the valuables B brought to A were undistinguishable and no one recognized them as having belonged to B&#x2019;s former husband, A is free from obligation for five reasons. a) Even if the valuables B brought to A were worth more than the value of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, such valuables may not all necessarily have come from the estate of her former husband, for she might have received some gifts or found a treasure. b) Were B still alive she would have been obliged to take an oath [to the effect that she did not take from her former husband more than the value of her <italic>ketubah</italic>], but now that she is dead, A is free from the obligation of taking an oath, since he is not supposed to know his wife&#x2019;s affairs. c) A is not even required to take the oath of an heir &#x2014; that B never told him, and that he did not know that she had received from the estate of her former husband more than the value of her <italic>ketubah</italic> &#x2014; since the heirs of B&#x2019;s former husband are not positive in their claim. The heirs, however, may pronounce the ban (<italic>herem</italic>) in the synagogue against anyone who does possess such knowledge and does not reveal it. Such ban would include A. d) Whatever a person would have retained, had he taken an oath, his heirs may retain without the necessity of taking an oath. e) Some authorities require A to take the oath of an heir; but since many great authorities absolve him from such oath, and since A is in possession of the aforesaid valuables, the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff. For similar reasons A would be free from the obligation of taking an oath, even if some of the valuables brought to him by B were distinguishable and were recognized as having belonged to B&#x2019;s former husband, if the valuables thus recognized were in themselves not worth more than the value of B&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>. But, if the distinguishable valuables are in themselves worth more than the value of B&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>, A must return the difference to the heirs of B&#x2019;s first husband.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. Witnesses have testified to the effect that B and her former husband, C, had made a binding agreement that in the event of the death of one party, the surviving party would share the property with the heirs. After C&#x2019;s death, B settled with all of C&#x2019;s heirs, except the youngest, D, who was born after the drawing up of the agreement. D, therefore, is now pressing his claim.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. D was entitled to his share even though he was born after the agreement was made, for in it B did not bestow benefits on anybody; she merely relinquished her rights to C&#x2019;s property up to a certain extent, and D later became heir to the relinquished property. However, A may claim that B brought him nothing from C&#x2019;s estate, or he may contend that B had already settled with D, and be free from obligation for the reasons enumerated above.</p>

<h1><bold>342</bold></h1>
<p><italic>Q</italic>. A drew up a legal document in which he used the following words: &#x201C;Effective as of today, but to be executed after our (meaning himself and his wife, L) deaths, our daughter R shall inherit an equal share with her brothers, those already born and those that might be born, in whatever will remain of my estate.&#x201D; After A&#x2019;s death, his children and his widow, L, interpreted the document to mean that A had appointed L trustee over his estate. When L proved a very inefficient, careless, and wasteful trustee, A&#x2019;s sons reached an agreement with L, whereby she was to receive forty <italic>marks</italic> for turning over the estate to A&#x2019;s sons immediately. Before relinquishing her trusteeship, L and her youngest son B (who was eighteen years of age) agreed to allow R&#x2019;s husband to take his wife&#x2019;s share of the estate immediately, without having to wait for L&#x2019;s death. A&#x2019;s two other sons object to this latter agreement.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A&#x2019;s heirs were entitled to take over his estate at any time they wished to do so. The giving of forty <italic>marks</italic> to L in order that she relinquish her trusteeship, was entirely unnecessary, for A&#x2019;s document, while making the collection of R&#x2019;s share in A&#x2019;s estate dependant on L&#x2019;s death, did not appoint L trustee of said estate. Moreover, had A explicitly appointed L trustee of his estate, the court would have removed her at no expense to the heirs, since she had proven to be inefficient, careless, and wasteful. The second agreement is not binding on A&#x2019;s two sons since L, not being a trustee of the estate, had no legal power to dispose of part of the estate. B, however, was able to forego his own part of R&#x2019;s share, and his act is binding upon such part if R (or her husband) was in possession of her share at the time of the latter agreement. Thus R would be entitled to receive one third of her share (B&#x2019;s part of her share) immediately, while B&#x2019;s two brothers would manage the other two-thirds for their own profit and gain until L&#x2019;s death.</p>
<p>Although the brothers are entitled to manage R&#x2019;s share for their own profit, they are not permitted to sell or otherwise alienate any part of it; and their responsibility thereto would be that of a gratuitous watchman. Thus any increase that will accrue until L&#x2019;s death will belong to the brothers, while, any decrease of value caused by theft, loss or unavoidable accident will be suffered by R. Should the brothers be called upon to pay L her <italic>ketubah</italic>, one quarter of such payment should come out of R&#x2019;s share. R may not claim that her father has made her an outright gift, free of any lien or obligation, since A did not intend to give R a greater share than that of his sons. After L&#x2019;s death, R may exact an oath from her brothers to the effect that they did not retain for themselves anything belonging to her.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. L&#x2019;s trustee claimed that L&#x2019;s property which she had given to her husband, had been given only to gratify him, but had not been intended as an outright gift. Therefore, this property had belonged to L; and she gave it to her mother by right.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. This property was not listed in L&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>, and was thus considered <italic>niksei melug</italic> regarding which a woman may not claim that her gift thereof to her husband was not actually meant to be binding but was given in order to gratify him (B. B. 50a). Therefore, the gift was binding, and she no longer had any claim to said property. She had no right to give it to her mother.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A rented a house to B for five years and received the rent for the entire period in advance. He promised to repay B the expenses for any structures he might erect in the house, and gave him a written guaranty to this effect. B spent six pounds on such structures. Subsequently, A died and his widow, L, took over the house in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. B must vacate the house; for L&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic> was a lien upon it, before it was rented to B. L may remove anyone from the house, whether buyer, renter, or creditor; provided, of course, that her marriage to A took place, and A was owner of the house, before he sold it, rented it, or borrowed money. Therefore, if A left no movables and his estate does not exceed L&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>, B can not reclaim his money. If, however, A left movables with a third person, these movables ought to be turned over to B in payment of the obligation due him, and any excess should go to L. Whenever a creditor and a widow press their claims to an estate consisting of movables &#x2014; unless the movables had previously been set aside by the husband for the payment of his wife&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic> &#x2014; the creditor has priority over the widow. The creditor&#x2019;s priority, however, as against the widow extends only to the payment of the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic>, the additional jointure, and that part of the dowry which the husband wrote in the <italic>ketubah</italic> in excess of what she actually gave him as dowry &#x2014; thus in our <italic>ketubah</italic> we uniformly write that the wife brought in a dowry worth fifty pounds, regardless of the actual value of her dowry, and in our country a woman collects one hundred <italic>marks</italic> as her dowry, since we interpret the term &#x201C;pound&#x201D; to be a pound of weight, consisting of two <italic>marks</italic>. In regard to whatever the widow actually brought in as dowry she is considered a creditor sharing equally with other creditors in collecting from movables. Although a woman is entitled to collect the entire amount her husband wrote in the dowry clause of her <italic>ketubah</italic> in excess of what she actually brought in, she does not have equal right with a creditor in collecting that excess. Therefore, since in collecting her actual dowry from movables, L is on an equal footing with B, the movables mentioned above must be equally divided between L and B (and not in proportion to the respective obligations). When an estate consists of movables and immovables, and the latter do not suffice to cover the <italic>ketubah</italic>, the widow collects the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic>, the additional jointure, and the excess dowry, from the immovables, while she takes her part of the movables in payment of her actual dowry. The creditor may not claim that the immovables taken by the widow are in payment of her actual dowry, while she may not collect the rest of the <italic>ketubah</italic> from the movables until he, the creditor, collects his full debt therefrom, for the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic> and the additional jointure are liens upon the immovables, while in regard to the actual dowry she is considered a creditor entitled to share with the other creditors in collecting from movables (cf. Ket. 86a).</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. After L, a widow, remarried, she presented for collection the <italic>ketubah</italic> she had received from her first husband. In the absence of unencumbered property, L sought to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from a piece of the real estate which her former husband had sold to A. A, in turn, had sold the real estate to B; and after the latter&#x2019;s death, it fell to his orphans some of whom were minors. L contended that her husband had sold the real estate without her consent, and without obtaining her signature to the deed.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If L will take an oath to the effect that she did not as yet collect any part of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, and that she did not consent to the sale of the above property, she will be entitled to evict B&#x2019;s heirs from it. The talmudic statement you quote in the query: &#x201C;after a widow remarries, the burden of proof lies on her shoulders (ket. 96b)&#x201D;, does not apply to a case where the widow seeks to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic>. Moreover, the <italic>ketubah</italic>-document in itself constitutes adequate and sufficient proof of the fact that the widow did not collect her <italic>ketubah</italic>. The fact that B&#x2019;s heirs are able to prove three years of undisturbed possession, also has no bearing on the case. A widow is not required to protest the occupancy by another of real property which does not belong to her, but which she may eventually come to seize in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. The orphans are justified in their demand that the widow take an oath regarding the property she has squandered or given away. Although the Yerushalmi rules that a widow who seized the property of her late husband is not required to render an accounting, Ritzba (R. Isaak b. Abraham) is of the opinion that this ruling of the Yerushalmi applies only when the widow is expected eventually to take an oath regarding her <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. A acted within his rights. The ruling of the Talmud (Ket. 86a), which gives the debtor precedence over the widow in the settlement of an estate, is to be enforced even if the widow has already seized her husband&#x2019;s property.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A widow demands her <italic>ketubah</italic> and a creditor demands his money from an estate. Who has priority in collecting from the estate?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The creditor has priority over the widow. Moreover, even when the estate consists of assets only to satisfy one of the claimants, the creditor is paid in preference to the widow. In our times, since the creditor as well as the widow collects from unencumbered movables, the creditor has priority over the widow in collecting from such movables.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A creditor demanded his money from a critically ill person. The latter admitted the indebtedness and ordered his heirs to repay the debt. Do you follow the decision of R. Tam that a widow has priority over a creditor in collecting (her <italic>ketubah</italic>) from movables, or the decision of Alfasi and the Geonim that the creditor has priority over the widow?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. No difference of opinion exists between R. Tam and the Geonim in regard to this law. Even the former admits that nowadays, when the ordinance of the Saburaim gives the creditor the right to collect his debt from movables even after the debtor&#x2019;s death, the creditor has priority over the widow in collecting from movables.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. If the trustee cannot produce A&#x2019;s note of indebtedness, he has no claim against L, since she may deny the indebtedness altogether, or may maintain that her husband repaid his debt to the charity-chest. If the trustee, however, produces A&#x2019;s note of indebtedness, the signatures of which were identified in court, he takes precedence over L in collecting from A&#x2019;s estate. Even if L has already taken possession of A&#x2019;s valuables in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>, these must be taken away from her and given to the trustee in payment of A&#x2019;s debt. We rendered a similar decision in Frankfort some time ago.</p>

<p>1) <italic>Q</italic>. A owed one <italic>minah</italic> to B. He promised that he would repay the money on a specified date, or that his sureties, C and D, would either repay it themselves or would eat two meals a day to be charged to A. A made a binding promise to C and D, accompanied by a solemn hand-clasp, to compensate them for any losses they might suffer on account of their suretyship; and he gave them a written document to that effect. Before the debt fell due, however, A died leaving orphans and a widow, but not enough property to cover the latter&#x2019;s <italic>ketubah</italic>. B demands that the sureties either eat at the expense of A&#x2019;s estate, or pay him one <italic>minah</italic>. Who has priority in collecting from the estate, the creditor or the widow? Is this case similar to the case when interest is accumulating on the obligations of young orphans [in which case the court must attend immediately to the affairs of the estate in order to save the money of the orphans], or is it not similar to this case for the reason that in our case the orphans can receive no part of the estate in any event?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Nowadays that a creditor may collect his debt from the movables of an estate, he has priority over the widow in collecting from movables. The orphans are not considered at all in this case, since they can receive no part of the estate in any event.</p>
<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. When A married L she had small children. She said to A that she would give him a dowry of thirty <italic>marks</italic>, and would keep her remaining twenty <italic>marks</italic> for her children. The twenty <italic>marks</italic>, however, were not kept separately and they (A and L) did business with the entire sum. Subsequently A died, and L claimed that the greater part of the money he left belonged to her young children. Do we assume that since A did business with the money it belonged to him?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If the money is in L&#x2019;s possession and we have no evidence (but her admission) that she possesses it, L must take an oath in support of her claim. We must be satisfied with this oath since she could have successfully denied possessing the money. But, if the money is not in her possession, or we have evidence that she possesses it, she must produce witnesses in support of her claim.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A widow seized notes of indebtedness and bonds of Gentiles, that were made out both in her name and in the name of her husband. Does this act constitute seizure of the debts?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The widow has to produce evidence to the effect that the money represented by the notes and the bonds was actually her money. Furthermore, possession of notes and bonds, does not imply the right to the money and property described therein. Thus seizure of the notes and the bonds does not constitute seizure of the debts.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A left four daughters and no sons. His widow claims that B owed money to her deceased husband, and seeks to recover it in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. In talmudic times a widow could collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from real property only; therefore, it is stated in the Talmud that when a person dies, his debtors or depositaries shall repay their obligations to the person&#x2019;s heirs and not to his widow. But, the Geonim enacted a law that a woman may collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from movable property and even from property her husband has given away to his heirs before his death. Nowadays, then, a woman may collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from her husband&#x2019;s property in the hands of debtors and depositaries. Therefore, if the widow will swear that A did not leave her enough property to cover her <italic>ketubah</italic>, B must pay her the money he owed A. If B denies that he owes anything to A, he must take an oath to that effect and be free from obligation.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Does a woman collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from a loan that has been secured by a pledge at the time the loan was contracted? Does a first-born son receive a double share from such a loan?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A woman may collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from all loans, even from loans that are not secured by pledges. Nowadays especially, since a woman may collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from movables &#x2014; and even after the loan is repaid to the orphans she may demand the money thus repaid in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic> &#x2014; she is entitled to collect directly from the debtor. Moreover, the custom of collecting the <italic>ketubah</italic> from movables and from loans, is well established in our time. Such a custom may be justified by the fact that the major part of our business consists of loans and investments. Similarly a first-born is entitled to a double share from a loan that had been secured by a pledge, since such a loan is not considered <italic>raui</italic> (a potential asset) but constitutes a real asset of the estate.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. A&#x2019;s widow is entitled to take the book in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>; for, wherever the book was at the time of A&#x2019;s death, it belonged to A.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>. The widow is under no obligation to pay for her husband&#x2019;s burial.

<p><italic>A</italic>. A&#x2019;s funeral expenses must be defrayed with money taken from his estate, before his widow can collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from it. Thus a person may not give away all his possessions to his heirs in the expectation that his funeral expenses would be paid from public funds (Ket. 48a); the same principle should apply when one gives away all his possessions to his wife. The claims of a creditor, however, should have priority over the decedent&#x2019;s funeral expenses, since the appropriation of a creditor&#x2019;s own money to pay another person&#x2019;s funeral expenses would constitute downright thievery. On the other hand, just as an exemption of bedding, food for thirty days, and clothing to last twelve months, is allowed to a bankrupt debtor (B. M. 113b), so an exemption of the bare funeral expenses should be allowed in the case of a decedent&#x2019;s insolvent estate as against both the creditor and the widow.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. R. Eliezer bound himself by a <italic>herem</italic> to give his daughter Gutlin, a minor, in marriage to Miriam&#x2019;s son, Isaac Levi, also a minor; and Miriam also obligated herself by a <italic>herem</italic>. Both parents put up a trust fund of three pounds for the couple, on condition that in case one of the parties dies before marriage the parents should divide between themselves the principal and the accrued interest. R. Eliezer died, and subsequently, but before her marriage, his daughter also died. A young son by a former marriage, who is also motherless, and a widow survived him. The trustee of the orphan, appointed by the community, and the widow, both made claims to one half of the trust-fund money. To whom should it be given?</p>
<p>It seems to me that the orphan is entitled to this money since it was not an actual asset at the time R. Eliezer died, and a widow collects her <italic>ketubah</italic> only from actual assets. The fact that the widow is in possession of the money, as the court gave it to her temporarily, does not make this asset any more actual as is evident from the case, quoted in the Talmud, of the woman with whom notes of indebtedness were deposited (Ket. 85a). Neither does the principle of <italic>Miggo</italic> apply to her since the money was given to her by the court and since the previous year she was obliged to make out a detailed statement of her assets, for the purpose of taxation and assessment for charity, in which statement the trust-money was listed. Signed: Moses Azriel.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. Since half of the fund which belonged to R. Eliezer was to be given to the couple on their wedding day and was to be returned to R. Eliezer in case of death, it did not leave R. Eliezer&#x2019;s possession, and was, therefore, at the time of his death, an actual asset of his estate from which his widow is entitled to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic>. The widow is further entitled to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> from the interest that accrued on the investment up to R. Eliezer&#x2019;s death, but not from the interest that accrued after his death.</p>

Therefore, the widow may retain the money she has seized for her sustenance. She need take no oath as to the amount seized, since such oath would serve no purpose. However, should she subsequently demand additional funds for her sustenance, she would have to take an oath as to the amount she seized and to the manner she used it.

These individuals may have merely reiterated the accepted custom for the sake of emphasis. Moreover, this clause is not entirely superflous even in a community where the Galilean custom prevails; for it strengthens the widow&#x2019;s position inasmuch as it makes her master of the estate, while according to the Galilean custom she is only to receive thirty-day allowances at a time. Neither does the fact that some widows in your community have been ousted from their husbands&#x2019; estates by being paid their <italic>ketubah</italic>, prove that you have adopted the Judean custom.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A wants to emigrate to Palestine, but his wife, L, refuses to accompany him. Is he permitted to divorce her?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The Talmud (Ket. 110b) rules that under the circumstances, the husband is permitted to divorce his wife and is not required to pay her the <italic>ketubah</italic>. Although some scholars believe that this talmudic ruling applied only during the period of the Temple, while Israel dwelt on his land, and that it does not apply at present, we must make no such distinction, for the contradiction between the statement of the Babylonian Talmud (ibid.) and that of the Palestinian Talmud (Ket. end), may be reconciled if we assume that the latter refers to the present. Regarding the payment of the <italic>ketubah</italic>, however, A is not required to pay L the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic> and the additional jointure, but he is required to pay her whatever she has brought in as her dowry (<italic>niksei tson barzel</italic>) and whatever is left of her <italic>niksei melug</italic> (private property of the wife). Moreover, should A subsequently return from Palestine, he would be required to pay L or her heirs the <italic>Ikkar ketubah</italic> and the additional jointure.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Witnesses testified that A&#x2019;s wife had committed an act forbidden to her by ban and oath. Moreover she brought forward a scoundrel who was in love with her and who threatened to kill A should he mistreat her. Is A permitted to divorce his wife against her will? Is she entitled to her <italic>ketubah?</italic></p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A is enjoined to divorce his wife since she disregarded a ban and an oath and thus transgressed against Mosaic law. The ban of Rabbenu Gershon against divorcing one&#x2019;s wife without her consent, was not directed against those husbands who perform meritorious deeds by divorcing their wives. However, since A&#x2019;s wife claims that she was not forewarned of the consequences of her deed, and A can produce no witnesses to prove that she was so forewarned, she will be entitled to collect her <italic>ketubah</italic> after receiving her divorce.</p>

<p>2) <italic>Q</italic>. A&#x2019;s wife expressed the wish that her father should inherit the two <italic>marks</italic> in case she dies before <italic>Hanukkah</italic>.

<p><italic>Q</italic>. While critically ill, A gave a bill of divorcement to his wife on condition that should he die from this illness, she should be divorced therewith from the day she receives the divorce. After the bill of divorcement was thus delivered to A&#x2019;s wife, it was torn up. Subsequently A&#x2019;s condition improved; he got up from bed, walked to the synagogue and to the market place without a cane, and even arranged his mother&#x2019;s funeral out of town. Twenty-eight days thereafter, however, he fell ill again and died. During these twenty-eight days he was at times lying in bed, and at other times he was upon his feet. Was the bill of divorcement effective?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The bill of divorcement was ineffective. First, according to R. Tam and Ri the stipulated condition mentioned above, is to be interpreted to mean that A intended the divorce to become effective an hour before his death. Since on the day of A&#x2019;s death the bill of divorcement was already torn up, no divorce took place. A similar query was sent to me from Acco (Aachen?) and I ruled that no divorce took place. I always advise women who receive such conditional divorces to guard their bills of divorcement carefully till their husbands die. Secondly, even according to Rashi, who believes that the divorce becomes effective immediately upon the delivery of the bill of divorcement, if the husband subsequently dies from his illness, the fact that A was walking thereafter without the support of a cane nullified the bill of divorcement. In any event the advice of a medical authority would be required in order to decide whether or not A died from his first illness; and nowadays we have no medical authorities on whose expert opinion we can definitely rely in such a vital matter.</p>
<p>R. Meir adds: I do not possess the <italic>Tosaphot</italic> to tractate <italic>Gittin</italic>, nor the code books from the south (Alfasi and Maimonides). I composed the above with the help of heavenly guide; if you find that the <italic>Tosaphot</italic> and the codes hold another opinion, my opinion is nullified by theirs; for what does a poor man know, one who dwells in darkness and gloom for three and one half years.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Rabbenu Tam interprets the talmudic statement: &#x201C;this is thy letter of divorce, effective as of today; if I shall die &#x2026; the divorce is valid&#x201D; (Git. 72a), to mean that such divorce becomes effective one hour before the man&#x2019;s death. According to Rabbenu Tam, therefore, what would be the status of the woman who received a letter of divorce from her husband with the provision: &#x201C;this is thy letter of divorce effective as of today, if I shall not return within the next twelve months&#x201D;, if this letter of divorce was lost or burned within the twelve months, and her husband did not return?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. You have done well to distinguish between the above two cases. Although in the former case, when the divorce is given by a critically ill person in order that his wife be not forced to accept <italic>halitzah</italic>, the phrase &#x201C;effective as of today&#x201D; is taken to mean one hour before the man&#x2019;s death, in the latter case the phrase &#x201C;effective as of today&#x201D; is to be taken literally.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. Before his death, A bequeathed sixty pounds <italic>Heller</italic> (denarii of Halle) to his brothers and sisters. His childless widow, however, retains all of A&#x2019;s property and refuses either to marry, or to take <italic>halitzah</italic> from her levir.</p>
<p>After protracted litigation, the widow (of Speyer) and her levirs finally came to court and chose their judges. These judges asked the opinion of R. Meir who put them off and advised them to ask the great (Jewish) leaders of the Kingdom (Germany) regarding the ordinances passed by the communities affecting the relations of a widow and her levirs. The leaders all agreed that after the rite of <italic>halitzah</italic> is performed, one half of the husband&#x2019;s estate belongs to the widow and one half to the levirs. R. Meir states that he knows no further details regarding these laws of the communities, and renders the following decision in accordance with talmudic law:</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. If A&#x2019;s widow, three months after his death refuses to undergo the rite of <italic>halitzah</italic> or marry her levir, she is to be considered as a rebellious wife and all of A&#x2019;s property is to be taken away from her, except that which she has brought in as a dowry, upon her marriage to A. If, however, she consents to undergo the rite of <italic>halitzah</italic>, she receives half of A&#x2019;s property, as is the <italic>Takkanah</italic> of the communities. From this amount is deducted the sum she admits, under oath, to have wasted, lost, and given away as presents, while A was alive and after his death.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A refuses to marry or give <italic>halitzah</italic> to his brother&#x2019;s childless widow claiming that, because a year has not yet passed since his brother&#x2019;s death, his deep sorrow prevents him from either marrying her or giving her <italic>halitzah</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. A&#x2019;s temporizing is baseless and useless. Our sages have decreed that three months, and not a year or two, after a person died leaving no children, his brother must either marry the widow or give her <italic>halitzah</italic>. Therefore, no temporizing is permitted. A should be coerced, either by persuasion or by flagellation, into giving <italic>halitzah</italic> to the woman immediately. Let Gentiles belabor him till he agrees to do what he is told to do. I should prefer, however, that A be misled or deceived by offers of money till he voluntarily gives her <italic>halitzah</italic>. Thus the widow may officially forego her claim to her husband&#x2019;s money that is in A&#x2019;s possession, and even bind herself thereto by a <italic>kinyan</italic>. After the ceremony the widow would still be entitled to collect this money from A, for the court that has a right to inflict corporal punishment on A, has a right to confiscate his property if it be required by considerations of public welfare. I should prefer to practice deception on A rather than inflict flagellation, since the latter might involve great hardship, have very serious consequences, and even cause A to abscond.</p>

<p><italic>Q</italic>. A believed that his brother&#x2019;s (childless) widow had retained from her husband&#x2019;s estate more than the amount due her for her <italic>ketubah</italic>, and he refused to go through with the ceremony of <italic>halitzah</italic>, unless she paid him some money. They finally agreed on the sum of 20<xref rid="fn12">&#x002A;</xref> <italic>marks</italic>. Before the ceremony of <italic>halitzah</italic> she gave the money to a trustee in A&#x2019;s presence. A said to the trustee: &#x201C;After the ceremony, you must give me the 20<xref rid="fn12">&#x002A;</xref> <italic>marks</italic>&#x201D;. To this, the trustee replied, &#x201C;I shall.&#x201D; After the ceremony, the widow produced her <italic>ketubah</italic>, swore that she had not received enough to cover same, and demanded the 20<xref rid="fn12">&#x002A;</xref> <italic>marks</italic> back. The court decided that the 20<xref rid="fn12">&#x002A;</xref> <italic>marks</italic> belong to the widow. Is the decision of the court correct?</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. The question is not sufficiently clear for us to express an opinion. If the widow told the trustee, in A&#x2019;s presence, to give the money to A after the ceremony, the money belongs to A; since this money is simply a gift which the trustee received for A&#x2019;s benefit. But, if the widow said nothing while she gave the money to the trustee, A&#x2019;s words are of no avail, and she can reclaim her money in payment of her <italic>ketubah</italic>.</p>

<p><italic>A. Bediabad</italic>, in this case, means after the rite was performed. Nevertheless, the aforementioned performance of the rite is invalid, for a different reason: the shoe used was sewed with flaxen thread and, therefore, was never fit for this purpose. Since, however, the levir performed an invalid rite of <italic>halitzah</italic>, neither he nor his brothers are now permitted to marry the widow. <italic>Halitzah</italic> by the same levir being the only manner of releasing her, he may be forced, by persuasion or by flagellation, to repeat the rite with the proper shoe.
